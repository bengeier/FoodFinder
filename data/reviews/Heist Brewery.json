{"text":"Wow, that had to be one of the worst brunches I have ever had. My wife and I arrived shortly after they opened today and were seated at a 2 person table that was wobbly, you know the kind where you have to put a sugar packet underneath it? We proceeded to the food and at first was a little taken aback by how ordinary it was. No prime rib carving station, but instead a pre-carved pork loin slices. The \"gourmet\" meat station was just pepperoni (no other deli meats), single cheese cubes, and crackers. No omelet or egg stations... The grits were runny and cold. The scrambled eggs were either powered or carton eggs that were also cold. The assorted baked goods, were mainly little muffins that I swore were Lil Bites. The sausage links were shriveled. OMG, I'm not kidding, everything was cold.  I would question whether they are testing the food temperatures.   Do yourself a favor and avoid this brunch, at $19 a person I expected a lot better and felt like I  was fleeced. I'll stick to the brunches at the Fish Market in Baxter Village or Waldhorn's Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot. Awesome atmosphere. Brunch is amazing. Great staff. They really go out of their way to make sure your experience at Heist is fantastic. The decor is really on point. They have a cozy upstairs lounge with couches and two open rooms for dining. An absolute highlight of Charlotte and a most go to if you are in the Noda area. Try the lobster Mac and cheese. So good!"}
{"text":"Pretty good beer. Staff was surprisingly uninterested in talking about their beer. Strange for a small craft brewery.   Awesome decor. Would go back just for that."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?! I love this brewery and what it has to offer.  They brew their own beer and soda and have such a fun and brilliant menu.  Beer cocktails are my new fav, one has coated bacon and sriacha!  Yummy!   Anytime I go to refill my growler with one of their new batches I am always greeted with a beaming smile from Maggie, the am bartender who is the sweetest thing since their new $7.04 lunch menu which has an amazing selection that represents our local araa code!!"}
{"text":"A step up in the local brewery scene. And finally, a brewery with a decent food menu. Unfortunately the least superior brews (comparing Birdsong, Noda Brewery and Heist), but the best atmosphere. It's a remodeled mill house, and easy walking distance from the more populated parts of NoDa. The place is huge and once the brews are perfected, I get the felling it will be super popular!"}
{"text":"So...I live a couple blocks and have been waiting for months to have this place open. Finally went over on Friday night and had an enjoyable meal there. The space is awesome and set up well. Cool little back patio, lots of tvs for games, multiple bars.  The good- the food is solid and they have an interesting menu that makes me hope once execution is dailed in will be very good. The pizzas are ok as are the apps. They add to many toppings for such thin pizza and as a result some come out soggy. This can easily be corrected and I'll leave it up to first week, but if it's like that again. No bueno...the Shrimp with Wasabi cotton candy and the bacon wrapped chicken pieces were solid. You can tell they are getting going, but food is pretty good, could be awesome if executed better as mentioned before on here, hope that comes with time. The food is a bit overpriced, but expected considering the design and the market they are going for in the neighborhood  The bad-The beer is downright awful. Not just a single beer is bad, but the whole assortment is bad...not just passable bad, like undrinkable bad. Best brewery in Charlotte? Remind me never to listen to these people's opinion on beer. If you are going for beer skip this place and go to NoDa brewing where they have a capable and talented brewmaster not some hack making watered down, flat, awful beer as if he just bought a Mr. Beer kit on the internet and boiled  a starter kit at home.   You know it's not good when your whole table has either 1 beer or a sampler then each person either doesn't finish the beer and orders an alcohol drink or wine. We left a couple half pints and multiple sampler glasses half full after the first drink order. Still shocked at how awful this place is when it comes to beer. Really deporable they call themselves a brewery.    I'd give them 1 or 2 stars if basing solely on the beer, but the food and hopes for what it can be as a new establishment garner 3. If i go again in a week or so and similiar mistakes are made with food, forget about it even with it being down the street I'll avoid. I don't know who hired the brew master, but they need to seriously drop the guy or they'll suffer as other's I've spoken to who have been have had similiar feelings. Just really amateurish beer for a brewery restaurant selling beers at 4.50 and 5 bucks.   Anyway, I'll certainly head by for drink or lunch from time to time. Not a chance in hell I ever order a beer of theirs again until I hear they have a new brewmaster who is capable of putting out a drinkable beverage."}
{"text":"I never had a beer at Heist that I liked.  Charlotte is full of great breweries. This is not one of them.  If you are thinking about going here for the beer please think again.  Plenty of much, much better places in NoDa  Food is very good albeit overpriced.  Ambience is also plesant"}
{"text":"Holy Shitsnacks this place is AMAZING! The only reason I gave them a 4 is that they took away the ribs that were sweet and tangy and fried and fell off the bone perfectly. The beer cheese, lamb meatballs, hummus and duck flatbread are all wonderful! I highly suggest the beer cheese. If you have more than two people, order two. The flights of beer are a great way to pair different beer with the different tapas plates and there is enough beer in each glass that you have more than just a sip or two. We bring everyone we know to heist!"}
{"text":"Drinks were good, but the food was a total DISAPPOINTMENT.   This was my second time to Heist. I came about a year ago for Easter Brunch and I enjoyed it and thought it was good value. Fast forward to July 2014- midweek dinner for two. He had a beer and enjoyed it and I had the lemonade house cocktail which was refreshing.  The food is small plates/tapas. SIDENOTE: He hates small plates and thinks it is total waste of time and money and just a scheme for restaurants to charge a lot and give a little. When he goes out to dinner, he wants a real meal and to be fed. It could not have been more true in this case. So I said we should leave immediately and head down the street to Cabo Fish Taco or Boudreaux's. It was pouring rain and rush hour so we stayed. That was our 1st mistake as we should have left when we had the chance.  The menu is interesting, but it just doesn't deliver. If you have been to Soul in Plaza Midwood, it has a similar small menu but not nearly as good. You think you are going to get something exciting delivered to your table then you get 3 morsels on a plate and are like WTH? We ordered the fried ribs, the lemoncello wings, chicken basket (nuggets wrapped in bacon, and the tator tots. I was most excited about the wings, so I ordered those first. That was Mistake #2. They were burnt. Black. And now that I am reading the reviews on here, I am the 5th person in two months to mention that their food was burnt. The tator tots- Mistake #3. I only ordered them because they didn't offer fries on the menu. The server said their would be 6-8 tots per order. THERE WERE FOUR. That's right folks, 4 stringy tator tots in a dish. Heist should be ashamed of themselves. I won't be coming back and won't recommend.  To Corrie, the Business Mgr, who is commenting on everyone's review: please tell the chef to NOT let anymore burnt food leave the kitchen (you need to implement some kind of quality control here) and add some fries to your menu."}
{"text":"Awesome tapas style food. Had some really interesting fusion of traditional pub food and contemporary tapas. We ordered 6 dishes among 3 people which was just right for dinner. I really enjoyed the pork belly corn dogs and salmon belly tacos. There was a watermelon salad served in a plastic bubble which was cool to look at, but the conttrast between the sweet watermelon and vinaigrette didn't work out for me. There was a tater tots dish as well that I thought was good but too heavy for tapas. However, I do appreciate the attempt to try out these flavors. Also, the beer was amazing. The IPAs were $5-$6. Didn't get a chance to try anything else but given how often the tap changes I would love to go again. All in all, great food for tasting with even better tasting beer, with a clean indoor setup and plenty of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a Sunday and it was AMAZING everything was good and only 20.00!!! I loved the fact that you get an entree item along with the brunch Buffett. Everything was fresh and good. This is a must go to place in Charlotte. Cool decor and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I called ahead to let them know about all my food allergies . The manager assured me it would be no problem. We arrived and they called over the GM, who in turn gave my list of issues and let the chef work his magic.  Not only did the chef personally present my food, but he, the GM and the  owner all came by to check on me ( and the rest of the  table of course). The food was outstanding, creative, full flavored and artistically presented. It was gourmet and hands down the best restaurant mean I have had since being diagnosed with my food allergies a few years ago.   The others in my group had the ribs, wings, burger sliders and homemade tater tots with their beer flights. I had the Brevardian, a refreshing mixed drink. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Would not serve us alcohol because we had temporary id's from GA as it was not laminated. The waitress spent a good 5 minutes walking around trying to avoid our table hoping we would leave. The beer cheese was good once she got around to taking our food order, the cast iron chicken wings were terrible. After having had a sad time overall we left after having had a conversation with the manager."}
{"text":"Went in on a weekday afternoon with my brother and we both had a flight.  Wonderful beer selection.  The place wasn't at all busy, so the staff took extra time to chat with us.  This was the most educational beer tasting I've had in town!  I wish I remembered the name of the pumpkin beer that we sampled.  It had the best pumpkin flavor I've ever tasted in a beer."}
{"text":"Last night we had a fine dinner and a couple of cold ones.  Heist Brewery is definitely doing something right.  The parking is ample which is not always the case in the NoDa area.  The ambience is casual, comfortable with friendly, attentive wait staff.  We tried the lamb tomahawks, caesar salad and crab 'burger'.  All items were top notch.  The lamb was tasty, but the blueberry mustard a bit too sweet for my palate.  The grilled romaine was outstanding and many thanks for not overdressing the salad.  The big hit was the crab.  Delicious, fresh bun, crab cake and a roasted tomato that actually had some flavor to it.  How do you do that when they are out of season?  Bravo.  For the beers, we tried the Brown Porter, Nut Brown Ale and the I2PA.  Hmm.  The Nut Brown Ale was a bit watery, the Brown Porter was good, but the I2PA was the best of the three.  I will watch with interest to see if they are able to improve on their beer lineup.  This place has a lot going for it.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really love Heist and I've been several times for dinner and love it. This review is about Brunch. I came yesterday with a couple of my friends for bottomless brunch. We arrived at about 12:30 and we were told it would be an hour and a half to two hour wait. I asked to be put on the list anyways. We went and got a carafe of mimosas at the bar and were called to our table in about 30 minutes...not sure why we were quoted so long but anyways, that was great! Once seated, it took almost 15 minutes before anyone came over to us to take drink orders and our a la carte orders. Once our waiter had left and we went to the buffet they were out of several things, most importantly grits and bacon and the flatbreads (all of them). These were never replenished while we were there and we went back to check several times. If you are going to charge the same price to everyone no matter what time they come and say it lasts until 2:30 than I truly feel like they need to do a better job at keeping the buffet stocked. It was disappointing and I did not feel like I got my moneys worth. I will definitely come back though and hope it's better next time."}
{"text":"BRUNCH! Yo! They go all out. Omlettes, buffet and beer. Definitely worth a visit on a Sunday. Throughout the week not so much, but today it is a well spent $20.  I will return on a Sunday."}
{"text":"We stopped here because it was a brewery that served food.  I honestly don't remember the beer that I had there, but the food was unexpectedly phenomenal.    Candied Jalapeno bacon wrapped around chicken and the nacho tots appetizer were fantastic.  Best \"bar food\" I've ever had.    Our waitress was also great.  Very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks!!! Great service and hospitality. Even the bus boys had a great attitude :)"}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place.  We came in as a group of 8 20-somethings around 6 on a Sunday.  Place was busy, cool atmosphere, and with the photos we saw on yelp thought it would be a winner.  However, 3 out of 4 items i saw via photo were either discontinued or only offered during lunch.  Not saying the \"bar style food\" was bad but disappointing for its variety and price.    Beer selection was ok, with a few chosen by our parties numerous flights as being too nasty to drink.  And that is saying a lot for our beer aficionados.    Odd note: lots of flies.  Kind of a turn off having 5 swarming around us.  Tough to control i know."}
{"text":"We came for the Sunday Brunch and it was delicious! The spinach artichoke dip was great, along with the grilled pineapple. The waffles were some of the best I had ever tasted. They are definately the reason I will return. Our server was very kind and even helped us take some family photos. The resteraunt was extremely crowded and we had to wait in line for 15 - 30 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. I am definately coming back in the near future with high hopes. I will definately recommend this spot to friends and family in the area."}
{"text":"I figured I wait until I visit this place a few more time to make sure it's consistent.   I ordered the \"BBQ BURGER\" and their seasonal Saison Dr Pin Pon pumpkin beer.  The burger hit the spot.  The burger was made with pulled pork on top of a beef Patti caramelized onions, jalapeno, pepper jack cheese and artisan lettuce.  The sweetness of the bbq pork mix with the savory season beef pattie gave it a really balance taste.  Slowly you start to taste the caramelized onions and the pepper jack cheese melts in your mouth.  Been awhile since I had a good burger and the BBQ BURGER was a good burger.  The seasonal Saison de pon pon was a good light pumpkin beer.  It's a Belgian that has a caramel sweetness and a pronounced taste of nutmeg and cinnamon.   Overall not a bad beer.  I gave this place a 4 star because of the friendly customer services , the knowledge of staff on the food that was question and making recommendations base on what I was looking for.  Nice patio outside and the inside is pretty spacious."}
{"text":"Great flat breads, wings, and lots of other \"odd\" dishes.  You can tell a lot of thought went into each dish.  Oh yeah, they have great beer too that is brewed fresh."}
{"text":"I gave Heist 3 stars, not because of the beer but rather the food. The beer was average at best, most of the samples I tried were either too sweet for my taste or watered down. The brunch buffet is amazing and really the best thing about this place. It has all you can eat brunch dishes from basic eggs to steamed oysters and grilled salmon. Check out the brunch buffet, but for good drafts look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch, is just average, nothing special. As for the selection I felt it lacked in variety...basic breakfast foods and flatbread pizzas. (Upstream set the bar high for brunch) the food wasn't cold but  could've been hotter. Previous reviews said the beer was watered down, it must be a theme w/their alcohol selections b/c the Bloody Mary was watered down as we'll, I'm not sure if it's the mix they used...have definitely had better.  The atmosphere is cool and it was packed, but just don't see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Awesome beer, incredible food. The staff is friendly and the locals are great to be around. Definitely start with the spinach dip, best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Heist? I love coming here after work and grabbing an outside table on a sunny day. Aesthetic Poppin. I have to say though I am upset about the change in the spinach artichoke dip. (can we change that back heist?) Anyway, I love their flatbread, but I personally think they overcharge for some of their menu items. Either way I love Heist and if I could go here once a week for the rest of my life I'd be okay with that."}
{"text":"Has this brewery team pulled off the ultimate Heist?? Absolutely.  I visited Heist last weekend and was thoroughly impressed by their welcoming staff, creative food, and delicious beers.  This place is truly a one-of-a-kind brewpub.  Well done George...I mean Kurt."}
{"text":"Awesome menu full of unique selections and a nice variety of beers and cocktails. The outdoor seating is very nice and has a very relaxed casual feel. Inside there are high ceilings and a more industrial feel that includes glass windows which allow patrons to see the brewery in action! Great stop in NoDa."}
{"text":"Cocktails - TERRIBLE. Much expected from a brewery, but if you're going to have a cocktail bar up front, get some bartenders that know how to make the drinks on the menu. I don't know what version of an Old Fashioned they learned to make.. But definitely wasn't an Old Fashioned, and the Texas Mule tasted like sour mix with piss. I tried to sub it out with a Cosmo, but it tasted like Windex"}
{"text":"Meh   Would I come back maybe just for the atmosphere but the food is just ok - I'm always shocked when ppl say they like their food"}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful. Party of six, three of us ordered the Succession beer. Flat, no head and it smelled like a frat house on a Sunday morning. Just bad beer. The waiter said \"Yes, it's flat. It's for people who want Bud light\". For crying out loud, it's a craft brewery. If someone wants something like Bud light they should go elsewhere. I ordered the grilled cheese and it gave me a sour stomach. Clearly, people are only going here because they think it's trendy."}
{"text":"Came highly recommended but not the greatest. Drinks are the best part, beer and cocktails. Service was friendly but definitely needed more servers. We dined in the middle of a weekday afternoon, and it was busy, however, some servers seemed to do all the work and others stood around in the back. The \"beer\" cheese is laughable. It's a cheese dip, not authentic beer cheese like they serve in Kentucky. Cuban sandwich had a unique twist but was overpowered by the mustard. Online lunch menu is larger than what is actually offered, so we felt misled. Wouldn't make the trip back to this part of Charlotte to dine here again."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience! The burgers and flatbread are pretty legit. The Rosemary tater tots are freaking amazing. The menu is not your typical bar food, which I appreciate. Everything is thoughtfully composed with an innovative, creative spin! The space itself is refreshing, open and airy with beautiful wood and a great view of the glass-enclosed brewing area. As you would expect, a pretty good beer/drink list. Had an IPA that was wonderful! Bathrooms were clean and service was quick and friendly. What more could you ask for after a late night at the theatre?"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first Heist experience. Love the ambiance. Someone mentioned in an earlier review that there's a plenty of space. Seems like they've consciously decided to keep it roomy, which I appreciate.  The food? Surprisingly good for a brewery and served in modest portions. At first, I wondered if I was going to leave hungry, but that wasn't the case. The bruschetta flatbread I ordered was the perfect size (well, that and the tastes I took of a tablemate's rosemary infused tater tots). As we waited for our food, we enjoyed the red beer. As we drank, we noted some tasty plates passing us on the way to other tables and found ourselves remarking, \"Hey, where was THAT on the menu?\" Needless to say, we are coming back to try those other items, as we enjoyed the first choices very much."}
{"text":"Went to Heist for my birthday and had a great experience. Food and service was really good. I recommend getting a flight to try several different beers if you've never been before. Tyler was our waiter and was so nice, friendly and gave great service. Ask for Tyler when you go!"}
{"text":"Heist is amazing! I came here with a group of friends and we all ordered different things, because it was nearly impossible to pick one thing. When the food came out everything looked so unique and creative. I couldn't pick a favorite, but the lobster bisque is awesome, and you can pick any of the flatbread pizzas and you will be very pleased. Aside from beer, they had homemade soda's. We got black cherry and cream, which were really, really good. Overall we had a great night and I can't wait to come back for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, served in a creative and fun presentation. I've never had anything there that I didn't like or love!   Incredible bar menu. Beers and cocktails alike. They have phenomenal limoncello on tap. Stefan is a genius at mixing up a mean cocktail.  The atmosphere is fun, upbeat, and perfect for large groups. The library bar is a bit more intimate for date nights.  I can't say enough about this place and I promise they aren't paying me. We had a flashmob event there to celebrate a dear friend's birthday and Spencer, the GM, as well as all the servers, went far above and beyond our expectations. We're so thankful for all they did to make our event special and I encourage anyone looking for a venue for a large or small gathering (work or social) to contact them to discuss. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Picked this place out on a whim...pay attention when you're driving if this is your first time here...you could miss it...It's kind of like a hole in the wall - definitely would have drove by this 'building' and not realize a restaurant was in it.  The place, at first, we thought was small, but you walk in and there's quite a nice space in the back left with tables, chairs, and the bar...it was definitely like a 'club' scene... All the chairs were high, if you know what I mean. It really wasn't a sit down kind of place...you sit, but on high bar stools...even at your table.  It's definitely a place for after hours with friends, or your spouse, but not for kids...and we made the mistake of brining ours. I felt bad for them, but they wanted to try it,so we stayed. They did have a kids menu, but you have to ask for it. It's not printed on the menu. My six year old loved the cheese pizza (flatbread). He liked that the crust was very crispy. He's not a fan of the thick, bread like crust, so Heist Brewery did a good job on that. My other kid didn't feel like there was anything he could eat. Most of the menu items were for 'sharing'...again going with the idea that you go there with a bunch of friends. So he opted not to eat...which made things more uncomfortable because we were the only people with kids, but we were there early enough 5PM on a Friday, that the place wasn't busy or crowded yet.  Ok - so more on the food. My husband ordered the burger and he said that it was nice to go to a place where they can cook a burger and he showed it to me and the meat was pink in the middle. Yuck, personally, but that's how he likes it and he loved it. For $8, it was a deal at that place. The pork belly corn dogs were good, but you only got 4 or 5 and it was $11.   I ordered the duck flatbread and it was good, but I don't think was $13 good. Don't get me wrong, I would come back to try the other stuff, and on a date night...not family night.  Also, the kids meal came with a float and my son really liked that. You can get an orange one and a cream soda one and like three other flavors.  And the beer? I didn't have any, but I think my husband had one of each and I didn't hear him complaining so I guess it was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I went for a yelp cocktails event, and enjoyed it!  It is great to have a brewery with a full cocktail thing going on.  I tried their Manhattan, and although a little sweet for my taste, it was well crafted.  Heist is a very cool space, will definitely try it again for food - the snacks they shared during the event were tasty, and there were several interesting things on the menu."}
{"text":"Ok, the beer is good maybe even a bit better than that. Problem is that you're made to feel kinda like a jerk by the security station, ..... er hostess station.  Prepare to be grilled about where you plan to sit. Want to just go sit at the bar?  Prepare to interrogated just a bit.  Anyway,  food's ok maybe, beer is good, staff is meh."}
{"text":"With all the hype surrounding this brewery/bakery/bar/hipster joint..... I am left confused on the identity of this place. The old adage \"Less-is-more\" approach is thrown out the window here.  Starters the place structurally is awesome, but the guts of the matter ie THE BEER is two-steps away from Hops Restaurant quality......no joke. The food is good but wayyy overpriced which clearly shows the consumer is absorbing the mighty cost of this operation.  Hope they can dial in the brew and stick around, but with the fickle scene in CLT we all know where this road goes."}
{"text":"I love the craft cocktails (esp when we get to chat with Stefan the bartender) and the small plates! One night they were short on staff, so despite many open tables, we had to wait a while to be seated. Otherwise, great hangout!"}
{"text":"I visited Heist Brewery for the first time this past Monday.  I was immediately impressed by the look and feel of the place- it has much more to offer (menu wise) than the other breweries in town. A friend and I had planned on staying for a few drinks and trying out some of the food, but our experience was cut short due to one very surly bartender.  She was awful. And rude. She yelled at the couple that was sitting next to us when they politely asked her to tab them out. She claimed she was busy, although the bar wasn't full. Its worth noting that everyone was ordering beer, so she wasn't 3 tickets full of craft cocktails behind.. And then she screamed about the situation to the manager RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE COUPLE, and he did nothing. I wish the beer was good enough to make me want to come back (I didn't try the food), but there are too many wonderful breweries in Charlotte with much lovlier bartenders. Terrible service can really ruin a good place."}
{"text":"We loved going here but something has changed in the past few months...the beer taste different, the burger is half the size and looks and taste more like crappy art than food. Our server forgot our beer cheese and blamed it on the cooks! Good people make a great place but seems like all the good people running this place are gone. I sent the food back and wil never go back...too bad we really liked this place. lame!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service are great. Beer is very good. Food is AMAZING. The beer cheese and duck flatbread are incredible and the chicken and waffle sushi is differ t and tasty."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is as wonderful as it is popular. Heist has a variety of food available with fresh made bread in a really large wood burning oven. The atmosphere is popular and relax; definitely a fun place to enjoy yourself and your friends."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Heist since  QCExclusive Magazine featured some of the chef's recipes. We finally went tonight with another couple, though we were nervous, after reading some of the reviews tonight before going.  i am not a beer drinker (though the vodka and ginger beer cocktail and wine were great), so I cannot attest to the beers, but all four of us were bowled over by the food and service. i had a truly difficult time deciding on what to get because everything sounded wonderful. I love to cook and my husband and I are both extremely appreciative of good, well cooked and presented food.  We were not disappointed in the least with ANYTHING and can't wait to go back.  Bryce was a perfect wait person, and the atmosphere, our dining companions, and the food made for a perfect evening.  Duck flatbread and chicken waffles were stellar."}
{"text":"The beer and food is overall pretty good, albeit pricey. Atmosphere is cool too, however I really wish they had more seating for huge gatherings. Seems like whenever I'm here it's extremely crowded. Oh well."}
{"text":"Got a champagne flight here and it was FABULOUS!! Will definitely be back. Very nice patio area and has parking which is a plus!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and i stopped by around 10 pm on a sunday night just looking for a nice place to relax and have a drink. We were so happy to find somewhere that was still open even though it was a late Sunday evening.  However, we were even more excited to have such an awesome waiter. I highly recommend Tyler as a server! He was extremely knowledgeable about all of the options on the menu and went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. Even though it was late and they were getting ready to close, he was in no hurry and had such a great attitude. I will definitely be returning and requesting him as well!"}
{"text":"A intimate brunch location with a variety of food options on the brunch buffet.   A few of my favorites: donut tower, the flatbread and the a la carte omelette!  Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Heist was underwhelming to say the least. To begin with, I was baffled by the beer menu. The font was incredibly difficult to read and part of the text and logo at the top were cut off. It looked incredibly unprofessional. I went with a flight and the beers were just OK. The San Fran (IPA) was the only one worthy of a full pint.   Now, onto the food. The menu is divided into Small Plates, Flatbreads, and Large Plates. I ordered the veggie flatbread and asked the server what Romesco sauce is. She said \"orangey.\" Um, OK. Turns out it IS in fact, orange, but tastes like a bland garlic dip. The actual bread was really good, but it was topped with heavy pieces of zucchini...too heavy to lift with the bread. I ended up mushing all the toppings together and eating it like a salad. My date ordered the steak bites off the supposed \"large plates\" section of the menu. What he got was an incredibly small plate that included two tiny steak bites (probably 2 inches a piece), a bit of potato, and some corn and snap peas that seemed to be tossed on as an afterthought. When they say \"steak bites,\" the literally mean you can finish it in two bites! It was a pitiful presentation and definitely not worth $13.   After we left we went to another restaurant to get a real dinner. I will most likely not be returning to Heist Brewery."}
{"text":"Similar experience and review as Josh J.  My wife and I ate there last Saturday night. My wife had the burger which was really good. I had the tots and fish along with a Caesar salad. The tots were very tasty but the fish was bla. This dish was comprised of 4 tots and 5 tater tot sized fish pieces.....along with sauce. That was it? VERY SMALL portion size. Then there was the Caesar salad.....using the term very lightly here. Couple of full leaves of lettuce sticking straight up, from root to wilted end....and a round cheese cracker.....for 8 dollars!  Now the server....knew nothing about the beer...said basically what could we expect with a half hour training? When we purchased two flights to taste, he could not remember which ones were which and had to stick his nose in the glass on each one to tell..that was ok with me but not my wife.  The beer......the double IPA  was really good and Krystal  was good as well and something you don't really see very often.  Given small portion sizes we went out to another restaurant to finish the meal...  Will be back In a couple of months to see if the kinks have been worked out.  Given all the hipe on facebook about the menu testing, practice type dinners I expected more.  Also, the website had no information on the menu and no pre-notification on the opening...Facebook or website."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch in the city. It has become my go to place for bringing visitors to town on Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Stood at bar forever and was not served in the order of who was next. Cider was flat. Beer good. When food arrived an hour later it was stone cold with no utensils and ketchup rationing. A shame that they were under staffed bc it is often a good place to get lunch ins Saturday."}
{"text":"Great beers, great brunch! For less than $20 you can have brunch here with anything from flatbreads to eggs. My favorite is the peach waffles. We came in with a food allergy and the chef was very understanding and created something that my friend could love!"}
{"text":"As strange as it may sound, we come here for the rosemary tater tots. Don't get me wrong, the beer is solid, too. It is, after all, a brewery. But the tater tots are crave-inducing!"}
{"text":"Wow. Definitely will be back to Heist as often as I can find an excuse!! Not only did they have a great selection of beers (I'm always so very excited to find a good stout or porter, especially during the summer months when they often disappear from menus), but the food was fantastic. Every one of our table of 5 couldn't say enough good things about the food and beer.   Service was not terrible, but seemed a little stretched and chaotic. We were called in before our table was ready, and then I received another phone call alerting me that the table was open after we'd been seated for several minutes. It took our waiter over 10 minutes to come greet us, but after that he was fairly accessible and did a great job keeping up with our orders.  So, the food. Amazing. I highly recommend these dishes we tried:  Hummus and Cheese Squeeze (Fresh veggies and hummus on a menu ia always a bonus, and the baked pretzel sticks and flat bread crackers with the goat cheese were amazingly tasty.)  1717 Corn Dogs (The root beer BBQ was the perfect complement to this unique take on corn dogs.)  Salmon Belly Tacos (Wow the salmon belly and fresh flavors of the greens were delicious, and the sticky bun taco shell rounded this dish out perfectly.)  3 Bean Not So Burger (Amazing. I can't believe this is made in a restaurant! Delicious small bean burgers on top of an amazing combo of kale and avocado vinaigrette. So satisfying and tasty.)  Black Yard Bird (These had a uniquely robust tangy/sour flavor, but the marmalade dipping sauce was the perfect balance for the bold flavor of the wings.)  Caesar Salad Egg Rolls (Yet again, a unique - and successful - take on egg rolls. Probably my favorite \"egg roll\" ever. The shells were large and fried but not oily tasting. The flavors were pronounced and delicious...all around great.)  Cheesy Mac Flatbread (My husband ordered this, and I was skeptical. Wow, was I wrong. We all agreed the flatbread was grilled perfectly and was incredibly flavorful.)  Alder Wood Smoked Salmon Bubble (Wonderful smokey flavored salmon with a delicious potato puree and mushroom cream. Three small portions, yet surprisingly satisfying.)  17 Dusted Banana Eggrolls (Woah. Hazelnut mousse made me want to cry. All around tasty goodness.)  Boozy Butterscotch Blondie (Served hot in a cast iron skillet with ice cream and warm caramelized peaches on top, this is rich and amazing to the last bite.)  Everyone in our group was able to find a beer they liked, and all the beers we tried were greatly enjoyed as well.  I just want to say \"thank you\" to Heist Brewery for caring about good food and beer...and for making Cataclysm. Once again, amazing."}
{"text":"Awful! The Little People tacos taste like dog food on a puffy shell. The Diablo something was dry, small and flavorless. After those two overly expensive dishes, we cashed out and went to another restaurant for dinner. I went to the restaurant after feeling bad for the Dining Competition loss, was very disappointed and unfortunately it was so bad I will never be back for food again. (Yes it was that bad). I hear the jerk chicken flatbread and burgers are good---if you are feeling lucky."}
{"text":"Fun night out spot with great food at a surprisingly reasonable price.  If you aren't afraid of flavor, like sharing dishes, and are in the mood for a loud fun place, then go to Heist."}
{"text":"let me start off by saying this is the only brewery in Charlotte that offers late hours, and a full menu, complete with late night options. That alone is a valuable asset to this place! My counterpart and I went one night in search of good brews and some good eats, and knew we had to try Heist after hearing so much about it. Since we were late, we ordered from the late night menu, wings and the duck flatbread. The wings had a nice smoky, grilled flavor, but I gotta say I wasn't impressed by the sauce. Extremely mild, if you're a lover of spice. Would have liked to have tried the Japanese black style with ponzu, but we were told they weren't available at that point in the evening. The duck flatbread was tasty, loved the root beer BBQ sauce, but could have standed to taste a little more duck. Next time I come, I'm going for the pork belly corn dogs, they just sound too damn good, and they must be considering that they'd sold out of them for the evening! The beers were good, but I feel that they need more time to develop their recipes, just like any new brewery. I drank at least four pints of the porter, and tasted all the others, except for the i2pa, which was not yet on tap. This is also another thing I must make a point of ordering next time. The interior is awesome, great view of brewing equipment, cool lighting in Ball mason jars, and incredibly hand laid Jenga-like wooden inlay in the walls. TVs and a patio are also nice features! The bartender, Stefan, was extremely personable and made great conversation with us. He made sure we were taken care of the entire time we were there. Oh yeah, they muddle their drinks by hand, and that is just as cool as the beer. All of the drink menu looked quite refreshing, and again, I have made a point to try one next go round. Giving it an overall 3.5 stars, simply because I need to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer and food! Their Sunday brunch is especially the best! The decor is great as well! Took my father and law here and we had a great time!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review purely on our experience using Heist as the location of our rehearsal dinner celebration.  We booked Heist Brewery 10 months before our wedding as the site of our 80 person rehearsal dinner celebration. Our options were pretty limited given the number of people we had but we thought Heist was a fun spot to gather and they had the space to accommodate us. Initially, we worked with their in house event coordinator (who has since left) who was all over place when it came to contracts, emails, planning etc. The terms of the agreement kept changing and she wouldn't respond to emails or calls - not something a bride wants to have happen close to her event. We were about ready to pull the plug on having our dinner at Heist when Chef Rob and Spencer stepped in. They quickly caught up to speed on everything that had happened and promised to repair any mistrust we had with the establishment. We decided to stick with Heist and I sure am glad we did.  Chef Rob and Spencer paid attention to every detail in the planning process through meetings and check in emails in the few months leading up to the event. Fast forward to the dinner and everything went off without a hitch. The beer was good and flowing, the special southern menu they made for us was a huge hit and their service was impeccable. They even added special touches like flowers and table tents on the tables. We are so glad that they stepped in to help us host such an amazing event.   If you are in need of a location for a big event, look no further than Heist - just make sure you work with Chef Rob and Spencer."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, the beer and plate sharing on patio seating was nice during summer time. I then went there for the much loved Sunday brunch one fall day and it wasn't amazing. Service was good, food was decent but to me it seemed overpriced for what was served. Maybe if was an off day so I'll give it one more chance but not as excited as I originally was."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place, but ended up pretty disappointed. Echoing what others have said, the beers do taste very watered down, so much so that we had a sip of each and that's it. Food wasn't memorable either, and 3/4 of it came out lukewarm/cool. The fish in the fried fish and tots was soggy and room temp. Overall, flavors weren't very good or special enough to warrant a return. It's also quite loud, I was really having to raise my voice to be heard by my dinner partner. It's a nice looking place for sure though."}
{"text":"Food is good. OVERPRICED for sure, but not bad. BUT the beer is awful. Its watery and all the beers taste the same. I had a stout, red ipa, seasonal, and wheat and COULD NOT taste the difference. I love beer and breweries and a variety of beer Heist fell way short on all of those. All and all it is not worth going back just for the food.   Atomosphere is cool. Beer cheese app was legit. DO NOT drink the beer!"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations for their brunch. Sadly it was a let down. All the food (except for the pizza) was cold. Eggs were stale, biscuits had become hard. I tried a few iterations of food figuring I had just caught the tail end of a dish but no, fresh dish of jerk chicken ravioli which was lukewarm, dry ravioli and chicken. I also had to ask my waitress for sugar for my coffee.. And then a spoon when I found her again. Simple stuff like this can get annoying quickly.The staff in general seemed pretty overworked (other than what looked to be the manager/owner who just stood there). Really this experience deserves 2 stars but I bumped it up a notch for the amazing chicken and waffle pizza. If I come back I'll update my review."}
{"text":"Good beer, better food! Great food menu with great variety of options! This is definitely not your normal pub grub! Pork belly corn dogs were a delicious spin on a great classic! Beers are good but noda and birdsong give them a better run for their money as best breweries in Clt!"}
{"text":"I have been to Heist a few times for drinks, but had dinner there for the first time last night.  The food was delicious!  Great variety and the chef was very accommodating to dietary needs.  I am vegan and I enjoyed sharing the stir fry and the veggie flatbread.  I definitely recommend Heist if you're looking for good beer AND good food."}
{"text":"If you think this place has good beer, you shouldn't judge beer ever again!  This place is horrible IMO. The food was bland and unappealing. Had a burger and tater tots which was one of my least favorite meals in recent history. Tried several beers which were equally unimpressive. I wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend to anyone. Only thing I liked about this place was the atmosphere/decor.   Cliff notes: bad food, bad beer, decent atmosphere."}
{"text":"We visit Heist quite often, as their beers are excellent.  However, a huge turnoff is that each time we visit, there are always dirty glasses left behind the bar and on tables.  It seems that rather than bus tables, the waitstaff simply hoards these items behind the bar.  A half consumed Bloody Mary stacked with a three-quarter full pint of beer isn't a very nice view if you're enjoying one of their stellar beers at the bar, or even walking into the restaurant.  A great brewery if you can look past the display of forgotten dirty drink ware."}
{"text":"Where do  I start?? oh yea..this place is AWESOME!!! My boyfriend and I were leaving NoDa where we dined at Cabo Fish Taco that evening.  On our way home we saw a sign that displayed..BREWERY! So of course, being the beer loves we are, we decided to stop in.  I am a huge fan of local brews and theres are really great.  They only had about 5 or 6 to choose from but they did have various ales, lagers, and etc to choose from.  We ate in there about 2 months ago and the food is AMAZING!! Absolutely AMAZING! The presentation of the food and the taste was perfect.  We both had a lamb burger and I am so happy to call this place one of my new favorite hidden gems in Charlotte!  I can't wait to go back.    However, a suggestion to the manager..the music inside can be a tad too loud in which makes it hard to hear dinner conversation."}
{"text":"Stopped by a couple months back,food and beer are good but no way worth what they charge. You just get nothing for your money."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch and lunch. If you're going for brunch-come hungry. The waffles are amazing. Service was alright-but they were super crowded so it wasn't big problem. Next time we'll go after 12 to enjoy the bottomless mimosas!    Pretty quiet at lunch time--tater tots are great. Decent prices for a good lunch."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!  My wife and I had a horrible experience about 2 years ago and haven't been back since. We decided to try it again with the \"infamous\" brunch buffet hoping it had changed...definitely hasn't! Where do we start... on the buffet you had overcooked sausage and undercooked bacon (the two easiest breakfast items to cook), the biscuits were rock hard (no amount of gravy can fix), and the hash browns were cold. We ordered off the a la cart menu (eggs benedict and shrimp and grits) complete disappointment! The eggs benedict was completely inedible, ice cold and disgusting! We couldn't even cut into the egg! However, the shrimp and grits were decent. We had \"endless\" waffles...what a joke!  The waffles were ice cold and weren't endless (not like we would have ordered more anyway) because we never saw our waiter again after we sat down.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!! There are better brunch restaurants in Charlotte to spend your money at. We paid $20 per person for horrible food and service. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"How's the food? I wouldn't know. I've been here now this is my 4th time for multiple reasons. The first time we sat down there was 4 of us intending to get beer and dinner. We waited for 15 min before getting service which at that time we left and told them how long we waited. They didn't seem to care. #2 was with work. They completely ignored me and I was the only girl in the group. So I left #3 was just this past Tuesday. Husband and I met up after work to grab some beer. They were dead when we arrived. We were sat at a table and ordered beer. We stayed until I guess dinner rush and at that time the waitress brought us our check and then was never seen. We wanted more beer but since she ignored us we didn't get it. So we put the credit card on the check and poof she appeared. With no questions. Now I come for a can release thinking hopefully they would be organized. They tell on social media and online that they are having a breakfast at 9 am and then can release starting at 11. Nowhere anywhere said they would be handing out tickets. Finally found out they handed out tickets at 7 am and only told a beer group that if you are a member of you would be know this information. The event is completely unorganized. Now since I haven't been in Charlotte long and not knowing about this beer group I am a very unhappy customer who is extremely loyal to those that deserve it. I have been in the beer world in a different city for the past 6 years and now in charlottes. Now I know why I don't choose to come here that often. When you treat your customers with bad service and expect to make up the money because of other people. Bad business for sure."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN the worst service I have ever received, but more on that later.  The beer was watery and flat. The NC brewing community has such great offerings, and is an embarrassment to all the good things breweries like Foothills, DuckRabbit, and Fullsteam have done.  The food was okay. A little pricy for the quality, but everything was presented in a unique way, which made the obnoxious titles almost bearable. However, one thing I will not abide by is shitty service. The hostess acted outraged that we said our party would be 6 and not 5 and acted generally snooty anytime I asked her about our wait (which somehow ballooned from 45mins to 1:15 by the addition of one extra person.) Our waitress, who's name I didn't catch because she was too busy talking shit about her other table to us, was completely flummoxed the entire night. She had our party, a 6-top of generally well behaved adults who all have worked, or currently do still work, in the service industry in some capacity and an additional 6-top of boisterous drunks. However, instead of sucking it up and smiling through the awfulness that was the other table, she broke the golden rule of serving and made her problems our problems. It took her 14 minutes to figure out our checks and ended up shouting at us about how \"difficult\" we were making things. As a former server who has done separate checks for parties of up to 30, I know it can get a little confusing. but separating for 6 people is not that difficult, especially when we were patient about what a troll she was being about her other table.   The worst part: a member of our party said that was the 4th time he'd been there and the 4th time he'd had bad service. I will NOT ever return to HB, and will not recommend it to anyone.  Addendum: this is my first review on Yelp. I've been a yelp reader for years, but the service was so bad i felt compelled to CREATE AN ACCOUNT just to bitch about it. Please save yourself some trouble. Get dinner at Cabo Fish Taco and then just get your beers from Salud."}
{"text":"I just got a take our order that was packaged with love. It said thank you and the presentation was stellar. Thanks for the awesome turkey baguette and creamed corn, and for the added smile!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised how big this place was when we walked in. At first glance there was one small dining room and a bar. But as we walked back to our table there was a huge room with a glass wall looking into the brewery as well as a second floor area.  Tonight was a \"soft opening\" so I'll have to forgive Heist for our table. We were stuck way in the back in what felt like an unfinished part of the restaurant. There were no TVs or anything, just bare walls to stare at.   We started with some chicken and waffles and pork belly corn dogs. Both were good, the chicken and waffles was my favorite. It was sweet and spicy with the syrup and peppercorn butter. A very delicious bite. Many of the menu items were missing, due to it being an impromptu opening, I believe.  We finished our meal a crab and pimento dip. It was very fishy smelling, but not bad tasting. We were looking forward to the oatmeal cookie cheesecake but there wasn't any left.  Hopefully next time.   Oh, and don't let me forget the drinks...oatmeal stout, hefferveizen, and a crystalveizen...All amazing, as were the home made sodas. You just have to come and try for yourselves.   Service was excellent. We'll be back and hopefully we will have a better table and some cheesecake next time!  For their first night I think Heist did a pretty good job. If you are dining here at peak times I'd suggest parking at the YMCA, parking is sure to be an issue for both Heist Brewery and Highland Mill Lofts residents."}
{"text":"Went in to grab lunch last Sunday only to find out it was brunch buffet only, which is fine. I was severely impressed with different type of food on the buffet and  the ability to order fresh waffles and 1 a la carte item. The price was very reasonable for all that was offered.  My wife and I wondered why there was a limited beer selection but the waitress explained to us that the last few weeks with everything going on has wiped some of the beer out with business being higher than expected. Still had a good selection and tried one of the beer mixed drinks which was good as well.   Service was good even with how busy it was."}
{"text":"Oh Heist, how disappointing the brunch has become. Success has spoiled you. We used to come often to brunch and loved all aspects of the meal, service and space.  Today the drinks were not good, thr food that was available was cold....all of it, and most of what we ate was mediocre. The first time through the line I heard the waitress tell the kitchen they were out of everything....literally. I hoped for a refill so tried a  second time through the line and  found none of the chafing dishes refilled. I came back with a chicken wing that although tasty, was served  sitting in a bowl of room temperature liquid, a limp piece of bacon and some strange tasting Brie and chocolate bar, and a cold tiny Shepard's pie. One of the best things about the brunch used to be the made to order waffles and omelets. I finally asked the waitress if they still had waffles and she said she bring some. We were served 2 small wedges and these too were served cold. After we finished eating I saw someone being served an omelet and realized this too was by request, but we were not told they were available. I've had comparable meals served at Denny's, minus the alcohol and mussels."}
{"text":"We went to Heist for the first time for a late lunch with friends on Saturday. Heist is both brewery and restaurant with a huge dining area. The restaurant has a very cool and trendy vibe. Our server must have told us a three times that Heist was \"a brewery first, a restaurant second,\" but the beer didn't really hold up to that. The food was better.  To make it easy, we shared a flight of beer. We didn't love the beers we selected and wish there had been a bit more guidance from our server when we asked.  For lunch, I had the sriracha fried chicken salad and it was huge and very good. The salad came with a tasty flatbread/ pizza slice too. My boyfriend opted for the decadent cheesy mac flatbread. His flatbread was a thin crust pizza with macaroni noodles and what was basically nacho cheese on top. I couldn't eat a full order's worth, but he didn't seem to have any trouble demolishing it. Our dining companions ordered the wings, which are huge, and a salad/ flatbread combo. They were both pleased.  We'll def be back for brunch and to give the brews another shot."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, great deck - had a fantastic time. The service was slow but it was St Patty's Day, so it got crowded quick. Love the beer cheese and the New England IPAs. Please note - the beer selection was 100% IPA so if you are not a fan of the style, you should go elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Got to try \"The Black Fog\" beer cocktail. A mix of stout beer, rye whiskey and blackberry purée... Amazing taste!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best beer in Charlotte, great food, great setting. Only complaint is the service. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it isn't. But the beer and food with the atmosphere is so good I make it a point to bring guests here."}
{"text":"Heist Brewery in NoDa has the best Sunday brunch ever. I should probably confess I have never been to a Sunday brunch so maybe my opinion is a little biased but I'm still sticking to it.  Heist Brewery is located in the historic Highland Park Manufacturing Company Mill No.3 in NoDa and is part local brewery, part restaurant, and home to one hell of a Sunday brunch. I had so much food I honestly cant remember everything I put on my plate but I remember everything being absolutely perfect. The pancakes, the omelettes, the potatoes, the everything... it was all amazing."}
{"text":"I'm from Orange County, CA. As such, I'm snobby. With that said ... HOW DOES THIS PLACE HAVE A LESS THAN FOUR STARS?! If you want to know why ... zoom all the way to the bottom where I make fun of people. Let's start from the beginning. I Yelped a place to go for dinner. I found said place. I drove to said place with my wife and four kids. I found said place and thought to myself, \"I cannot park my car within a 1 mile radius.\" Ah ... now we were finding a new place ... with parking. We found Heist. There was an actual parking lot. Apparently Heist ownership realized that they would need to accomodate these new fangled inventions called ... automobiles (or in the newest lingo ... \"cars\" ... crazy technological advancements). There were, and I'm approximating here, 8 million people at Heist (which is a lot). My wife, realizing that the situation appeared hopeless, hopped out of the car to find out how many days we would need to wait (with a 2 yr. old) to get a table. The answer came back ... we could have a table immediately. Heist was now 2 for 2. We walked into Heist and came to the sudden realization that we were officially the oldest people there (I'm 40). I officially felt cool (until I realized that it was \"official\" ... creating an ironic juxtaposition). Our waiter, Brandon, arrived. My wife and I ordered awesome drinks and then realized that the only food was bar food. Uh-oh ... I like bar food. My wife likes bar food. Do my kids like bar food? I dunno. Oh goodie, a learning experience. Brandon informed us that they had a kids menu. Learning experience averted ...  HUZZAH! Heist is 3 for 3. We all ordered our food. It arrived quick ... like 15 minutes quick. More importantly, pre-two-year-old-meltdown-from-hunger quick. Heist is 4 4 4. The food was DELICIOUS. My kids had burger sliders and flatbread pizzas. My wife and I had Mongolian Beef and Fried Cawliflower. However, my sons attempted to hijack MY Mongolian Beef. No dice foolish children. They came to the sudden realization that their lack of adventure-some-osity-ness had resulted in them receiving burgers. I mocked them ... vigorously. To our great surprise, one of the best meals was the meal ordered for the 2 yr. old. The chicken strips are hand made and CRAZY GOOD. If I had known how good I would have ordered a kids meal for myself (and still eaten all the Mongolian beef while mocking my children). Heist is now 5 for 5. AH ... ON TO DESERT! This is the only place Heist fell short. The Bread Pudding was burned ... badly. Oh well. Heist went 5 for 6. However, they did such a great job that we had to give 5 stars. Now ... let's mock some other reviews. Apparently, a decent percentage of locals are completely unpleasable. Perhaps they are under the impression they are royalty of some sort. I pity their spouses and children. Their reviews don't need to be read with a grain of salt. Their reviews just don't need to be read. That said, my apologies your highnesses if I offended your overabundant sensibilities."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for the first time in a while over Thanksgiving 2012 with family.  Had The Mazone flatbread pizza: fantastic meats and blend of cheeses, a little pricy but a very good appetizer.  The oven roasted beer cheese with handmade pretzels is absolutely amazing.  I actually stopped by here a second time before leaving town to have this appetizer a second time.  The Jerk Chicken sandwich was spectacular, especially for the price.  The sandwich was cheaper than either of the appetizers, but the smoked bacon ciabatta, with sun dried tomato pesto, and jerk seasoned chicken made one of the best sandwiches I've ever had."}
{"text":"Their brunch buffet and mimosa carafes are awesome! But I still have to take a star off for the time that they promised us brunch for my bachelorette and didn't come through..."}
{"text":"Went to Heist last night for dinner and was not expecting much from the word \"brewery\" in terms of food.  However, this place completely surprised me.  The menu doesn't really do it justice, so if you look at it online and think the menu may not be what you want, think again.  There were roughly 14 in my party and everyone's food was excellent.  The presentation is like a fancy restaurant, and the prices are cheap.  I had the crab burger with tator tots, which was really delicious.  But the banana and hazelnut chocolate egg rolls are incredible!  The beer was good, I had the Dubbel, and the service was excellent.  I highly recommend going to Heist."}
{"text":"Well I haven't been to Heist since 2015 and now I know why. If you want beer this is the place but if you are looking for decent food go elsewhere. Food is very skimpy and overpriced and to make is worst not good. Heist used to be the place for original good food but that is long gone. Quality has gone down. The only thing that's still good are the beer cheese and pretzels."}
{"text":"In the NFL they call them \"rookie of the year\", in the world of craft brewing, I don't know what you call them, but Heist Brewery is now the MF Cam Newton of this town!    I've been tracking them on Facebook back when they were still taking votes on which logo to use just six months ago, so I NEVER expected them to come out this hard. We walked in and our jaws dropped, this isn't another tasting room with a small bar, tables scattered about, and a dainty little food truck parked outside. No, no, this place is HUGE! The inside looked like some elegant warehouse handcrafted by metrosexual lumberjacks. The first thing we noticed was a full bar (yes liquor in a brewery), and above that was a chandelier covered with bullet holes like Chuck Norris just had his morning coffee and walked in to decorate the place. On the way to the table we passed two bars, an upstairs dining section, and an outdoor \"dog friendly\" patio area.  The menu descriptions had us drooling, and the food...I mean giant skewers of shrimp covered in tangy cotton candy clown wigs, Chicken and Waffles, Pork Belly Corndogs in a brewery? WTF! this place is out of control! We started with the Oven Roasted Beer Cheese and Pretzels....I literally scraped the remaining cheese up with my finger like a 3 year old, then turned around and did the same thing with the Gorgonzola dip minutes later from our Grill-Smoked hot wings. The Chicken and Waffles were unlike anything I have ever tasted, and the Root Beer BBQ sauce that came with the Pork Bellies was mouthwatering. As we scanned the menu we saw Parmesan Rosemary Tots, so we ordered a side dish of those and Holy $%*# were they incredible!!! I'd eat those straight out of Napoleon Dynamite's pockets! We finished with double desserts, the Caramelized Banana Hazelnut Egg rolls, and the Butterfinger Blondie Bite. I literally felt like slapping someone they were so good. PISSED I will never taste this Butterfinger dish in my own home, but I guess that means I'll be back soon.  Finally the beer, I mean I almost forgot this was a effin brewery. You gotta respect their dedication to the basics. You won't find some crazy rhubarb flavored beer here. I spoke to the owner, their interests were perfecting the base of beer drinking, I'm talking hefeweizen, stouts, IPAs, lagers and ales. They had several seasonal and flavored releases too, but kudos to them for coming out the door with a solid base of some of the lightest and easiest to drink beers I have ever had at a microbrewery.   We went with a combination of flights and pints to sample them all, so let me quickly break down my favorites:   (Oatmeal Stout) - Almost Samuel Smith worthy but somehow lighter (Hefeweizen) - Balls down the best I have ever tasted. Bought a Growler of this! (i2pa) - Superb India Pale Ale! I wouldn't tip a 40 of this at my own brother's funeral (Kristalweizen) - Very light and smooth no hoppy or bitter aftertaste  Seasonal favorites we tried:  (Blueberry Blonde) - Tastes like blueberries and cream oatmeal (Peach Hefeweizen) - One of the better peach brews I have ever tasted (Belgian Tripel) - Reminded me of Canada's Trois Pistoles very flavorful!  Alright real talk, there is one negative to this place. You WILL spend some cash, and the portions to cost ratio may be too much for your wallet to handle. If your visit was anything like ours though odds are the dining experience, the presentation, and the combination of flavors that come together from these creations, will still leave you with nothing but respect for what you just consumed, high price and all. We went with just the appetizers and desserts this route, but the menu is so diverse you will want to try it all.  We can't wait to head back to experience the entrees.  If you find it hard to believe just check out their food porn on Facebook, or better yet browse the menu and tell me this place doesn't make you want to go to Check-n-Cash off Tryon and blow your wad on some grub and suds before you even get paid.  Its just week ONE for Heist, and they are already the best brewery in Charlotte that serves food. This will forever be the place I bring out of towners and new friends until Heist is so well known NoDa is actually worth its current price of real estate."}
{"text":"Went to heist for their infamous Sunday brunch. Got seated pretty quickly outside and had a server come stop by with menus. My friend had called earlier that morning and they stated the brunch was $15 for the buffet and comes with a side item. However when seating was told the brunch was now $20. Before ordering we wanted to see what this brunch entailed. Walked in and the first thing I thought of was that's it? Half the items on their list were not part of this Sunday's brunch. The flatbreads were small pieces of burnt bread with little toppings. We ended up leaving and going to Zada Janes down the road and had a much better and filling breakfast at half the price."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, and this is my first Yelp review, but this needs to be said. I live nearby, and the space is amazing, but the experience is awful.  I went to Heist last night with a couple of buddies, none of which are particularly high-rent. We got there, were sat in \"the dead zone\" even though the place was half empty, and there we sat for 10 minutes while servers kept walking past us. Finally, the manager came by and asked if we had been sat by the hostess or just crept in, which would lightly justify our wait. Anyway, after we explained that the hostess did indeed sit us there, she apologized and offered the first round free. Not what I was looking for, but I'll take it.  The whole experience was horribly slow. We were there over 2 hours, just to eat dinner and have a couple of beers. We didn't have silver/napkin setups, and when we asked for napkins, the hipster with the regrettable forearm tat tossed a pile of wet naps on the table. So when we asked for real napkins on his next visit, he brought us cocktail napkins. \"Hey slugger, snap out of your 'too cool to take this seriously' act, and give us real napkins, paper towels, or something useful!\" Every beer order took 10 minutes to arrive, and our food took about 30 minutes. When we were ready to go, we sat for another 20 while our server walked by aimlessly another handful of times. And when we asked for the check, he seemed unaware of the practice of 3 people paying separately. We ok'ed splitting it 3 ways, but that was bush league. And of course, our first round wasn't comped. I didn't care, just wanted to get the hell out of there. I don't want to be hard on the guy, as I waited tables for 4 years, but this guy was just awful.  As for the beer. Weak. Flat. Watery. And it all tasted very similar. From the oatmeal stout I started with to the IPA, my three beers could have been poured from the same tap from what I could tell.  The food. The wings were seriously the best wings I have ever had at a restaurant, and the burger was great. I ordered tots on the side, and got 4. If you're too fancy to give more than real helping of tots, then you're too fancy to be a brewery. The menu is very inconsistent- tapas (chicken and waffles that look more like bacon-wrapped scallops- meh), wings, burgers, fancy personal pizzas. Either be a great burger and wing joint or be a tapas/artisan gluten-free artisan pizza spot. Pick one and do it well.  I hope they make it, but when 3 guys (who have no standards) leave your place that disappointed, well..."}
{"text":"Great spot. Good beer. Better food. The pour on the beer flights is generous, which is awesome. Love the decor and the feel of the place. It isn't really set up for sipping and socializing (standing), which was a drawback for me, since I was only there for a beer with friends and family, not a meal."}
{"text":"Is there an option for negative stars?  Obvs I know this is a brewery and I shouldn't have high expectations for food, but the Sunday brunch buffet is total garbage.   I've had better buffets at a Hampton Inn. $43 for two people for cold ass food is robbery. If you are hungry for brunch, you'll get more satisfaction out of a bowl of Cheerios."}
{"text":"Went late night and they bar tenders were AWESOME. the whiskey bar and beer bar were separated. They had bands going and there was a lot of people. I like it and can see coming back again."}
{"text":"I've been on yelp for years just as a reader but this is the first time since I've lived in Charlotte that I feel inclined to actually write a review.   I went to heist on Saturday night with a big group. We had about an hour wait, but didn't really care because there was plenty of room to hang out at one of the two bars and test out a few of the featured brews and taste the apps.  I started with the station #7 red and it was pretty good. Between my group I'm pretty sure we tried me all. I think I liked the tripel the best.   The bartenders, hostess and wait staff were super friendly even though they were really busy. The owner came out to our table and talked to us for a good ten minutes, and he was really enthusiastic about their concept.  The interior design was right up my alley; exposed brick, asymmetric wood paneling, open floor plan, huge viewing window to the brewery. Beautiful.  Now for the food: I got the brewmaster BBQ burger with the Parmesan rosemary fries and it was messy but delish. A lot of my friends tried the flatbreads which all looked great. I tried the duck flatbread and it was mouthwatering. We also tried the spinach and artichoke app with parm flatbread and it was really tasty.   The pricing was about middle of the road but I'd say very fair for the quality, flavor and creativity, not to mention the experience!   I will definitely be adding this into my heavy rotation!"}
{"text":"An overall awful experience. Our table of 6 was sat at a disfigured high-top table that should have comfortably fit 4. The bar stools in a restaurant were unacceptable. My 5-beer flight was probably only about 4 full. Each glass had about 1/4 of the beer spilled out of it onto the wooden disgusting flight-sever. My food came out 5 minutes before anyone else. One entree came out 15 minutes after everything else. The chicken and waffle sushi was cold. We sent it back. It came out cold again. Then they tried to charge us for it! Would never go back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, food, and beers.  I got the Burger, Burger, Burger (which keep in mind is 3 sliders, not just one burger) and they were delicious and cooked perfectly.  I also got a beer flight, which were 5 decent sized sampling glasses and it was only $7!  Great value for the money spent here, I would love to return.  I also had a whole Winter Is Coming beer, and that was phenomenal so I highly recommend that beer!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Heist only got me excited for my second visit.  You see, the first time I was strapped for time and only had a chance to do a quick flight which was five of their beers.  In addition, the brewery had just come off their introductory weekend and were out of several of their beers including my favorite style, the IPA.  Anyway, fast forward to this weekend and my wife and I decided to go there for lunch for her birthday.  The place is beautiful.  The wide windows to view the brewing action, tables everywhere for any style, bar stools, seats, patio, an upstairs nook, you name it.  Several bars adorn the site as well so you're always within reach of a fresh beer.  Anyway, as good as the beers are/were (I recommend the I2PA) the food is where this treat really is!  Chef Rob Masone, who came over and spoke with us for awhile, has really set this place apart.  We feasted on the Tenderloin Tips open faced sandwich on homemade bread with their soon to be world famous home made tater tots.  Also enjoyed the blackened salmon salad which the dressing was just awesome!  Chef Rob, knowing that it was my wife's birthday also brought us his chocolate pie which was simply scrumptious!    Our experience was simply wonderful and we will most certainly be back.  I think infusing a brewery with a top notch restaurant was a great idea.  I hope they keep mixing up the menu and bringing us back with new stuff to try.  The beers are great as well, the only one I really didn't like was the light lager.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Would love to give this place a higher review as I really do enjoy the food. Unfortunately the service has always been poor. Just last night after having dinner the waiter did not come by to check on our table. After not being able to order any more drinks and having finished our food, we waited for 15/20 minutes for someone to come by and to get our check. Finally I had to wave someone down to figure out where our waiter was and to get our check. We were notified that our waiter was sent to the store to pick up things they needed by the manager but no one told us or came by to check on our table.  Come here for the food just expect bad service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I call it the \"classy\" brewery. I have never had a drink there that I did not like and the staff are so cool. My favorite drink is their Black Fog (beer cocktail), it's dark and delicious. But the best thing about this place is the food, and the menu is impressive. This isn't your average giant pretzel and beer cheese menu, although I love a giant pretzel and you can get that here is well ;-). They have everything from lobster mac to duck flatbread. On my recent visit I had the Elderberry Seared Scallops on avocado mouse and Dust-banana Eggrolls for desert. The presentation was beautiful and the taste amazing. The atmosphere is very light and versitile perfect for a group of friends/coworkers or a stress free first date."}
{"text":"Husband and I were invited there for a double-date with a girlfriend of mine who was in town visiting and her beau... now this is a FAR more expensive place than we would normally go for dinner, but the other couple was choosing so we went with it. I found out in advance and went into it thinking it looked overpriced. Is that Heist's fault? I guess not. However, for what we paid, I feel like it was a total rip-off. I might not have minded one expensive night out if the food had been really stellar. It wasn't.  Now, it was lovely inside. Really cool, even hipster atmosphere and you could see into the brewery like an aquarium. The only thing I'd change are high backless stools at tall tables-- looked nice but very uncomfortable for a lingering, tapas-style meal. My husband ended up \"stealing\" me a different kind of chair from another seating area :)  I am pregnant so I wasn't drinking, but my husband ordered the darkest beer that they had (forget the name). It being a brew-pub, he had pretty high expectations for the beer, but was disappointed. It wasn't awful, but it was not memorable, so not worth the price-- and he's used to spending more for craft brews. I had water. Boo for not having anything more interesting than standard fountain drinks for non-drinkers... I understand most people will be there to drink but at least throw in a nice spicy root beer/ginger ale or house-made lemonade. There was a lemonade cocktail so I thought they'd at least have that. But the only options were Coke&Sprite.  On to the food.  At the risk of sounding pretentious I'd call the menu \"ambitious but not well-executed.\" As others have said, this is a  tapas-style place (in terms of portions, not flavors... not a lot of olives/hams/cheeses here) but the quality of the food was WAY out of proportion with the price. Everything came out at different times, which sort of encouraged us to all order something and share it with the table. However, this was awkward because most dishes came out in sets of three portions! Not good for a double date lol! Someone always got left out of trying something. Then there was the question of the bill... the guy we were meeting was clearly trying to impress his girlfriend, ordering the priciest things... lamb meatballs and lobster mac and cheese... we spent half the meal nervous that we were going to have to split the bill 50/50! So we didn't eat much of \"their\" orders, but since everything came out at different times, often it was only one thing on the table. Made it awkward and I was STARVING! Again, is this the restaurant's fault? Maybe not; but I've been to tapas places before and things came out at a much more even pace.  I got some kind of flatbread with spinach dip. It wasn't bad at all but not the best I'd ever had, and pricey. My husband got (burned) limoncello wings (btw, someone inform the bartender/chef it is spelled limoncello, not lemoncello. Sheesh). He also got some cold Ramen noodle chicken salad thing with Sriracha... it had no flavor and practically no chicken. Gross and very unsatisfying. I had a bite of the lobster mac. It was oily, the cheese was congealed, and was literally black and burned on top. I also got some kind of cheesecake bites... there was a sad, bruised, brown mint leaf on all of 3 them and they tasted like something you'd buy frozen at a grocery store. I could see clearly into the kitchen from my seat and it looked there was only one poor guy in there-- no wonder everything came out so slowly and was burned!  Final strike-- it was trivia night, which was fun but so. darn. loud. that we couldn't hear each other talk! Nobody really signed up, it seemed, so the host kind of forced everyone in the restaurant to play. It was a fun trivia contest but we were shouting across the table the whole time. Just skip this place-- we spent at least $40 for, basically, gross snacks and walked away hungry!"}
{"text":"Great brews, pretty good food but food is way overpriced.  Served in portions of tapas with a range of  $8-16, which is the price of a full meal."}
{"text":"Really great vibe, interior is warm and interesting unlike a lot of local breweries. Had the buffet style brunch which was so-so.  Everything was Luke warm but the hangover hash was pretty nommy. Highly recommend the waffles, small portions but are brought to your table and you can have as many as you'd like with the brunch. Service was good, friendly but not as quick as we wanted (we were in dire need of additional bloody Mary's) .  The beer was great but they were out of the one we really wanted to try. Bummer, but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good beer. Ashley was very friendly and upbeat. Had the Citraquench. Did not have the food - kitchen closed early. Great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is such an amazing spot. The Brunch Burger and Blurred is the Word I just had was one of the best 1-2 combos I ever had! Wow it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow, talk about a total surprise.  For the most part, I tend to think of breweries as strictly beer, not food. However, this place is the total exception. The atmosphere is great. Very open and inviting and has a fun warehouse feel to it. We sat down and were immediately given menus for both food and drink.   The drinks were good. Nothing that really stood out but still good beer that I would go back and try again (and try some of the other kinds as well). However, the food was phenomenal. They go outside the box (soup in test tubes) and have incredible flat breads. The only bummer we ran into is that they don't serve all of their menu items during lunch, which meant I didn't get to try the shrimp and cotton candy skewers (which had been hyped up to me).   Can't wait to come back to Charlotte so i can try entirely different things (especially the cotton candy)!"}
{"text":"First off, $10 bottomless mimosas for Sunday brunch, uhh yeah I'll certainly give it a shot? I'll admit this was my very first heist experience, not just with brunch, but in general. Luckily one of the people in the group that I went with was familiar with the rundown. Because if there's one thing I'd hold against them, it'd be their service. The waitress was nice enough. Although before our knowledgable friend arrived we were quite confused on how things worked. The service told us to just go down stairs after she took our drink order. Before we were able to inquire about what that meant she was gone. We found out from our friend that it was a brunch buffet. Everything made sense! Upon hearing this though we were all rather skeptical. My doubts started to wain once I saw the selection that was before me. They had everything from potatoes, to mussels, to eggs Benedict, bacon, to waffles, pizza, tarts, & even a cook to order omelette station! At $15 it's actually quite a steal if you plate wisely. Added delight was the delicious stone ground cheese grits! I will definitely be back for this brunch, & look forward to trying their dinner."}
{"text":"I give beer 4 stars.. The food 3 stars... And the service 2 stars.    It took almost 30 minutes to get an order of wiener dogs at a time when no one was inside and only three other tables were taken outside (so they weren't busy).  The beer I order also took 20 minutes to get after ordering.   The food was pretty good, but I really thought the chef went a little crazy trying to make everything unique with unusual ingredients.  Overall I don't think I would come back here."}
{"text":"Food: Wings - 3/4 types are each different and bring a unique taste. Flatbreads are popular and tasty with drinks also.  Drinks: Custom drinks, traditional drinks, variety of trendy beers - regardless your choice there is a good variety. There hef is extremely popular and apparently had sold out early that day.  Atmosphere: Cool place to hang out - patio for outdoor seating and smoking. Indoors with music and sports.  However, during the recent USC/Stanford football game (ABC's nationally televised game of the week), we asked 1 TV be switched to watch last 4 min as no TVs had it. Bartender and manager argued with us that the TV was on ABC despite the low right corner having an eye on it - it's CBS!!  You are in an NFL city, an NBA city, the heart of ACC country and don't know your local channels to display sports.. yikes!"}
{"text":"Been twice now.  Once for brunch and the other time dinner.  We been lucky with our timing cause the place gets packed.  Tried the San Diego beer and the UZL ... Very nice. I think this will be a spot to revisit again!"}
{"text":"Yow! This was barely edible! We have had Heist on our list for months and finally felt hungry when we were on that side of town.  What a tremendous let down! Service: Wasn't great, in fact it was nearly non existent.  Atmosphere: fantastic! We sat right by the brewing area and had a big table to ourselves.  The restaurant was dead aside from one other table.  Menu: Their offerings sounded really interesting but I don't eat any beef or pork and there weren't any options to substitute chicken for beef on any entrees.  Their vegetarian menu items sounded typical and uninteresting so those were immediately taken off my radar.  Food: Bland! Chicken and Waffle sushi tasted like nothing.  Chicken was insanely dry, waffles tasted like nothing, the syrup was nonexistent.  A bland overcooked nightmare.  Our jerk chicken flatbread pizza tasted like saltine crackers with burned chicken and a smattering of roasted red peppers.    I was super thankful we decided to only order a couple of things to try instead if going for a dull meal.  After this overworked, under flavored sampling we had to drown our sorrows at Amelie's.  PS-We also thought for the quality of food the prices were ridiculous.  Gotta pay for the building somehow but...Jesus!"}
{"text":"I had the steak bites with vegetables & roasted potatoes. Very delicious. My co worker got Ribs Short Ribs in a basket & he said it was the best he ever had!  Another co worker got the Burger on the flat bread. The meat tasted like hamburger helper which I was surprised. There was more bread that meat. Only giving 4 stars rather than 5 was bc the waiter brought our food out b4 salads. So our meals got cold by the time we finished our salads. Oh & our waiter was really nice but I'm sorry he had dirt under his finger nails!?"}
{"text":"I was thrilled, first the Indianapolis sports car Enduro race was on the TV, secondly the food took so long I was able to watch the full second half of the 5 hour race.  To those tables that walked out after 2 hours of waiting, you missed a great finish! You did not however, miss great food.    2 hours into our wait we were told a cook was sent home for being too drunk (he apparently didn't have the same service problem as we did, explains the bar's backup).  Fifteen minutes later they had run out of salt and sugar... Yes, all this actually did happen.    After two and a half hours of calling their bluff they finally realized that they had to serve us food.   We told her we could wait no longer, she promptly brought out food which even she was physically embarrassed to serve.  I don't know if there is a thing called hate cooking or not, but whoever was at the stove certainly didn't believe in conventional cooking practices, ie serving warm and appetizing   food.    The manger did reduce the bill by 50% (which we didn't ask for). But they never came over to apologize, which we found pretty strange.    So all in all, brunch was a fail. What we thought would be an easy, fun brunch, turned out to be more drama than it was worth.  We had cold buffet food,  not enough to drink and a lot of angst, but at least the race was on.  Next time we'll listen to the people that live in NoDa and avoid it like the plague."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to come. Their menu is always changing and it's always full of really unique dishes. I have yet to find a single dish I'm in love with. But the experience and fun of trying such new and unique things makes it worth it."}
{"text":"This brewery is nice looking and spacious inside. There are at least three distinct seating areas inside the brewery and a patio outside. Additionally, there are a few high tables near the kitchen that are a little awkward (unfortunately where we sat). We had the opportunity to try a couple of drinks while waiting for our table, Texas Mule and Blueberry Lager. The Texas Mule is made with Tito's and Heist's very own ginger beer. I enjoyed it quite a bit, albeit served in a glass mug in place of the traditional copper. The blueberry lager was a bit too sweet for me - but I could see it being a big hit in the summer. For eats, we sampled the sliders, bruschetta flatbread, duck quesadillas. The flatbread was hands down the best, with a nice balsamic glaze. The sliders turned out pretty soggy and difficult to eat, and the quesadillas are great in concept but lacked filling and taste (lots of tortilla).  The waitstaff was super attentive and personable all the way around. Really great job given how busy the place was that night. For sports fans, there is a large projection TV and plenty of viewing options. I would recommend Heist as a place to watch the games."}
{"text":"On our way home from a road trip we found Heist Brewery on a web search for top 10 Brunch Spots in Charlotte. We decided to try it as it was about a 15 min detour from our route. We really enjoyed it. Their craft beers were really good and the restaurant had a great ambiance. The brunch buffet was not that great but it was $19 including one a la Carte item so we enjoyed it. All in all we would definitely stop here for brunch again when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It doesn't happen often, but every now and then a brewery has amazing food. This is one of those breweries. We have been here several times and the beer keeps us coming back, but I would only rate it 4 stars on beer alone. Our last trip, we decided to indulge in the Duck Pizza. We are so glad we did! The duck was moist and the pizza was drizzled with a tangy barbeque sauce that worked to bring immense flavor to the dish. I am excited to return to try more of their food. The unique thing about taking their beer to go: they put it in a sealed can instead of a growler. Very convenient if you need to travel with your beer."}
{"text":"So I enjoy going to Heist for their beer but on this chance occasion (a girl's birthday) I went there for their Sunday Brunch.  Honestly, I thought it was a little mediocre at best.  I understood that they had one waitress for the inside dining area and the outside patio area but you could tell they should have probably staffed accordingly especially since it was a really sunny day and they should have expected more people to show up.  Mimosas were kind of watered down as usual.  I've been there for dinner and the place is great but this time around I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch buffet was very solid here. When you order the buffet you also are able to pick one item ala carte. We picked Texas toast eggs Benedict and French toast. Both were good.  From the buffet we had mussels, biscuits and gravy, flat bread pizza, and a few other assorted items. My favorite by far was the biscuits and gravy. The service was great and the atmosphere casual. Plenty of seating indoor and out.  For whatever reason all the food was either cool or cold, even the ala carte dishes. The coffee was warm :)"}
{"text":"Heist Brewery has some work to do. My wife and I visited yesterday, and while we were very impressed by the location -- really beautiful spot -- the dining/drinking experience itself was less than satisfactory:  1. TOO EXPENSIVE: The food is overpriced by $2-3 per plate. We don't mind paying for good food (Customshop and Five Church are favorites), but the portions and flavor profile has to justify the high cost, and they didn't for us. We felt we were helping to pay the investors back for the huge, beautifully-appointed restaurant.  2. FOOD (2.5 Stars out of 5): So, what about the food itself? The menu was impressive, and we were excited to try a number of small plates (since you can't access a menu online, we're going from memory):  ---- Beer Cheese and Warm Pretzels (4 Stars out of 5): The best thing we ate - five or six warm, long/slender pretzel bread with a piping-hot triangle of beer cheese. We'd recommend adding some salt to the pretzels and continued work on the cheese - fairly one note - but compared to everything else, satisfying enough.  ---- Ahi Tuna & Seaweed Salad (2.5 Stars out of 5): This likely would have been a four star dish, but our server noted that they were having trouble deciding whether they could do it for us, and its clear they didn't have enough tuna to serve a full portion. The way its served is as bite-size portions (with dollop of salad) on small forks situated in a unique display with seven slots. Ours came out with just five forks of tuna, and at $14, it was a crazy-small amount of food. It tasted okay - I do a better version of it myself, and with about 3oz of tuna total, we were very let down.  ---- Duck Quesadillas (1 Stars out of 5): Yikes. These were not very good at all. Very small portion with just a little smoked/prepared duck in each one. We wish we hadn't ordered this.   ---- Flatbread Pizza (2.5 Stars out of 5): So, which flatbread pizza did we order? Well, we tried to have the jerk chicken pesto, which sounded delicious. And since we were still so hungry after the first round of food (the three dishes above were so insubstantial, we had to order a pizza) we started to wolf it down when it was delivered without inspecting its ingredients. But 5 minutes later, another server came by with what looked like our pizza (\"that's right, this was supposed to have pesto!\") making us look down at what we were eating. My wife doesn't eat beef, pork or lamb, and I'm pretty sure we were eating the one with bacon. It was tasty, but my wife wasn't too thrilled with eating bacon when she's so cautious to avoid it.   3. THE BEER (2 Stars out of 5): I never understand when a brewery tries to have a dozen different beers on hand. Why? Assclown does this as well, and its a rookie mistake IMO. Find 4-5 beers you can produce well and do those only. We did a flight, and I have to say that I'd likely only order a couple again - the Peach Hefe was quite good, and likely our reason to go back.  4. THE SERVER (2.5 Stars out of 5): We were seated upstairs, and our server had to comment every time she came up about what a trek it was to walk upstairs. Well, yea, I know, but come on, don't make me feel badly for you having to wait on me. Also just too talkative -- clearly, they are still getting their act together being open for such a short amount of time. But we had 9 different people stop by our table, and obviously the flatbread pizza mix-up... I'd prefer one server, not a team.  5. Overall (2.5 Stars out of 5): I'm giving such specific notes because I want this to be a great brew pub. The backdrop is stunning, but just because it looks great doesn't mean people are going to come back if they have an uneven first visit.  Looking at the burgers and sandwiches, that appears to be how one should experience the food. And some of the beers were standouts. Work on the cost/portion size, slim down to a narrower number of high-quality beers, and make sure your servers are experienced. I started at 2 stars, but I'll upgrade to 3 stars as encouragement to keep at it."}
{"text":"I've pretty much liked most of the places in NoDa that I've been to, but this place missed the mark. I felt that the waiter was not very attentive at all. There were only 3 other people in the bar area where we were seated. Also there is a little window where you able to see into the kitchen and I noticed that the staff where eating out of this big bowl of fries with their hands. I thought that maybe that was just for the staff when their hungry or swinging by to pick up food. But clearly that is not the case it's the same bowl they serve customers out of, how gross! This was a first and last overall the food was ok."}
{"text":"Love to go here and sit outside for drinks and appetizers- especially the flat breads.  4 stars instead of 5 because one of the most recent times we went an off the clock waiter was sitting at the table next to us smoking a cigarette (wafting right onto our food) and aggressively hitting on a group of drunkenly obnoxious girls."}
{"text":"so i arrived here in Charlotte after driving up from Atlanta to see my Fiancee. so we decided to go to Heist as my Fiancee had been there for brunch which she thoroughly enjoyed. When we go there it was kind of early so the bar area was very very empty. We sat down at the bar and the bar tender Diego quickly got us menus and gave us the beer menu. I Decided to go with a flight so i could try a quick and dirty selection of there beers. We were also hungry we asked for a recommendation and were told to try the beer cheese. It was spicy and tasty and it came with homemade pretzel sticks.Apparently they have a baker come in every morning at 4am to make pretzels. we plowed through those and then i wanted to try the Bacon, it was a light tempura battered with jalapeno chunks. then they fried the bacon this may not be good for you but its awesome. So we finished our awesome snacks and then kept drinking tasty beers.In taking with the bartender apparently they do a lot of small batch stuff. So in talking to him further, he gave us a taste and it was a great new beer apparently they were actually going to be switching it to a production beer so that is awesome. it was light and very summery i could drink alot of it but the problem is 8.5 % so it will mess you up if you drink a lot. I got lucky as he had a few full pours left in the keg so i was able to enjoy that. We will definitely be returning i love beer and moving to NC from New England i need to find lots of breweries so i glad i found one so far."}
{"text":"Since this place is marketing itself as a brewery I'll go ahead and review it as such. Out of the beers they had the only one I found decent was the IPA. The rest I tried (Red, Lager and Pale) were just kind of mid range at best and nothing about them really popped. We had a question about the brewery itself and specifically what our server would recommend and he was completely clueless. It was actually kinda comical in a way. A brewery that doesn't know its beers? hmm Anyways, the inside if set up spectacularly with lots of wood and a very impressive display of the brewery section where the beers are crafted. As visually comfortable as the place is the seating is equally as uncomfortable. Our high top table seemed to be sitting on uneven ground and no matter how we tried wedging our crumpled up coaster under the leg it wouldn't right itself. Again, our server suggested that since if could be to a uneven floor there was a way to fix that, we would just have to take all of our items off the table, flip it over and adjust the screw peg on the bottom of the leg. We opted to just sit with a wobbly table. Also, if you get one of the bar stools that has no padding it gets rough on the back after a while. Sorry if this review sounds like more of a rant. I was really expecting more from this place than what it really is....A glorified restaurant. That being said. The food is great! So if you do go there, I'd recommend any of the menu items except of course the beer. Probably better off just getting a ice water."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting friends and wanted to checkout a local brewery. Locals recommended this place and it didn't disappoint! Very cool atmosphere. Sort of in the art community of Charlotte. Very good Belgium style beers, nice selection. You can buy a sampler and try 6 different ones. Service was very good! Food was very good and high quality, but the only reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is the portion size to the price. Pretty pricey for how small portions were. Other than that, excellent brewery and experience!!"}
{"text":"Everything was great. We were seated immediately, our waitress was exceptional. She was very friendly, knowledgeable, honest, and attentive. The food was extremely filling and good. The beers, specifically the NEIPAs were excellent. I can't wait to come back here the next time I'm in North Carolina"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day and will definitely be back soon. The ipa I got was great and I was really impressed with the food menu. I kept it easy this trip and went with a burger and salad which were both excellent. Service was great too.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed when ever we get food from any brewery and this place is no exception. Steak n taters were off the hook. Great little place to just hang for a couple of hours. Wish we had something like this in northern Jersey."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that I LOVE this place! Today was my 3rd time here, but forgot to write a review for the previous time. All my visits happened on a Sunday where they provide a wonderful all you can eat buffet. Line moves quickly most of the time. Don't forget mimosas too! If you are in a small group, get a carafe. More cost efficient than ordering a single glass. My favorite go to for Sunday brunch spot."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, awesome staff. I come here for the Duck Quesadilla, Beer Cheese, and of course, Stefan's phenomenal cocktails."}
{"text":"I'm from Miami and the thought of eating Chicken and Waffles never seemed appealing to me, then I went to Heist.   Not only is the place huge so I have never had to wait to be seated, I like that, but the beer selection, great decor, and food make HB even better. Not only do I have to get the chicken and waffles every time I go but now their Sunday Brunch might have become my favorite thing to do at 11am on Sundays. Their ridiculously impressive all you can eat brunch for only $15 is an amazing deal. They have make your own waffles, omelets, and a bunch of other amazing dishes to offer. Definitely a place to check out if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Great place with some great beer on tap. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere awesome."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite brewery in Charlotte since moving here. Great NE style IPA's and their blackberry sour was fantastic too. I didn't try any food but I came for the beer anyway.  Great seating outdoors and parking was easy with the large lot they have. I noticed some of the bad reviews on here were from people that didn't drink any beer. How you review a brewery without drinking the beer is beyond me."}
{"text":"Seriously not impressed by the Heist Brewery brunch. Started off on the wrong foot because they didn't have anywhere for me to change my baby's diaper in the bathroom. I asked the manager where he'd like me to change him and he took me to a dirty office upstairs. Awkward.   The waiter we had was terrible. We had a table of 8, so he must've known he was automatically getting an 18% tip and didn't care about giving us good service. The food was okay. The best thing was the waffle or the grilled pineapple."}
{"text":"Heist has been one of our favorites for awhile now. Beer is very good but the food puts it over the top! Burger Burger Burger and really any of the flatbreads and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us went for Sunday brunch and found it average.  Brunch is served buffet style for $19 with an option to order an individual item from the menu. The buffet options were nothing memorable and the individual entrees were disappointing at best. Several of our hot plates were served cold and one diner's plate never arrived at all after asking our server for it twice.  Go for the beer and atmosphere, but set your expectations low for the food."}
{"text":"This is the best brewery I have ben to in Charlotte! It has everything...GREAT beer, GREAT food (shout out props to Chef Scott), and a pet-friendly patio. I will definitely be back...and vegan or not, be sure to try the Terakihi Tofu Stir Fry....YUM! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Heist has a new brewer! The beer just got a whole lot better. Many different styles, fresh ideas, Belgian inspired but palatable for any taste. Except maybe hopheads, no IPAs as far as I can tell.  The food has gone downhill for me though. If you don't like rootbeer or candied things in your savory meal, then you'll have a hard time finding something here. If you are really hungry and have only about ten bucks to spend, you'll also have a really hard time. The food really is well prepared and creative and unusual, but prices of 12 dollars and up for tapas size portions of food are not for everyone. They have really awesome rosemary tater tots. But you better chew slowly, since they are about a dollar a tot. Burger sliders and ribs come without a side. And the actual burger and open-faced sandwiches that were decent portions are now not on the menu anymore.   Heist fills a void in Charlotte - the brewery that also offers food. But I can think of any number of places to have a better meal for the amount of money spent here, and I don't really plan to spend big when I go to a brewery. Obviously, other people feel differently, the place tends to be pretty crowded.  A word on Wednesday night trivia - not great. There is only a prize for first place (25$), not one of second and third like other places to. The questions are hardly knowable 50% of the time (How many grammy nominations did McCartney get? How much money did some random video game collection sell for and how many games were in it?) Nerdy, purely pop-culture questions. Wednesday night trivia at Revolution just down the road is a better alternative."}
{"text":"Not what we expected after reading all the great reviews and going over the menu.  Apparently they just recently changed chefs, so all the fabulous looking food in earlier posts is no longer.  Only the beer cheese remains, which was the only bright spot.  Even the beer menu was down to 5 beers.  Take a look at the current, pork-heavy menu that I am posting in pictures before you go.  Also the service was less than stellar considering we were there on a slow Tuesday. I will say the place has the potential to be a fun spot to go with a large group of friends if they can figure out a good menu and expand beer offerings."}
{"text":"In case you do not want to read my dissertation of my experience, it was the worst customer service I have ever had at any type of restaurant.   My boyfriend and I have wanted to try this place out for awhile and last night we finally had a chance to go with three other friends. We arrived around 7:30pm and were sat immediately. It was a little busy but dying down in the section we were sat in   It took a little while for the waitress to come over but once she did, she took our drink order and we probably waited 10 minutes to get it. At that point, two of our friends arrived. She told them she would give them a moment to look over the menu and then get their drink order. About 15 minutes later she shows back up. Our friends had just gone to the bar to get a beer because they were tired of waiting. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said I understand things get busy sometimes when she apologized which would be the first of at least 5 apologizes.   We placed an appetizer order of wings, pork belly corn dogs and the shrimp with cotton candy wasabi (which were really good). One appetizer took a total of 40 minutes to come out (and yes we asked if the order was put in to nicely say \"hey this is unreal how long this is taking\".   Our other friend showed up and here is where I'm surprised we didn't ask for a manager. Our friend mentioned a type of beer she likes and the waitress rolled her eyes and said we only serve our beer. Our friend said she understood that but likes X type of beer and of that what is the name of the beer here? Our other friend pointed it out and the waitress stepped back from the table crossed her arms and rolled her eyes and got an attitude when taking the drink order.   A table next to us left because the waitress NEVER came over and greeted them. She probably had four tables in her section so there is no excuse for her inability to do her job.   I could go on forever about the poor service but the kicker was once we placed our dinner order it took close to a little over an hour and my food (4 cheese flatbread) came out once everyone was almost done eating. She never checked on us after the food was delivered and we had to flag someone down to check on my food.   When we asked her about why my food was taking so long, she said \"Well, if you read the menu it says food will be brought out as it's made\" with an attitude. Rude!!  The food was good but I will be recommending to all of my friends to NEVER go here. I do suggest the manager take more time training their floor staff and make a presence on the floor. There were red flags all over the place of poor service and unacceptable behavior."}
{"text":"I came here on my bday for my first visit! Didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprise by the atmosphere. I loved it! I really enjoyed everything we ordered. Some of the flavors are a little different but it worked! My favs were the chicken & waffles and the jerk chicken flatbread. The beer cheese was tasty too. Next time I go I want to try the Himalayan shrimp sticks as someone recommended those. The one thing that didn't meet my expectation was the black cherry soda. I was really excited to try one of their homeade sodas but it wasn't great.  Overall I really like this place & will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutey, positively phenomenal beer. Light years ahead of what it was when they first opened. From super juicy dank IPA'S, to Belgians, to funky sours, they are on top of the game. Food is good but not as creative and pretty as it used to be. All in all its definitely a must-go spot if you like good food and killer beer."}
{"text":"Ok-i had initially written a bad review because of a bad Postmates experience, so I called Heist to complain. I spoke to Spencer, who then explained exactly what happened and then I knew that Postmates is the absolute worst, and that I will prolly have to marry Spencer now because he is so awesome!  Thank You!!!! I never actually got my food, but it's cool."}
{"text":"Cool place to grab drinks, beer is fresh and they have some delicious cocktails.  I wouldn't go there for dinner, but if you want something light / tapas it's not bad, just expensive."}
{"text":"I was in NODA waiting to catch a red-eye Amtrak train ride to Atlanta. While waiting I tried out Heist. They were about to close, but still served me a wonderful 10 oz. Shepard of Fire craft beer. My rating is based on that beer and the bartender that served it. The bartender was awesome and the beer was crazy good! It was a hit of delicious warm heat and warmed my entire body. Next time I am in Charlotte, I will be visiting Heist for craft beer and what I hear is great food."}
{"text":"Hmm, reading some of the reviews, I disagree with opinions on the beer. I thought the beer was really good. I agree that the food is a bit pricy and small, but delicious and interesting. The burgers are awesome. The decor is great as well. They do tend to be \"Reservation Nazis\", I have seen 50+ empty seats with reserved signs that stayed reserved for 45 minutes plus, some never filled at all. I never knew empty tables were profitable."}
{"text":"The menu had a lot of original items and the beer selection here was great. The Heist has a cool modern industrial design with enough retro throwbacks to make it unique. They have a lot of televisions so it seems like a good place to catch a game."}
{"text":"Its been a while since I\"ve visited and like what they've done with the place.  The beer cheese seems to have a little extra umph to it.  The beers seem to be a little bit more on point as well.  I happened to be walking the neighborhood when the person I was walking with suggested we stop by.  I figured, what the hell, might as well.  It was a beautiful day and they have a nice outdoor area.  It took us a second to figure out what we wanted and decided to go more for the sharing kind of thing.  THe veggie and dip tray and also the beer cheese.  It was a lot of cheese between the 2 dishes.  No complaints, just an FYI.  Everything was pretty tasty, no complaints, but that beer cheese is awesome.  We had a few beers, the double IPA being the standout.  I even was lucky enough to meet chef Scott.  Who I'm sure has had his fair share of harassment since the Diner's, Drive-in, and dives episode.  If you havn't been in a while, I suggest coming back."}
{"text":"Not great but okay however after Triple D maybe our hopes were too high.   However, the hostess station was empty and several servers past us without a word. Yet, the kicker was when we noticed that the head chef and a sous chef and server were all sitting outside next to the hostess station.   1) none of them said a word to our group of 7 about holding on or just a courtesy 2) why is the chef and his line chef outside smoking and talking during a Suinday Night service (around 7 pm)? Oh well, not my business so who am I...   The food was edible, not savory and not worth the price. While the sliders were really good (not the best sliders), the rest of the food was disappointing especially the duck confit flat bread....   The Pork Belly Tacos and Chicken n Waffle Tacos were a hit a missed.. The Pork Belly was not enough and had too many ingredients to hide the flavor of the pork belly... The chicken waffle tacos while a good idea and close to good recipe, needs some work but was the 2nd favorite dish of the night...   Can not recommend this place"}
{"text":"COOL vibe. Great location and layout. Clydes was my beer of choice. Hoppy, Crisp, and fresh. Perfect for a muggy Saturday afternoon. Three of us shared the Dips. Ehhhhhh... Could have lived without it. Good thing the beer ruled."}
{"text":"Why does this place only have 3.5 stars?  It's a GREAT vibe, man.  I'm tempted to give it 5 just to spite all of you pretentious yelpers.  But, I will admit, you get get better food just down the street."}
{"text":"Really good home brewed beers and food to go with it. Great in and outdoor areas to enjoy your friends family and feast in"}
{"text":"I think the hype over this place had set my expectations a bit too high. I went last night for dinner and as I had eaten their for lunch previously, the service was SLOW. After ordering my second beer, it took seriously all of 10-15 minutes to actually get it. I assume our server forget about ringing the beers in because another server eventually dropped them off to us at our table.   For dinner we ordered the Mazone Flatbread (with lots of italian meats and cheese), the Pretzels with Beer Cheese and the Chicken and Waffles sushi. The flatbread was tasty but in hind sight I think I would like to try a different flatbread instead. The pretzels and beer cheese were super salty and the cheese was pretty heavy. So with that combination, I wasn't impressed. The weirdest of them all was the chicken and waffles sushi roll. It came plated on a river of syrup as well as topped with a creamy white sauce. I think the dish would have been OK if it weren't for that white sauce. I actually wouldn't suggest ordering this dish. It was so strange and the flavors just didn't seem to go together.  I did try the Nutella and Banana Egg Rolls for dessert and those were pretty good but the portion size was TINY. They were like 3 baby churros served with marscapone cheese. I probably wouldn't order those again either.  So all in all, nothing jumped out at me for my first dinner experience at Heist. Maybe I just picked ALL of the wrong things to try but I guess I won't know until I come back and try other things on the menu... which I'm sure I will eventually."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks! Stephan the bar tender is knowledgeable and highly talented bar man/mixologist"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Came in for some drinks to start our night. Service was great. The 3 for $12 sliders were amazing. Will deffinitly be back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Went to Heist for their Sunday Brunch. They will only serve brunch at this time. It's a buffet only. The food was not great and the grits were some of the worst I had in my life. The majority of servers had a pretty bad attitude and were not attentive. Lots of pork on the menu but no salmon or other healthy choices. Way overpriced for what you get. Brunch is $20. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Heist is an awesome place. A little loud but it's a brewery with a rock feel. The food is awesome. Small plates, flatbread, and other items, a little pricey but worth it! I've tried the fried ribs, bacon/cheese flatbread, lamb meatballs, and the 1717 wings;all of them were really good. The best beer in my opinion is the studdy buddy and the cross-pollen nation.  Make sure to go on Sundays for the new small batch beer, a new flavor each week."}
{"text":"We got there at 10 am as soon as they opened to avoid the rush. The buffet was already stocked and ready. ( Eggs, bacon, sausage,hash browns, biscuits and gravy, multiple fresh fruits, grits, 4 direct kinds of flatbread pizzas, drunken mussels, hot wings, grilled pineapple with whipped topping, cheese, crackers and deli meat, carving station with ham, and 3 kinds of fresh pastries and 2 kinds of mini muffins.) You get one a la carte item, and endless waffles which come with the fruit of the day.   Our favorite items were the waffles, flatbread pizzas, hasbrowns, pastries. The waffles were crisp with a fresh whipped cream and caramalized pear and maple syrup. Hash browns were a cross between (what I would cal)l home fries and tater tots. They were whole cubed pieces of potato, but they were more crispy than typical home fries. Flatbreads were flavorful with both meat and veggie toppings, not overcooked. The pastries they served were mini cinnamon rolls, custard pastries and a apple filling and nut pastry. Pastries were sweet, but not dry and good size small size for buffet ( awesome, pastries and waffles were definitely the two best things). All the fruit seemed pretty fresh, already cut in smaller pieces. All the other items were good but no great. Hot wings were crisp, fairly light on the spice. Bacon was crisp, but the sausage was dry. Biscuits and gravy were a little bland. Grits were not my style, not very creamy. Didn't try the eggs, but they looked good. I am not expert when it comes to mussels, so no comment. Grilled pineapple was good.   The only reason I don't give them five stars is the a la carte items. I ordered the beer cheese biscuit ( a biscuit with country ham, over easy egg, covered in beer cheese). Biscuit was ok, country ham nice and salty, egg was cooked right, but the beer cheese was too overpowering. I thought I was going to love it, but between the salty ham and punch of the beer cheese I barely finished it. My wife got the shrimp and grits. They were not that good. Grits were seasoned, but not creamy.  Service was good, we were seated right away. Server was prompt with orders. No complaints there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte!!! Flights are definitely the way to go, beer cocktails are all surprisingly delicious. The beer cheese dip with pretzels is FRIGGIN OUT OF THIS WORLD. My boyfriend and I have actually considered each getting our own. They have a playful menu and change it up pretty regularly, which I definitely appreciate. There were two things there (out of like 15) that I wouldn't get again. 1 - the sliders (one of their menu staples, I just dont get the fuss), 2 - these blackberry limoncello wings they had last year (a miss, but I appreciated the thinking outside the box).   My only complaint is that the hostess stand is confusing. Sometimes it's outside, sometimes it's inside,and other times I never found it - then when you walk in you look like an idiot while you try to figure out where to find them."}
{"text":"The food here is GREAT. The place is loud but worth it. And best? THE BRUNCH. Go to brunch, guys. Make the effort. Get up in time and GO. Because man, is it worth it. It isn't cheap but its delicious and fun and great.   Reminder: they CANNOT serve booze until noon on Sundays. But at noon, they have drinks ready and a bell rings and it's on."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is 5 stars.  This is an awesome spot just based on the space and attention to detail with the interior design.  The first time I came here we met some folks for some drinks and I was skeptical as we walked farther and farther away from the buzz of the main NoDa area.  Once I was inside, I was glad we had walked over.  They had live music going and a great vibe overall.  The beer here isn't that great in my opinion.  I tried 3 beers and the group I was with all agreed that they tasted tame and watered down.  I tried 3 separate beers because the first 2 weren't good.  I had the IPA, Strawberry Blonde, and I can't remember the last one...big surprise.  They had to have at least 8 different beers on the menu.  I would think if they scaled down to 4~ brews, they could focus on creating a better beer.  The mixed drinks were very good however as they also have a full liquor bar.  I tasted a few of them and would recommend these over the beer.  It's kind of funny to me that their cocktails blow away their beer....and it's supposed to be a brewery!  The food we tried was overpriced and average at best.  The cheese dip for the pretzels was served luke warm even after stirring it up and it lacked flavor.  The spinach & artichoke dip was also served at the same temperature.  Ugh!  Portions were not worth $9 each.  Overall, I think it's a cool spot.  It just opened recently and I think it has a lot of potential.  We'll see."}
{"text":"Let me make this clear, the beer cheese deserves 5 stars. I will undoubtedly return here just to eat the beer cheese. It is better than anywhere I've ever been. Hands down.  With that said I just don't really understand this place. It has a very low-key vibe, awesome atmosphere, outdoor seating, good live music, decent beer...  I will say that the beer has much improved since their first few months, but the food is just too over the top. Is it necessary to serve soup in test tubes? No. Is it necessary to serve hummus and goat cheese in toothpaste tubes? No.   By the way, the hummus and goat cheese tubes squirt out the back and in your face (even if you squeeze from the bottom). The presentation is just unnecessary, especially for a place that comes off as being low-key. I suppose it makes for good table conversation, though.  In general, food is overpriced and mediocre. The descriptions are so bombastic and convoluted you literally have no idea what you're getting until it's sitting in front of you.  I want to like this place, I really do, but it's just too much. End rant."}
{"text":"Very cool brewery! There is a ton of seating inside and some seating outside. They serve food here, which is a big plus for a brewery in my opinion. We came here for lunch and our meal was very tasty. Beers offer a creative mix of flavors and names."}
{"text":"The beer was only okay and the selection was very small. Atmosphere was good, but service was average.  The beer cheese/pretzel app was basically pure salt...  Too much to handle.."}
{"text":"Went to Heist on Mother's Day. Our reservation made Monday was no where to be found Sunday. They found seating for us in a pretty short time considering it was Mother's Day. I was a bit disappointed that the only thing they offered at 1:00 in the afternoon was the brunch buffet. I personally decided to wait till 2:00 to order from the lunch menu. I order the pretzels and beer cheese. It was excellent. I ordered the Lamb meatballs and really enjoyed them. My guest had the brunch and were very happy with there choice. The others waited with me and ordered the flat breads. They enjoyed them. Service was up to expectations considering the crowd. I will return to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Totally the best ever!!! Full menu, awesome killer beer list! In and outdoor seating- prices are great! Parking isn't too bad if you are here after peak traffic hours. Staff is so nice and the atmosphere is spot on! Gotta love the Noda district! The music at this place really takes me back! Very chill, casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review to stress my disappointment with how much worse this place was (July 2016) compared with the last couple times I've been there. I don't know what has happened, but it's just sad. They serve Moscow Mule's in plastic cups, really clueless!?!. On the bright side the Pimento cheese dip with pretzels was pretty good, yay! 1 star. Won't go back, bye bye..."}
{"text":"Visiting NC and looked up this spot. This is a must visit place. Tyler and Erin our severs were fabulous very and the drinks beer and NC rum was wonderful. You should stop by and try the oriental wings, burger burger sliders, flat bread pizza thw buffulo chicken and the duck (woild have never eaten duck but tried it and it was great) Not a fan of the Mongolian beef but the bread pudding was a nice was to end the evening. Go and bring a friend. I will be back when I come to town again."}
{"text":"Meh... extremely disappointed with my lunch at Heist. The menu sounded great and the choices all sounded so good it was hard to choose. My friend and I both got the BLTC and we were both disappointed. The presentation is nice but the taste was not. First, they failed to mention the bread was full of whole peppercorns. It was way too strong eating multiple whole peppercorns in each bite. It completely overpowered the taste. Secondly, I LOVE Gorgonzola but they put way too much on the sandwich making it way too salty. The Tu Bock Shakur was great. Patio setting was awesome. Service was not so great. I will be back for the beer and hopefully the next menu item I try won't be as extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"So our first visit here happened to be for Sunday brunch. It would be a  good idea to get here early because the wait can be an hour or more. Buffet is $15 and we could not say no to bottomless mimosas for $10. The food was arranged nicely, but it would help to have some/the items labeled. Belgian waffles were delicious. The flavor is lightly sweet and airy. Me likey :). The omelet station is on point, plus they offer egg whites. :) The bread pudding was a hit on the first round, but the next batch seemed rushed/too soggy. Not a lot of variety, but it is tasty and you leave satisfied. We plan to return and try their other menu items as the regular menu is available at 5p on Sundays."}
{"text":"First time in charlotte and found this place. I had the lobster mac n cheese. It was good and just good.  The waitress was nice and helpful and recommended a few places to find souvenirs and other brews since I am not from north carolina.  The corn was very juicy and buttery. Boyfriend got the beer there and he loved it."}
{"text":"Upon my visit to Heist Brewery, I expected a casual vibe as it is in NoDa.  I was wrong.  Everyone was in a hurry and there was a 45min. wait.  This isn't a problem especially on a Saturday night for this area. No, what was the problem was the elitist attitude from the staff.      Upon asking for the beer list ,which gave no description, the waitress seemed like she had much better things to do.  The beer was ok, nothing to praise but my problem was mostly with the food.    I ordered the Bacon Cheese Burger plain and well-done (call me crazy but I don't like a side of E.Coli with my meat) and the Rosemary Tots.  My friends ordered the 4 Cheese Flatbread pizza.  Naturally, my burger came to the table medium and had a ton of the toppings that I didn't want.  From what I ate, it was ok but the Tots were just shredded lumps of fried cheese with very little \"tot\".  On the other hand, the Pizza which was delicious at the time, was a fried thin crisp of cheese.    After about 1.5hrs. the mood went from a bustling restaurant to a dance club.  The DJ started blasting the house music so loud that it literally cleared the place.  All in all, from the snootiness of the staff to the overpriced food, I probably wont' be back unless it's to drink only and even then.....there's better places"}
{"text":"Great location, food was comfortable, though not a large selection. Being a buffet, I was underwhelmed by the array of food. Service was standard, no bells and whistles. An all around comfortable spot for brunch."}
{"text":"They do a great job sticking with a theme.  Beers are excellent and the food is right there, too.  It has been busy every time I have been, and with good reason!"}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week.  I had to talk my BF into going.  He had reservations about the food but I thought the menu sounded great.  I have egg on my face because the food was disappointing.  I got the steak option and it was very thin.  The sauce had a good taste but the steak was dry due to its size.  My BF got the mahi mahi , it was overcooked and dry.  Our chocolate dessert just tasted burnt.   The beer was so-so.   The bright spot was our server. He had a great personality and was very attentive.    It seems to me that restaurant week is a time to showcase and win people over - not to serve paper thin, overcooked steak smothered in a tasty sauce."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. The only positives we found were accessible parking in NoDa and neatly designed restrooms.  The beer was meh. Everything is incredibly heavy on the bitter part of the pallet, and I say that having done a flight. The hops dusted wings were probably the most unappetizing chicken wing I've ever had. To make them even remotely tolerable, I had to douse them in sauce, and even then the bitter breading made me gag. The beer cheese was grainy, the fried ribs were like jerky on a bone, and the sausage had no flavor. To top that all off, service was slow, and we had to walk around to find a host to seat us. Normally I try a place at least 3 times before reviewing, but I can't stomach the thought of returning. I'm not the type of person who enjoys writing bad reviews because I'm highly aware that they are read by those who care about their business. That being said, I hope this sparks a review of the front of house and kitchen."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with their brunch. They only have a buffet and but offed \"bite size snacks\" with it. These bites were tiny and not better quality than the buffet food. Alot of random food in the buffet as well (eggs mussels pepperoni pizza) Main reason we went was for the mimosas deal but after a carafe  to myself I'm pretty sure it was all oj. The buffet and carafe ended up costing 40 for just myself. Could get a much better meal for that. I might try for dinner or lunch but not waste my money on their brunch."}
{"text":"Really great food and beers! We had the guacamole, hummus, and cheese board. All were excellent."}
{"text":"Interior and atmosphere are really nice and the food tasted good. But the service was spotty with our waiter disappearing for long stretches.  Also the food portions were pretty small, even by tapas standards. You would need 3 of them per person to be full and I don't even have a really big appetite. Beer was OK but a little underwhelming. I would meet people there for a beer again, but not for dinner. If you want small plate food, go to Good Food on Montford or even Dandelion Market before coming here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drink. This is a cool little brewery in a cool little location. Who can complain? I was tickled that, the night I swung by, they were low on their own beers, so they opted to serve some beer by their neighbors (and competitors)! I really enjoyed my meal and my beer, and so did everyone else at my table. Color me surprised that a brewery would have such good food!"}
{"text":"Our schedule worked out well last Saturday, so the wife and I could make it for Heist's second night being open.  I saw some pictures of their food options on facebook and they looked great.  Heist is located in NoDa just next to the YMCA.  They have a parking lot, which is always a plus in this area.  The place is huge, so it was not too long for us to be seated even without a reservation on a Saturday night.  We opted to sit at a small side bar deep inside the restaurant next to the beer brewing area.  They have 8 to 10 beers on tap (made on site) and I figured that we would get great service at the bar.  I was right about the service being great, but the beer for me was a little bit lacking.  My wife enjoyed her Tripel, but I am not a fan of this style.  The best beer that I had on this night was their Oatmeal Stout by far followed by the I2PA.  The others that I tasted (they do offer tasters if you don't know what you want) or drank were ok at best.  I always have to add that I am a self proclaimed beer snob.  I look forward to them working on getting a stellar beer line up top to bottom.  Now onto the food, which is for me the best thing about Heist.  First thing that I ordered, they were out of due to the massive crowds on the first night.  So no veal cheek flatbread or veal cheek appetizer, but we quickly ordered the pork belly flatbread called the Mazone and followed it with a smoked salmon appetizer.  The flatbread had the nice char from the wood fired oven and all the toppings blended well together.  It was a little greasy due to the fattiness of the combined toppings, as the wife noted, but very filling.  The pipe smoked salmon was just about the best food item that I can remember having in recent memory.  The in house smoked salmon with sushi grade fish gave the perfect smoke flavor that you just need to try, because no description here will do it justice.  The last thing that we ordered was the torched diablo's, which is a chicken appetizer, but these were a great disappointment compared to all other food that we saw or ate.  I would not order these again.  They did not taste bad, but there is too much good stuff on the menu as far as my palate is concerned.  One last thing to say for the non beer lovers, they do have a full bar with some great bourbon options and also some wines by the glass I believe, but can't say for sure about the wine.  We shall return on future visits to NoDa."}
{"text":"Did a Noda brewery bar crawl one day with friends....and started at Heist for lunch and drinks. We got the duck flatbread with root beer BBQ sauce and the pork belly corn dogs. Both were super savory. The pork belly in the corn dogs was nice and juicy...combo that with one of their great beers and you are a happy person. My friend got some of the chicken wings, which were ok, didn't get much meat from them. Tried a sampler of beers. My favorites were the hefeweizen and the amber ale. Next time I go I want to try some of the specialty cocktails.   Nice atmosphere on the inside, but get there a little early because the place fills up fast. We also came to heist for the roaming dinner Relish Carolina and got some awesome cocktails from the bar manager who was super friendly and creative with his drinks. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"Heist is the only brewery in Noda with a dine in restaurant, so regadless it is always a \"must\" when hopping between bars/breweries in the area. However; I'm only in \"like\" with the establishment. The beer is fine, but there are other, better breweries in the area. They all have a similar flavor, and they don't seem to have any good unique flavors yet. Also, I'd love to see more vegetarian or vegan options on the menu. Right now I'm stuck only eating the beer cheese, since they keep removing the veggie options from the menu.   With that being said, I'll still continue to be a regular at this establishment. The beer cheese is honesty amazing, the atmosphere is fun and relaxed, and although there are better beers in the area, Heist beers are still good. I've always had a great time at Heist."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe they are as new as they are because they seem to have a firm hold of who they are.  Everything flows and contributes to the loungey cool, made with love atmosphere.  The employees are fantastic and passionate about what they do, from the homemade sodas, beers, and fancy delicious foods.    I have to admit, none of the beers were too impressive, but I'm hoping they'll get better with time.  I know they are a \"brewery\", but what I really love is the food and the people.  That's what will keep me coming back.  Kind of like how I never buy pancakes at IHOP but love everything else lol."}
{"text":"Crazy Sexy Cool.  Visited Heist after a concert at the close by Neighborhood Theatre and had a smattering of their shared plates and beer sampling among a group of four of us.  Their sample is great!  You can get five beers of your choice for $6, and for someone like me, that's plenty enough!  I am girly when it comes to drinks so I enjoy the more fruity than hoppy or dark beers so their raspberry porter and strawberry blonde varieties were right up my alley.  The server gave us the awesome suggestion to mix the two, yum!  Their tapas style food was perfect for picking at and eating while chatting with friends.  Their waffles & chicken sushi was delish!  The service was really great and we were able to get seats quickly and attentively on a Saturday night.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dion L., Simone M., & I went to Heist Brewery for lunch about 12:30 PM on a Monday.  While there weren't many patrons in there, there was a large group of Johnson & Wales students on a \"field trip\".  First off, the decor is gorgeous, not to mention the \"brew\" area, which is encased in glass, but you're able to see it in all it's glory.  While I don't drink beer, I can appreciate the process that goes in to making all these crafty, special beers.   Their lunch menu is somewhat limited, naturally, however, all three of us were able to find something.  I chose the BLTC, which is a spin on the traditional BLT.  What they don't tell you on the menu, is you get a choice of bread. I went with the mushroom focaccia. For my side, I chose the rosemary-parmesan tater tots. I was happy with the price of $8 for my meal.  We didn't wait too long for our food to arrive & presentation was lovely.  Our sandwiches  were served somewhat open-faced & the toppings were neatly placed on the sandwich.  They were served on a nice wooden slab, with a small ceramic bowl (that fits into slab) for the side.  Temperature-wise, everything was perfect.  Taste-wise, my sandwich was delicious! The bacon was nicely crisp, the lettuce & smoked 'maters were fresh, & the gorgonzola cheese was flavorful. The bread was soft on the inside & had that nice hardness on the top. I mean after all it is focaccia bread. The tots were a bid odd to me, they looked more like hushpuppies than tater tots. While I was expecting your regular looking tater tots, I also expected the rosemary & parmesan to be dusted on top.  This was not the case...the \"seasonings\" are actually inside - which, the inside tasted like a mixture of  \"regular tater tot taste\"  & a baked potato.  Our waitress was fantastic...she offered selections, was friendly, efficient, & checked on us frequently. They all have on fancy black uniforms, but they weren't too uptight looking.  We also had dessert, which could be shared.  Dion chose the caramelized banana & hazelnut mousse egg rolls, which at $8, we expected a bit more. When this treat came out, it was in a small square bowl, with four tiny, tiny egg rolls.  They were tasty, though, but they could have been bigger.  The mousse was decadent, as well.  Over all, I'm pleased with this experience."}
{"text":"Found this spot while on a day visit to Charlotte and liked it with a few minor reservations. We were seated immediately on a rainy Wednesday evening about 5:30. Service was attentive and pleasant. This is a brewery/full bar spot with a limited but inventive menu. Beer selections leaned heavily towards IPA's (I'm fine with that). Our only nitpicks were that all the tables appear to be hightops - just not our favorite and the place is loud. Probably due to all the hard surfaces and cavernous space. We'd go back if we were locals - check it our."}
{"text":"After much anticipation, Heist has finally opened their glorious doors to the culinarily savvy of NoDa and beer-craving crowd of the greater Charlotte population. You wouldn't suspect much out of this old mill turned bar, turned animal hospital, turned brewery, but the decor, service, adventurously ridiculous menu, brews, house-made sodas and potential will make you turn your head more than once.   First, the decor alone will cause your jaw to drop. The layered wood lining the walls is just outstanding. The pattern it creates draws your eye to being the first thing you see. The main entrance houses a full bar and the booth seating has a gorgeous high back of finished wood. Looks like a dark cherry. Absolutely gorgeous. The chandelier is made of the extra brass pipes from the brewing gear with bullet holes blasted through them! So rad. You can bet that'll show up on pinterest soon....  Service is incredible. There are so many different places to sit -- outside deck, upstairs, main room, tap room -- and the servers ring it up and send it fast. Three different bars to order from, too.   We ordered the i2PA and the red ale. Both are solid choices. i2PA is by and large my favorite off of the menu thus far. The oatmeal stout is is one of the better choices, too. Next time we're in, we'll have to order a few flights to check out the rest of the lineup. Blueberry Blonde? Sounds crazy interesting!  The menu is just.....insane. Not only from a perspective of fusion, presentation, and taste, but the story behind each menu item. Each item has it's own little quirk and style.  We started with the pretzels and spinach artichoke dip. The presentation of both is stupendous. Pretzels were a little on the firm side, but the beer cheese made up for it. Very nice flavor on the cheese. The spinach artichoke dip was lovely. Served with a flatbread of sorts, and housing huge chunky artichoke hearts. This didn't last long as we scraped every inch of the bowl. Would order both again in a heartbeat.    I ordered the Brewmaster burger. A mix of porterhouse and brisket. What? Who in the history of burger-dom has mixed porterhouse and brisket?! It was incredible. Served on brioche, the few standard burger accoutrement, and rosemary tots. These jokers are 2oz tots. Creamy, savory and chewy. The smokiness of the burger was to die for. It wasn't overt, but just subtle enough to inhabit my palate throughout the meal.   My wife ordered the veggie sandwich. All smokey, grilled veggies on focaccia. A rather hearty sandwich. She ordered the creamed corn with it. Man. Talk about rib-sticking corn! Very creamy and huge corn flavor.   We ended up ordering dessert as well. We had to sample one of the house made sodas! Went with the orange creamsicle float and the blondie. Both were knockouts. The house-made orange soda was incredible. I can't wait to check out the rest of the lineup. The blondie was just as it should have been. Warm, topped with ice cream, and plenty of rum-infused caramel. What a nice cap to the meal.   Heist may still be new, but they are showcasing some serious talent all around. These guys hit every sense and beckon for you to dive deeper into the complex menu, both beer and food. These guys will grow and continue to show Charlotte something it has never had before.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Heist!"}
{"text":"Their brunch is one of the best in CLt. Bring your serious appetite though, a buffet with EVERYTHING you could imagine AND you get an additional side item. Their regular food always exceeds expectations too. Honestly I like it more then any of their beers"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch and I'm super happy he took me here.  Note: as someone who doesn't live in CLT, I was a bit curious about Charlotte's brunch scene. But I really thought this was a well thought out brunch menu, wonderful service, and ample space to  boot!  It is buffet style and my assumption is that the offerings rotate, so they have the 'selections' listed on the menu they hand you. Included in the brunch buffet is 1 specialty item. We got the french toast and the huevos rancheros as our specialty items, and then hit the buffet to our hearts desires. Can't speak for bae, but my french toast was great.  The food is on the heavy side -- that is, carbs galore. I felt comfortable indulging, but if you're looking for something healthy-ish....I'd probably go someplace else.  Really casual spot to go with friends, partners, parents in from out of town. The ambiance is conducive to any number of people dynamics.   They also have beer on tap (duh its a brewery) and I enjoyed their IPA selection. I had the \"You Bitter Bro\" IPA -- 7% y'all -- and it did not disappoint.   For those who want a breakfast drink: - Mimosas and bloody mary's were $5 a pop - \"manmosas\" (eyeroll) were $8 - Specialty breakfast cocktails - $8 i think?  Overall, really fun time. But I'd prob recommend doing brunch and getting a beer on tap in lieu of a sweeter drink.  Additionally, the french toast comes with caramel drizzle and waffles come w/ raspberry puree -- both, while nice additions, are too sweet for me personally. So definitely ask your server about the sauces they add onto the food before you order for awareness."}
{"text":"Went in Tuesday to grab dinner! It seemed so small from the outside but was actually a huge space.   I order the sanctify beer and loved it. Not too hoppy and very drinkable. We got the cheese board, lobster Mac and cheese, duck gnocchi, and the toast plate.   The only one I wouldn't get again and didn't stand up to what I thought it would be was the lobster Mac and cheese. It wasn't super cheese so I was a little bummed, especially because I saw it on their Instagram earlier that day and that was the whole reason I wanted to go here.   Other wise the vibe was cool and they were just about to start trivia so if's that's your thing go on a Tuesday night!"}
{"text":"Second time I've been here. Now I remember why. It's easy to say the beer is good, because almost all beer is good. However- the beer here is divine! I am a true fan of the Cross-Pollen Nation. It's a fantastic stout based beer. Lighter than an imperial, but with flavors of coffee and fig. Smoked salmon bubbles.... That is all. My date had the baked lobster and scallop cavatapi... Essentially very rich lobster mac and cheese. Fantastic! Tyler, our server, rocks my socks.  Check it out. Going back to my date now!"}
{"text":"I'm going to say this in the nicest way possible. Heist needs to step up their game. I have been there twice: once for dinner and once as part of an event. I won't deny that the food is pretty tasty. I really enjoyed the Gnome salad and veggie flatbread that we had for dinner. The tuna appetizer was less impressive but still good. The second time back we tried the beer cheese & pretzels which also fell squarely in the OK category.   There is no nice way to say that for a brewery, particularly one within walking distance of 2 other breweries, at least 3 other restaurants that specialize in craft beer, and a bottle shop, Heist's beer just isn't that good. Over dinner we tried that full range of what they had on which amounted to 2 full flights. The oatmeal stout and double IPA were the only 2 that caught my attention.  The service was not bad but to host a beer event and only have one ill-prepared bartender serving upwards of 50 people is asking for trouble. All in all, there is a lot of potential in Heist, but CLT is not the town to rest on potential in the brewery industry."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food, but don't come hungry, you'll be disappointed. I ordered what I thought was a burger and assumed fries would come with it, but instead I got 3 sliders, and that's it."}
{"text":"Tried Heist again with lowered expectations for the beer.  I ordered the Dubbel and was better than I expected but it wasn't great.  The beer wasn't as watered down as my last visit but there is still room for improvement. We tried the beer cheese (which is still amazing), the chicken & waffles, the flavors worked well together (but I could have done with a reduced amount of the peppercorn butter), and the pork belly corn dogs which I thought were good but nothing amazing.  We'll probably try Heist again in another month or two."}
{"text":"These women were rude when asking questions. They were talking to guests rudely. Could've been a long day for them but still no reason to be rude. No wonder heist business is declining. sad! The girl on the right is also eating when she should be helping guests"}
{"text":"I've waited a week to leave this review because I wanted some time to cool down from the experience.  The \"Good\": The only redeeming thing about my experience was the cucumber cocktail. I don't remember what it is called, but I would highly recommend it. It was somewhere between $12-14. The \"Bad\": Service - Terrible. The hostess was sitting there talking to someone on speakerphone and sucking down a to-go drink and munching on food with her fingers out of a to-go box. Once we got our food (I'll go into food later), the server disappeared. We sat there finished with our meal for 20min. My boyfriend had to get up and go and find him. He was just sitting there chatting with the kitchen staff. Also, the hostess TOTALLY saw us looking around for our server. She looked at us, looked the other direction, sucked down some of her drink and looked at us again, then looked back down at her phone. She did nothing. I seriously can't get over her attitude and disgusting sucking of that straw! We were also going to order another drink. But since it took so long to get service, we didn't want to stay there any longer.  Food -  I heard good things about the food. We were not impressed. It was actually pretty bad. Our server suggested the sliders, so we ordered those. They were so so very dry. The buns were stale and it was just gross. We also ordered the nachos with beer cheese. I didn't like it at all. But my boyfriend thought it was alright, and definitely better than the sliders. Definitely not worth the money. Beer - They don't have many selections of their own brews. The brew my boyfriend got was not impressive.  OVERALL: I would only suggest going here for cocktails."}
{"text":"The good news-- they have a great patio, usually have live music and is it somewhat of a fun place to have a few beers. THE BAD NEWS- the beer menu is normally only 50% available, the food isn't horrible in taste but price per portion isn't their strong suit. Also cross your fingers they're staffed properly or every step of the process is going to drag out(2/3 visits have been this way). we recommend the spinach dip"}
{"text":"Heist USED TO have an amazing Sunday buffet.  The meringue waffles were the best things ever.  However, as of my last visit the buffet was pedestrian, similar to something you would have at a 2.5 star hotel.  The only redeeming feature was the specialty item that you can pick from, but still miss the amazing waffles of past years.   Although the breakfast buffet was no longer to the same high quality standards the price was still high at $19 per person.  On the plus side you don't have to wait until noon for alcohol any more.  If you want a good breakfast go to Metro Diner and skip the Heist Brunch.  Hopefully the normal menu at Heist has not suffered like the brunch buffet has, because in the past the food has always been better than the beer."}
{"text":"After accidentally dining at Benny Pennello's, we made our way here; we sat at the bar and my mom started out with a flight, and I was looking for a cider which sadly they didn't have so I got the closest thing to it and then a Long Island iced tea.  My mom liked all the beers from her flight and my cider-esque beer was okay, not as sweet and fruity as I'd hoped for. The Long Island was great.  We ordered some toasted/ over fried brussel sprouts, which I wasn't a fan of, but I've never been a fan of those.   I ordered the banana pudding cup, which was smaller than I imagined for the price point (~$5) it tasted okay, I'm just used to my grandma's homemade"}
{"text":"You had me at Brewery...  I like the warehouse-lodge-loft feel thingy they got going on.  There's plenty of high-top tables in the main eating area. Tables are a little wobbly tho.  If the high-top tables aren't your style, they have a decent amount of bar space at each of their two bars (there's another bar in the back).   There are just enough flat screens (4-6) with the games and ESPN news on that you're definitely NOT stepping into a sports black-hole.  The one time I went here, I got one of their burgers - The Brewmaster BBQ burger.  If heaven had a taste, it would would taste like this Brewmaster BBQ burger.  The bacon, the onions, the gooey pepper-jack cheese - Magnific! I ordered it medium-rare, and it was cooked perfectly.  The tots were amazing as well - very crunchy, tasted made to order.  The burger alone has me wanting to come back to Heist - def worth the $9 it cost.     No review would be complete without mention of the beers.  I mean its a brewery, so they have anything a beer lover could ask for from IPAs, to Ales, to Oatmeals.  Its all up to you - I am a fan of the Red Ale.   Heist is here to stay folks.  The food's good.  The beer's good. The service is good.  They have their own parking lot.  NODA just stepped its game up - Heist, NODA thanks you.  Keep it up and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Heist, you only get 2 stars because you have the word 'brewery' in your name.  Had this place simply been called Heist and served craft brews from all over Charlotte I would give it 4 stars.  That isn't the case though, and the beer is, simply put, not good.  The service was okay, the food was really good...although the tots are actually more like potato pancakes. The decor is great, but I keep going back to the fact that the word brewery is in the name...you can't be a brewery in Charlotte, with NoDa and Birdsong just down the street, and serve sub-par brews."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte NC today. My wife and I had planned on visiting Heist Brewery for quite a while. We arrived at Heist at 1:30 in the afternoon. Parked and went inside. At the host stand we were we're told that brunch was being served. As this was Sunday afternoon it was perfectly understandable. We were shown the brunch menu and were told that the regular menu would be available at 2:30. My wife and I weren't interested in any of the offerings on the brunch menu. We indicated this to one of two hostesses  who were seating people. She took my name and phone number to text us when we could be seated. We said that we would return in 45 minutes as that would have brought us back just  before the regular menu service was offered Just prior to our return at 2:15 I received a text message that we could be seated. When returning to the host station my wife and I were informed that a limited menu was being offered and that the regular menu wouldn't be available until 4:30. Not being able to wait 2 1/4 hours we left, quite disappointed I might add.  To me, in all of my restaurant experience this is an example of very poor management.  The only reason I gave a one star rating was, well I can't rate it as I didn't eat there and the only way to write this review is to give a rating."}
{"text":"My first experience with Heist was ok. Food was good, but the portions were a little small for the price. The beer was not as good as some of the other local breweries in the neighborhood, but wanted to try it again -maybe it was an off night. My second experience was worse. They ran out of several kinds of beer we asked for(even though they were still featured on the beer menu) and the bartender -who was more interested in cleaning up her bar at 8pm on a Monday night - acted annoyed we asked for them.  When we finally got a table -there was a wait on a Monday night - we noticed the portions of food we ordered were even smaller than before.  Won't be going back, regardless how close it is.  All and all....if I want food and good beer, I'm jumping on my bike and going to Pint Cental in Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch, I was impressed with their unique selections in the brunch buffet. Also unlimited mimosas for $10 so can't go wrong there. Our waitress was great too, she never let us run out of drinks!"}
{"text":"Came here after watching DDD on Food Channel, did not disappoint. Duck confi flatbread was all it was on the show. Couldn't try the Burger burger burger because we were there for lunch, but waitress suggested BBQ burger, and it was off the hook. Good home brews. Crab dip was also verrrrry good, wings too. Any way great food great service great beer, the triple crown. Since two of my kids live in Charlotte, I will be back most definitely . Can't wait to try the other restaurants in Charlotte that were featured on DDD. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this life changing experience. Not only is the breakfast buffet a mile long but you can also get MTO table waffles, AND GET THIS: ALSO a made to order menu item, and they're all good. Price is very fair too. Would recommend.  Also- the bartender with bluish hair who is allergic to bananas was SOOOO great. Loved her. Such good service and so friendly."}
{"text":"Way hip and cool. I recently visited Heist to cheer on my favorite bartenders in CLT at the William Grant & Sons Best Bartender Competition and what I found was a very cool spot for some good food!  I must admit, I'm not much of a beer drinker but I'm certainly a food eater! And the Kurobuta Pork Belly Corndogs are innovative and fun! They were very tasty too! Be prepared - it's a VERY RICH bite of food. We also had the Duck Quesadilla - which was great!   The ambiance and the service was great. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was there 12/24/2015.   Loved the beers................. Seemed short staffed, service was slow-- but great job considering.   I had ordered the Duck Flat bread--WTH -- horrible. More like Duck jerky. Did get it take off the bill.    Great place for beer and hanging with friends.......... Eat before you come."}
{"text":"Decent beers. Decent eats. Decent service.   Easy parking is a plus.   Large, open space with plenty of seating.   No wait on a weekend afternoon during lunch time.   Located in NoDa, so good neighborhood vibes.   Nothing really to complain about, but nothing really memorable.   Just decent."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this review is from our visit in October 2013.  Our experience was just OK.  We sat on the patio and it took our server at least 15-20 minutes to greet us and get our drinks out.  They were out of the only stout they had leaving my husband disappointed and beer-less.  We sat on the patio, which was really nice... But we were swarmed with flies the entire time.  I had to keep my food covered with a napkin after each bite.  I realize it was outside and there's not much they can do about that, but it was like the Amityville Horror scene!  Not good.  Overall the food was good but a bit pricey for what I would expect at a brewery.  I had a beer flight but didn't really find any that I loved... Just ok.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back..."}
{"text":"5 star for the food, 2 star for the beer.  I had a few pints with friends: the stout, the peach hefe, and the porter.  I normally don't change beers like that if I find one I like.  They were not memorable.  The food on the other hand...I went Saturday for lunch and had the flatbread salad.  Amazing.  I also went back the following day for Sunday brunch.  I got there at 11:45 am and wasn't seated until around 12:30.  Once seated I hit the buffet and made up for lost time.  The oysters were good.  The corned beef was good.  I like nutmeg in mine, but still good.  They also have a waffle bar.  What I loved the most though are their biscuits.  Maybe they just taste like butter, but they tasted like heaven to me.  I'd recommend going right at 11:30 (but alcohol service can't start until noon on Sunday) or after 1:00 pm since it seemed to clear out a bit after I left."}
{"text":"I wish I had more to say about the food but we were overlooked and ignored for the time we were there. We sat at the bar while waiting for our table hoping to have some beers while waiting but the bartenders would attend to the people to the right or the left and would completely ignore us. Even when trying to call their attention with your average eye contact waving them down -nothing worked. They weren't going in order nor were they terribly busy. Refilling the water for the people to the right and taking the food offer of the people on the right. No idea why. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"The beer was great, the food on the other hand was some of the best eats I've had in a long time. Flat breads are a must try as is the beer cheese. We stopped in for lunch and placed dinner reservations for the same night to allow a little more exploration of he menu. Would recommend stopping in whenever you have a chance"}
{"text":"Stop #1 on the Trolley Pub, Heist Brewery. I have been wanting to try this place for a while now but we were not able to during our last trip due to the parking situation, they were slammed and the lot was full.  We walked in and to the back to try a few beers, I sampled the Blundus Biere, Sanctify, Vita-C and French Toasted Joe. But, decided to go with a \"Hive\" Fives since it was a lower gravity option (I normally gravitate towards the higher ABV beers but I wanted to make it through the night after Trolley Pub). We ordered the Beer Cheese but had to make it to-go since we were in a time crunch. I thought that the beer sampled tasted good and the Beer Cheese was AH-MAZING especially with the pretzel sticks for dipping. I definitely want to return to Heist for brunch or dinner when I visit again!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my first experience here. I had heard from everyone that this place was so amazing so maybe my expectations were too high.   The atmosphere is very nice, relaxed, and aesthetically pleasing. I had a delicious apple cider to start. Then things got meh.  I ordered chicken and waffles and they were wings with barely any meat on them and slightly burned. They arrived at my table stacked on a weird coil thing and a wooden plank. I had a tiny bread plate which was ridiculous to try to cut up a chicken wing on. I paid 13 dollars for maybe 8 bites of chicken and mediocre waffles.  One of my friends got chicken wings which were also burned and the same friend was informed that her food was given to a different table when we all had our food. Luckily we had some to share with her.  The desert we shared was great though.  I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you are going for drinks and a snack. Do not go here if you are hungry or on a budget."}
{"text":"Man this place is such a charming and amazing space that I wanted to like it so badly.  So cute!  Maybe my high expectations skewed my opinion? I had a flight of beers, which were good, but none were super amazing.  The porter was my favorite. We got the beer cheese with pretzels app.  OK pretty good - I'm getting excited for my flatbread after.  It was completely unremarkable unfortunately. I can forgive so-so food if there is amazing service, or vice-versa, but unfortunately that wasn't the case either.  The service left a lot to be desired as well."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, specifically for the brunch buffet which I learned is only on Sunday. I came here for a friend's bday brunch, fully expecting to devour the brunch buffet and much to my surprise there was no buffet bc it's Saturday. Sigh. Their brunch menu still has good options. After debating over a few options, I decided to go with the Carne asada flat bread and the truffle fries. When my Flatbread cane out, it was cold. So I knew it had been sitting out for a while before I got to my table. I asked them to re-warm it for me. The Carne asada Flatbread is pretty good. I do wish that it had a bit more steak on it though. I loved the fresh cilantro and pico that came on the Flatbread. I generally enjoy all of Heist's Flatbreads. The truffle fries were okay. I love truffle fries but they're becoming more of the norm than a specialty at this point. I thought that they could've used a bit more truffle oil. The truffle was subtle and seemed to get lost on the fry. I also had the champagne flight which includes 5 pours. I substituted the elder flower mimosa for a poinsettia mimosa. The only mimosa on the flight that I did not like was th kir royal. I didn't mind the raspberry flavor, I just thought the liquore was way too sweet. Troy was our server and he did a good job holding us down as we were a big party of 10."}
{"text":"After finding the correct door to enter Heist, we entered and were quickly impressed by the decor  with the wooden covered walls,  large pieces of artwork, glass enclosed brewery, and live edge wooden tables.  I wasn't there for food - although I may have to go back for it.   I tasted the Strawberry Blonde beer and would only give it 3 out of 5 stars.  It had a very red color but it was missing something.  They had a good selection of beers as well as home made sodas."}
{"text":"My oh my this place has changed.   So, my wife and I live in NoDa, and we were pretty excited when this place opened up a few years back. I remember coming for the first time, ordering the beer cheese, a Hefeweizen, and a burger with tots.   The beer cheese we fell in love with. The burger - one of the best in the city. The beer ... ok, but went fairly well with the food. Really, the selling point to us was the great atmosphere and the food.   Fast forward to our recent experience there. The awesome burgers - gone. The decent beer ... Still just meh. Thank god the beer cheese is still being served and the service was still great! But the menu change is so disappointing! Now it's shared plates. I ordered the burger burger burger plate which is essentially 3 sliders. And you can't specify how you'd like the meat cooked - so obviously my patties were a bit over cooked to my liking. The fries were mediocre. Blah blah blah.   Idk... I live in the neighborhood and I don't know if I'll be back, honestly. Even the bathroom was bit a filthy with no hand soap except for a watered down bottle of dove hand wash. That was weird. The food used to be incredible. Not so much anymore. And the beer isn't good enough to make it a destination spot. Love you Heist, but you've got some work to do! And please do, we miss the great menu!"}
{"text":"I don't even know if I can really comment on this spot. I mean I can't go into great detail. I was here for the CLT does Sade thing. I'm not going to fault this place for the okay vocalists or even the dude that rambled on in the beginning talking about the same things over and over for like 40 minutes. This has nothing to do with the spot.   I bet it's cute on a chill type vibe. Get a little drinky drink, you can chill outside where it's well lit. That's what I did. I still heard the music and I was able to people watch. Cause it was literally packed in that joint. And unless I'm dancing and the people around me are too, I can't do the stand around while people brush up against and past me.   I'm going to have to check this place out for a chill night of drinking cause I can see how the vibe is."}
{"text":"First off, the place is gorgeous.  Rustic, charming.  You can smell the wood-burning oven.  It's cozy, inviting.  I wasn't in a hurry to leave.  Our waitress was okay.  Not terribly friendly.  I felt as though we were bothering her.  The beer was pretty good.  Not the best, not the worst.  Nothing terribly noteworthy, but I'd sit down with another glass of Succession with a meal.  Which brings me to the food.  WOW!  Clearly not an afterthought.  Beer Cheese Burger on Pork Belly Brioche?!  Who does that?!  AH-mazing.  (Pro-tip:  add bacon jam.)  And Parmesan Truffle Fries - to die for.    I'd mainly go back for the food and the atmosphere & have a beer while I'm there.  Although, if you're mainly JUST looking for a really good beer, this may not be the best of choices.  Go there for the food, stay for the beer."}
{"text":"Husband and I are on a brewery crawl for our anniversary and this was our first stop in the NoDa area. We tried everything on tap and only didn't fancy one. Our favorites were the succession, french toasted joe, black market and dude, where's my coffee!"}
{"text":"We visited for the first time after recommendations from friends.  The place was just starting to get busy and by the time we left,  it was packed.   We were greeted and seated quickly (note:  lots of backless stools with high-top tables which I don't prefer); however,  we found a conventional table 4-2 by the door.   We ordered the Lamb Balls and Lobster Mac.  Both were great with the lamb being the winner.   The lobster mac was left a little long under the grill and was almost burned,  and it had a watery vs. creamy base.   Overall, it's a neat place and is true to the vibe of NoDa.  So why a low score?   Price.  Our tab with a $10 tip was $67 for two people.  One order of lamb balls,  one order of lobster mac,  one pint, and two glasses of house chardonnay--ouch! for a funky, neighborhood bar.  We asked for some bread to sop up the wonderful lamb sauce (so good).  Our waiter brought us four thin slices of toasted baguette and charged us $4.  Mac $18.  House wine $8 a glass.   The best deal was the pint at $4.50.  But, hey, what do I know?  They're busy!  At this price point, however, they have loads of higher end competitiion in Charlotte.  I doubt we will visit much opting for $9 fish tacos just up the street."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  We both had the Brewmaster Burger with rrosemary tater tots - wow!  I think it may have been the best burger I've ever had, and those tater tots are NOT what you get from the grocery store!  For a beer, I chose the I2PA and I thought it was excellent.  And on top of that, the service was just great."}
{"text":"We went here because we saw it on \"DDD\" the food was good. Had the , burger burger burger, which did not disappoint. We also tried the pork belly taco which were also good. Service was ok. My disappointment was in the cleanliness of the place. Not just your normal messiness from a busy day, but filthy. The wall behind the long booth was disgusting and looks like it had never been cleaned. The window chill was caked with old food and dirt.  Makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon on a beautiful spring day. Sat on the patio and enjoyed a couple good brews. Very chill, relaxing environment with a great band playing in the background. Made for a perfect day. Good service, good beer, great patio."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have eaten here at least 10 times over the years and the food is just always terrible.  The menu items look to have potential but they are never executed.  It is certainly not known for the beer and I don't understand how they remain open with the terrible quality of food. I ordered tonight hoping that maybe this time would be different but it wasn't. I think in the future I will just have to say no thanks when friends want to eat here. I definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try Heist Brewery this past Sunday for brunch. Upon arriving around 11:20, I was told a wait for 6 would be about 30 minutes. No problem, definitely expected this as I've heard that their brunch is a big deal. I was pleasantly surprised when our table was ready in about 7 minutes.  Our server Amanda was great, very personable and quick with our bottomless mimosa refills. The brunch buffet was delicious! The grits were creamy and seasoned perfectly, the gravy was fantastic and I definitely can't forget mentioning the grilled rum soaked pineapple- out of this world. While most buffet items were labeled, there were a few that were not and I wasn't for sure what they were.  I have been to Heist before and sampled their brews, which have always been good. I stuck with the bubbly on Sunday, but had a few friends who tried their beer say that they were flat... Probably a simple carbonation problem.  All in all, a fantastic experience. Definitely planning another trip there this Sunday!"}
{"text":"This place is cool! It feels like you're in a copper factory or mill of some sort. Unique decor and art style. Their beer selection is great and if you're a fan of cocktails, they have a good selection of those too that are served in some unique glass wear. The food is only okay.  This place is great for a gathering or after work night cap!"}
{"text":"Go for the brunch, they say. I did. It was A-OK in my book.  Heist is ideal if you want to roll out of bed, throw on a t-shirt, and eat your heart out hoping to appease any signs of a hangover from having a few too many cocktails the night before. They have a buffet filled with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese & meats, flatbreads, chicken wings, and a donut tree...and a lot more. You can order one made-to-order dish like Eggs Benedict. The waffles were not that great - a tad on the soggy side. My friend told me about the donut tree and I was very intrigued; I love donuts. I guess I'm used to restaurants making things in-house these days, so you can imagine the disappointment when I saw the employee restocking the tree from a box labeled Krispy Kreme! Don't get me wrong, the disappointment faded once I took a bite...Krispy Kreme is still a winner.  I definitely felt like an older patron and way over dressed in my cotton dress and heels. Like I said before, it's a t-shirt, yoga pants, team jersey sort of place.  They can't serve alcohol before noon on Sundays, but the moment the clock strikes twelve they walk through the building ringing a bell and then the mimosas and Bloody Mary's fly out of the bar.  Make reservations. They pack the house early and stay consistently busy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to ditch our plans at an overly priced restaurant with a prix fixed menu that we weren't all that jazzed about to try Heist. Let me say we were both SO happy to go.  He is the beer person and he said the beers were pretty good. He said sure NoDa's beers might be a little bit better but it is obvious how much emphasis is put on the food, which they don't have.  He had the Belgian Dubbel, the I2PA, and the Porter. All of which he enjoyed.  I tried two cocktails: both were awesome. Their cocktails are about as creative as the food. I had the Paloma de Pama, which is a tequila drink with chipotle salt around the rim, and the Stowaway, which comes in a tiki cup with an umbrella. Both were great.  Food-wise, we started with the 7-layer shots. Highly recommended, a very unique combination of flavors. We continued on to the duck flatbread, which was good but was probably my least favorite of the dishes we had. It has a very smoky taste. Then we had the steak and potatoes - YUM, you should try this. Last we ordered the salmon tacos, the salmon was sushi-grade so it almost tasted like tuna. Lastly, the banana eggrolls.  The ambiance was awesome, our server was awesome, I would definitely recommend and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here on the strength of the generally positive reviews. The comments about staff friendliness, attentiveness as well as the variety and flavor of the beers is all true.   Unfortunately so too are comments about the food. The hummus and goat cheese, cleverly presented in tubes was okay. The tofu steak I ordered was burnt. Prices are reasonable. Overall impression, if you are planning to come here for the beer, I think you will be pleased. If you're planning to dine there is the potential you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I died and went to bar food heaven! EVERYTHING I had was good. They hosted all 18 of us for our Holiday party upstairs on 12/18/14 and the server was so funny, very fast and never let a pint or glass go empty. BEER CHEESE DIP!!!! BACON WRAPPED DATES!!! FRIED RIBS!!! all of it was to die for. We tried many things. I cant review beer as I am not a beer drinker however they make a cider cocktail and oh  my god its apple pie in a glass with a straw! Also they make a great mule. I will be back this is on my hit list. this is a great place for a big crowd."}
{"text":"Stopped in because I have driven past this place several times. Delicious food, great beer, and a fun atmosphere!  I highly recommend the Fry Basket Ribs and Banana Eggrolls. Pure heaven!  We happened to be sitting next to Chef Rob and his family - fun people. We will be back and cannot wait to try the new menu additions coming soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I met a few friends we hadn't seen in awhile for dinner and drinks this past weekend. We had all been before but tonight we sat at the bar that is closest to N Davidson (next to the patio) and then grabbed a table back there when we got hungry.  The bartender asked what I gravitate toward, cocktail wise, and I threw out some things and he made me a great variation of a margarita. I then ordered a Paloma. Good stuff.  Food wise we got way too much. The Mac n Cheese pizza, pretzels, tot chos (tater tot natchos), salmon belly tacos and something else. The dishes come out as they are ready and it didn't take long before the food started coming at us.  We enjoyed the food, drinks and service and they were playing good music too which always helps get you in a Friday night mood!"}
{"text":"Between 3.5/4 stars- Finally getting around to review this place. We went for brunch on Sunday with our friends who live in the area. This is going to be a longer review because I have a hard time giving it a review overall.   Ambience- 5 stars. They have a perfect corner location. The outside seating is awesome and the inside has a really unique feel. Love all the screens that they have around the entire restaurant.   Price- 3 stars. It was $19 a person for brunch and we found that out when we got the check because the price wasn't listed anywhere on the menu. Not really a fan of that.  Food (I'm going to have to separate it into a la carte and the buffet)- Buffet- 5 stars. Mussels. That's all. Just kidding, they had different cheeses, eggs & grits, biscuits & gravy, turkey sausage, bacon, some wonderful pineapple, four or five different flatbreads and a carving station.  A la carte- 3 stars. While the descriptions sounded so amazing, between the four of us, none of us loved the \"main dish\" that we got. They seemed like unique ideas, but we noticed they were all super filling which made us think they wanted us to go to buffet less. Meh.   There's a good chance we will go back when we make another trip to Charlotte, but maybe just for beers or their regular menu."}
{"text":"Very tasty veggie wrap w/chili spiced edamame.  I'm not a lover of spice & was able to consume the majority of the edamame.  This was a delicious healthy meal.  Service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Brunch is brunch is brunch, right?  WRONG.    I'd heard many a great thing about Heist's Sunday brunch, but figured it couldn't be as special as everyone was making it out to be.  I expected to find the eggs, bacon, pastries, and fruit spread that is so standard at most restaurant brunches.  And yes, Heist does offer these items at its brunch buffet, but you would be doing yourself a disservice if that was all you ate.  Roasted ham, beets, and carrots; egg salad; pastry wrapped brie and blueberries; homemade donuts; biscuits and gravy; vegetable stuffed quiche; marshmellow topped sweet potato/pumpkin casserole; omelettes; and of course the meringue-topped chocolate chip waffles!  I don't even like waffles but you had better believe I'm going back to Heist this Sunday for another waffle...or two!  My only criticism is that they don't serve those tasty parmesean rosemary tots during brunch (or maybe they do and I just didn't ask).  Looks like I'll just have to go back for lunch or dinner to sample some more of those.  Oh, woe is me!"}
{"text":"Omg I really love this place! I've been here multiple times and every time is great! From the very pleasant hostess, to the great decor, awesome service and even better food! Oh and let's not forget the beer, craft cocktails, and brunch buffet!!! Last time I went I had beer cheese(every time I go!), chicken wings(full wing) with amazing flavor, and a flatbread pizza. Needless to say, they were gobbled up and washed down with a refreshing hoppy brew. My mouth is watering right now. If you wanna go and have no one to go with, hit me up! Nomnomnom!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for first time today. Family in from Florida. Family & friends live at Highland Mills.   Sadly not a pleasurable experience:   1) Slow server/checked back once 2) Buffet food less than mediocre  3) Eggs Benedict served no Hali sauce/ice cold 4) Sausage has weird spice or was spoiled 5) Dirty bar area/smelled of soiled sour towels likely from bad bar cleanup post Saturday night. 6) Buffet area so dark cannot see food  7) Shrimp and grits had ONE shrimp sliced in half folded over to look like two shrimp (are you kidding me!?)  $19.00 - plus tip per person   Arrival time 10:45am (brunch buffet opened at 11am)   Heist is geared for a young party crowd - hungover and typically without refined pallets. I would not recommend. If you MUST go I recommend only the ala cart veggie omelette."}
{"text":"The one thing I go to Heist for is BRUNCH! There brunch buffet is delicious and you also get to order one personal entree included in buffet price. My person favorite from the buffet is the rum soaked pineapple with marscapone cheese. The best entree is the steak and eggs which is made with short ribs and a spicy white BBQ sauce. In addition to this amazing buffet at noon the establishment begins bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary flights. The servers are on top of the mimosa refills, its hard to finish one before you get another! One negative is the wait, even though the restaurant is huge they don't accept reservations and its always packed. This is a brewery which I personally don't care for their beer, brunch is definitely their strong point."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Charlotte breweries that's much more than a mere brewery. Craft Beer, Bottomless Mimosas and Brunch, who can ask for more?  Favorite Beers: 1. Succession 2. Cross Pollen-nation  Location: 4/5    Near the border of NoDa; only of a couple blocks away from all the action. Parking can be tight sometimes  Atmosphere / Ambiance: 4/5     Think of a cross between a restaurant and brewery. Lot's of space and tables so larger parties can be accommodated relatively easy. The establishment is well lit and the table seating makes it less of a bar atmosphere so if you're looking to co-mingle, you might want to try else where.  Cleanliness: 5/5    Neat as a whistle  Service: 5/5    I've always had a positive experience with the servers and bartenders each time I've been there.   Food: 4/5 Heist has solid brunch. Bottomless Mimosas for $10 and an All-You-Can-Stuff-Your-Face buffet for around $15-18. That's good boozing and munching right there. There was one time when the buffet was off once, but eh it happens. Give there flat breads a try. The Chicken and Waffle flat bread was pretty interesting and yummy.  Booze: 5/5 A solid array of craft beers. My two favorites are mentioned above. A flight is always a good option to try out what they have to offer. Is a Growler too much for ya? Then take home a Crowler. Goodness in a can."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and drink. Ambiance was great. But did get seated in a weird corner. Service was nothing to rave about. But my drink The Horny Toad and my friends The Mule were both very good. On the expensive side but I milked it. Ordered the Bacon Flatbread and The Spicy wings. We were very pleased with the food. Two cocktails and two appetizers came out to about 40.00 bucks. Not to bad. Will come back."}
{"text":"I have been to Heist for drinks. I have been for their innovative dinner fare. You should go for their Sunday brunch. Mega brunch. Its a buffet with plenty of made to order options and orange juice is included. $16 gets you the traditional, savory and sweet choices - ammmmazing grits, some kind of extra special pineapple and plenty of more lunchy choices too. Its divine."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Heist. A couple of brews, some snacks and chilling out on their patio in the sun is definitely a good time.   I've been to Heist a few times and my absolute favorite thing is the patio (especially since it has been so nice out). Sometimes there is a band, which is nice. I've been here a few times and had some snacks; I've had the soft pretzels, spinach & artichoke flatbread and the nutella eggrolls - all really good and perfect if you're not starving and just feel like munching. They also have this Apple cooler cocktail thing that is fantastical. All around, everything is really good in the taste and ambiance department.  Service. All of my servers and bartenders have been really good! Super cool and attentive. The hostesses are like...really strict with the seating situation. All 3 times I have been there, the place has not been busy - as in, there are several tables open in the bar area and the patio, yet, we are told there is a 25 minute wait and that we can sip at the bar only (not the bar section, the literal bar). Ok...but after 25 minutes when I haven't seen anyone else be seated in any of the said tables nor had anyone really come in after us, it's a little strange. I have had to ask the hostess what the deal is at least 2 times before the finally seat us. I don't know, I don't get it, I guess. This wouldn't stop me from coming here or telling people how much I love Heist, just something I expect when I go here."}
{"text":"Went on a mini brewery crawl this weekend stopping at Triple C, Heist, Birdsong, and finishing with dinner at Growlers Pourhouse. Started with Triple C, now for the next stop in our evening out... Charlotte's newest brewpub; Heist Brewery.  Situated in the cultural hub of NoDa, Heist occupies the old Highland Mill building. The place is beautiful... just the right mix of new and old. You get some very nice woodwork and stonework adorning the walls, while at the same time preserving the history of the space. When you walk in there is an open space with several tables and a bar, as you pass through into the next area you pass a kitchen area with a custom wood burning pizza oven that is open to the rest of the space so that the aroma of pizza baking fills the whole building. Once you stop gawking at the pizza oven you will notice a wall full of windows showcasing the brewhouse, and another bar area. Really, in addition to being eye catching and well laid out the place is huge, there is upstairs seating and yet a third bar type area with seats and tap handles. I could hang out here all day  The service is decent, the waiter we had was attentive and polite. He tried to be helpful, and knew a fair amount about the menu, but very little about the beer.   Now, on to the menu... I feel like this place has fallen victim to \"celebrity chef syndrome\". To many dishes that try to be just a bit too clever. Too little food for too high a price.  Lobster Bisque Test Tubes, BBQ Braised Pork Belly Corn Dogs, Asian Shrimp with Lemon Wasabi Cotton Candy?, Chicken and Waffles... C'mon man!! The burgers, and flat breads don't look too bad, but lets stop trying so hard to be the next food network star.  Now on to the main attraction... The beer. Unfortunately I am underwhelmed by the beer. Eleven house made beers on tap and all of the mediocre at best. How about we cut the beer menu down to a manageable four or five offerings and make the shine!! I don't need ten or eleven beers from a new start up brewery, I need two or three beers that blow my hair back (back when I had hair). We ordered two samplers so that we could try all of the beers, I thought the oatmeal stout was the best beer of the bunch. I would go on to describe the rest of them but I forgot about them even as I was drinking them. Now, don't get me wrong. None of the beers were deeply flawed, just uninspired. While none of them knocked my socks off, none of them were offensive or had bad off flavors either, just boring. I'm not looking for crazy, extreme beers, just good beers done well.  I really wanted to like this place. I was pulling for them to be the next great Charlotte area brewery... and they still could be, but there is work to be done.  All in all I am ready for the next place, on to Birdsong..."}
{"text":"I've read and heard mixed reviews of Heist Brewery, so I was not quite sure what to expect.  My diagnosis: I'm a fan!  First, the atmosphere - the place is great for eating or just hanging out with a really nice vibe.  Second, the drinks. Although I cannot attest to the beer,  as I am not a beer-drinker, the cocktails were delicious. They were tasty, flavorful and unique. Lastly, the food.  I ordered the crab burger and was pleasantly surprised.  The crab burger at Heist was massive and yummy.   I think the small portions comments will really depend on what you give.  Some of the appetizers are going to be very small; however, the burgers are huge and come with a side.   I do have a complaint - I am not a HUGE fan of the 'tater tots,' I appreciate the attempt to put a homemade twist on an old classic, but either the potato insides need to be more cooked, or the outside needs to be a little crispier.   Bottom Line:  I think this is a great place for groups, hangouts and grabbing a bite -- probably not the best for an intimate date- but other than that, I got no complaints!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch  Though I have been to Heist about a dozen times for dinner or drinks, today was my first time going for brunch.   Unlike some other brunch spots, Heist has plenty of seating and parking.  Though busy our group was seated right away on the patio. While there over 90 minutes I didn't notice anyone waiting more that a minute to be seated, and that was only if the hostess was away from her stand seating an earlier party.   The breakfast buffet was nice (scrabbled eggs, grits, bacon, turkey sausage, chicken wings, mussels, variety of cheeses and hard meats, breakfast flat breads, unlimited OJ and apple juice) plus one à la cart item.   There was a regular menu that I didn't look at as the group had already decided on the buffet when I arrived.   I knocked off one star because the waiter could have stopped by 1-2 more times to offer coffee (my cup was empty for about 10 minutes) and the price was about $3-5 higher than I think it could be."}
{"text":"Met some friends here and shared a few dishes. The pimento cheese flatbread is amazing. My husband and I can't wait to go back and work our way through the menu."}
{"text":"I was only in town for one evening, and this greatly limited my options. It seems that Charlotte has had a ton of new brewpubs open up within the past five years. The only issue to me, however, was that nearly none of them were open past 9:00 pm on a Tuesday night. So I headed to Heist Brewery, pretty much the only one in town that is.  I found the space to be quite lovely. Despite a nondescript exterior in an industrial part of town, the interior had been done-up quite nicely with great light fixtures, beautiful bars, a ton of space and a pretty high-class feel. The only issue I had was with the floor in the main seating area, which wasn't leveled during finishing causing the high-top tables and chairs to wobble on a consistent basis.  While I found the place to be nicely classy, I found the food to be overly so, to the point of being pretentious. I do not need any of my food to be served in test tubes (the bisque) or on top of a flat rock (torched diablos). What's more, the small plates are exorbitantly priced, typically costing about a dollar per bite.  Take, for example, the tater tots. Even if they are the best tater tots in the world (they're not), I still think a side order of them should come with more than four morsels of food.  On the other hand, the burger I shared with my fiance was fairly priced at $9 and quite delicious. A blend of smoked brisket and porterhouse tail is an awesome idea, and putting bacon and caramelized onions on top is always a good idea. So I have mixed feelings about the menu. While some options are pleasantly priced and inventive, much of it goes overboard.  I wish they'd take some of that culinary inventiveness and apply it to their brewing. Every option I tried was tired and boring. Some of them were very bland, while a couple of them were quaffable. Perhaps the brewery just has some growing up to do, or needs a bit more practice. But whatever the reason, I was not impressed by the beer in the least.  On a final note, the service was a bit much at times. While attention is nice, dropping by the table every five minutes becomes annoying at some point, as does terrible jokes and lame descriptions of the beer. While I give an A for effort, again, the execution just isn't quite there."}
{"text":"Loved the beer, the brunch and the atmosphere. Great management and a fantastic experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Clayton and the head chef our first experience here was over the top enjoyable. They were both super accommodating. The food was delicious and the beer is great.   We will certainly return. Thanks! Btw special request honey mustard. It is delicious. Thanks Chef."}
{"text":"Heist is cool... Sometimes a bit too cool... The beer is fantastic but the food is hit or miss. High prices for small portion sizes (tapas style) eats that are meh. Squeezing hummus and goat cheese out of a metal roll tube... I'll pass. Brunch was a swing and a miss. Buffet style with food that just didn't do it.   Go for the beer and atmosphere. Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is expansive. Envisioning the old property when it was Prevue is not even fair. The old front door is storage, so walk around the side at the front of Highland Mills and into the newest and most unique dining experience in Charlotte.  Walking back passed the kitchen and front bar and into the dining area is awesome. Not in the 80's way, but in the way that inspires awe. The smells from the kitchen permeate throughout with a delicious meaty overtones. Walked upstairs for a birds eye view, we started with the pimento cheese crab dip, pork belly corn dogs and chicken and waffles. The last of which is the all star of the limited opening night menu. The honey and orange zest NAIL it. Washing it all down with an oatmeal stoudt, a station #7 red ale, a hefeweizen, a light lager, and a blueberry pale ale is par for the fantastic course... I will be back for brunches in two weeks."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for lunch one weekend and it was fantastic. They have an outdoor seating area which would have been wonderful if they had room for us! We sat inside right near the brewery area and we all sampled different kinds of beer which were all fantastic. Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I had the bruschetta flatbread which was delicious. The fire roasted tomatoes were incredibly sweet and delicious and the balsamic was the perfect touch. Some other items that my family ordered were the fish tacos, bbq burger, chicken parmesan sandwich and the duck flatbread. All of them were very very happy. I can't wait to go back and sample something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer and atmosphere- you must try the beer cheese dip!  Pretty busy on weekends but tables are cool, and it's fun to be able to see the brewery area through the wall of glass!"}
{"text":"The food is good and rather creative but unfortunately that's the best of it. Of the four local NoDa breweries Heist has the worst beer.  The service is rather terrible as well.  I went yesterday with a large party to have some drinks and watch the World Series but the bartender was rude and too lazy to change the channel for us although they had the same football game on 4 tvs.  I asked to speak to the manager from a polite waitress and after waiting for more than ten minutes we left.  So if you're looking for mediocre beer, bad service, and some good food this is your place."}
{"text":"Not a fan of tapas in the first place. No worries if it is just an option on the menu but I went there expecting a full meal and spent $30 and left hungry with no notable experiences.  Wish they'd go to a menu with full course meals."}
{"text":"Went long while back, first time having chicken and waffles and they were amazing. Heard chicken and waffle tacos are lacking.   Supposedly food has gone downhill since, but still interested in finding out if true myself."}
{"text":"Fun, Funky place. Great food, a good signature drink is the Moscow Mule/Texan Mule. Relaxed atmosphere with a good feel, nice servers."}
{"text":"First of all was seated right by the door.  Don t usually have a problem with that until we realized our waitress had all of the tables in that area which were 2 huge parties of at least 20 each!   Wish I was exaggerating!  So we all know that was the kiss of death for service.  She already had 40 people she was waiting on NOT her fault.  I hope the beer lines had been just cleaned and they hadn't rinsed them. The V.9 tasted like soap. Not that I could ask for something else because she was in the weeds.  The carne asada meat looked anemic and was  tuff.  The chicken salad had the greens grilled and the chicken cold.    Needless to say not impressed only gave it a 2 because it's not the waitresses fault that they over seated her with no help!  Probably 4 times try and done!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like trying new breweries when we are traveling, so we decided to try Heist Brewery when we were in Charlotte today.  We were the first people in the restaurant when they opened at 11:30 AM and were seated immediately. Our server brought us waters and we decided to order a flight of beers from their list of about 12 beers. The flight was reasonably priced, with 5 generous pours for $6.   The beers that we tried were: I2PA, peach hefeweizen, Belgian tripel, maibock and a stout. Personally, I liked the peach hefe and the maibock (my favorite). I thought the stout was too dry. I really did not care for the Belgian tripel and I am normally a big fan of Belgian style beers. I did not try the IPA personally, but my husband said it was his favorite. After our flight, I ordered a peach hefe in a pint and my husband ordered the pale ale. He liked the pale as well. So overall, the beers were a little hit or miss, but the hits were good ones!  We also ordered lunch. I ordered the pressed cheese sandwich with the rosemary tater tots. The sandwich was a warm pimento cheese sandwich topped with sweet pickles. It was served on jalapeno-bacon focaccia bread. The sandwich was fantastic. It was surprisingly spicy and the flavor of the bread added a lot to the sandwich. My husband ordered the Italian sandwich. He also was a big fan of his sandwich. All of the breads here are homemade, and it showed. The tots were good, but not outstanding and the portion size was small (four tots each).  Our server was very friendly and attentive and the space itself is very cool. It is a fun industrial setting with a large bar and plenty of seating. The interesting food menu definitely has a lot of potential!  We will return the next time we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love this place and my first attempt at brunch here did not disappoint at all. Great food and plenty of it with a variety of the Heist menu items to try."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here. There's a reason Guy Fieri stops here any time he is in the area.  The food is beyond amazing, service is exceptional and they have a huge choice of beers.  Only thing I wish I could change would be to have the ability to get their beer closer to home (they do not distribute).  Will be back over and over again.  If you don't come here your a FOOL!"}
{"text":"For a brewery with such great character and location, you would think/hope the customer service would be acceptable especially on a Saturday night. I have never been a fan of the heist brews (I enjoy almost every craft beer I've tried) and this 3rd visit will be my last even for the menu and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great beer. So-so food.   Seriously, why would you serve hummus and goat cheese in toothpaste-esqu tubes. The bruschetta was over the top in terms of quanity but kinda flavorless.  Good beer cheese.   Beer is fantastic, I'll be back for that."}
{"text":"Ok Heist, I've liked you in the past, but tonight was a pretty dick move.  My girlfriend and I head in about 12:30 am for some sweet eats - and stand forever by the sign that says \"Please wait HERE to be seated\".  After the torture of being ignored for an extended period, we helped ourselves to some menus and wandered over to the bar and sat down where we were ignored by the bartender until I could finally make it impossible for him to avoid me, and then he tells us you don't serve food after midnight.  Not entirely sure how we were supposed to know that?  I'm assuming we would have still been standing by the hostess sign until 2 when you close.  Please work toward making the night time service as good as the food."}
{"text":"Got the American Cheeseburger with Truffle Fries.  All very good, and the spicy mayo was a nice touch.  That said, nothing really unique or outstanding.  Service was good, beer was cold.  Not a bad meal."}
{"text":"House Brewed Sarsaparilla Root Beer might be the Best Brew reviewed so far (by anyone)!  I'm giving the Root Beer close to five yelp stars!  Next time we will get the House Brewed Cherry Soda and I'll request it in a Frosted Mug with No Ice!  This Soda is carrying the review!  This place is Cool!  They did a great job decorating!  It is BELIEVABLE!  Big Bar and nice sized Dinning Room in the front, smaller Bar and Bigger Dinning Room with Huge Glass wall so you can see the Brewery in the back!  Balcony Dinning Room overlooks the Brewing room and large Dinning Room!  Nice smaller outdoor Patio!  The Service was Excellent and if it were not for our server recommending a House Brewed Soda this would be a 2 star review!  The Service gets 5 stars!  Everyone was Friendly and pleasant!  Even though I would rather have rude or snobby Service and MUCH Better food, great Service is nice and I guess I appreciate it, really I do NOT expect it, though it weighs very light in my reviews!  The food is bringing my review stars down!  Since my math skills suck (means this is probably really a 2 1/2 star review) and this was my first dine (they have not been open very long either) I'll be gentle!  The Root Beer was a Great start!  The Root Beer BBQ Sauce was very good and probably saved the Pork-belly Corn-dogs which did not have much flavor and what flavor they did have was NOT good!  Pork-belly Corn-dogs without BBQ Sauce get 2 yelp stars and with the BBQ Sauce get 3 stars!    Duck and Shallot Flat-bread with Mozzarella Cheese and Root Beer BBQ Sauce would have been better without the Duck (call it Shallot and Mozzarella Flat bread) or they could have put More Duck and we may have known we were eating Duck... Meaning the Duck was a little more like Bacon bits.  Still the Flavor was good enough for 3 stars, more would be too generous!  Now for the worst part of the review... We asked for the most unique Dessert they had since we knew we were going to a Bakery (down the Street, you know the one) right after for a real Dessert!  We probably got the most unique Dessert they had from the sounds of the others!  The Deep Fried Bananas with not much more than Sugar and Cinnamon on the outside and a Cream cheese Dip, more than disappointing it was the opposite of good! 1 yelp star seems too Generous!"}
{"text":"I came when it first open and I loved the food. The beer I wasn't the biggest fan of but the food was worth the trip. Then I had to leave town for work and when I came back I heard they had Sunday Brunch. I love the brunch. It's a buffet with a choice of one specialty item. Then when it hits noon the alcohol is available. Love the mimosas. The brunch buffet is awesome. I love the grilled pineapple. My favorite of the specialty item would have the hash with egg. Soooooo good. I have been the told the beer is top notch now. I just haven't had a chance to try it. Will be going back to try the beer again."}
{"text":"Cool place liked the drinks loved the flatbreads. I'm not a local, never heard of this place but wanted to try some new things. We told the bar tender what we liked porters/stouts for me wheat for Aubs and we let him order flights for us. The Ruckus imperial stout was delicious, if I lived in the area I would have gotten a growler. They had a limited quantity maple beer which we both liked, it was Aubs's fav tasted like a breakfast beer if there is such a thing, we also enjoyed the out to pasture. The grand optimist and succession were decent. The bar tender picked well for our tastes.  After seeing the flatbreads come out of the oven by the entrance we were compelled to give it a try. The bar tender confirmed that the BBQ duck flatbread and chicken waffle flatbread were great choices. Again he was right. They make their own root beer in house which is then used to make the BBQ sauce. The duck was lean, the flatbread was flavorful. The chicken and waffle flatbread had large cubes of chicken and bite sized pieces of waffle all covered in maple syrup. Aubs liked the sweeter chicken/waffle better, I preferred the savory BBQ duck.  My advice is to sit at the bar, tell them what you like and let them order for you. Sometimes it's nice to be babied at the brewery."}
{"text":"Went to Heist this Sunday for brunch.  I was very excited to take my mom since she's never been and my experience in the past (although it's been over a year) was really excellent.  So, it was very disappointing when we first arrived and were greeted by a very RUDE hostess who obviously woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  After being told that since we didn't have a reservation we would not be able to sit inside, I asked to just please check...well it seems that there was a table available after all as she rolled her eyes.  The brunch itself was set up in the in-between hall with the food displayed without any sings and it was dark (you could hardly tell what each item was).  The waffle bar, which I loved so much last time I was there, was gone; the make to order omelet bar was gone, the mussels were just thrown together in a tray. The entire presentation of food was very disappointing and more importantly the food was not good. It was bland and boring.  Heist brunch is too expensive for it to be anything short of amazing.  And it fell short...very short.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Beer has gotten much better. Citra quench is amazing. Wish it was available all the time. Hopefully they can keep it consistent!"}
{"text":"I can write an ode to Heist Brewery and their Sunday Brunch. A big projector plays the Sunday NFL games, along with a variety of TVs. With $10 bottomless mimosas and a $16 all you can eat buffet, where can you go wrong? Aside from having traditional breakfast options like biscuits and gravy, eggs, and pancakes, Heist takes it a step further. They offer grilled pizzas, wings, an assortment of desserts, and twists on traditional breakfast options. The Butterfinger French Toast and Rum Soaked Grilled Pineapple are unreal. Stefan the Bartender is a master mixologist. This place is a must go!"}
{"text":"I have heard and read so much about this place and finally got the opportunity to try it out this past Saturday.  I am really glad I got the chance.  It has a lot of really good things going for it.  The atmosphere was pretty loud as you would expect on a Saturday evening at a place that serves its own beer.  The design of the place was really cool, casual, and trendy.  I really liked the exposed brick and the light fixtures made of old jars.  We were seated at a table right across from the kitchen so we got to watch the cooks prepare the dishes which was pretty interesting.    The waitress was extremely pleasant but it was easy to tell that she was overwhelmed.  I'm not sure if they were short-staffed on this particular evening or what, but there were long periods of time when we didn't see her.  On a less busy night, she would have been great.  Although all that other stuff was important, the main reasons we came here were the food and the beer.  There were so many creative small plate options on the menu that we really struggled to pick just one.  We went with the chicken and waffles sushi.  I had no idea what this thing was going to look like; but when the plate came out and I saw it, it all made perfect sense.  It was basically five thin waffles wrapped around fried chicken pieces with gravy on top, laying in a pool of syrup.  It was pretty much amazing.  I also ordered the jerk chicken flatbread which was really good as well.  The one thing I will point out with this particular flatbread is that I expected the chicken to be similar to Jamaican jerk chicken with the spicy sauce and whatnot (as the name would suggest), but it was just normal grilled chicken.  Still, it was really good.   And finally, the beer.  There were about ten different types.  I had 5 of them (no I'm not an alcoholic, I ordered a flight which is a 5 beer sampler).  They all were distinct and really good.  The types varied from a porter to a light lager.  Frankly, it's hard to beat fresh-brewed draft beer.  There were also growlers for sale for those interested in taking some home for later.  Ultimately, this is a really good place with a cool atmosphere, unique dishes, and good beer.  I was really happy to try it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not only does this place have a great beer selection, it very well may be the best Sunday brunch in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is a review for their Sunday buffet.  I'm really torn.  The food was quite good, but there was one overwhelming theme (there were 7 of us and we all agreed).....the food was stone cold.  Seriously.  The waffles were delicious even cold, they are by request so you have to wait for them to be brought out to your table from the kitchen.  You'd think items direct from the kitchen would be hot!  Ditto with the omelettes.  You select your toppings and give the card to the waiter...he brought back one of my dining partners a stone cold omelette.  Wtf?  The buffet itself was really delicious, but NOTHING was hot.  They had most items just on platters - ie, NO chaffing dishes or anything to keep it warm.  Very disappointing.  Highlights:  the rum soaked pineapple and egg rolls.    See why i'm torn?"}
{"text":"The brunch buffet is amazing, offering variety of well cooked dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"Cool vibe inside - mostly high tops.  Cozy little patios would be nice in spring and fall for sure.  Lots of TVs and screens for sports.   Beer is delicious.  It is nice that they have food, since most of the breweries in the area do not...But, the food is very heavy.  Everything we ordered was spicy and/or super rich.  Maybe we made the mistake of going to eat for lunch instead of dinner.  It was just a super heavy meal."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Beer is good and food is even better.  Lots of unique options. We had the mini hot dogs, Caesar salad egg rolls and rib fries. Our friends had the beer cheese dip with pretzel sticks. Everyone enjoyed the food and the vibe of the place is great."}
{"text":"Happened upon Heist while exploring NoDa. Decided to try a flight of beer, really good flavors on each of the 5. Food looked delicious as well.   The patio is great for any time of day, with family on a Saturday afternoon or late night with friends.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"AWESOME aewsome flatbread pizza's! Came here as a stop on the walking foodtour of NoDa and Heist was EASILY my favorite stop of all.  The owner is a young entrepreneur who hails from NH and has a great story to tell. He's a beer lover, good food lover and very passionate about his business. Everyone should love what they do THIS much!   We tried some of their craft beer and house-made soda's - both delicious and unique. But what I loved most were the 3 kinds of flatbread's we got to try.   I was surpsised that as a meat lover, my favorite pizza was actually vegetarian. Kale, cheese and PERFECTLY roasted tomatoes all on top of a crunchy yet hearty crust. OH SO GOOD. They also had a mac and cheese pizza that looked like it was a crowd pleaser.   I would totally come back if I'm back in NC! Just a chill place to hang out with friends, drink some beer, eat some hearty food in a laid back but hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to this place last Sunday for brunch, and of course my favorite thing is the $10 bottomless mimosas special. They have a good brunch buffet, with a variety of food. I ate from baked brie, mushroom quiche (not my favorite, it was cold and didn't taste very good), the pizza flatbread with salmon was delicious, I also liked the cheese grits, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, they had some kind of sausage gravy that was good, and I better not forget to mention the amazing chocolate cover strawberries (I love them) and a lot of other things. After all that food, incredibly I still had room to eat some waffles. I like mine with strawberry syrup but they had some other options there. I didn't get to try the omelets, but I will make sure to do so next time. So the food was very good for $15 brunch buffet and the service was also very good. Our waitress was on top of things and very friendly. We didn't have to wait at all for a table but then again we were there a lil early, right before noon. If you find yourself in the NODA area on a Sunday morning, make sure to stop by and stuff your face with a lot of food and don't forget the mimosas =)"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. After researching local brewery restaurants, Heist had the highest reviews of breweries with food served at them vs food trucks outside.   We arrived just after 2pm and we had to order off of a limited menu which include a few appetizers and a handful of flatbread options. We decided to stay because we didn't want to continue searching for another place to have lunch.   I was surprised and underwhelmed by the beer menu options so I decided to stick with water. I did try a sample of my friend's' beers and wasn't very impressed.   I ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread and it took a while to come out. Then my friends' food wasn't served for another 5 minutes so mine became cold while waiting for theirs to be served. The chicken on my flatbread was sparse and the buffalo sauce was not balanced with a ranch or blue cheese dressing so I was drinking my water quickly. The waitress never refilled/replaced the water bottle on our table.   I was still hungry so I ordered the beer cheese pretzels appetizer and the pretzels were tasty. The sauce was okay but not well-balanced.   Everything was overpriced at $12+ other than a veggie flatbread at $10.   I'm giving two stars because the atmosphere seemed cool and the pretzels themselves were well cooked and presented. That said, we will not be rushing back."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that Heist has an amazing atmosphere and their outdoor area is great for warmer weather. That being said, the food is creative but not outstanding and the service is lackluster.   I loved the tofu and 3 bean burger (some of the only vegan/vegetarian options) and both have been removed from the menu. Today I got the fish tacos and it was a mess. The \"taco\" was falling apart, covered in sauces and had one large chunk of fish on each one. It was impossible to eat as an actual taco without needing a bib or roll of paper towels. Taste wise? Just okay.   The service has declined over time and starts slow from the moment you walk in the door. The hostesses never seem to know what's going on and take a gazillion years to seat people. The servers always seem to be busy - even if the restaurant is half empty. The bartenders are the only ones I really see hustling to get things done timely.   They do have the craft beer thing going for them and they are the only brewery in NoDa that has a restaurant too. But their beer doesn't compete with NoDa or Birdsong. They do always have a good section but it doesn't appear they've found their winning beer yet. You know, the one they'll be known for and will keep on the menu.    I was disappointed in brunch at Heist, too. The waffles were the best part and that's because of the whipped cream.   I want to LOVE Heist. It has such a good space, creative dishes and isn't a chain but I'm stuck on just liking it. If they put a little more effort into the quality of food and ability for their guests to eat it along with the service, I think they could be a 5 star place - especially as NoDa continues to grow."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the best restaurants and breweries in North Carolina. Heist Brewery has many things to offer including a hipster atmosphere, delicious craft beers, and uniquely concocted meals that are perfect for sharing with friends."}
{"text":"Good beer...I tried a flight, stand outs were the Hefewezien, Dubbel and the Red 7., but to me the true standout is the food. I have never seen such an innovative menu at a brewery. Think years past of Southend Brewery, but improved. I was in the mood for a burger and wings.  I know what your thinking that is not innovative for a brewery in  the least, but that is what I was in the mood for.  Both were very good and definitely the chef had their own spin on each. This is far from bar food. Next time I will try something else, not because they were bad, but  there seems to be so many good options here."}
{"text":"Heist didn't win me and my friends over. Great location, very welcoming interior, but that's where the excitement stopped for us. We felt the food could have been much better and the specialty cocktails were decent. The hostess was great but our server wasn't the best. With so many great bars in the NoDa area I'm not sure I'd be willing to return."}
{"text":"We just discovered by reviewing our credit card statement that our server increased his tip without our knowledge.  I wonder how many others this has happened to?  Burger was good service sucked."}
{"text":"Got here early in time for the beginning of their \"Not so small batch\" beer release (apparently every Monday) which is awesome since we were able to interact with bartender (BTW Maggie is great! Made us out-of-town visitors feel right at home) and hang out.  Great atmosphere, great beer craftsmanship and service! Well played, Charlotte! When we are in town, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by heist a few times since being in town, it's probably one of the more popular breweries in NoDa and has a really good space.   They have a pretty good brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday, you can either do their buffet or À la carte. Good selection, and the outdoor patio makes for a good aesthetic.  Despite being a brewery, they also make some of the best craft cocktails in town. Definitely don't let the 'brewery' throw you off, their bartenders can make a mean drink.  Food in general has always been above par ranging from traditional bar foods to a few tasteful twists on classics that always go down well with a brew.  My only fault with heist would be be service. Every time I have been in for food, my waiter has somehow forgotten my food order. I didn't want this to influence my opinion, but once it happened more than once and became a trend it was warranted. More notably, none of my servers attempted to curb my frustration with an apology or discount which is standard practice at most other restaurants.  All in all, I would recommend heist. While their service is at times slow, their product is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a colleague..They have a lunch menu available with an assortment of dishes.I ordered the Carne Asada flatbread.I didn't know what to expect,but it was very tasty.Sometimes when you order steak as a meat topping it can take an extra few chews because of the texture.Not this steak!The quality and texture of the meat was on point and everything went well together.I recommend this dish!"}
{"text":"Really good beers, especially the IPAs, a lot better flavor than the first time I was there. All the IPAs are hazy to a degree like a New England. The food is also better. Had a tasty smoked turkey wrap and the side I order was the loaded potato soup but it really should be called a cheese soup with potatoes, very flavorful with onions and bacon. Good dark wood atmosphere. The foods a little pricey for pub grub."}
{"text":"I came to Heist with some friends for afternoon drinks. I should start off by saying that I am not a beer drinker. So I ordered a mule from the cocktail menu, it was good. Definitely less of a ginger taste than most places but I prefer it that way. My friends each ordered beers, one got the peaches and cream which she liked. I can't remember the name of the other beer.   We ordered the pretzels and beer cheese and oh my gosh. It is a must. My coworkers are big fans of pretzels and cheese so we always order it at company happy hours and out of all the pretzels and beer cheese I've eaten lately I have to say this was by far the best.   The atmosphere is very cool. The tables are high tops and pretty close together, but they overlook the brewing facility which adds a nice touch.   Only bad part of my visit was when a waitress walked by and dropped an open container of ranch that splattered all over us and the table behind us and no one even came over to offer us napkins to wipe it up or to apologize.   I am looking forward to coming back and trying more of the food and drink options -- and brunch!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not amazing either.  Pros? -Can sit and watch the beer being made -Lovely duck quesadilla! -Quick service -Plenty of seating  Cons? -Beer was a bit watery -Service could have been more friendly"}
{"text":"Love this place so much. Love the bar manager (Stefan!), love the founder (Kurt!), love the beer and love the food. What's not to love?   Single-handedly the best unfiltered double IPA I've ever had, will have, or hope to have. Bless these people for providing a crowler for us of this delicious brew, because I don't live in Charlotte and I knew this beast was gonna tap out in days.  SO GOOD.  All their beer is good. It's creative, well made, interesting, flavorful beer. Fans of good beer, no matter what your flavor preference, will love this beer.  Food is also phenomenal. I loved their flat bread pizzas and late night options, which recently allowed me to avoid a potentially hangry hangover experience.  Gear is also something special. Racerback Ladies Tees in cool colors are the way into my heart, Heist! THANK YOU.  Every single time I come back to Charlotte, I will go here. Heist is amazing, hands-down."}
{"text":"I have been so happy to see Heist turn things around from when they were not producing good beer years ago. Our recent visit during Queens Feast Restaurant Week was not quite five-stars, as we were seated at a two-top that had lots of server/waiter traffic rushing by, but it didn't get in the way of us wanting to come back.  Interestingly enough, it was the focaccia and desserts that stole the show; our main courses were good, just not as memorable. I love their wings and really enjoy their beer, so overall the food gets high marks in my book. As is expected in NoDa, parking was limited on a busy Friday night. I was particualry impressed with the ka kau and brunch junkie beers and the blackberry pickin sour had real bright color and full flavor. Keep it going Heist! I look forward to seeing how popular the new event space is that just opened."}
{"text":"Fantastic Customer Service!!!  We got there too late to eat, but Spencer gave us a quick tour and made us feel at home.  Great beers and fantastic atmosphere.  We will definatley be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Heist has very good beer. The only reason I gave them 2 stars. Went for a double date there over the weekend and the wait was a hour and 20 minutes. So we decided to wait and have a few beers before we were sat. (Wild Bois is my favorite.) We finally got sat and our server was okay. They were pretty busy so we were forgiving for the lengthy periods of not coming to our table. We ordered 4 appetizers to share..they all came out at different times. The wings arrived first and were ice cold. Next we received the fried macaroni and cheese balls but they had no flavor..though the sauce they serve with it on the side was good. 20 minutes later we received the pork belly tacos..the flavor was good but the pork was so dry it made it hard to chew. Lastly we had the edamame, no complaints there, they're pretty tasty! I'll return for a beer or two but definitely not for the food."}
{"text":"Decently done craft brews. Nothing amazing nothing bad. Their flavors are a little over powering and it tastes a little more like a home brew than a brew house. But the atmosphere is great and service friendly and knowledgeable about the beers they serve."}
{"text":"Came here on a  Monday night, it was not busy. I ordered a mixed drink: the raspberry mule and it was delicious!   It was a work outing - for my fiance - so we had a large table.   The beer cheese, was yummy! Its a little on the thicker side, but that did not bother me that much.  The fish tacos were pretty good as well. They use cod, which is good since I do not like tilapia. It had a little spicy to it, but still very good.  We had several flat breads - some I do not even know the name of. One was a Mongolian and it was so gooood. It did have a bit too much sour cream for my liking, but i just took some of it off. They had a bruschetta flatbread as well and it was very good, but had a little too much balsamic drizzle. (Definitely a good veggie option). I had another one, it had a bbq drizzle, i think, but that was very delicious; my favorite of them all.   There was way more food on the table as well - I just did not get a chance to taste them because I was way too full from everything else I ate!!  The food, overall was good for bar food. The place was way bigger than I thought it would be; plenty of tables and even a patio."}
{"text":"fresh beer. met there before walking to neighborhood theater... Fish looked good, ribs tasty.   the Sausage and peroigies was too  SMALL on portion. I ended up eating one of the burger burger burgers of one of our group."}
{"text":"Great little place to go and have a beer and some upscale bar food.  Every time we are home in Charlotte this is one of the breweries we like to stop in at.  Their patio is great in the summer time and they have TVs to watch sports on.  They have some great beers in tap too.  We love supporting locally owned breweries and this is a good one!!"}
{"text":"We started out here on an afternoon brewery spree in the NoDa area. They had a pretty cool food menu. You should know, the cheeseburger is actually a cheeseburger flavored pizza on flatbread, despite the server saying this to our several group members that ordered it that was on flatbread, everyone still thought it would be like a panini.  I had the BBQ burger and it was awesome. Tater tots are rosemary and parmesan flavored and were pretty interesting as well. Someone also got the Reuben which I liked as well, but the BBQ burger was the best order on our table.   The beers here are all good, most are fairly light. I liked the dubbel the most, but the hefeweizen and blueberry blonde were also very good. The flights are a good deal here: five 4oz samples for $6 I think. They also make a lot of their own sodas which we were able to sample and they were all great too! They make floats!    The venue was really cool, really open warehouse-sized dining room with lots of TVs and see-through panes into the brewing area. They were brewing when we were in and the whole place smelled really-malty which was cool.    Our server was very helpful and patient with my larger group, with several ordering flights."}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch on Sunday and feel in love. Great atmosphere.  Great Food.  Great service.  I had the Bloody Mary flight, which I found to be very original and interesting.  Also had the small plate of Short Rib Hash - To DIE For! Very Tender beef, perfectly cooked potatoes - really well tasty.  And just the right amount.  The buffet was also set up and they had a lot of variety.  All in all Loved this place.  And will go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Heist three times, all for different meals. The only ~cool~ thing about Heist is the location, the ambiance, the decor, and they have a really nice outdoor seating area. Other than that I would overall just avoid going here, especially considering service has always been a 2/5 going here.   First, DO NOT GO FOR BRUNCH. The deal that they have seems amazing at first, but once you try the food its just...so disappointing. They have an all you can eat hot bar which I would call a lukewarm bar with a random assortment of dishes ranging from mussels to a casserole dish to sandwich meats and muffins. Also included is one item from their brunch menu that all sound great, but might be the worst food I've ever had. Eggs and beans were cold, the tortilla was soggy, yet hard at the same time? My friend got steak and eggs which consisted of two quarter-sized pieces of steak with cold scrambled eggs. I could go on for another two pages about how entertainingly bad this experience was. Also, their bloody mary and their champagne flight are also horrible. Most of the champagne tasted either like perfume or dishwashing soap. They use in-house bloody mary mix which is very watered down and has zero flavor.   Second, I came here for lunch to give them another try. Their menu is just very very fast with items from kimchi to steak and waffle tacos to a large assortment of flatbreads. Most of the items on the menu are overpriced in my opinion. My friends have liked the burgers. I got a caesar salad, that was very small as an entree option which was sad. The dips they have are a-ok. I think they really need to scale back their menu because nothing on it tastes bad, its just that everything tastes mediocre, and is very expensive.   Lastly, I came here most recently for trivia night and it was fantastic. The trivia host really made the night for me. Food wise, I ordered the truffle fries that came with a \"not-yo-mama's-ketchup\". This is the only thing I would recommend getting without being disappointed. The presentation is nice as the fries come in a little frying basket and the sauce reminded me of a mix of sweet and sour sauce with ketchup and red pepper flakes. The beer selection is alright. None of them have really stood out to me. I would suggest getting the average-joe as it is light and refreshing, and is overall pretty average but not disappointing.   Overall, if you are still not convinced that heist is not worth your money and really really really want to try it for yourself, I would recommend going for lunch and sitting outside. You might have a 2/5 experience at best."}
{"text":"I really like this place for drinks since they not only brew their own beer (which the fella likes), but they also have wine and a full bar for those of us non-beer drinkers.  The food is always creative, inventive and tasty, and the atmosphere is lively, but cozy.    I finally got to try their Sunday brunch buffet ($15), which starts at 11:00 a.m.  Don't be fooled by the 11:30 listing on their website/Facebook page.  When we got there at 10:59, we were about the 20th people in line!  Get there early and be prepared to wait in line for the buffet, but it'll be worth it.  Today's line up was flatbread pizza, fruit compote with brie, sausage, bacon, eggs, Eggs Over Baghdad, muffins, cobblers, oysters, crawfish, an omelet station and a waffle station with just about the best waffle I've ever had.    The brunch is leisurely enough that we were still there at noon when the bartenders rang the bell letting you know it was time for alcohol sales!  The waiters come around a little before noon to take orders so they're delivering the drinks right at noon, which I appreciate.  Our bottomless mimosas ($10) were served in tall, skinny shot glasses, and they really never did stop coming.  If my stomach can ever hold out til 11 a.m. again, this'll be the place I hit!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST brunch buffet in Charlotte, in my humble opinion. Eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, potatoes, donuts, biscuits, muffins, fruit, grits, waffles - they've got all your breakfast staples covered. I have yet to try something that isn't muy delicioso. My only disappointment is that my stomach isn't quite big enough (yet!) for me to veg on Heist's patio on a Sunday morning and eat for 4 hours straight.  I can't give a raving review on Heist's brunch \"libations\" menu, as I've only tried one - the bottomless mimosa. Don't order that. Tastes like orange flavored water. Maybe try the bloody mary instead - I can't vouch for it, but it has to be better than the mimosas. When in doubt, just stick to the buffet!"}
{"text":"I had a surprise birthday beer bash here. They were so accommodating to set it up and reserved the entire upstairs \"loft\" for us. They even allowed me to bring a cake in.  It was our first time here. Our waiter was a little slow initially, maybe he was overwhelmed, but he finally got on. The ball. We ordered several apps - all the flatbreads (bruschetta, cheeseburger, and duck) and the pretzel braids with cheese dip. Unfortunately the food was just ok. I'm not a big beer drinker, but I did enjoy the Blonde Ale I ordered. Several of the guys ordered a flight of beer, which they had to ask for as it wasn't on the menu. Then they could ordered a pint of the one they preferred.   It was a fun party on a beautiful day! As we left, our waiter suggested we return for their brunch. This is actually what my friend said was spectacular, so we will definitely do that! I'd go back and enjoy a beer sometime but probably won't eat other than brunch!"}
{"text":"Going to keep this review brief..  We went to Heist on a Thursday night, there was a good size crowd so my boyfriend and I sat at a high top table. We each tried a few beers and they all had great flavor. The food is small plates/tapas style.. Definitely great for sharing. The man and I shared a flatbread made with duck and homemade root beer BBQ sauce, slider trio, and pretzels with beer cheese dip. Everything was delicious, fresh, and made from scratch. Definitely a great place to go with a group since it's open, loud, and almost everything on the menu is shareable!"}
{"text":"From out-of-town can't believe how good the food is almost like a five-star restaurant"}
{"text":"I love the beer and food here. The systems are correct and I don't have to worry about \"do I turn left or right?\" Definitely coming back when in north clack-a-lack"}
{"text":"This place was just OK.   Love the decor and atmosphere. I live in NYC and it made me feel at home. Service and food were meh. I asked for a taste of a beer and the waitress brought me a whole one, which I didn't really like but now felt obligated to drink. She would also disappear for long periods.    We got the hamburger flatbread, lamb meatballs and apple pie flatbread. Both flatbreads were just bad (how can you screw up apple pie?) but the meatballs were really good.   In short, come here for a fun drink with friends, but don't expect much else."}
{"text":"I've been to Heist on 3 separate occasions, twice for Live Music and once for the Lyft party, and each time I've left unimpressed.  The beer selection is ok, but every beer I've had has been pretty weak and boring.  The service in the dining area was slow and our waitress did not seem very happy to be there.  The back (or front?) bar area with live music this last time was a lot of fun, though, and we had excellent service from the bartender.  The Light Lager was still very bland."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very relaxed and they had a great late night menu selection. I'd love to come back during normal business hours to try out their full menu. I ordered the steak and potatoes and it was delicious! My friends ordered the beer cheese plate and chicken waffle tacos- both were also very good!"}
{"text":"Absolute best burger in Charlotte!  The beer cheese burger!  The burger is only available for lunch......not sure why...maybe we can start a petition to bring that hot slice of awesome to the dinner menu!  I regularly go and get the beer cheese burger and the vegetable soup for lunch...it is freakin awesome!"}
{"text":"Although I'm not a big craft beer drinker Heist has a really cool atmosphere-TVs, outdoor seating, and creative food presentations that are good to share!  Great addition to NoDa!"}
{"text":"Went to heist for their Sunday brunch buffet and was satisfied with everything.  The brunch buffet was $19 and included in al la carte item, moderately pricey but not crazy, especially for a brunch buffet.  The buffet was pretty decent the pork loin, flat bread being two of the best main dishes in my opinion.  The pork loin was cooked well and not dry at all for being under a heat lamp.  The flat bread where pretty good as well.  The best item on the buffet would be their rum grilled pineapple dessert though!! That was phenomenal!  For my al la crate item I got their spinach, chicken, mozzarella, and artichoke omelette,  that was pretty good as well.  For a beverage, the Pretty and Witty whit beer, I have had better and worse whit beer.    TLDR version: So overall 4 stars, nothing was absolutely amazing but everything was pretty good and I was satisfied with my experience.  I will try again in the future to sample more brews and something besides brunch."}
{"text":"Heist brunch is awesome! Great breakfast buffet filled with bacon ham and sausage. Grits were amazing and awesome add on entree. I'd definitely recommend you trying it out!"}
{"text":"Sunday buffet was expensive and a disappointment after all of the great things I've heard and read. There was no price listed for the brunch buffet on the website, but something I read said $16, and at that price we were disappointed. Then when we got our check and it was $19, we wished we had gone to Bistro LA Bon for $20. The food was average and the selection was odd. It's a great looking place with good music, but it was a little too loud and we couldn't hear each other talk."}
{"text":"Just mediocre.  Food is ok but overpriced.  Very limited beer list. Heist beer like their food is ok.  Service is worse.  Don't see a reason to return here"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Really love it. It can get a bit pricey for what you get, but I've never been disappointed by the flavor or the uniqueness of the items. My favorite is the seemingly simplistic Cheeseburger flatbread that is shockingly delicious. To me, their beer still leaves a bit to be desired even though they changed it up a while back. My friends said they came away really impressed by the IPA but since I am not a fan of IPAs right now, I could not say. I did not love the American Pale Ale, which they raved about. It was certainly drinkable though. The atmosphere is already great and the addition of the expanded patio really adds to it in making this overall a great place to take a date, dine with friends, or bring some out of town co-workers."}
{"text":"We went here for the third time last night. It was a Wednesday and there was no wait.  We usually have to stand around for 10-15 minutes to get a table, but not last night. Their food is worth the wait, though. I haven't gotten anything I didn't like.  Even our super picky daughter loved the fried chicken waffles.  The beer is excellent and always quick to arrive.  I highly recommend the beer cheese and pretzels because the dip is Amazing.  Also, the burger burger burger is AWESOME.  The flat breads and tacos are equally fabulous!  The parking was a challenge a couple of times.  One night we had to walk quite a distance from our car, but that just made us realize we needed to go during the week instead.  Heist is a wonderful place to eat. The service is great and the food is well worth the hour drive it takes us to get there."}
{"text":"I Love Heist! I am a HUGE fan of tapas. Every meal I have had at Heist has been great. Most recently I had their pork belly tacos which were the best thing ever! I also like their buffalo chicken flat bread and in the winter they have a toasted cheese with tomato soup shot and that is great as well. I think for the small portions you get it's a little too pricey. If they knocked the prices down a little on the tapas I think it would be better. I am not always a fan of their beer offerings. I recently had their summery beer and I liked that, but if there is nothing on the beer menu for me I will just get a cocktail. We had a group of 15 the last time we went and they did an AMAZING job with the service. I will definitely be going back to this place."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so much..but, to me, it is only so-so.   I've been for dinner and for brunch. Brunch is hit-or- miss. Service is always...okay. Beers have consistently disappointed.  Will give it another try or two before fully dismissing it."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is excellent!  The mimosas are weak, but I do love a bottomless mimosa special.  However, the food buffet completely overshadows this shortcoming.  Pretty pricey brunch bill, but the food is phenomenal.  Muscles, flat bread pizza, grits, quiche, biscuits and gravy, chicken wings.  Great combo of food on the buffet and it's all extremely tasty.  Service could have been better, it was not awful.  I will def go back to this place.  Be prepared to wait, the word is out on how good this place is.  There will be a wait."}
{"text":"This is a brewery located in NODA... Attached to a yummy pizza spot!  It's on the edge but walking distance to the majority of other places in NODA.  I wanted to note that I am basing this review off of our brunch experience, which was enjoyable!  We decided to hit up Sunday brunch to have a nice day date- because it was a nice day!  We chose to sit out on the front deck/patio area, which was a little walk to the food area (it's a buffet) but worth it to enjoy the weather.  So like I said, this was a brunch buffet.  You also get a menu where you get to choose one a-la-carte item.  I chose Shrimp and Grits, and my husband chose an omelet.  We both enjoyed these items!  The brunch had a variety of options, including juices.  I enjoyed bacon, potatoes, some pizzas, and some other random finds.  They also have a grilled pineapple which I tried- it was good and I guess soaked with alcohol!  A good treat to end your meal.    I really enjoyed our meal- but it was definitely expensive.  We will have to save a place like this for special occasions and celebrations because of the costs.  If it way maybe $5 less I feel like we could swing it more often.  I can't speak for any drinks or beer because we visited when I was pregnant.  But I will have to head back once I'm able to indulge a bit.  If you want a treat of a meal, and money is not an issue though it's mostly breakfast food- check it out!"}
{"text":"Love heist, such a great spot for brunch! When I went they were not very good at restocking the buffet though (flatbreads in particular). They seemed to always have a piece or 2 of 1 of the types of flatbreads at a time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. We went at about lunch time and it was kind of empty, but started to fill up while we were there. Very cool atmosphere, plenty of floor space. One thing I hated was that many of the tables have backless bar seats. Although its a brewery sitting on a backless barstool for a long period of time isn't all that comfortable. I quickly resolved this by switching for a stool that did have a back, but not sure if I could've switched so easily had the place been packed.  The waitress was a little slow (e.g. When bringing the check or getting something we asked for) considering how empty it was but she was so nice that it makes up for it. She really was attentive and took the time to help us decide on what we wanted.   My food was just ok, a little too crisp/crusty for my taste i guess. We had spinach and artichoke with flat bread, BBQ duck pizza and orange soda. The orange soda tasted like orange creamsicle, very good. The waitress told us that all products are made by the brewery. Items that were not made by the brewery were specified on the menu.  The bathroom is another thing that I liked. I felt like I'd stepped into a southwest spa or something, lol. It smelled of fresh wood and the decor was better than the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience at this place. Food took forever and was not good. Then when using the restroom it was absolutely disgusting. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is fantastic. Don't load up on the brunch all you can eat items. You also get to order off the menu. The steak and egg is highly recommended. The chicken and mac is great too. Bottomless mimosa- $12."}
{"text":"One of my friends from home moved to the Charlotte area about a year ago and suggested we meet at Heist for a quick dinner and catch-up session. It's one of her preferred local breweries, and she gave an excellent summation of their offerings.  Our server was on point and super friendly. I had a beer in front of me within minutes -- the top-tier Apricot Peach Pickin' -- and we ordered light dinner dishes as well. I selected the taquitos and it was perfectly proportioned to eat solo as a full meal or to share as an app.  The brewery itself is on the larger size, but it's broken into different rooms with two different bars and plenty of tables available. The restrooms are well kept and the parking lot is easy to navigate.  Overall, I enjoyed my snappy visit and would recommend it to others living in -- or visiting -- Charlotte."}
{"text":"I had the beer cheese Burger with Parmesan truffle fries. The burger was a decent burger and very messy. Good beer and bar food especially for a brewery."}
{"text":"I've lived in NoDa for years, and NEVER have I had a good experience at Heist.  The hipster barista wannabes behind the bar will ignore you for 30 minutes.  'Reserved' seating will always sit empty while you stand and wait for a normal table.  The $20 entrees would be appetizers at any other restaurant in Charlotte.  Stick to the pizza joint next door, Heist is terrible."}
{"text":"Dang! I was gonna fight Jared for the first reviewer badge, but we were both beaten.   Finally, Heist is open! The amount of work that has gone into each part of the brewery is unimaginable (to me anyway, who knows nothing about wood or granite work). The space itself is huge and well thought out. There's a bar in the front and another in the back. They serve not just their own beer, but also liquor for those unfortunate gluten free souls. Their menu is pretty great as well, not typical bar food at all. It was opening night, so I'll have to forgive them for not having pretzel sticks for my beer cheese (which was delicious). I heard great things about the chicken and waffles, the bacon wrapped tots, and flat bread. The presentation and aroma of all the dishes that passed by me were impressive. They served the bacon wrapped tots on small slabs of granite and the flat bread on custom carved wood platters.   Most importantly, the beer. I loved the I2PA - hoppy, complex goodness. And the second beer I had was damn good too...I ordered a red, but I swear it was a pale ale because my friend ordered the pale ale and got something that tasted like a red. So, I won out on that (probably) order mistake. In any case, I'll have to come back to be sure.   They'll have brunch offerings in a few weeks so I'll just have to be here all hours of the day.  Also, they played some tracks from my favorite band which I haven't heard played at any other establishment (besides a concert venue). Big props for good tunes."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in Charlotte!!! Had to use a star for parking (or lack there of) but the food makes your mouth water while eating it!!! They stay packed but get you seated quickly. So much food to choose from. I recommend starting with the Pizza Trail, then moving to the fresh foods (fruit and salad), then the buffet line. I recommend EVERYTHING only because the food line up changes often. My fav were the cheese steak sliders, shrimp & grits, and whatever they do to the pineapple is alright with me!!!! Can't wait for summer so i can sit on the patio and sip mimosas while enjoying brunch."}
{"text":"I went with a big group. Drinks are good food was just okay we had almost everything on the menu."}
{"text":"WOW!  Every time I come here I am impressed.  The location is easy to find right on North Davidson and has a huge parking lot that wraps around the side of the building.  The decor is barn wood and industry-chic.  The bar area is spacious and has tables as well as seats at the bar.  The bar itself is stacked with everything in case you are with a non-beer drinking friend.    The beer selection is huge compared to other breweries nearby.  There is something for everyone - I looove the IP2A.  Very smooth and still high ABV.  You can try a flight tho if you aren't sure what you would like.  The food is what really sets this brewery apart.  You can peak into the kitchen off the bar and see the chefs busily preparing orders.  Each menu item comes out of the kitchen as if it were a work of art!  I have personally had several items including various flatbreads and the pretzels with cheese sauce.  All of it fantastic.    The service has always been stellar whether you are in the bar or seated at a table.  There is a small patio out back too all set for summer time.  Love it here!"}
{"text":"Finally tried HB last night with friends.  The decor is really cool.  Loved the rustic look of the old brick and wood.   Almost immediately you can tell HB is much more than just a brewery.  Their cocktails are very good and creative.  Kind of odd that I only tied one beer in a brewery, but the ctails looked so amazing that I couldn't resist. As for the food, very impressive.  The menu is extremely creative and works for me.  The hard part was deciding which plates to try as they all look and sound delicious.To combat this we tried over half the menu.  Everything was very good with exception of the pork belly corn dogs (just didn't work for me-too much breading).  I especially loved the lobster bisque test tubes and the cheeseburger flatbread.  Finally, the service was fairly good considering how busy this place was.  Great place for larger groups."}
{"text":"I like Heist. The food is great. The fry basket is outstanding, flat breads are yummy and brunch is amazing. Beers rotate quite a bit and sometimes they run out of one type. They have a great cocktail list and some interesting beer drinks. I have not had bad service any of the 6 or so times I have gone. I have found all the staff to be friendly, often funny and genuine. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"The food was tapas style small plates. We had a group of 8 and the service was great. The drink selection was good with a cocktail menu, wine, and good beer selection. The plates are a bit overpriced. For tapas, I feel like they should have been $8-9/each. These were proved high for the size. Otherwise, good experience. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a food tour and this was one of the best stops. The chef prepared an amazing meal, so I'm sure many of the items on the menu are great. They brew their own beer in house, so there are great options there. They also carry some cocktails on tap which is great for non-beer drinkers. I'd definitely go back to Heist."}
{"text":"Great seasonal menu, awesome cocktails, chill patio with tv's, professional service and good beer."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Can't beat sitting outside on their deck on a nice day. Good price and selection of beer. Had the cheesy mac flat bread and split with a friend, good snack but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Great food, extremely mediocre beer. The three stars is a reflection of the food.  If I were rating the beer alone, I would have rated 1-2 star, and if on the food alone, 4-5 stars.  We sampled quite a few dishes:  The chicken&waffle sushi, the forked up tuna, the pork belly corn dogs, the torched diablos, and the jerk mango chipotle wings.  All of the dishes were excellent and beautifully presented.  The forked-up tuna was the star of these in my opinion.  The beer on the other hand was very uninspired.  I tried a flight of 5 beers (stout, brown porter, red, pale ale and the maibock) plus a pint of the Hefeweizen.  All were very bland, flat and lacked flavor across the board.  I would rate the brown porter as the best of the worst, but I would not recommend any of them.    Service was very friendly and attentive.  Shame the beer was the lone negative point."}
{"text":"Loving Heist.  They have it all.  They have a great menu and an awesome bar.  Then when you think you've seen it all, they have a huge brewery taproom.  #WhatWhat  Love this place.  We stopped in after a mother's day brunch.  Great servers and service.  Stephan, the man behind the bar, knew his stuff.  And, he was all about talking up the goodness of Heist Brews.    We thought we were coming in for a quicky drink, but we stayed and ate a wood fired pizza. #GoodTimes.   I enjoy the beers and the Bacon and Cheese Flatbread wood fired pizza is the stuff of legend.    I live the parking, bathrooms rock.  The price is decent.  The pizza was a bit small for $12 but after $3.75 Drafts, I'm golden.    Great service from Sky and Stefan"}
{"text":"Heist - everyone knows about Heist - fancy food and decent beer - that's the general feel I get from talking to others who have been there. As with most Charlotte Breweries, I have already tasted their beer prior to my visit. This was my last brewery in Charlotte that needed an \"official visit\".  The Brewery Restaurant complex that is Heist, is quite extensive. A large patio/outdoor seating, two bars and a main indoor dining area. My initial impression was that it felt very dark and cave like in here. There was a private party in one area, so we sat at the bar by the brewing tanks.  As I've already tried the majority of their beer, I settled on the closest thing they have to an IPA which is their San Fran Disco, a hoppy American Ale - it was drinkable and refreshing but nothing spectacular.   Our bartender was not friendly at all - she was \"short\" with us and didn't really seem like she felt being at work. She was all business and wanted to get the \"job\" done and move on. When I asked questions, she answered so quickly, it felt like she couldn't be bothered.  While sitting at the bar another server/bartender (?), tall and blonde, helped an AA family waiting for their table with drinks; the server was really very rude to them. Yes, they ordered 4 Sprites but that shouldn't matter. She filled them all with the soda hose, dripping soda everywhere and almost slammed them on the bar. \"Here you are, four Sprites!\" she sneered. I couldn't believe the family didn't say anything - I certainly would have and almost did on their behalf. So A) the server was having a bad day and took it out on the customers B) she is rude all the time and shouldn't be a server C) she felt like the customers were being cheap and refer back to A or B - D) she doesn't respect people of other colors. The whole \"sour\" staff ruined the experience for me. Maybe it was \"bring your personal baggage to work day\". I don't care if your beer and food is just okay or awesome. If your staff doesn't represent your product well, no one will buy it.  All the pictures I've ever seen of their food look awesome. I would probably be more likely to come back here for dinner than for the beer next time.  Going to round up to 3 stars as I try not to be \"that guy who's trying to wreck a business\". The staff members I encountered were 2 star and 1 star."}
{"text":"The only heist here is what happens to your wallet.   01 // The \"beer\" is watered down.  02 // This place is more a restaurant than brewery. Not my kind of restaurant at that. Go somewhere else first.  03 // Expect high prices and little portions of food.  04 // You can't just \"sit at the bar.\" They want to serve you at a table like a restaurant."}
{"text":"Ignore all of the old reviews of Heist that you might come across. They are woefully inaccurate. SInce finding a new brewmaster and chef a while back, Heist has become a force to reckon with in the Charlotte beer scene.   If you're a fan of IPAs, Heist easily has the best in Charlotte. Their New England, cloudy, citrusy IPAs put all others in the Charlotte area to shame. It's not just IPAs either. Heist makes great beer all around, and there's usually a wide enough variety on tap to satisfy any beer drinker. In addition to all of the great beers, Heist has some great cocktails and an excellent selection of spirits.   The food at Heist is also fantastic. They do small plates, and I haven't had anything that wasn't excellent. I love the beer cheese (actual beer cheese...not a runny cup of sadness like you'll find at certain other breweries) and flatbreads in particular.   To top things off, the service is always superb. From the host or hostess to the waitstaff and bartenders, all of the Heist employees I've met have been friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. If you're worried about finding a spot, they'll take reservations.   If it's been over a year since you've been to Heist, you really need to go back!"}
{"text":"THE BEST BRUNCH... if I had to choose where to go to brunch everyday, I would choose Heist. Cost may be a bit high but is 100% worth the fresh and hot buffet they offer. The brunch menu is excellent and food is delicious."}
{"text":"Good beers and bites.  We were In town for the Belk Bowl and this was the only brewery open at 11:30 since all the others did not open until 4 and the game started at 5:30. We ordered the flatbread with basil on it and asked if they could put fresh basil and to my surprise the flat bread came out covered in fresh greens. It was good. We also tried the wings and they were ginormous. I tried a cocktail and that too was good. If this place had been closer to the stadium we probably would've gone here to tailgate but it's on the other side of town it seems from our drive."}
{"text":"Food is great here - love the smoked wings. For some reason they cannot get the service part right. I've been here 3x and all 3x service has been an issue.  Takes forever to get anyone to wait on you or have food delivered to the table."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time for Sunday brunch, loved the buffet and quick service! Great vibes."}
{"text":"Everyone raved about this place before I tried it myself. I liked the atmosphere very much. The drinks were great! The pear martini was SO good!  The food on the other hand was just ok. I like the totchoes (sp) a lot. They were very interesting and quite delicious.  The pretzels with beer cheese was was just okay. We also ordered the chicken wing - and it was also just okay. The pizza flatbread was pretty good but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"I was expecting more of a brewery. This is more of a causal eatery with beer.. I would come back but it wouldn't be on my \"brewery\" list.."}
{"text":"4 stars based on the service and atmosphere.  I absolutely love the interior of this place.  Very shaby chic and trendy at the same time.  We popped in for a quick beer the other night and this place was completely packed out!  That's a good sign.    I tried the local IPA brewed there and while it was completely drinkable I wasn't overly in love with it.  Maybe that will grow on me.  The food being delivered to the tables around us looked great and for that reason alone I will have to go back and give the food a go!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Heist Brewery three times now and have brought others from Chicago.  Everyone liked the place- but they liked it for the food.  I think the food is good.  My wife and I like the wings and the tater tots.  I could seriously eat about 30 in one sitting if I were allowed.  The tots are really good.  I've had nearly everything on the appetizer menu and have been thrilled with almost all of it.  The beer, well for a brewery, the beer just isn't all that great.  I've tried a couple of flights of beers on different trips.  Both have been disappointments.  I drink it because I'm at a brewery, so its what you're supposed to do but they aren't all that good.  The Heist offers sodas that they brew as well.  My wife tried the orange soda- average at best.  The atmosphere is cool though and each time.  The service has been great each time as well.  I'm happy with the food.  I'm disappointed with the lack of flavor in the beer.  Its a neat place though in a cool neighborhood."}
{"text":"I tried Heist after reading a review/article in Elevate Magazine and it didn't disappoint!    My first thought when I walked inside was \"WOW, this place is beautiful!\" The wood-lined walls are rich and inviting and yet, laid-back.  The vats located behind the clear glass is strangely comforting, as they are beautiful to look at (who doesn't love giant copper beer vats?) and cool to know that you will be drinking a local made brew.    The food was unique and tasty, but really the beer was what I keep coming back for.  I know it sounds especially girly (yes, I'm a girl, but I'm usually a fan of pale ales and IPA's), but I loved their seasonal Strawberry Ale.  It wasn't as heavy as a lambic, but refreshing and just a hint of fruit.  Not sweet-just refreshed my palate and led me to drink another....And another :-)"}
{"text":"Genuinely surprised at all the good reviews on here, after telling friends and fam about my verbal review I wanted to make it official on Yelp. The beer was awful, I had been told by many people on the beer culture of Charlotte that it was but I had to find out for myself. I have a deep rooted love for Noda Brewery, Birdsong and a high respect for Triple C and Old Meck, and Heist's beer makes our town's brewers look bad. Food was good, tasty, and impressive, but I got only four of the Parmesan Garlic Tator Tots. Note to owners, no one who orders Tots wants only four, regardless of quality. I rarely write negative reviews, so here is more good: service, top notch. Decor, lovely. Sorry, back to negative: pricey, a bit pretentious and how do you screw up a red ale? I'm a homebrewer, that style might as well be training wheels! I'd go back if I were with work people who didnt like beer and were paying for the food. Otherwise, I'm getting a better burger at Jack Beagles down the street with a better beer to boot, then going to Noda brewery for the real draft."}
{"text":"I like the place but it's not a place I would frequent often because I like my go-to bars to be a little less pricey.  FOOD: I felt like although they were going for the whole tapas type of food vibe, the portions were pretty small for the price. On another note, I do think it's a nice place for a casual date because the food presentation is just beautiful. My favorite are the flat breads! YUM!  SERVICE: No complaints, very friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"Pros:  cool building, nice view of the brewing equipment  Cons:  beer is mediocre at best.. Tastes watered down, food is way overpriced, and the shrimp mousse appetizer thing is horrendous... I mean disgusting.  The chefs creations remind me of the crap I see on Gordon Ramsays kitchen nightmares where the chef gets excited with weird flavor combinations that don't jive... Plus bizarre glasses and food holders that are just annoying.    I will not return.  There's no value here."}
{"text":"Pretty cool restaurant. They had a small parking lot with tiny spaces lol so if you have a big car you literally won't fit. So I came in for brunch on a Sunday and this review is only based on the brunch. The staff were patient and flexible meet our needs. We had a large party of 8. They sat us in the middle area but there were several seating options - small room in the back more intimate, outside which is nice on a beautiful, and or a front area. There was an upstairs location but I don't think it was open during brunch. They had several televisions and even sold clothes with the restaurant/ brewery name. The food was good where jt was buffet style with several different areas where the food was located. The food hit the spot. It wasn't the best food o have ever tasted but it worked well after a long night. The brunch has an a la cart item you can choose from and it was delivered in addition to your buffet plate. I got the shrimp and grits which was basically the same grits and shrimp from the buffet section put together. The mimosa pitcher was a nice.  The restrooms were clean. The server was able to ring us up separately. The server did forget a few items, and we had to ask a few times but it may have been due to the busy time that we were there. He was nice and tried really hard. This place has an urban electric feel that I really enjoyed and appreciate. It was different and charlotte needs different. Overall I enjoyed the people I was with and my time there. I am interested to see what it would be like in the evening or on a week day. So far so good."}
{"text":"Delicous tap beers. Staff is frindly and fast. If your in the area you definetly need to stop by and check it out. Ordered their bbq burger and it was absoltely delicious"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the Facebook hype they've been building over the last few months before opening. The beer was impressive not for being \"out-there,\" but for being solid and well-crafted. It's like they are trying to get it \"right\" before they get fancy. I had a pale ale and it was excellent. My wife's hefeweizen was also good. While the beers were solid and a bit conservative, the food is crazy and complex. The beer cheese had a lot of tastes going on. I was happy it came with a little spoon that I used to scrape the last of the cheese from the bowl after the pretzels were gone. The chicken and waffles were simply indescribable. They come like little sushi rolls and I scarfed them down.  I'll just say \"horseradish maple syrup\" and leave it at that. The presentation was also a plus. We ended up spending a lot of time watching everyone else's food arrive on wooden carving boards and chunks of marble.  Is it a little pricey? Yes, but I've paid much more for less tasty food in a worse atmosphere. Well done Heist. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I went to Heist for dinner and beer a few months ago.  I really wanted to be a fan of Heist since it is in my hood, but dinner was nothing special.  In fact, it wasn't good.  The food left a lot to be desired, and the beer was just gross.  HOWEVER....the brunch here is AMAZING!! The food is so unique and flavorful.  It's buffet style, and there are lots of options to include a waffle bar.  I've been three times, and usually I don't even eat any other meal during the day after this super satisfying feast.  The coffee is ok.  I had to drink my coffee out of a beer glass which was kind of weird but the coffee still made it to the party."}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying that I consider myself to be a bit of a brunch aficionado. I love a good brunch spot and I've been to them all. I was so excited to check out Heist because I had heard good things. First of all, brunch is $19.99 per person. Yikes!  Pretty spendy, but I thought it must be great to make them charge so much. Wrong. The food is cold and under seasoned. I don't know if they ran out of salt and pepper in the kitchen, but everything was terribly bland: eggs, mac and cheese, quiche, salad, etc.  Even the waffles, which you have to order from the waiter arrived cold. This place is not worth the money and with so many amazing brunch spots competing for your business in Charlotte, go ahead and skip this one. You're not missing anything."}
{"text":"We showed up for Sunday brunch with a party of 14 and 4 kids under the age the age of two. The front desk called in Spencer and he made it happen for us with out any wait. They put us in the back room near the stage which was perfect for the kids to play on for a few minutes.  Travis gave us amazing service and never batted an eye at the chaos we brought into the place. Oh yeah, not to mention that the food was unreal and the bloody mary's and mimosas ( that we drank before noon on a Sunday ) were top notch. We got the personal service that lacks most chains and other establishments and that makes all the difference. Thanks again and we will 100% be back again soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breweries in town.  Their beer selection is good and their food is amazing.  They have a run club on Monday nights at 6 pm.  They're a great group of people!  Definitely, check out this brewery."}
{"text":"Love love love Heist. Amazing beer- one of the only places I've seen do a perfect small batch of strawberry beer. The small plates are killer and I adore the goat cheese they put in those decorative tubes. I think this brewery is a must visit even if you don't drink beer!"}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect going to this brewery, maybe just typical pub food. But after looking at the menu and the drink menu, I knew Heist was far from typical. I mean come on, has you ever seen a Brewery that makes Beer Cocktails, because I haven't. I will say though that I was a fan not only of the beer cocktail I tried, but also their cocktail as well, the Asian Pear was delicious! The only downside is that I couldn't afford to try more cocktails :(  The menu was very diverse and interesting, but as soon as I saw Lobster Mac and Cheese I had to try it! It was delicious. We also got the Southern Comfort Chicken that was served in a mason jar, both delicious and cute! Finally we tried the salmon belly tacos, which were very tasty. All in all a very great meal! I will definitely be returning as there were many other things I wanted to try. However, my next stop will be for brunch, which sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"We're glad to have you, Heist! Anything making this city start to compete with our beloved neighbor, Ashvegas, I am totally for.  I don't know  how your food is and look forward to trying it, but I did meander in a few months ago and have some brews and they were OK. Perhaps I thought based on your awesome interior, decor, and easy parking that you were going to be like NoDa Brewing but even better. But I think this is a case of you focusing on too much to do anything super great.   Beer and food - a beautiful relationship, no? But each needs to be an individual. And even beers, while so related, need to stand on their own, but on my flight there was only a red ale that stood out. The others tasted like the same base week with a drop of flavoring in them. 3 beers with fruit? Come on, I can barely drink OJ so I'm not trying to have Peach in my Hefeweizen. 9 total beers to choose from? Why don't you just try 3 and make them amazing and have 1 additional as a trial batch? Seems like you could really make something great if you focused and whittled down your variety!  As I said, looking forward to trying the food. Perhaps the brews will have totally changed in the 2 months since I've been too? I hope so!"}
{"text":"For the big 1000th review, I have to review Heist Brewery, a fairly new brewery in a place called NoDa (North Davidson) that I visited last week. My friend's loft is steps away from HB, and it is definitley a good and bad thing. Great since you can go anytime, have a great time, and walk back home, bad, I would definitley spend way too much money and pack on a ton of calories at this place!  Thursday evening, we had a table right next to the bar, so very convenient. It was a special night, as they were unveiling the beer tap handles. Professional photos were being taken, some delicious hor dourves available, and felt like I was in a monumental moment as people were purchasing glasses of beer as people cheered on.   This place is a lot larger than I had expected, as there's a huge area beyond the front bar. There, you can see the brewery through glass, and it's a large open space of tables and bar tables.  I was introduced to the Moscow Mule, a Russian version of a margarita. It's also poured in these copper (or silver) mugs that keep the drink extra cold the entire time. It was AMAZING! Very addicting, as it's not super strong. The ginger beer was refreshing, especially with the lime provided. I could've drank these all night, and only $9!  We shared a bunch of appetizers, which they have a lot of unique combinations plus your typical bar fare with a twist (strawberry bun anyone?). My favorite by far, was my local friends' favorites as well, the 6 cheese pimento and sherried crab dip. Delicious, especially with the parmesean flatbread provided! I could not stop eating it! Their spinach and artichoke dip was just as good as well! I ordered the jerked chicken flatbread pizza, which was good, but I'd have to say the root beer BBQ duck pizza was even better! We also got the forked-up ahi, which also came with a wasabi soy mist in a mini bottle! How clever is that?   Great ambience of locals dining and drinking, and definitley had a great night here that ended my trip quite nicely. Would definitley recommend this place and feel like one of the locals in the trendy NoDa area!"}
{"text":"My decent Sunday brunch was overshadowed by the EXTREMELY unfriendly hostess (petite brunette woman) who was SO rude I had to tell \"you should be friendlier to your guests\". Good food, rude worker ruined the experience though."}
{"text":"Visiting family near Charlotte. I am an avid taproom / brewpub visitor. Favourite thing to do when going to a new city. I was excited to try out Heist in NoDa (which I had no idea what NoDa was but it is a cute area).  I really wanted to give 5 stars :(  I'll start with the worst and end with the best.  Food: I ordered the Cheddar Bacon Burger with the Parmesan Truffle Fries. Can't go wrong with a burger and beer right? Well..... The burger was rather bland. Kind of disappointing. Also, there was no bottom bunk! I searched and searched. Told the waiter and he went to find out what happened. \"They were running out of buns...\" What?? Let someone know about that before hand, don't just bring someone a burger with one bun on top and call it a day! I mean, really?? The fried tasted like they were just popped out of the freezer. Nothing special about them at all and did not taste fresh whatsoever. Definitely would not come back for the food.  Beer: I only had the opportunity to try one and I tried Brockwell. It definitely had some character. But to me it wasn't very smooth, almost acidic tasting. Roasted is in the description and that is definitely true- you get a roasted flavour to it. (Not saying that is bad, I actually like a good roast so they were spot on). Was this my favorite? No. I would try something else if ever I get the chance to go back to Heist.  Now the best parts!  Building: I love the inside. It is spacious with upstairs and downstairs seating and HUGE open space that is still cozy and community-like.  Service: Our waiter was very nice and attentive. We let him know we were in a hurry (had to get the dogs from the groomers before they closed ) and he had our orders out so quickly! Additionally, he was very transparent with what happened with my burger. I appreciated that and it didn't go unnoticed.  Would I return? Yes. But only to try a different beer, the ambiance and for the friendly service."}
{"text":"What an unpleasant experience...Birdsong not open yet so I came across this place...totally uninterested and surly barmaids, obviously not interested in serving a new customer....one tells me the beers, I ask for a sample, she walks off...another serves the sample, I order a pint for me and my friend from Texas, she tells me she can't serve me two beers at once per state law...I take my beer outside to the table and then return for his beer...what BS...start a tab? Nope, we finished those subpar beers and left...needless to say no tip and won't be back...apparently you have enough patrons who aren't treated this way or put up with it...on to Divine Barrel for a   5 star experience...Heist is aptly named; glad to see others have also had a bad experience here so it's not just me...hey Heist: without customers you don't exist. Plenty of great breweries in CLT, you ain't one of them."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times, but I've never written a review.  I'm never disappointed with their beer or liquor selection.  This brewery is my favorite one in all of Charlotte.  I'm not too sure about the quality of the wait staff because I only sit at the bar where a certain bartender is working.  He's was there the very first time I visited this brewery (few years ago) and he's still there.  Stefan knows how and when the time is appropriate to entertain patrons.    The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I wasn't gung-ho about their food.  To be fair, it may not have been my style.  Other people I've been with seem to love it, but not I."}
{"text":"Charlotte is a hell of a beer city, and as of today there's more than two dozen mini breweries in Charlotte. Personally, I like this brewpub more than any of the ones I've been to.  And here's a recipe for a perfect Sunday funday: After your extra hour of sleep (it's Sunday, after all), come here for the most ~magical~ meal of the week and enjoy delicious brunch buffet with friends.   As of now, Heist offer great booze and great food. Later, they'll open a butcher shop, bake shop, and an event shop. Try the duck confit flatbread and few of their seasonal beer rotations. Pizza and beer: great combo. That's why Heist has became one of my go-to spots.   Addition notes: Yoga: Monday6pm for $10 with Free beer.  Sunday brunch buffet ($19): - All-you-can-eat options. - Rotating a la carte menu. - Waffle station. - $5 bloody marys or $12 mimosa carafes.   Keep in mind that Heist don't take reservation.  Five Yelps."}
{"text":"Great location. Good food.  TERRIBLE service.  Been here twice and both times staff standing around and  nobody being helped.  Sat for 8 min without anyone coming to table    Ordered beer that came from back even though sitting 3 ft from bar with bartender doing nothing.  App came same time as food.   28 minutes to get an app!  Seriously.  Also, they don't serve fries.  They have homemade tots which were interesting but undone."}
{"text":"I give four stars for combined atmosphere and food. Very laid back flow, space for sitting outside with pets or your favorite people  Standing ovation style at the bar is another option. We opted for table seating inside with the cool view of the brew machines which was pretty cool.  Shared plates concept is the flow for food, portions perfect for a group of four. We tried the Duck Confit Salad, Pork Belly Tacos, and the Burger Burger Burger Sliders. Salad and burgers were very tasty and well put together. The Pork tacos needed more flavor. Finished off the meal with the Bread Pudding with Jack Daniels sauce. Yeah sounds good but taste and execution not that great. Sliced pieces of bread with sauce lightly drizzled over. Had to ask for extra sauce to help the rather dry pudding representation. Plan to visit again to try other interesting menu items. Hive 5 Beer was delicious"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  Went on a Wednesday night in summer, around 8 for dinner.  Just three of us. We walked in to ask for a seat on the deck, was told 'no problem, just sit anywhere'.  So we did.   10 minutes later the server arrives. 3 beers and a water. About 10 minutes later for the beers. Another 10 minutes for the water, which I found extremely odd as you don't need to wait for the bar staff to pour a glass of water.   Finally get our order in about 30 minutes after being seated.   My table mates finished their beers but no sign of our waitress. After about 20 minutes from when we gave our order, my friend gets up to search out some beverages. While inside he finds our waitress who tells him that they ran out of one of the entrees we ordered. 20 minutes AFTER we ordered.   To recap till just now: we've been there for close to an hour, have been served one beverage and had to seek out the waitress to find out they were out of something we ordered 20 minutes ago.   The waitress very half heartedly apologizes and says she'll ask the kitchen to rush a second burger. Rushing the cooking of meat is not something I'd usually hear a restaurant say they'd do.   Another 10-15 minutes for the first two entrees to be brought out. Another 10 for the last one.   To their credit the burger was good. The rosemary tater tots were fried in too low heat, they were greasy, not crispy.   But I can't get over the terrible service and will not be back. There are too many good restaurants in Charlotte and especially in NoDa to settle on this level of service.  It shouldn't take two hours plus hours for burgers and beers.  Tip to the server: don't keep your patrons waiting for beer and be upfront on what's been sold out (it should not take 20 minutes for that info to reach the customer!). Not being proactive on either account is just unprofessional."}
{"text":"A friend decided to try Heist for a brunch get together. I was not familiar with their brunch set up and imagined a typical brunch menu. We were told we could eat at the buffet and order one entrée from their brunch menu. It wasn't until I started reading the reviews on Yelp that I even knew they had an omelet and waffle station... Our waitress seemed to have a slight attitude ... she didn't notify us, well at least my section of the table (there were around 12 of us )  of additional stations. When our table asked for clarification of entrees  on the menu she had even more of an attitude. I can't find the brunch menu online so I will do my best to describe my entree. It was a layer of French fires, a short rib, egg and then white bbq sauce layered in a bowl. It wasn't clear that this would all come in one bowl and essentially mixed together so when I read the description of the fried egg I asked to have it scrambled. The waitress then told me she can't guarantee that they can scrambled it ... to which I asked her if she could go ask .. instead of telling me she can't guarantee it.  My friends ordered Mimosa's and felt as if they weren't coming frequently enough for the price. Another friend ordered an entrée without pork and then even asked the server when he dropped it off if it had pork twice and he said no ... the dish had pork in it. Another friend waited almost 30 mins to receive her food. That was her last straw with the service we received so we asked to speak to manager. Everybody in our party which included around 12 people received half off our bill. Now granted we were a large party and some people came in almost 30 mins after our original start time , I think that the service could have been better. I'm glad that the manager rectified the situation , but I don't know if I would go back from brunch.   On a positive note the buffet was pretty good but it would have been nice to know that I could have gotten an omelet and waffle. I would like to try their lunch menu that looks way more appetizing than what I had for brunch."}
{"text":"For 19 dollars you get cold food. The al la cart food was a joke. The shrimp and grits can in a small cup 1/3 filled with undercooked grits and no shrimp. The Benny was a sunny side up get on a Texas toast that was burned. Don't know where the hollandaise sauce went. The pizzas are dried out and cold. My first cup of coffee was cold and probably made the night before. Quality control personnel went by n vacation. Worst food ever. Not worth even a dollar, and they charged us 19. What a joke."}
{"text":"Different type of atmosphere and layout, but I like it. I met a friend here to watch the Panthers game.  Our table was a bit out in \"no man's land,\" and it felt a bit isolated, but I like the place.  I had the veggie burger that came on a bed of warm kale and some other veggies.  All in all, not bad.  The wait staff was good as well and even though it was game night, we got a table pretty quickly.  Good food.  Good company.  And NoDa.  You can't really go wrong with that."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that also makes beer not a brewery that serves food. First impression was a very industrial look. We went on a Sunday after brunch so the menu was not all available due to the change over from brunch. No big deal we got a flat bread and some beer cheese dip. Both were very good and plenty for two people. Our waitress was very attentive and nice.  On to the beer, we both got a flight to try as many of the beers as we could. We have been to all the other breweries in town and were hopeful this would measure up to those. Not even close! All of the beers tasted like they had been watered down. This place has been around a year give or take a few months so I would think they would have  a few beers coming out perfect by now. But that is not the case, the hefeweizen was light with hardly any banana, the peach hefe was the same but with a hint of peach. The stout was ok but again weak in flavor. The double iPa was more like a regular iPa usually a double will be a little sweeter than an iPa but with a malt flavor not just hops. The amber tasted like water I think it might of just been water and red food coloring. So after the beer I would say go for the food but just skip the beer."}
{"text":"They put way too much ice in their cocktails...$11 for a drink and the ice was filled to the top in one drink and crushed ice in the other. I bet I had about 5 sips of actual drink..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The inside is decorated with the coolest artwork and the setup is very cool. I sat at the bar and Stephan, the bar manager, was fantastic. I just came in to have a couple cocktails so I can't say anything about the food. I tried three drinks   Pecan smoked whiskey: They set wood chips on fire and let the glass trap the smoke! It's so freaking manly and cool! I prefer my drinks less strong though so I give it a 3/5.   Ginger Whiskey sour: eh. I ordered it because I thought it was going to taste like ginger. It didn't really though.   Burning Leaves: Best drink hands down I had in Charlotte. Totally recommend it. 5/5  I will definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"NoDa is famed in the Charlotte area for its local dives and great restaurants + brewery's.   The atmosphere in this place is something run-down and beautiful, there is character and charm, like the rest of NoDa. Vaulted ceilings make the place seem more open airy, and the brick walls add more warmth.   As for the food, excellent, we came in on an off time  (3pm) and it came out fast.  We ordered 3x appetizers, wings, duck confit flatbread, and a spinach artichoke dip. All were extremely good and not over seasoned like my fear of most restaurants.   Everything about this review seems great.   Except for the service. Like stated above- this was an off time for the brewery.  Being a manager at a restaurant, I understand understaffing during off hours- and what not. In total number of customers, there were 9 people in the house.  I waited 15 minutes to be seated.  Tables were left dirty.  Waited another 10 minutes to have water brought to my table.  Then another 15 for my waitress to come and take my order. (At this point the waitress saw me take my keys and I was about to leave, and she just so happened to serve me)   40 minutes to place my order at 3pm.  My father who took me here said this has never happened before. And he was appalled at how terrible this was.   I'll come back again, and update this review- because I believe in the food and the beer was great. I was just so disappointed with the service, I'll come back with in a month."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place! Why? Because it's a brewery, and I'm not a big beer drinker! The food here is awesome! We visited on a Friday evening around 7. The place was practically empty on the inside. The patio is where the action is. However, it started to fill in quite quickly as we got into our meal. I had the Burger Burger Burger...awesome! The goat cheese paired with their tangy sauce makes it a hit. The wife had the Duck Confit flatbread. It was great! The wife had a flight of bourbon whisky which was really good. The service was top notch. Our waiter was very attentive. Everyone was so professional. I'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I got the flight of beers. I really liked 4, less than liked one but all and all it was a success. My favorite was definitely the pumpkin, not so much of a pumpkin flavor but more of a spice :) service was quick and nice!"}
{"text":"On Memorial Day stopped into Heist Brewery for lunch and some beers. For food we ordered the Beer Cheese and the BBQ Burger, and for drinks we made our way through two Flights.  Quality Heist Brewery is a unique place, because despite being a brewery, that doesn't seem to define their identity. They feel like a full service restaurant and pub that also happens to brew up some beers. We easily were able to try the ten beers on draft, two of which were guest taps. On this afternoon it was \"Hive\" Fives, Blurred Is The Word, Room For Activities, Not From Concentrate, Now Trending Blackberry Pick'n, Uberquench'l, Average Joe, and then the two guest choices Good Road Blue Byway and Deep River 4042. Despite being a small selection, each beer I tried was solid. My favorite would have to be Not From Concentrate, a delicious hazy IPA with a wonderful fruit flavor. I also was partial to Blurred Is The Word, another fun IPA. And while I didn't dislike any beers, my least favorite was Blackberry Pick'n, a wheat beer that was extremely tart. Along with the beers we also took advantage of the kitchen, first with the Beer Cheese. It is a bowl of cheesy deliciousness that is paired up with some pretzels. The cheese itself uses beer along with white cheddar, cream cheese, and a mozzarella provolone blend. Excellent, as long as you have some calories to spare. We also ordered the BBQ Burger, which was just alright. The patty itself was great with a mix of brisket, porterhouse tail, and chuck, but for some reason the rest of the toppings, bacon jam, goat cheese, arugula, tomatoes, and bbq sauce did not work for me.  Quantity Flights came with five samples, which was a little annoying since they only had ten beers total on tap, of which only eight were their beers. For food the Beer Cheese is heavy and filling, definitely a dish to share amongst a group. The burger was on the smaller size, but with the side of fries it is more than enough for lunch.  Value I believe the flights cost $7 or $8, which is a solid price for five samplers. The lunch menu was also very affordable, with nothing on the menu listed for more than $14.  Ambiance Heist Brewery is found in the NoDa area a little north of Charlotte. The space itself is massive and if not for the displayed tanks in the back room could easily be confused for any other bar. In front of the building they have a good sized outdoor patio with several tables and picnic benches. The inside space is split into three areas. The main door opens up into the first large dining area. This room is defined by its massive bar displaying not only the beer tap, but hundreds of liquor bottles. We were seated in the other large room that is further back. Here the highlight is the views of the beer tanks and the massive screens on the wall. They have multiple screens throughout the space making it a good place to watch a game. The brewery also has an upstairs area, which I assume is for private parties. I do want to highlight that I loved the music selection. The perfect mix of electronic, rock, and dance songs to keep your head bobbing at all times.  Crowd Being that we had a flight to catch in the early afternoon, we were some of the first to arrive at the brewery. However, around noon a solid lunch crowd had begun to form. And while coffee and mimosas seemed like the more popular choice, we were far from the only ones grabbing an early beer. I would imagine that on weekend afternoons and evenings, as well as happy hour, that this place really fills up.  Service Our server was friendly, but clearly was hit hard by the holiday weekend. She needed several reminders for things we asked for, as the coffee didn't have her going at full steam yet. But they had plenty of other servers in tow, presumably expecting a holiday weekend crowd, who helped lighten the load.   Parking We did not have a car during our visit so we did not have to deal with parking. However, it appeared they had a small private lot, but one unlikely to be able to handle the crowd on a busy day.  Extra Heist Brewery is definitely more than just a brewery. While they brew some solid beers, though I wish they had a few more, they also have quality food and a fun space to brunch or watch a game. Clearly a hangout spot, which I'm sure fills up fast after work and on weekend afternoons and evenings."}
{"text":"Add this to the list of places whose menu descriptions sound way better than what actually shows up. They're in the club with Cowfish and Bebo's. Every single small plate sounds like it's going to be the best thing you've ever eaten.   On our most recent visit, we ordered Steak'N'Taters (marinated flank steak! truffled parmesan! potato cracklins! red wine demi glaze!), Chicken Waffle Tacos (sriracha chicken! hot sauce butter! maple syrup!), and Sweet and Spicy Flatbreads (roasted peaches! pickled jalapeños! pineapple glaze!) Sounds amazing, right? What actually showed up were three small plates of under seasoned, un-inspired food. All edible but all disappointing.   I've never been a fan of Heist's beer, either. When they first opened years and years ago, the beer was just plain awful. Ted tells me they make really good IPAs now, but I don't drink IPAs, soooooo... Again, on our most recent visit, they had about 6 IPAs, a pale ale and a barley wine on draft. I went with the guest tap cider. It was fine but as seems to be par for the course at Heist, pretty underwhelming."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Heist Brewery, I came on a Saturday afternoon with a friend. We grabbed a seat at the bar, It wasn't crowded. Parking was a pain. I would recommend parking further down the street and walking. We sampled a few beers before ordering.   I tried the Blackberry Pick'n and the Good Road Blue ByWay. Both were great options! I liked the tart flavor of the Blackberry Pick'n and the blueberry cider flavor of the Good Road Blue ByWay. Heist Brewing also offers food. As we were leaving there was live music outdoors."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner - food was alright.  Nothing extraordinary.  Drinks were yummy!  Our server is the main reason for the lowered rating - she was rude from the moment we were seated until we left.  She had no patience for us when we needed time to actually look at the menu, when a friend joined us she was short with him.  The 'entertainment' of the evening asked for a jack & coke in between one of his songs, and she just gave him a nasty look before saying \"okay.\" - then came back and just set the drink (that was for the band) on our table and walked off without saying a word.  We had to deliver the drink to the band.  When it was finally time to pay she started to just clear off the table without asking if we were finished - she even took my friend's beer that was still about half full that he was not finishing drinking.  She'd for sure benefit from some customer service training."}
{"text":"Great selection of food, beers and cocktails. The decor and vibe is really nice. They have a great outdoor space and huge indoor space. Tried the pretzel bites which were okay but would return to try other foods/drinks."}
{"text":"We have been here on multiple occasions. One thing that is always consistent is the beer cheese! We've had some hit and miss experiences as well especially with brunch. But since they have gotten their new chef, we have nothing but great things to say!"}
{"text":"The pipe smoked salmon is absolutely delicious. The fish and rosemary tots were also wonderful."}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere for a large birthday party celebration with 14 people, however the kids' choices are extremely limited. The adult food was fabulous, but our kids had 2 choices & their chicken tenders came fried almost black! The cheese pizza was fine. We ordered more tarot tots to fill them & they came badly over fried also. Very disappointing. We have taken them to brunch on Sundays and they loved that. May not go back for dinner with children."}
{"text":"Service was very good. Beer was too. Food was great too.  We celebrated my birthday there and left in a great mood."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this is a Brewery.  Therefore the beer receives high consideration.  Our party of four tried several different beers, none of which were very good.  I know this place is new so maybe they are still working out the kinks. But they have a long way to go.  Descriptive adjectives about the beer from our table - \"flat\", \"watery\" and \"this is a bad beer\".  Ouch!   In related news, even the tap water they serve had a very metallic taste. So maybe it's something related to the originally industrial water source?    Food - they have an eclectic and creative menu.  Unfortunately the execution of certain dishes was lacking.  The pretzel sticks with beer cheese are good for a group, but a far cry from real Bavarian style pretzels in flavor and texture.  The chicken and waffle sushi was the biggest hit with our party.  Not a lot of food but an original and creative dish all the same - great for four people to each get a sweet savory bite.  The Caesar salad was delicious and well-presented.  With lightly grilled romaine, fried anchovies and toasted pumpkin seeds, this one's a winner.  We also tried the little corndogs - good flavor, not a lot of food, needed another minute in the fryer.  But, overall, I thought the food was pretty durn good.    Other observations - I liked the space/decor (lots of cool ganster prints and big open spaces).  There are 3 or 4 bars, we were in the main room overlooking the copper beer thing-ys (vats?) and it was pretty chill.  I liked the music playing - think Black Keys, even some old Portishead, sort of grungy, bluesy rock -  it fits the space.  Our server was friendly but surprisingly unknowledgeable  about the menu.  At this price point, servers should have at least sampled the menu and be able to describe dishes and make recommendations.    Heist was packed on our Saturday night visit.  Hopefully the management will continue to work on execution because this place seems to have the potential to be really great or settling into mediocrity; bringing in hipsters who care more about the space and local than a higher echelon of crafted beer and quality food."}
{"text":"What can I say about Heist... The food is pretty good,  and if you can ever get seated you might even get to decide that for yourself. 2 out of the 3 times I've been here I've left with an empty stomach.  This place has a ton of potential however it's managed by a team of young hipsters that more than less likely are working to pay for their liberal arts degrees.   You would think that people destined to work at Starbucks would be able to manage people better.. Unfortunately that kind of greatness can't be expected overnight and apparently everyone here is still learning the in's and out 's of serving and restaurant management.  Dont worry young space cadets,  you'll get there.  Also,  good luck figuring out which door to enter.. I won't divulge those juicy details in this review... Some things are better experienced first hand.   On a side note,  the beer (the reason you come to a brewery)  is decent. The bloody mary's were crap (really... Who doesn't use Zing Zing?).    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Barmaid was rude, and seemed absolutely uninterested in serving us. We will never go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Big fan... especially since none of the other local breweries really cater towards the dinning in experience quite like Heist does.  I know the focus should be beer, but why not have an awesome, cozy tasting room/dining room to go along with your delicious tasting beer?  Don't let the outside of the building fool you... it is very unassuming and blends in with the other NoDa buildings in the area, once you step inside, you feel like you are in a ski lodge with lots of natural woods and stones.  The beer makers are front and center behind glass and there is a bar with lots of tables around....  looks like there is a 2nd story for over flow seating (or private parties?).  Just an overall comfortable setting.  I had dinner there with a fellow yelp friend.  No expectations since I heard the opening was somewhat disorganized (might have been just too crowded).  Our server was pretty awesome she gave us solid recommendations and had tried everything on the menu save a couple items and had a distinct opinion about all of them!  I always think it's great when the employees are passionate about what they are talking about and providing.  We built our own flights and had flat breads and burgers... and were stuffed to delight.  Definitely need to come back and try more menu items!  of course the BEER too....  a lot of the normal brews were out, but they only serve fresh/seasonal beers so it makes sense that the menus were had to be clarified by the server - good thing we had a good one to give us the 411."}
{"text":"Dear Heist,  We've had our ups and downs since you first opened. But we've worked through the problems. Your beer has become amazing and your food is still consistently amazing. Your staff, especially Kelly and Andrew are top notch! And I've become a big fan again!  The highlights are your beer are the juicy IPAs and the Cataclysm series. The food options including the chorizo sliders, pork belly tacos and and brunch bowl with chorizo are all amazing.   It's nice to see a brewery listen to feedback from the community. I've taking crowlers of your beer elsewhere and you now have fans from all over.  My only complaint is the limited batches of your beer but I know you are working on that and opening a production facility soon.  Still, you've made it in my top 2 of Charlotte breweries. We've come a long way.   Thanks, Heist!"}
{"text":"Came for the Sunday Brunch and holy cow, it was amazing. I really don't understand how I haven't been here yet. It was a person who eats a ton dream. We got there right before 11:30am, which seemed to be the perfect time to get there.....got there right before the crowds starting getting there. We had a party of 5 and we were seated immediately. Our waitress Sarah, was awesome....loved her. I was amazed by the amount of food options available at the buffet. They also had an omelette and waffle station (boy, was those waffles to die for). They are definitely about presentation when it comes to their food. They did an amazing job with that. The brunch is $15 and definitely a good bang for your buck. They also had $3 Bloody Mary's that were also phenomenal. Read reviews about how poor their beer selection is.....I didn't have beer during my visit, so I can't speak on that portion of it. I'm loving this place and I will for sure be back soon. Keep doing what you do.........."}
{"text":"This place's brunch is amazing.  We went for brunch on Sunday and had a phenomenal time. First off, the value of their brunch is incredible. For $19 you order an entree (I had fried chicken with tempura fried egg over mac and cheese - yum; my friend had steak and eggs hash) and it comes with the brunch buffet which includes made-to-order waffles with a cinnamon apple compote, made-to-order flatbreads, hand carved local meats, chicken sausage, bacon, grits, potatoes, a fruit and veggie sampling and even more. Our server was the best. She was attentive and very welcoming. The ambiance is great - a bit packed for brunch but nothing I wouldn't expect for a place like this. I highly recommend! Also they allow pets on their quite large patio."}
{"text":"I recently visited Heist with a few colleagues for a Sunday Brunch celebration! We had worked a 300 person wedding the night before and thought we earned a hearty meal and a few drinks. I'm going to rate the value/food a 5, and the service/experience a 3, so rounding out to a 4.   The seating/reservation process was slightly confusing and ultimately it took us about 20 minutes to be seated (even though there were 6-8 tables in server's sections that weren't being used). This was after I spent 20 minutes literally stalking every person who left the building to try to grab their parking spot. Parking at this place is horrendous when it's busy.   Once we were seated, things went slightly more smoothly. I think that the waiter was overwhelmed and had too many tables, because it took quite a long time to get our drinks and subsequent refills. Often times we had to flag him down as he was running back and forth. However, since it was a buffet, we never had to wait for food so that was nice.   The value of the experience was definitely worth the price point of the buffet. I liked that you got to choose an a la carte option from the menu in addition to the buffet. I also liked the waffles (you have to request them from your server, but they were a hit).   Overall, once you can find parking and get a seat, things are good. I had a great peach bellini with my meal and my colleagues shared a mimosa pitcher. The pitcher itself was an odd shape and it kept spilling when they poured, but that could have also been the tipsiness.. : )"}
{"text":"This is on the list of places that I really, really, really want to like. Something is just missing. I come back every few months hoping to like it. I am usually disappointed.  It is really beautiful inside. They have done a great job with fixing up the place. Sometimes it feels like they spent too much money on the décor and not enough on the beer and food (this is a typical Charlotte problem that I have noticed)  Some of the food feels gimmicky- like the shrimp with cotton candy wrapped around it. The flatbread is meh. The most painful thing is the beer though. It just isn't good. I love a brewpub. Charlotte NEEDS a good brewpub. I don't think this is it. I know I sound like a harsh beer snob, but I really expected better beer.   The brunch- it is a buffet brunch. I'm just going to say it- I'm not sure if Charlotte needs another buffet brunch. It was pricey. It really wasn't that good (buffets aren't really my thing though)  POSITIVE- I did go here for a holiday dinner once. The food was not on the menu. They have stuffed chicken that was INCREDIBLE. The service was really good. This is actually a great space for a business luncheon or a holiday party."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Got a flight of beer and loved all of the choices. Their all American burger was awesome as well. Everyone at our table loved what they ordered."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in their gluten free menu. The shrimp dish came out fried and turns out it was fried with other gluten containing items- the manager did come out to talk to us but the conversation turned into an argument over what qualifies as gluten free. He also kept claiming to understand restrictive diets and kept talking about his personal dairy issues and not listening to the fact that we would have ended up extremely sick because of mislabeling on the menu.  I'm giving them 2 stars for offering options other than beer on the drink menu and for the fact that the waitress was nice and did a good job considering the situation."}
{"text":"I had heard from friends that a new-ish brewery in NoDa--Heist--had an amazing brunch deal for $15 brunch buffet and $10 bottomless mimosas. That's right. Unlimited champagne and orange juice heaven.  I knew there would be a wait so we decided to show up early to try to get space. I told everyone else to meet up at 12:00PM because in North Carolina you CAN'T SERVE ALCOHOL until noon on Sundays.   Before noon is God's time, and then it can be booze time the rest of the day.  It turns out for a table of 20 people, you're going to have to wait over 2 hours. I noticed for others coming in with 2-6 people, it was taking anywhere between 30 minutes-1 hour so that's not too bad.  But the wait was so worth it.  Our waiter had a mustache--typical NoDa.  The food--oh my gosh--the food. The whole back bar area is food buffets that include breakfast foods like eggs, sausage, and bacon, but also rum-soaked pineapple, flatbread breakfast pizza and more. The lunch stations had BBQ chicken legs, amazing mashed potatoes, & steak & veggie kebobs. Let's not forget the oyster bar [which I heard was good but I couldn't bring myself to try] and a waffle bar which was heaven on a plate.  And yes, they kept those mimosas flowing for us the whole time. Six mimosas later, I definitely felt like I got way more than my $10 worth. Adrienne got the bloody mary, and ay caramba, my taste of it was delicious. I didn't even know I liked bloody marys until I tried this one.  As a side note--I've also been here for late night drinks. Their beer cocktails are phenomenal [beer with liquor, liquer, or other mix-ins], and I've heard their late night small plates are even better, although we didn't try them.  To round it out: I love the building, I love this brewery, and I love this brunch."}
{"text":"We hit Heist around 3pm on a Tuesday and had the place pretty much had the place to ourselves.  We had beer flights which allowed us to sample several brews.  We enjoy Belgian style beers and these hit the spot.  We had a flat bread, pretzels with beer cheese and asian wings and they were all good.  Really wanted the pork belly corn dog, but learned that is only a dinner item."}
{"text":"This place was huge. Now I will say, for a brewery this size they had the smallest selection of on tap beer than any of the other breweries visited. The food was pretty good - did the special 4 course meal. The asparagus was too salty, the fish was good, the dessert was good but tasted too much like the gas torch that melted the marshmallows. Service was good, it got kinda dark though when they turned some of the lights off in the brewery part that was right next to where I was sitting. Lots of TVs, bathrooms were well kept."}
{"text":"Great set up.   Lots of space. Open floor plan.  Clean and packed.   This is a brewpub for sure.  I tried the heart if tartness. Papter tots.    Tryions table.  And   penny porter.   They were all solid beers but nothing really grabbed me.   Super nice bartenders.   Only tried the banana egg rolls but they were great."}
{"text":"I had such a bad experience there. Hostess staff didn't acknowledge us upon entering. I had to ask \"can someone help us?!\" It was like four of them standing there. They sat us at a table and it took the server a good 15 minutes to greet us (you are probably thinking why didn't we leave. Beautiful day for patio weather and drinks, plus we were in from out of town and on foot). It took him another 15 minutes to bring out our drinks. We were told that if we wanted food we could only get flatbreads. So we ordered the quesadilla, because that was considered a flatbread. Once it arrived, we had to send it back because there was hair on it. Took the server a long time to bring out the check.  TLDR: horrible service, hair in food, wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Yummy stouts  atmosphere was perfect    Thanks Natalie!  Service was excellent"}
{"text":"What I would order again -  Fry Basket Crab Dip Beer Cheese Pork Belly Tacos Flight of beers for a person who hates IPA's.  What I wouldn't order again -  Chicken and Waffles - waffles are too dry Carne Asada Flatbread - Not enough carne Sweet & Spicy Dumplings - Taste is confusing - unanimous vote of three people. Chuck Wagon Wheels - I don't like the breading all over the meat.  Country fried anything tastes like the fried breading only...takes over all the flavor."}
{"text":"It is unfathomable to me how a place full of dbag hipsters and the nouveau riche can manage to be so sh*tty and pretentious serving mediocre food and awful beer. Customer service is nonexistent here and the place routinely smells like vomit. Seriously, what is that smell??? Much be the stink of the attitudes. Have been here with friends twice for celebrations. Would never voluntarily return with SO many better options in the neighborhood. Ugh. Hope this deliberately trendy place crashes and burns and makes space for a real, quality brewery and not something thrown up with a ton of money to attract past-their-prime frat boys trying to act like they can stomach something other than Bud."}
{"text":"I've been to Heist twice. The first time with a large group of friends and found their food excellent. Their beer, however was very watered down. As a beer lover, I found this very disappointing especially a from a brewery.   The second time I attended their brunch in a small group. As expected it was very busy, and it took about 10 minutes before our server came to take our initial drink orders. While it may not have been his fault, the management could have planned a little better by distributing their staff evenly to ensure better and more timely service. While their brunch looked appealing, the food was both cold and unimpressive. I had high expectations given their dinner menu but was disappointed when I ate cold mussels, eggs, hardened grits, and bacon. Fortunately, we also ordered from the a la carte menu and the omelette was more enjoyable than their brunch buffet.  In all, I may return for their dinner menu in hopes the they decide to stop watering down their beers. I will, however, never come back for brunch."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Very fun and amazing food.  Four of us went and we shared the caesar egg rolls, cheeseburger flatbread, chicken and waffles (my favorite), beer cheese, and lobster pasta.  Every item was great and unique. Drinks were all good too.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for an interview and after spending my morning getting interrogated with tough technical questions, I needed an afternoon drink (or 3) to get my good mood back. I'd bookmarked a handful of breweries but was bummed to find that none of them were open as early as I was ready to go tasting, so when I saw that Heist was open early AND had food, I headed straight over and found myself a seat at the bar.  I didn't know much about their beer before arriving, but was delighted to discover that they do a great balanced Belgian. Louisa, my awesome bartender was happy to let me try a few things, recommend new options based on my preferences and even told me I made the perfect choice for lunch in going with the mac and cheese flatbread (carbs on carbs, you guys!). I tried most of what they had on tap and selected three different pints, my fave being the Out to Pasture. Nothing was two sweet and they did have an american style IPA on tap for those of you that prefer a hoppier beer.   It was busier than I would have thought for Friday lunchtime, so good for them for being busy. If I ever find myself back in Charlotte I'll totally be back for more yummy beer, pretty good food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Ordered the seasonal pumpkin beer they had known as Saison De Pon Pon and it tastes more like a wheat ale with a hint of cinnamon.  I was hoping for something more 'Pumpkiny' but this wasn't it.. The pumpkin beer they provided said it was brewed with 200 lbs of pumpkin hence why I expected the 'Pumpkiny' taste...  I don't mind the beer though because wheat ale is definitely my go to when it isn't pumpkin season.  Ordered the BBQ burger which had a burger patty with caramelized onions, artisan lettuce, and pulled pork on top! Everything was very consistent with each bite! There was jalapeños and pepper jack cheese which tied everything together and you couldn't really taste the jalapeños because the BBQ pulled pork flavor was a bit overpowering.  Oh boy and let me tell you about their side of tator tots!!!! Its like little hash browns with a hint of ginger and cheese.  I couldn't quite figure out how they made it but it definitely is not the average tator tots you could buy at the store.  It was crunchy on the outside and cheesey and chewy on the inside.  I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone in the mood for a juicy BBQ type of burger.  And their booze to wash it down is definitely a plus! For people who appreciate good beer.. this is the place to be!  Hope this was helpful! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time on their outdoor patio. The menu is so innovative: from limoncello wings to fig infused balsalmic oil, you can do no wrong here.  I'd definitely recommend the newest dark beer with pumpkin and chocolate notes."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people rave about the duck flatbread. It is roasted which is not a forgiving way to prepare duck and they need to shred it into very thin pieces because when you get a large chunk of duck in your mouth it's extremely gamey and I had to spit it out a few times.  yuck!"}
{"text":"Oh Heist how you've disappointed me. I live around the corner and have gone to Heist a couple times to get dinner and cocktails and enjoyed it. This last visit was for brunch and oh man was it bad. The buffet was okay, although some hot items were cold and rubbery. Bacon was great! The worst part of our meal however were the \"included\" items on the menu that we each got one of. I got the steak and eggs. It had 3 tiny over cooked cold pieces of steak, a hard fried egg (I asked for over easy), cold potatoes, and a \"steak sauce\" that tasted like a rotten ketchup. We also ordered the breakfast burrito, which was essentially a taquito with cold black beans inside. I can't say I'll ever come back for brunch."}
{"text":"This is solely based on the food experience. I would say that overall the food quality was subpar and did not meet the pricing. If you were you order something i would recommend the duck flatbread."}
{"text":"We paid this place a visit for the first time this weekend.  It is large and the service great.  I had a cocktail that I thought was quite delicious...which was surprising for a brewery (my husband is the beer drinker and I am not).  And while the food was maybe a solid 3.5 stars, I really appreciated having some vegetarian options!  I really liked the mediterranean salad flatbread, but thought the pretzel appetizer could use some tweaking.  Overall, I would go back if someone wanted to go there, but probably wouldn't go back on my own."}
{"text":"Went back a couple more times since my first try and I can elaborate more on the food. We tried a flatbread that was pretty standard the first time and then went back for their $15 Sunday brunch (which goes till 3pm).   While everyone was extraordinarily friendly, I would go early as we went at 2:30 and everything tasted a little old & cold. I will say however that despite not tasting the best you could tell at one time it would have been delicious. My favorites of the day were the grits (some of the best I've had), the Belgian waffles ...awesome and made Fresh for you- huge plus in my case, and rum soaked pineapple with mascarpone. For those who like mimosa's they run an unlimited deal for only $10-not too shabby at all.    Suggestions - Better Quality OJ, and some fresher-lighter fare options. Everything was very heavy. Even the oysters had a decadent cream sauce. I would have loved just some simply dressed fresh veggies or even a light summer salad to break it up a little.    The buffet only gets a 2.5/5 but I think that really is because we came too late in the game. I wish they had kept rotating a bit more frequently, but I get that logistics hampers things a bit. I would give it another chance."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for the weekend and a friend invited me here for Sunday brunch. I give 5 stars for the young lady that served us that afternoon, she was a gem!  As for the ambiance, it's a brewery so not much to expect there. I was not a fan of the buffet style brunch and then having people getting the fruit from plastic bins and pouring it out instead of taking it to the kitchen. It's all in the details.   They are definitely not vegetarian friendly unless you just want to scarf down all the sweets and carbs on the table. For sure, a meat lovers dream! The potatoes and few items that I did try, I wasn't impressed at all. The fruit was warm and they had a pineapple glazed in rum that was not pleasing at all. I've tried much better version of that back home in Miami.   Great outdoor seating, TERRIBLE PARKING, and great service. You want a good time and don't really care about the food? This is definitely your place!"}
{"text":"Unlike most breweries around Charlotte, they have an in-house kitchen. It's nice if you're not in the mood for a food truck. This place is great for sharing a bunch of food with a group and it has lots of options for vegetarians.  For a group of 3, we got the following food and it was plenty:  - Crispy Brussel Sprouts: crisped to perfection - Buffalo Cauliflower: fried but not greasy - Sweet and Spicy Pork Flatbread: delicious if you want to try something other than traditional flatbreads. Don't let the peaches freak you out! - Beer cheese and pretzels: I would give the beer cheese and 5 rating and the pretzels a 3."}
{"text":"Heist Brewery has come a looong way from what I remember a few years back. Not sure if many of you folks recollect but the beers here used to be \"flat\". Like, that was the intention - their claim to fame - was flat beers. Little to no carbonation. It was a hard start and people really talked a lot about it. Maybe it was intentional to get people in the door? I donno! But they did a big upset and flipped it all up one day.  They apparently hired a new brewmaster. The beers became stellar! Now you can find all manner of seasonal and small batch brews alongside their regular line up with lots of reliable flavors spanning the whole list of beer types. None of them flat! The bar staff is extremely helpful even at popular times - and they get a LOT of attention these days. So much so that the parking lot can be quite a bit of a pain. But as the weather warms up, a leisurely stroll to Heist from NoDa proper could be well rewarded with a cold one.  Oh and did I mention the finger foods? I've been in here on special events a time or two which were well catered, although I should probably refrain from reviewing since I haven't tried their full menu. Let's face it though, who cares about any of that stuff when you've got the good 'ol Heist BEER CHEESE and pretzel breadsticks. Amazing stuff! I can't speak much beyond that but when you're in here drinking and enjoying the amazing ambiance (love the window view into the brew room and all of the random wood detail on the walls) just leave the tab open and keep the beer cheese and Pater Tots pints coming."}
{"text":"While I can appreciate the goal here, I fear it falls short.    We arrived on a Sunday morning around 11 to make sure we had a good seat for the 1p football game.  The brunch was the only available menu so we did have it, however it seemed as though it had been our for hours.  The eggs tasted like an egg substitute, the bacon was flimsy fatty, and the biscuits were rock solid.  The waffles, on the other hand, were excellent.    We had friends arrive at 1:15 and all were disappointed that the only food available during gametime was breakfast.  For a brewery not to have bar food during football was just awkward.    We will definitely be back for other food at other times and will update accordingly.  It's a great neighborhood so hopefully it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times so far and have loved it every time.  The restaurant itself is huge, trendy, and inviting.  Very comfortable.  There's also a glass wall where you can see the brewery in action while you eat and drink.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  Let's talk about the beer.  I have had quite a few of their beers and have loved them all.  The most memorable for me were Dzl (IPA) and Cross Pollen Nation (stout).  The Duke of Ted (ESB) is also worth mentioning.  The food has always been pretty awesome here, too.  They have a \"Farm to Fork\" menu which showcases local meats and produce including grass-fed beef that is also partially fed with Heist's spent grains.  The only downside, we ordered from the tapas-style menu the last time we were there and the portions were smaller than explained by the waiter.  It is quite understandable as it was tapas, but next time we will order more options to share.  Come try a flight and some appetizers.  You'll love this place."}
{"text":"I will say, I really like the set up, they have outdoor seating, which is perfect for this time of year, and a great indoor set up. Only downside I had while here, I brought my computer to get work done, and when I tell you I had to wait about 30 mins, if not longer, for her to come check on me, after she had dropped my 2nd beer off, so I could finally order food. That annoyed me. On top of that, there were fruit flys all around me, & I wasn't even anywhere near the bar. The buffalo cauliflower was great though, I've been wanting to try something like that, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Extremely spaced out and unprofessional hostess. Almost 8 months pregnant and we are lead all the way in the back of a practically empty dining room and seated at a stool hightop. Thankfully, my fiancé asked if we could trade for seats with backs and luckily, it wasn't an issue.  $19 for a cold brunch buffet and extremely flavorless \"a la cartes\". Sad to say, the fruit was the only items worth anything.. our server's response to our first time experience \"oh, the food was cold? Well, we've always had a flat fee of $19 for the buffet.\" Super bummed for a place that has such a awesome appearance.."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food. We had the American cheese burger, bruchetta flatbread, & the Cuban. Also, the beer cheese dip was great too!"}
{"text":"I came here for sunday brunch with my husband and another couple. It was all our first time here for the brunch. They were busy and we were lucky enough to find a good parking space.   Their hostess stand is outside. There were 3 girls there total all talking and scrambling and on an ipad. There weren't any other customers waiting in that area. No one greeted me and I was ignored for several minutes. They kept discussing trying to find people for their table. Still waiting....We finally get greeted and no hello or nothing. We just get asked how many people. I told her. She asked us for our preference for inside or outside and I said inside. Then she said ok, 2 people for inside. I had to correct her it was for 4 people. She was so distracted on that ipad and talking with the other girl she wasn't even paying attention. It was a hassle.   We got sat and the server was great. He was super friendly and attentive. He explained everything. They have juice at the buffet. It was room temperature so I asked the server if I an get a glass of ice. He came back with my glass of ice and when I received it there was a HUGE clump of dark brown hair all in and around the ice with huge black specks. I called him over and showed him and he said he was going to get me another glass of ice. I saw him go behind the bar, get a new glass and some ice and starts walking towards me with the new glass of ice. He put the glass to his face and turned it all around and he saw something and went back to get me a 3rd glass of ice. I was so turned off by it. I can understand maybe one hair because it happens but a huge clump was just gross."}
{"text":"What a great brunch!! Came down before the Panthers game to eat. Not only is it an entire buffet, fresh juices and flatbreads- you also get a menu item! You will leave stuffed and happy!"}
{"text":"Came here for the infamous Sunday brunch. Well I will say you definitely get your money's worth. You get the whole buffet as well as a side dish to order and juice. There were some awesome drunken mussels and I loved the flatbread. The fruit wasn't super fresh but the donuts were! The food gets 2 1/2 stars from me but the mimosas get 5! They were so addicting. Think great champagne and delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. A carafe is $12 and it's a huge carafe! Tip: if you are going to make reservations make sure to do so in advance. Hey do not take them the day if."}
{"text":"I finally got to try the brunch buffet here on a Sunday as I've heard a lot about it. It's definitely not your typical brunch because it's a crowded brewery and they have a varied assortment of flavorful flatbread with breakfast toppings and brie!   They also have the main staples for brunch which I actually skipped most of because it didn't look as appetizing. The biscuits were just meh as well.  Also, I skipped the beer here as the previous times I've been, they tasted water down. You know something is up when a review for a brewery starts with their more well-known brunch. I've seen a Heist rep responding to people's comments on how they've changed their beer recipes, so I guess I should try it out before passing judgement on the current beer."}
{"text":"Brunch and Bloody Mary's.   Good stuff.  Had a decent selection for bunch, a more conveyer belt style than I would have liked...grilled pineapples  were a nice touch - and who doesn't love a pan of bacon??"}
{"text":"We tried out Heist Brewery this past Friday night. We parked at the YMCA and walked... We weren't exactly sure if we were going the right way until we saw the arrows pointing us toward Heist on the sidewalk.  Once we got there we immediately loved the ambiance and decor! There was about a 20 minute wait so we headed to the bar to get one of their craft made beers (they only serve their creations by the way). I have to say... We were not impressed with the beer. I had the red #7, my husband the IPA and out friend the wheat. They offer one of their version of each major type of beer (wheat, pale ale, IPA, etc) and each one we tried was just a bare bone version and lacked complexity. I give them point for their menu though...they do have some interesting selections. They also have small plate section (like the trend in most major cities) to facilitate sharing and trying different items. I loved the way the presentation of the food and trediness of the restaurant. We had pretty good service and loved the feel of the place. Overall good experience, the food was pretty decent. I give them four stars for trying! We'll be back....not for the beers though!"}
{"text":"Gone here a few times to chill in the patio and listen to live music on the weekends.   Haven't tried the food but have ordered flights of beer and whiskey. Last time I was there the flight of beers were warm when we got it and they weren't generous at all with the amount of whiskey. I get it's a flight, but there was barely enough to really taste and enjoy the whiskey!   Nonetheless, really great vibes, chill atmosphere and perfect outdoor seating and live music is always a plus!"}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch is the best brunch in town. I also recommend the San Fran Disco pale ale. On 5-16-15 Heist Brewery will pouring at the South End Hops Festival...cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!   Good, casual, good-for-groups atmosphere. Come here with your friends if you want to shout the whole time at them. Do not come here for a date or any occasion where you want to have a conversation. The plus side is that because the place is so loud all around, no one else can hear your conversation either. It's got a high-end sports bar atmosphere, which I love, but it just might need a few more screens.   The beers are pretty darn tasty. We got some fancy wings, fries, and a flatbread to share. Everything was really good. I only wish we'd brought more people and money so that we could have tried more on the menu. I can't tell you how many times we eyed the dishes that were being served to our neighbors.   It's a bit on the pricey side considering it's still got that sports bar vibe, but if you are any sort of foodie, you'll like it.  Note: The bartender doesn't seem to know how to make a Moscow Mule or any variation of. I got something with really flat too-sweet ginger beer, and not enough lime. Sad face. So, protip: stick to beer."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio that was very dog friendly. Nice beer selection & food was outstanding! Live music on Saturday afternoons. Cool place to hang"}
{"text":"Having had lived in Portland, OR for most of my adult life, I have to say, this is some of the most adventurous AND tasty brewing I've come across. NW IPA's are my all-time favorite beers, and their DZL was hoppy, balanced, and delicious. Their Pistolo, an amber ale brewed with habanero, was neither too spicy nor too cloying, like some infused beers can be. It was balanced and delicious. SO delicious. And now let me start on the food. We had the shrimp and bleu cheese grits, freaking fabulous and balanced,  the brussel sprouts in the bubble (I don't remember the exact name) was BEYOND amazing, and the faux-b-q eggplant tacos were super yummy. After the fabulous drink and food, you add in the service and this place is a must stop for anybody living in, visiting, or within driving distance. Nick Walker, the bartender, and Curt (Kurt?), the owner actually engaged in great conversation with us and others there. We will be back. Tomorrow, actually. And if I ever visit here again, you can bet your ass I'll be in one of there seats. I think you should be, too. If you like craft beer and twisted eats, that is."}
{"text":"6:30 arrival on a Friday after work before a concert at the Neighborhood Theatre we beat the rush a little bit which is what I recommend. We had a group of six sitting in the bar section which worked for us. We ordered 6 plates and then also got a 7th, the chicken and waffle tacos which was a perfect amount of food for 6 hungry people.  The burger burger burger sliders were good though not my favorite. I loved the chicken and waffle tacos and the Mongolian beef. Also really liked the buffalo cauliflower. Again everything was really good. Several good Heist beers on tap which were perfect for a summer evening. The bruschetta flatbread was also good."}
{"text":"Beautiful building, ridiculous food and houses one of Charlotte's best bartenders.   Killer trio right there.   You know you're doing something right when you talk to people about this place and each one of them has a different must-try fav on the menu.  I've never had a meal that I didn't like. My top three favorites: the Duck Flatbread (root beer bbq should be illegal it's so darn good), Chicken & Waffle Sushi, and the Brew Master BBQ Burger. I'm not one who goes to a restuarant and orders a burger... but when I do it's that one.  On top of the wide selection of handcrafted beers and craft cocktails, Heist also makes homemade sodas and floats.   Heist also offers a fantastic brunch buffet on Sundays. The spread is insane. There is a different featured protein each week. This can range anywhere from fried catfish to bacon wrapped meatloaf. They also have a waffle station, oyster bar, flat breads, fruit, frittatas... the list goes on and on. Stefan Huebner makes a killer homemade bloody mary mix, but I'm a slave to the $10 bottomless mimosas.  If you want to hit up brunch: go EARLY. Heist fills up quickly. If there's a wait, go ahead and grab a drink at the bar. The wait is well worth it.  Cheers to a a great first year Heist. I'll see you at the anniversary party on the 24th."}
{"text":"Came up from Charleston to see the Darius Rucker show and followed the recommendation of a friend to come here. 1717 hot wings were great and the Beer Cheese Burger on a pork belly brioche bun was amazing!!! (As were the beers-San Fran Disco 5.4% American pale ale my favorite) the best aspect was the bartender-Kelly. Cheers to great food, great beer and the kindest and most attentive service! Can't say enough about the service-knowledgeable, suggestive and just so inviting. Go to Heist and find Kelly. You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Really great place.  The craft beer is moderately priced and high quality.   The beer cheese is a must have.  Great staff!"}
{"text":"First time I've been to Heist brunch, they apparently just reworked the menu.  The brunch buffet is a colossal amount of food and in a thinly veiled attempt to kill their patrons you're offered an à la carte item as well.    So in addition to buffet items like the waffle, grits, biscuits, roast, flatbread pizza, potatoes (all excellent) and eggs, sausages, bacon (all pretty meh) we ordered the leaf eater omelet and the hash brown.    I make omelets everyday like a machine that runs on eggs and butter and usually restaurant omelets are a watery, over cooked mess.  This omelet was on point with tomatoes that actually tasted like tomatoes (unfortunately seems to be more and more rare).  The hash browns  were also good.  So even though some of the buffet proteins were kinda gross (and really I don't think I've had buffet bacon or sausage that were good) I have to give props to Heist for their brunch.  A++++ would eat all my days calories in one sitting again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! They have awesome food and awesome drinks!!! This maybe my new NoDa hangout!!!  On my visit I had the chicken and waffles tacos (recommended by my server) and the whiskey ginger sour. The chicken and waffles were good. You get three waffles stuffed with chicken pieces. I was expecting them to be hotter than they were but I truly enjoyed them. The chicken was spicy and the waffles were very sturdy and by that I meant they kept their shape and held the chicken well. The syrup was sweet but not too sweet. I asked for more of the hot sauce butter to add a little extra spice.   Now they whiskey ginger sour Hot the spot. I could have sucked that down it was made so well. I don't taste much ginger but the flavor was good.   I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Heist Brewery. They have tables and bar seats, live music, quieter areas and really cool artwork.    I definitely have to come back and try more of their food and drinks.    Heist Brewery  2909 N Davidson St, Ste 200, Charlotte, NC 28205 Friday March 2, 2018 10:15pm"}
{"text":"I have to echo several other recent comments - Heist's beer selection is on POINT! I tried the cafe de saison (coffee and saison? what? so good) and also enjoyed both IPAs on tap. It's hard to stand out in a world full of IPAs, but their Thirst is worth trying and then going back for again.  Having only been here for brunch before, I was excited to try Heist's acclaimed small plates menu. The lobster mac and cheese was REALLY good. It had true, thick, tender, lightly fried lobster pieces atop a bowl of cheesy goodness. Also, my hard-to-please dad couldn't stop raving over his pork belly tacos.  Overall, I like the space and vibe of Heist. It's nice and open, but the food prices are a little too high to make this a go-to spot. Keep up the good work on the taps!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place - it has become my new go-to place in NODA. The beer is great and the food is FUN. I haven't made my way through the whole menu yet but I am working my way through it. Some of my faves are the pork belly corn dogs, flatbreads and their homemade focaccia bread is great. My only complaint is that I can't rate it any higher!"}
{"text":"I visited this bar for a networking event. It's clean and spacious.Parking is limited so be prepared to walk.   The bartender was nice and recommended The High Five. It was surprisingly delicious since I only usually drink hard ciders. I will definitely be back for another high five and try some food."}
{"text":"They are finishing up on their renovation and it looks fabulous. The beers were out of this world. Very original tastes. We got two flights of beer and could not have been more pleased. Flatbreads were great as well. Would absolutely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Heist is a modern/rustic clean and open loft style space. It is most definitely a hipster location. And perhaps a little snooty even. (It was the only place in the Carolinas I went and my smile wasn't returned. Just like being back home in Los Angeles lol! ) Half of the main room downstairs holds their many steel brew canisters or whatever they're called. It's neat to see those while hanging out in the bar/dining area. There was a DJ company providing entertainment that night and MCing trivia games that lasted longer than we were prepared to stay, but was a lot of fun.   The beer is a big draw, but not for me. I was interested in the tapas. We were a party of four and we tried a lot of things. All were a either a hit or a miss.  Hit: Beer cheese! Really creamy and nice bite to it. It is served with crusty breadsticks for dipping. It was so good we finished it with our fingers like animals. (It was the first thing out and we were all really hungry ;) We all noticed the table next to us hadn't finished theirs and just left it behind. We all sort of smiled at the thought of s l o w l y reaching over and gobbling up theirs too. Of course we didn't! We had some decency. What do you think we are, animals? wait...   Miss: the salmon tacos. Sigh. The salmon was sashimi style, tossed in a light dressing with delicate sprouts and scallions, really tasty. But, it was totally overwhelmed by the tough, thick and completely bland shell it comes in :( It didn't pair well, at all. It needed something crispy and crunchy to hold it. I scooped out the others and left the pasty white, bready tortilla thingies behind. That ended up being about a tablespoon or two of deliciousness though.   Another miss: lobster Mac n cheese. All of us were underwhelmed by the lobster macaroni and cheese. Sounds amazing right? It even had leeks in it if I remember correctly. How bad could it be?  So boring though, really. Wah wah. Bland. We didn't even bother finishing it.   Not a scallops fan, but they were Amazing.... Really great, seared. I want to say maybe bacon was involved but again, unsure. They came in shot glasses. I have to say, the presentation for everything is really creative and interesting.   I don't eat lamb, but the others loved it. It was served in a red wine sauce with porcini mushrooms. It was really rich and served a mini skillet with lots of sauce for dipping bread into; although, it doesn't come with bread.   Heist seems determined to incorporate their beer into many things including the mixed drinks. I ordered two of them that mixed beer with spirits and I found them undrinkable. The drinks I ordered had ginger and/or peach and a limeade deal, iwith mint or cilantro it was all just trying to do waaaay too much. Next time I will stick to beer with it being a brewery and all.  And I will definitely go back for the beer cheese. Overall, we had a jolly good time.   Note to owner/management: the website looks great but not very user friendly. People on iPads and especially phones don't want to download a menu. Fact: 50% of all traffic to restaurants is coming from mobile devices. How about a menu? In fact, who wants to download a menu onto their home computer either? Hmmm. Strange."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday and omg it was amazing! It's buffet style and you choose a main entree from a menu as well. The food was soo good and so many different options. Also, try a bloody mary! They make their own mix and it was perfect and spicy! Gotta get there early, there's usually a but of a wait."}
{"text":"Great place for a date night. The food as well as the beer is so good. We've been here a few times now and have not been disappointed. Service is top notch as well."}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time. Now before I start, I have been to all of the breweries in the local area (NoDa,Birdsong,OMB,etc) and usually I am fairly pleased with what they have to offer. Consequently, I had to give Heist a try. The first problem that I had right off the bat was the incredibly miniscule and poor selection of beer. First off, there are no medium % IPA's; which every brewery that I have ever been to has offered (they were all either too low, 3.9, or too high 7.8). Secondly the other beers were simply okay, but not anything special, they all were a little bit off. Lastly, the food was slightly overpriced compared to other local places."}
{"text":"We have been to Heist a few times and always had a great experience, which is why we decided to have our engagement party here and it turned out to be a great choice! Prior to our engagement party the event planner, Paula, was extremely helpful, offering us various pricing and location options to match exactly what we were looking for. Once we arrived the staff was very attentive, the atmosphere was welcoming and, as always, the food and beer were both enjoyable and delicious! We will definitely go back and I would recommend Heist to anyone who appreciates great food and craft beer!"}
{"text":"It took a while for anyone to acknowledge our presence at the hostess stand, even though it was not a busy night.  Once someone said hello, it only took a few minutes to get seated.  The food was good.  The best were the pork belly corn dogs, which were a delicious spin on the classic.  The meat was super tender and the surrounding batter was crispy.  The pimento flatbread pizza came in second.  It had a spicy kick!  We wanted to order the shrimp stix, but the cotton machine was broken.  We settled on the salmon, which was good, but nothing special.  It was also kind of messy to share.  The 3x sliders came in last because they were so charred to the point of burnt.  I couldn't finish my slider because most of it was too burnt to eat.  We finished the meal with the caramelized banana eggrolls.  They were pretty small and not very filling.  Service was good, but lacking because they ran out of clean plates and our food came out before our plates...so we were sitting trying to split the flatbread pizza between 3 people without any plates.  We also had to flag our server down to get drink refills.  Luckily the drinks kept our spirits bright!  The Tito's Mule was definitely refreshing, especially when it was unseasonably warm for December in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now and have to rave abt how awesome it is!!  I have 3 fave things: cheeseburger flatbread, chicken and waffles, and the diablos. I've tried several things on the menu and have yet to come across something I don't like. Only one complain: THOSE LITTLE ROUND STOOLS ARE NOT COMFY!  I always request a stool with a back on it, that helps."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this location is great, and we had a good time exploring the options on tap, but o would love to see more variety offered from the brewery and better service"}
{"text":"Heist is in a beautiful, beautiful building. That's, essentially, the only positive.   In a city like Charlotte that has a dozen or more breweries, you can easily find better beer literally down the road. Food is overpriced.   In a neighborhood like NoDa, known for its funky artists and bohemian qualities, I'm always so disappointed to learn that it's brunch buffet has essentially no vegan options. Additionally, there's no menu to order from if you choose to not get the buffet.  Go down the road a bit to Birdsong or any of the restaurants on North Davidson. You'll be happier."}
{"text":"WOW! First visit...definitely not our last. Great atmosphere!!! Creative menu and friendly service! We loved the pork belly corn dogs, the Maibock Brew and of course the banana eggrolls. Next time I probably wont repeat the Little People Tacos or the Steak Papaya Martini."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I have been here 4 times now. Great friend BBQ ribs, charcuterie board, and Mexican steak pizza. The beer is also great, but I would suggest asking how many oz. per glass since some can come in a snifter and still be expensive. Love the atmosphere and the food. Word to Heist: please, please keep at least 1 IPA on draft. I went there the other weekend and didn't have any options for myself since I'm an IPA snob :/"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and I've been here to chill out after work. Their sunday brunch as many have stated can't be beat. But this is also a really nice place to come to and unwind after work.  Good food good alcohol and you can always try something new each time. This is one of my favorite go to spots in Noda."}
{"text":"I like this place, I genuinely do. What bothers me though is that they close the kitchen early at night time which doesn't allow people to get a real meal late night if they wanted to. I feel like it would be more profitable for them to offer their full menu up until the kitchen closes.  Their beer is great, and you can tell it's fresh from the cloudiness that appears in the beer when it pours into a glass. All the beers are full of flavor. This past visit I was a little disappointed though, because I called before hand to see if they would have certain specialty beers available that were only set to be served that night, and when I went there, they were all out. I guess you can say I could of used my common sense to think that something that is in limited supply would run out pretty quick, but it would of been nice of the person I talked to on the phone to be courteous and remind me of such."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and beautiful building. We have been here twice for the beer and to hang out. Love the outdoor section where you can bring your pups! Inside is awesome and the people are so nice! We haven't much food here but what we had tasted during the NODA food tour, it was delicious. The head chef is awesome and know what he is doing here! Cannot wait to continue to come back with our out of town family and dog on a regular basis!  Ps- High Five beer is my fav! Def have to try!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food. ATROCIOUS service.  I've been to Heist a few times and keep coming back for the amazing dishes and fun atmosphere. A group and myself went last night for a friend's birthday and waited THREE hours total for our meal. Our waitress, while sweet, was overwhelmed and not present. We waiting 45 min for a water refill and one couple waited an extra 30 min for their dish while everyone else ate. I tend not to complain, simply because I am in the hospitality business and I know that much of it is out of the servers hands... However it got so bad that we decided to seek a manager. We waited another 20 for the manager to show up and were told, \"we are a tapas style restaurant so that's just how it is.\" We were also given gift cards... How much is our time worth you ask? It is apparently worth FIVE DOLLARS. What a joke. She couldn't have cared less and I am not sure I will go back even the food is fun and delicious!! Customer service and a simple apology would have gone a long way."}
{"text":"So I will admit up front I do not drink beer, but I like a good brewery atmosphere. One of the things I really like about Heist is that it has a great selection of other spirits for us non-beer drinkers (unlike some breweries). I've tasted about 4 of their specialty cocktails, and I've enjoyed all of them. The cocktail menu rotates which is cool, but also a bit of a bummer if you find a drink you really love. The food is also good. It's tapas style, with good portions for sharing. I've tried the pork belly tacos, sliders, duck flatbread, wings, and a few other items and I wasn't disappointed by any of them. When the weather is nice, the patio is a great place to hang out. It's not huge, but it's nice and the live music out there is great. When the weather isn't cooperating, the inside atmosphere is also very nice. This is probably the best brewery I've been to so far in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This was an adventure and a pretty good trek from my usual breakfast eateries.  This is a brewery in the Charlotte NoDa (North Davidson ) area. Parking can be a challenge and the wait can be considerable. Reservations recommended for parties of 4 or more. We were able to get seated quickly at BAR#3. (Yes they have 3 bars) You can get a full brunch at the bar just as you can at the tables. It's a  great atmosphere and it's a LARGE buffet with an A la carte breakfast entree included. The food is good but I was expecting slightly better flavor. I had the shrimp and grits entree and it  was....average. All together a good dining experience. I'd recommend this  for small groups or visitors to the city."}
{"text":"When Huxley recommended we go to Heist on Friday night, I was less than enthusiastic. We'd just finished watching the most recent episode of Girls, so Hux was really overwrought with placid angst and sexual energy. \"Oh, come on,\" she said. \"Don't be a downer. I wanna go out and make it a night.\" She said the word 'night' in that heavily inflected way of hers that lets me know with a drop of her eyes and the angle of her chin that this 'night' could involve anything.  I envisioned my girl all tweaked and wild and sweaty, possibly in some condition of undress, and most likely getting me at some point punched in the nose. \"Okay, I'm in.\" We sashayed into Heist like c-list movie stars. When Hux fires up, she really comes out: ankle-boot wedge heels, tight black leggings climbing shear up her fecund thighs, some oversized top strewn sloppily about her soft long torso, and all that hair there playin' round her shoulders like the gods in the box of the heathers in the vale.  Heist is a brew-hall, for sure. It's a brew-ha-ha. It's a gorgeous dungeon of a bar, replete with heavy wood that anchors all around you and seals you in, lavish lights and golden ornamentation, harsh acoustics lapping the same dull roar back and back on you like succeeding waves. In an instant, I sank into it. In an instant, I needed a beer. \"This is me,\" I said to Hux, eyes alight with glitter and glean. \"How did I not know?\" She rubbed one tiny hand into my shoulder and led me forward through the room.  We ended up spending most of the evening at the downstairs bar. We elbowed and angled our way up to the black marble, visions aglance to all the beautiful people wilting and undulating all about, forearms crossed, eyes squinting to note the options on the little white drink placard before us. There were no clever names or silly mix-breeds here. This was beer, labeled as it is, stripped down, honest, and pure. \"I'll have the IPA,\" I heard myself say seven or eight times in a row.  Some blond bird, a real horrorshow display of pixie sexiness at its most unbreakable, was shoving her face full of chicken wings at the opposite corner of the bar. As I watched her unabashedly suckle honey glaze from each twiggy fingertip, a comely waitress sauntered by, wooden slats of flatbread pizzas in each hand, and the aroma drifted hot behind her in a trail like savory smoke. I slung back my first drink fast and deep, then gestured in the blond pixie's direction with my chin. Hux glanced her way, narrowed her eyes, processed, and then her face softened into a lurid glare. \"God, I love this place,\" I said to her. \"Get me drunk,\" she replied.  Our man, our bartender man, was a handsome grizzly of a bloke, bald head, exquisitely manicured beard, dark and throaty, barrel-chested like a viking king. Women approached him like giddy schoolgirls. He had this way of shaking their hands, where he'd clasp each of theirs in one of his and bow and shiver in a little curtsy, and dear god those girls just ate it all up. Hell, so did I.  This ravishing songstress scampered by, raven-haired and goddess tall and all lean up and down and beneath and below the shimmering strands of her flapper gown. She met another girl, almost equal in design, and they alit in a white-hot embrace. They turned to me. \"Can you take our picture?\" they asked.  \"I'll take all your pictures.\"  They kissed cheeks and kicked knees high and tilted their heads and flung their curls and I captured it all, each gesture, each wildly waving hand, down forever in a digital frame. \"Are you lovers?\" I asked.  \"No, we just met.\" I felt Hux grab my cheeks, hard and tight, her thumb and forefinger crushing my mouth in against my lower teeth. She twisted my face to meet her own. \"What are you doing?\" she said.  \"Making new friends.\"  The two girls laughed and flashed out their neon bomb smiles and they grabbed Hux and hugged her and complimented her hair. \"What are you drinking?\" she asked them. \"Anything,\" they replied. Hux turned to me, lips apout, cheeks high and fiery. \"Buy them drinks,\" she commanded.  After a few Oatmeal Stouts and Red Ales and way too many perfectly-formed novelty martinis, we and our two new friends were all exactly where we needed to be. Heist is a place to get drunk. It's a place that makes you get drunk; it forces you to. It pulls it over on you. I grabbed Hux deep around the waist, snatched her in, foul breath expelling hot between our faces. \"I get it,\" I said to her in a leer, \"Heist... it steals us.\" Hux rolled into my shoulder and purred furious at my chest. \"You're silly,\" she mumbled into my sweater.  I stood there, my girl in my arms, drunk in my veins, blood in my heart, and all this noise and racket of lust and love pounding full and through me. I looked up to see the beautiful barrel of a bartender watching us and grinning. I nodded to him. \"What's your name, man?\" I asked. \"I'm Stefan.\" \"Stefan,\" I said. \"Thank you, sir. I have a feeling we'll be seeing you again soon.\""}

{"text":"Spinach artichoke dip is the way to go because you get a flatbread with it to dip in. Their flatbreads are so delish and filling. I think I've tried them all. Wish I was into their drinks as much as I am their food. Awesome atmosphere inside and love listening to their live music on the patio when it's nice out."}
{"text":"*sighs*  I had high expectations for the brunch buffet that Heist offers on Sundays. TI'll start with the good:  1.  Great for groups, beer, and dinner and lunch.  I've been here before for dinner and the food was really good.    2.  Great location.  Love going to NoDa and the locals are really nice.  Love the people watching and the different groups of friends who gather there look like they're having a great time.  And that's about where the \"good\" stops.  The Bad:  1.  The entrance is a little confusing to find.  We went in the way that we normally go in and just stood there with waitresses and waiters flying past us as we looked like idiots.  I finally asked a waitress and she was kind and told us they changed the entrance to the other side outside.  -__- A sign on the front door would be helpful.  2.  We were sat in the main dining area which was packed and buzzing with hungry patrons.  That was fine.  The part that wasn't fine, was that our table didn't have silverware, and the waitress didn't come to even take our drink order until 10 min after we were sat.  Since it's buffet style, we knew we could just go get food but why go get food when we don't have silverware.  The table next to us had the same problem.  We decided to just get up and go get food since I was starving.  Came back to no still no silverware but the waitress got our drink orders...came back and still forgot the silverware.  -__-  When I finally got it, I pushed my now cold plate aside and we went and got more food.    3. *sighs* The food offered in the buffet was....awful.  Scrambled eggs tasted like they were either liquid or powdered.  The baked brie tasted burned and the chocolate combination tasted like an accident.  Gross.  The salad and dressing were excellent so I filled my plate up with that.  The mussels were cold and just not tastey.    Bottomless mimosas were $12 which we had read in a review that they were $10.  The buffet was $16 a person.  We walked out of there mad and had paid $80 for a terrible brunch experience.  Once the waitress took our drink order, her service was fine.  My thing is, if I am paying for dinner out- it better be good and worth my time and money.  That brunch experience was irritating and I wish we had gotten up and just gone somehwere else...like the table next to us...who left after not getting their silverware.    I'll still come to Heist because they are good in other areas.  I just wanted my brunch experience to match the experience that I had when I'd gone for dinner. I think I saw that I could have ordered from a menu and I didn't have to do the buffet.  I should have just did that."}
{"text":"Ultra relaxing environment with a large selection of both Beers and tapas. I like the constant selection of beers due to the seasoning and customer suggested recommendations. The tapas are a great addition and enhancement to the beer selection."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Heist while visiting for a night. We brought our dogs on the patio, which was fabulous. We got a flight to start and then one beer each afterward. We order the buffalo cauliflower (YUM), the spinach dip and the burger burger burger. All the food was absolutely delicious. The service was awesome too. Very friendly and attentive. A very reasonably priced meal for the quantity and quality of food."}
{"text":"Went here for a work social as they're one of our customers. It was my first time, but I really appreciated their large selection of food and beverages. I did the Caprese flatbread and some beer with a a reference to Goose (as in Goose & Maverick). I'm all for sampling new beer, I liked what I had, but it wasn't stellar but the food and atmosphere are what got me to give four stars. For a large group, I do think their private space (upstairs) could be a little larger. We had approximately 60 people RSVP for our social and I'm not sure the space would have fit that many. Aside from qualities already mentioned, I also appreciated their ample parking and patio. I'll definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of the hottest brunch spots in town. If you're looking for some local brews with mediocre food this is a spot for you. The location in Noda is fun and is great for a little brunch and walking around.   I was disappointed by the selection of food on their buffet. Eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage and mussels that were honestly not stellar. They did have an additional pastry buffet full of doughnuts from Krispy Kreme and other options such as bagels and toast.   Their drink selection is great and the atmosphere is definitely unique since you are in the heart of the brewery. This is my boyfriend's favorite spot so I am sure we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I started coming here when it very first opened and they have definitely come a long way.  The service is always pretty good.  They have a decent selection of beer as well as other drinks from the bar.  The food is always ok, sometimes it is different than others, not as consistent as I would like.    Sunday brunch is great here.  I think I would come back for this over & over again.  One thing that I don't like is they randomly close at weird times, even on weekends.  It seems like you can never predict when they will be open or if they will close early.  I have been a few times on a Saturday night, not really late and they already closed down."}
{"text":"So was excited to try this DDD location but was not overly impressed. Drink menu was ok. Beer cheese was good but not enough pretzel. The other dishes sounded a lot better than they were. Fish tacos were a decent try. Duck confit flatbread was well just ok. Bruschetta flatbread was good for the first few bites then you could tell that it wasn't quality ingredients. Burger was fine. Cuban was just ok. So no real complaints other than they totally forgot to bring out the bruschetta but no real accolades either. Didn't give me a reason to return so... probably won't."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Brewery in Charlotte! Especially in the winter. They have a fantastic inside area and it's easy to get seated. We went for brunch on New Years Eve and stayed for hours, as did most of the people around us. Great brunch drink selection, I would recommend the champaign flight or the man-mosa. For $30 you get to enjoy the buffet, which not only has the breakfast basics, but mac and cheese, pizza and Philly cheesesteaks as well. You also get to order a brunch entree with it. They have a great flatbread selection for dinner. I like the duck confit or the carne asada. The beer cheese pretzels were also a favorite and we saw many people order them. The only negative is that they don't have a lot of tv's so it's not the best place to go if you want to watch a game."}
{"text":"The beer here I give a solid 5. But the food, I can only do a 3.   Some details.  Beer.  Each style I had in my flight was fantastic. So good in fact I left with two crowlers to take back and share with friends in Atlanta. And at 11-15 bucks, it's a solid price point. I tried Thirst, High Fives, mellow daze, ka' kau', and not from concentrate v8. All I would give an Untappd 4-5 rating.   The food was a bit of a disappointment. It is tapas style and I am not entirely in love with this food movement. Great idea but rarely is it done to the point where I am blown away. We had pork tacos, quesadillas, Hummus and crab dip. Any of the meat items had a s sugary sweetness to them that I did not enjoy it at all.  I did not personally taste the crab dip but from two of the members of our table they loved it. Said it was absolutely awesome.   Though I did not get to try everything on the menu I would say that their strength lies in their beer."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent beer, and a great atmosphere. Can't wait until they start distributing outside the brewery!"}
{"text":"The beers on tap are constantly changing, which I love!  The hummus/cheese combo appetizer comes in adorable little tubes (they look like tooth paste tubes).  The hummus/cheese and pretzel appetizer is my favorite thing on the menu. So good!   The staff is friendly and they will gladly change a channel for you.  They will even change it to women's basketball during a FIFA game...that is true customer service.  There are multiple tv'a so no need to worry about interrupting someone next to you or not being able to request the sporting event of your choice be aired.   I hate waiting to be seated and I have NEVER had to wait here!  I would suggest you give it a try.  Not the best place for a romantic date but if you're looking for a casual night this is a great option."}
{"text":"I visited Heist for the first time in a long time for Sunday mimosas. While Heist no longer offers bottomless mimosas because it's against the law apparently. Gotta love NC and its alcohol laws. So rather than a bottomless mimosa, you're given a bottle that's about a liter of mimosa for $12. Not bad. It was enough for me and a friend to split and have about three glasses apiece. These being champagne glass size.  The bartender was extremely nice and attentive. I also had the spinach dip flatbread. It was okay. Unfortunately, only flatbreads were available to eat. However, the flatbread had great flavor and was at no shortage of cheese.  The only negative is that upon pouring my last glass of mimosa, I noticed there was a fruit fly in my drink. It was probably in the bottle the whole time and came out with the last pour. I didn't complain as I had drank the overwhelming majority of the mimosa and survived. No point in making a fuss. So I paid my bill and left."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It seemed like a great place to have a beer and relax.  I tried the San Fran disco, an American Pale Ale. It was great. The service not so much.  The bartender made it very clear that he was the only one working. How could this be? Anyways after waiting nearly 15 minutes for a drink in a place with a total of 8 people we decided not to eat. Bummer because the menu looked amazing."}
{"text":"I have been hearing really good things about this place for a while, but hadn't gotten the chance to try it. Once I heard about their brunch, I made plans that week to stop in, and I am so glad I did.   First off, they do a good job with their signage out front and directing you to the entrance of the brewery. We got there at 11:45 a.m., and it was perfect timing. We got seated within 5 mins and shortly after they went on a wait. $15 for the brunch and $10 for bottomless mimosas, pretty reasonable prices.  The Brunch- I had heard a lot of hype over the food at Heist, especially the Belgian Waffles, so I was nervous I had set the bar too high. Let me tell you, that was NOT the case. Everything was so good, that I couldn't even drink my mimosa because I was so full. The waffles are even better that what you hear (you honestly don't need any toppings, that's how good they are), the French toast- so moist and tasty, I loved the flatbread pizzas and I had an orange Oreo muffin. Yes, an orange Oreo muffin and yes each bite was a burst of flavor in my mouth. Service- AMAZING. Not only is the food fantastic, but the service was equally as good. This place was busy and they maintained everything incredibly well. Each station had a dedicated employee to refill, clean and help people get their food. They were friendly and did a great job. On top of that, there were servers were on top of their tables and checked in frequently. The décor inside is really well done and a perfect fit for a brewery. I love the open lay-out and how clean the look is.  Excited to go back and try out some items off the menu and some of their brews because I obviously will be back for brunch."}
{"text":"Not sure how anyone would rate this place lower than a 5. Beer selection and quality is great and the the food is top shelf. Atmosphere is awesome!! For a brewery to have all 3 in Charlotte is a real catch and need to visit often."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the low rating but I read in a review below that Heist has a new brewer.  This person really knows what they are doing. Everything I tasted was very good. Belgium style beers, some with a little extra malt character, all very subtle and drinkable. I am really glad I stumbled upon this place as I was a little disappointed by a couple other North Carolina breweries. Heist really needs to expand their brewing system and start selling these beers to other vendors. Nice that they have a full bar for those chuckleheads  in your group who don't want to drink these delicious beers....."}
{"text":"Oh how I want to really like this place but I just can't seem to bring myself to do it. Stopped in this week for a bite to eat with the wife. I will say this , they do know how to present food well. I ordered the much recommended Brew Master BBQ Burger w/ the homemade tots. Wow, did it look good! That's where it stopped. Now, I've read that they make the buns in house but I just wasn't impressed at all. First, the bun was cold, not room temperature, but cold. Someone else described the buns as dense and dry, that pretty much summed it up. In addition, it was just a messy burger. Lots of BBQ sauce which tasted great but just got everywhere. I didn't even finish the burger. A rarity for me. I also wasn't impressed with the homemade tots. Even though they had a nice exterior crunch, the potatoes on the inside still tasted, well, very potatoey. Not sure if that is even a word. I've got to say, looking at the menu and seeing what other patrons were eating, it appears there are some great things to try. I still haven't found a beer that blows me away yet. I tried the Red #7 this time and it was good. I'm not rushing back tomorrow but I'll eventually get back over there to experience a few more food items and some brews."}
{"text":"We've been here twice. The first time it had only been open about 2 weeks and was really good, the second time was about a week ago and was awesome. I'll be focusing on the second trip because we were able to try more items off the menu.  We sat at the bar in the back while waiting for a table. While we were waiting we ordered the squiggle nutz which come in a chocolate dipped bacon covered waffle cone* and chicken and waffles* to start. I also had an oatmeal stout which I thought was very good. It reminded me of Left Hand Milk stout more than any oatmeal stouts I can think of but it may be because the nitrogen smoothes it out so much and most oatmeal stouts I've had were from bottles.  Once we were seated we ordered Torched Diablos, Steak and Papaya Martini, Beer Cheese*, Bruschetta Pizza and a couple of burgers. All were very good. I especially liked the beer cheese which was a little thinner than I expected but, that could have been partially because it was somewhere around eleventy billion degrees when delivered to the table. Even after a hot pockets level burn to the roof of my mouth I enjoyed it. I also had a dubbel and red ale with dinner which I thought were also pretty good.  So, there's my review. Now please don't go here because I plan to go back a lot and I don't like waiting for tables.   *Warning: there may also be angel tears or crack in these dishes because holy shit they were really really good. Please avoid if you have angel tear or crack allergies."}
{"text":"Wow.... Every single thing I ate and drank was unbelievable... If I lived here.. I'd be so much chubbier if I lived here."}
{"text":"Def has a traditional German hall feel We each got flights, and let me just say I really wanted to like this place The only one I really liked was the red ale I found the hefeweizen flat/minerally and off tasting---perhaps its the water they use? There was no clove or banana esters at all, very disappointing Wheats and Belgians are my favorite so I really thought I would enjoy their beers but alas they were not ---the saving grace was the delicious, freshly baked (slightly over salted) pretzel Seems like they have a rotating selection so maybe there will be more good beers from them, I love the concept of the idea/ambience/aesthetics I just wish the beers mirrored that ideal"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Heist a number of times and have enjoyed the food every time.  The beer cheese is amazing!  I find myself craving the flat breads that come with a salad on top.  Seriously, I do...    The entire menu is unique (in a great way) including the drink selections.  The brunch selection is large and upgraded from the basic for sure.  If you don't want to try food with a twist on it, you may not appreciate what they offer.  I think it's still worth trying though.    Lots of seating inside and outside and we've never had a problem parking.  Go try it out!"}
{"text":"I'm falling in love with Heist... The food that I've had (spinach artichoke dip with tomato-spinach flatbread, chicken and waffles sushi, beer pretzels, japanese wings) has always been solid... I tried a beer cocktail since they're the only place doing them (in the area, from what I've heard) and it was pretty good... I've enjoyed the beers here from the Hefeweizen to the Dubbel, but I tried the Nut Brown recently and it was a little flat at the end... Other than that, It's been a consistently awesome experience... Just like my favorite server Andrew's mustache. :)"}
{"text":"Heist is surprisingly large compared to how it looks from the street, yet all that space is certainly needed given how popular the brewery seems to be. I'm sure our visit occurring on a beautiful Saturday didn't help things, but the place was absolutely packed to the point where it was almost impossible for me to hear the bartender when I was finally able to make it to the bar - and protip to the dudebro who held up the line: Your date didn't seem all that impressed by you complaining the IPAs (snore) 'weren't hoppy enough'. Unlike the large, cavernous, echoing building the beer menu isn't very lengthy but does offer adequate variety from darker beers and sours to more trendy styles like IPAS (may I never see another one again). Flights, 10 oz pours and 16 ounce pours are all available, allowing you to try as few or as many beers as you like.  The beers we tried were interesting, with a buckwheat saison and raspberry Berliner Weisse being my favourites and my companion preferring the French Toasted Joe stout and Uber Quench'l IPA (why). Beer may be what Heist brews but the cocktail menu was more substantial, as was the food menu. Food offering are the stylish sort of gussied-up comfort foods like multi-noun flatbreads and pedigreed burgers that are accordingly priced more like a fashionable bistro than the typical pub grub one might expect; giving the feel that perhaps it's a restaurant that brews beer rather than a brewery that serves food, though the large, communal tables and proliferation of massive TV sets showing sports events seem a bit incongruous in that context. The space itself is wheelchair accessible but the high tables and chairs greatly limit one's seating choices inside, though the exterior patio should present no trouble.  If you don't mind crowds, sportsball, fancy burgers, dogs, and children with your brewery visits, Heist will have a lot to offer. If those things dampen your drinking experience, they also offer crowlers of beers to go which will allow you to enjoy and appreciate their brews in a peaceful location of your choosing. Either way, it's worth making a stop on any CLT-area beer tour."}
{"text":"Heist sets the bar high for Charlotte. Want to impress someone from out of town with not only a place with incredible food but they also brew their own beer. And not just your typical beer, they go all out!! Your out of town guests will be definitely taking some to go cans or growlers with them in their suitcases.   Heist is constantly winning \"best of\" Charlotte awards year in and year out. They have a wonderful patio fit with TVs in the front and cornhole in the back. The inside has got a downstairs and upstairs fit with 2 bars all with a very rustic feel. Huge windows to peer into the brewery area.   You cannot choose wrong on their food either. The flatbreads get tons of praise as well as their wonderful shareable apps. The menu has so many things you want to try you'll be back in no time because you can't do it all in one sitting. Heist is always pretty busy because of its popularity so come prepared. Grab a drink at the bar as you wait for your table. Their IPAs always impress!"}
{"text":"Do you know what I don't understand? When restaurants ration the ketchup by serving it in little individual silver cups to make it \"fancy\" but you're left wishing the Heinze bottle was on the table.   This especially a bummer when the only decent part of your meal are the fries.   My boyfriend and I have debated trying out Heist for a while now, always swayed by the mixed reviews. We decided to bite the bullet today and unfortunately we're not impressed.   We each ordered the beer cheese burger with truffle Parmesan fries. The fries were amazing. Like I said, they were served with a small tease of ketchup but the fries themselves were good.   The burger, unfortunately, left a lot to be desired. On the menu it sounded mouth watering.  A burger topped with beer cheese, country ham and pork belly brioche!  What we each got was a grey overcooked hockey puck on a roll that was way too thick for the burger and topped with a white substance that Patrick thought was mayonnaise- it was the cheese.   Our server was very nice and the atmosphere was cool but unfortunately those things alone will not do the trick when you're hungry."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great brunch buffet, you want to check out Heist Brewery. They got it right. The food is 5 out of 5-star delicious! They offer unlimited mimosas ($12) and Bloody Marys ($8) for a steal, if that's your thing.   Here's the lay out. Herb-crusted rime rib carving station, pastries, mussels, flaky biscuits and sausage gravy, bacon and turkey sausage, brick-oven pizzas (they put out a variety), eggs, grits, caramelized pineapple with marscapone, cheeses and meats. (I'm sure it changes up, but this was the selection on 3.22.15.) I think there are other items. I just can't remember. I'm still groggy from the food coma.  Here's the kicker! There is a made-to-order waffle included with the buffet. Just let your server now that your down for it. And he or she will hook you up.   Now! Here's the Inception-level kicker! Just when you think it can not get any better. There is an a la carte menu where you can select one additional item to accompany your endless buffet...at no additional charge. And these aren't little eh, shoulder shrug, selections. These are legit small plate, BOOM, this is what we are all about here at Heist type selections. WHAAAAAAT? I chose the short rib and potatoes with a sauce (I forget what kind), opted to hold the fried egg. It was so good.  Go. To. This. Place."}
{"text":"Utterly delicious, but far from healthy! But then again, who goes to a brewery expecting a healthy meal? I was here on a Saturday night with family and friends and everyone on the table enjoyed every single thing that was ordered - food and drinks!  Their cocktails alone are reason enough to visit heist. Go ahead and be adventurous - have a beer cocktail; have the radler. It has Gin & Beer and Fresh Sour and is easily one of the most refreshing beverages I've ever had. If tequila is your liquor of choice - the horny toad should be the cocktail you choose!  From the eggplant tacos to the Mac n cheese flatbread (oh my, sodium through the roof), from the chicken and waffles (omg those waffles!!) to the tofu steak; their vegetarian options were as delectable as the non vegetarian ones. We had zero room for dessert after all the food we consumed!  It's the perfect place for a large or small group, as long as you're looking for a loud venue. Service is great too. Ahh, I cannot wait to spend warm summer afternoons on the patio, sipping on the prefect summer drinks!"}
{"text":"I came here for a drink in the middle of the day and it was a nice atmosphere with a lot of beer choices on tap. The staff was very nice as well. When I came again on a Sunday, I was very disappointed. I was not informed that they only had a brunch buffet before being seated. And after being seated, I was told that the brunch buffet was 19$. Which is more than double any a la carte brunch items in the neighboring restaurants. Come here for a beer, don't come for the brunch!"}
{"text":"Meh. I was so excited to go because the brunch buffet is touted as one of the best in CLT. Not impressed.  Scrambled eggs were dry. Flatbread pizzas were cold. Sausage links were rubbery. Orange juice wasn't freshly-squeezed.  The brewery is spacious and lively and our waitress was great, but the food was truly a disappointment."}
{"text":"Heist is alright, I like the beers. The pretzel sticks and cheese are good. Little too salty & dry but yummy with a beer. Burger was delicious, fries are so salty but tasty. Service was strange ...very  awkward & slow. Lots of kids eating outside & lots of smokers....stinks."}
{"text":"I was pretty happy with my visit to Heist, my daughter not so much. I chose 5 of the 6 brews featured for a flight and my daughter picked a brew because they did not have a cider in house. She's not a beer person so she was disappointed. I was pretty impressed with my selection. My favorites were Hive Fives and Blurred is the Word. I forgot to get a Crowler of both so I'm bummed about that. We ordered an appetizer of Brussel Sprouts and my daughter ordered the Banana Pudding. I liked the sprouts but she did not nor did she like the Banana Pudding. I didn't try it so I cannot say. I feel the staff were very hospitable from hostess to bartender. Bartender kept checking on us and service was great! I will very likely visit again! Next time, I'll try the food!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went for the brunch buffet expecting so much more than was given. Atmosphere was nice and plenty of TVs saved the rating from being a one star. Eggs were flavorless and underdone, sausage gravy and vegetarian gravy both tasted like flour, flatbreads were visually appealing but lackluster with taste. Reading other Yelp reviews would have saved me $40. $20 buffet for each individual prompts at least good food."}
{"text":"Went two times in a week period. This last visit had the BBQ burger and it was amazing... juicy, sloppy, tasty goodness... I got it with a side of the cuke and mater salad... it was sweet more than tart, good but kind of an odd flavor with the sweetness. I finished about 1/2 the burger and a good 3-4 napkins. Everybody else who was trying to eat 'healthy' were very jealous. Instead of beer I ordered a 'dark and stormy' which was good and strong.. one was enough for me. This place has an interesting menu, would definately go back to try a few more items on there. The beer cheese dip is a must."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and location of this brewery. Wish it had more of a patio but overall a great place to eat, drink, and hangout. The upstairs private area is great for a larger party on the weekend nights. Food selection is more tapas, and some weren't quite what was expected, but definitely some unique options to choose from. As a wheat beer drinker I couldn't find much I liked in terms of a draft, however I enjoyed their cocktails!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Good drink selection and beers are much improved.  Unique food menu with something for the average bar goer to the most refined taste bud.  Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Loved the beers. I had a flight and it was really good loved the flat breads as well. The only thing I was not a super fan of was the inside I would have loved to have more bar seating. I felt like most of it was for the restaurant and we came for the beers so did not want to take up restaurant seating. Other than that we loved the place. Woudl  come back and in a neat location"}
{"text":"A brewery that also serves wine and mixed drinks ranked high with me before I even entered the front door.  And speaking of the entrance, wow!  The bar resembles a type of sparkling, intoxicating altar!  Beautiful layout for a brewery.  We sat in the dining area and noted that the stools at the table were hard, small and uncomfortable.  But, never fear, because we were able to exchange them for padded chairs with backs.  Our server was friendly,and he gently offered helpful suggestions.  My husband ordered the stout, which was good, but a little light compared to other stouts.  I had a Cabernet Sauvignon, which was just fine with me.  We shared the spinach artichoke dip with flat bread and a flat bread pizza with garlic, tomatoes, basil and a fig-balsamic vinegar reduction.  The spinach-artichoke dip was creamy and had a nice cheese crust.  The fig-balsamic reduction had a slight sweetness to it, but not overly so.  Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"This was a great stop while visiting Charlotte. The beers were pleasant. Sadly, we didn't get a chance to sample the food as the kitchen had closed, but the beer flight was definitely worth a visit. The artwork was also entertaining-- I spent more time ogling the walls than I did sipping my beer. Definitely looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cool.  It is a bit loud but perfect for group settings or to catch a game with some friends.    The food was very good for the most part.  I didn't realize it was all tapas but they were pretty good portions so that worked well for our table.  We ordered the beer cheese and pretzels and that was fantastic!  The pretzels were fresh out of the oven--soft, lightly salted and perfect for dipping into the creamy cheese dip.  Lip smackin' good!  The 3 dip platter was ok but it was a little challenging to eat.  For example...the \"black bean dip\" was literally black beans.  So they didn't exactly hop on your chip very easily.  The other dip was some type of tomato and mozzarella but again that is not something that you can easily \"dip.\"  So that was a little disappointing.  Everything else was pretty fantastic.  A couple of my dining friends ordered the flatbreads and the mini hotdogs...they seemed to really enjoy them!  My friend and I ordered the special of the evening which was Veggie Burger sliders...3 came with the order which was PLENTY.  They had avocado and some type of yummy cheese and sauce on them and they were phenomenal.  They were made in-house and absolutely delightful.    So here is where I may get beat up....the peeps at my table didn't enjoy the beer.  I'm not much of a beer drinker so my opinion doesn't count.  I won't harp on it but there were 6 of us and 5 didn't enjoy the beer they had.  I don't remember the different types they tried so don't even ask but all I'm saying is none of them were impressed.  T There was apparently one beer that a couple people wanted to try but it was sold out so that may have been the winner!    Overall--good food, good atmosphere, reasonable prices, decent service (our server wasn't that great).  I would come back but definitely want to try a few of the other places first!"}
{"text":"I was already in love with this spot but after going on a behind the scenes tour I love it even more. It's one of those spots that makes you feel proud that it's in your city. I know they're known for their for their beer and lunch but what I love most is Sunday brunch. During brunch you order from the menu AND enjoy a buffet. Not at all continental. A true buffet with a little of everything you would desire on an easy Sunday morning. The place stays packed and buzzing but it never feels rowdy and rushed. I loved the stories surrounding the art and light workings. Please check them out when you're visit. Hopefully your server can share a bit about them with you. Btw the outdoor seating is very per friendly.  Note that parking is limited! Its fits in well with that typical NoDa vibe. It's almost impossible to dislike any establishment in NoDa."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food. Bookmark this spot and plan your visit.   This is a staple in the NoDa area. They have a great vibe/ambience and the brewery is very large than what it appears.   Because there are so many other detailed reviews, I will keep mine short.  1- Get the flight! All the beers we got were very good.  2- Get the crab dip. Get other plates. This is perfect for a date or hanging out with close friends. 3- Service is great. The server stopped by the table almost too much. 4- Parking is hit or miss. Be prepared to walk on a busy night."}
{"text":"I have been to Heist several times since my last review and they definitely deserve an additional star! From the food to the atmosphere I have been extremely impressed. Brunch is great, and the variety of food offered is large and the taste does not disappoint. As for the main menu, all I will say is Chicken & Waffle Tacos, Heaven! The flatbreads are also great.  They offer a good variety of drinks and have a great room for watching a game. I definitely look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"The best I can say about this place is \"meh.\" I've been keeping up with their progress on Facebook since about midway through the construction, but I just  visited for the first time tonight (1/11/13). I wanted to give it a stellar review, but...    It was a Friday night and there was a waiting list for a table (about 30 min. at around 10p ET), which was no big deal. We sat at the bar just inside the door while waiting and had a Stout (Good, but not great) and a Nut Brown (we enjoyed that one more).   We got a table within about 15-20 min. right by the open-air kitchen (with wood-burning oven). First, we ordered the Waffles & Chicken app. I won't say it was cold...it just wasn't WARM. The taste was a nice mix of sweet and savory, but it was a little pricey ($9). Next up were the wings (again, not cold, but certainly not hot temperature-wise). The flavor was good and they had nice charbroil marks...they just weren't warm.   We ordered a beer sampler (5 beers) and the Porter. The wife enjoyed the Porter, but most of the beers on the sample (two Hefeweizens, etc.) didn't knock me out.  The Good? The atmosphere was great, and the Pimento Cheese Flatbread Pizza was VERY tasty. Several of the beers were good as well, including the Nut Brown, the Stout and the Porter (I like the darker beers).  Our server was good. She had a good attitude and sense of humor and checked on us pretty often. I'll likely give it another shot, but hopefully the (admittedly tasty) food will actually be WARM."}
{"text":"Cool, modern style brewery with a nice restaurant/tasting room.  Heist is definitely set up to cater to the sports bar/hipster crowd, complete with tons of sports on the TVs, plenty of beer, and light menu fare.  Went here with the kids and ordered the pretzels (meh), the lamb meatballs (which were a bit spicy, cooked perfectly, and generally pretty dang good) and the duck flatbread (pretty good, would have liked the BBQ sauce to be a bit less overbearing).  Overall the atmosphere speaks volumes, it's a cool place.  The beer is supposed to be main attraction, but it can get lost in the shuffle.  Don't let it, however - it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner last night at Heist Brewery with a friend who had been raving about the decor and the environment of this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised the place was full with a lot of energy nice decor, it has a large warehouse loft feel with a lot of the walls covered with recycled wood pieces. The service was good with plenty of interesting presentation with their food. I wasn't able to get a larger sampling of the menu, but this one is a keeper."}
{"text":"I was surprised by my pleasant dinner experience on Friday night. It's been awhile since I stopped by Heist. And recently I have been hearing comments regarding their food quality changing for the worse (mostly about their brunch, which for awhile was the hottest brunch in town).   My friend and I were heading into Noda on Friday for a few drinks. I thought drinking on an empty stomach was probably a bad idea, so we decided to stop in for a quick bite.   The place was packed, but we were able to get a table immediately (this was at around 8:30pm). Our server (forgot to get his name) was excellent given the busy night. He was upbeat and energetic. It's always nice to have a smiley face server instead of one that acts like he/she hates the job.    We ordered the chicken bucket, which was the healthiest thing on the menu. It's essentially a fried chicken salad in a sweet and tangy vinaigrette. For $10 it's a lot of salad, plenty to be shared by 2 people (or even more). The Baked Lobster & Scallop Cavatapi dish is a little pricey ($22). 2 baked small lobster tails on top of a sizable casserole of cheesy pasta with bay scallops mixed in, it was amazingly tasty. The sauce was perfect. The lobster tails were the best quality, obviously frozen, but at least you get 2 of them. The only thing I found misleading was the \"seared scallops.\" Seared scallops tend to imply sea scallops, but these were the tiny bay scallops, and in my opinion they weren't exactly \"seared.\" It's still good nonetheless.  All in all the dinner turned out to be much better than I expected. With the lack of dining options in Noda (other than bar food), Heist is still a good option."}
{"text":"Beer is not good. Tastes watered down.  Got the pork belly corn dogs and it was all fat not meat, literally, I'm not exaggerating.  The people are nice and the atmosphere is very cool. I'd only come here for the flatbread.  Also, most of their seating is high top stools with no backs. Not very comfy for a meal."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, and good service!  The trifecta.  We had lunch here.  We split the wings as an appetizer.  They were unique and delicious.  The charbroiled goodness added to the buttermilk marinated flavor, and the house made hot sauce was on point.  We washed the wings down with a flight of Heist Brews.  My wife loved the Honey Blonde that is on special now.  I enjoyed the Brunch Junkie the best.  I had the fish tacos while my wife had the Cuban.  Both excellent.  Personal preference I would have liked more pickles on the Cuban, but I'm not the chef.  Fish Tacos were Mahi, and they were perfect to be so far from the ocean.  Loved the Tomato Vinaigrette on my salad.  If I lived in town I'd be a regular.  Our server (Who I think was also bar-tending at the back bar) was excellent.  Wish I could remember her name!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and it was good.  They have a small buffet style serve yourself items,  desert and fruit bar, and some breakfast juices.   The real trick to brunch is to get the included custom made omelettes and waffles.   You fill out a form and they custom make your breakfast.   I got a omelette with hugs and snuggles ( I have no clue what it was) and it was good.  Also, if you come here for brunch make sure you time it right so you can get the bottomless Mimosa's. They don't serve them before noon."}
{"text":"I used to visit Heist more often a few years, and remembered the brunches to be wonderful.  The food was always good, and the atmosphere was fun.  My recent visits are slowly ruining my memories.  While the food is still decent here, it is no longer the top tier cooking, The once lavish brunch buffet feels like a golden corral catered for hipsters.  The standard breakfast items just are not that good.  Drinks are still good but it's just not worth the cost for a mediocre meal.    Beer is fine, a flight provided some good choices, but most were from other breweries.    In the end, this should not be called a brewery - it's a bar that serves food and has a wide tap selection.  The food is mediocre, the prices are a little high, and the parking lot is cramped.  The best thing about this trip was the box of Samoas I got from the crack dealing girl scouts outside the place - I almost ate the entire box on the way home and need more!!!"}
{"text":"The BOMB of BOMBS in a great way,  Natalie was our server,  didn't have to.wait long for refills  we did the brunch buffet.  YOU WANT TO OINK OUT ON a Sunday.  Head over there. Wow great staff never out of anything.   Great flat bread pizzas  amazing BBQ  ham. The gravy biscuits are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"The beer here a few years ago wasn't even good man, but a few years later I pop in here with some local friends and it was amazingly good. Not from concentrate was the best beer I had all day and I had a lot of great beers. So on my recommendation I have been sending my friends far and wide here to try the beer here at Heist. The Duck Flatbread pizza paired nicely with what i was drinking at the time and I love Duck with all my southern heart. So I'm hooked on this spot Duck and great Beer........Delightful !"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, and I'll round down. Read on.  The place is located in the \"NoDa\" neighborhood. They basically took an old cotton mill, gutted it, and made it into a restaurant/brewery.  4-5 stars on the decor and feel. Honestly they did a great job on the interior. Once I walked in here, my expectations were set high.  Our waitress seemed attentive to us from the beginning. Good sign. Made suggestions on the beer...and away we went.  4 stars on the beer. I ordered the Buddel. I read some reviews here saying the beer sucked, but I always feel when you go to a brewery, you have to try the seasonals. This was a good call.  Apps - pretty good. Ordered the hummus. And the crab dip.  But I thought for the price paid, it wasn't enough. Still - I don't think would have changed my ordered as I was happy with my order.  OK - now after the apps...the service kind of went downhill. We came the Friday after Thanksgiving, and I think management just didn't have enough people on staff.  Our main course/lunch just took too long to come out. I mean, it was a grilled sandwich for God's sake (at least mine). By the time I got my order it was cold.  Also - the sandwich was missing an extra kick. Ditto for the tater tots. They both looked great, and they were good....but it was just missing something.  My group also ordered dessert --- the \"caramelized banana eggrolls\" or something. Good concept, but subpar on taste. It looked good - it just didn't have flavor. Bummer.  The waitress also was not attentive to us. Once again - kind of blame the managers. We would have ordered more, but things were taking too long. Glasses of water and more hooch was slow.   I feel as though I should give this place another chance from a service perspective. The beer and decor is exceptional and memorable. But the food -- i think they're trying to hard to create new \"food concepts\" and failing on the flavor. That's something to worry about, but like I said -- if I'm back in Charlotte I'd still give this place a try....just for the decor and beer at least and a chance at redemption!"}
{"text":"Finally managed to make it back to Heist, this time with my daughter for Sunday morning brunch. We arrived shortly after they opened at 10am and by the time we left, the place was filling up. My suggestion is to similarly arrive early for the best service and no wait. Speaking of service, Caitlyn (sp?) was friendly and attentive refilling coffee and clearing plates. Great work!  The brunch menu is simple enough. Order one main course from their menu of a half dozen or so entrees and then you're all-you-can-eat from the buffet and pizza line. On the buffet, eggs, sausage, grits, gravy (two kinds), biscuits, sliced meats, a ham, pastries, bagels, salads and such. I liked the mozzarella cheese balls. Yum.  Pizzas looked like they update often. Flatbread style, I had one with pepperoni that was good but the best was the \"breakfast\" style that had scrambled eggs and bacon on it.  Main course, the steak and eggs was my choice. A small pile of fried potatoes, a good serving of pot roast style beef and a fried egg on top. Nice and delicious.  Good stuff here at Heist. Parking wasn't bad early on Sunday morning but it gets very busy as the day progresses. Consider taking the light rail!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch today.  Taking the advice of yelpers, I got there as early as I could (11:15).  I noticed when I was seated that the restaurant was approx 30% full already.  I was seated quickly in the front bar area.  On the service tip, it did take a few minutes for my waitress to show up to explain things for me and take my drink order.  After placing my order, she directed me to the Library Room where the buffet was set up.  As you enter the room, the bar directly in front of you is home to the waffle station, the omelet station, and the self-serve juices.  To your right will be the buffet.  With the exception of the eggs, everything I had off of the buffet was fantastic.  I had a couple pieces of flatbread, some eggs, grits, biscuits & gravy, potatoes, and the piece de resistance, merengue waffles.  What was on the buffet that I didn't try: warm brie, two other types of flatbread, sausage, bacon, penne & sausage, rum-soaked pineapple, veggie quiche, hummus, orange-oreo cheesecake, muffins, and bread pudding.  As I mentioned, the eggs were the only disappointing item on the buffet.  Everything else I had was top-notch.  OJ and what appeared to apple juice are included in the cost of the buffet.  Later in the morning, the line for the buffet wrapped around the room to the omelet station.  Yet another reason why you want to get there early.  This was my first visit to Heist and I loved it!  Can't wait to come back during the week and try some other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I went to Heist in the later afternoon on Saturday for the Auburn watch party. Heist is the official Auburn bar for football games, and it was packed! I ended up getting a good parking spot - they have a large lot - and getting a seat at the bar. I was immediately greeted by a bartender who was friendly and eager to get me what I needed. I ordered a water. I did take a sip of boodle's (my fiance) beer, which was an IPA. Their beer quality has really improved over the last couple years. I ended up ordering one of the woodfired flatbreads - the sweet and spicy. It comes with cheese, peaches, pulled pork, jalapenos, sriracha, and a pineapple glaze. It was delicious - good mixture of flavors that all seemed to compliment each other. Despite being busy, the bartenders regularly checked in on us. Even though Auburn lost, I had a great experience at Heist and will definitely be back! my only complaint is that it was really loud in there, but I kind of expected it."}
{"text":"I think Heist is great for beer and meeting with friends but for food it is too little for too much.  I have had food here before and it's good but overpriced small plates that can feed a 2 year old."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a beer while on a short visit to Charlotte based on a friend's recommendation.  We sat outside on a beautiful afternoon and decided to make it a lunch.  The beer is outstanding! They do great stuff with both hoppy IPAs and wild ales. We visited several breweries while in town and Heist was the best.  The food was very good. Our table ordered fish tacos, spinach & artichoke dip and a chimichanga. The salad that came with the fish tacos was impressive. We all enjoyed our meals.  And while we were happy to be outside in the sunshine and fresh air, the interior was also amazing; especially toward the back by the brewing equipment. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Full bar, good food, TVs, beer brewed in house.  It all sounds pretty good to me.  They could use more signage from the road.  If you're a first timer you might drive right by thinking it's an animal hospital.  Once you settle in though, it offers a great atmosphere for gathering with friends.  There is an upper level loft type seating area and there are two different dining areas on the main level in addition to bar seating.  The service could've been a little better but it was pretty on point given the type of venue.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had to dock stars, sitting outside eating Benny Pennello's and drinking canned beer from Benny's as well because Heist staff apparently shoos out customers willing to pay for craft beer 40 min BEFORE official closing. Best part, as we're eating outside we can see all 3 of the servers having a jolly ole time themselves, drinking at the bar 20 minutes before official closing time at midnight.   Bummer. Will rethink coming to Heist for a brew night after tonight's events :/"}
{"text":"Heist is a vast vision of a restaurant for the NoDa area. It's not JUST a brewery, despite the sneaky little name. There are a couple of other breweries that are only breweries just down the road. And they do a great job of brewing beer.  But Heist is not just a bar. There are some bar staples...and a Charlotte must-have: pretzels and beer cheese. Chef Rob is also pulling out all the stops with adventurous menu items like shrimp and lemon-wasabi cotton candy, compressed watermelon, flatbreads with key ingredients like duck and veal cheek. It's not your run of the mill brewpub, ok?  Because Heist is so high profile and newer than some of the other breweries, there appear to be mixed reviews in terms of the beer. I defy you to spend 5 minutes with the brewer, Zach, and come away anything but baptized into the Heist beer family. I'm a fan of the I2PA, but I recently had a Hefe that I didn't hate. That's a miracle for me.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the cocktail menu. That's one place where Heist shows up every other brewery-style restaurant I've experienced. Their bar staff are on point, friendly and always whipping up flavorful, inventive creations straight from the brilliant mind of award-winning mixologist, Stefan Huebner.  Recently, the Mr and I ventured in for brunch, since we had heard good things. It was around 1pm on a Sunday, and we were ravenous. My appreciation for the buffet-style offerings are as follows: vegetarian options galore, waffle and omelette station, bread pudding, fresh fruit, etc. At only $15, it's a Charlotte brunch bargain. We opted for a carafe of sangria and were very pleased with our choice. Just what the doctor ordered on a Sunday after church.  Also of note, the interior is really easy on the eyes. Very creatively broken up into spaces that make it feel at once cozy and austere. You really just must experience it."}
{"text":"OMG the food and drinks were so good! Very pleased for a late night spot. The prices were right for the quality of food. Very good"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and lunch and have enjoyed each visit.  Last time I was there for lunch we each got a flight of beer.  Our server was great and helped us each pick our flight.  The food was delicious, lobster mac and cheese as well as the fish tacos and tots were both phenomenal.  Great brewery, I will be back again."}
{"text":"Heist is probably my favorite restaurant in NoDa.  Lots of good appetizers, like the pretzels and cheese, and a solid selection of beer and cocktails.  Ironically, I am lukewarm on craft beer, just saying craft beer kind of annoys me, but I still like this place.  I even made it to this place for brunch one time, and it was really good.  I probably could have eaten 10 belgian waffles. The highlight in my opinion is their trivia night, though.  We just went a few Wednesday's ago and these 2 guys who MC'd it were awesome.  It wasn't regular trivia either, there was price is right and jeopardy games for the trivia, so it was a lot of variety.  It is definitely the best trivia I have been to in Charlotte.  I can't wait to go back again.  The aesthetics and service was really good, too.  Not a huge fan of the NoDa area, but this place is great."}
{"text":"Ugg, I'd like to hope it was just an off-night, but Eeeeeek.   Quoted 30min wait, ended up 45min - not bad tried to seat us inside, but told them we wanted to be outside then seated at a table that had been empty outside since we arrived...   we had to ask 3 times for a server to even get water  beer didn't come until about 10min later  our server Clayton was GREAT! He was attentive and got us things as fast as he could, but I get it the place is packed. The upfront wait and host just put a bad taste in our mouth from the beginning, sad face...  The food was alright, but if you're looking for a true micro-brewery this is not it. It's more of a cookie-cutter restaurant that happens to brew beer - not the same vibe as the other breweries in the area at all."}
{"text":"Super cool place. Love their beers. Bartender was really cool. Didn't get any food but the menu looked awesome. Will definitely come back when I have more time!"}
{"text":"They fired their old brewer and fixed the old watery beer, Beer fans, give them a shot and try a flight.  Beers are interesting, varied in style & *CARBONATED!* (If you knew the old heist brews you would know why such an obvious thing is noted in all caps.  Overall there are well done beers on tap, to generalize they are light on hops overall and on the dry side which isn't a negative for me. After a flight of every beer on tap I would (and did) drink a pint of at least half of them, which is very good. They have frequently changing small batches which a nano-brewery absolutely should be exploring, and they are taking some chances making some experimental beers. All in all the beer has become what I expect of a microbrew gastropub, an interesting experience of beer. I'm excited to keep coming back for more beer, hopefully they keep on their toes and keep exploring and growing.  I'm not a huge fan of the new tapas menu, it seems a bit limited and Heist's food was quite good before and Noda is already lacking enough places to get a full dinner. Though I could see this as a great place to get some apps and some beers while hanging out and getting a bunch of friends together, No longer a full dinner spot, still great environment to hang out with a bunch of friends."}
{"text":"Love coming here great place to hang with friends !! Great food and drinks as well. Good place to watch games as well!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. Service was terrible. My husband finished his food in its entirety before mine even touched the table. When the food was delivered there was 0 apology. She just dropped the food and left. She was impatient when taking my order and really didn't give a crap. Service was very poor. Drinks were average and only 4 beers by NODA. As a small business you survive on reviews which are based on customer service, I would think they would be grateful for the business and respectful. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Oh, Heist. I see the potential in you. The brunch was okay.   You get one entree item and then the buffet. The buffet was cool. I got the 'Oink Oink Omelet' and it was just okay. A lot of egg, not a lot of cheese. I liked the buffet though. Plenty of options. Some are hits, some are misses, but at least you've got options.  They seem to run out of things often, which is odd. They ran out of glasses and sweet tea all before noon.  As far as drinks are concerned, I thought it was fun that they rang a bell to let all the early drinkers know that there were about to release the Kraken, i mean liquor...liquor."}
{"text":"Visited Heist back in the summer and had a great experience. Service was welcoming, Beer was nice and varied, eats were delicious!   Came early on a Friday with the hubby and shared 3 plates (lamb meatballs, duck flatbread and 1717 hot wings) and we each had our choice of beer. The food was so good!   Everything came hot out of the kitchen. Meatballs were sizzling with gooey ricotta melting nicely over the 3 large meatballs. Wings were large (4 whole wings) and flatbread was plenty.  I did not find the portions to be too small in relation to the price. The quality of the food was great.  Flavors were intense. We like to eat and we left nicely stuffed.  I plan on returning soon. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went here with my Husband for his 24th Birthday on a Wednesday night. The ambulance were inside with a guest on the floor. That made us pretty nervous but we had planned this first visit for so long. We were hosted and sat on the upper level. The stairs were kinda scary with me being pregnant, going up and down to use the restroom. We tried the flat bread, waffle tacos and burger/sliders. All was delicious. Would be nice to visit again with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I kept hearing mixed reviews about Heist, some would rave and others would say the beer is just 'Ok'. The other day and stopped by on a busy Saturday night. We could find parking and after walking in, there was about a 45 minute wait. Not a big deal, I expected to wait a bit.   What a cool building. Everything from the outside to the lighting above the bars, the exposed brick and wood everywhere you look. Beautiful. They did a top notch job on the décor. I didn't take a look around the whole place, but from what I saw I loved the style. We waited at the bar where I had a blueberry beer.  I liked it. I ordered a peach beer but they were all out. The hostess and bartender were both very kind.   Once we sat down our waiter was awesome, very attentive. We ordered a few apps. The duck quesadillas, burger sliders and mozzarella balsamic flat bread. I wasn't a fan of the first two options, the food seem like it was trying too hard, but I did enjoy the flat bread.   The staff and décor get a 4 in my book the food a 2 1/2. I heard that the menu has recently been redone. I would go back and get the menu a second chance."}
{"text":"Good food and good beer but.....it is so loud you can't carry on a conversation.  Food menu is very limited.   Hostess was not trained in Service Dog etiquette and law- when we said we wanted an inside table and, for a second time, identified the dog as a Service Dog, she had to go talk to manager and then hurriedly put us at a corner table that had not been cleaned or reset.  It has been a while since we were there and I'm not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and beer! Really enjoyed the potbelly burger, very flavorful. Also, have to get the tator tots- homemade. Also, pretzel sticks are good as an appetizer.  Beer is good, cool staff, and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Heist maaaaaay have just knocked Toast down to my second favorite brunch spot. Went last weekend for their Sunday brunch ($15 all you can eat), and it was amazing. They had a great variety of food available (not just run-of-the-mill breakfast items), set up buffet style. Sometimes when I'm hungry and hungover, the act of choosing/ordering is overwhelming- enter Heist. Genius! The only downside...word is out so you'll have a wait but its totally worth it!  Oh and I love their dinner menu/vibe as well- can't really go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"We ended up here because we wanted to go to NoDa Brewery but didn't realize it wasn't open up until 4 PM. Note that while this place is called a \"brewery,\" we later learned that it's actually just as known for its food/specialty cocktails. Perhaps if we'd known that beforehand, we would have approached our visit differently.  The price was solid ($7 for a flight of beers), and the outdoor patio was fine. Otherwise, it was a pretty underwhelming experience.  (A) For a brewery, the beer wasn't very good - the flavors overpowered the beer itself. For example, the \"Shepherd of Fire,\" which has habanero in it, was mostly just spicy and even left my throat and stomach with an unpleasant burning sensation for an hour afterwards. Similarly, the \"Winter is Coming\" tasted like somebody had dumped a pack of Big Red in it, and the appropriately named \"Note Overload\" was way too fruity. My buddy and I were arguing over which one of us had to finish the flight, something that never happens.  (B) There were two TVs and one was broken, which meant we got stuck watching some lower tier college basketball game that one guy in the entire place was interested in instead of Champions League soccer. When we asked if we could go into the other room (which had additional TVs), we were told that it didn't open until 5.  (C) The staff was not the friendliest. My waitress seemed annoyed when I asked her to pick out my flight for me, rather than excited to talk about the beers. Actually, now that I think about it, I don't think she even bothered to explain why she picked the beers she did - she simply handed me my paddle and a card with the names of all the beers.  We went to NoDa afterwards and enjoyed it way more - if you're going to a North Davidson brewery, I'd recommend that one instead, and there are plenty of beers there to keep you occupied."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my brunch! We were in a decent size group with a small baby and they were great about accommodating us! Since it's a buffet it seems that table turnover is slower than a normal restaurant, but they were great about putting tables together and making it work.   As for reviews that mentioned food not being served hot, I did not experience that at all. Everything that should have been in chaffing dishes was, and the staff was great about keeping all the food stocked. The buffet line can be long at times, but it really just depends on when you go up. The made to order omelette was a great option, though no one at my table ordered one.   Overall great experience, and would be five stars if only North Carolina could serve alcohol before noon!"}
