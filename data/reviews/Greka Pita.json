{"text":"So yummy!! I was initially bummed when my go to Greek place closed a couple months back until i found Greka Pita, now i am so thankful it closed!  Time after time, Greka serves amazing food!  The owners are kind and their food is delicious and consistent.  I am 100% obsessed with their Persian Tea.  Try it, they should bottle it!!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was good, wish I had some more feta on the Greek fries. I did enjoy the falafel and the chicken. The service took awhile for take-out but it was still an overall good experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! I love gyros and they make a good one but I wish they put more meat on them."}
{"text":"Great food...great taste. Ordered the chicken shavarma and curry chicken platter.. tastes great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to get a gyro in Phx - So hard to find good/real Greek food here.  Usually stop by at lunch time - great staff, great food"}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!!!!!! Always great service. Fast hot food on my arrival. My husband and I eat here at least once a week since we just moved to the area. The Gyros are amazing!!!! They remind me of my favorite gyro stand in NYC!!! Must try!! You cannot beat the price eaither. I get a regular gyro my husband gets a jumbo gyro meal and it's under $20. And enough food for us, even with a little one growing in my belly!!"}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant with a good selection of food. They have all the typical Mediterranean style food but they also have some extras which is nice. I had the falafel pita which was very good. The iced tea they have is also good,it has a nice floral flavor and is unsweetened.  I was greeted very well when I came in and taken care of as I ate my meal."}
{"text":"This place needs to be shut down. The Hummus taste like a bowl of soup, watered down with no flavor. The shawama taste like my Aunt Betty made it & shes from Nigeria. It was on a super small pita. The best thing was the fries & the Snapple. The place was unclean, it looked like somebody got tired of the tziatki sauce & threw it on the wall. Dont do it...who ever gave this place 5 stars are missing taste buds."}
{"text":"Place is terrible.  Food,awful.  Undercooked falafel, over processed babaganoush, gyro salad oily with no flavor, and terrible service.  Guy cooking was more interested in texting, than the quality of his product. Waste of time and money"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma was excellent! Not spicy at all thank goodness! Hubby got the gyro and that was excellent as well. Very nice people (owner?) they let us in even though they were closing. Great place! Better than grinders!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's got an interesting menu, and the shawarma is pretty good but I just watched the man behind the counter make a dash to the corner of the dining room, grab something and move even faster, waving his arms toward a car backing out of the parking lot. A lady had left her purse at the table. This man instinctively noticed it and acted. I don't know if he's the owner or the manager but what I do know is that this man is a fine example of human behavior and I believe he needs recognition and patronage. Come visit Greek Pita, have shawarma, ramen, udon, a gyro, edamame, rice bowls, a burger or even a salad. Seeing this simple act of humanity made my day after a long shift in a busy Emergency Room. I'm glad I stopped here on my way home after work. I will do it again."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff, the food is great, and you get a lot of food for very little. I eat there once every coupe of weeks. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very decent lunch spot, favorite thing to get here is the spicy gyro pita. I don't think I've seen spicy gyro at many places, and this one is pretty great. The Asian fare is ok, it's what you would expect- not great, but definitely not bad either. Pretty decent value for lunch."}
{"text":"I wish I would have written a review of this place when I loved it. The other 5 or 6 times I've been here. This time, something is TOTALLY different. I always order the same thing, regular gyro meal with fries or a salad depending on how I'm feeling. Or, I'll order the chicken shawarma with fries or a salad.   I immediately noticed there was a possibly Korean woman cooking (she stepped out of the kitchen to watch me while I was ordering ). The lady behind the counter was also unfamiliar. It definitely wasn't the same family that operated the place before. I ordered the chicken shawarma meal with a salad and a side of falafel. The chicken smelled absolutely delicious but it was soooo tough and dry. The falafel taste like it was fried in the same grease Chinese food is cooked in. If you've ever had fried chicken wings from a Chinese spot then you know the taste.   I also noticed that not one single solitary person was in there besides me. Before there was always at least 2 other people dining or ordering. This time, no one. Most importantly, they're now selling Korean chicken and veggie bowls. I took a few bites of everything and was preparing the leave. The lady behind the counter asked if I needed a box and bag to go. I declined and asked if they have new owners. She said yes! I'm thinking possible in the future it won't be Greek Pita anymore. *Sad Face*"}
{"text":"pretty bland for schwarma, the rice had no flavor either, I was surprised to see asian on the menu, not something I would think would fuse well as cuisines go. very friendly staff and the place was clean, I just didn't blow my hair back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Greka Pita for lunch. We both ordered the gyro special ($6.99 for gyro, fries or salad, and a drink). The food was excellent. Gyro was well seasoned, all the ingredients were fresh and delicious, and the fries were excellent. The man at the counter was very polite as was the man who brought our food out to us. Overall, a great experience. We will definitely be back to try some of their other food."}
{"text":"Great flavor, fresh ingredients and friendly staff. I usually get the Greek salad with chicken and extra feta but I also like the spicy gyro if I'm in the mood for something a little less healthy."}
{"text":"Love the Gyro.  A simple little place.  Did not like the humus..  no way even close to like.  Frys were done well and tasted great!  So far a place to hit on the way home or lunch.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to Sedona. We were not disappointed. The jalapeño hummus was memorable. We could not stop eating it. I had the spicy gyro & my friend had the regular one. They were both superb. Best gyro I've had in a while. I would recommend stopping by if you live or are passing through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious!  chicken shawarma, salad with yogurt and rice. Hummus everything was good. I was surprised how tasty it was. Highly recommend to try"}
{"text":"Great tasty food. Love the chicken shawarma platter and salad. The fries are the best in the area. Owners are extremely customer service oriented. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not value for money. Chicken shawarma was good. But, most of the food feels like reheated and place is deserted even during lunch hours. They need to improve quality of food and presentation significantly"}
{"text":"My wife ate here yesterday...she had the Original Gyro...said that it was an awesome lunch...and a nice place to eat outdoors!"}
{"text":"A welcoming experience. The man at the counter greeted my boyfriend and I with a smile. We ordered the gyro special. $6.99 for a gyro, fries and a drink (I had the greek salad.) Everything came exactly how we ordered. I asked for no feta on my plate and the man was considerate to ask if I had any other related food allergies. We ordered to go. When our food came he double checked to make sure there was no feta on my dish. Super sweet of him. The gyro had a clean taste to it.The fries were crispy and a decent size, not those thin classic size we often see. My salad was a good portion, better than most greek salads I've tried. The place was inviting. My boyfriend was thrilled to watch the Suns game on the flat screen that hung from the wall along with the beautiful photos of Greece. We'll defiantly be back."}
{"text":"The guy at the counter was really nice. I was happy to find a place that had healthy food (not to me tips delicious green food in particular) open at 9am. That extra hour earlier than most restaurants open around this area made all the difference for me and because of that I will be returning! The place was very spacious and clean. The menu was clear and organized. They were friendly. The food was great. I like that they had several options for vegetarian food as many Greek places do. And they make the food themselves instead of hiring Mexicans to fry their food for them like most other establishments. I am happy to support a restaurant like this!"}
{"text":"Yup,  I'm  at it again. Took my mom in to try the falafel. Still tasted as deelish as the past few times. I love that the food is consistently prepared the same every time.  Now I have a full belly and am one happy camper."}
{"text":"I popped in here for lunch the other day after a meeting in Central Phoenix. It has a great central location near 16th and Camelback and I can NEVER say no to Greek food! I ordered the Greek salad with chicken and a side of tzatziki and pita. Unfortunately, I had to send the first salad back due to wilted lettuce and dirt on it (I'm not just talking one piece...about half of the salad was like this!). They were extremely friendly and replaced the salad immediately. The second salad was quite good and I loved the light dressing that they put on it. It definitely could have used more veggies and feta! The chicken gets 5 stars for sure. The spices and marinade were incredible. I am sure the pita sandwiches are a better option at this restaurant. All in all, I have other Greek favorites in the Valley so I may not be back but if you are in the area and craving Greek food, Greka is worth a try!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place during my lunch break and it is excellent. The food is an awesome fusion of Mediterranean and Asian. Incredible customer service, quick wait times, and delicious food. Try the Bulgogi Bowl with fries some time, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Sometimes, the craving for a gyro and baklava takes me by storm. I saw this place had recently opened, and it was time get my fix.  The owner was behind the counter - incredibly friendly and excited to talk about his food. I asked for the gyro and baklava, and asked what else could I not live without  - he told me the chicken shawarma was incredible, so I ordered that, as well.  There was nothing *wrong* with the gryo - and the menu does describe it as \"thinly sliced.\" Maybe I should have asked him to qualify that. It was shaved meat, not sliced meat. The flavor was spot on - but the texture was just...odd. And - my fault - I don't care for lettuce on my gryo - just the meat, tomato, onion, and tzatziki. The menu said lettuce - I should have asked for that to be left off. (It's impossible to get all the lettuce shreds off of sauced shredded meat.)  The chicken shawarma was okay - again, nothing wrong with it. But it was a bit too heavily seasoned. To the point I couldn't really tell it was chicken.   The baklava was perfect - and I will be back to check out more of the menu. Next time, I will ask the owner if he can slice the gyro a bit (a lot) thicker - more like the consistency of every other gyro I've ever had anywhere - and hold the lettuce. Based on the flavor of the meat - I would definitely go back for that!"}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about greka pita. I LOVE greek good, and this place is legit. From the owners, to the shwarma. Please give all your money to this place because I eat here like 4 times a week."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on my lunch break this week - I had the falafel wrap for $7.  The falafel itself was pretty good, but slightly overcooked. My main issue was the staleness of the pita bread. At first it seemed fresh and soft, but as soon as you lifted it with everything inside, it cracked and split down the middle, spilling all the falafel and toppings back into the take out container. Better quality, or fresh homemade, pita would definitely elevate this place to a solid 4 stars. The tzatziki was passable, but a little on the bland side.  Overall: a decent to-go sandwich that's maybe more accurately valued at around $4.99 than $7, and VERY friendly service from the family that runs the place. I'll probably go there again, and try the gyros, and maybe even give the falafel a 2nd chance.  I've had better, but I've also had a lot worse...so 3 stars is about right."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch in the middle of the work week where I found many other patrons doing the same. For that reason, it was a comfortable environment to be eating lunch alone and not be disturbed with lots of noise. The food and prices were really satisfying. I had a craving for chicken swarma and was really pleased with the simplicity of this establishments meal. It was exactly what I wanted and the man at the register was very friendly. It's kind of hidden in the corner but if your nearby I definitely reccomend!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hole in the wall with pretty great food. I went for the first time and got a traditional gyro and my boyfriend got a chicken skewer pita, all of which was very good. I also got a Baklava that was delicious. Nothing was out of this world, which is why I can't give five stars, but I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time for lunch and ordered a tabouli salad and chicken shawarma with a side of garlic sauce. Great service and friendly counter help but the meal was probably the worst tabouli and shawarma I've eaten. Shawarma no flavor, tabouli full of bulgar filler with almost no parsley. The \"garlic sauce\" which is usually a white creamy paste was actually liquid with some chunks settled at the bottom. No bread. All this and a drink for $10.00. Never again!"}
{"text":"Yum...we stopped in for a snack yesterday and I was wishing it was for a full meal.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dolma with cucumbers and tomatoes on the side.  It was the perfect snack to hold me over until a big dinner later that night.  The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean, the menu had all the best greek dishes and the prices were reasonable too...so, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Closed on a Sunday evening. Instant single star, never returning."}
{"text":"The hummus was gravy, the pita bread came right from the store bought package, and the chicken shawarma tasted like nothing. Sad face.   Customer service was excellent! Very nice Persian family runs this spot. I got my order in right away and they were very helpful. But the dish was so awful I thanked them quickly and had to run out for plan B meal cuz I just cannot stomach the food."}
{"text":"I stopped by when i had business meeting at downtown Phoenix, i wanted to try some shawarma, I thought the place will be a little nicer but for the price you pay it reasonable, i will recommend it for togo order more than dine in. The Jalapeño hommos was little runny but very tasty. I might try it again when i am close by."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Sharma plate with half salad half rice. Chicken and salad were great!!! Rice was whatever. Ordered a side of hummus which was plain and would not recommend. Guy at register was friendly oh and came out fast"}
{"text":"All the traditional dishes are true to form and authentic. No mayonnaise or sour cream used in their dipping sauces/hummus.The chicken was flavorful and fresh."}
{"text":"First time in this place and we will defiantly order again! The food tasted fresh and the protein were big! I gave it 4 out of 5 due to the fact their Greek fries are just the regular fries topped with cheese with no other seasoning."}
{"text":"First time I've experienced a blend of Greek and Korean influences, and I'm a fan.  It was very good.  So yeah, not everything was traditional or \"authentic\" Greek, but it was all very good and the variety was fun.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My first and last time here. I didn't like the taste of the salad dressing or the Tzatziki. The chicken wasn't flavorful and I bit into one piece with gristle and a bone."}
{"text":"I just ordered their gyro and hummus with pita. The quality was terrible. The tzatziki had spoiled and had a terribly acrid unpleasant taste. The hummus was lumpy and didn't taste like much of anything. The gyro meat was more greasy than I've experienced at a Greek Restaurant before, and the tomatoes were pale and mealy. They need some serious quality control. I called to let them know their tzatziki was rancid so hopefully no one gets sick."}
{"text":"Great place for a bite to eat  We were looking for a quick and light lunch when we came across Greka Pita . If you enjoy Greek food, you should try this place.  Greka Pita is the real deal, their food is really good, the restaurant is clean and inviting, the staff is acomdating, in fact you will feel right at home when you walk in.  My lunch companion and I both ordered the gyros with fries. The gyro meat was nicely grilled, tender, seasoned perfectly, and the tzatziki sauce was absolutely delicious.  The portions at Greka Pita are large, prices are wallet friendly, and ingredients fresh. On my next visit I am going to try the pork souvlaki.   If you're in the mood for Greek food give Greka Pita a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Greka Pita was terrific. Very friendly owners. Super Clean. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Really impressed. Great food. The falafel is some of the best I've ever had and the spicy euro is beyond delicious. It's weird to say this, because almost all edamame tastes the same, but the edamame I got here is now my favorite. I've lived in the area for two years and just tried this place, but it will be a frequent spot of ours for takeout dinners."}
{"text":"I've been hankering for some Greek and since I missed out on the festival I was happy to find Greka almost tucked away.   The woman who greeted me, I'm assuming the owner, was very friendly and welcoming. I ordered the chicken and beef platter, which she brought to me along with cutlery and napkins. The meal itself was good, but for the price couldn't be beat.   I'll definitely stop by to grab a gyro again sometime."}
{"text":"Delicious pitas and their fries are delicious and fresh as well. Their not your typical thin ones. Their seasoned and thicker. Their very friendly and bring your food to your table if you dine in."}
{"text":"Great little spot for when the Greek craving is knocking on your tum.  I followed the lead of my friend and went for the vegetarian platter which was just delightful! Two plates of delightful in fact! There were 4 dolmades (yum), two falafels resting very comfortably on a bed of tabbouleh (excellent), accompanied by pita bread, tahini, and excellent hummus. I enjoyed everything on the plate!  The prices are fair and the servings pretty generous IMO.  They did use styrofoam for dining in--I know this is a less expensive option but it puts many people off."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far.  I've gotten the regular Gyro and the spicy Gyro.  Both were great and ready really quickly!  The prices are spot-on (unlike another nearby Greek restaurant that charged $8 for hummus!)."}
{"text":"Greka pita is the kind of hole in the wall place that I love to eat at.  Don't come here if you are looking for fancy decor or gourmet recreations of Mediterranean food. Come here if you want good tasty healthy food for a decent price.  Gyro was perfection with lightly toasted pita, meat yummy, the sauce creamy, veggies fresh.  What more to ask for when you want a cheap, healthy lunch?"}
{"text":"This is a strange fusion place I think.  Decor is Greek photos and fake bonsai trees?  Menu is Greek and Korean?   I got the Gyro lunch special. Not bad but between the meat and fries I felt my fingers full of salt.  Time for blood pressure medication!  Staff is friendly and food is hot but this won't replace my favorite local Greek spots.  No Opa here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and got the lunch special, gyro with fries and a soda for $8.99. The gyro was really good, the fries were well cooked and hot, and my order only took a few minutes. The place was fairly crowded for Tuesday lunch and some were obviously regulars. If I lived locally, I'd probably be a regular too."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED: 2 words. Before I share this magical combination of yummy deliciousness go ahead and make sure you're sitting down and not driving. Ready?  SPICY GYRO!  There. I said it.   Holy schnikes. It feels good just saying it. I better be careful because my mouth is watering profusely just recalling this for you here and now.   They take regular gyro meat and throw it in the grill with Sriracha sauce. The end results is perfectly crispy and spicy gyro meat. They make the rest of the gyro exactly like any other gyro. Lots of freshness, including veggies and tzatziki sauce. The pita was perfect.   Everyone who worked there was extremely nice and friendly. They are conveniently located right off Camelback and have ample parking.   As Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"I'll be back\" and I will be ordering the spicy gyro. Bam!!!"}
{"text":"Got the Beef and Chicken Shawarma with 1/2 rice 1/2 salad. IT WAS SO GOOD!!!! Definitely found a new spot for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and love it! I have had the Gyro, Shwarma, Salad and Fries.  All of which were super delicious.  This place is kind of hidden and I have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  Now that I have tried it, I will be back.  Great service too!    Dont forget to try the ice tea, its got a kick to it,  a chai like flavor.  Super refreshing."}
{"text":"Love the philly style gyro! The owners are super friendly. We want to try other items but the gyros are so perfect we get them every time. Want to try the ramen."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade food every time! The Greek House Salad is so fresh and tasty, dressing is perfection. Great Gyros too! I come here whenever I come to this part of town to shop."}
{"text":"Just paid $9 for chicken shawarma plate. Came with a salad where the lettuce was not cut into pieces less than 5\" long. It was not served with any dressing. Chicken was dry. Said the plate came with tzatziki sauce, but none came with. Portion was very small for a $9 plate. Kids high chairs all were filthy. I usually review places when I really enjoy something and hate to be so negative, but almost $40 for 2 adults and 2 kids was WAY overpriced for the quality received."}
{"text":"Not very impressed.  I had been before it the food was fairly decent but when I went last Sunday, the other I got was no where near what I ordered and all I could taste was cinnamon.  I ordered the beef Shawarma  but got some chicken thing and some dried out gyro meat that tasted more like cinnamon toast than meat.  And for this we waited well over 20 minutes with no one at the counter ahead of us.  The girl spoke so softly you could barely hear a word she was saying and clearly, the last thing on her mind that day was working.  Bad service and a meal I threw out after one bite.  Should really be a one star but the rice didn't taste bad after I heated it up (it came stone cold)."}
{"text":"What a great place...chicken shawarma pita was  a little spicy and outstanding. Tzatziki was tasty. Side Greek salad delicious. Even the homemade ice tea was a treat.   What are you waiting for....GO!"}
{"text":"Although this place may not look like much it has a lot going for it. They have a combination of Greek and Asian food. Meatless options for anyone who doesn't eat meat like myself. There is something here for everyone and the flavors are on point. I won't lie we have passed by many times but decided to stop in last week and here I am back again. I recommend for a quick bite. It's not a fancy place but the food is what we come for!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  I've had a lot of Greek food and this place is a great value.  Don't overlook this little gem!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced and very tasty Mediterranean food. I can't wait to try other things on the menu. The food quality changed the next time we went. It was not as good as the first two times."}
{"text":"Pleasant staff , with soccer playing on the tele. Pretty wide section of food  . The salad was gyro meat so much food . From what I can tell with people around me everything comes stacked so you will leave full. Now the pricing is pretty normal . The special was a gyro with your choice fries or salad and a drink for 7.99. A salad with meat and a drink ran me 6 bucks . But if you are in area, or waiting for your partner to finish shopping at last chance I recommend going to this place"}
{"text":"Great food and service every time we have eaten here! It's usually empty or pretty close to it, but don't let that deter you, it just means less wait! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is just because the weekend hours are a little inconvenient, it seems to be closed anytime we try to go to dinner here on a Saturday or Sunday."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today. I ordered a gyro and chicken kebab platter. It came with rice and greek salad. The rice had good flavor and the meat was cooked perfectly. The gyro was slightly crispy and the chicken was just right, not dry or overcooked. The baklava was good too. I enjoyed the meal a lot. This was my first visit and there are many other things on the menu I'd like to try. I recommend this fast casual Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's located in a shopping center with horrendous parking but always worth venturing in for falafels. The staff is nice and it's always clean."}
{"text":"Wanted a gyro but immediately became concerned when I saw a Korean bbq menu too. Surprise it was really tasty. Person behind the counter was super sweet and nice, they had Sunday specials score! Will upgrade my stars once I try Korean food"}
{"text":"Oh this is stellar! Family owned and operated, reasonable prices. I go and get the Greca Salad, basically a Greek Salad with Gyro meat on top. I could probably eat here everyday."}
{"text":"My second time being here and I have to say I was beyond impressed with the customer service. From the moment I step in the door they greeted me. Not to mention they guy working there was so patient, friendly and most of all very helpful with the menu. He made the whole experience go so smooth. Ones he brought out our food he ask if we needed any ketchup etc. Which I could easily get up and get it myself. Very nice of him to go that extra step.The food was delicious and no complaints what's so ever. I have to say there was other customers in there as well and he made sure everyone was getting the exact experience. A family of 4 was dining in and he notice forks where needed. As one of the kids where getting up he offer to get them.Overall I have to stay I am beyond impressed with the awesome way they run the restaurant not to mention it was very clean."}
{"text":"The food (Gyro Combo Meal) is absolutely fantastic! Next time I visit I will get their Korean BBQ plate. Customer service. Made a positive difference to my experience as well. Original called with a special request, and it was met with a generous kindness and a welcoming smile.  Thank you for walking out to my vehicle and making it possible for me to enjoy your food and service.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Not from Phoenix, but didn't want to be shopping hangry! Excellent gyro special with salad or fries and a drink for $7.99. Must be a local favorite because the Uber eats delivery guy said sometimes he just sits in the parking lot to get the next call."}
{"text":"I eat here multiple times a month.   The food is fantastic and very moderately priced.  People who come here and give it less than 4 or 5 stars, don't know good food when they see it.  I have eaten this type of food from Iraq and Kuwait, to Nebraska to AZ and I go out of my way to stop by and eat here over other places closer.    DELISH."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Mediterranean food, this place is a disappointment, the chicken shawarma wrap had way too much turmeric. The man at the counter who may have been the owner, gladly replaced it without any questions for a chicken kabob wrap. Unfortunately though the chicken was very tender it was the complete opposite of the shawarma - totally flavorless. The accompanying  tzatziki sauce was jelly thick. Their beef or lamb might be better I'll never know I won't be going back. Sorry Greka."}
{"text":"I was craving some Falafels and i decided to stop in. It was empty, which is never a good sign. But i went for it anyways. I ordered the Chicken Shwarma(for my daughter) and the Falafel platters with half rice and half salad.  My food came out pretty fast and the presentation was promising. I took my food to go and as soon as i got to the car i could not help but to dig in. Everything, i mean everything was super bland. The rice, the falafels, the hummus......#blandasfuck. The only thing that had any hint of flavor was the tzatziki sauce. I am super pissed i pay 24 dollars for some whack ass food.  I give this 2 thumbs down and some sea salt to season the food."}
{"text":"Meh. I confused this place with another gyro place down the street that is just as mediocre. The falafel was gross, but my gyro was just OK. Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad.  We stopped here after work to grab a quick bite.  I love Greek food so I was excited to try a new place out.    I tried the chicken shwarma pita wrap and a side of Greek fries.  I have to say I was disappointed.  There was plenty of food so portion was not a problem.  The chicken wasn't bad but just didn't have the flavor that I have seen at other similar restaurants.  The Greek fries came with feta but had no oil on them so they were pretty dry.    The staff was friendly so no issues there.  I can't say for sure I would stop in again but who knows.  Overall, not bad but not great either."}
{"text":"Amazing gyros and they have ramen option here too! Come try it out. Not to mention- they have a Korean beef BBQ dish!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!  The meats are so tender, the veggies fresh, and the dolmas and falafel were incredible...a must try!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Shawarma plate!  Generous portions and moist chicken.  Reasonably priced and portion size is very satisfying!"}
{"text":"Anyone saying that this place has great Greek food, has never had real Greek cuisine before. The food lacks flavor and seasoning, there are no garnishes served with the dishes, and the food is vastly overpriced, especially taking the quality into consideration."}
{"text":"I saw this place opened right next to my nail shop, so I decided to grab some lunch after my mani/pedi. They describe their food as \"healthy Mediterranean cuisine\".  They have most of the regular items you'd expect to find at a Mediterranean restaurant, but they also have sandwiches that have nothing to do with Mediterranean food (e.g., Philly Cheese Steak, Tuna Salad, etc.).  I'm not sure whether that's good or bad.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with half basmati rice and half salad (French fries are also an option).  It comes with a side of tzatziki.  All in all, it was a pretty good meal.  I would call this Mediterranean-light -- similar to Pita Jungle, which is fine in the middle of a workday, as I'd be asleep in my office if I ate heavy Mediterranean food at lunch.   It's a nice addition to the area, and will be my regular go-to for lunch after my pampering time."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Love the gyro with some fries combo reasonably priced. Never been here before but I would recommend coming here for lunch or a great afternoon meal. They gave salads and some other things on the menu I'll have to try i like greek food so yum :)"}
{"text":"I stopped here after doing a little shopping at Last Chance. It was friday night around 6:45 and I could not believe it was completely empty!! not one person in the restaurant. The lady behind the counter was so sweet. She let me order a sandwich with gyro meat and falafel mixed together. The sandwich, fries and a drink were about $8.   The sandwich was delicious. The fries were average. The hummus was a bit bland.   One thing that I usually dont like talking about in reviews is the restrooms. HOWEVER I cant keep my mouth shut about this one. It was reallllly gross. The floors looked clean but that is about it. The toilet and the urine need to be cleaned BAD.... like reallly bad. It kind of made me lose my appetite.  I may go back to this restaurant, but will never use that restroom again."}
{"text":"Fist time here. Very nice owner. I had the beef and chicken shawarma platter with rice and salad. $9.99. Very good price. I will be back to the restaurant again."}
