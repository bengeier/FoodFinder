{"text":"Delicious take out Indian food at India Bazaar Sweets  As you know, I am a combo of Bangali and Tamil cultures & grew up in Delhi. My mom, an amazing chef made sure that we developed a taste for Punju food & made it often in addition to the regular Bangali and Tamil food at home. So, when given an opportunity regarding what I wanted for dinner after a day of sightseeing I immediately jumped at the opportunity of take out from ' India Bazaar Sweets'.    If you are imagining a fancy desi restaurant then let me tell you that this it isn't so as this is a small little outlet in a desi grocery store. They sell mithais, samosas, pakoras, thalis and other Punju dishes. I ordered a vegetarian thali which included Naan/Roti, Rice/ Hakka Noodles, 3 vegetables, 1 dessert, salad and pickle. I chose naan; rice and the 3 vegetables were Saag, Shahi Paneer, Baingan and Gulab Jamun for dessert. I was asked to wait 5 -7 mins as they had to make the naan. I browsed the store while I waited for my order to be ready.  As we were super hungry we opened the box as soon as we got home and noticed that thanks to the compartmentalized take out plastic thali the food hadn't shifted and thus there was no mixing of flavors between the Gulab Jamun and Shahi paneer. The naan was huge, super soft, tasty and still warm, the saag was plain with just onion, ginger and butter which made it creamy, the paneer was soft & the balance of flavors in the gravy was perfect, the Baingan ki Subzi was a mash up of Bagara Baingan and Baingan do Pyaza. The accompanying jeera rice was soft yet fluffy/khila-khila and the pickles were tasty too. And by the time we reached the Gulab Jamun we had high expectations and thankfully we weren't disappointed. Each and every vegetable dish was full of flavor and delectable and a treat for the mouth.   If you are looking for a good take out place where you can get delicious desi food at a reasonable price then head to India Bazaar Sweets (formerly known as India Bazaar Fresh Pik's). And if you want to enjoy the dine in experience, wait for a month and their restaurant will be up and running. They are located at 10405 Kennedy Rd N Brampton, ON L6Z 4N7. Parking is free and there are lots of parking slots so finding one shouldn't be a problem. The staff is courteous and very efficient ensuring all orders are handled in a professional manner.  They receive 4.5 stars in SRM's book."}

The large is $13.99, but it can last 2 people more than two meals each. Pair it with some $1.49 plain naan and you got yourself dinner. It can be pretty spicy so beware!   Tip: You don't need a flavoured naan because the butter chicken sauce will overpower it"}
