{"text":"China Delight is by far THE best there is around, and the couple who own it are the nicest people you'll ever meet! They put love into the dishes they prepare; and everything is always super fresh and tastes delicious!!   I love the Chicken Chop Suey with Lo mein.... (Typically it comes with rice, but I love Lo mein so I don't mind paying a little more for it!)    Enjoy!! :-)"}
{"text":"This is not one of our regular places but nothing else was open so we decided to give it a shot.  As another poster noted...  We waited over an hour and the food was still not ready. 4 different dishes (3 of them spicy) tasted exactly the same- like nothing at all. Crab Rangoon had *maybe 1 teaspoon of cream cheese, definitely no crab. Egg rolls large, almost exclusively full of cabbage with a few tiny bits of pink mystery meat. Wonton soup flavorless and without any noticeable meat or filling as well. A huge amount of food for a small price, but no one wants to eat it because it just wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great portions.  And the nicest husband and wife you'll meet.  Always have a great experience.  I eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Service was good on phone and in person. Food was ready fast and the prices were typical of Chinese. We ordered a wonton soup, a crab Rangoon, and a large chicken fried rice. The wonton was good. The Rangoon tastes ok but like it had been sitting around a while. The fries rice consisted of rice, chicken, egg, onions, sprouts, and scallions. The rice was bland. Now don't get me wrong it wasn't bad tasting it was just bland. Added some soy sauce to mine and my wife added some sweet and sower sauce that they included with the meal and we were happy. We might go there again but will likely try other places in the area for a more tasty meal."}
{"text":"Sad to say, china delight was NOT delightful.  Called in a take out order and was told it would be 30 min. It took 1 hour and 30 min. Had to wait in the car as the heat was off in the restaurant. Was comped 2 cans of soda as apology for the wait.  None of the food had any sorry of \"Chinese\" flavor. Or any flavor at all. I think they forgot the seasonings conpletely.  We ordered: sesame chicken (more breading than chicken. Very thick and overly sweet) general tso's chicken (same as sesame chicken but with a mild heat) mogolian beef and beef with broccoli (these 2 dishes tasted the exact same. The broccoli was good but the beef in both dishes was bland and tasteless and chewy)  chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice (again tasted the exact same, bland, tasteless and while the shrinp were a very nice size you could see the black vein that hadn't been cleaned. Gross) Veg lo mein (lots of veggies but NO flavor) crab rangoon (normally stuffed with crab and cream cheese, these had a tiny dab of cheese with no crab or flavor) shrimp egg rolls (these are very large but i only found 1 miniature shrimp at the bottom) egg drop soup (bland and watery) Kung pao shrimp (large shrimp but not cleaned and very tasteless) Each dish had a decent amount of food but it didn't matter as no one wanted to eat much of it. I'll keep looking for a halfway decent chinese take out on the west side. China delight is definitely is NOT it."}
{"text":"Was a nice little place, takeout was okay, nothing amazing, but was still very good. The couple was nice, but they do seem to have some trouble understanding English, like many of these places do. Overall not bad, prices are decent, and food was good."}
{"text":"My favorite chinese restaurant. It is family owned and operated, and the food is delicious! You definitely get more than what you pay for :-) I recommend trying the shrimp lo mien!"}
{"text":"This place satisfied everything I look for in a Chinese restaurant. The food was done quick and at a very high level.  I got an order of general Tso's chicken, an eggroll, and a small bowl of wonton soup. Total bill $6.25 at lunch. How can you go wrong?  Oh, and two very enthusiastic greetings upon arrival, and a warm thank you for your business on exit. It might look suspect from the outside, but it's a small hurdle to get over for an outstanding Chinese food experience.  Probably would only use take out though."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great egg rolls, love the wonton and egg drop soups, and I have to fight my son for the crab Rangoon. The owners are very friendly people and they always recognize me.  Once they even threw in a crab Rangoon just because they know I love it! Our go-to place for Chinese"}
{"text":"SOLD!  Owners have sold to China Renaissance, who takes over Feb. 1st.  This nice older couple served excellent food - and reviews show that the new owners will serve up to the same expectations.  Cant wait to give them a try!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, OH so much. I really did. I've been on the search for that perfect chinese place in the area for two years now. Foo Sing is awful, IMO. They were good when they were next to Best Buy, but their new location just isn't the same. So on the hunt we've gone. We really like Thai Spice on Center Ridge, albeit not really Chinese.   So we decided to get on Yelp and see what's good. We chose China Delight because it's very close to our house and had excellent reviews on Yelp.  Ordered over the phone, using a menu from Google. As of October 2015 the menu on Google is NOT the menu in the shop. Basically the woman told me they used to have a dining room and that menu was then correct, but since they've closed the dining area and swithed to only takeout they've made the menu much smaller.  The woman on the phone was incredibly nice. She made sure I knew where to find them, was very helpful. We ordered: Crab Rangoon, Wonton Soup, Eggroll, Sesame Chicken, and Hunan Triple Delight [not on the actual menu but on the Google menu.]  When I arrived to pick up it wasn't quite ready, no worries, that means it's fresh! It appeared we were the only order. Which was depressing because it was 7pm on a Saturday. The couple was SO nice. Just great people. They inquired about this being my first time, they were just so generous. Our food came in a great big box [that doesn't make me look like a fatty] and they gave us ample sauces and fortune cookies. You could tell they had pride in what they do and wanted us to love their food.  But we didn't. Oh i'm so sad. I judge a lot of chinese food based on the wonton soup. I'm on a never ending hunt for the best Wonton soup [Currently found at Taste of Orient on Ohio State's campus.] This wonton soup was odd. The broth was phenomenal, I loved it. But the noodles...they were noodles, they weren't dumplings. No meat filled. Maybe to cut costs. Still a very good soup, in my opinion, just not your normal wonton. I would order it again because it tasted great, but it just isn't what you would expect from Chinese takeout.   Crab Rangoons. Not good. Just...not good. No filling. basically just a wrapper with nothing on the inside. Came with a sauce. I understand skimping on the faux-crab, just fill it with the cheese. They really weren't worth eating. Came with 6. I think I ate two and couldn't bring myself to eat anymore.  Husband had eggroll. Said it was a very good eggroll. I think that was probably the highlight [seeing by some other reviews they agree they're good.]  Entrees. Standard chinese. Tasty, worth getting again. Both got fried rice. Not worth it. Dry, no veggies mixed in. I don't really like rice anyway though, to me it's filler food. So don't judge solely on this.   I feel terrible because the owners were just so delightful. It seems like maybe times are tough so they're skimping on quality/fillings. I can't believe they weren't more busy - they're the only chinese in the immediate area. Unless you count the [what looks like an awful] new chinese buffet down the street. I really wish success for them, and for their personalities alone we will probably come back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, son and I kind of stopped here on a whim last Monday night. It was raining extremely hard and it ended up being the closest place around at the time. My girlfriend has ordered lunch takeout here before and I didn't even know it existed until she told me to stop there to pick up some dinner that night. Let me be completely honest when saying that this place is a bit of a diamond in the rough. The interior of the establishment is a beat up but the smiles of the family who work there are wonderful. The \"mother\" who took our order was extremely sweet and even offered my 3 year old son a sucker and a fortune cookie while we waited for our food to be made (make my kid happy and thumbs up to you). \"Father\" and \"daughter\" were both whipping up our order which came in a large box to go. We went with a combo for 3 people (girlfriend's sister was at home waiting to eat as well), which consisted of 3 entrees with fried rice, soup, and appetizers.   We arrived home and dug in. We started with the wonton soup that was bland in my opinion. The wonton's also weren't filled with anything and were essentially just noodles. I will add that my girlfriend and her sister both enjoyed there soup, it just wasn't for me and I let my son have half of mine. The appetizers came with Crab Rangoon (average), golden fingers (like a chicken finger, average as well) and an egg roll (kind of weirdly spicy, but enjoyable). Our entrees of sweet and sour chicken (pretty similar to any other Chinese joint), General Tso's (not spicy enough, but ok) and Sesame chicken (light and delicious) were all up to par. I did not enjoy their rendition of fried rice. It was extremely bland and not good at all.   I really like the charm of this little Chinese joint and I will be back because of how well my family and I were treated when we came here. I would stick to takeout as the restaurant on the inside is a bit small and not the best for a sit down meal. The food isn't stellar but it is one of the better options for casual Chinese food in my area (Crocker Park area). Next time I would get the Sesame Chicken, WHITE rice and an egg roll. I'd also pass on the Crab Rangoon and try the pot stickers instead. Give it a try, especially at lunch time where the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Great egg rolls.  Super-fresh bundles of flavor.  Best we've had in years.    Some places have been way off the mark---hard leather-like wrappers, nearly raw filling, grease bombs, suspiciously re-fried, etc etc, or way overpriced for the bland results and in the diminutive proportions of half-smoked cigars.  Here you get tasty, incredibly-priced, substantial rotund rolls---not something the size of your thumbs.     If thinking of grabbing something quick and inexpensive, why not pass on yet another pizza, or drive-thru tacos and burgers.  After ordering, in ten minutes or less you can be crunching through China Delight's hot and steamy egg rolls, instead.  And just because they're listed under \"Appetizers\" on every Asian menu, I've never yet read that there was a limit of only one per person.  Two or three of these chubby rolls can easily count as a crispy veggie-filled meal in itself.     Theirs are so fresh, after re-heating them the next day in a toaster oven, they tasted like we had just ordered them.    1.  Cut cold ones in half lengthwise, but not all the way        through---open-faced.   2.  Nuke 30-45 seconds on high. 3.  With aluminum foil cover filling ONLY, and bake at        300-320 for 3-5 minutes.         They'll be moist inside and crispy on the outside.   4.  Pour on the sweet and hot mustard sauces. 5.  Start inhaling."}
