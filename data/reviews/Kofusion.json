{"text":"The night I went (a Sunday night) was packed with young trendies.  The food was not bad, especially the Phoenix roll, but don't go there expecting authentic sushi preparation.  The prices were moderate. The best thing was the beer selection.  I also had a very pleasant waitress who took the time to explain the food selections.  Overall, a good place to go."}
{"text":"Order-up + kofusion = slow service (50+ minutes every time) and incorrect order 3x times in a row. Now, we do all make mistakes - I get it but 3 strikes - I'm out.   Add salt to the wound, order up's poor tracking service and response times are disappointing and frustrating.   Competitors take advantage of the lack of auditing, systems and poor follow through!"}
{"text":"I had the 10 Sampler pieces on dollar sushi night (along with other things) and although a few pieces seemed to be like American-ized fails like the chicken fajita, popper, and and another with beef and barbecue sauce, and something that was fried? the normal rolls were OUTSTANDING. The Big Roll and (the pretty one with a little dot of spicy mayo) WAS TO DIE FOR. The dumplings were unbelievable and the green tea ice cream was crazy fresh. I literally cannot wait to eat there again. I want to eat there every day."}
{"text":"All I can say is, this place much too overpriced for what it's trying to sell. You leave feeling like you were ripped off rather than satisfied.  Sushi was very below average and I found the selection of nigiri sparse.  I don't think it would have been as upsetting if it wasn't so expensive, but even if were priced less, I still cannot say that it was delicious.  My bf and I had one drink, one $15-16 maki roll (only five pieces on the plate though), nigiri (2 pieces at 2 bucks a piece), and sushi plate B (which had very few actual sushi for the price) and it was around $70 something. I could not believe it because that was my grocery bill for the whole week and I got a measly meal. We both left still feeling empty in the stomach.   I'm not a super chef, but I know how to cook and even to make sushi myself.  The rice used was not right. Sushi rice is not the rice you just scoop out of your pot or rice cooker rolled into shapes. There is a preparation process for the rice which adds rice wine vinegar, sweetness, and brings out a slight chewiness that complements the raw fishes and whatnots. KoFusion didn't even do this. The fish was not very flavorful either. The amount of rice used for the nigiri was about 2/3 the proper amount. Rolls were shot with a shrink ray. Everything was just off.   The decor was really, I dunno ... just very odd. It's the like uncool kid trying to be really cool. There was neon, walls with bubbles, odd colors, tiles, weird blue lighting, odd shapes. I dunno, maybe this is what is \"trendy\" back then or something but it looks really odd to me.   The waiters were fine. i was surprised to hear that our waiter has worked there for over two years. She knew what she was doing.   I'm not looking for heaping portions, exquisite tastes at dirt cheap prices. I just want a good portioned meal, tastes good to the average person, and at a reasonable price. KoFusion missed the mark on all of them.  Maybe it was just that night or because of new management. I remember KoFusion actually used to be good several years ago.  I was shocked to see how different the quality of food that is being served now.  Small portion, wallet shrinking, bland and poorly made sushi. Oh and odd decor."}
{"text":"Limited menu but nice presentation and preparation. If you like Sushi, you will enjoy kofusion. Unfortunately we went with someone who did not like fish and she had a difficult time finding something to order. This was my third visit. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I went to Kofusion on Monday, April 23rd, just before 6 and met my friend and her two sons for dollar sushi night.   If my friend and her boys weren't already there, I would have turned around and left. I got a really bad first impression. It was busy (but nobody else was at the hostess station) and the hostess asked me if she could help me. I said that I was looking for my friend and her two young sons. She got really snotty, rolled her eyes and said, \"Well, you're just going to have to look for them yourself.\" Maybe she was just having a bad day. Who knows. I walked around and still didn't see them when another hostess came up and asked if SHE could help me. I told her who I was looking for and she goes, \"Oh! I know right where they are, come with me.\" She was cheerful and really helpful. It made up for the other super, rude hostess.   We had the best waiter I have ever had in this town. No kidding. I saved my receipt so I could remember his name. It was Luke H. He was super attentive, extremely polite, friendly, and really sweet to my friend's kids. Our drinks never went empty and he checked in on us plenty without being annoying or hovering.   Being dollar sushi night, I expected a longer wait for our food but our rolls were out quickly. They were all really good, too. The edamame and dumplings were great, also.   Super big thanks to Luke H. and the NICE hostess. Hope the other one's attitude improves."}
{"text":"Went there on Monday for Dollar Sushi. We were sat immediately (yay) and had a great server (ask for Zack.) Tried everything twice and enjoyed the hot sake bottle. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and while the food was delicious, their service was horrific. The servers were rude, impatience, not helpful and kept on taking their sweet time - was frustrating.   Like I said, the food was pretty good and they have a nice variety of options for sushi lovers and non-sushi lovers alike."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for dollar sushi! So amazing and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Nothing excites me more than the idea of $1 sushi; but when one can't get waited on (even after you are served a different drink than you've ordered), nothing else matters. Here's to hoping that Sushi Kame can pick up the slack!"}
{"text":"i haven't been to this place in a long time, so i decided to try it again.  i guess the easiest way to sum it up is a sushi place that wants to be a nightclub.  if this were a \"genre\" people were expecting, it would hit the mark.  if you have a group that wants sushi, it is probably the funnest place out there to go.  and it is tasty.  i'm giving it only three stars because of the desserts.  i lOVE desserts.  i thought i might get something more authentic, but the desserts didn't even seem made in-house.  just made in a factory somewhere, which is not what anybody wants, really."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is terrific. The interior is replete with huge fish tanks with lights that keep changing colors, and a waterfall. They also have a large outdoor garden.  My boyfriend lives in NYC and Chicago for many years, and says that this is the best sushi he has ever had.  I normally order a korean noodle dish. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are wonderful, but they use chili oil instead of fresh chilis, so it makes it too greasy.  If you adore chocolate, you must must must order the Valhrona chocolate gelato. You will realize you have never really eaten \"chocolate\" before!  The service can be a little slow, even when the restaurant is not busy, but the servers are knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Generally overpriced and so-so service. Not worth it. I was brought the wrong beer and was overcharged and the waiter made me feel like I was cheap for pointing it out. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Place was packed, service was great! Our table had white dragons, lamb chops, big rolls, variety of sushi & caviar . I loved this place! I'll drive the three hours to go back another time."}
{"text":"Not for people who actually like sushi. You can tell this is for people who don't give a shit and just want to spend way too much money on tasteless rolls. Waiter had no idea what he was talking about. Miso soup had nothing in it. Not vegetarian friendly. Veggie rolls had no flavor."}
{"text":"We have complete household agreement on five stars here. Came here last night for an impromptu nice dinner and sat on the patio enjoying the warm summer evening. Yes, the food is pricey for Champaign. We had sushi, the special steak, and two salads, a smoked calamari salad and a Prairie Fruits goat cheese salad. The salads were excellent. The sushi is the best in Champaign (and you pay for it, because it is fresher, hence higher transportation costs). My strip steak was one of the best composed steaks I have ever had: lovely sauce, perfect accompaniments, nicely cooked (cf. steakhouse steaks, which I also love, which are a big hunk of meat, grilled, w/ some kind of potato on the side -- go to Jim Gould's if you are in the mood for that kind of meat in Champaign). Nice, small list of wines by the glass. Delicious creme brule: best ever, any restaurant. Knowledgeable, attentive service. Only quibble, my idea of rare is rarer than their idea of rare, but their rare worked very well with the steak and the sauce."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. Atmosphere leaves much to be desired - imagine an 80's dance club with an underwater theme- filled with CU's yuppies who think this is the place to \"See and Be Seen.\" We went for \"Dollar Sushi\" - each BITE is $1...not each roll. I know sushi can be expensive, but I thought it would be something more of \"Chef's Choice\" trying to use up what wasn't purchased over the weekend. You're better off going a different night to avoid the crowds and just order the rolls you like. The rolls themselves were decent, but not the best I've had."}
{"text":"I have a couple of things to say about this place.  First - this place is light years better than Miko, even thought they're owned by the same people.  That doens't say much, however, since Miko's food sucks big time.  I love Ko Fusion sushi - it's creative and the ingredients are top notch.  But seriously, the price is ridiculous considering Sushi Kame makes rolls almost as good for half the price and none of the attitude.  The fish entrees are always good here, but stay away from non-asian dishes - especially pastas or anything Italian.  You would do better with a frozen dinner and I'm not kidding!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's due to summer but I am less than satisfied with my lunch meal I just consumed - speed of service was too fast for fresh Korean chicken and it was rather tough and chewy, even the crispy coating fell off and the taste was only so-so. The big roll sushi pieces have shrunk in size (one bite size instead of two previously) and to top it all off as each dish was delivered there was no exchange or communication whatsoever. Just bang the plate down on the table and then they take off - not likely to return to this location again as I don't feel they care about their patrons!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I thought this place was pretty good. Seeing that everyone was complaining about the prices and saying that it was overrated, we came in with low expectations. We only had sushi off the $1 menu and some how we ended up spending over $50 (we ordered Nobilo wine and a few appetizers as well). We enjoyed the sushi so much that we got a second order of sushi. Being from California, the prices of the sushi were really no surprise to us. The place was pretty clean and the decor was very modern. There was seating out side but my girlfriend and I still haven't acclimated to the humidity so we resorted to the indoor conditioning. Overall, a pretty cool, trendy place to get a sushi fix if you need it."}
{"text":"I went for dollar sushi and the service was horrible!!!! The waitress doesn't serve us drinks till about a minute before the food gets there (and thats that one of us only wanted water.) On top of that they didn't bother to look that we didn't have any chop sticks!!   The sushi was only ok for a dollar a piece. For all of that I might as well only get sushi from Siam Terrace where they have $5 sushi rolls (6 pieces)."}
{"text":"To start any review, we need to first highlight what our review is based on. This is based on Food Quality, Dish Presentation, Ambiance, and Customer Service. Let's go in order of the list.  Food Quality- **** While I consider myself a traditionalist when it comes to food, this is a fusion restaurant and therefore needs to be assessed in tandem with other fusion restaurants of this type. I've had my fair share of fusion sushi restaurants and roll houses, while this one doesn't exactly take the cake, it is still very good albeit a bit pricey in some cases.  Dish Presentation- ** For a restaurant based on a somewhat pricier setup, one would expect the food to be presented equally well. While this is the case with many dishes, some like stir fry for example is just a bowl of cooked noodles so note I'm not assessing that one in particular. Oftentimes when I ordered the dollar sushi(single rolls), I've found them to be inconsistent and at times even deformed. The only thing I expect is for my rolls to be...you know, round. Sometimes they look more like a gear than a roll.  Ambiance- *** Not bad at all. I'm liking the contemporary music paired with contemp art and a nice blend of color patterns. I would argue that the one abstract picture right above the drink fountain throws off much of the consistency of the rest of the restaurant, but still, that's a personal inference so take it with a grain of salt unless you share my opinion.  Customer Service- *** By design this restaurant has few instances where you can really critique their service, so I'll highlight the major points that you do interact. At the cash register, and upon receiving food. I've encountered an about equal number of instances where the cashier was warm and friendly, or impatient looking possibly yearning for their break. I'd argue that poor outweighs good, but for sake of argument let's say they're exactly equal in magnitude and average out at 3. Upon receiving food, you will commonly be asked if you need anything else or whatnot, but that is basic protocol and nothing to be impressed by, but still very much appreciated. That earns a 3 as well.  To those who took the time to read this entire review, I thank you profusely, and wish you a good day. I hope this review helped you make a more solid judgement call, or if not at least added some perspective to your decision to eat/continue eating here."}
{"text":"From friendly, quick, and efficient customer service to delicious food, KoFusion brings a lot to the table in the sushi bar industry. On top, most of the staff are college students, creating a very comfortable, student-friendly aura. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Although KoFusion claims to sell only wild-caught seafood, this is not true.  For example, they serve Kona kampachi, which is the brand name for a fish sold by a farm in Hawaii. On top of that, they do not label which fish is farmed and which is wild. So, the only thing you can do is ask.  And, I would also ask whether the meat you're ordering is actually organic, because if the restaurant is willing to mislead their customers about the fish, I wouldn't trust them about the meat either!   Why anyone would want to patronize a restaurant that has so little respect for the customers that it lies to them about about what's on the menu?"}
{"text":"Incredible. Only word needed. Good service, terrific sushi, just a great place. Went during one of the dollar sushi days and was very impressed."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has so many bad reviews... This is one of my favorite places off campus to eat. The sushi on mondays is only a dollar a piece- and you can mix and match! The environment is pretty cool too- and you can sit outside.  If you are sushi lover, this is the place to go to in champaign. For people who dont like sushi, they also have just plain food that's great as well. Great Date Place Too!!! Can get a little pricey depending on what you order, but for the most part, the food is worth it. Never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"This place has really good tea, esp the jasmine tea. The food seems overpriced."}
{"text":"+ too fancy and complicated rolls, menu sometimes not clear, overpriced, awful design inside the restaurant (feels cold and dark) - nice outside sitting, ok service"}
{"text":"I tried this place last night with my girls for the $1 sushi. I was a little worried after hearing mixed reviews on yelp and in person, but was pleasantly surprised. Our server was probably the most attentive I've had so far in C-U, but I don't know if that was because it wasn't very busy (the undergrads haven't gotten back to campus yet) or because I was with 5 very attractive female grad students. In any case, drinks were always kept filled and the sushi came very promptly. There are drink specials also on Monday nights: $3.50 bottles of sake and $4 glasses of wine, about 4 each to choose from. We had the hot sake and I had a glass of the Riesling, which was nicely balanced (not too sweet.. very nice for sushi). There were ten rolls available for $1, and we were not required to order all ten of them. I tried one of each except for the organic beef and the alfredo roll. My favorites were the big roll and the crunch roll, which was topped with a nice spicy sauce. The rolls were not very large for being \"special\" rolls, and I definitely would not order one from the regular menu (some were listed as high as $23 for one roll?). It was really fun to go and pick and choose and compare with my friends though. I will be back for $1 night! With wine, sushi, and tip, I spent $23 and was stuffed!"}
{"text":"I go to used to go to Ko 2 to 3 times a month for the dollar sushi nights (Sunday AND Monday).  Dollar sushi nights used to feature around 10 rolls at discounted prices, each week a few of the rolls on the dollar menu would differ from the ones offered the week before.  The service was HORRIBLE, but the sushi made up for it and at $1 a piece you are paying around 70% of normal price (and since they are so overpriced at Ko to begin with this meant you were paying what you would pay anywhere else).  Lately I've stopped going to Ko for several reasons.  The dollar sushi menu no longer changes.  It is nearly CONSTANT from week to week.  Sure it's a super discount so you can't complain too much.  However, sometimes some of the sushi you order comes to the table reeking of fish.  The pieces are $1 because clearly the fish is old.  And finally the service is utterly horrible on Sunday/Monday nights.  Sure they are busy, but the wait staff simply suck.  To sum it up you can get sushi that is just as good and just as cheap at several other places in Champaign/Urbana.  Branch out a bit, trendy neon lights that change color don't mean the food is good."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food, very tasty sushi! I enjoy the lunch buffet, even better than Miko's used to be. The dollar sushi on Sunday and Monday is pretty decent, too."}
{"text":"First, the positives: The sushi is actually very good! Also, if you want to splurge on desert, the ginger ice cream is good, too. I ate here with my family and, as I did, they all enjoyed the food.  Unfortunately, that's all I have for the positives. The food, as good as it is, is overpriced. The atmosphere (which I admittedly can't speak in detail about since we were sitting outside) seemed...I don't know...off. However, by far the worst was the terrible service we received. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but our server really seemed to cop an attitude toward us and took FOREVER tending to our needs. Twice, someone from my party actually had to get up and retrieve him from whatever he was doing so he could actually, you know, do his job. This really should not happen, especially at a place that bills itself as such an upscale, better-than-the-average-restaurant kind of place.  This really soured what should have been a great experience. I may give this place another chance some time. However, it'll be a while before I do. I guess if you really have a hankering for sushi, you could do worse. Just be aware of all the crap that comes with it."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay, but overpriced for what is essentially a self-service place. Service was slow and they got our order wrong, although they did apologize and make it right. Middle of the road in a town with plenty of Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"I really only go here for the $1 sushi night, can get pretty pricey otherwise.  Love the monday night sushi specials, they make up a menu of 10 rolls that may not be traditional but are absolutely delicious like a grilled kobe beef roll or a roll topped with salsa.  I always order the \"sampler\", a hot sake, and some edamame to start off.  They also have more traditional stuff for purists and a large organic menu of seafood-restaurant-style dishes.  Haven't found any other sushi place in town that is as good.  And it has a really cool almost over-trendy atmosphere, so it's a place you can go to for a special occasion or just whenever."}
{"text":"This place has totally acceptable food, some of it rather tasty, and it's super pretty inside. But gotdamn, it's expensive. I'm not used to the sushi prices here. I've lived in bigger cities with better sushi for super cheap. You can't do much better than this place in this area, I guess."}
{"text":"Arrogant, unnattentive waiters, poor service, unfortunately the best sushi in town.  Over the past month I've eaten $40+ meal THREE separate times during dollar sushi and received poor/horrible service. Each time, the waiter either forgot about us or didn't realize we were there, OR forgot to give us basic things like chopsticks, ginger, etc, and we waited another 5-10 minutes before my fiance went to the front to ask for some.  After the third afternoon this happened, I brought it to the attention of a waiter who discussed it was dollar sushi so i can expect bad service.  I then brought it up to the hostess when paying for my meal, telling him we come during the lunch hour to avoid poor service like what we experienced. He stated that I shouldn't come on dollar sushi night if I expect good service. Why would I come on another night to take a chance on poor service and PAY MORE?!?!"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of rolls. Nice atmosphere too for a C-U restaurant. Service is mostly decent unless its busy then you don't always get full attention. One of the best Sushi places in in C-U."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this a lot! Decent, fast sushi. I liked the more informal environment for price and quick meal that I wanted. Got the sampler and two other rolls to try a bunch of different ones. Will come here again to try some of the others!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service was absolutely unacceptable. Server fumbled tray resulting in two of our guest being drenched I'm alcohol. Accidents happen, but the server was unapologetic. Restaurant had no management staff on site to assist customers with issues. An hour and half dinner easily turned into 2.5hrs. Server quickly moved from unapologetic to completely disrespectful in the way he handled the rest of the guest. As a local it was embarrassing because I raved about the establishment, and because of the issues that faced I honestly don't think I'll be back, nor will I ever recommend my family, friends, or students to dine here."}
{"text":"Dollar sushi Sundays are a must.  Love the Big Roll, Volcano, fried shrimp roll, even the sushi roll with beef!  Not the BEST sushi, probably not even the best sushi in Champaign, but certainly good, and an amazing deal on Dollar Sushi Sundays and Mondays... great chance to sample the different rolls, for $1 per piece of sushi.  The service has always been okay for us.. very quick.  We try to come here each time we make it back to Champaign!"}
{"text":"I ordered Chicago rolls (seared-tuna and/or salmon with cream cheese, crab meat stick, nori komi furikake, and spicy sauce). I went there at 4pm, so the place wasn't that busy. My friend got the food so quickly, but I'd been waiting for around 15 minutes, so I asked the waitress (the one who actually got my order), and it turned out that she served my dish to a table next to mine. She suddenly took the plate from the other table to me and said that they hadn't touched it yet before rushing away. The slices of fish on top of the rolls were unacceptably thin for the price of $16.45 for 8 pieces. The taste was fine, but I think Sakanaya might be a better place for sushi."}
{"text":"Great scaled back version of the downtown Champaign location.  I love that the big rolls are $1 each and every day, I'm jealous that this was not on campus when I was a student.  Despite not having all the glitz of the original, the service was excellent and staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"If I could I would give three and a half stars but I'm gonna bump it to four since they just opened. I think with the lack or marketing it was confusing when the new spot opened but it was the express version. This place has a completely different feel from the one downtown which is fine. I like that it's quick and I don't feel weird eating alone between classes because everyone else is doing the same. Sushi was good. Nothing amazing I only got cooked seafood so I can't say on freshness of the fish. However their set up for cooking is going to lose them money. I ordered three BIG roll pieces and I watched him pull them out from under a heat lamp. Obviously they have to make the whole roll and not waste money but I don't want to see that process.  Not the chefs fault just the layout.  Maybe once it's consistently busy that won't happen as much but definitely takes away from the idea of fresh sushi. But I still ate it and it didn't taste dried out so I can't really complain. It's a clear your own plates place or its implied with the dirty bins out next to the trash which I hate but whatever everyone does it. This is a quick place for sushi and I think the pros out weight the cons. If you want a more sit down experience go downtown."}
{"text":"We had dinner on Monday evening, $1 sushi night. Our entire experience was very nice, worthy of a return trip.  Yet, what separates this dinner from all others was what happened after we finished.  We had finished, started getting ready to leave. William became upset because he couldn't find something he had brought with him.   We got to the car, i went back in to ask if they found something (a toy) at our location to call me and i would return to pick it up.   As i returned to the car, our waiter (Daniel) followed me out and had found the stylus that had been dropped by William.  The food was good, the service with that little extra effort made our dinner excellent."}
{"text":"Kofusion is a fun restaurant.  The service has always been above average, and the $1 sushi is very tasty. I wish the regular dinner menu was a bit more expansive. Also, I wish that they offered the sample sushi platter (that is offered during dollar sushi nights) on their regular menu throughout the week."}
{"text":"I went here recently with a bunch of friends, and I'll definitely be back soon!  The food was great.  I had the angus beef stir fry, and was really exceptional.  The service was very good, and the atmosphere was really nice."}
{"text":"Food - Pretty good.   Buffet - Oddly good.  Small chafing dishes and it's bust so it is fresh.   Decor - like they went to Miami in the early 90's and stripped a low end night club. Service - pretty good for the most part.  I been there a few times now and I have had good , but a few bad too.  Once a girl that I had to point out the wine on the list, a Sauvignon Blanc, and she brought me a red???  Another really bad server just would not leave us alone because it was slow, though I forgave it because he was REALLY hot, like most of their staff.  That should not matter, but I would rather look at a hot guy, then not."}
{"text":"This place is not as good as people make it seem. I'm not into sushi places with all the frills, just gimmie some great sushi and I'm all for the hole in the wall spots as I find them to be more genuine. This place has chewy sushi and all in all I won't ever go back. Save the ambiance and improve your FOOD, Kofusion.   You are better off spending a little more at Sakanaya."}
{"text":"Besides it being chilly inside, for my first time here, I don't like that it's not like the other kofusions on campus. I came with some friends and we had to order like it was fast food at the counter, and there were no waitresses to bring or refill our drinks. But the food is delicious and service was good. I like the darkness and bright blue lights at the other kofusions...it's 4 p.m. and still to bright in here."}
{"text":"Love the high quality of their food. It is all good!!! Very clean. Love the ambiance. Great lunch time buffet."}
{"text":"I used to work here, so I can say from the perspective of the kitchen that the quality of food is quite high.  All the meat is bought from small organic farms that the chef researched.  In the case of the chicken, we used to get it from Mahomet, just down the road.  Everything came in fresh.  If the place was out of chicken, we didn't have chicken.  No running to the grocery store and lowering quality just to keep it on the menu for the night.  I definitely witnessed a great deal of dedication to the food by the head chef, and if anything makes the place expensive, it's that dedication to always serve the finest ingredients.  That being said, I can only apply that to the kitchen that prepared the entrees, or cooked food.  The sushi obviously must travel some distance to get to Champaign, but the quality is the highest that can be expected that many miles from the ocean.  So if your looking for a place that will prepare simple, elegant meals using top ingredients and organic meat, this is your place."}
{"text":"It's pretty good sushi done with a Midwest emphasis, served by mostly nice folks, under some weird mood lighting that thinks it might be hip but mostly makes me think about hitting some acid.  I'm surprised people gripe about the price, since it costs more to eat at several of the burger joints close by. Seafood in the Midwest is absurd to purchase, so I expect it to be a little pricier, but it's fairly comparable. Today, we ordered an app, two bar drinks, three rolls and two desserts and it was $63. Not bad, IMO.   I always wish the menu was more descriptive, especially about what sauces come on which rolls. I about burnt my lip off today.   The service is hit or miss. Some of the staff behaves a little lofty, but maybe that's what they think people expect. Or maybe some people are just assholes.   Anyway...if you're on the fence, go for dollar sushi and give it a try. You can order online, which is sweet. If you call it in, make sure they read it back.   So...four stars for a lack of consistency."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have some very unique sushi but they also have some boring ones. So long as you order right, the sushi is amazing. I recommend the flaming red dragon ( i think that is what it was called). The stir fry is also superb. Service is great also."}
{"text":"KoFusion's campus location was quite a letdown. I've heard many good things about the downtown Champaign KoFusion, but have never made the trek over there, so I had high hopes for this location. However, expectations were not met. This restaurant seems like a place that put too much emphasis on being hip and much less on the actual food. The dollar rolls were good, but too small for a dollar. It does have really nice decor and a cool drink selection."}
{"text":"I always laugh when people tell me that their favorite place for sushi is Ko-fusion. I have been there 4 times and each time, I was quite disappointed in the food. The first time I went there my friends dragged for \"dollar sushi\" night. I thought I was getting robbed more than saving money, the pieces they give you are very small. The only reason why is its a dollar is because you have to eat like 10 pieces to fill up. The second time I went in there, we ordered a few rolls, and they took quite a while, when I looked over at the customers next to us, it looked like what we ordered, turned out it was. The girls were like, \"this is not what we ordered and had sat on there table for 5 mins before the waitress came and brought it to our table,at that point we just ate and left, she didnt even get a tip. The 2 other times were just as bad, I'll save you time and money, and tell you to try the other sushi places in town."}
{"text":"Love the fresh ingredients! Dollar sushi days give you a chance to try different things, good variety. Best sake mojitos EVER!"}
{"text":"\"Good Area Sushi, Great Atmosphere, $1 Sushi Sunday\"  Ko Fusion offers decent sushi for Champaign-Urbana area. Set conveniently downtown Champaign, the restaurant's atmosphere is very modern and chic - almost like a restaurant out of Chicago - and offers fusion entrees outside of their sushi menu. Ko Fusion offers a large bar area and outdoor seating.  $1 Sushi Sunday is their best deal, which allows diners to sample $1 pieces of sushi from their menu."}
{"text":"It's decent, but don't go there expecting it to be like the downtown location.  The dollar sushi was decent--not great, but great sushi is hard to come by on campus.  I also had one of the stir-frys, which I was more satisfied by--the spicy sauce had a nice kick to it and the vegetables were very fresh.  I would go back, but it's dealing with a weird middle ground between budget sushi and upscale \"downtown\" sushi, and I'm not sure that's going to be viable for them long-term."}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent.  Very high marks for the mango coconut roll, it was FANTASTIC (with the added bonus of being one of the more reasonably priced items on the menu).    I would have given 4 stars, but our waitress recommended a specialty roll that wasn't on the menu, she said it was her favorite, so we gave it a try.  It was very spicy, and it was about $4 or $5 more than any other roll on the menu.  It would have been nice if she disclosed both of those facts while recommending it."}
{"text":"the place looks like an A+++ restaurant, but the food is only B grade!!  its pretty decent, but DESTIHL across the street is far better!!    the oysters are just straight up oysters, no sauce or nothing so just fyi...  the entree was duck and it was okay, nothing spectacular...  the sushi, was only mediocre..."}
{"text":"I ordered the Stir Fry option: Spicy, fried tofu, udon noodles- comes with mixed vegetables; I also ordered a Veggie Roll & added: mango, cucumber, carrot, & seaweed. Great location, fast, & love the option to choose the ingredients!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and fair.   You get great 1.00 sushi here!!!    And they have brown rice sushi during the week here, which is great for those of us that eat clean.   Our service was also really great too. We went as a large group on a Sunday and they helped us out and gave us plenty of space."}
{"text":"The service is terrible.   We had a huge group going, but it is summer time on campus, and few people were there. We did our orders in shifts, and I was among the first few. We had a few people arriving late, and their orders were taken maybe 10-20 minutes after mine. After the whole party--except me--got their dishes AND finished them, mine came, with a simple cold indifferent apology. I did go to the waiter to check on my dish, and she just said the dish was in line.   Be prepared for a long wait with indifferent apology."}
{"text":"I've gone on dates where I've spent $80 for two and frequent on sundays where i spend $5 for one. Great vibe, location, decor, experience, etc. The only downfall is the price tag. Of course, Sunday and Mondays provide the $1 sushi deal. The sushi is good, but sometime it has the tendency of being rather small. If it wasn't for the convenient location and decor, Sushi lovers would probably hit up the other spots are the CU that happen to be a little be further from campus.  Overall, cool spot...on Sundays/Mondays."}
{"text":"Good combination, more of a snack place to me.... Not so fulling for the price but good quality"}
{"text":"Diners beware!!!  I have never been to a restaurant that so blatantly tried to up-sell everything!  The rolls are really pretty big but the waitress suggested 2 rolls per person,  The menu doesn't give you a clue as to how large the rolls are so it is really easy to fall for the suggestion.  The waitress gave us a bunch of recommendations. Essentially, the waitress told us that  every roll over $17 is \"REALLY good\".  Some were & some weren't.  Of course, the waitress suggested dessert.  We passed.  The restaurant offers various specials, including an Asian buffet until 1:30 pm on Saturdays.  I would highly recommend finding out what the specials are and planning your visit based on the specials.    The lobster roll WAS really tasty but PASS on the flaming phoenix roll.  If I go again I will order 1 roll at a time & see how that goes.  The place is expensive enough without the wait staff trying to upsell at every turn.  I'm still irritated by the tactics"}
{"text":"Pick up order was quick. Kinda pricey for just tofu, vegetable, and noodle stirfry ($11), but wow, that was the most bland and boring dish possible. I'm really sad that I didn't put any soy sauce in the bag with my order because it didn't even taste like it had any salt added. Just spice and oil. So much for lunch! Dish will be going home with me so I can eat it with some seasoning. Expected much better for such a high price tag."}
{"text":"In terms of sushi quality, they are good. However, their rolls are overly complicated and portions are small. Their prices are too high. You are paying for the raver club scene atmosphere when you go here. The service is annoying in that they are always too busy for you, act like the atmosphere (pompous), and will relentlessly try to upsell you into appetizers and drinks. And good luck getting seated during dollar sushi nights. I much prefer Sushi Kame just around the corner - which has great food, great service, great prices, and a low key atmosphere."}
{"text":"Admittedly I only tried this place once last summer for dollar sushi night. The selection was just too weird for my taste and not well executed (e.g. Chicken fajita sushi) and the one experience was enough to keep me from returning."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting atmosphere inside, but we loved eating on the patio.   We had tasty salmon cakes and good mussels as appetizers. The sake sangria was interesting and refreshing (and a generous portion). The volcano rolls were delicious, and the tiramisu was a fantastic end to the meal.   The server was very pleasant too."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why people come here. Yes, I will admit the decor allows you a temporary escape of living in the midwest, but, that really the only thing going for it. I believe the quality of fish is extremely poor, over priced, and simply, not tasty. I have been there multiple times only to ask myself why?   The only reason why I guess I decided to give it two stars instead of one is the service and drinks. Only saving grace."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but very poor customer service. Each time I go I wait over 25 mins for takeout (even when they're not busy) and whenever I check in on my order it's always \"oh they dropped the ticket they'll make it right now\".  Manager was very dismissive when I was expressing my repeated concerns, and unfortunately I'm unwilling to return."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet which looked and smelled great. It didn't have much vegetarian fare so I opted for a couple rolls and miso soup. The miso soup was excellent, great flavor. I had the BIG Roll and the Coconut & Mango roll. The BIG roll was underwhelming. Basically a larger fried California roll. Which would have been okay had the fried tempura outside not tasted like bad oil that need to be changed. The Coconut & Mango Roll was very interesting and I really enjoyed it. It contained coconut shrimp which was a unique sushi ingredient to me. I would go back again for that roll and soup and call it it a day. My lunch companions buffet comments: The Salmon Miso soup would have been worth the price of the buffet alone! Sweet potato noodles, and the chicken curry were excellent. He thought the quality of all the dishes was great for a buffet and while the selection was smaller it was worth it based on how well each dish was prepared.   In addition the service was very good, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place don't deserve a star. I would give -5star if I can.  You wouldn't call this place restaurant.  They have no basic standard skill as restaurant should have. No customer service, no greeting customers when walked in, no escort service to the table, no beverage serving when seated, and the food is serously worst.   This is place where everything in self service a minute you walk in so if you want to serve yourself and not being served, go ahead but save your money and energy. DONT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"This place has great sushi!  They have great Monday night specials ($1 pieces of sushi, $3 sake) which I love to take advantage of.  I really love the big roll, the beef roll, and the dynamite roll.  Pheonix is an \"off the menu\" roll that you can order which comes out on a plate set on fire.  Mixed drinks are really good there too."}
{"text":"$1 sushi at the Urbana location if you want some cheap americanize sushi. Meaning very little fish and a lot of fillers. Their rolls are too expensive and better off going elsewhere if you want sushi rolls. The sashimi bowl wasn't too bad, fish was fresh and of high quality, but it is quite expensive at $17."}
{"text":"I received a recommendation to eat here from the driver at my hotel. She loved a specific salad and thought I might enjoy the restaurant. I arrived to a beautiful restaurant with a friendly staff. I moved outside, as the night was warm. I ordered wine and asked the server to return so that I could order my appetizer. The restaurant was virtually empty, but she took a very long time. Eventually, I placed my order. I received my dinner before my appetizer. I ordered the seafood cheese springroll. It was not good. There is no other way to say it. It tasted like cream cheese in a spring roll. The crab and pollack was missing in action. I couldnt finish it and the server never asked me how it was.   The entree itself, a stirfry dish with panang curry was delicious. It wasnt the best I've tasted, but it was still very good. Now..with my wine glass empty and half of my entree gone, I waited for the server to order more wine. She never came. After 20 minutes, I got up and asked the hostess for my server. The hostess was going home so couldnt help me. I waited a bit more and then asked again for the waitress. After half an hour, a young lady came out and said, I'm sorry but your server went home.   The manager never came out to explain. No one asked if I needed or wanted anything. She just said, your server went home and gave me a check. I looked at the bill and realized that she had overcharged me. The seafood yuck was on the menu for $8, but she charged me $10. Then, I had to wait for her to call the manager and for him to fix the bill. Still, he did not appear in this very empty restaurant. He called from the back and said I fixed it. He took $5.00 off instead of the overcharge of $2.00. Perhaps this was to placate me. How about, Oh, I'm so sorry that we sent your server home without giving you another server. Oh, you didnt like the seafood springroll, can we get you something else instead. Nothing.   I left the restaurant and determine that I would never go back again. It was definitely below the level of a good restaurant. Below fair as well. I guess this means poor."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for my first ever non sushi meal here. Service was excellent, atmosphere was excellent, food was excellent. I originally ordered the salmon but they were out so I went with the duck. I'm not a foodie but it was a ten to me. Tender flavorful, not greasy.  If you sit at 6pm on a Saturday night you won't need reservations but by 6:30 you will."}
{"text":"Kofusion is definitely a good spot for a \"nicer\" dinner in Champaign. I'd been here a long time ago (like a year and a half ago) right after the place opened, and it was kind of dead and empty. But I went again a couple of nights ago, and the place was fairly crowded and happening. I was by myself so I sat at the bar, where the bartender took very good care of me.  First a few words about the place: it's fairly large, with two different seating areas separated by the bar area, and they obviously spent the bucks on the decor. It's fairly modern, with a black and dark blue color scheme, a (fairly) beautiful bar, etc... You somehow can't help thinking that maybe they tried a little too hard to look sophisticated, but nonetheless it makes for a fairly good ambiance.  The food is a mix of Asian (mostly Japanese) and new American. I'm usually weary of fusion... but it wasn't bad at all. The first time I was here, I ordered the chirashi, which wasn't the best I've had in my life but was surprisingly decent considering the location (as far from any ocean as you can be in the country...). This time, I started with a seaweed salad (tasty), followed by the whole trout, which came with sauteed mushrooms and spinach... The trout was pretty good, and the veggies delicious. I finished with the black sesame ice-cream: for $4, I expected a tiny little scoop, but I was served a heaping bowl of ice-cream with a strawberry and a wafer... just great.  Not to forget their drinks: they have a pretty large selection of wine and sake, as well as a full bar. I had one of their specialty cocktails (the ko-tini: sake, absolut, and peach schnapps in a martini glass... pretty good), and another mixed drink. I was especially shocked to see how inexpensive they were, being used to NY prices.  Based on the food only, I would have given this place 3-1/2 to 4 stars, but the service was top notch. The bartender was extremely friendly and efficient, and treated me very well... I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I have not tried the regular menu but the lunch buffet was very impressive! I wish there were more than just California rolls as far as sushi goes but all the other food was amazing. The donuts are spectacular and the customer service was awesome too."}
{"text":"I loved the vibe of this place and our server was excellent, but the prices are outrageous. It's ludicrous for a place to charge $8 for a California roll and $10 for a spicy tuna. The food was above average sushi, but come on! I get that it may be more expensive to get fresh fish to Campaign than Chicago, but I didn't expect to be giving my arm and my leg to pay for a specialty roll.  I can see why the place is a huge draw when they have specials, but I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot poll if you are paying full price."}
{"text":"Went there during mom's weekend at UIUC on a beautiful Saturday night and the place was packed. We ordered the Sushi combo A with 7 pcs of nigiri and a California roll, for $25.95. Miso soup is an extra $3.00. The waitress forgot the wasabi. The sushi rice was hard, cold and tasteless, the toppings,so-so. If you want mediocre sushi in a trendy setting with a bunch of good looking people, this is the place. Otherwise go down the street to Sushi Kame, where they take the time and care to prepare sushi the right way without having to fork out an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for a limited menu (hence the one star off - but it would be a half if I could) - but the staff is awesome (and super hilarious) and service has always been fast and great.  Sushi is fresh and super tasty, and the stir fry, edamame & miso are excellent. Great choice for lunch on campus - highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hate to say it......this just wasn't a good sushi experience. I've had sushi in different places all over the US, and this was genuinely one of the most unduly pricey yet unremarkable meals.   Kofusion is mostly about being downtown and seeing/being seen-- it's the only \"little bit of LA\" that we have, and is a good place to go for sushi & drinks before clubbing. Then the problem presents its self- where to go clubbing? lOl  I visited Kofusion with two guests, with the intention of \"introducing them to sushi\"- and was really disappointed, even a little embarrassed. I feel like there are chains on the west coast like Kabuki which offer far more exciting food, dramatically bigger portions, and with less contrived pretentiousness."}
{"text":"Got sushi for the first time here when I was visiting my girlfriend at U of I and it was dollar sushi day so we got so much. It was the best sushi ever I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We have gone on dollar sushi night and the food and service is on point. The sushi is awesome although I'm no connoisseur. I went here a few times for lunch buffet and that too was good."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, really good bold and fresh flavors. I had the Chicago roll and it was awesome. They were also very generous with the sauce. Although as to be expected, it was quite pricey, and they did forget to serve the ginger. Nevertheless it was a good meal and i will be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap! My favorite was the coconut shrimp crunchy one. I think I had a spider roll too. The Phoenix roll was amazing with so many layers of flavor and texture. This place kindled my love for sushi. The decor was super cool inside too."}
{"text":"Honestly, I rarely frequented this place when it wasn't a Sunday or Monday Night ($1 sushi night), maybe once or twice when I had a craving.  But I'm smart enough to go on the $1 nights so I don't feel bad (was then a college student).  On regular nights - it can be seen as pricey. On $1 night, it is awesome.   I love the big roll. If you are a first time Sushi eater, try that one first, it is like a flavor party in your mouth. Anything with crab is easy peasy for a first timer. It was my first one.  I slowly ventured into others and now I can eat almost anything and usually love them all. Most of their $1 sushi is delicious. If you are vegetarian, don't run away, their veggie futo roll/vegetarian maki is gross, but get the one you can custom make and have them tempura fry it, they might give u some crap about not being able to tempura fry it but they can and it will be yummy, I guarantee it!  They also have tiramisu, which is great because I love it. And a bunch of other fusion dishes for the non-sushi eaters.   I don't know why people complain about the decor, despite the glass bricks, it has a pretty cool contemporary/marina style...which kind of makes sense, duh."}
{"text":"Great food, relatively quick service, but I had an experience with an unprofessional waitress. Otherwise, calm restaurant with relaxing vibes. Abouy average prices for sushi. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Ehh...they bring you large ceramic plates with a little bit of food in the center. They call it \"New Age\" cuisine (aka money-saving cuisine).  Service was not so great."}
{"text":"Tried it out on dollar sushi sunday.   Food (3/5) Overall the food was meh. Very heavy on sauce and some of the pieces were downright tiny. Granted they were $1 a piece. Pretty bad unagi - which I wouldn't think is that hard to mess up. Some of the rolls were tasty, but I could barely taste anything besides rice and sauce.   Service (-10/5) Our waiter was easily the worst I've ever had. He was probably hungover - he mumbled the entire time and repeatedly spilled water. The rest of the staff seemed aloof and apathetic as well.    Ambiance (2/5) This is one ugly restaurant. It seemed clean enough, but the tacky fish tanks and lights did not foster any trust that I would be getting quality food.  Overall (2/5) Maybe they had an off day. Maybe they slack on sundays. $1 sushi is the only redeeming quality."}
{"text":"Sadly to say, I was eager to taste the sample that were being offered at the Blues and Brews festival this year.(2014)  I was highly disappointed when everyone before me was getting large plates for the 7 dollars or tickets. When I paid she gave me two of the smallest pieces of meat she had. I shook my head and politely declined and got a refund.   Sad that she was blatantly discriminatory. Oh well no Kofusion for me... EVER!"}
{"text":"OK. I have been to KoFusion many times, but it had been almost a year between my visit last night and the time before that... I basically gave up on them a year ago, and last night proved me right because of the two siple but way too important Cons... so here is my list of Pros and Cons... decide for yourselves! Pros: Downtown, cool atmosphere, always busy Great decor, very clean Friendly staff and quick service Surprisingly fresh sushi, and excellent entree dishes Cons: TOTALLY, horribly overpriced (especially compared to Kamakura) Lots of the sushi rolls (with the exception of the extremely simple rolls)are over-the-top and too complicated or too fried...they don't seem Asian at all  Hmph."}
{"text":"What a trendy little spot this place is! I am a huge fan of fusion restaurants, so that alone made me excited about this place. However, I think after seeing some of the dishes our table got, I should have gone the japanese route and gotten some sushi or sashimi!  I did get their scallops in a panany curry sauce that was pretty good. And it had avocado in it as well which I always appreciate. Not quite enough vegetables though for my liking, but the flavor overall was good and it taught me that I need to work on my chopstick skills a little more too!   Speaking of chopsticks, our dinner group was all White and then one biracial Asian/White man and he was the only one to automatically be given chopsticks and the rest of us got asked about whether we wanted a western or eastern eating utensil! I could believe it, especially as a race researcher myself. Pretty funny stuff. What if that one biracial Asian guy didn't know how to use chopsticks?? That would have been all kinds of awkward.   But the drinks were made strong here, the service was good, and the ambiance is pretty fun too. You definitely feel like you went out to dinner here!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I went with a group from work and pretty sure we ordered everything off the menu. All was great but if I had to pick a favorite it would be the coconut mango or Phoenix rolls. Great service - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"When to dinner with a friend. Food was OK. The atmosphere: earnest trendiness. Learned afterwards that the waiter had charged my credit card twice for the meal. Not ideal. So, I called and called... and called. Over the course of three days, the manager was either not in or not able to help. So, if you go, make sure you're correctly charged. Don't expect the restaurant to be concerned otherwise."}
{"text":"Went for my favorite beef stir fry and the service was awful, nice folks but with taste of champaign going the staff broke down, they had clearly not prepared and the toc has been an annual event for nearly two decades! Good food priced accordingly, this is the second time the service was below par"}
{"text":"In my view, in the US there are generally three types of Sushi places.  The very small, packed place that has the run of the mill sushi, the convert belt sushi, or the fancy schmancy type with renamed sushi rolls and a few not so common.     In my view Kofusion is, at least this location is the fancy schmancy type and the prices to go with it.   Nonetheless they have some unique rolls and have more than just sushi.    So if you have friends who are adverse to raw seafood, they'll be able to find items such as hibachi chicken or beef, along with rice or noodle dishes.     The service was, just okay.  For as few people there were at the time we visited, I felt the service could have been far better.  My suspicion is the kid was nursing a hangover, but he was friendly and he did get our order right.     As with most sushi places, when the two platters of sushi rolls came to the table they presented well and certainly there was pride in the work.   The rolls were nice and tight and didn't fall apart from plate to mouth.  The fish, especially the salmon was very fresh and I liked the special sauce used on the spicy tuna.      I would certainly come back here again, although if you've not been to the Mongolian place just up the road, I would suggest giving that a try too.  Both places are excellent.    One other point.  If you happen to be over by the collage, there is a small Kofusion place by the Music hall.  I've not been there myself, but just thought I'd mention it so you didn't trek through congested roads."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the entire world!  Get Chicago and Fusion and wash them down with a Zentini and try the salmon and the duck.  Then finish off with killer desserts.  Great staff and service.  I love, love, love this place.  Worth the drive from out of town.  Been going since 2002 or 2004."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely spectacular. I love the decor and the prices are reasonable. The only reason I leave off one star is because some of the waitresses aren't spectacular. I also get very annoyed with picking up food. The hostess will tell me 15 minutes and it will take longer than 30. I even leave late expecting the long wait and will still have to sit around for a few minutes for it. Every once in a while they forget the miso soup too."}
{"text":"I debated, 3 or 4 stars, but went with 3 for now until I try it again. The lunch buffet was fairly interesting and a great way to try various foods, including the sushi. Get there early for the buffet as it got crowded at noon. I got there quite early and was a disappointed in the temperature of the food; it already seemed to be getting cold."}
{"text":"Kofusion has great atmosphere and is a very cool looking restaurant.  We were able to get a seat right away on a busy Saturday night which was terrific.  They were going to sit us at a table but my brother requested a booth instead and they were happy to oblige our request.  At recommendation of our waiter me and my brother both got their sangria.  Sangria was strong and very good.  We ordered their seafood/cheese rolls as an appetizer.  The rolls were perfectly crispy, with a nice amount of filling, with a nice sweet sauce to dip it in.  We ordered several rolls (the flaming phoenix, firecracker, fusion, and the Philadelphia roll).  I gotta give top marks to the originality and presentation of the flame phoenix.  The sushi was acceptable but is not going to blow anyone away whose had good sushi.  The rice was a little too chewy and the firecracker was very flimsy with its thinly sliced pieces of jalapeño.  I liked Kofusion and would definitely go back.  But its very expensive and the sushi is only ok.  When we decided we needed another roll we had to ask another waiter to track down our waitress (who had gotten busy with her other tables). Other than that minor flaw, I thought the service was very good."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing and the service exceptional. Our waitress Elaine was the epitome of what customer service in a dining establishment should be like. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I used to think this place was expensive. A few plaecs serve sushi in Champaign, Ko Fusion is probably ranked right in the middle. I've only eaten it on dollar sushi nights, which, now that I think about it, is a spectacular bargain.  For a Champaign restaurant, Kofusion has a very modern look; frosted glass, colored lights, and random decorations add to the very un-Champaign look and feel, which is refreshing at times.  I've also been told that they hold salsa nights here, though I haven't experienced it. Overall, great place on those dollar sushi nights. Can't say much for the rest."}
{"text":"Monday rolls around I down two rounds of round rolls  Drop twenty and leave  (I have ONLY been here for one dolla' sushi night on Mondays.  For under $20, you can have a VERY filling sushi meal at Kofusion.  This isn't the best place in town for 'authentic' sushi, but they certainly do have some fun creations.  If you've never been here, Monday is an excellent time to try the place out without breaking the bank.  Just consider getting threre early... it tends to get busy as the night goes on!  It's a fun place with an interesting atmosphere and cheap sushi.  You can't go wrong. Recommended.)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Best sushi in town! I'm not a big fish eater but they make such unique sushi...hot and cold.. That has broadened my taste buds! Also love their lunch buffets! It is affordable and you can taste something else rather than just the sushi!"}
{"text":"Had a really great meal here last night. Service was top notch and food was exciting."}
{"text":"I planned my bachelorette party in Champaign 6/2 and wanted to include one of my favorite restaurants from when I lived in the area. We made a 7pm reservation and my \"bride tribe\" and I arrived in a timely fashion. We were seated at two folding tables, outside (as requested). We all ordered water, (crazy bunch, eh?) And were soon ready to order. This is where it really got fun. There was a 5 minute conversation with the server about distaste for seaweed in sushi and options for omitting that. Hooray for soy! Time passes and sushi apps come out. With seaweed. And we are missing the soup. Server seems unphased by us asking if the sushi had seaweed and equally unapologetic. The soup arrives. The entrees begin making their appearance  (1 fried sushi roll, 1 walnut salad, several stir fry, and one steak entree were ordered). It took 2 trips, not a problem. But this is where we really began losing patience. The steak..... it was MIA. Mind, you this is the same person whose soup was overlooked. We waited 20 minutes then kindly asked server how much longer. Her reply? \"They are getting it out of the oven\" (the oven?!) So now it's past 8:30, the rest of my party is packing to go boxes and the steak makes it's appearance about 8:45. We air our frustrations  (civily) about the numerous complications and were greeted with whatnot can best describe as an oblivious waitress. We eventually had to get a manager involved (food was good for the rest of us and she was kind enough to give steak entree discount). Finally, it's nearly 9:45pm, again we try to engage w waitress telling her (nicely) that her forgetfulness cost us quite a bit of time as we had plans. Her clever response to this one was \"next time give us a schedule and we can try to work around it\". That was the point of the reservation! Needless to say, it put a bit of a damper for my night. Maybe this server needs a bit more training?"}
{"text":"I've been to Kofusion several times for dinner and have found their sushi and dinner entrees to be delicious. If it wasn't so pricy I would definitely eat here more often. Dollar sushi nights (Sunday and Monday) are a nice opportunity to check out different rolls. However, don't be fooled by the $1... after a couple glasses of wine/beer and an edamame appetizer with your dollar sushi you can still expect your bill to be at least $25-30 per person- but it's worth it! The only catch with dollar sushi nights is that the service is usually very slow.  The lunch buffet was really disappointing and in my opinion overpriced. We arrived at noon and much of the food on the buffet seemed as if it had been sitting in the warmer- tough/dry chicken, over cooked edamame, warm sushi.... Skip it and order from the menu."}
{"text":"Funky atmo, if a bit 80's, and great food expertly presented and served."}
{"text":"Well, where to start?  The owner of this place is rude to guests and employees. She wanders around forever, blankly looking at the ceiling (or so it seems). I hate to be so harsh, but I applied for a job there. The woman asked me 2-4 questions and decided to hire me. Then, the owner came in the next morning and decided it wasn't going to work out. They wasted four hours of my time and showed me how not local and not fresh the food is. Really, they aren't unlike many other restaurants now a days. With so many people to feed and pressure to make money, there isn't much choice.   I was excited to go to a \"hip\" place and work with sushi, something I'd never done before. But the other employees were hipster-ish and snobby.   I go back there because the sushi is enjoyable and my boyfriend likes it. Last time we went (6-6-10) it took us almost 30 minutes just to get our check, because the owner didn't schedule enough people. I'm a waitress; I understand this issue. Naturally, we still tipped our waitress. However, when people come into town, there are many many restaurants I would recommend before KoFusion."}
{"text":"Kofusion tries a bit too hard to be hip and edgy.  As I am from Los Angeles, where pretentious restaurants are about as ubiquitous as corn is here, it takes more than mood lighting, pseudo-orientalist hipness, and cheap sushi specials to impress.  That said, Kofusion's not *that* bad.  It's decent, for what you get.  The sushi is adequate, the drinks are on point, and the servers are friendly.  Not a bad way to spend a Friday night with friends.  Just don't think you're a) being \"authentic\" or (b) truly hip and classy.  Just enjoy for what it is, a decent midrange sushi place in the midst of Chambana."}
{"text":"Kofusion gets a massive amount of hype around Champaign. Probably because it's the only nice / higher-end sushi place. Kofusion does have other entree dishes besides sushi as well, but you're really going for the sushi.  Which, I have to say, very good. The rolls are definitely ample. 2 Rolls was sufficient for 2 people for dinner.  We had the red dragon roll and the dragon roll. Both had good amounts of fish and eel. The red dragon was especially great with the sriracha on top and the additional fish in the roll. Loved the flavor, didn't even use wasabi/soy for the red dragon half the time. Also, both rolls came on plates with a fair amount of extra eel sauce. So many places cut back on the eel sauce for no real reason, but it's fantastic and I loved wiping up the extra sauce.  Overall, I'd be willing to go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant definately looks elegant and is impressive. It is clear why it was voted best date place in champaign.  The menu is interesting, expensive, and not kid friendly, though that appears intentional, since they want big checks, not big families.Veggie option on the menue I had was tofu veggie stirbfry, but when it came, it had zero tofu. strange given the dish was called tofu vegetable stirfry. The waiter never checked in on us after our food arrived until we were finished. He showed me an updated menu in which there was no tofu in the stir fry, too bad I had an old menu - he didn't appologize, just said that he will make sure to remove the old menus from the stack. thanks... My daughter liked the dumplings and california roll. the edamame are served with sesame oil, which is a nice touch.  The waiter refilled my daughter's lemonade with ice water - thanks for that, too....  My son objected when he tried to fill his sprite with water . My son and wife liked the steak. Dessert was good according to my kids though they didn't finish it, so it couldn't have been that good. I've not seen them fail to finish chocolate cake before. In all, it's over priced, decent food with not so great service, but excellent ambiance.  Great for impressing your date, but not necessarily great food or service."}
{"text":"The ownership group is quite simply the most idiotic group I've ever dealt with. Please don't try to make a reservation, much less come here since they are idiotic. I hate idiots, don't you? If you do, don't come here!"}
{"text":"always my favorite place to go with my boyfriend when we are in champaign. their signature rolls are great! not many options for vegetarians though."}
{"text":"Ok, there's no denying how much we all love the Big Roll. It's why we all eat here. When I worked at Aroma I would get dollar sushi to go every Sunday. And any aroma employee from 2010-2011 will attest that my order was wrong EVERY time. When I say \"every\" I sincerely mean every single time. There was once that I had the best service of my life, but that was about 4 years ago. Recently I was home and went on a Sunday afternoon. Our waitress was so bad. After we had been seated for 15 min my buddy asked the host if anyone was going to wait on us. A girl came over and flatly took our drink order. After we bagan eating my same buddy had to flag the girl down every time we needed our drinks refilled. Maybe she was having a really bad day in her personal life....because she was not interested in being a waitress whatsoever. The food was good tho. Lol.  And while we got shitty service it prompted us to all swap horror stories we've heard about the owner. Seems everyone in town knows someone who worked here for like a day...Or was hired at an interview and never contacted again.   And is the owner un aware that the cheap plastic crap in the fish tanks looks like crystal dildos? Everyone I've taken here comments in the penises in the fish tanks.  God damn it.....I'll be back....you'll be back......we just love that Big Roll for $1!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed dining here.  The food is generally very good, maybe a little expensive, and I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying it was $1 sushi day. And let me also say that the sushi was good. Very good even. The nigiri we ordered was great as well. But the service? The service was horrible. 20 min wait for water, 40 min wait for meal, 30 min more for the second round of sushi, and a whopping 90 min waiting for them to sort out our checks. I talked to the manager. \"10 more min and you'll be out of here, I promise.\" They still had our checks missed up. A 20% discount and free desserts later, I still don't know if I'm going to be back. Too bad. I really liked the meal."}
{"text":"Never, ever again.  This place is awful. Overpriced, bad food, and to top it off? TERRIBLE service.   My friend ordered some type of roll, and she asked they do something different to it. Something minor. So, take a wild guess how many times it came out? Not once, not twice, not even three times...on the FOURTH try it was correct. And every time, the waitress getting increasingly ruder. Finally, before the last time, I asked to have the owner come out, which she did and was somewhat apologetic, but still acted like it was no big deal!  I ordered a scallop curry dish. It was strange to say the least, and they cut the scallops in half crosswise! Bizarre, other than they were trying to make it look like my overpriced tiny \"sea\" scallops were worth it. They were the smallest sea scallops I've ever seen. I am from New England, but I am not expecting the same seafood in Illinois, but COME ON! You aren't fooling anyone.   I am amazed anyone really thinks this is a 5 star place.   It was the worst restaurant experience second only to the time I ate at Miko's...that was worse."}
{"text":"I love the dollar sushi here! I really wish they had more options, however the big, coconut, and creamy rolls are outstanding. If you wanna go off the $1 menu, try the white dragon! The soy sauce isn't overly salty which I appreciate. I've always had good service, and we call to pick up orders all the time! Highly recommend for sushi."}
{"text":"KoFusion is easily the best sushi in Champaign-Urbana.  They have a wide selection of Japanese food.  Also, on Sunday and Monday, they offer 10 different rolls for $1 each.  It's absolutely glorious.  The atmosphere is also one of the best in Champaign-Urbana.  With sushi this good, I would be satisfied with a hole-in-the-wall location.  However, KoFusion is classy!  There are tanks of fish, complicated ambient lighting, waterfalls, and many other clever design elements.   HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"I would give this place 2.5 stars. There was nothing really terrible about kofusion but there wasn't anything that great about it either! Atmosphere- fine. A little sparkly for my taste but whatever. It was busy, otherwise sitting outside on the patio would have been much nicer. Service- I know it was busy but the service was a mess. The food came out really fast but none of us had chopsticks, or soy sauce, or ginger, or wasabi, and they were about to just leave us! Not to mention trying to get a drink! Food- pretty bland and mushy with a couple good standouts on my sampler plate. I swear, one of the bad ones must have been the bologna of the sea because it looked/tasted like a hunk of spam stuffed into a roll form topped with some sauce. I spit that one out.  There were a couple good pieces that after I try every other sushi restaurant in C-U I might come back for."}
{"text":"Very good food! Could use more of a selection of traditional meats like steak."}
{"text":"Good service, and surprisingly good seafood for CU. The cocktails are also very good. Try the sake sangria."}
{"text":"I would not recommend going to this place any other nights/days then Sunday & Monday which is when most of their sushi/maki rolls are only $1 each! The food here is amazing! I would highly recommend the big roll and the volcano, my two favorites. I could probably live off of it. Their miso soup is excellent, and for desert try the red bean ice cream, sounds strange, but its delicious! They also have a great selection of martinis to pick from. The service is always iffy, but the last couple times we have lucked out with good servers. But either way you can usually find me here on a Sunday or Monday getting my fill of yummy yummy sushi!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat sushi. They also have excellent drinks (martinis are the best). The house rolls are prepared here and are absolutely delectable. You will not be disappointed. Every time I am in town i make sure to stop in and have a meal."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for the $1 sushi as well as the lunch buffet.  For the $1 sushi, the Big Roll is a must. It's convenient that if you order and are still hungry, you can order some more- even if it's only a couple pieces. It's a great way to test out some of their menu options without breaking your bank.  The lunch buffet is outstanding- they always offer 3 types of sushi in addition to edamame, spring/egg rolls, rice, and chicken & beef dishes. It's hard to pick what to put on your plate.  The specialty cocktails are pretty good too, if a little pricey.  Overall, if you get a deal it's worth it, but I've definitely had better sushi."}
{"text":"Sadly, I discovered Kofusion only a couple months before I graduated but once I discovered the place, I quickly became a regular!   Firstly, people should recognize the restaurant for what it is: Korean fushion food. Thus, there's a wide variety of sushi, my personal favorite: hwe dup bap (like sashimi salad) and a smaller selection of hot (but still great--scallops anyone?) entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much.   If you need a quick sushi fix, dollar sushi Sundays (1 roll = $1) will definitely satisfy your cravings. There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll (read: little to no raw fish). At first I was really disappointed by this, but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough (Big Roll! Coconut Roll!) that I didn't mind at all and eat about $15-$20 worth of sushi anyway. Yes, I am a sushi whore.   If you really want good sushi (with more raw fish or more interesting combinations), Kofusion is still the place to go. Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow-type rolls and more. It's about $1-$2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I've never felt like my rolls weren't worth the cost.   Finally, Kristina is my favorite waitress. Maybe she remembered me for my order (hwe dup bap--seriously, try it if you love raw fish, it is divine) or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well, but after just a few weeks of going weekly, a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly. As a sushi lover, it doesn't really get any better than this.   I'm not going to lie, Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi, I don't find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls. One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll (i.e. Big Roll--that's the one I had) wrapped in soy/rice paper. For those that don't like sushi because of the seaweed, this is a great alternative. For those that still love sushi, try it anyway--it's a great substitution that's worth it to get on its own once in awhile.   I will forever miss Kofusion now that I'm not in the area so please, go get the hwe dup bap, Big Roll, Coconut Roll, or even the thai curry for me please!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after packing up my sibling for the summer.   Gotta say: OOSHI! I decided with the lunch buffet.  Fantastic buffet.  It isn't your typical stereotypical Chinese buffet that you would assume it would be. The highlight was hands down their crispy spicy sweet and tangy chicken.  The perfect crisp and tender chicken inside.  And their fried rice was awesome.  They had these deep fried dough balls filled with red bean.  So good.  Completely satisfied and was ready for our 3 hour ride back home.  Will come again when I drop my sibling back for the next school year."}
{"text":"I've only ever had sushi at Kofusion, so that's what I'll base my review.   As such, I've definitely had better sushi elswhere, but I think this place does have the best sushi in the area. As compared with others, Kofusion has a decent medium-sized selection of rolls. In addition, one dollar sushi definitely is enticing and worth your money. But if you don't go during one dollar sushi hours, it gets a bit pricey, as it should.   I do believe that Kofusion's ambiance is interesting. It's a darker place, with glimmers of neon lights, kind of like a classy club."}
{"text":"I had a very strange experience here.   The service was HORRIBLE. We would have 3/4 of our drink left and the waitress would come with a new cup and switch out the almost full one for a new one. It was super wasteful and ANNOYING because this would happen every couple minutes.   Additionally, she brought our food out at completely different times- like 20 minutes apart even though we requested all the sushi to come at the same time. We were very annoyed by this and expressed our annoyance but only received an explanation and no apology.   The sushi isn't great either. Go to Sakanaya or somewhere else!"}
{"text":"They campus-ified the champaign kofusion.  There is a build your own stir fry, a 6 piece $ sushi sampler, build your own sushi and 3-4 sushi rolls.   The restaurant is very casual - you go to the counter to order, get a number for your table and they will bring the food out to you.  Speaking of casual the music is very weird - distractingly so.  Honestly, it is too expensive for what it is.  I had the tempura ($10) and it was more deep fried than tempura.  The $ sushi sampler was okay, but will get worn very fast (a little like the champaign $ sushi that gets boring after a while) and the sushi roll was more mayo than fish for $14.  All in all not worth the time or price."}
{"text":"Just got into town from Chicago. Been eating sushi since the '80's in California and I swear to you that this is some of the best sushi I've ever had in my LIFE! Had four different rolls: Solomon, Firecracker, Phoenix, Lobster Tail Roll and Blue crab cakes appetizer. Drinks were good and strong too. Great service. Worth the hour and a half drive!!!"}
{"text":"We had my daughter's wedding reception dinner here. It was perfect! The chef, Nigel was very accomodating and the appetizers and meals brought raves from our guests. The staff was exteremely helpful with arranging the room to meet our needs. Great place for a special event. We have also enjoyed the buffet when my family stopped by for lunch."}
{"text":"Outstanding as always. Our waiter, Patrick, was polite and attentive. Always answered with \"You're welcome\", not \"no problem \".  We had 2 of the samplers and the pot stickers. The wait time was very short. Overall a great lunch, which is what I've come to expect from Kofusion!"}
{"text":"Despite looking like the children's exhibits at the Shedd Aquarium, KoFusion has some respectable food. The main reason is that they seem really good at sourcing the best ingredients. Everything on the menu seems to have a pedigree: Immerwald Farms Pork, wild line-caught fish, and Wagyu beef are typical menu items.  Dinner can get quite pricey, but the service is good and the food is delicious. I can't say it's as creative as other establishments in town, but it's done well. I also love that they have meats like wild boar on the menu.   The exception is Sunday and Monday, which is $1 sushi night. The sushi isn't the greatest, but it's decent enough and I'll merrily eat it despite the fact that you aren't supposed to eat seafood on those days because they are probably leftovers. Oh well.   Lunch is far more affordable, especially on Mondays when they have $1 Sushi. I think the Bento Box, which has quite a lot of food, is a good deal. Recently it's had salmon cake, California rolls, Wagyu beef/organic chicken, rice, vegetables, and a salad, but the contents vary. I think I could make two meals out of it and they do allow takeout, but usually I devour it pretty quickly because it's so good.  Many people think the interior here is suave, but if you look at it long enough it just looks tacky."}
{"text":"Omg amazing! Ambience was awesome. Server was super awesome. Best sushi I've had and the drinks were great. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Always good quality. They keep their wait staff and it is professional. Options are wonderful I have no problem taking non sushi eaters. Take out is well policed ensuring the right order."}
{"text":"This place is the pits!!!  Just left and I literally feel sick to my stomach.  The sushi is a joke.  The raw fish is tasteless and rubbery.  Isn't the fish supposed to be fresh???  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I enjoy their dollar menu and it was nice to get the Sampler so I could try one of each.  The sushi is pretty good, not the best in town, but they do interesting flavor and texture combinations.  For example, the Poppers have a crunchy outside and cream cheese inside.    The biggest downside is my plate didn't come with any ginger, as that would've helped me enjoy the Sampler platter more.  The ambiance is trendy and cool.  I also like that they advertise the Hooked app, which reminded me to get a $2 discount (always nice to save a little money).  They have interesting art and chill music.  Kofusion is a solid place to enjoy some sushi!"}
{"text":"The service is the absolute worst. Time after time I ask myself why I keep coming here. The sushi is sub par at best and the overall ambiance is something in between a 80's strip club and a skating rink. I'll pass except when my friends drag me."}
{"text":"First time I came here I LOVED IT. I don't know why, but the flavors of the sushi was amazing. It had so much flavor, but just enough where it wasn't overwhelming. I had the Flaming phoenix roll and something with mushroom in it. For some reason, the second time I came and ordered the same thing it didn't taste as good. I don't know why, but the food tasted from eh to just okay. It definitely was not worth the price the second time for the food quality. This used to be my favorite sushi place, but since the second time I went my thoughts have changed. It's a shame. ): Very beautiful interior design though, but lighting is dark (not really good for taking photos)."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to grab a quick bite! The dollar sushis are a great option! Specially the big roll and creamy shrimp are the best of the lot..you may also want to try shrimp and vegetable tempura as side.."}
{"text":"The sampler menus on Sunday is a great way to amaze your taste buds with variety of sushi..the creamy shrimp is the best but the big roll follows closely behind..try the coconut shrimp with fresh mango if you like something different..the ambience is classy and they also feature a great wine list. We tried the Chilean Sauvignon Blanc!"}
{"text":"Excellent every time!!!  The egg roll vegetable appetizer was incredible. Can't ever go wrong w the big roll. The other two rolls (unfortunately) i cannot remember now were excellent. $1 sushi is always a big favorite but this was a Wednesday night and it was affordable for two."}
{"text":"Kofusion is an interesting name for a restaurant, and they have, I was told, the best sushi in the Champaign/Urbana area.  But when you've had sushi in diverse places, you really only know what's bad.  Thankfully, this wasn't.   I had the Trio roll and it was very good. My date had the fried soft shell crab roll and the portion was huge. Typically I don't eat crab, but I helped her finish what was left and it wasn't too bad, and she said it was excellent.  We shared Edamame too...I mean, who could mess up Edamame?  Good stuff.  We topped it off with a nice Italian (I think) Pinot for her, and I had a Bartenura Moscato. Again, goodness!  Kofusion is the best in the area they say. I can see why they say."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a lot because I enjoy the sushi, but most of the time i've received food I just get it to go. The service is truly not the best and it's disappointing. One time I waited 25 minutes before even getting greated and another 2-3 minutes after the other 3 in my party arrived. The last time in town I went and sat at the bar yet time passed and nobody was there. I flagged down the host to see if they even had a bartender on staff and they grabbed one girl who got me started, some other guy showed up and said he entered my food, then some other guy finished as I was looking around for \"bartender: #2\" to get my check. Literally (sort of literally), the only good thing from here is the food."}
{"text":"I took my significant other here and we both enjoyed the place. I very much enjoyed the food as well as the general feel and look of the place. I will say that it  can get pricey, but for the location and the look of the place I think it is reasonable."}
{"text":"It sort of pains me to not give Kofusion a higher rating because their sushi is really, really good. It's probably some of the best in town, though some of their true standouts also happen to be the most expensive. If I were grading it on it's sushi only I would give it four stars easily. The place has a nice atmosphere and is certainly more thought out than your typical CU restaurant. Is it trying too hard? Maybe, but let's be honest any attempt at trying could be perceived as \"trying to hard\" here because most places don't make any effort at all.  So... shame about the food. I've only tried to eat from their non-sushi menu twice and have been disappointed each time. They're main dishes are over-priced and lack flavor. I will say their seafood had a nice, fresh taste but they don't really do anything with it. I'd recommend getting some friends, ordering a couple baskets of edamame, some drinks and many different kinds of sushi. My favorite is definitely the Lava Roll."}
{"text":"I would not come here again. I ordered the large sashimi platter, and I received 16 super small pieces. I would compare each sashimi to the size of my pinky finger, and my pinky finger is still larger than these pieces. The quality is very low as well; I understand that most sushi places freeze their fish and then thaw it completely before serving it to their customers, but the centers of the sashimi were still frozen. My family has been in the sushi business for over 20 years; and this place brings shame to the sushi business community. (See my pictures as reference) I also ordered the dragon roll. Other sushi places have a tempura middle and the unagi and avocado layered on top, but kofusion serves unagi in the middle and avocado on top. I am just flabbergasted. I will not come back."}
{"text":"I really love Ko Fusion, but first let me explain why I have an issue with how people rate this restaurant.  They are rating it based on Dollar Sushi Night!  Dollar sushi is a special discount night, and as such will be a different dining experience then typical dining hours.  Its not an \"off\" night its just a different dining experience than a Saturday, and yes I'm sure the servers are more frazzled on these busier nights.  Also, people who rate on just the sushi alone need to realize that this is only a portion of the menu.  I love the sushi here, but I also love the creations of chef Nigel.  I have been here dozens of times in my undergrad years and it was always memorable.  The owner might have high standards in her servers, but that's because she expects high standards in everything in her restaurants.  The bathrooms are immaculate!  The food is incredible!  The drinks are amazing and inventive!  Really, this place has such a warm spot in my heart.  For the middle of Illinois, it doesn't get more creative and amazing than this.  Love Ko Fusion!"}
{"text":"Okay, I know it isn't close to STL, but if you're ever in the Champaign- Urbana area you must check this place out. First of all, they only serve organic meats and wild-caught seafood. Second of all, the menu is amazing- so many choices! Small plates, sushi, entrees, great appetizers, wine list, etc. We started with edamame and a dragon roll, I had a vegetable stir-fry (b/c I was feeling kind of basic) and they had wild boar on special that was delicious and not gamey at all (I had to try a bite of a friends'). The open floor plan, changing lights and fish tanks make this place a fun place to sit and have a meal, too. Our waiter was one of the nicest guys I've talked to in a long time, and he was quick with a refill or a table clear. Also, this place serves a delicious mojito made with sake instead of rum. Best drink ever!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Kofusion. I wouldn't say it's the best sushi in Champaign/Urbana, but they do have some fun and interesting rolls to try. To date, they are still the only place locally I have found that has a roll with raw jalapeno, one of my favorites in sushi. Honestly, they'd probably get knocked down a star if it weren't for that one delightfully spicy roll.   I've not been for dollar sushi days on Monday, but it sounds like a great way to try new rolls.   Their lunch buffet is pretty good. They have a limited amount of sushi and what they do have is pretty safe: california rolls/fried rolls. They also have curry and salad on the buffet. It's a little pricier at over $10/person, but the food is good. Definitely worth a shot if you're interested in checking out some safer food options. For me, I want all things spicy! And they only really have wasabi for that."}
{"text":"We love the ambiance and the menu is often unique. I also like their only Korean main menu fare - bulgogi. I hope they keep this in the menu."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent sushi, good service, modern and eclectic. Great for a date, with friends, and relaxation."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here after my niece graduated; good service, my vegetable stir fry with udon noodles was so good...the sauce was amazing!  Desserts were tasty as well.  A tad pricey, but good for a celebration!  Had to park a couple of blocks away, but it was a Saturday and graduation, so..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. The food is a definite hard pass. I'm a pretty big fan of sushi, and, for the price, there are at least three other sushi bars in town that will both taste better and be a better value. The service was attentive, but overbearing. I felt very rushed on a very lazy afternoon.  Don't order any cocktails. Stick with beer. You can't screw up beer."}
{"text":"Went to try lunch buffet.  For $12.99 expected a bit more for the price.  I went to try their rolls.  Did not expect sashmi or really fancy rolls.  Instead they had what they called \"steam octopus with mountain vegetable\".  That was the only role and it sat in a little tray.  I've actually had better rolls at Chinese buffets.  All I got from the rolls was a lot of rice rolls in dried seaweed sheets.  Not very enjoyable.  The tempura fish was pleasant, but nothing I'd go out of my way for, for me it was a lighter version of fish from fish and chips disk.  The pickle/apple salad was good and added good contrast to the other items.  The miso soup could have been MUCH better if they kept it simple and only had miso, tofu and seawood.  Instead they had assorted vegtables and mushrooms in the brooth, which took away form what I like about miso, how simple it is to consume.  For a $7.99 buffets, I'd say it was ok, for $12.99, expected a lot more."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ko Fusion for about 3 years and probably won't stop anytime soon! Ko fusion has many different types of rolls, house rolls and classic rolls. The house rolls are more of Ko Fusion's specialty rolls; they are more expensive, but I think it is worth it. Classic rolls are around $8 and house rolls are around $13-$15.   They also have nigiri, but I don't like eating raw fish, so I haven't tried theirs. Hands down my favorite roll is the flaming phoenix. It is a masterpiece from start to finish. It come out flaming (just like the name says) and has many different elements of flavor to it.   The $1 sushi is Sunday and Monday. I would suggest trying the sampler if you are not familiar with their different kinds of rolls. After coming here many times, I know which ones I do and don't like. Just read the descriptions and you will be fine picking your sushi.   GO TO THE LUNCH BUFFET. They only serve 2-3 types of sushi, but you can stock up that day and get your fill. They also have doughnuts, spicy chicken, edamame , rice, and salad.   The outdoor seating is relaxing and has a good vibe. Just like any other restaurant, it is not preferable to sit outside when it is hot and humid. The space inside is cool and dark. It can get loud sometimes because the tables are close together.   I also enjoy their different types of tea. They switch out their tea selections frequently. It comes in a smaller sized pot, but the leaves are good for about 2-3 steepings.   Overall, I think Kofusion is a good spot for some solid sushi. It's great for birthdays and small gatherings. You can go as casual or dressy as you would like because it's a versatile restaurant."}
{"text":"Classy. Sushi. Need more be written? Sundays and Mondays are the days to be here for $1 sushi night!  Beautiful ambience and food is fresh and well platted.  They have lovely outdoor seating and can accommodate large parties. **host stand is not the most attentive and watch out for the heavy beads on the way to the loo**"}
{"text":"GREAT lunch buffet!  I can't say anything didn't taste really good....they had an assortment of salad, fried rice, egg rolls, chicken dish, pork dish, seafood cakes, bean donuts, a couple sushi rolls.  Definitely worth trying for $10!"}
{"text":"Love that they now have an on-campus location. The menu isn't as big as the one downtown BUT if you ask (and they have the resources) they will make you pretty much anything from the downtown menu. Still have a wide variety of things on their smaller menu and a great on-the-go sushi option for students on campus. This is my fave sushi place on campus :)"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is such a rip off for what you're paying. The $1/piece \"sushi\" (if you can even call it that) is intended for snobby people who want to say they're eating sushi but just can't stand the thought of anything fresh or served raw. Kofusion is considered a counter-serve fast-casual place like Chipotle or Panera, so I can't seem to understand how it takes them so long to serve customers especially since customers can clearly see all the \"sushi\" sitting in little bins right on the counter and they just need to be put onto plates.   Side note: two friends and I came in at 8:30pm and Ko closes at 9pm. Even though there was still half an hour until closing, we did apologize for coming in so close to the time all employees want to start leaving. We just ordered two orders of veggie dumplings (10 dumplings total) and in a matter of 5 minutes were served, but this is only because our dumplings were cold and floppy and still raw! Even when we brought it to their attention, the employee said \"that's how they're supposed to be.\" We've had Ko dumplings before and although they are a cheap, filling alternative for $3 not meant to be memorable, the employee clearly insulted our intelligence by saying that's how they always are. No, you were just too lazy to not give us food poisoning with raw food."}
{"text":"I think people like this place based on the fact that it's a \"trendy\" little place in Champaign and they probably feel cool going there.  The decor reminds me of IKEA with fish tanks and the food and drinks are decent, nothing spectacular. I do like the fact that it 's downtown and has an outside patio- which is awesome in the summer! All in all, not a bad place, just not worth all the hype."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! Where to start? They have some of the best sushi in town! I usually get spicy tuna rolls. My husband is a bit more adventurous so I like to nosh on whatever he has ordered, too. Although I have never intentionally eaten uni, I can share that my husband loves to get a piece or two whenever we come.  This place also has some great entree and dessert options. They have a great wagyu beef entree with potatoes and vegetables that is absolute perfection. Additionally, they have a trio of ice creams that are so, so delicious.  Drinks are always good. Service is usually pretty good (they lose a point because this is not always the case). If you do not like overstimulation, avoid Kofusion unless it is warmer out. The outdoor seating is lovely but can lead to spending a lot of money on mojitos. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Best place for sushi. Ever. It can be a little pricey but that's why you go on Sundays or Mondays when its $1 a piece. I've tried the steak and noodles here which are really good too. But my favorite is still the sushi. The service can be slow when the place is packed, but I've never had anything worse than that. The deserts are really really good too. Go for the creme brulee or the fried cheesecake.   This is definitely a place to go to on a date or when you're in the mood to go out with friends at night. Has a classy yet casual feel to it."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be as simple as possible for the overall review:   It's a subpar restaurant at an above average price, unless you're having the dollar sushi. Then it's almost acceptable for the quality of the sushi you get.  Everything else is pretty mediocre, yet they're charging for a higher end restaurant price. You're paying for atmosphere and that's about it.   Yet, this is the best sushi place located in the CU area in terms of quality. So if you're desperate for sushi and have loads of money, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Living in the midwest, you have to understand that sushi options are limited. Kofusion more than satisfies this. They have an expansive sushi menu that caters to every sushi lover, as well as a lunch/dinner menu with some tasty meat and vegetarian options.  The food is always fresh - the coconut shrimp with mango is out of this world, as is the volcano roll.   I've had the shiro and maguro nigiri numerous times - it's always consistently good.  The dining area is nice - trendy, semi-upscale with private rooms for larger parties."}
{"text":"Have gotten takeout here many times previous, have finally made the dollar sushi night. Service was very attentive and nice. Like that we tried different maki rolls that normally we wouldn't order. Had the sake sangria cocktail which was delicious and refreshing in a hot summer night."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for night out after several friends recommended it. It's safe to say that this is now our favorite spot on town. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, the food is terrific, and the ambience is modern but calming. I can't wait for our return trip!"}
{"text":"Kofusion is not good unless you go for the buffet which is open on the weekdays. The place is a bit dark inside, but the service is good and energetic. I would only go here for the buffet."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and sashimi with a full menu and plenty of drinks. Great service but a muted atmosphere. Can be pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"The Chicago style and rainbow roll are both pretty good. The self service portion of the restaurant is very convenient as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Kofusion several times. The interior is very modern and sleek. The entrees are pricey and portions are on the smaller side. The servers are friendly and attentive. The $1 sushi deals on Sundays and Mondays are worth it. My favorite is definitely the big roll; I believe it has egg, crabmeat, avocado and some other stuff, then tempura fried with some sort of sauce on top.   The best deal...and I'm kinda mad that I found out right before I graduated...is the lunch buffet! It's sucha great deal. Only weekdays though. The buffet is only around $10 and includes various entrees, such as curry chicken, fried fish croquettes, kimchi, soup, fried rice, noodles and three different types of sushi. The big roll is usually one of the three. Definitely keeps you full without breaking your wallet. :)"}
{"text":"won't lie, i recently had tasted all the sushi restaurants in the URBANA/ Champaign area, and concluding that Kofusion was the best, too much carrots or using cucumbers as wrap arent as good, but besides that i enjoy the atmosphere, service was alright, but its in the middle of no where, i'm a big sushi critic this place is the best place to go in champaign."}
{"text":"We came here for date night.. Our server was AWESOME and I really wish I could remember her name, I believe it was Charlotte. She was the sweetest, most energetic and attentive server! She was knowledgable of the menu and drinks. I ordered the green tea she recommended and absolutely loved it. My boyfriend and I must have ordered 5-6 different kinds of rolls and demolished everything.. The sushi was fresh, beautifully displayed, and tasted awesome. Definitely pay Kofusion a visit if you're looking for fresh sushi and awesome service!"}
{"text":"People can say what they want about the sushi here. And, yes, I realize, that it might lack authenticity as some other places. The bottom line is, it's good and that is what food should be-good! The big roll and creamy shrimp are my favorites, with the popper (the ridiculous bacon, cream cheese, and fried) one is great. Also, the stir-fry is incredible. Just go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"A solid Asian fusion establishment, but for this genre of food, I prefer Sakanaya.   Mojito was better than expected.  The apps we ordered were A-OK, but nothing stellar: veggie and chicken potstickers and edamame.  For my entree, I ordered a couple pieces of toro sashimi (new to the menu!), which is fatty tuna, and it was deliciously fatty and not chewy at all.  I also had the bulgogi, and the dinner portion was smaller than expected.  So, as you might guess, I inhaled it all."}
{"text":"There is couple Kofusion restaurant located in the U of I campus.  I think this is the main one with larger tables, outdoor settings, some music and etc.  The food is alright, in my opinion, though it is not the first choice.  We went there with friends couple months ago and the waiters were very kind and making sure we were having a good time :)  The price is slightly high for the quality of the food.  If you're looking for something quick and easy parking, then Kofusion it is."}
{"text":"Great sushi and I especially love dollar sushi nights (sunday and monday nights).  Everything seems really fresh and the sushi rolls are a bit more inventive than other sushi places in the area. A little on the pricy side for most of the week.  Great atmosphere, service can be a little slow earlier in the afternoon, or during dollar sushi nights (it's always really busy)."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Had my first date here with my wife two and a half years ago.  Glad the food was too-notch!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed consistently good service and food here.   The sushi is good albeit a bit expensive (the dollar sushi special puts the price closer to what you might expect). I love the big roll so I always get it and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try something easy to eat.   The entrees are always a little pricey but are usually quite good (and maybe a bit on the salty side).  Overall, I would give Kofusion a good recommendation for anyone in the area that wants to try some sushi in a trendy setting."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my husband. First off, the parking lot is metered, so if you go during the week bring change. We didn't do that so when we went in I asked to get change for a dollar to go pay for my parking. The person at the desk told me they were not authorized to open the drawer, so apparently rather than going to get a manager to open the drawer so I could pay to park so I could eat there, I was turned away. What kind of customer service is that? Crap is what I say! We walked across the street to get change at a very nice Irish pub, where we decided to dine since we were offered change when we asked for it with no problems."}
{"text":"Off the $1 piece menu, the fried cocoanut mango shrimp is honestly so good. Would highly recommend this it tastes amazing."}
{"text":"It was interesting going to this location and seeing how different it is from the fast casual Urbana location.  It was much more upscale with the uplighting, the darker atmosphere and the fish tank.  The sushi was pretty good, the quality was pretty much identical to the Urbana location which is what I anticipated.  Overall a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"For sushi, this place is good enough. They kind of ruined my excitement because they use dairy cream in their penang curry - not vegan - and my favorite dish. Their vegetarian/vegan sushi rolls are overall pretty boring. They could definitely stand for some additional flavor. I'm not sure I'd return since I'm vegan, but I do recommend it for non-vegans!"}
{"text":"A-OK is the perfect way to describe this place. The sushi is not amazing, but it's good. The service is so-so. The prices are a bit higher than I'd like to pay for what I'm getting...    Apart from the food, the place is pretty clean. Not that this matters that much, but the music here is always on point. Props to whoever is deejaying @ Ko-Fusion... Your playlist is on point!"}
{"text":"There is a Kofusion on campus here at U of I, and the atmosphere is fast-food like. You order at the counter, receive a number, and someone brings your food out to you. My roommate works there so I am a regular, but a week ago the hockey team rented out a reception room at the downtown Kofusion location on Main Street off campus. My experience was a solid 10/10. I was impressed by everything from the venue, to the service, to the food especially. The waitresses were so personable and kind, and tolerated my excessive questions about the \"best\" and \"most adventurous\" sushi rolls to try. I went with their recommendations and I was so pleased. The sushi rolls I ordered tasted so fresh, and were carefully plated beautifully. One of my rolls even came out in flames. My whole experience was one to remember (and fairly priced!); I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Expensive and underwhelming.  I understand this is a fusion bar but to have sushi on the menu, at least have some fish on it. I came for the $1 sushi on Sunday and ended up getting 20 pieces (so $20 without tax), and literally everything on the menu was either imitation crab or cream cheese or a mixture of both. The pieces of sushi that were $1 each were also super tiny, like i'm pretty sure you could get 6 of those pieces for $5...in downtown CHICAGO and it'd be made with REAL FISH. If you like a ton of cream cheese, measly bits of dried tuna mixed with cream cheese and imitation crab, then maybe you'll like this \"fusion\" sushi place.   Would pick Umai over this...any time."}
{"text":"I've been to Kofusion for lunch twice now.  Both times I have enjoyed the food and the ambiance.  My favorite is the Big Roll.  Although, they really need to hire better servers (or train them better.)  Not impressed with their knowledge or service manner."}
{"text":"Well crap, I might be about to earn a bitch-badge.  The interior decor to me is not hip, trendy, or modern.  Unless you think that one friend with his blacklight room, lava lamps and Spencers Gifts-like light gadgets is awesome.  In which case, carry on my friend.  To each his own and all.  Got take-out.  Called ahead for lunch sushi sampler and tempura.  Perhaps the first indication should've been my order takers complete stupification upon hearing they offered a sushi sampler.  They told me food would be ready in 20 min.  Which was almost exactly how long I waited after arriving 20 min later.  Not cool on the service tip, Ko.  Sushi was fairly good, no complaint there.  The \"tempura\"?  So not.  Not tempura at all.  More like the deep fried veggies sold at a county fair.   No win for you, Ko, and no second visit.  Ever."}
{"text":"My family of five comes here fairly often. It is a little pricey but always excellent. We are pescatarians so we haven't tried the beef or chicken stuff - we always get rolls and sometimes salads.  The rolls are always great - flaming Phoenix, Chicago, rainbow etc.   Yum!    I don't like their lunch buffet because it's fried stuff and mostly meat and chicken, last time I checked anyway.  I believe this Champaign location has a more extensive menu than the Urbana (campus) location."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Champaign. I spent four years in C-U, and came back here several times, most of which for Dollar Roll Night.  Although many reviews have said that the service is slow, particularly on Dollar Roll Nights (Sunday and Monday nights), I have never had this experience. I would go with a friend or six, and the service was always fast enough that no one would really complain. Prices are a bit on the high side, but the quality of the food justifies that, both on and off the Sushi menu. Seriously though, the non-sushi menu is very good and highly underrated.  If there is one drawback to Ko-Fusion, it is that it can get very noisy during dinner service, particularly on Dollar Roll Nights. However, the food is good, the service is not as bad as people make it out to be, and the food justifies the prices."}
{"text":"I've only ordered carry out so I can only speak to the quality of the sushi, and I have to say I wasn't overly impressed. I ordered literally all of the dollar sushi items and did not love any of them. They were fine, but nothing noteworthy to me. If you value sushi quality over atmosphere (like me), I'd probably recommend Sakanaya and even Miga. Again, it seems like it has a nice ambiance inside but I cannot speak to that."}
{"text":"So I just came back from a trip at Champaign and found lots of new eateries. I was really happy with a lot of them but the only one I didn't really like was kofusion. The staff was extremely rude after I told them I found some sort of critter leg in my food. Instead of apologizing, they dared to claim that I planted it in there myself... wow, just WOW. The food itself was subpar at best too, not bad but slightly below average. Sorry, no love from this Cali boy."}
{"text":"It's better than the worst reviews here say. I too came on dollar sushi day so obviously the price was just right. The waitstaff was a little harried but it was extremely busy, but they really tried very hard to be attentive. Brian, our server was racing back and forth and came by often to check but when I did need something it was a little hard to get him. He did get back with me as soon as he could with any request I had and was quick with the refills of their Jasmine/Green tea.  I got a couple pieces of their $ sushi. The waygu beef was really good, and it was cooked all right-not over done-the right shade of pink. The dynamite roll was also really tasty-really savory and I was surprised that they didn't skimp on the fish.  I also got the Hwe Dop Bop which our server didn't know what it was until I pointed it out on the menu. Hwe Dop Bop, by the way is like bibimbap but with sashimi, like the Korean version of chirashi. It didn't come with the 'spicy, red sauce' that it was supposed to come with and I brought this up and he said it already comes with but he could bring me more-that was a little weird that he didn't even look at my dish. However, he did bring me more without asking when I used up what he gave me.   Not a bad place, I would probably show up here again if I'm in the CU area, but probably not for $1 sushi-too busy."}
{"text":"This place is cute, trendy in champaign, and always packed.  The staff here are very friendly, sushi is good (try the volcano, spicy tuna) and drinks are tasty.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely awful no matter what day of the week you go. I have been here a handful of times and have not once gotten good service. Sushi is alright but nothing fantastic."}
{"text":"I am new to the area. I have have plenty of sushi and Ko Fusion is on  My fav list"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Went here when we were visiting some friends at U of I & ... I'm sorry, but for their prices, the sushi could be A LOT better. I'm not really a sushi snob and I'm definitely down for paying a good amount of money for really good sushi. This place gave me mediocre sushi for a higher price. No thanks. Also, they messed up my order & this chef (who literally looked like he just rolled out of bed b/c he looked so disheveled) gave me a lecture about their fish & how I was mistaken. If I wanted a lecture with my food, I'd go to class & eat. Relearn how to treat your customers, make your sushi taste amazing & present it in a way where I want to cry... then I'll come back. Till then, I'd rather just eat cocomero all day when I'm there."}
{"text":"We called in for appetizer trays of assorted sushi and rolls.  The fish was prepared perfect and was some of the freshest I've ever had.  No fish smell.   The nice lady I worked with was very professional and accommodating even staying open 30 min later for us to take away our order on a Sunday.  The price of sushi vary greatly in parts of the USA but I would say this was on the high side.  I would recommend this place to someone with out hesitation as long as they realize this is not a budget meal."}
{"text":"Don't care about the decor or anything. I've only gone on Sunday/Monday so I can't speak to the restaurant on Tuesday-Saturday. At the same time, I'll probably keep going.   I really like the tuna crunch roll, like a lot. As oddly specific as this might be, it is in my top 5 pieces of sushi ever. The bulk of my 10-12 pieces usually consist of these guys. I also enjoy the wagyu beef and BBQ pork roll, which are sort of a nice change up. People also seem to enjoy the big roll, though I take a pass because I'm not a fan of mushrooms.  OK, so that necessarily doesn't earn the 4 star rating. It's good, relatively inexpensive (unless you're trying to eat 392 pieces) and the location is good. What gets the extra star is that the service is always on point and great. Knowing that people cherry picking what types of sushi they want can cause an error prone environment, the servers (and I suppose cooks/sushi-makers) usually get it right. When they don't, it's fixed quickly.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a wide variety of seating available from indoors of tables and booths and even outdoor seating. I enjoy coming for their dollar sushi and have not found one I dislike. If there are any non-sushi lovers in the group they even have one called the \"big roll\" which contains no fish. I personally enjoy the spicy tuna and coconut shrimp rolls but do recommend any on their menu."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not that big of a fan of Kofusion. I had the beef stir fry with udon noodles, and the taste was only OK. I liked the beef strips but they are only so much of them. I thought that the sauce was too overpowering. Plus the dish costed $12, which is on the pricey side for the portion size given. In my opinion, there are better Asian food places on campus."}
{"text":"Very good fast sushi. The go to place when you're in Champaign at the University of Illinois. I let my daughter choose because she knows what I like! What don't you love about a dollar apiece sushi?"}
{"text":"Swanky for a Shampoo Banana restaurant, so if you want to class it up to impress that special someone, Kofusion is a great choice.  Food-wise it's not quite as impressive...though the sushi is pretty good. The entrees are hit or miss -- I've had some stellar meals here, but sometimes they seem to be having off days."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with this location. Much different and less classy than the downtown location, but still just as good. Dollar sushi any day was also a great surprise. Service was good and very clean location. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We go every Sunday for their dollar sushi and have had a good time most times! Last two times we've went, service has been garbage. We'll get seated right away but it seems that the servers have to argue about who's section is whos. Very disorganized staff. Have had long waits just for drinks. Food tastes great and looks good. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I called them up on a Friday night (after checking Google and noticing their close time as 11 PM) to double-check their kitchen hours. I was told it was indeed 11 pm. We were denied a table when we went at 9.55 PM because they were closing at 10 PM and because the chef gave the stink eye to the waitress who was willing to seat us."}
{"text":"Horribly overpriced, but on Mondays the specials are a good buy and a delight of variety.  I won't come any other day of the week, but on Monday this place is a go-to-spot for sushi.  Good service but occasionally a little slow."}
{"text":"Definitely a pleasant surprise! The decor is a bit trendy for my taste, and being a Californian particular about my Asian food, I wasn't expecting to be impressed.  But I was wrong!  Clearly a popular spot based on the crowd, the service is good and the food excellent (panang curry and stir fry) - from customers that know good curry and stir fry!  Fresh vegetables and smart spicing, along with excellent preparation.  Nicely done."}
{"text":"YUM. The BEST sushi in all of Champaign. Monday nights are dollar sushi nights (a great deal) and I try to make it here at least 2 or 3 times when I come back to visit for Christmas.   The big roll (their special house roll) is amazing and huge. I've had many other unique and interesting sushis here as well. Edamame is also quite tasty. And the peach tea is some of the best tea I've ever had. The decor is pretty stylin and if you come at the right time, you don't have to wait very long, if at all, to get a table.   Never had an entree here, only sushi."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of months since my visit, but this was one of the best sushi places I've been.  Great ambiance - cool blue lighting, modern finishes, and a neat moving waterfall behind the bar.  Our server was knowledgable, friendly, and attentive (even though we came later into the evening slightly before close).    I can't recall my fiancee dish, but I had the flaming phoenix (based on our servers suggestion) and it was as delicious as it was entertaining to watch.  They certainly didn't skimp us on the presentation at that late hour.  We would definitely recommend to others and will come back here again on our next Champaign trip!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Kinda pricy but worth every penny. Classy as shit. Try the crab cheese whatever. Itll make you change your orientation."}
{"text":"a bit contrived visually but decent midwestern sushi.  i've never gotten sick from the sushi so i keep convincing myself that it must be ok to eat it.  our kids love the sushi here and the waterfall that runs the back wall of the bar.  it's very nice to sit outside in the summer and enjoy a light dinner while sipping a glass of wine.  the rest of their menu is ok but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Probably about as cool as the Champaign dining scene gets...at least from my limited exposure to it. In a town, though, lacking in nicer Asian fare, it's disappointing that Kofusion's menu strays into French, American and Italian food, but I guess that's why \"fusion\" is in the name of the restaurant. My dinner selections focused on Japanese items, which were of high quality - sashimi pieces were HUGE and sushi rolls, while small, were mostly tasty. I was fairly impressed at how fresh the fish was, but taken aback by how costly the sushi was.  Patrons seemed to mostly be from the university - a bunch of students and some professorial types. Kofusion certainly is the place to see and be seen in downtown Champaign and it's going to be a place I'll surely check out every time I visit the in-laws."}
{"text":"As always, a great experience on our last visit Monday night. The place was packed! But we were seated quickly, our server was attentive, and the food was great!  We just went in for drinks and sushi this time, but have several favorites from the menu as well. My son loves the veggie dumplings.  The Chicago roll is delicious.  A fun night out!  Also, great to see the owner in the front of the house. Very nice evening out!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, but the price is that of a GREAT sushi place.  Maybe I just got spoiled in California with amazing and cheap sushi but the only thing that made me stand up and take notice about Kofusion was the check.  It is still the best sushi place in CU so I'll be back.  My wallet just won't be happy."}
{"text":"Good food but they use imitation crab in their rolls.  For the price and marketing their \"fresh seafood\", that's just shameful."}
{"text":"I had the chance to eat here twice while in he Urbana/Champaign area while on business.  I had the coconut shrimp mango roll and the Chicago roll. Both were excellent. They have a nice selection of sashimi nagiri as well. I will definitely eat here again when I have the chance."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and relaxing.  I enjoy visiting downtown Champaign.  My friends and I all ordered sushi of many different varieties and all of us thought is was good.  Not exceptional, but good.  The reason for the lower rating was the service which was some of the worst I've ever seen.  Our waiter seemed thoroughly annoyed when we requested a minute to look over the menu before ordering.  He practically threw everything he brought to us, at us.  And literally put some of the sushi plates down so hard that the rolls fell over.  He didn't check back until he very rudely put the check down and walked away.  We had to ask other tables for soy sauce as we could not get his attention.    Overall, we ate our food and left quickly to go elsewhere to enjoy drinks because we felt like our presence was annoying to him and this ruined our experience. The one round of cocktails we did have were enjoyable and it was disappointing that we weren't comfortable staying for a few more rounds."}
{"text":"Dollar sushi Sunday. You can't beat that.  Their servers do a good job. I've came here many times and only have had one slip up but it was a waiter I haven't seen before so I'll let it slide. It's always very busy here but that's not a bad thing. I always have a good time here.  If you don't like sushi their chicken stir fry is amazingggg and a large portion. I always get to take some home!"}
{"text":"I've gone here for dollar sushi Mondays, weekday lunch buffets (one of the best ever), birthday dinners and other celebrations. It has a great ambiance and terrific sushi! Their regular dishes are phenomenal too. I highly recommend you try the lunch buffet sometime, though. They had this savory caramelized chicken dish that blew my mind. Their desserts are great too. It's always a great experience!"}
{"text":"It can be pretty loud in there but the patio is where its at in the spring. Delicious sushi and a fun play to be with friends!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! I tried the big roll. It's so creamy inside and also crunch outside. So good! And the server is nice! Recommend!"}
{"text":"I was in Urbana, IL for a few days on business. I dined at two restaurants and this was one of them.  The place was rather empty, but that's because it was Halloween evening.  With that being said, the interior design is pretty cool but feels a bit cold. I had a couple of things on the menu. I had the halibut as my main dish and the california roll just for fun. I was very stuffed by the end of the evening. I liked both dishes.  I think Ko Fusion needs to focus on one cuisine. It's trying to be everything to everyone. But what I had was tasty. The outside signage says 'Steak Pizza Sushi Seafood.' What the hell kinda combination is that? I'd go back if I was in town. :)"}
{"text":"Went there tonight with friends for dollar sushi because it's usually one of our favorite spots. HOWEVER, I had a very negative experience tonight and I will not be going back. Let me tell you why. First off, we had waited over an hour for our food and when it arrived it was cold (which we found out after a few bites). We had asked our waiter if he could replace our food with freshly made/hot food. He asked the manager and he said that they were only going to replace what was left on our plate. We understood but wanted to talk to the manager in person about our poor experience thus far. The owner/manager is Janet. As we were talking to her, calmly I might add, she started raising her voice to us and said \"If you don't like it you can leave\". We hadn't done anything wrong and she was literally \"shooing\" us out of the restaurant. We asked if we could talk to another, more reasonable manager. She replied that she was the owner and the only manager. We then asked for her name. She said that she wasn't going to tell us her name!!! After telling us to \"get the hell out\" and threatening to call the police we then asked a waiter for her name. After finding out her name we left. Unsatisfied with just her name and no clue who else we can talk to about this extremely poor service, myself and one of my friends went in to calmly ask the hostess if she knew anyone else we could talk to because obviously Janet was too unreasonable and unprofessional to talk to. She spotted us and continued to yell at us to \"get the hell out\". Even yelling to my female friend that she was disgusting. A male server then proceeded to physically shove us out of the restaurant. Keep in mind, I am never one to be angry or be assertive in these types of situations. However, this was ridiculous! I have no idea how she is a manager of anything!"}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet = Awesome!!  Much better deal than $1 sushi!  They had korean glass noodles, red curry, egg rolls, tempuras, some kind of soup, and 3 sushi rolls, and probably more stuff that I left out. The food was all good."}
{"text":"I love the walnut goat cheese salad and shrimp tempura.  The food and service are always exceptional.  This is in my top 5 of Chambana.  It is a family favorite and they make our small children feel welcome."}
{"text":"The Kofusion is known to be overpriced and that has not deterred me from going there frequently previously, because I thought the food quality, particularly the sushi, was good. However, I have noticed the food quality has decreased significantly while the price has gone up. One example is lunch buffet, which used to be $9.99 and have plenty of choices, including several sushi rolls, edamame, spring/egg rolls, rice, and chicken & beef dishes. Now the price has been increased to $11.99, but the selections and quality have decreased quite a bit. I went there for lunch today and found no edamame or spring/egg rolls, only California Rolls as a choice for sushi rolls, with \"Spicy Tuna rolls\" sign next to an empty tray. I went back a little later to try to pick up some spicy tuna rolls and found the sign was replaced with \"Vegetable rolls\". I asked the server and then manager why they replaced the spicy tuna rolls with the cheaper and lower-quality vegetable rolls in the middle of lunch time (around 12:30pm), the manager initially said they ran out of spicy tuna rolls, and then changed her story that they only serve the spicy tuna rolls on certain days, but not today, and today they are supposed to serve only vegetable rolls and California rolls. If you can see the photo I uploaded, please note how much rice in the vegetable rolls and how much green vegetables and barely any avocado in the California rolls. I feel sad that Kofusion, which used to be my favorite restaurant that I take my VIP guests to showcase high-quality sushi in Midwest, has reached such a low point."}
{"text":"Update:  I finally returned after many years of being away from the university.  Their specialty rolls are probably the way to go.  Not great.. but make an expensive experience less horrible.  The rainbow roll was by far their worse.    Then tried the crunchy roll and the flaming phoenix.  Those were both decent rolls.  Then it was better when we washed it down with a bunch of Manhattans and vodka martinis. ********************************************************************* It's hip and chic decor (so it gets one star) is not enough to make for their HORRIBLE FOOD.  I can't even believe it's a sushi place... somebody that really likes raw fish would never eat here.  Their sushi has almost no fish.    Their $1 sushi Mondays suck because it's $1 per piece.. and the sushi doesn't taste good.  I have gone three times.. and I will never return.  I'd rather drive forty minutes to eat in Bloomington, IL.  There are better sushi restaurants there."}
{"text":"While the restaurant was gorgeous and the staff was well trained, I must say for the price you are paying I expect to get super fresh tasting fish. I ordered the chirashi (my go to dish at sushi places when I am not sharing) And while the portion was decent,  the tuna and octopus both tasted slightly off, like it was old. The other fish on the plate,  while fresh, just didn't have a lot of flavor. In short you pay a lot for pretty average fish, almost 1.5-2x what I would pay for the quality I recieved(depending on the dish)  there are many better places in the area, that have tastier fish and are a bit more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Big fan of the coconut shrimp sushi, and the ambiance! Usually get take out but sat down for lunch recently. Jenna (I think?) was my server, and she was phenomenal. Not too overbearing, very friendly, and checked on me at just the right times. Also, the raspberry cheesecake is SO GOOD. Reminds me of the delicious raspberry mousse cake that Jewel used to have, but discontinued a few years ago. For how full you get off of the food, definitely a little overpriced but the quality makes up for it."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place on campus! The Urbana location is perfect for students because they always offer dollar pieces. It's quick and I've never had poor service. The only thing I wouldn't recommend here are the pork dumplings. They're very hard, not the normal soft dumpling! The Champaign location is also great, it's just more fancy and isn't just a quick lunch stop."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place on campus, and I can honestly say I will miss it when I graduate this semester! They have a huge list of options, and everything comes at a pretty fair price. One of the biggest perks about Kofushion is that every Sunday they offer dollar pieces. This is great for us college students on a budget. At the on-campus location they offer dollar pieces every day, but sometimes these pieces aren't always the freshest. However, for a college campus sushi restaurant I love it and 9/10 times I'm very happy with my order."}
{"text":"When friends ask me to describe this restaurant, I jokingly say, \"It's the kind of place where people eat their sushi with a fork and knife.\"  To Kofusion's credit, it's the only venue in this rural Midwest town that attempts the urban dance-club sushi experience. Against that backdrop, it really is filling a unique niche. East Coast + West Coast elitist diners will likely be unimpressed (if you're ensnared here for years due to work or school, the nostalgia/desperation for big city experiences might change your mind).  Arguably, if you're eating at an Asian fusion restaurant, you should have no expectations of \"authenticity\" in regards to the food. The drink selection features fruity cocktails with sexy, \"exotic\" names and $9+ price tags. Many items on the menu are outright American cuisine lacking even a hint of \"fusing\" with Asian elements. In that respect, this place is ideal for groups made up of both adventurous diners and those who fear \"fish breath.\"  The biggest draw for Kofusion are the Sunday and Monday $1 sushi specials. Folks with raw food aversions need not worry. All of the $1 sushi options are variations of deep-fried meats, cream cheese filling, and mayonnaise/sugary sauces. There's such a demand on these nights that the preparation definitely cuts corners--but if you're filling up on these bite-sized heart-attacks, you're likely channeling your inner fat kid and won't mind the rushed presentation.  For people who love Japanese cuisine for its delicate, clean flavors, the sushi bar also serves more \"traditional\" fare, though I've sometimes received pieces of sashimi sliced rather clumsily.  My advice: the $1 price tag for the Sunday/Monday specials requires such little investment that it's worth a shot for new diners. It might even be the best opportunity for initiating people who are normally turned off by the idea of sushi."}
{"text":"Their california rolls is awesome, but is too expensive.... Went their an afternoon and other people paid for it .."}
{"text":"Service good, great sushi, love their organic-wild caught-natural food selection such as Scottish Salmon, grass fed beef etc. Sometime have brown rice. Nice atmosphere, bit modern, lovely patio"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Kofusion on a Tuesday, so it was not nearly as crowded as on dollar sushi nights (Sundays AND Mondays).  The first thing you notice is the décor:  indoor seating is cozy, with an outdoor patio section, ambient lighting and nice candles on the tables (a small detail, but something I love :)    My friend had sushi rolls while I had select pieces of nigiri (salmon, smoked salmon, tuna, shrimp, and tuna caviar).  Now this review may be biased due to the weeks of sushi-deprivation I had experienced prior to coming in...but the food was delicious!  The pieces were well-cut, artfully arranged, and you could tell the fish was good quality.  The best part of the night (aside from the great company) was the service.  The waiter was very friendly, entertaining, and came by many times to checkup on us.  The service really took the whole dining experience up a notch.      P.S.  The mojitos were great too!  Will definitely be coming back for more sushi and drinks nights."}
{"text":"Food is generally good but the service has been hit or miss. The servers tend to get noticeably overwhelmed on busy night (e.g. dollar sushi) and there can be long delays. The quality of the food is high and Ko-Fusion does a good job of simulating your typical big city Asian-Fusion, neon lights, lounge music type place. The dollar sushi is a great deal and the rotating options are tasty though sort of cheapish in that they feature a lot of imitation crab based rolls. However for a buck a piece, it's a fair enough trade-off. On my last visit, my gf and I each ordered tea and the server forget which pot was which. To check she practically shoved her nose in one pot to take a whiff and figure it out. Ko-Fusion is good but not great."}
{"text":"Over priced! Way too expensive for not the best quality of food. Really expected more. Sub par sushi."}
{"text":"It's only worth coming here for the rolls.  Everything else that I've tried is a ridiculous ripoff.  With that said, their \"fusion\" sushi actually works pretty well!  Apple smoked bacon and unagi roll?  Tasty indeed.  Their other novelty rolls are extremely tasty as well.  However, their traditional sushi isn't that great.  Every other time we're in town we find ourselves getting the salmon triangles, which are truly unique in an onigiri sort of way.  It reminds me of that \"fan tuan\" at Taiwan 7-Elevens, cept with salmon!    This place is on the expensive side, but this is my favorite \"rolls\" place in Champaign.  Note that I say rolls, and not sushi in general."}
{"text":"I didn't love it. I wanted to. I skipped lunch as we drove down to Champaign from Madison for a research meeting. Be aware of the other Kofusion located in Urbana, just minutes away!  The intense blue lighting outside made the place memorable for people in our group who were coming back to Kofusion for the second time. They couldn't remember the name, but they remembered the blue lighting as you walk to up to the restaurant.  The fish in the aquarium looked a little sad. Perhaps... they were traumatized by the fact that this place serves sushi. eh eh (remark credit goes to another person in our group). The overall decor was pleasant though, a decent spot for a date or business meeting.  Our server was really nice, but my food was just so-so. I got stir fry with rice and shrimp. The shrimp started to freak me out because they were luke warm at best. I think this was an issue because we had a group on the larger end (9 people). The portion size was good, and the stir fry had a good flavor, but for the price, I didn't think my money was really well spent.  There was the option for private room if that's something of interest to you. I'm not sure if that is extra or gratuity is included, etc.  The quality of the food and the price mostly lead to my overall 3 star rating."}
{"text":"I've only been here for dollar sushi, so keep that in mind. I actually like the sushi here. The service has been mostly good. You'd think the wait would be crazy, but I've not really had to wait very long. They get you in and out, but it doesn't feel rushed. And $10 for a full sushi dinner is pretty good in my books. I want to try on another night, just to check out the entrees."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for my birthday.  Service was outstanding, best service I've had in champaign, and I think paying a little extra for the food is balanced by a great staff.  They knew the menu well, every ingredient, knew the wine and beer, didn't come to the table too often or too seldom.  Definitely a good dining experience!  Atmosphere is really nice.  I guess the price didn't bother me too much, since this is what we were used to paying for a nice sit-down japanese meal in California, when we lived there.  Go eat here."}
{"text":"I often get dragged here every few weeks with coworkers since it is close to my work.  I have not been impressed one time.    I got to admit the inside is uniquely decorated, but I dislike almost everything else about this restaurant.  To start, the waiters are really rude and arrogant.  They all seem to have this pompous flair to them and I don't know why.  It most certainly does not make a good server.  They seem to act disgusted almost every time you ask them for something, and are neglectful of your table way more often that not.  It's not surprising for them to forget your table completely... The owner is also very arrogant, and acts sickeningly (and fake-ly) nice as she wanders aimlessly around the restaurant.    The food is alright, but most is very underwhelming to me.  The food is not very authentic, (aside from the sushi) and is more of an Americanized Asian restaurant (much like P.F. Changs), and I tend to hate those types of restaurants.  When I want Asian food, I want REAL Asian food.  Not crappy American creations labeled as Chinese food.    It's pretty expensive too.  Way overpriced in my opinion.  There is a $10 lunch buffet, but there are often only 4 entrees to choose from, and not much else in the ways of other food.  Fried and white rice?  Usually two plates of generic (and really cheap) sushi?  Totally not worth $10 at all.  Order from the menu for lunch and you are looking at paying over $10.    Dinner is even worse.  While I only went once for dinner, and usually end up here for the lunch buffet, the time I did go for dinner was terrible.  The menu is almost set up like a gourmet restaurant, as there's not a big selection at all, and most meals cost around $20.  O_O  The worst part is, the entrees come out on huge plates with the tiniest bit of food in the middle.  They call it New Age Dining but I call it \"I just got seriously ripped off\"  I ordered the salmon dish.  It was $21 I think.  Ridiculous, I know.  Well, it came out raw in the middle.  I sent it back, 10 minutes later it comes back, and still raw.  I had to send it back twice and even after the third time it came back it did not taste right to me.  And like I said, it was the tiniest portion ever.  It was maybe a 6oz salmon filet on a plate garnished with sauce next to like a 1/4 cup of rice.... it really is pitiful.  My friend's entrees were similarly scarce looking.    I really don't know how this place gets so packed when it is so expensive and the food is not that good.  It's touted as a huge date spot as well, but I'm surprised most stomach up the huge entry cost.  I hear the sushi is great but I never had anything other than the stuff they put out on the lunch buffet and it was terrible.  It seems expensive too like everything else.  Some praise the $1 sushi night, but that's per piece and personally to me that seems like a high price as well....    I would stay away if I were you, I often even find myself backing out of lunch with my coworkers simply because I can not stand this restaurant any more."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi place for central Illinois! We went on a Sunday, when they have a dollar-piece deal for some sushi rolls. Our server Cody was great. The vegetable tempura starter was delicious and good value ($9) for a large portion. We also got 30 pieces of sushi total from the dollar menu. The Big roll was the most delicious out of the ones we sampled (also the spicy crab, coco, dynamite, and tuna crunch). The sushi was generally fine, but as previous reviewers mentioned I would have liked to see more rolls with fresh fish (instead of imitation crab); that said, it's the middle of Illinois so I'd give this 4 stars nonetheless."}
{"text":"Fancy sushi. +1 star \"Meh\" service. Tipped 10% for lunch. -1 star Freezing inside in summer. -1 star  TIP:  If u r ordering tea pot, 1 pot is enough for 2 people.  Bring a cardigan or jacket of some sort if u r afraid of coldness.   Recommendation:  Pan fried pork dumplings - think they taste better than their sushi."}
{"text":"Honestly, the sushi I had from here was just okay. It's good if you want something quick or need it delivered (check out the delivery company Order Up), but otherwise I much prefer Sakanaya for sushi. The $1 bites are a cool concept but a lot of them just have cream cheese and stuff in them. Also, at $14 for a rainbow roll, the prices weren't very competitive. I don't think I'll come back to Kofusion unless I have to but I'm glad I gave them a try."}
{"text":"I had a nice lunch here the other day. Their lunch menu is very limited aside from sushi on the weekends so just be warned. However, they do have quite a selection of various rolls. Didn't try any nigiri/sashimi, so I can't comment on the quality of simple sushi. We only tried the volcano roll but it was delicious. I also had the angus beef stir fry with udon noodles which I liked a lot. It was tasty and had a good amount of vegetables. The price point is a little on the expensive side for what it is, especially with some of the house rolls. But, I did enjoy my meal here and would definitely come back if I was really craving some elaborate sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Ko Fusion is on my daily walk home from class and as a recently self-proclaimed sushi fan, I had to try it out. The $0.80/piece Hooked deal was the perfect excuse to get take-out on a weekday!  It's really clean on the inside and the décor was spot on for a quick-service campus place like this.  I decided to get one of everything and doubled up on a couple that I thought sounded good to fulfill the 10 piece limit on the Hooked deal. It was hard to tell which one was which on my plate, so I'll just say that I know for sure the Big, Popper, and Coconut stuck out the most to me. I felt the Cali was a bit lacking/plain and in general the rolls labeled \"spicy\" on the menu had little to no kick to them. I couldn't seem to pick up the jalapeno in any of the pieces either, maybe it was accidently omitted?  The people behind the counter are more than likely students and were very pleasant.  I would say that it does seem to be a little overpriced due to the pieces being considerably smaller than the rolls I'm used to, both in physical size and the amount of fish versus rice.  Do not get me wrong though, it is definitely a good option with the Hooked discounts, and would be a relaxing atmosphere to bring a virgin sushi friend to try it for the first time, since they could just order the sample pieces.  I will for sure give the house rolls and other entrees a try since Ko Fusion is in a great location."}
{"text":"I've been to the location on campus but have not been to the downtown Champaign location. I took my wonderful date here for some sushi on a Thursday night.  We started with 2 martinis which were on special for $5. Mine was alright but hers was better. I forget the names of them, I think one was a Dragon_____? Not bad, but I probably would not want to pay full price for them.  We each had a sushi roll. I had the fusion and she had the torched salmon. I also ordered two pieces of the nigiri which were on special, one was a red tuna and the other a yellowtail. They were both good but the red was the  better of the two. Not bad for only $2 each, but they weren't the biggest pieces of nigiri I've had.  The fusion roll was delicious. It had a nice crispy potato crunch on the outside and it was well-rolled and I could taste most of the ingredients quite well. My date said she like the torched salmon. I was a little disappointed to see that Ko Fusion does not include pickled ginger with their sushi rolls like most other sushi places do.  I think our server's name was Sarah. She was nice and very helpful. Service was good!  My only gripe with Ko Fusion was the price. After tax and tip, our meal and discounted drinks were over $50. I know sushi is not usually a huge portion, but my roll was only 8 pieces or so, I definitely wasn't full after it. The quality of the food was good, but I just thought the portion size was especially small to spend $50 between two people.   I'll have to go back and try the non-sushi items."}
{"text":"Kofusion has always been a solid option in downtown Champaign for years.  If not the best sushi I have had, but given that is Uchi in Houston or Austin so that is not completely fair, it is still serviceable.  The atmosphere is great and modern looking without being stuffy or overly chic for no reason.  The patio area is one of the best downtown.  The spot is always packed, even on a Monday during the summer when all the U of I students are gone.  So service is a little swamped, but they will check on you when they get a chance and kitchen times are usually spot on.  A handful of micros on tap.  Various offerings from Oskar Blues, Dogfish Head, and Bells.  Sushi can be anywhere from very good to meh.  There has been enough inconsistency for me to not give this a full four star.  Sometimes they just over do it, and other times it might not be the freshest.  My latest visit on Monday I had the Unagi roll, which is fresh water eel.  Very good, if not exceptional.  This was done in a very tasteful way and not over done, like some other rolls can be.    They just always fall short of exceptional to me.  Even so, that won't stop me from making other visits in the future.  They are a downtown staple, and try hard.  Certainly a good spot that sometimes falls a little short."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Paid 60 dollars for some tea and \"mains\" that left two of us very hungry and considering a run for red lobster.   Returned for dollar sushi upon all the good yelp reviews but found that it really wasn't worth it either. Lots of filler rice and sauces. Hardly any substance to any of the \"rolls\" by \"rolls\" they mean pieces, which really isn't a deal at all. Plus, really poorly done rice at that. Ick.  Very nice service but considering the food, I say go to Sushi Kame down the road instead."}
{"text":"If you're looking for sashimi this is not the place (over priced and not the freshest) but their sushi was great I love that you can order by the piece on Sunday's so I can try different things. Waiter was very pleasant and I appreciated the out door seating"}
{"text":"Too much for too little. I like the decor, the location, and I half-like the food. I hate the prices. I also hate it when people think that this is the best Sushi place in CU without trying the others.  Sushi is expensive. I also understand that not just any restaurant gets access to high quality fish, especially in bumble fuck Chambana. None of these justify the price premium KoFusion demands over the (superior IMHO) Yelowfin, not to mention the also rans Kamakura and Miko. If decor doesn't matter, and cost is an object (when is it not?) Sushi Kame is the best bet.  As for their rolls, I do think they can be good. When they are good, they are just as good as the above restaurants. When they are not, they suffer the same perennial complaints for not being well rolled or being skimpy. I have not heard any complaints that their fish was bad, and I grant that this in itself is an accomplishment. The chirashi is reputedly quite good, though I have not had it.  Their \"deal night\" is not really a deal. They get you in with the promise of a cheap meal, but the pieces that are $1 each are really tiny. If you are a person who normally orders 2 rolls, you will not be happy with your 10 small (but good) pieces. You will end up ordering an additional roll and maybe more. If that additional roll isn't one of the ones that are in the 10 pieces for $10 deal, prepare to wait for an eternity and a half."}
{"text":"Service terrible. Asked for a water 3 times, they brought one meal 10 mins before the others, and the others took a long time.   Sushi was decent and is only 1$ (select menu items) on Sundays and MAYBE Monday too."}
{"text":"This place was across the street from where I was staying when in town for a wedding.  A group of us came to dinner before going bowling and the guy who helped us was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  The ambiance in this place is really nice and I loved the fish tanks.  The tea we ordered was delicious.  I believe it was jasmine.  The sushi was good and many at our table got the flaming phoenix and that was very cool to see brought to the table.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal and our service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Ko Fusion is for the students and by the students. It's conveniently located right next to an apartment complex on campus and its employees are composed of college students. The whole environment exudes a very simple and clean style.   The food is quite fantastic. The stir fry is superb and the sushi is delicious. Its major fault is that it's definitely too expensive. The specialty rolls go from $13-$15 for 8 rolls and the rolls are smaller than other sushi places. However, they have a unique \"create your own sushi\" menu item for $9 for 8 rolls. This place would be perfect if the main entrees were $2 cheaper."}
{"text":"You clearly come to this place for the atmosphere. It's a good place to take a business client or to go on a date. I just wish the food was as good as the ambiance. You'll be paying for the atmosphere as well so expect to pay around $16 for a meal. I was surprised that there wasn't any tofu stir fry here; the items here are different than the Ko Fusion that's on the UIUC campus. How odd."}
{"text":"Duck was excellent!    Update: we returned more recently and tried the sushi, which was terrible -- it tasted like it had been frozen.  The menu is also completely random -- the restaurant doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: Korean, Japanese, American.  The food isn't *fusion*, its just three different types of cuisine on the same menu -- no one dish is a fusion of anything."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and did not partake in the buffet.  My parties food took FOREVER!!!  I was told it was because we did not order the buffet even though we ordered before most of the other parties were sat.  Lunch took almost two hours.  Unacceptable!  No apology and preferential treatment was given to other tables.  The food was mediocre at best.  Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty, my major complaint is with the price.  Wife and I were out nearly $45 after tip for a single roll each and a single beer.   Ouch."}
{"text":"I had sushi a la carte. The fish was fresh, but it came as extremely thin and small pieces on  small beds of rice. I expected more given their relatively high price range. I spent like 25 bucks, but could not fill myself up. I rarely complaint about the portion, but sushi there is like 70% size compared to the usual."}
{"text":"I had the $1 sushi here and it was average. Most of the $1 sushi had cream cheese or tempura as a filler which is why I'm sure it's only a buck a piece. I did not think that the fish quality here was very high as compared to other major cities but it *is* Champaign so I guess it's understandable. The service was good, and the location and ambiance were nice as well."}
{"text":"I've lived in Champaign my whole life, and I'd never eaten at K.O. Fusion before today. I'd heard a few people rave about the dollar sushi but most people say it's \"meh\". My friend invited me today to meet her for sushi at K.O. and I was looking forward to it.   We got there at 11:15, and the server was really nice and very attentive. That's about all I can give this place. I ordered a chicken Bento box that was $15 - I cringed when I saw the price, but the server reassured me that it was \"a LOT\" of food. The box came, and it had chicken stir fry that was pretty plain. Then it had 4 little pieces of California roll that were OK. There was a lump of rice that was undercooked. There were a few pieces of lettuce with an overpowering ginger sauce on it. I'm a very hungry person and I'm the least picky eater I know, and I didn't finish the Bento box. It's not because I wasn't hungry - it's because I couldn't. But what's more, there was certainly NOT $15 worth of food on that plate -- it wasn't \"a LOT\" of food.   I ordered veggie dumplings for my daughter, who seemed to liked them. I thought they were pretty good, but they were lukewarm (the server made a big deal about how hot they were - and they were definitely not).   The bill came and it was almost $25. For $25, I better have eaten the very best lunch of my life!! And I would've been more satisfied with a $5 footlong, sadly. This place is ridiculous. They have some nerve to charge so much money for food that's not even up to par with cheap fast food.   The other restaurants downtown, for the most part, are pretty good. They're still overrated, but better than K.O.! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love hate here. Had good experiences snd horrible. Overall i usually have a good meal and i like the decor. Expensive for the area but a good date night place."}
{"text":"KoFusion is like that neighborhood ice cream shop that you always go to because it's close by and it's never terrible. The popularity of the $1 sushi day has led to two locations, with this one being on campus. I actually prefer this location to the other one. It doesn't have outdoor seating like the Neil St. location but it's always extremely clean, the staff is very courteous and helpful, and it is just the right temperature for dining (I don't why some restaurants insist on being -4°F). The sushi is very Americanized so expect a lot of cream cheese, beef, and other more accepted ingredients. I've had a lot of $1 sushi in the past so I tried the chicken stir fry with udon noodles. It was good, piping hot and came with a good broth. There wasn't any particular seasoning or teriyaki flavoring. The meal was about $10. Overall, a good experience for a quick lunch for less than $10."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my favorite lady, my sister, around 8pm on a colder Saturday night. No reservation required which I wasn't expecting. We were immediately seated by their fishtank which sounds awful but they have cute little booths for two people that I prefer to tables. It took a waiter a while to come around but she was courteous and checked in with us just enough. They have a small menu outside of sushi so I ordered bul go kee. It's was okay, the sides were spicier than I expected. Overall it was a pleasant night out but I wasn't blown away. Never had average service and food be so spot on."}
{"text":"I will start with the price: EXPENSIVE, Very expensive. Usually when I go to a sushi place, I order the sushi bowl chirashi for the assorted sushi and sushi rice. The plate is small, and the amount is small. There are three people in my party, and what funny is my bowl's tuna is different than those of my friends. They probably ran out of the tuna. And also I don't like my fish to be in small pieces. This place is over priced, and comparing to Sakanaya, this place is just not worth the money you pay for. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We usually enjoy dining here because they have lots of options for me, as I am vegetarian. Our last visit was more than disappointing. The service was good minus a few hiccups. We ordered appetizers (both meatless) and the first bite was filled with meat. I haven't eaten meat is so long I immediately lost my appetite. The next problem was when my food was spilled on me. While this wasn't the servers fault, it just happened. I don't think I'll be coming back here as I have never felt more sick to my stomach as them mistaking my meatless food for something loaded with meat."}
{"text":"Super pretentious, not particularly good service, with food that isn't really that great.  There's typically very little reason for me to consider going to Kofusion, though I have to admit the interior looks really nice!"}
{"text":"I came here today with my mom for a late lunch. It's been several years since I've been here. I enjoyed it last time but I remember it being pretty expensive so I've been visiting cheaper sushi places in the interim. KoFusion today left me pretty disappointed. First of all, our waitress gave a really strong impatient vibe. I got the impression that she was staying late or covering for someone else because there were additional customers she wasn't expecting late in the day. She was pretty slow with refilling my water and was trying to take our menus away right as we ordered a roll of sushi for an appetizer. It was like she was trying to discourage us from ordering more. At the time, my mom knew what she wanted but I wasn't ready yet so, I decided to wait until later. When she came back to check, I asked about the sushi bowl. I've never heard of a sushi bowl before and wanted to make sure I wasn't ordering anything I wouldn't like so I asked the waitress to describe it. Seems like a simple request right? Her response was \"the description in the menu is pretty obvious\". Come on, don't you think I read the description first? Even if I hadn't, isn't it her job to talk about the dishes in the menu from her perspective in more detail than what's on the menu? I was very disappointed with her response. After continuing to talk about what sushi bowls could be from what I read, she did reaffirm my assumptions but it would have been nice to have gotten there without the sarcasm. Also, she completely forgot to take my mom's order. If my mom didn't shout what she wanted as our waitress walked away, we would have had to wait until she returned again later. In the end, the food was delicious. I love the sweet and spicy sauce that the sushi bowl came with and if you like raw fish but want something a little different than regular sushi or when others aren't into sushi and you want something for yourself, I would definitely recommend it. For almost $20, I was a little disappointed to see imitation crab but overall it was a good balance of savory, tart, sweet, and spicy.  With so many other cheaper and friendlier sushi options, I can't imagine that KoFusion will be lasting much longer when these kinds of experiences are what they're offering. Also, I'm pretty sure we walked in right as dollar sushi was starting which I didn't remember until we were on our way out. Why didn't anyone mention the deal? It's almost like they're discouraging you from spending money there!"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly overrated.  It's sooo overpriced and the food is only decent.  The only reason to come here is for the decor I guess?  Also, to give it some credit, they're probably the only place around here with interesting sushi rolls in addition to the usual ones.  Maybe a nice place to bring out-of-town visitors, but not some place I personally like to eat."}
{"text":"I eat here quite frequently and the consistency is uneven at best. I prefer the sashimi salad and sometimes it's better prepared than other times. Today there was about 1/2 as much ingredients as my salad two weeks ago. The fish is probably the ends and not prime like it is at Sakanaya, not an excuse for a salad. Sometimes the sushi rice is warm when it's supposed to be cold. We also like the spicy Korean chicken but that's also inconsistent. Tonight the chicken was clearly overcooked and we didn't get any of the sauce that is usually poured over it. We should go to Sakanaya more often but the parking options aren't as easy."}
{"text":"Screw this place!!  I was there once when the place was practically empty with plenty of servers sitting around and still the service was HORRIBLE.  We were ignored the entire time.  The food sucks too.  They bill themselves as an asian-french fusion cuisine place but that is pure bs.  It's more like crappy sushi or steak/chicken.    It's mostly shitty overpriced sushi made with rice that definitely is not sushi grade and is served very cold (big no no).  If you respect and enjoy sushi then do not eat here.  Also the decor looks like something out of night at the roxbury with stupid club lighting everywhere.  This place is for frat boys to throw daddy's money around in and should be avoid by people who like japanese and french food."}
{"text":"I always get an urge to swerve into ko fusion when I'm on campus. An order of the creamy rolls always satisfies. Good rolls, friendly folk and a very clean place. Going back soon! Ps. Somebody needs to return the sweet bondage pic that was stolen from the men's room wall."}
{"text":"Good food. Great ambiance. Nice for a girls night out or even just a date. Pricing consistent with quality and portions of food. Highly recommend all the sushi ;)"}
{"text":"Great date night! Pork belly tacos are a must! DO NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU TRY THEM...seriously. The sushi was great! Some of the best I've had. Nice atmosphere and good drinks. Recommend going on Thursdays though. Sushi is half off!"}
{"text":"Came here from out of town. My friend said this was the best sushi she has ever had. I have had a lot of sushi all across this nation and I have to say....it was excellent. The server was polite and very prompt with our needs.  If you like sushi I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"One if the best sushi places in champaign. We usually go there every 2 week and it is amazing. They have outside dinning over the summer and the inside ambiance is also perfect."}
{"text":"I'm a SOCAL gal and therefore a bit of a sushi snob, but Kofusion was a nice surprise here in the land of flat.  They certainly don't present their sushi in a way that I'm used to, nor are their offerings in any way comparable to a 'real' sushi restaurant, but that said - I like this place. The servers are great and the $1 sushi Sunday crowd was huge and happy. Happy? I'd say so! You just can't beat being well fed on fish and having an appetizer and a drink for $20.  I looked at their regular sushi menu and was surprised: It is pricy in comparison to SOCAL sushi but I suppose location and limited competition have an impact, so I'll stick to Sundays.   Their Big Roll was a nice surprise and there was enough spicy tuna to keep me happy. Next time I'll pass on their very average deserts and instead opt for MORE sushi!"}
{"text":"I was in a business in Champaign and asked the employee there for a recommendation for Japanese food/sushi.  He said Kofusion, so I looked it up Yelp.  In spite of the assorted poor reviews, I went to Kofusion for dinner anyway, since it was Monday and I read (here) that it's Dollar Sushi on Monday.    It took a few minutes even to get to the hostess, who said there was a long wait (the place was packed), but I could sit at the bar immediately.  She responded in the affirmative when I asked if I could order from the same menu.  So sit at the bar I did.    For the uninitiated, the 'dollar sushi' is per PIECE, not per ROLL.  So, calculate accordingly.  However, these are not your regular old California rolls, or good ole spicy tuna, salmon skin roll, etc.  These are fancier and more intricate rolls, and priced rather low.    Take a look:  http://www.kofusion.com/?page_id=255  I didn't have any idea which would be the best, so I got the sampler (10 pieces, $10).  Actually I got 2 orders :-)  It's a little hard figuring out which piece was which sometimes, but the bartender offered to help me several times, and they left the menu with me, which I thought was a nice touch, so I could cross-reference what I was eating.   The sushi was totally worth it.      Reading the other reviews, the only thing I can surmise is that the bad reviews came from people who had to wait too long, or maybe the staff has been changed recently.  I had no problem with anyone there; the hostess, the two bartenders who served me, and a woman, who may have been the owner(?) who came and very nicely asked me to move one barstool over so she could seat a party of two next to eachother.  Parking is a problem here as with anywhere near the university.  There was a sign on the door saying they validate 2 hour parking for a parking lot, but since I didn't know that, didn't know where the lot was, and had already fed the meter on the street, I didn't think anything of it.  The decor was nice, especially against the backdrop of the other restaurants I had been in since driving around eastern Illinois and western Indiana for the past few days.  Go to Kofusion and get sushi-  you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Chocolate Cake!! 5 stars just for that! Also the Stir Fry was top notch with GF Soy Sauce by request! Thank you for accommodating a GF Gal!!!"}
{"text":"This place has grown dear to me since I developed so many severe allergies this year.  I can't have the sushi anymore so I won't comment on that but I will say this:  1.  Thank you for making my Hwe Du Bop something catered just to me (regular rice, no sauce, no seasoning, no tamago and crab stick, add jalapeño, mix with sesame oil).  Seriously.  Thank you.  2.  You have Chopin vodka which I can drink and is my beverage of choice.  What needs to be improved?  Stay open later.  We would stay longer and order more drinks.  For real."}
{"text":"My only complaint with Kofusion is that it is a little too loud.  The food is all well executed and neatly plated.  I've eaten sushi from Niigata to New York, and while the nigiri clearly isn't as fresh as it could be (being that Kofusion is a thousand miles away from any ocean), I think the maki here is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Good sushi deals.  Great sake. The fish tanks are beautiful And matches the ambiance. Heather is such a cutie. Request her if you go in. Great sense of humor too!"}
{"text":"This place is grossly overpriced and the only day that is worth going is probably sushi night on Mondays. It says that it's $1 sushi but what they didn't tell you is that it's $1 a piece and only limited to 10 selections; AND you have to order the entire 10-piece sampler. Very tricky indeed. On other days, a 8-10-piece sushi roll can be about $8-$15. The ambience is great and this place is definitely wonderful for parties and gatherings. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Five stars for the lunch buffet, and sitting at the sushi bar. Lunch buffet rocks. I'm kinda hinkey about buffets (who sneezed on this shit, ya know.), but this one was so good I almost foundered myself. The angels sang when that curry chicken and spicy apple cucumber salad hit my tongue. The buffet isn't big, but it's definitely a case of quality over quantity. Have sat at the sushi bar a few times, and had good experiences. If the chef likes you, he'll give you little tastes of things. One time he made me a tiny bowl of spicy octopus and seaweed salad that made me consider taking his old ass home with me, it was that good. Can't say anything about the regular service, as I haven't experienced it."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon, on the patio, good company, good sushi, and a great server!  it was perfect.  Thanks Dustin!"}
{"text":"This restaurant always sounded like it would be a great place to impress guests or a date. On my last night in Champaign, I finally decided to go in and give it a try. The room was dark and with an impressive modern feel. The music was not too loud and they had a tv screen with changing background art (like you would see on iTunes but a little better). The other tv had the Bulls game so my eyes often wandered away from my date and to this tv (sorry, sweetie). The server was prompt and provided the specials. I decided to go with the Tuna rolls (the standard which I compare these kinds of restaurants) and the chicken stir-fry. The tuna rolls had the largest diameter of meat that I have seen in C-U and it was of a good quality. My only complaint was the meagerness of the serving but they made up for it with a lot of meat for each roll and the neat stacked arrangement of the rolls. The stir fry I really enjoyed! All of their meat dishes seemed to accommodate those who want free-range and humanely treated livestock. For the price and the hype, I was somewhat satisfied. I still think Sushi Kame is the better place to go for Japanese food and sushi and it is not as crowded and loud. However, if you really want to impress out-of-town guests, you go to Kofusion and not Kame."}
{"text":"Loved the sushi!!! They were really delicious. Got the fusion sushi rolls and the mango/shrimp tempura rolls (forgot the name). The sushi flavors are really different. Definitely loved the fusion roll. It was crunchy, spicy, and filled with flavor! They were also kind of creamy. This place definitely had unique sushi flavors and I would definitely come back. It gets pretty packed on the weekends. Great indoor and outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"Overall decent place,  great decor and service is ok.  Good: Chicago roll is amazing and is the best on the menu in my opinion. Dollar sushi on Mondays are a great way to try things out.   Bad: Miso soup is terrible and the duck was way overdone."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience. the atmosphere was nice, and the cooked food was fine, but there is no excuse for the sushi that they serve. the biggest shame is that they buy high quality fish, but they pre-cut their fish at 4 in the afternoon, destroying the quality. I order sashimi, and specifically asked them to cut it fresh. they actually refused and served me nigiri cut fish on top of shredded radish. it was fishy and terrible they should feel ashamed for ruining what i am sure was expensive hamachi."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!  No better place on Sunday and Monday for $1 Sushi!  Janet, her husband and her staff have always treated us like  family.  Janet is the face of the restaurant and has a fantastic memory as well as a great business mind.  The location is perfect and the design is breath taking.  She  recognizes us when we come in, greets  us warmly and always has a nice word to say.  The food is fresh, portions are ample and taste is delicious.  Our favorites are the specialty roles; maybe a little more expensive but soooo worth it.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"BEST STEAK EVER!  Seriously.  When you think of Ko Fusion, you usually think of dollar sushi night or just sushi in general, but they truly have the absolute best steak I have ever had. I am typically a ribeye kind of person, but their strip is amazing.  The waiter advised that they typically cook it medium well, but I asked for medium rare and it was PERFECT.  I'm also a firm believer that if the steak is cooked and seasoned properly, then there is no need for a sauce of any kind, but their sauce they use truly enhances the steak altogether.  I could eat this every single day.  The sushi is fresh and although it's good, I will probably mainly only ever return for the steak.  I can't get over it.  The décor is awesome too.  Super snazzy and an excellent place altogether.  The outdoor seating is usually the place to be during the warmer months.    A tad pricey, but well worth it for the steak. Promise."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for fresh sushi in Champaign by far! (Don't forget the $1 sushi on Mon nights!) I've had the stir fry, scallops, tofu and lots of other dishes there too and all were pretty delicious and unique. It's a really good restaurant to go to for something different although I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone.  I will say that it's really hard to not enjoy the atmosphere. The soothing neon lights, aquariums, and smooth lines of the sushi bar are pretty marvelous on the eyes. Not only that but the location is perfect because after you're done, there are tons of other bars to go to for an after-dinner drink or two. Overall, its totally worth it!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi that has mayo, cream cheese, and is deep fried, this is your place. I didn't love it. The stir fry tofu was not bad. But overall it's too pricey for the portions, especially the sushi."}
{"text":"I have been going to Kofusion for years. One of my favorite sushi places in central IL. When I was in college the best day to go is during dollar sushi day so you can go try all the different options. Which is also a extremely affordable which is always a plus.   However if you don't go during dollar sushi roll day. Their prices a very reasonably priced and the rolls are well worth the trip when your in the Champaign area. I love all the rolls but my top favorite is Volcano Roll, Chicago Roll and the Big Roll. I highly recommend you try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Too expensive, too long waiting time and food not good enough. There are better places in CU with the same price range and better quality"}
{"text":"I like kofusion, although I mostly like it for the $1 sushi.  ONE DOLLAR SUSHI ON MONDAY NIGHTS!  Don't miss that shit.  The one dollar sushi is as american as it comes (ie fried, filled with cream cheese, and most often not raw) but it is one dollar.  ONE DOLLAR!    I've never eaten off the non-sushi menu, but I have had the sake mojito about a million times.  I did not like it as much as a rum mojito at first; not sweet enough, a little sour for a mojito, but it is quite distinctive and grows on me every time I have it.    The ambience, I believe, is as good as it gets in champaign.  Nice tranquil water fountains and fish tanks and high def tvs with fishtanks and water fountains playing on them.  Service varies.  On one dollar sushi night it (understandably) takes a while for the food to come out, and the politeness of the wait staff during that lengthy interval is not always as high as it might be."}
