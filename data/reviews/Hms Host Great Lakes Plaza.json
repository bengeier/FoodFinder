{"text":"This is a nice oasis along I-80 I won't review the individually shops and restaurants I'll leave that to the others and review this plaza on it's own merit. It has very easy access off the toll road with plenty of parking. The inside is always clean and well maintained. It has a great selection of restaurants to chose from having a Panera and a Starbucks is a plus (please read reviews for this Starbucks). Over-all it's a great place to take a break if you compare it to many rest areas along our interstate system they should be rated a five star maybe next time."}
{"text":"Super clean rest stop on Ohio Turnpike but dysfunctional Burger King.  Ten minutes to get a chicken sandwich that's not fast food."}
{"text":"This rest stop with bathrooms was clean, but the service at the shops could have been better. Restaurants include KFC, Pizza Hut, Panera, Burger King, and Starbucks. They also have an information booth and a souvenir shop. I ate at Panera, where the wait for food was a bit long. My turkey and bacon sandwich tasted fine. My husband ate at Burger King, where two female employees did not care about their jobs. They dropped my husband's burger on the floor and looked to see if he noticed! Only when he let them know that he saw the burger fall on the floor did they make him a new burger. I had finished eating my lunch before he even got his. They had plenty of tables and seating."}
{"text":"Didn't realize this was a truck stop when it came up on Google.  I came anyways.  The seating for the food court was abundant.  Order my food from Panera and it came up way to fast. Went to very my drink from KFC/Pizza Hut Express and there was no one at the register....for about 8 minutes.  I had to yell when I saw someone come from the back to get him to even come to the register.  It was a good 30 minutes before they were to close and I understand wanting to get this done so you can leave on time or early.  But don't hang out in the back.  I did not see anyone at the Burger King for the same time period.  Sat down to eat and I had a janitorial lady come and try to sweep under my table while I was eating.  Not from the other side but right next to me,  she actually swept my feet."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm writing this...but arguably the best Burger King I've tried. The Whopper actually looked like the picture and tasted delicious. I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"On several areas on the web, this exact address and number are listed for Starbucks (one of them being Starbucks.com).  I didn't see it (Starbucks) when I drove to this location, so I gave them a call to ask them if they could clarify their location to me.  They answered the phone as \"HMS\" and asked how they could help me.  I said \"Oh, I'm sorry, is this not the number for Starbucks?\" and the person heaved a huge sigh and slammed the phone down.

Not very helpful.  I have no idea what HMS does (no real clear info on the web).  A simple \"wrong number\" or \"we moved into their old location\" would have sufficed.  Oh, and update your information on the web if you don't want any more Starbucks calls, jackasses."}
{"text":"A great place to stop on the turnpike with many options for food. The gas prices are fixed and higher since regulated by the turnpike. But you are paying for easy access. The bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"If you got it, a truck brought it. Well, if that's the case, you might want to wash it. And then wash your hands, too.

What's up with the truckers? What are they thinking about while they're in the truck driving back and forth? First they 'want' my donuts and then they're all over this place like it's a grubber convention and all I want - and this isn't too much to ask -  is to take a deep-bladder horse piss and get me a gingerbread latte at Starbucks. You'd think I was Holly Strano (during the lean years) the way they're all gutteral and lewd and carrying on. Are they talking about me? Really? About me? I dress regular. I do. I'll bet those bastards were talking about me.

Damn. Deep sorrow.

This place was clean but it smelled like somebody lit some bagels on fire in the backroom. People looking at you. People can be a real drag, you know?

The coffee was yummy and I got it with a big whipped cream too. Hello! It was fantastic once I was back in the Subaru with the doors locked."}
