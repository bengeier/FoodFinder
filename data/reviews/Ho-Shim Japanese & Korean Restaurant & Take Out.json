{"text":"Why, why is there raw cabbage passing as \"salad\" in a Japanese bento??  Anyway...I got the vegetarian bento box and the tofu was really gross.  I love tofu and I have never tasted tofu this bad.  There were some steamed broccoli with no flavour. The tempura was the worst.  The batter was so so thick, and it was mostly potato.  Sigh...you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Ho Shim is a very cozy little place in the Financial District.  It is really a hit & miss since it is located in the basement.  Good quality food for a very modest price in this area, which is unbelievable.  I think they do not believe in inflation, at least over the years they have not inflated their prices.  I usually go to their take out window when I need to grab a quick lunch (less than $10), food is served hot always.  I have been a patron more than 20 years and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"$4 (After tax!!) for ten pieces of (decent!!) salmon maki.   In the financial district.   What the hell?!  Quite unbelievable value.  It wasn't the best sushi ever, but it was good for the price, and  good for boxed, take-out style sushi. My colleague got sushi in Rexall or somewhere and was furious at the quality:value ratio of the sushi I got here in comparison!!  I will definitely be coming back. And back. And back ..."}
{"text":"Ho-Shim is almost one of those secrets that is so good you want to keep it for yourself.   This is a food-court type counter place in the lower level of BMO/First Canadian Place. It is attached to Akco Lounge and acts as Akco's take-away storefront.   First thing about Ho-Shim is that it is cheap! I do not know of a cheaper place to get lunch in the underground. Quantities are good so value for the dollar - high.   Second thing about Ho-Shim is it is fresh! Food comes right out the back to the customers waiting - lines can be a little long, so get there early to get the lunch special.   Great little spot for a quick bite to eat on a budget. I hope it doesn't become so popular they raise the prices!   Recommended for a tasty lunch on the cheap."}
{"text":"The smaller take out place Been 22 years since going there Food was still amazing. Loved it Highly recommend It was the best day in a long time Thank you Ho Shim"}
{"text":"I have learnt to avoid foodcourt sushi at all costs.  Heck, in most of Toronto I've learnt to avoid sushi altogether.  BUT Ho shim is actually good! and cheap! When I passed by this place the small fridge case looks fresh and I took a chance because I saw that they were attached to a resto/catering service so it looks like they can handle food properly. I was incredibly surprised that the food was good and CHEAP. This is definitely going to be on my top 10 list for financial district lunchtime cheap eats."}
{"text":"I work at FCP and come here for lunch often because it's relatively cheap and fast service. Food - 4 stars. But it's brought down to 3 stars because their serving portions vary too much on a day-to-day basis. Most times I visit, I get the Bulgogi lunch and on some days I get decent portions, some days it's sad. They need to work on giving consistent amount of food...  That's all."}
{"text":"Attached to the revamped Akco Lounge (Japanese Cuisine).  Ho Shim take out features a short menu of select take out combos.    Best Value: Teriyaki Chicken combo or Korean Chicken combo comes on a bed of rice along with chap-jae (clear noodles), and cole slaw.  For $6, you get a huge amount of chicken with the other yummies on the side. Also recommended is the Bulgogi combo but I don't eat much beef so I rarely have it. Other favourite is the 'lunch combo' which gets you tempura shrimp and veggies, a few pieces of teriyaki along with chap-jae and coleslaw.  All can be had for a budget friendly sum of $7.   Believe me when i say the portions are huge! The selection of sushi available is also quite good but goes beyond my self imposed $10 limit for lunch."}
{"text":"Ho Shim is my go-to when I want something simple, cheap, and healthy. I usually go for their super tender Korean Chicken on a bed of vegetables (no noodles, no rice, no sauce) which comes to $6 (incl tax) - honestly, you really can't beat this price. Veggies include sliced cabbage, sliced carrots, broccoli.   Last I checked, they're open till 9PM on weekdays which is super helpful for professionals that work late in the area."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot about the fantastic lunch deal from wallet-saavy coworkers, I decided to try it. Special of the day was chicken stir-fry. They all but filled a large container with steamed white rice, slaw and cold sweet noodles and added a single florret of steamed broccoli. A-OK so far!  Then they loaded it with a ton of chicken. A-OK!  Then they charged me $4 even, tax-in. I'M A FAN!   Then I tasted it. Ennh...   The noodles were tasty but oily and cold, which I found odd mixed up with the hot rice. The slaw was good. The chicken stir fry was not stir fry at all but a stew of chicken, potatoes and carrots. It was all rubbery dark meat and there was a small bone in one piece. Maybe if I liked stew I would have enjoyed this, but I don't. So I didn't.   That said, I paid $4--ON THE PATH-- for a giant container bursting with food. Also to take into consideration, this appears to be a mom and pop shop--ON THE PATH. For that, A-OK."}
{"text":"Tried their bulgogi lunch combo for $6! Great value for what it was. I was handed a big take out box full of rice, japchae (my favourite noodle dish), and really crunchy coleslaw with a nice tangy vinegar flavour (I didn't expect to like it so much). And of course a huge heaping spoonful of bulgogi beef. The beef itself isn't the greatest quality, I bit into a couple tendon-y parts, but it was marinated nicely and, for the price, it was a solid lunch."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place when I found out that I could get a Bento box here. I do not care much for the sushi, as I'd much rather go to Sushi Shop for that. The menu also reveals that they do udon noodle soups, certainly a welcome addition to the mundane fast-food options in the area.  My colleague ordered one of the daily specials. It was a loaded styrofoam box alright -- packed with a massive clump of coleslaw, a generous bed of rice, some fried chicken on top, other random veggies, and some glass noodles (japchae). I opted for the vegetarian bento box, which came again with a bed of rice. A brick of soft tofu along with some teriyaki sauce sat on top of the rice. A small serving of japchae, bean sprouts, and some other unmemorable veggies were littered around the side of the box. And then there was a generous serving of vegetable tempura.  Unfortunately, neither of us enjoyed our meals, as excited as we were to try this place out. My colleague did not find the massive clump of coleslaw appetizing. The amount of rice was simply unnecessary. The fried chicken, albeit somewhat tasty, was cold and dry. The only highlight of her meal was the glass noodles.  My experience was similar. The brick of tofu dropped onto the rice was the most uninspired tofu I'd ever had. It was literally just a large brick, not sliced or anything, probably carved right out of the packaging and dropped onto the rice. I don't even know if it was cooked. It was as cool as the chilled tofu you'd order at Japanese restaurants, but it wasn't cut in the same way to be enjoyable -- it measured some 2\"x2\" and 1\" tall (literally a brick!). The teriyaki/soy sauce did little to add flavour to the tofu. I could not finish it. The rice was enjoyable because of the teriyaku sauce however. The vegetable tempura was cold and had gotten somewhat soggy. Despite this, it was probably one of the more enjoyable parts of the meal. And the rest of the haphazard veggie sides were redeemed only by the generous amount of tempura sauce that was given to me. However, the bean sprouts were a welcome addition, as were the glass noodles.  I am disappointed. I would have liked to come by and check out the udon offerings, but I am rather skeptical of this place now. While the serving sizes are generous for the price paid, the boxes are just loaded with cheap negligible items (like rice and/or coleslaw)."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and they offer a large menu. They have today specials too and they were so cheap!! Sadly they got sold out before I could devour them.  I got the bulgogi instead and was surprised to find myself carrying a rock. I swear it was so heavy, they really know how to pack it.  After trying a few times. Its cheap, but no good."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Owned by Koreans, they are located in the basement of First Canadian Place. I am a regular here since it's close to my workplace. I believe this place only opens for weekdays, since it goes by Financial District work schedule.  Note that this place is takeout only, if you want to look for a place to sit down and eat, I usually go to the seats in the PATH leading to St. Andrew stn.   What is attractive is the prices. There are usually 2 specials that are only $4 and $5 respectfully, and they fill up a takeout box with rice, chicken, glass noodles, and veggies (pick from carrots, broccoli, bean sprouts, egg, and coleslaw). These specials run out quickly though, so try to get there around 1230pm and they will usually have it.   They accept CC but not debit. Even if you don't get the specials, most meals are 6 or 7 dollars. And the convenient thing is that they ensure that all the prices are calculated so that adding tax gives whole number values. i.e. $4.42 meal, with tax is $5 flat. Because of this, the large lineup clears up very quickly. The staff are very friendly, and you get to know them pretty well.   I regularly get their bulgogi and korean chicken, both are great and quite fresh.   If you're looking for a cheap, good quality lunch, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Amazing price for a great portions.   Recommendation: Since it is located in the financial district, the path and food court does get really really really packed and busy. There is a lot of seating if you go to the very top of the First Canadian Place.   I work at the Eaton Centre, but the price is so good that it was worth the walk through the path to get to Ho-Shim. This place was recommended by my co-worker because of the great price and portion size. This was my second time coming to this place, however, this time I ordered the Fried chicken combo, which came with a bed of rice, coleslaw, japchae (glass noodles) and fried chicken. The fried chicken was cold, but still tasted very good.   All in all, for a cheap price and portion size, I would definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"If you are in the banking district and aimlessly looking for acceptable and palatable fare, try this place.  Not brilliantly incredible but acceptable compared to all the other vile stuff available in the concourse of First Canadian Place.  I generally order the vegetarian bentoh or the pre-prepared maki rolls.  They are not overly generous with the kimchi so you have to ask for more.  The man at the cash desk is a bit grumpy but I joke around with him in Hangul-mal and he perks up and cracks a smile.  This place is a much better alternative to the other stuff around there and is quite satisfying."}
{"text":"This place has it's loyal followers and a few of my officemates eat here almost daily.  This little over the counter Korean take out is down in the basement of the First Canadian Place and in the heart of the Bay St banker territory.  People say this is almost a hidden secret but I think otherwise.  When noon time hits, there is a HUGE line up for this place.  It can easily get up towards 15++ people in line but since everything is pre-cooked and it's just plopped into a container, the line moves really fast.  One thing I learned about Bay St. lunch time eating is that it's polarized.  Either you're paying for luxury and amazing food on someone's account a la Canoe or it's fast and not that great often.  Sure there are a few places that are a happy medium but they're few and far between.  Most places at King and Bay are the underground food courts.  This one is probably the most popular Korean one I've found to date.  The food is usual Korean Asian fusion fare.  Bulgogi, stir fried meats with vegetable, and teriyakis are their common staples.  You'll find they have daily specials where you'll get a ridiculously enormous portion of rice with your choice of stir fried/stewed veggies and meat.  The special is priced at... $4.  No joke.  It's such a great value... but not a great deal.  It would be amazing deal if it tasted really great as well.  Sadly the tastes of most of these are a bit bland but I'm not sure if it's cause they under season or because the meals sit in these water baths to keep warm and the steam just collects in these.  Veggies are often too soft but I believe it's from sitting in these trays for too long.    Overall, you really cannot find a better value in the Bay St area for Asian food.  You're never left hungry or disappointed by how affordable it is.  For Bay st. prices, it's fantastic... but to compare this to more Korea town restaurants, the flavour doesn't hold up."}
{"text":"Great pricing for the amount of food.   I got in at 2PM and completely missed the lunch special. Alternatively went for the Tempura & Chicken with Rice, it came to about $4.60~. It came with a slaw, rice and a few pieces of veggies. The Chicken was fantastic! The Tempura was... the coldest I've ever devoured Tempura to be.  Be sure to come early during the lunch hour to ensure the freshest-fried Tempura, or, the freshest cooked-anything!"}
