{"text":"Love love love..this place.. I try to eat here 2 times a week.. The jimmy buffet salad and mushroom soup are to die for.."}
{"text":"Man this place is amazing. If you are into wimpy little sandwiches that are precut stick with subway. Even peoples complaints about this place make me want to eat it more. Who doesn't want a sloppy sandwich?  The service is great and the hot sandwiches are worth the drive!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are creative, fresh and tasty ... sometimes a bit juicy for elegant eating, but hey, most of the time the place is full of students, and students don't take time for elegance, no?  The free cookie is nice, the \"no refills\" soda policy is not.  Prices are fair.   But the place is LOUD.  Uncomfortably so.  It's not the music, or even the conversation level ... it's that there is not one soft surface in the place, and sound amplifies as it bounces off glossy walls, counters, tables and floors.  It's designed that way, and lord knows why.  The sandwiches and salads make up for it, though."}
{"text":"Almost walked out because the line was out the door. But instead, we were begged to stay, and our order was taken immediately.  Feel bad about being jumped in front of others, however, I had never been hard-sold to stay at a restaurant before. And it was amazing!  Additionally, I ordered the gothic, and it too was amazing. Would recommend to my friends!"}
{"text":"Sacks: YUM-O  I love your sandwiches!  You remind me of a place in Tucson, Baggins which I also love!  The staff at Sacks is super friendly and efficient.  The restaurant is ALWAYS clean as are the restrooms - big plus in my book.  Possibly my favorite thing about Sacks is that they are super accommodating about making changes to your order.  I like to use menus as a starting point to craft my perfect meal.  I hate when people get snooty and make sure that you know they think you are being difficult.  You will find no such people at Sacks - and they get my order perfect every time!  Go Sacks!!!  The \"Sacks Symphony\" is delightful.  They also have this sandwich that takes everything you like about Thanksgiving and puts it on a sandwich, if you haven't been brave enough to try it, please do, you won't regret it.    My only complaint is that the have a $20 dollar minimum for delivery and they moved and are almost too far for me to go for lunch during the week.  However, I think I love them enough to go the extra mile.  5 stars to you Sacks, you rock"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch! They have quality sandwiches and daily specials that are always tasty. I love the location but the parking can be a bit tight during peak lunch times."}
{"text":"This is the one shop that comes to my mind when I want a sandwich. Quite possibly my favorite lunch...the Jazz, Poor Brothers Jalapeno chips, a cute little chocolate chip cookie, and a Mr. Pibb. In fact, I had that today! Awesome."}
{"text":"Unimpressed and disappointed. There is nothing to these sandwiches. There are so many other places to get better sandwiches. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great place to get a sandwich. Oh, and did I mention the cookie?"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this past Saturday. I was craving a Ruben - random I know. But it really hit the spot (although a little much on the slaw).  Just $6 for a big sandwich (I was full well into the evening) and a surprise cookie! I will definitely be back to try out some of the other choices or create my own.  Oh, and if you have the same initials they put on the chalkboard that day - you get a free sandwich! My lunch date had the opposite of what was posted (D.S. instead of S.D) and the cashier gave us both free drinks. Super cool."}
{"text":"Superb Sandwichery and Unserpassable Consistency  If you're anywhere nearby this centrally-located, family-owned and operated sandwich and salad locale it is the ONLY choice for the best lunch in Arcadia. I have been ordering the Symphony (sans mayo - just a personal choice) toasted, with extra sprouts for probably 6 years. Their Grilled Cajun Chicken salad is what I ordered when I tried to go carb-less, with Spinach instead of lettuce, and tomato dressing and if a salad can fulfill my carb craving, I have to say it is of the best quality :). A staple of Arcadia, and very well run. Consistency is of the UTMOST importance, and Sacks has been making my favorite sandwich since I was in girl scouts over 20 years ago! A must visit!!!"}
{"text":"It stinks cause this place has a pretty good menu but they keep cutting corners so we are done going here.  My husband likes their hot sandwiches but the last two times we've ordered there has been so little meat on them its unreal.  Its basically eating bread with dressing.  We often order to-go and i usually get the tuna salad salad with an extra side of dressing which they charge a dollar for.  I would say almost half the time my dressing is forgotten.  Today i stopped in and ordered a salad and i still got charged that buck for an extra dressing even though they probably owe me about 10 of them.  $11 something for a salad with tuna on top and a soda - its not worth that much.  we like their menu but whatever cost cutting they have taken in the last year doesnt work."}
{"text":"They don't call it the \"Art of Sandwiches\" for nothing.   These masterfully crafted sandwiches bring the perfection of the Mona Lisa combine it with the meticulousness of Georges Seurat's \"Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" and leave you with a breathtaking masterpiece of Michelangelo.   Recommendation: anything. The hot special everyday just keeps you coming back. It's like the lottery except you win every time. The O'Keefe is a delicious mainstay though! Chicken, mushrooms, cheese, lettuce, avocado. I'm smiling at the thought of the joy that it brought my tastebuds.   If you didn't think that sandwiches could be art, go to Sack's. It will change you in the best way.   Extra: they give you a cookie with every sandwich. Not like a normal cookie. Like a chocolate chip cookie that has been cooked by Jesus. It's heavenly."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches and the cookies are amazing. The staff is very friendly and they make the sandwiches quickly. The one thing I don't like is the tables are always dirty so I wander around to find the least dirty one to sit at. Also some of the tables and chairs are wobbly and they have tried to MacGyver some things to level them out. These two things are easy fixes to make so when they do I will rate them higher since their food and service are excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm still in disbelief that Sacks doesn't have *at least* four stars.  I discovered Sacks a couple of months ago. I've never been the type of person who could get excited over a sandwich-- sandwiches are boring, right?   Well, Sacks has single-handedly turned me into a sandwich lover. It started with the Mona, and then it was the Encore, and then the Van Gogh; each sandwich as artfully crafted as the original masterpiece or artist.   I order all my sandwiches on multi-grain-- which is amazing, and I would highly recommend it. And then I devour that wonderful cookie!  The service is quick, the ambiance is perfect for lunch for busy Arcadians, and you just can't beat the location."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan.  Fast, well made sandwiches at a darn good price.  They have a wide assortment of sammies already on the menu, OR you can just make your own.  The first time I went I had the special of the day.  It was a crazy assortment of grilled chicken, grilled artichoke hearts, spinach, pesto and cheese (havarti, I think) on grilled tomato basil bread.  Don't get me wrong, it was very good, just not my style.  I went back the next week so I could place a custom order in an attempt to mimic the end-all-be-all of sammies from my old (now closed) sandwich haunt that they called the Entrepreneur.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!  And only $5.18.  So good in fact that I didn't eat the cookie because I didn't want to spoil the taste in my mouth.  Here's how it goes: Grilled turkey, grilled ham, and bacon on grilled sourdough with lettuce, tomato and mayo.    There is something special about this combination of flavors.  Get one.  I dare ya."}
{"text":"Huh, I haven't reviewed Sacks.  Lets fix that!  I am in Sacks fairly often, they have fresh, reliably tasty eats,  I would be in there more often if they were opened in the evenings.  I nearly always eat whatever is on special and have also tried several of their regular menu selection although I have not made my own as yet.  I like that they seem to think about how the sandwich is constructed physically as well as flavor counterpoints.  I have never had a sandwich fall apart in my hands here or thought something was too bland.  I appreciate the inhouse made side options the rotini salad being my go-to.  I'd love to taste their version of a German style potato salad.  If you go for their combo deal they put a baby cookie on your plate.  Its a pretty good cookie that makes you wish it was a big one.  This is probably how they sell their take home cookie dough.  They don't get the fifth star for two reasons.  One, the two different combo options are not explained on their menu board.  Considering it is an upsell for them they must perform routinely through out the day it should be clearly posted.  Second, the high ceiling and sealed concrete floor can make it difficult to have a conversation in there when they are busy unless you are lucky enough to get a seat in the alcove.  They need some wall hangings in the rafters or sommat."}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch with a group of 6; Good thing we got here early as this place had lines almost out the door when we left.  I got a simple grilled cheese sandwich. It was pretty perfectly cooked.    Very reasonable pricing! We'll be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience.  Two thumbs down.  I have only heard good things about how great this place is. HA!  Our office ordered about 20 sandwiches from them.  The hot sandwiches were luke warm.  The chip order was not delivered. The drink order apparently was forgotten as well.  An $8 Ceasar salad that you would think would fill the container was so small it would fit in a small bowl.  Not recommended.  We will never order from there again and we have 350 people in our office."}
{"text":"Get the encore sandwich!! Make sure to get it with the yogurt sauce!!  AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their sandwiches are amazing but I'm personally a fan of their salad specials. They come up with the most interesting combinations for salads, and are always super tasty. All meals come paired with a cookie which is great.   The service is great and so is the atmosphere. I definitely recommend this place for a lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place but their hours on yelp is wrong. They close at 3 but yelp says 4pm, they need to look into that and get it fixed."}
{"text":"We order this for the office a couple of times a month. They deliver with a $20 minimum & $5 fee. I go get a few things like the Sacks Improv, Sacks Dali, and Sacks Symphony. My bosses usually get the Cajun Chicken Caesar Salad. Nobody has ever complained about anything they have gotten there."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I loved it everytime. It's light, fresh and packed with flavor. I really enjoy their sandwiches and the pasta isn't half bad except the oriental noodles that was just way too salty. But other than that, very tasty stuff. They have a large variety of sandwiches with quirky little names. Oh and they throw in a cookie! Give it a try I'm sure you will enjoy it and want to go back for more."}
{"text":"Meh..not particularly memorable. I've eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving.  The cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass.   Warning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother.  I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall.   Go to Opa Grill next door instead."}
{"text":"When you find a well-priced deli with great sandwiches, you don't forget it.  Sacks is definitely one of those places!  I just had the Sack's Symphony and thought it was great, especially for only $5.99, which includes a free cookie!  They've got a decent amount of room to sit down, but I usually take my lunch to go because the tables fill up quickly around the lunch rush.  If you haven't already, try Sacks the next time you're craving a well-made sandwich!"}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches at this place. They have the best ingredients and so many options. The sandwiches do make quite a mess but it's because they are jam packed with goodness; the bread can't contain all the condiments they stuff in there.   It does have horrible art on the walls and gets really crowded at lunch, but I've sat outside and had pleasant meals (usually I just take it home).   If you like BLT's with avocado you MUST try the Jazz it is delightful!"}
{"text":"This place is just what I've been looking for in AZ- an amazing sandwich place!  I went to sacks for the first time yesterday and LOVED IT.  I built my own sandwich which is always a plus.  Im too picky to order sandwichs that are off the menu.  Huge sandwichs for a very reasonable price.  My sandwich was only 6 something.  I wouldve paid 10.  (Sacks, Please dont up your price because I said that)!  I will be frequenting here a lot more for lunch.  Plus the business man candy during the lunch hour is great too.  yaaaa buddy"}
{"text":"My sandwich (design your own, aka \"Self Portrait\") was okay but pretty over-priced for what it was, which was very average.  Pedestrian even.  Pasta salad was not to my liking, and what is up with charging .49 for a skinny little pickle spear?  Really?  (turkey sandwich, small pasta salad side, pickle, drink, $13.50)  If you haven't been before and don't know the drill, you run the risk of having your food thrown up with all the \"call ahead\" orders and then you sit there for 25 minutes because it's busy and you think that's how long it takes, only to find that your sandwich is now soggy and the gallon of oil from your pasta salad has seeped out and soaked everything in the bag, including your skinny little .49 pickle spear.    Yes, I admit it is Monday but I think even if it was Friday, this wasn't more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"New Location @ 4247 E Indian School! is open!!   Same great Sacks new location!  New space is bright a cool art and lots of parking!  I am a big fan of the Improv what can be better then Thanksgiving on a baguette.  And who is not a fan the a included cookie. ;-)"}
{"text":"The Sacks Symphony is one of my favorite sandwiches E.V.E.R. If you LOVE cream cheese like me, this sandwich is for you!! It is packed with turkey, avocado, tomato, bacon, sprouts, cream cheese and mayo on 12 grain bread. I have been going to Sacks with my family since I was a little girl and literally ate it AT LEAST once a week when I was in high school. Another one of my favorites is their Mixed Chicken Salad with balsamic dressing. It is FABULOUS! I always recommend Sacks to anyone who is in the neighborhood and looking for a great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in Europe, if there is one thing I truly miss is high quality sandwiches. Nothing wrong with Subways, but the quality of the bread, despite being made several times a day seems to be very cardboardish. Sack's was close to were I worked and has so far been my favorite sandwich place in Phoenix. Always a but crowded and busy, maybe noisy for some but I'd rather be in a place that feels busy and alive than the only one eating my sandwich. My  favorties are the Improv and the Gothic (warm sandwich). All sandwiches comes with a little cookies which is always pleasant I find. Only negative and I'll admit to ignoring the suggestion is that there is a sign by the owners that ask those who have \"regular\" sized cups to not refill. Not very customer friendly I think. But, and I ask the manager/owner from time to time I really do wish they would open one up in Scottsdale. Prices are probably a bit high, it comes with the neighborhood but I do think the quality of the sandwiches make up for it."}
{"text":"I like this place. Only like. Would love but can't since the bread is terrible. Plus, the front counter guy is totally rude. I didn't come for two years after my last visit because of him and now I'm back. To my horror, the nine grain bread is now bad quality ground wheat and that guy is still there, rude as ever and closing an hour early. Apparently I didn't get the memo because I showed up at 2:50, website says they close at 4. Sorry to disturb you so close to closing time!! Seriously, I can't go back given how awkward this dude is."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sacks for close to 18 years. Always a great sandwich! My favorite is the symphony! Clean am friendly too.. love the new location."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with some co-workers. The location is good, the facilities are clean, the prices were decent and the food was excellent. I had a Chicken Salad which was great, I will try a sandwich next time."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Sacks fairly often at their old location, and this is the first time I have tried it since it moved just 6 blocks away.  I am kicking myself for waiting so long.    I had the reuben sandwich, and it was absolutely delicious.  My wife asked for a little bite of my sandwich, and you could tell that she wanted to ditch her vegetarian sandwich and devour mine.  Fortunately, she limited herself to two bites.  I was so thrilled with my Sack's reuben sandwich that I was craving another sandwich the following day.   I was on the other side of town, and I just opted for a grocery store ready-made sandwich (which was just about the same price as my reuben).  It was a jolt of reality.  I knew how good a sandwich could be because I just ate at Sacks, and I found out how disgusting a sandwich can be by sampling a deli sandwich made at a popular local grocery store.  Apparently, making the perfect sandwich really is an art (as the name of the restaurant implies), and their sandwich makers use bread, condiments, and toppings to create a masterpiece.  If my Sack's sandwich wasn't so delicious, I would frame it and display it proudly.  I took my sandwich to go.  I can't really comment on the tables, the atmosphere, or anything about the location because I wasn't really paying attention.  The sandwich, however, got my full attention and I can't wait to sample another one of their tasty selections."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town. Fresh baked bread and delish cookies! Great atmosphere and nice servers :)"}
{"text":"It has been a while since i visit. I remembered it much better :(  The grilled cheese sandwich i got fir my son was inedible . My turkey sandwich was the equivalent of a subway sandwich for more money. It's okay... but not what i wanted from a cute sandwich shop. Bummer."}
{"text":"Sacks is home to my favorite sandwich in Phoenix! The Sacks Symphony is a turkey sandwich with bacon, avocado, tomato, sprouts, cream cheese and mayo all stacked on 12-grain bread. The ingredients are always fresh and the quality of the lunch meat can't be beat.  Plus, every meal comes with a surprise cookie in the bag.  No one does sandwiches like Sacks!"}
{"text":"Hey! Do you love Sacks as much as I do? Let's go have some Hot Sacks.  Want to come with me?  Go have some Sacks in the city?  Sorry.  I couldn't resist.  I also heard a little while back that the Phx location is Dirty Sacks!  Frankly,  it's given me a chance to shout \"Who wants dirty Sacks?\" at work so many times, I don't really care - but this was like a year ago, so hopefully they've gotten a little squeakier!  Honestly, though, I've never seen anything I'd think was really gross around there, or had anything wrong with my sandwiches.  My love of veggie sandwiches prevails, and so I must give props to Sacks for their Impressionist sandwich - got to love a fresh tasting sandwich (cream cheese, lettuce, cucumber,  tomato, carrot, avocado, red onion, sprouts) with your  choice of 2 kinds of cheeses (in addition to the cream cheese, oh yes)!  On the meaty side of things, I have thoroughly enjoyed a few different kinds, but I really like the Art Deco (salami, ham, provolone cheese, marinated bell pepper, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperocini, & italian dressing), or to change it up, the O'Keefe on the rare rainy day (it's a  sandwich of soft chunks of chicken, sauteed mushrooms, swiss cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, honey mustard).  I totally appreciate that they have different kinds of bread ( I like the grilled onion dill bread or sun dried tomato basil bread!) & with your sandwich, you always get a delicious chocolate chip cookie!  You can buy the batter to make your own cookies from the eatery too, which is pretty cool.  I've only tried the pasta salad out of the sides, but I dug it - it's a nice little addition to the meal - definitely am interested in trying some of the other sides or soups!  My favorite thing to do, though, now that I've tried a few things on the menu, is to just go in randomly and see what the daily specials are & pick a sandwich off of that sideboard.  Jeez... I got a sandwich there once, I'm watering at the mouth a little just remembering it.  I think it was called the Michaelangelo (for good reason - oh, and are you seeing a naming trend?  Get it?... *art* of sandwicherie, hurr hurr) - it was on grilled onion dill bread, had chicken, black forest ham, grilled mushrooms & artichoke hearts, melty havarti cheese, fresh spinach, tomato, olives, & I do believe some kind of saucy condiment (what was it?! ahhh!)  Anyway, if this sandwich was available on a regularly scheduled basis, I would be there every time.  Phew, I need a minute to recover from writing that description. Let's see. The staff has always been pleasant to me, and the food is reasonably priced.  I only wish it were open later, or on Sunday as well!  Oh well. Sunday is a day of rest.  I guess I shouldn't  be having Sacks then anyway."}
{"text":"Sacks Art of Sandwicherie is a mix of southwest, Mexican and modern decor. The salad was rather basic, and the acoustics rather loud. The restroom is really cute but could use seat covers and sweep & mop. If your initials match the predetermined ones on the chalkboard near the front door your sandwiches free. Just don't bother joking with the staff about their own chalkboard. They'll have no idea what you're talking about nor the sense of humor, should you jokingly mention it your initials are posted."}
{"text":"A sandwich that is good enough to satisfy you but not quite memorable enough to earn your consistent patronage.    I do appreciate their naming conventions, as it reminds me of all of those peaceful afternoons spent sleeping during my Art History class."}
{"text":"Fun. Unique. Tasty.  I stopped in after driving by a couple of times for a job that was just around the corner, and I am most certainly glad I did.    The name stuck in my head right off, I thought the \"art of Sandwicherie\" was pretty catchy, and when I walked in and saw that they literally use the paper sack that they deliver your food in to take your order, it just perfectly completed the picture for me; I was sold.  The menu was pretty awesome, as they write all of their items out on a giant chalkboard, and the versatility with that is great.  After poring over the menu for a minute and checking out all the delicious looking options, I asked the lady if there was anything she would specifically recommend, and she told me  I had to try the 'Sacks Encore' with Feta Yoghurt Dressing, and I added mixed mild and hot peppers.    I would have to rate this sandwich in the top 3 best sandwiches I have ever tasted.  I was just a little concerned with the Feta Yoghurt at first, but as soon as I bit in, all of my fears dissipated into thin air, as I was left with an impressively juicy mouthful of creamy melt-in-your-mouth steak with the perfect layering of provolone cheese, and I couldn't help but silently question God's decision not to birth me into a Greek family.  My first experience here has definitely not been my last, I have since brought my wife and my sister here, and told many others to try them out.    5/5 Stars for this place, and they deserve no less!"}
{"text":"I love Sacks and will go out of my way for lunch here!   Every time I eat at Sacks, I order something different. Sometimes it's a regular from the main menu, and sometimes it's one of their creative daily specials. I've never been disappointed. Fresh ingredients and fantastic flavor, created and served quickly by their super friendly staff in a casual cool ambiance."}
{"text":"We go for the salads a-lot. The chicken and tuna salads are great. Simple and hearty. They always give you plenty to eat and the greens are always fresh. Sannies are good too. Not quite the same as the Duck & Decanter, but still better than most."}
{"text":"I normally adore this place. 98% of the time I get the impressionist and it's delicious. Last time it was not good at all. I asked for no onions and it obviously was made with them and then taken off. The entire sandwich tasted like onions... And I hate onions. Ended up throwing the sandwich away which was very disappointing. I gave feedback via the website and never heard back. Sad to see the quality and customer service going down."}
{"text":"Reopened today (3/4/2011)! That in and of itself is worth 5 Stars!  New location is on Indian School, west of 44th St, on the south side of the road."}
{"text":"We went to lunch here for the first time after passing by it 100s of times, we went on a tuesday afternoon at 12:30, it was busy but not too crowded.   This place is NOT vegan friendly in the least, all of the sandwiches have some sort of dairy in them as do the soups. You can make your own sandwiches but I can make a sandwich with cold veggies or sauteed veggies with mustard at home. I would suggest offering grilled zucchini/eggplant with a sauce that is dairy free.   All of the sandwiches are placed in sacks with plastic utensils and styrofoam cups, even if you eat in. This is not eco friendly, my pasta with marinara (which I can make at home) came in a nice plastic to-go container. While I realize this is not a restaurant per say, it would be nice if they had real forks/knives and plates if you plan to eat in and get something more ecofriendly than styrofoam.   I did ask if they recycled before we left, and was told that the kitchen does, which is great! However, there is not a recycling container in the restaurant for the sacks/utensils or pasta to-go packages.   I will not be returning to this non vegan friendly, non planet friendly sandwich shop and would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I can't speak for all of the locations for Sacks, but the location on Indian School is my favorite sandwhich shop in the entire country. When we visit Phoenix our trip is not complete unless we have been more than once. My wife loves the salads, especially the curry chicken salad. I love almost any of the sandwhiches. Some of my favorites include the Encore, Symphony, and Overture."}
{"text":"I have really mixed emotions about Sack's.   On one hand, the baguette bread is soft and chewy; the sandwiches are creative (my coworkers both really like the Jazz and the Gothic); if you don't see a sandwich on the menu you want you can create your own; they use spicy brown mustard (yummy!); the caesar salad is good; service is quick; and you get a cookie with all sandwiches and salad.  On the other hand, it gets really crowded if you don't get there by 11:30 am or arrive after 12:45 pm; the parking lot is super small, so you typically have to park at First Watch; there is a sign that drink refills are for the large size only (I have ignored that sign as I find it ridiculous that they could actually monitor who refills and doesn't); it gets very very noisy so it is hard to hear the people sitting at your own table; and I think the price is a bit high for a sandwich shop (about $9 for an 8 inch sandwich, chips and a regular soda which apparently I can't refill).  Sacks is nice occasionally, but I hate to admit, when I am really craving a sandwich or sub, I usually run to Subway where I can get a meal for almost half the price of Sacks."}
{"text":"Like so many other restaurants in the downtown Phoenix area, Sacks is overpriced for what it is and if you are expecting the quality of \"Sachs,\" the department store, you will be disappointed.   The \"sandwicherie\" title means they are serving sandwiches and not subs. Kind of like what you'd make at home on bread.   I'm not sure it's done  any better here than at Subway or Blimpie. To me, the deli at the Safeway up the road has more exotic sandwich toppings than Sacks (including two different kinds of guacamole).  Like so many places in AZ, every sandwich offered has some kind of cheese on it. It's like it gives the restaurant a reason to throw another buck or two onto the price.   Additionally, Sacks has numerous flies in the summertime. Covering your food is a requirement before going to the restroom, though most of them hang out on the windows.   I've been to Sacks during the busy lunch rush and I've been there when there were more flies than patrons.   The one bright spot is their homemade desert cookies and bars. For some reason they are served cold, which takes some of the freshness away. Exotic flavors of iced tea like mango and pineapple green are a plus too, but by all means not the best unsweetened teas around."}
{"text":"I don't get this place..I seriously think I could go to the store, get the same type of ingredients and make a similar sandwich for less money. I know there are lots of different sandwiches here that you can try. I suppose I prefer a place that has a select few sandwiches that are really good opposed to a lot of choices with ok flavor.  The bread is seriously the cheap kind you can get at the store. It comes with a cookie which doesn't taste like anything special. Lots of people like it here and I can't say anything really...negative happened. I just won't be back."}
{"text":"Looking for a casual lunch spot with moderate prices and a large selection of sandwiches, salads, drinks, etc...? Look no further than Sacks.  Not only do they deliver on the attributes I mention above, but they also deliver literally (with a minimum $25 order and they charge just a gratuity that goes to the driver).  I used to frequent this Sacks when they were located at 48th St and Indian School, and just recently remembered that they relocated just down the street at 42nd and Indian School.  I've been several times in the last few weeks and have been a satisfied customer for sure.    I usually go for their Cobb Salad (no onion and add avocado) with balsamic dressing.  I love that Sacks is fine with modifications to their menu items!  I'm also a fan of their egg salad, the Sacks Symphony Sandwich, and the Sacks Impressionist Sandwich.  I love that they have Snapple drinks and lots of iced tea fountain options as well as Sun Chips!  Their cookies (they come with every meal) are another nice perk if you're not watching your sweet intake!  I must say, I do miss the crackers that they used to serve with the salads awhile back.  Perhaps they will bring those back sometime soon?!  I have yet to take advantage of the delivery service mentioned above, but I do plan on using that in the future when I can't get away to pick up or eat there.  Glad to have yet another reliable lunch option in the hood!"}
{"text":"I personally am not a big fan of sandwiches. And when I go out to eat I usually want to get something I can't or won't make for myself at home. You won't catch me picking up lunch at Subway or most sub shops. However, I love Sacks! I love the fact that the have at least 20+ unique combinations (or you can make your own) and that every sandwich comes with freshly baked chocolate chip cookie! It's just delightful! My favorite combination is the turkey sandwich with cheese, sprouts and stuffing! Probably defeats the healthy factor of ordering a turkey sandwich in the first place but well worth it! They also have a great Thai noodles salad side (just $1). They are fast and efficient but super popular. So be warned if you are in a hurry call ahead and place your order."}
{"text":"Freakin love this place!!!! I can eat here everyday for the rest of my life and get the same feeling of it being my first time every time! Sandwiches are absolutely delicious and you can see and taste the quality in their products! I'm from NYC and when I find something good in Phoenix I get very excited!"}
{"text":"I refuse to eat at a restaurant where you stole 98% of your menu from another restaurant and just changed the names!  Shame.  Wish I could give zero stars"}
{"text":"Sacks fills an obvious void we Phoenicians have to deal with. The lack of high quality, creative yet reasonably priced sandwiches in a casual atmosphere is blatant to any transplants, especially former Californians.   While I was living in California, I came to learn that there were a handful of good sandwich spots around that provided an excellent alternative to fast or cafeteria food. Back in AZ, there isn't much, but I'm finding places like Sacks, DeFalco's, and even Cheba Hut are taking us there. Just in a slow, more spread out kind of way."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sacks for 10 years.  I typically go at least once per week.  The quality of the food has gone down hill in the past year and the customer service is marginal at best.  I really want to give 4+ stars, but recently I have encountered too many negative experiences.  I truly hope they turn around the quality of the food and their customer experience."}
{"text":"As I've said previously, I love Sacks and their sandwiches. Compared to the downtown version, this location is nice. The parking is a little confusing, since it is shared with another restaurant, but at least there is plenty of parking! Both outside and inside are pretty cool. I've always called ahead and had my order ready and waiting to be devoured. For such a delicious sandwich, the price is great. My fav is the Symphony - turkey, avocado, and bacon on wheat. Perfection. The employees are really nice as well. I like that I can get in and out quickly at this location (compared to the downtown location). I just wish there was a Sack's closer to home!"}
{"text":"I was in town from LA shooting over at Arizona Virtual Studios, and needed a place to grab an easy, affordable, and somewhat healthful meal for my crew. I've been burned many times by picking a local eatery to pick up lunch. Still, I rolled the dice and was more than happy with our meal. Ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Our large order was ready in only fifteen minutes. Big thumbs up to Sack's, and I'll be using them when I'm back in town at this location."}
{"text":"You get a delicious chocolate chip cookie with your meal. Other than that, nothing stood out outstandingly. Sandwiches are good. Salads are decent. Soups are tasty (when they aren't sold out of the one you want).  And once, I wanted chicken noodle, but they were out of noodles that day. Why didn't they just call it chicken soup? Weird. It was still good. Call ahead to place your order because the wait can be a little long during the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing here is the cajun chicken caesar salad! They have one of my favorite caesar salads in town.  They also have great sandwiches.  I'm pretty sure I have never had anything I don't like.  It can get busy at lunchtime, but they do a good job of providing fast service."}
{"text":"Sacks is near to my work place.  They serve the best ever chipotle chicken sandwich ever !! I come down thinking to try something else, but mostly end up ordering my favorite again. Am sure all their other menu tastes great. Cheers to Sacks !!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!   Quality ingredients where you can get a gourmet sandwich with whatever you want on it. You pick your toppings and they make it happen. The pumpernickel bread is the best!   Don't pass up a chocolate chip cookie; you can even buy the dough if you so please.   Comfortable environment.   Fantastic lunch spot."}
{"text":"Napkin mittens.     How is it possible to destroy a sandwich and it's contents in the matter of 30 seconds?   Let's see, they put it together with yummy ingredients then they must use a large stick to shove it in the wrapper.  Nice party trick but not good at a restaurant.  What a mess when you open it, and I even had to use a spork to finish it.  Anyways, the food tastes good and the free cookie is a nice touch.   Oh yeah, the other beef I have with this place is the sign \"Drink refills for large size only!\" WTF!!!  I'll be inventing those napkin mittens before I come back to this place again."}
{"text":"While Sacks has many delicious sandwiches, If you like cheese steaks, you will appreciate the skillfulness and artistry with which Sacks creates their Encore sandwich. On an eight inch, toasted french roll, they generously place hot, juicy prime steak meat, your choice of hot or mild peppers, tomatoes, lettuce and a creamy, delicious feta yogurt dressing. Their soda sizes vary from an extreme small size to a large size cup that looks like a take-out-won-ton soup container. They have a great selection of iced teas and lemonade that make for great Arnold Palmers. Whenever I'm in Phoenix, I have to stop by and I recommend you do too."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see all the negative reviews of this place.  I have been to each and every location and there would not be crowds of people most of the time if these reviews were to be believed (the angry vegan made me LOL).  Seriously though people, it's a sandwich, it's not a life-changing event.    I love their sandwiches, especially the Symphony and the Encore.  This location is close to home and the staff is always super friendly and pleasant, and I always call ahead so I don't have to wait.  They have a very extensive freshly brewed iced tea offering (like 6 different kinds), and the ingredients are always fresh and tasty, not boring or bland.  I seriously can't get over all the haters on here who say they can make their own sandwich at home for less - you totally should!  The prices here are about $6.29 for a large sized sandwich, a mere dollar and a quarter difference from Subway! Plus the free cookie, there really is nothing better for the price."}
{"text":"Someone in class suggested this place and it was such a let down. A large group of us went and many people liked their sandwiches but my turkey cranberry w/ stuffing sandwich was awful. The stuffing looked like dog food and it tasted like cardboard and fennel. The cranberry sauce tasted like it came from a can and there was nothing special about the bread. The upside is we got our orders fairly quickly and the atmosphere was alright for a quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"Gothic is an amazing sandwich.    Turkey breast, ham, sautéed mushrooms, melted Swiss cheese, lettuce, mayo, on an 8\" toasted baguette.  6.89  Comes with a cookie in the bag."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich place I've found in Phoenix/Scottsdale, which is unfortunately not saying much. This place is very nice, a good place to just pick up a sandwich or eat a sandwich or salad there. Great meat and cheese and fillings, but like every other place I've tried, disappointing bread. Their \"French roll\" is a soft sub-type bread you might buy at the grocery store, not the delicious crunchy fresh bread I'm used to in the San Francisco Bay Area. I will keep coming here, but I beg of AZ to discover fresh Dutch Crunch, Sourdough, and sweet French rolls."}
{"text":"Really mediocre, just plain jane boring sandwiches.  They skimp on key ingredients, like cream cheese on the lox sandwich on pumpernickel, which btw the bread tastes stale and the worst pumpernickel I have ever had, not fresh or nice tasting at all.  Just really not a very good place and not very good sandwiches.  The thing that really earks me and inspired me to write the review is their cocky name Sacks \"Art of Sandwicherie\".  There is NO art going on here, just plain boring commercialized sandwiches that sound good but disappoint.  I will never be coming back, there are much better alternatives.  Basically anything other than subway will win this place out.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite downtown lunch places!  Sandwiches are made fresh and the place has a HUGE variey!  Every sandwich is paired with a little chocolate chip cookie which is also delicious.  I had the Michaelangeo - an off the menu special that my co-worker recommended.  Soft bagguette with grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms, cheese and fresh spinach with a creamy balsamic dressing.  The sandwich was slightly warm with a combination of fresh toppings.  So yummy!"}
{"text":"NTG (not that great). If you're looking for a run of the mill sandwich Sack's is okay, but on the expensive side.  Pumpernickel bread should have some texture to it, not just be like white bread with some pumpernickel flavoring. Why is it you can't get good bread in the valley? But I digress.  I ordered my sandwich to go and I'm glad I did. This place is loud and with a school in the neighborhood had way too many kids in it for me. Plus the sandwich was just okay.   Sorry Sack's...I won't be back. There are too many other better choices in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this folks but I went by Sacks (Indian School & 48th St) today and it is GONE! I can't find any info about the closing online so am hoping that the other locations are still up and running... Really liked this place too!"}
{"text":"\"The Remington\"..... can't stay away from it! The others I have tried are delicious too. PLUS, you get a cookie with every meal :)"}
{"text":"For some reason I find it incredibly difficult to find a good sandwich in this town - its either Subway or a sit-down restaurant so I was thrilled when I found Sacks... a happy medium. It's perfect for a midweek sandwich with coworkers. Its a no-frills restaurant... don't go expecting to be wowed by the interior or \"vibe\" of the place, but rather a quick and tasty sandwich. My personal favorite is the Sack's Symphony with added honey mustard. My girlfriend always gets the Mona with salmon. Bonus - every order comes with a chocolate chip cookie.   Note - during the lunch hour it can get busy and loud. We like to order ahead and skip the line by hitting up the \"to go\" counter."}
{"text":"I have to say that I really enjoy eating at Sacks.  It's definitely one of my top two lunch spots for yummy quick eats.  I've sampled quite a bit of the menu and my second favorite sandwich is the O'Keefe.  It's basically chopped chicken, sautéed mushrooms, melted Swiss, avocado, lettuce, tomato and honey mustard served hot on a soft baguette.  The honey mustard gives it just enough tang to really bring out the flavor of the seasoned chicken.  My only \"beef\" with this sandwich is hot lettuce.  I'm sorry, but there are some things in this universe that were not meant to be, and lettuce being served on a hot sandwich (or on a hot Mexican food plate; more on that later) is not one of them!    My most favorite sandwich here is the Symphony.  I like to think of it as a turkey club with a twist.  It's loaded with fresh turkey breast deli style meat, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, LOTS of alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese and mayo on wonderful 12 grain bread.  I usually hold the mayo, because that's just the kinda guy I am.  You might say, that's how I roll. But I say, I'm just not a mayo kinda guy...  The best part about lunch at Sacks is the silver dollar sized warm chocolate chip cookie you get with your sandwich.  And yes, it's been reported that the Tiki sometimes eats the cookie first, but having no photographic evidence, you can't prove it and I'll plead the 5th.  And speaking of tiki's there's a really cool Tiki at the Tutor Time just a few doors down to the north.  Check it out!  Okay, I said the cookie was the best part of lunch at Sacks, but I lied.  The really super dooper best part about lunch at Sacks is the Market Spice Iced Tea.  Some days it's too weak, some days it's too strong, but on the days that it's just right, it will blow your socks off, so you might want to bring an extra pair, just to be safe!  My only dislike about Sacks is that is can get pretty loud at lunch.  It's usually crowded between 12-12:30 so I try to go early or after 1 pm.  And don't forget, you can always call ahead and take it to go!"}
{"text":"We made a large order for our office for lunch, and went to pick it up. When we got back to the office, we realized one of the orders wasn't quite right. We called and couldn't be more pleased with the outcome. Not only did they apologize, and make us another meal, but also refunded our money. As a local business, we were very pleased to be treated in such a caring manor. ~Allstate"}
{"text":"I have been craving the heck out of this place!  I finally looked it up and found there was one not too far from me that I hadn't known about.  I might make that a lunch run but MAN I just want to be back at this one!   It's special.  Oh... it's not just the sandwiches - though they are super yummy.  The Symphony is my favorite, with it's yummy turkey breast, bacon, alfalfa, tomato, alfalfa sprouts and cream cheese spread on 12 grain bread (I have them hold the avocado).  SO good every time!  But what makes this particular location so special?    Firemen.    Yup.  Firemen.  There must be a firehouse nearby because at least 4 out of 5 times I've gone over there there were groups of firemen.    Hello???  Hot firemen and good sandwiches??  Yum yum yummie."}
{"text":"Art of Sandwicherie. Clever, no? Too bad their approach left me with mixed emotions.   If you've never been here, prepared to be overwhelmed. Seriously. The menu is so big, you don't know where to start. Go with a friend who's been and can give you pointers. My lunch friend made a couple recommendations. I ended up ordering the Mona Lisa. I was gonna nix the lemon capper mayo, but I figured a little wouldn't hurt. Whoa. Both slices of bread were slathered with this white stuff. Not bad taste. Just bad on the waist.   The sandwich was very, very good. Smoked salmon with sprouts on pumpernickel bread. It was very good, and I was very hungry.   But I just ordered one sandwich and it came to $7.57. That doesn't include anything else. No drink, except water (which was tap). I'm told they charge for everything here - every little extra you ask for. So, my cup of water my have cost me. Who knows.   My sandwich came with a \"free\" cookie, too. Come to think of it; maybe they charged me for that too!  Would I be back? Well, yes. You buying? I mean, I love a good sandwich. I also love getting my money's worth. For $7.57, I would have hoped for a sandwich large enough for me to divide between lunch and din-din. No avail. I wolfed the entire thing down happily. Even better, it didn't make me bloated later, which I feared, since most foods tend to be heavy on the salt.  The interior is a bit messy in the sense that it's chaotic. This is more of your lunch rush place. Order. Grab. Eat. Run.   When you place your order, they ask your name. Then they call your name when it's ready. I told the cashier how to spell my name, so when the order-yeller looked peeved that nobody was picking up the sack, I felt no remorse. \"Alisia\" is not how you spell my name. I let the cashier know this. He just shrugged.   In fact, that's one stellar way to sum up Sack's. Just shrug. Go on. Do it now. Shoulders up. Shoulders down. Yep. That's exactly how I feel about this place."}
{"text":"Yeah, not so good, and I have given this place several chances.  The sandwiches are overstuffed, kind of sloppy and made with sub-standard quality ingredients.  I would actually rather get a sandwich from subway.  And it it way too loud to sit inside this place.  I wish it was better then it is because I can literally walk here from my house.  The salads are pretty good.  I'll give them that."}
{"text":"As a long time Subway fan, I was shocked with the horrific Jared accusations. In fact, I was FLOORED. Recently stumbled in to your sandwichery and was surprised because I thought Subway had the \"freshest\" quality of meats and condiments in the Nation, but I was sorely mistaken! Glad to finally find a place I can trust again with good quality ingredients and wholesome workers!!"}
