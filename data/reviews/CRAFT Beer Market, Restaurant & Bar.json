{"text":"Sure beats Mother Tuckers.  they did a great job converting this old space in the beltline.  With over 100 beers on tap it's hard to go wrong.    They added some really cool foods to the menu as well.  Fast-food sushi?  Nice.  You should give that a try if you're a fan of bacon...and who isn't.  A couple of the bartenders are awesome, so I'd sit at the bar if you can...it's worth the experience and they really know their beer.  Other servers are a bit hit or miss, but they are still pretty new.  Overall it's a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm giving CRAFT a 3 star because I've only been once. I really enjoyed the atmosphere - but was very loud.  I'm not a beer drinker, tried a mojito and meh, wasn't the best. Too sweet for my liking.  The food, however, was VERY good. I was looking for a gluten-free meal, and perused their menu before my visit. I was a bit disappointed that their gluten-free wording was a bit misleading - you cannot order gluten-free wraps.  We ordered the ribs to start. Wow, those were really great! I was expecting typical small dry ribs like you'd get at Earls, but these were juicy and big (you only get about 5).  I ended up ordering the fish tacos with gluten-free shells after debating between that and a burger. (I really wanted the spicy tuna wrap, but couldn't get a g-free option). The meal was really tasty, even the garden greens were delish.  The waitress was very helpful, and I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to finally eat here and drink. I came for New Years but just danced instead of try anything. Last night was the perfect time to come. The place was nearly empty with people at tables here and there. Mostly people sat at the bar (which is amazing by the way).  We sat at a table. I love tall chairs so this was a treat for me. To start I had the fish tacos which my brother and I shared. We added one so that we got 4 rather than 3. They were amazing. What ever the spice mix is on the fish is to die for! I'm really picky about fish and it was fresh and seasoned well. The tacos didn't last long we pretty much inhaled them. I also loved the hot sauce that came with them.  For mains my brother got the sticky ribs. He shared one with me. OMG fall off the bone tender and so juicy. What ribs should taste like!  I stole some of his brussel sprout side (which I could have eaten a huge bowl of all to myself.) For my main I got the Halibut, again fresh and quality fish did not disappoint. Great flavours the entire dish was tied together nicely and everything rounded out the palate very well.  Amazing job Craft! I don't know why I haven't eaten here sooner but you might not get rid of me from this point forward. (Also parking on 10th on a Sunday evening is a breeze! totally worth the trip down!)"}
{"text":"I've never been motivated to write a review before but my experience here was so unwelcoming I wanted to share it so others are prepared if the should venture in.  A friend and I spent a recent Saturday morning moving boxes; as a thank you I offered to buy him a beer. Our first choice was National on 10th but it was closed because of the recent flooding. We wandered over to Craft and as it was about 11:30 am it wasn't terribly busy (I'm sure people weren't aware they were open either because of the flooding). There may have been about 20 people out front and the back was empty.  Even so we were greeted by a fairly aggressive hostess; we assumed that it was seat yourself since it was a pub - she didn't say otherwise but positioned herself between us and the tables; there was no way we were going in without her as an escort! She waved some menus at us and tried to herd us to a tall table. There was an open table right beside the window where the cool breeze was and we were hot from moving boxes in the sun. When we asked for that table she hummed and hawed then finally said because we weren't part of a large group we could't have that table. In retrospect I should have lied and said we had 3 friends coming but I got all principled and after sitting at the rickety table right by the stairs, far from the window, for about 30 seconds, we got up and went somewhere else.  The idea of a drinking and eating establishment is to make people feel welcome, not to treat them like the unpopular kids in high school. I'm in my 40's and life is short. I have no time for the Craft approach to customer service.  Avoid"}
{"text":"I had a great time here. Tons of excellent choices, the food is good and I love the decor. Plus we wound up chatting a lot with the owner, who is super friendly and (obviously) beer-savvy. We liked it so well we actually stayed in town an extra day so we could go back and try more beers."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and it's hard to get a table but it has a good atmosphere, the music isn't too loud so you can talk, and it's a good place to meet people. I've ate there twice, both times were excellent. The ahi tuna appetizer is amazing, probably the best I've ever had.  On the weekends they pull the bar stools at 9, so if you want to eat get there early."}
{"text":"Really torn on this place. Our server, Sheena was amazing! We had a big group and she took such good care of us. Beer was great, we had a fun time, but the food was just ok. Love the Gluten free choices, but the steaks most of our guys had were were either over cooked or way too rare.  Lobster lasagna was mushy and the pulled chicken sandwich was ok, but when i think of pulled Chicken I think of slow-cooked and full of flavor, which this was not. Like I said, torn. Could be such an amazing place to come for eats, but they need to pick up their food."}
{"text":"Just ate and drank here today on a family trip to Calgary.  Loved the enormous beer list, with what looked like 50+ beers on tap from around Canada and the US.  Food was outstanding as well, and service was prompt and friendly.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Massive amount of beers to select from on tap (deschuttes chainbraker IPA is awesome!). I didn't have any food, but they have very attentive and friendly staff. Their bartender Nate was fantastic during our stay and deserves recognition for being so personable."}
{"text":"A For Atmosphere, F for Food - Craft Beer Market is hopping (unintended pun), not for its lacklustre, mediocre, undersized, overpriced food, rather for its location, room size, and the fantastic people watching. The peeps run the gamut, from Rick Redneck, Rob Roughneck, Ollie Oil Guy, Perpetually Dressed Casual Friday Guy, Biz Suits, Retail Sales Suits, UFC Wannabes, even Artie Aristocrat, they all make an appearance at Craft. Women, being the fairer sex, and deserving of more deference, do not require the judgemental adjectives, also vary in presentation here. Slow George had the Classic Burger, the patty was dry and short on flavor; Princess B had the Steak Salad, 4 pieces of beef on wilted and sparse spin; I partook in the Brew Masters Chicken Sang-Wich, chicken breast was tiny and overcooked and instead of menu stated avocado, got guacamole (there's a big diff in flavor in texture & taste between the two); both Slow G and I had fries as part of entrees. The frites, both in size and paper container, reminiscent of the portion found in a McD Happy Meal, just without the taste and certainly no prize; also, being a fan of the deep fried onion goodness, I ordered the Onion Petals for $9! (come on, a quarter onion for 9 sheckles, come on! They've already made their money on serving me a quarter potato's worth in fries!), they were good, but hard to swallow knowing they were price equivalent of gold bullion. On another occasion, the Ra Ra Sisterhood ordered microscopic Crab Cakes (the size of a poker chip) and S&P Wings. G Gurl and I had Barrel Nachos, yeh Barrel alright, barrel of money they're making off of this order for $21 (18 plus 3 for guac), a few chips deceptively served on a keg lid (ingenious marketing) to give the perception of a mountain of nachos; a true indicator of how few chips there were, is that we actually had depleted the small amount of nachos and still had condiments (salsa, sour cream, guac), left over. Service here, however, is always good, servers are pleasant and on top of things. The shenanigans here are noteworthy. One eve, we had three different approaches from varying individuals who sat with us uninvited but much enjoyed for their antics. We even saw a heavily inebriated female squished into her sausage dress attempt manoeuvres usually only performed in Vegas, let's call it Cirque Du Drunk. Another group was comprised of mature females who stated \"the guy WE'RE with is a millionaire, he'll buy us all drinks.\" The Old Money Bags Guy did show, but of course, it was the ladies who attempted to run out on their bill, until the waitress caught them. Then there was the guy who spoke about the lack of \"chicks\" in the bar, only to speak of his WIFE being at the cabin; Wow. So head to Craft, with the expectation of fun, frolic and lots to envision, just eat first before you arrive, or you'll leave empty of wallet and stomach."}
{"text":"Came here with friends during a short trip to Calgary. VERY spacious place with tons of seats and an endless list of beers for you to choose from. A very well done place for people to chill and relax.   Food wise, it was mediocre. The nachos were HUGE (definitely recommend ordering, but then again I'm biased since nachos are my #1 loved bar food) and the blue cheese burger was good. The pretzel bites and the Mac and cheese were other items that I would not want to get again.   The sheer number of beers here will seriously overwhelm you. Over 100 different beers? I still can't tell the difference between a lager and an IPA! Or all these other terms for beer, for that matter. Regardless, they make it easier by grouping them into sections, and the servers are helpful about it.   One thing that ruined the experience (apart from the bad food choices) was the lack of wifi. Tried to communicate with the server several times to get the password, but apparently there's a problem and it cannot be accessed... couldn't Instagram the food on the spot D:"}
{"text":"Good place for a drink and pub food with friends. Always very busy....Maybe I am getting old, but it is way too noisy for me! Music blaring, raised voices etc....tough to park because it is downtown but that is expected."}
{"text":"I remember when this location used to host Mother Tucker's, a mainstay in Calgary for many years.  It seems this location's kept the hardwood flooring, but the main area is much more open than before, which really highlights how large the area is.  I never fully appreciated how much space was in the venue.  I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I have to admit that they had a lot of variety.  No Sam Miguel's that I could see, but they had Sapporo, Fruli, a gluten-free option, and more.  The food menu looked interesting as well, although when I went, I didn't have much room in my stomach left to sample as I had eaten already prior.  I'm looking forward to going back though to try some more things in depth and to write a more detailed review.  22/30"}
{"text":"We had terrible service. Upon arrival, the waiter turned us away. On a Monday night. \"We don't like your type\". 6 guys out for dinner. We went next door to Briggs. Fantastic establishment!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to see the average review of this place is only 3 stars. I don't write a ton of reviews but I felt like I needed to disagree with the current reviews. I live in Seattle but come to Calgary often for work and so I eat out a lot. I've been to SO many restaurants in Calgary and this is one of my favorites for food. I love fine dining and have been to all the fancy places in Calgary and have had mixed experiences. Some great, some mediocre.   But at craft, I love the selection of beer and the food is great! The ambiance isn't my style but I often just grab a booth and use the free wifi to get some work done. I won't down-rate it for the ambiance because there's nothing wrong with it - it's just not what I'm looking for at this stage in my life.   They have so many amazing Belgians on tap, incredible! The service has always been great. And I just love their classic burger on the pretzel bun with homemade pickles and sharp cheese, yum!! Sooo good. I've had their lettuce wraps and other items too, also delicious. Their sweet potatoe and their regular fries are both perfect and sometimes it's hard to choose because they just nailed them. I tend to prefer to eat really really healthy but this is the kind of burger I make an exception for, I just love it.   I always make a point to come here when I'm in town for work and I've always had great experiences. Excellent food, service and beer on tap. The ambiance is great, if you're looking for social hour and meeting people. If not, you can do like me and bring your laptop and be anti social. It's all good.   Overall, Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food:  5/10 (I order Tuna wrap, very dry) Drinks:  5/10 (recommended beer was not that great, room temperature) Service:  4/10 (extremely slow; it was Wednesday night - not that busy); the lady did not even acknowledge me, just looked at my boss the whole time"}
{"text":"Craft has a big space and they definitely aren't having trouble filling it. My friends and I had tried to get in to Craft in April and a bouncer kicked us out of line because one of our group was drinking in the lineup (totally fair - not complaining at all). But you can imagine our surprise, after the intense security from last time, when we arrived to no lineup, no bouncer, and nobody IDing. Inside was absolutely packed. It took ages just to get one beer for one of our group. Once we found a table things definitely changed. We all squeezed in and our server was right over (probably because there were 9 of us). She was very good at replenishing our rounds of drinks, but, besides the beers, the other drinks weren't very good. It was still a fun time for awhile. Then myself and two others decided to go outside. When we went to go back in we were told we had to go to the back of the line because we didn't have a stamp. The line was a lot longer than when we first showed up and there was suddenly a bouncer. We had looked for someone to stamp us when we came in and we looked for someone when we came out and NOBODY offered to stamp us. So of course once we noticed the lineup to get in was basically at a standstill we texted our friends and we all left.   So it was a pretty decent bar but it's also very disorganized in some ways and in the end we left after maybe 90 minutes. During that time our group spent a fair amount of money and took the rest elsewhere because of stupid door stamps."}
{"text":"It's odd seeing so many beers on tap. There is a little flavour for everyone, and its obvious that whoever has decided on the selection knows what they are doing. Odd may not be the right word, but refreshing is dangerously close to pun territory. Let's stick with odd because the menu reflects this as well. Can you imagine what a '20 napkin burger' is garnished with? Another hamburger, albiet a very little hamburger.   I went there for a bite around noon today and was pleasantly surprised to see brunch was still being served. After slaving over the monstrous beer list I finally settled on Amber's Sap Vampire Maple Lager. It went well with my fried chicken and waffles, the hint of maple washed everything down nicely.   I like the irreverent. The interior resembles a barn, the menu contains items like hamburger sushi, wrapped hamburgers and fries that resembles sushi, and there is an air of friendliness inside. It's obvious management is willing to have some fun with this place.   Unfortunately, it was not all 'chicken and waffles', I found the fried chicken to be a bit bland and hard to eat because of the monstrous amounts of breading. It was served so hot that I couldn't touch it for a little while, and even then I found it uncomfortable to eat. These gripes only amount to one star, I can't claim to be put out in any way, the experience was delightful. I will definitely be returning, hopefully on a Thursday when the fish tacos are only $2.50."}
{"text":"Went to Craft to enjoy a night out in Calgary with a few people. Loved the open concept.   The beer menu was excellent. 100 beers on tap was awesome. Prices weren't too bad. Food was great. The only negative thing I have to say is it is a bit loud in there, but that comes with the open concept. Would go back and tell friends to give it a shot."}
{"text":"They have a big selection of craft beers and the waitstaffs have excellent knowledge about the products they have. Food was really good and a really good place to just go watch a game."}
{"text":"Craft remains one of my go-to spots for many reasons.   Pros- Beer Selection, Vegan/gluten free food and Food Ethics, lively atmosphere Cons- Pricing (sales and specials) ,  inconsistent staff and customer experience  However, it is a dynamic place and can have a shifting atmosphere, values and service depending on when you go.    Monday to Friday it acts like a resto-pub and is a bit slower, good for hanging out with friends, semi-business meeting/meals and a more casual atmosphere, possibly watching sporting events (no volume on tvs). These days there are often food specials.   Friday and Saturday Nights, it is more like a night club atmosphere (DJ and a small dancefloor), but people are very friendly.  Weekends its more of a family friendly place with morning brunch (Kids can visit til 8pm).  During major sporting events like playoffs Craft is like a sports bar, where the tv volume is loud and the atmosphere intense.     I like to come when the beer is on discount Tuesday and Thursdays. They also have food specials too, $3 Tacos, 1/2 prices Appies on Sundays, etc. Check the website and twitter for their deals.    Craft has over 100 beers on tap, but can also offer wine, mixed drinks and some nonalcoholic options for many different palates. With their rotating handles or limited production beers that change roughly every month, you can try a new beer every time you are there. Look at their seasonal beer menu and the 2 chalkboards for these limited-time brews. Always ask for a beer taster before ordering, as some beers sound awesome, but are not tasty for all.   Their food options change less frequently but remain good choices. I have only been truly disappointed with the fast food sushi, otherwise, most things are a satisfactory or better value.  If you have time, comb the specials and beers and often you can have 3 beers and food for under $30. But it does take some time and concentration.     Staff is inconsistent, but the more you go, the better they become. Once staff know your patterns and name, they anticipate your needs. They can get you a table, when it is busy, bring you new samples of beer and provide better overall service."}
{"text":"Bouncers are aggressive and harassing.  They are looking for a fight to fill their angry needs.  Look out. They WILL ruin your night. They ringed ours, and we weren't close to done or drunk"}
{"text":"I just moved to Calgary from Vancouver and I have found my new favorite hangout. I was super pumped to find a tap house that serves Rogue Dead Guy. Its my absolute favorite. Also the 20 napkin burger was ridiculously fun. A burger so large its garnished with an other smaller burger?"}
{"text":"Don't go when it's busy unless you know staff or management. It is blatant how \"regular\" people are treated second class! Went with a dozen mid 30's for a birthday and got pushed out of a table for owners friends. Watched dozens of people walk past the line up, if they were young in short skirts, or paid the doorman.  Lots of better places than this!"}
{"text":"I've always liked this place. I'm not a drinker, but I am definitely an eater. Food here is great. Last week I went for YYC Burger Week, and it did not disappoint. This was my 2nd favorite burger after the Blowfish Ramen Burger. The pretzel bun has such a good texture and flavor. Remember that feeling running home on the last day of school? Imagine that feeling wrapped up in a burger with a pretzel bun, and you there you have it.   Only tough part is finding a table on a busy night. You walk around forever and you start to feel like an american soldier searching for WMD's in Iraq... but WMD's you desperately want to find... with food on them... OK it was a bad metaphor, but you get it. Hard to find a table."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of beer, but not such a great selection of other spirits!   The food portions were good but the food was rather tasteless.  I did like the rustic ambience and the staff were nice and fast.  Go to this place if you like beer and more beer!"}
{"text":"Great selection of draft beer with rotating selection. Excellent casual food. Can't beat it. Family friendly too. Try the once monthly beer pairing brewmasters dinners."}
{"text":"Went there for burger week. What a rip off. Wasn't even close to the picture shown. Just a regular burger. Way over priced for $15.00 and dry.  Service was good. Go to A & W just as good and 75% cheaper."}
{"text":"So...many...beers. Anytime I'm looking to try something completely different and want to switch it up from going to one of the many National Beerhall locations, I come here. I went on a Wednesday and they were featuring their Alberta beers for $5/pint. A great way to encourage beer drinkers to buy local. They also have excellent mussels!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for my birthday and I was very impressed with the service and considering that there were 20+ of us. The servers did a great job remembering us, recommending drinks and food, resulting in a happy atmosphere and memorable experience.   One thing I would like to note, however, is that later in the night they had club style music but not really much room to dance. And so you had this awkward situation where people were sitting on bar stools and barely hearing one another. If having loud music (music was good btw), it would be helpful to make some room for a dance floor (and not the small one near the washrooms)."}
{"text":"I love this place even though it's usually busy sometimes!! Good burgers, food & plenty of beers to choose from!! You can ask for a sampler of the beer too!!"}
{"text":"Got to attend the Caskapalooza event yesterday. Had an awesome time. I'm glad Craft Beer Market is putting on events like these. Got a chance to meet up with some of the brewers across the province and have great chats with many others.   Ernie was good for is ensuring our tickets were available when we arrived. The beers were very good and some, like \"Hot Night in Thailand\" were very unique. Great to see some of the craft brewers creativity on show.   This was our first event attending at Craft Beer Market, and the experience was great. To busy having fun and didn't have a chance to sit down... :D"}
{"text":"We had a great night to start. There were four of us who had dinner. Than some friends joined us for a round of drinks. They than tacked on 18 percent and refused to split the bill for us who ate dinner previously. Won't be going back on the principal of the unwillingness to split are bill. Learn to use your pos properly to convenience your customers."}
{"text":"Finally got into Craft yesterday.  The wait wasn't as long as the hostess said it would be, so that made me happy considering the last time I tried to come here the whole place was rented out for a private function.  There's really not much to say about Craft, except that there has been too much hype for a place with expensive beers and bland food.  The atmosphere is nice and the way they renovated the inside is amazing, but that's all that I really enjoyed about the place.  The food... let's just say, don't order the poutine.  What a waste of $11, I've had better poutine for less money at the Stampede.  The serving is small, the gravy was bland, and they hardly put any cheese on it (photo added).  If you like poutine, don't even bother with this one.  For a meal I ordered the Spolumbos Flatbread and my friend had a Pulled Chicken Sandwich on gluten free bread.  I also got my flatbread on gluten free crust, which was good but the sauce basically had no taste to it.  It wasn't the worst I've had, so I'd say give it a try.  My friend said his sandwich was boring and the chicken had no taste, so for $16 he's not recommending it.    They do possess a very long beer list, which is interesting but some of the prices are quite high in my opinion.  It's very hard for a gal from the Maritimes to think of paying $7.15 for a glass of Keith's, not happening.  So, I enjoyed a nice Mill Street for $5.95, which seems to be standard right now.  My friend tried the only gluten free beer available, but at $8.10 a bottle, you won't want much.  The service was ok, not great but not awful.  Food came in pretty good time, but it doesn't seem like they spend much time perfecting it anyway.  Overall, I'd say I probably won't be stopping by here again.  I'm a gal who likes to eat, so with mediocre food there is no sense of me visiting this establishment very much.  Oh well, even though we spent our hard earned dollars on bland food at least we tried it."}
{"text":"On paper it would seem that Craft has everything working in its favor. However, our first visit (and likely our last), put all that hard work to shame.   Firstly, the service was atrocious. Embarassing almost. I understand it takes awhile to iron the kinks out -all 3 of us spent many, many years in the food & beverage industry, but that is no excuse to wait 10 minutes to be greeted and another 20 min for a drink when there are so many servers they are bumping into each other. To sit with an empty drink for another 20 minutes. The servers themselves add to the overall bad vibe of the place. We witnessed 3 servers fighting over tables, the bartender was telling some friends of ours who were sitting at the bar how hungover he was (as if this would be an excuse for the crummy service), and there was zero menu knowledge whatsoever. I asked what sauce was on the clubhouse sandwich, and our server didn't know. She checked with the kitchen and came back with the answer- nothing, just butter. Imagine my surprise when the sandwich arrived with mustard and mayo, the latter being the exact thing I was avoiding. Later we ordered a glass of Syrah- pretty standard- to which she replied- would you like that on ice?? uhhhhh, no thanks. One has to wonder if there was any training done at all before the doors opened.  The amount of beer and lack of experience just adds to the confusion. Even the most seasoned server would have a hard time distinguishing different lagers apart when they are all served in the same glassware. My friend and I ordered one cider, one Wraspberry ale and those were mixed up on delivery- honest mistake. I drink the latter all the time- and that was not what I was poured. I kindly told the server, to which she brought back to who I found out after the fact was the GM- and he TASTED it, and sent it back to me, saying I was wrong. No thank you, I do not want that pint. She proceeded to bring me a sleeve of a very fruity, sweet beer that was much more raspberry in flavour. It seemed to be so condescending...here miss, you wanted a fruity beer? Try this, it's much more girly. I politely said, Thank you, but that is far too sweet- can I just please have something else?? She brought the beer back to the bar, and we proceeded to watch the General Manager pound back the beer I sent back. The same beer that all 3 of us at the table tasted and drank from. That is beyond gross. We couldn't believe we just witnessed it, from the GM of all people.  The 104 beers on tap- great concept...if there was actually 104 beers on tap. When we were there there we 40ish. Also, having alot of experience in the industry- one has to wonder how it is remotely possible to keep all those kegs (even 40) fresh. There is no new technology out there. One has to think come a month from now, there are going to be alot of unhappy customers with spoiled pints. We were very clearly not the only ones not enjoying our visit. Everywhere you looked there were customers with pursed lips, looking impatiently around, waiting far too long for their drinks and starving because their food is taking an hour and their server is no where to be found. Everyone looked stressed- like they really wanted to like the place, but Craft is just digging their own hole.  As for the food- it was mediocre at best. Prosciutto flatbread was SUPER salty. Chicken Club, very dry and boring. Fries were cold and soggy on delivery. Food also took an hour to arrive.  Prices are very high, especially for the beer selection, considering they are served in 12 oz pint glasses. I have no problem paying for a pricey pint when everything else falls into place, but charging $8 for a domestic pint with everything being in a state of chaos, just seems cocky.  On the plus side- the bathrooms are very nice. However, only 4 stalls for the entire place. Thumbs down.  We appreciate opening a new restaurant and the kinks that come with that, but in this city where there is such a selection of places to go to, one has to make sure they are on the top of their game from the get go. It is a piss poor excuse to put forth- \"oh give us a break we just opened\". I compare to WURST which opened the same weekend- where the service is amazing and food is stellar.  It was a very disappointing visit at best for a pub/restaurant (still not sure what they are aiming to be) that we were very excited to see open it's doors. The way they are operating now, Stampede will eat them alive."}
{"text":"Whaaateveeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  We sit at the bar on a slow night and get helped about 10 minutes later. Some beers are on special, just local craft beers or something for $5. Not really special, but ok whatever. We get our drinks properly served. All appetizers are also $5. Woman makes the mistake of ordering poutine and expecting something delicious, I get some wings.  The poutine was served in a miniature iron pan which makes no sense as no part of poutine is prepared in an iron pan. But I guess they did it to be cute. It's portioned pretty small and it had a weird fish taste and smell to it. The woman has had enough and doesn't want it replaced. The barkeep seemed contrite and took it off our bill.  My wings were, wow. Also whatever. Kinda like the wings at the Al Cove. The hot wing sauce is either franks red hot or sysco. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  They had a good selection of beer, but, I mean, the USA has been doing the 100-taps-of-beer-with-no-bottles thing for around 20 years, as has a bunch of bars in Calgary as well. Just like Calgary itself, this place is remarkably ordinary but purports to be something else.  On the upside, I imagine this is a great place to hang out and mack on people on Friday and Saturday nights. That's about the only upside?"}
{"text":"A solid four stars for Craft... what a nice reno from what was the icky Mother Tuckers site.  Big... and I MEAN BIG space... would be a great location for a large corporate function and I can only imagine that next year's Stampede will see Craft import industry tallent and host numerous events.  Of course their big marketing stick is the 100+ beers on tap and this is very easily a reason to attend... the location itself is spiffy too in a modern cosmo industrial style.  On the food side, I was initially a bit luke warm on the food (I suppose in some ways I still am... NOTE TO CRAFT: ditch the paper bags for fries... all it does is steam the fries into soggyness... just a bad idea)  but food has improved and beer/atmosphere sells the rest.  As with other spots South of 9th Avenue, Craft is a bit under attended for whatever reason and having a table is usually not a problem (people should also keep in mind that you can actually get all the way to accross the street through the +15 and Gulf Canada so Craft really isn't far even in the dead of Winter).  The total package makes Craft an easy choice for 4 stars."}
{"text":"I had been craving CRAFT Beer Market's edamame hummus since I first tried it back in May. As today was my birthday and we were going to be in Calgary I thought I would give in and head back to CRAFT just for this delicious appetizer. Even though we were staying in a hotel a good half hour away we made the drive in to pick up a take out order just for my birthday. We drove straight back to the hotel and when I opened the bag I found the tasty little flat bread pieces, vegetables, shishito peppers and NO hummus. I was very upset because this is the one thing I wanted for my birthday not a cake not a big fancy meal just edamame hummus and flatbread & veggies.   My husband in my defence called CRAFT and told them how upset I was with a couple choice words and all they had to say was well if you can dive back we can throw in something extra.   UMMM... Obviously they weren't listening or they lack problem solving skills as my husband said from the get go we were half an hour away and it was already 11:30 (they closed at midnight). All I can say is I'm extremely disappointed the one birthday meal I wanted I was let down. Guess I'll just have to make my own version and share the recipe with the world so others don't have to put up with shotty customer service."}
{"text":"Saturday, Sept 17 in the afternoon. Sat in the lounge on the main floor. It took two requests and 15 minutes later to get a server to order drinks. A different server dropped off our drinks and said \"I'm your server now.\" The arugala and parmesan flatbread was tasty. My husband said the cheese burger was okay. Our friend ordered a $25 steak. He ordered it medium rare and received it medium well. When he alerted the server she took it back. He waited 40 minutes to receive his MEDIUM RARE steak. Not once did the server check on his order until he said something to her. Rob the manager came by when we were leaving to apologize. That's all well and good but he gave my friend a \"free appetizer\" card that expires by September 30 in place of a $25 steak.Typical Calgary service. Over promise and under delivers."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a game, especially if you're looking for something better than typical pub grub. Awesome fish tacos & shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"For my beer loving boyfriend, this place is heaven on earth. Set up what is probably the best man cave ever with over 100 beers on tap and the tastiest pub food around; it's never a question why it's always busy here.  Although I'm not a huge burger fan, CRAFT serves theirs on a yummy pretzel bun that takes their burgers to another level. I am in love with their fish tacos - spicy grilled basa on a bed of cabbage and pico de gallo and CRAFT's signature hot sauce. Throw some of their sweet potato fries with those and I'm a happy girl. Other food I've tried: wings (can't go wrong with these), fast food sushi (cheeseburger and fries wrapped in bacon presented sushi style - it was really the fact that there was bacon that I ordered these. Not that great, don't think I'd get them again) and the CRAFT mac and cheese (it's too spicy for my liking)  I like this place, good eats and good times. You can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"I am always happy when I leave here.  They have my favorite beers on tap and really good food.  I like to go on Sundays where the apps are half off.  I enjoy the atmosphere and think it is beautiful inside."}
{"text":"One of my favourite happy hours downtown! From 3pm - 6pm on weekdays and all day Sundays, you can get pints of all Alberta beers for $3. And there isn't just a few Village or Wild Rose beers to choose from, we're talking Banded Peak, Troubled Monk, Cold Garden, Fahr Brew, Theoretically Brewing, Six Corners, Common Crown, Bench Creek, Outcast, Half Hitch, Blindman and more!   Local beers are $6.25/pint (or smaller if it's a really strong beer) anyway, but $3 makes it a no-brainer. I've always had really good service too, and particularly enjoyed a flatbread and the mac and cheese on a recent visit.  Pro tip: If you`re coming after work on a Friday, make a reservation! This place gets packed since, you know, $3 pints..."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Craft.The beer was excellent with lots of choices.The food was also very good.The appetizers were half price and tasted fresh. The service was friendly and efficient. The whole place felt comfortable and spacious and the washrooms were modern and clean. I will definitely be back to Craft!"}
{"text":"In an effort to find a pub that does brunch, I ended up at Craft.   I like Craft. I like Craft because mostly my friend Parker works there (killer good bartender) so every time I'm there, I have a good time.  There are other reasons I like Craft besides the beer and Parker; the food is generally good and not too 'pubby', they have a vegetable plate on the menu which I really like and the stools are really wide and really soft.  These things considered, I headed to Craft for brunch.  The menu for brunch was more detailed than I expected and my breakfast mate - who normally will order two breakfasts - only needed to order one Trucker breakfast which was suitably giant.  The food was good, the bacon crispy without being too hard and the potatoes did not feel like an afterthought, which was a nice change of pace.  However, Craft did not do such a stellar job with the whole \"getting our order right\" thing.  My breakfast came out with sausages instead of bacon, sunnyside up eggs instead of poached; my friends' breakfast came without any meat at all and my toast was half sourdough (which I ordered) and half white (which I did not).  The manager did apologies for the screw-ups, got my breakfast fixed and brought out the meat that was missing from my friends' breakfast; but my toast was never fixed and we were never compensated for the mishap.  To be fair, I don't expect to be compensated for every little mistake and I can understand if sometimes wires simply get crossed and things go wrong; but I do expect a little perk for four screw-ups on the same order. (maybe 10% off? free coffee?)  Fortunately Craft has good food, good beer and is usually crowded which I like and I have yet to be there on any evening where the food came out that wrong or my beer wasn't full; so I will probably be back, but probably not for brunch.  T."}
{"text":"Craft is alright. The house beer selection is decent, though not great. The food is decent, though not great. What floors me about the place is that I can get rare beers that I really like. For example, Boddingtons, Kronenberg and Anchor Steam. An unexpected plus. I don't really like the environment though. It's too noisy and often times they pack people in. It's worse on nights where the upper level is reserved. Lots of TVs so you don't miss the game."}
{"text":"We went for lunch as a group of 13 and received terrible service. We had limited time over our lunch hour so pre-ordered. Food was ready shortly after we arrived but after our food was delivered, we didn't see our server again until we waved  her down to get our bill. No one picked up our plates or refilled our water, and to my knowledge, even checked on our food. We had to wave down our server to pay, a process which took forever, then realized they tacked 18%  onto our bill for a tip. I guess that's why she couldn't be bothered to give even adequate service. Food was average. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Craft Beer Market is in a pretty large location where the old Mother Tuckers used to be on 10th ave.  Their claim to fame is their large selection of draft beer (at any given time, there are over 100 on tap).  They rotate in seasonal beers regularly, so their selection is always changing.  I love me some good beer, so I'm working my way through their beer passport (goal:  drink 100 different beers).  I typically stick to dark lagers or hoppy IPA's, but I've been surprised to enjoy some of the sweeter beer selections such as the Vampire Maple and the Steigl Radler (Steigl mixed with grapefruit juice... who would have thought?! It's delicious!).  This place is almost always busy.  They do take reservations for lunch, and on Sunday through Wednesday nights.  If you don't have reso's, it is up to you to scout out a table... this usually requires some patience, but the place is huge, so something is bound to open up eventually.  I can't comment on Friday / Saturday nights here (I'd rather come when it is slightly quieter and easier to find a table).  Since opening, their serve staff has gotten a LOT better (both from a speed and a knowledge of the beer menu perspective).  They still aren't perfect, but with all that beer, it can't be easy.  The food here is decent, and they always have something on special- whether it be their fish tacos, pastas or flatbreads.  They recently also launched a weekend brunch menu with some classic items (3 different Egg Bennies), and a few unique ones (Chicken & Waffles anyone?!).   I tend to come here more for the beer than for the food, but with over 100 beers to try, I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Large place with a ton of beer, but often not enough seating and kind of pricey.  Food is pretty good"}
{"text":"Ripped off on Father's Day ! All $5.95 beer was on special for $4.00 (excluding seasonal), I ordered a Big Rock Dunkleweisen, first and then a Big Rock Scottish Style Heavy Ale, the other three people's  beers were as ordered. We ate and when bill came, surprise, instead of Dunkleweisen I was charged for Dunkle $9.05, and $5.95 for the Scottish, waitress said she repeated Dunkle, yea IMO short for Dunkleweisen and the Scottish was seasonal. Both statements were BS, but instead of making a scene, I will not return and certainly won't recommend it.  The food was just Okay at best"}
{"text":"I wish I could give -1 stars for my last experience at Craft. My husband & I went for brunch. We had modest expectations to begin with, because you should never set your sights high when going to a bar for brunch, but we weren't prepared for what a disaster our meal would actually be. We were seated in the back of the restaurants next to, I kid you not, five tables of six people with CHILDREN. I understand it's the middle of the day, but the last thing I want is a 4-year-old throwing cheerios at my caesar. Service was slow, probably because our server was caring for 30 people, one-third of which were under the age of five. My food came out cold, but even piping hot wouldn't have been worth the $10 bargain it was already priced at. I took one bite then asked for our cheque so we could go get breakfast elsewhere (I ended up with a crepe from La Boulangerie in Mission, a much better buy). Craft took care of our bill and apologized but I would have just rather they seated us away from the kids section and served hot food instead. I never really liked Craft to begin with, because it's ridiculously busy and beers cost upwards of $9, but now I'll probably never go back again. Two thumbs way down for everything you do, Craft."}
{"text":"CRAFT has a great location and a great space.  The night I went it was PACKED.  Thankfully my friends had snagged a table.  Our server was very attentive even though she was having to plow through the crowds to get to us.    I wasn't feeling deciding on a beer so I said \"Surprise me\".  She brought me their grapefruit beer which was awesome.  I would go back just for that  beer!  I hope to go back soon to try out the food."}
{"text":"We had a great experience tonight. A group of ten is never easy to handle but Stephanie did a great job. Service was on point, on time, attentive and everyone enjoyed the food   Huge selection of beers. Soundtrack was good, too. Really enjoyed the evening."}
{"text":"I've gone to Craft a couple of times in the first month of its opening.  I had lunch on the second day of its opening and the food was excellent but service was slow as their internal systems were being ironed out and am sure this will improve over time.  The food fare includes more upscale burgers, salads, flatbreads than you would find at your neighborhood pub. The beer selection is fabulous and I would highly recommend the beer sampler which offers 6 - 4 oz beers for $9. Would rate a 4 star if service turnaround time improves."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, but everything is a tad pricier than is called for. Food is decent but nothing amazing.  Good vibe with lots of young people out after work and all day on weekends. A solid after work spot for drinks."}
{"text":"Oh, Alright. Time to poke my nose in here and put in another swell, no, swollen two-bits worth. CRAFT, aw.....CRAFT. I truly NEEDED to Love Yee! I live a block and a half away. When I first heard you were opening, this close to my little nest, I instantly thought of signing a FIFTEEN Year Lease, on an Apartment I've been trying to get out of for 12! The value of the neighborhood just increased by 300%,*mind you, in the Beltline that ain't tough to do. Dandelions would improve it by at  least 15.  So? On to the Posies and the Punishment.  I went twice in two days. Hey, Fish TACOS? Yah, Baby Yah. 100+ Beer(s) on TAP? An irresistible force.  OK, Here's the good news, The place is young and fresh and vibrant and, and, and..... What's fantastic is this. I've never had a better tasting pint of Big Rock Traditional. EVER. Bubbly, effervescent, just plain CLEAN. Well, whaddid'ya expect? New Kegs, New Lines, New Taps. Ouchie Mama! Does it get much better than this?  OKee! Now lets dig in to those 100 Beers on Tap. I'll have a.... a...wait,. let me take some time with the huge Beer menu. OK I'll have a...Tapped OUT? How about a....what? Tapped OUT? Alright I'll try a.... Tapped OUT?  Day 1 I had an Okanagan Springs Pale Ale, I LOVE this stuff on Tap. Day 2? Tapped Out.  OK.  They're almost brand new. But on Sunday, after the Buffet was over, I ordered a simple order of fries @ 1:15, after which I was told the Kitchen wasn't gonna open till 2. At 2? Mistake, The kitchen won't be open till 3. They finally arrived, on the house, at 3:20 After that I ordered a Burger, which was quite different but certainly not worth whatever it was not worth. The gravy tasted like Vinegar. Service was very good on Day 1, and piss poor on day 2 when it was a LOT slower. Logan, Michael? You two rocked. Rob (Manager) was convivial.  Now. Newborns don't pop out walking, unless they're future lawyers and then they pop out swimming.... so I don't expect CRAFT to run like a well oiled unit for a wee while to come. But? I've prognosticated this to some of the boys behind the 'Wood'. If you're waving the flag of 100 Beer(s) on tap, you've gotta' fly it at half staff until you can deliver. We're really new is a reason, but it's no excuse. Which means you'll be in a boat load of Owie, come Stampede week if you're poop ain't in a scoop by then. Stampede will be bedlam in there and you probably won't get much slack.  Sat next to a guy named Justin, who really knew his stuff, and I asked him to 'recommend the next', he did, about 9 of 'em in a row. Each of them 'Tapped Out'. AGGGH! OK, 'yer new, 'yer new. I expect a 4* rating in the months to come, and, if you finally pour me anything I order? A solid 5.  Over All? Great Potential. Work it, guys, work it."}
{"text":"I been wanting to try CRAFT for quite some time, (ever since I heard of the over 100 beers on tap) so my friend and I decided to go for dinner Saturday evening.  We arrived at 7PM and it was already very busy but luckily for us there was a nice table that someone just left so we scooped it up! Our waitress came over to us once we sat down and I was impressed with variety of the beer list and I have to say that it did take quite some time to make a decision! Once I did however, our drinks were there in a matter of minutes.   We settled on what we wanted for meals and I was prepared to wait for a while for our dinner to come because it was so busy but I was pleasantly surprised when our order came out 10-15 minutes later. I had ordered the brewmasters chicken sandwich with fries, it was huge and I could only eat half but believe me I wanted to eat the whole thing in one sitting because it was SO GOOD!   I was really enjoying the whole experience (the ambience, the diversity of people, ect.) Until 9 PM came rolling around then the place turned upside down. The music was raised to double the volume, it started to get so busy that people were just crowding into and around every table, the diversity turned into a loud bar crowd and every time we were almost done a glass of beer groups of people kept asking us if we were done yet and if we were leaving because they wanted our table... We weren't done and no we didn't want to leave but the noise and crowd got unbearable so we decided to give up our prime real estate.  Overall my verdict is: Great food, great beer, good service but only before 9PM. (at least on the weekends, weekdays might be different)"}
{"text":"Beer selection is extensive and priced well. Food selection is good, small menu for food but seemed to be almost anything for anyone on it. I feel that the beer and environment is the main reason people go here, not specifically for the food but the food was great regardless. The only negative I have (and is not even a big deal) were the stools, they are pretty high and they are squeezed tightly at the table to accommodate as many customers as possible which made them hard to slide up to and out of the table if you were sitting in the middle of the group."}
{"text":"I love my beer! I love my food! Craft has plenty of both!  Sometimes I want my old standards when it comes to my brew, but now and then I want to try something different. Craft is great for that - I like to treat myself to their flights of beer if there are enough options on there that I haven't tried. It leads to me to discover new things that I like. Last time it was the Gouden Carolus Classic. So good!  Food has varied from good to fantastic! Might not always knock your socks off, but will still be a decent feed. Their nachos are pretty incredible and served in the bottom of a keg barrel. Definitely bring a few people to share!  It is very noisy and sometimes difficult to find a table. However the staff are friendly and helpful, even if they are slow sometimes due to the crowds.  Definitely worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"Very good service, great selection of craft beers. Knowledgeable, pleasant (Alessandra) good music. A great place to grab a beer and some wings after work.  Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Doing a rating update. Went once more today, and was less than impressed with things.  Why do I keep going back to this place? I think part of me really likes the look and feel of the venue, and wants the business to do well. To be cliche, it's like a bad hangover of sorts - you swear you will never hit the booze again, yet soon after you are back drinking your face off.  We went for brunch post-Remembrance Day ceremony. We were showed a table, and our waitress came by and got us some water. Then, 20 minutes later (after having a chat with the hostess who came around), we finally saw our waitress again. Now by this point we'd decided what beers we were going to have, as well as what food we were going to eat. She only took our beer orders, stating that \"we just suddenly got slammed and are short on staff\".  I've worked in the food and beverage service industry in some form for a good chunk of my working existence. I understand that Sundays are a crapshoot of sorts at any establishment (especially anywhere close to downtown). However, it would have taken very little time and effort to realize that there were two Remembrance Day ceremonies within a 2 block radius of your establishment. With that in mind, it would have been a smart move to have called in at least 2 more servers. Rather than being a quick 1 hour brunch, this stretched into just over 2 hours.  Needless to say, our flummoxed server misheard me, so I got brought the tractor size pancakes rather than the normal sized. I felt bad for the confusion and the misunderstanding, but it seemed things were destined to head downhill from here. Our bill came, and we had an extra charge for toast we didn't order, but rather the table beside us did order (and likely didn't get charged for).  So CRAFT, after today's experience, I am quitting you. Permanately. Only exception might be if every other place nearby closes down and you are the only place left that serves beer. But since that's pretty unlikely, we are done here.  Random sidenote for the management - I get that maybe to you the CFL doesn't matter, but we were quite enjoying watching Edmonton get their butts kicked by Toronto when you changed all the TV's to NFL games. We didn't make much noise about it, because by that point we both vowed that we won't be back.  Review #1 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"I'm liking Craft! I don't know whether it is the total mixture of the types of clientele there, or the fact that the restaurant itself is kind of casual yet upscale, or the fact that its got tons of different kinds of beverages available for the variety-lovers like me... or a combination of all these, but it hits the spot.   The place is always crowded, and that's one of the best things about Craft. It creates a buzz. I like buzz. It makes you feel like you're part of the cool crowd. Yes, that might be total propaganda, but let me believe what I want to believe, okay? For real though, if I am going to go out and grab a drink with friends, I want to go to a place that's buzzing. True, I have not had to wait in line (sheer luck though)... If I had to wait in line, I would probably not been so happy about Craft.   Anyway, their wings are pretty decent, the staff is good and conversational, and their beer is damn good. If you're into sweet/fruity/girly beer like me, ask for the grapefruit beer. I did not want to remove the glass from my lips while I downed that thing, and then I wanted more. Its that good.   8/30"}
{"text":"Beer selection is unbelievable, food was pretty good, nothing out standing. Cool building and atmosphere. I had a good time!"}
{"text":"I joined a couple girl friends here for a couple bevvies early on a Friday evening and I was surprisingly shocked by how great this venue was.  It was huge and full of people having after work drinks.  I liked the dark wood and the size of the place.  It was great and full of people my age... not 18 to 20 year olds.  That got a star!  When I arrived it was standing room only so we stood for a bit and had our drinks.  When I went to the bar to get my drink I was served quickly despite how full the place was.  No waiting in lines at the bar for a drink.  Definitely worth one of the stars.  We went upstairs to see if we could find seating and we were to told that we had to put our names on a list and we'd be called, but the guy helping us(who appeared to be a manager) added us to the end of a big table with two other guys at it because we(nor did they) had any issues with sharing a table.  I thought that was great... no waits for a table!  Another star earned!  Our server was quick.  I wasn't planning on eating, but made the mistake of checking out the menu and the poutine nabbed me.  It was really good!  My favorite kind of pub type poutine with real cheese curds and dark gravy.  Really good and not an overwhelming size since I just wanted a snack before my later movie date.  The food and service was another 2 stars!   I will definitely go back and take friends with me!  Lots of friends!"}
{"text":"Let be honest, it is what it is here. Lots of beer on tap, food is pretty ok, servers try their best to be as prompt as possible, and Friday + Saturday nights are generally a gong show.  If you want to have a million choices of beer on tap then this is your place - but try not go during any rush hour beer traffic."}
{"text":"Yoga and brunch at craft was a success!! Took my mom for her birthday and she absolutely loved it:) can't complain about finishing a good yoga session with a beermosa. Thanks craft for helping me make this day special for my mom!"}
{"text":"I attended a function at this location. The bus and wait staff were some of the hardest working I've seen. Empty glasses , boom - cleared. Food - hot and yummy. Beer - its like Willy Wonka's and I was Charlie. I'm defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"20/30  Solid service, noise level was at a comfortable conversation level this Sunday evening and a decent veggie burger. Fries that accompanied the burger were tasty too. I also really appreciated that the waitress didn't pressure us in to getting up before we were ready, since we probably stayed another 45 mins. after the first bill was paid.   $4 beers and hi-balls on Sunday nights and some appetizers are half off. What kept this from being a five-star review was that the veggie burger was a little on the dry side, and I really wish there was a dairy-free dessert option! But I do appreciate that the veggie-friendly part of the menu contains more than just a veggie burger or a bland pasta concoction. Yay, progress :)."}
{"text":"It's just not as good as it should be.  There seems to be a prevailing trend in restaurateurs to open funky beer establishments without the most important ingredient, GOOD BEER.  I went on a Tuesday, which is $2 off every beer and cask night.  I went specifically for the cask that didn't exist.  They have a beer club as well but it takes a well trained staff to push anything in a restaurant and she didn't.  Service was bad.  I was there at 4pm, the place was empty except a dozen staff and it was still slow.  They just know nothing about serving or beer.  The location and building are great, and for that alone I give it a few stars.  The food was OK, I had the steak sandwich and they gave me a steak sandwich.  Nothing fancy very simple.  Value wise, go for the specials.  Beer here is expensive.  Almost prohibitively so, if I didn't go on a Tuesday I would have walked out.  Beers start at 5.50 for domestics and not even for a pint and go up to 9.50 for the actual good ones.  I will not likely go back considering the other options in Calgary."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my night here and a part of me enjoyed having a large array of beers available in front of me, but I think some of the negative reviewers have a point (I enjoyed this: \"Just a generally silly place, I think.\" - Peter A.)  It's a big place with a chain restaurant feel that has decided to go with 'more is better' yet market itself as something different.  I'd prefer a small place with character that actually focuses on craft beer.  At least Craft actually does have some good beer on tap that you don't usually find elsewhere.  Ignore half of their list and pull a lot of money out of your pocket and you'll enjoy some nice stuff."}
{"text":"Came across this place while walking around the area. It was close to the hotel we were staying at (Hotel Arts). I can tell it's a very popular nightlife spot, mostly attracts those in their 20s, with the occasional middle-aged man roaming the bar. My boyfriend and I stopped in here for a drink before heading back to the hotel. Although it was packed, we managed to get a drink at the bar easily, the bartender (an asian guy) was friendly and nice. We didn't stay too long, maybe 45 minutes, but heard good old school music during this time. Beward there are lots of hardcore drinkers here - we saw plenty of drunk clientelle, including the table beside ours where the chick stunbled hard into my boyfriend  when she tried to get up, and not too long after that, fell off the bench seat onto the floor."}
{"text":"Just plain terrible.   Took a craft beer tour and CRAFT was the last stop. There we had some chicken wings and nachos and 3 tasters of their finest craft beer.   VERDICT: One and done."}
{"text":"Craft has over 100 beers from around the world! If you want to choose which beer is right for you before you go, you can take a \"Craft Beer Picker\" quiz on their website before you arrive...otherwise the servers are fantastic with describing each beer and even bringing tasters to the table if you're not sure.  Although I love the Kale Caesar Salad and wings, we ordered two entrees on this visit, the Bacon & Blue Cheese Burger and the Butternut Squash Ravioli both were $17 which was good value and price point.  The burger came with a hand tossed patty stuffed with blue cheese and topped with bacon, caramelized onions, mayo, house made mustard, lettuce, tomato and pickles. It was juicy and delicious!  The Butternut Squash Ravioli was also homemade and had a good amount of raviolis tossed in a Piri Piri emulsion (kinda spicy) and finished with toasted pumpkin seeds and squash chips.  The atmosphere was lively with good top 40 alternative music playing and both NFL and NBA games were on the many tv's that were easily viewed from all the tables in the restaurant.  This is my third visit and every time I just try more and more delicious food and drink. I love this place before a movie or theatre event!"}
{"text":"Came for a drink with friends and enjoyed the environment. Clearly this is a place for beer lovers, but what I admire is the fact that there are really awesome cocktails and some decent wine and hard liquor options as well. I've been to other beer-centric places, and they've always lacked the additional options for those of us who A) can't enjoy beer or B) just don't want to (this probably sounds like heresy to anyone who loves beer!)   Service is really friendly, as well as knowledgeable, which is a plus, considering just how variable the beer menu is. We didn't dine on this visit, but the menu looked pretty appealing.   I suggest the Gin Cesar as an alternative to beer - it was a really nice choice."}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 stars! We came here for the first time ever on a Sat afternoon and had a great time! Highlights - the space itself, terrific service and a fantastic menu with ample foodie choices! (pasta, burgers, flatbread, salads, steak, chicken) Soooo many beers to choose from! If you are a beer drinker, this will be your new heaven. For non beer drinkers, the staff will attempt to win you over with some fruit beer and you will be SOLD if you are anything like me and want your beer to not taste like beer :). I liked all the cherry ones they were pleased to treat us to samples. The hostess and servers love their jobs - it shows. Most Calgary service IMO falls down, not here. Even the manager stopped by to chat, nice guy, hands on and obviously involved in the day to day operations of the restaurant. We ordered the inferno burger (not made to order) with an up sell of poutine on the side and a margarita flatbread. Delicious. The burger was not my order but I had a couple of bites and prefer my burger meat medium rare and not well done but this is how they roll here. The pretzel bun was a wonderful addition that made this burger stand out. The poutine was very good with homemade gravy, organic potatoes and Quebec cheese curds. The flatbread was very good, make sure you get their homemade hot sauce for an extra buck on the side. Our waters could have been filled more often but other than that and my burger meat preference, this was very close to being a 5 star experience. There are TVS playing sport games but the background music at an acceptable level was 80's and 90's tunes. My new fave casual spot for totally reasonably priced eats in downtown Calgary! I HAVE to come back to try the infamous Mac and Cheese!"}
{"text":"The open seating concept is quite challenging, because it's often like a war zone in here. I've been sitting down with a friend in a 2 seater table, and next to us, at another 2 seater table, 18 guys show up. No room whatsoever. Coats everywhere. Waitresses can't get by. This is pretty much how the whole bar is like after work every day. Fire codes be damned!  That being said, if you can get here on an off time, the beer is absolutely amazing and so is the selection. Food is also quite good. It would be nice if they just started seating according to their actual availability and not just try to cram everyone in."}
{"text":"Craft Beer Market is an exercise in good marketing rather than a quality venue.   On the surface, Craft has all the makings of a truly epic brewpub/craft beer venue. As such, I have given this place three attempts. My experience each time was about the same. While they do extensively advertise their 100 beers on tap, many of the more obscure options that may lure a craft beer enthusiast to the venue are typically not in stock.   That's assuming you can make your way to the bar.  Management of this venue has decided that hype and packing a place solid is more important than quality service, which to me doesn't make a ton of sense for a venue that should offer a tasting experience with food and beer pairings. On one occasion where  I managed to get a table, I went 2 hours with only the table clearing staff asking if my server had come by yet. I'm a pretty patient guy and planned on ordering food but simply was not able to.  No problem I'll make my way to the bar.... not so fast. The place is usually packed with the bar staff completely swamped. Maybe it's growing pains, but they don't seem to know where their product is located on the large central bar and it greatly slows down the whole process.   A 50+ lineup outside a venue such as this doesn't make any sense. It's time to drop the charade and classify Craft for what it is; another generic Calgary bar with poor management and mediocre service.  This is one of the few places in the city that you can get some of the more rare Belgian beers on tap and in the proper glass (often a snifter). I recommend La Chouffe - if you can get one."}
{"text":"Wide ranging selection of beer - including some nice sours and saisons.  They don't have the soup I wanted but sent over the soup they did have- I thought it was bland so they nicely took it off the bill.   The wings were tasty - both salt and pepper and hot. The game were fried and then covered with salt or hot sauce . They came with carrot and celery ."}
{"text":"I remember being invited to Craft when it first opened. Being a celiac thought, what am I going to do at a beer market? Well my friend informed me they cater to GF. SInce then I've come many times.   This particular event was for a friends birthday. We found out that whatever age you are turning, you get that discounted from your bill. So my buddy being 32, was glad for once to go out being older vs. young.   We had an awesome server, when we got there it was busy at all, which we found strange for Saturday, but definitely didn't complain.   We only drank this time, but they do have a small section of gluten free beer, as well you can get the pastas, pizzas and sandwiches gluten free. The pizza is super good.   I will continue to come here for sure!"}
{"text":"Holy F. I am very confused as to what to write about Craft. From what I can remember, this is what I thought of this place...  If your a person who doesn't mind standing in line for an hour like a tool to get into a bar, than this is the place for you.                 - The only reason I ended up in here was because my husband's friend had a way to get us past the line.   If your a person who doesn't mind standing in line at the bar to get a beer like a tool, because your waitress/waitor is a tool and takes 20 minutes to bring you beer, than this is the place for you.                - Drinks took forever so I found my self wandering down flights of stairs to the  gigantic bar that was swarming with people, fighting my way through them all, ending up in some girls selfie, waiting at the bar, getting a beer, struggling to get through these people on my way back, all while spilling half the beer on my route.  If your a person who wants to down liquor and barely be able to hear the person next to you even if they are yelling directly in your ear, than this is the place for you.               - Can't hear a damn thing. It's like your in a coup with a bunch of drunk chickens all squaking.   This may be the place for you, but definately not for me."}
{"text":"I had a business lunch at CRAFT a couple weeks ago, and I must say the overall experience was outstanding. Not to mention the place was packed...  The service definitely gets a 5 out of 5. From the hostess to our server to the manager, everyone was polite and friendly. Our server was extemely knowledgeable. She was able to make recommendations and answer questions about the beer, despite having over 100 different beers on tap. One of my associates was ceiliac, but fortunately CRAFT has several gluten free options and our server knew exactly what he could and could not order without having to ask the kitchen.   The food is pretty decent as well. Just the care they put into the side salads (there's even nuts and strawberries on them!) exceeded my expectations. Most restaurants don't even have fresh green lettuce or decent vinegrettes. I've only heard to stay away from the poutine here.   If you're looking for a sports pub, this is not the place, but if you're looking for a place to go downtown with friends or for a business meetup with good food, good service, good specials and an unheard of beer selection, CRAFT is your place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as we had a voucher to use. Absolutely loved the layout! The beer selection is amazing and the service was great. I ordered the ribs and my husband ordered the brisket, at approximately $27 each we were expecting really amazing food. The dishes came out and they were absolutely tiny, barely any meat or sides. Extremely disappointing, I'm just glad I had a gift voucher and wasn't paying for it myself or I'd have been extremely annoyed. My husband said that most of his dish was sauce with very little meat. Overall it was a nice place with a good atmosphere just way too overpriced for what you receive."}
{"text":"Unfortunately despite all my years of drinking beer, taking beer tours, and even borrowing a 15 pound \"world of beers\" book from the library. Any knowledge I've gained about the universal brew is lost whenever I have that pint every night. You know, the one you promise would be your last but it isn't.  Craft...is a little expensive but on a Sunday they do have drink specials. However, I ignored all this and went hog-wild on their grapefruit ale, spaghetti meatballs, and beeramisu. The grapefruit ale was great but not very beer-ish (I still had my customary pint of Kieths aftewards). The spaghetti and meatballs were delicious- a great suggestion by our lovely waitress. And the beeramisu was interesting...I would honestly prefer a classic tiramisu.  Still I'd go back to check Craft out again. The service was great and I really like the space. CRAFT Beer is HUGE! I'd love to check this place out when it's brim full of people.  SOCIETY BECKONS!  22/30"}
{"text":"I've been a couple of times now, and not sure it sits with me. Food and beer are comparable to other places and the crowd is too one-sided. It's unfortunate, cause the actual venue is nice. Staff seems to be comprised of unhappy college students. There's a low energy vibe going for what has so much potential. It could be one of those cases where the britches are too big for the ..."}
{"text":"Have been back to Craft, a few times now. Service has been very good, and we enjoyed our meals. Will return again."}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed this place. Firstly I should tell you I read past reviews so the 4 times I have been here has only been lunch time on Sat or Sun, never gone on a busy night and after talking to a manager and finding out the capacity is 500 and they fill to 500 on Friday and Sat nights with most people just standing I'll stay away when it is busy.  The food was really great. I had the spicy tuna wrap and another night got the fish tacos. The sides are great. Yummy homemade mac and cheese (the really good kind with green peppers and onions) poutine, perfectly cooked McCain's plank cut yam fries (the best type of frozen yam fries on the market and better than most fresh homemade ones; they are crispy) that were perfectly cooked and seasoned with sea salt. The dessert was also excellent - I had the toffee pudding, sweet but not too sweet.  and I save the best for last: the beer. HUGE selection, most beers on tap of any bar in Canada. Many craft beers, and many really great promotions (such as the Belgium paddle with Stella, Hoegaarden, and Leffe for $7.25 and a free collector glass of one of those beers). I looked online and to buy a Leffe glass was $14+$20 shipping, so your basically being paid to drink by getting that special.   Oh and if your looking for a good local beer try Village Brewery, right here in Calgary Craft Beer Market is one of the few places with Village on tap. It's good. Think the Steamwhistle of Calgary.  Lastly I must say the marketing materials are great; the menus, magazine ads, transit signs are done beautifully with thought and detail. Read the footer of the menu for instance; they use little jokes and quotes to get their policies across.  It's nice to see a bar take pride in their marketing materials."}
{"text":"Typical pub food nothing special. It taste good and our server was very friendly. The tables are wayyyyy to close together. Great selection of beer!"}
{"text":"I've been to CRAFT a bunch of times now and I personally love it.   It's got an upscale pub vibe with an amazing beer selection. Even when the place is packed, the extreme ceiling height doesn't make it feel like it's crowded.   I've only been there for lunch or drinks, so I haven't tried a ton of the food. Although I have tried the Baja fish tacos and they were amazing. I wish that I could buy the CRAFT signature hot sauce.   At some point I'm going to have to try the 20 napkin burger, which is actually four 4oz patties topped with bacon and beer infused cheese. It sounds epic (read: giant). It even has a mini burger as a garnish..  I'm also interested to try the Crave seasonal beer infused cupcake for dessert. I have no idea what this would taste like, but it sounds interesting.  Here's the full menu: http://www.craftbeermarket.ca/our-food  They also have a beer club that I can't tell you about... It's the first rule of beer club.  http://www.craftbeermarket.ca/beer-club"}
{"text":"Craft, you've redeemed yourself!  I've been to Craft many times over the past several months, and have always had a great time.  Excellent beer selection, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with some people from out of town. I have to say, since this place opened up, it's service and quality has gotten much better.   I tried a couple beers, and ordered the Belgian six pack, 6 4oz sampler of Belgian beers. It was a nice variety of flavours, and a good deal.   Our waitress Brittany, was a doll. The place was packed, but she was always there when we needed her, and never took long with our drinks.   So, silence all you haters. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch as a group of six, and ended up spending a couple of hours due to the fantastic craft beer selection!  For lunch, most of us had the Mac n cheese, which was delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is very good, not over the top, but all you have to do is think about the name.... it's all about the beer. You won't find a better selection of beer period in Calgary. The 2 bar tenders I spoke with tonight we're very knowledgable about everything on tap, and beer in general. This my third time at this location, it has never disappointed."}
{"text":"I would only go here for happy hours. Smells like a high school kegger and the service you get is hit and miss. 9$ appetizers are good but local beer flight wasn't the best. Get the around the world beer flight. Wouldn't recommend to a friend. You can do better."}
{"text":"Went here during Stampede and it was packed! It has an awesome barn-feeling vibe with big industrial piping along the ceiling. How can you go wrong at a place with 100 beers on tap! I love the decor and atmosphere. It is a huge venue with a really unique menu! It was packed because of stampede and yet the service was still great and the food delicious. I can't wait to go back after stampede and see what it's like!"}
{"text":"Amazing time at Craft! The manager took us for a tour of the kegs after we told our server that we were from Ontario. He was super knowledgeable and kind and definitely made our night. If you want a beer served right, this is the place to go. Our server was also very knowledgeable and personable. I hope the best for this business because everyone working here really cared about customer service and took a lot of pride in their service and knowledge."}
{"text":"I know a few people in craft's beer club so I have tagged along as they try to epically taste a menu of 100 beers from Craft's taps.  I think Craft has done something IMPOSSIBLE - I found a beer I LOVE.  I'm not a beer drinker so I should preface that... at best I tolerate beer and would prefer to sip something else.  But anyway - I love me a beer called Fruitesse that they have on tap here.  The beer clubbers I was with don't really call Fruitesse a beer... it's a fruity Belgian beer that tastes nothing like beer... but it's still a beer I quite like.  (there are 2 packs of it presently in my fridge for me and not my guests kind of liking)   I don't tell you this story because of their non-beer tasting beer - I tell you this story because they have such amazing selections here there is likely something for everyone.  Food here is deliciousness.   Flat breads are darn tasty as are their pretzel sticks.  others at the table munched cheese burger sushi - which looked so cool I would have wanted to give that a shot if I wasn't a vegetarian.   My friend curses the day they took fish and chips off the menu (what pub does that?).  Service is good (they beer clubbers have a regular server which might help that a bit).  The venue is huge but loud.    All and all I quite like this place for the food... but the novelty of the taps would really speak to me if I loved my beer (and it does my friends for sure).

{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to CRAFT and would recommend it to any beer connoisseurs.  I had the Beer Flight (6 mini pints of the season) in order to taste a variety of beers. The Brew-master's selection of beers were delicious. I enjoyed each one and was happy to get to try so many different ones without paying an absurd amount. For my meal I had the fish tacos (on special for $2/taco) with a small side salad. I couldn't be happier with my true summer dinner. It was the perfect way to end a hot summer week.  The server we had at CRAFT was very diligent and provided excellent service. She was also very helpful for our beer questions and when we asked how many tacos we should order for a meal. I was surprised that we would receive such great service even though there wasn't an empty table in sight.  If you enjoy great beer and great food you'll have a hard time finding any place better than CRAFT."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS. FOR SURE. This place looks uber warehouse brewery pleasant. That is the highlight. The rest is better found almost anywhere else. The beer I sampled was not impressive. The food was no knockout. Both beer and food were excessively overpriced. The equivalent could be found in upscale Vancouver for 1/2 price. I know, I was there recently at a 'real' Craft establishment that was unbelievable in quality service and price. As for service, the lady who served us called the Super Bowl, the Stanley Cup. True Story. I do not say this of many places - but I wished I had spent my hard earned after-tax dollars somewhere else. If you are looking for fun/friends/pick-ups/push-ups/hook-ups/silicone & botox then by all means enjoy. I would rather find life somewhere else. Once you get the bill and if one is not too drunk, you will know what I mean. You decide."}
{"text":"Good Brunch. Bad Service. Went there for Fathers Day brunch. Had a reservation for 11:30 and was seated about 10 minutes later. Food was good. Our server Sabrina however was not. We ordered 3 flights of international beer and she brought us the local beer. When we asked her about it she said she rang in the wrong one and that was it. Not can I get you the correct one or an apology....nothing! We never drank the beer and she didn't take it off the bill either. Then at 12:45 she told us we would have to move as the table was reserved for 1 pm. Very tacky. They never told us that when we made the reservation or when we checked in with the hostess. That was very unprofessional ."}
{"text":"Well, I gave it another chance, and nope, the place is still hopeless. Still a giant wooden echoey cowshed, cheekily ambitious prices, and has that arrogant impersonal 'too big to not care' of a chain of businesses that get enough custom from the dumb herd that they feel they can do anything they please and charge what they want.  Alas, they get away with it, because enough people are stupid enough to tolerate it, or think this is 'normal'.  The owners also apparently run: 'Commonwealth Bar' a bar that's actually a club,  that leaves its customers queing outside in -30c weather being half empty inside, and then has the nerve to charge you to get into a glorified IKEA room set sprinkled with odd props that look like rejects from a Ripley's 'Believe it or not!'.  HiFi Club, A hipster haven I hear. Never been.  Una, the only bright spot in this cluster of painfully trendy venues.  Oh well. Another pub bites the dust, lets see if that new Jameson's 'Irish' pub is any better on 17th ave. After all, you can't open up a pub in Calgary without having some 'theme' now can you?"}
{"text":"Some coworkers from New Orleans were working with us in Calgary for a week, so as a farewell before they left, my local coworker suggested we take them to Craft.  Now I had only heard of this place and had never strayed in so it was new for me as well.  We stopped in on Good Friday around 7ish and the place was already packed with people.  As one of our American guests commented as he looked around \"There are more beautiful women in this bar than there are in all of Louisiana\" Agreed.    We stood at the bar enjoying a pint when my stomach looked up and started screaming in its squeaky voice \"Help meeeeee! Help meeeee!\" Fine.  Time for a bite.  I decided to have something light and satisfying and picked the crab cake sliders.  They were alright.  Unfortunately, this was definitely not fresh crab and the cakes were a bit on the dry side.  The saving grace was that it had a pretty good flavour beyond the crab itself.  I'll give it another try some other time and update, hopefully reflecting the positive reviews made by other people.  As for the beer selection, it's very impressive and worth trying a few, and the service is good."}
{"text":"First of all, the space is amazing. Has a sort of airy warehouse feel, and a fabulous bar.  They have La Chouffe on tap. Holla! My bf ordered Hoegaarden.  We ordered bacon cheeseburger sushi, wrapped in bacon! They had me at 'bacon!' It was delish. I ordered a southwest chicken salad of sorts. It was a huge portion, and quite yummy. My bf had a bacon cheeseburger and fries. Overall, food was tasty and prompt. Pretty decent variety.  We then ordered a Belgium sampler, which was a promo at the time. Good deal for 3 delicious samples and a free glass of your choice. We took the Hoegaarden at the server's suggestion.  Awesome place to watch sports. They had all three olympic channels on from every angle.  Service became a little slow towards the end, what with about 4 servers standing around at any given time, but overall an awesome experience."}
{"text":"I often end up at CRAFT for group events or work related things as they are really good at accommodating large groups. They have an upstairs area that can be sectioned off for private parties and there's some good spaces for large groups on the main floor as well. Since they are just a short walk from many of the office towers downtown they're well located for the downtown crowd. They have a great selection of beer, although I must have bad luck because they are usually out of my first or second choices and the food selection covers most of your typical bar fare, they also offer brunch which have tried as well and it's pretty good."}
{"text":"About 100 beers, a good portion are locally made.  They list ABV, but not IBU.  Limited cider and gluten free selections.  The service was friendly and they put up with our large group.  A-OK, 3-star."}
{"text":"Have been here few times already with large group of people; the food is just average and I am not expecting exceptional food as this place is more like a beer house; great selection of beer, fun and live atmosphere. The service has always been great, very good attitude by the staff."}
{"text":"Updating my rating... went for brunch today and experienced terrible service.  First off, shame on you, management. It's Remembrance Day and you're within blocks of two separate RD ceremonies on a Sunday, when people typically like to get brunch. Did you not think to put on an extra server or two for about 11am? Apparently not.  That said, after we were seated and received our waters, we'd picked out what we wanted to eat and drink but didn't see our server for another 20 minutes. Not even a drive-by to say \"Sorry, I'm swamped... I'll be right back.\" We had to ask the hostess, who was walking by, about where our server had gone.  When she did show up, we wanted to order our beers and meals but she wouldn't take the food order. So, it was another 20 minutes before we got our beer & close to an hour after we'd arrived before we finally got to order our food.   It wasn't THAT busy but the food took extraordinarily long to come out of the kitchen. The meals were, as expected, average. Would skip the sourdough toast in the future - dismal.  And, on our receipt, there was an extra charge for a side of toast. She took it off, but still...??? We certainly hadn't expected to spend 2+ hours getting brunch when we walked in.  Oh, and to top it off, they changed the channel in the middle of the CFL game so that 2 NFL games were showing instead. No, that's ok - we're only in Canada... wouldn't want to watch our own league.  The only reason why this isn't a one-star review is because we had a misunderstanding, which was a good part our fault, and she was very gracious about sending the meal back and rushing out the one that was originally supposed to be ordered.  If a group of friends want to go for drinks, I would consider coming. Otherwise, no plans on setting foot back into Craft. There are far better places.

{"text":"I was here once last summer for a friend's birthday and it was lots of fun! My second visit was yesterday, Easter Sunday, where my family and I attended for the Easter brunch buffet. 3 times a year Craft puts on a holiday brunch buffet (Easter, Mother & Father's Day).   It was fantastic!  Our server was super friendly and her coffee game was strong. Never let our cups drain to empty. That's the best thing a tired mom can get on Easter morning! Plus it was really good coffee!   The food was delicious and replenished before it could be empty. There was a wide variety of options, including vegetarian dishes, that spanned between breakfast and dinner choices. There was a carving station as well as an omelet station. A charcuterie table as well as a raw bar. Oh, and a dessert bar.   I liked it so much that I'm already booking my table for Mother's Day!   PS, check in and get a free high five from the bartender!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a few drinks and light food. Ordered a cider and found out after ordered that they were out. No big deal at all, I just ordered another drink. While waiting the manager came over and apologized for being out and offered to make me a drink that he said I'd love. He came back with a cocktail of ginger beer, grenadine and 7-up. It was amazing, delicious and completely unexpected. The service and attention to customers is top notch here, the servers are very attentive, drinks excellent and the food delicious. We had nachos - normally simple but everything was fresh, locally grown and just perfect. Definitely a top place to go downtown, if not all of Calgary!"}
{"text":"We really were not sure what to expect, but had heard positive feedback in the community about this place. We went around 6:30pm on a Saturday night, we're able to walk right in, grab a decent table on the pub side, albeit one of the few left, and get settled.   Immediately this place reminded me of the Yaletown Brewing Company in Vancouver. Love the warehousey type feel and the option to sit on the pub or restaurant side was a nice touch. Being more of a wine drinker than beer (well sometimes) I was pleased to see they had a small but decent wine offering on their menu. We were also enticed by the Beer Club (not that we get out much with small kids at home) and decided to join in the hopes we would get back there more often even for the occasional brew.   We grabbed some food...I had the appy size Baja Fish Tacos. Hubby had a Burger. Both were delicious. The selection of beers was extensive and we delighted in being able to try some new ones. Service was also great. In the end we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I can't give this place a 5 is because I tried one of their appetizers, the Mediterranean platter, and the falafel was not very good.  The hummus was very good.  In my opinion this should be a 4.5/5 only because it's a serious beer spot and I wouldn't expect exceptional food, although it would be a nice bonus.  The beer selection is very good!  They have over 100 taps and hey have great choices for almost any toe of beer you drink.  They also have a great balance between domestic and international beers.  The flights are only available in domestic and international.  It's a bit of a downer but I have been to other serious rap houses that will do the same thing.  In my opinion, I should be able to choose whatever beer I want in a flight and I should be charged the per ounce price for it.  The service is also very good.  We were sat pretty quickly and our beers got to the table relatively quickly.  We also had one of the managers check in with us to see if we were doing ok.  I was told to try their Caesar cocktail and I definitely don't regret it.  It was one of the best Caesars I've had!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is even slightly interested in beer.  My buddy also told me that hey have very nice private rooms for parties."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here tonight and it was great!  We came with our son and this place is completely family friendly.  The food ordered was the butternut squash ravioli, the beer can chicken, the TLT sandwich, the Yucatan chicken salad, and the kid's mac and cheese- there was not one complaint about any of these dishes- they were all delicious!  One member of our group, feeling a bit overwhelmed by all of their beer choices, asked the waitress to pick a local IPA.  The waitress asked several taste preference IPA questions and picked the perfect one!  This showed us that Craft Beer Market hires people who really love and know beer and care about taking care of their customers.  This is definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"This place is really big and a great way to spend an evening with a group of friends. It used to get too crowded and people had to line up in the street in very cold temperatures, but due to other businesses opening next door, that's not the case anymore  =) In my two experiences, the servers have always been professional and I have not been able to find anything wrong with the service!"}
{"text":"Another update...yet again. Unfortunately, it just keeps getting worse.  I was here last weekend for a friends birthday dinner. There were about 20 of us and my fiance and I were the first to arrive. The first server we had explained their policy about splitting bills - they were unable to do so with large parties but she assured us we would be able to each pay our tabs from the bill and it would come off the final total. We figured we would just order the same drinks throughout the course of the evening to avoid confusion and went on with our night.  During the course of our dinner, we had MANY different servers which made it extremely difficult to figure out who was taking care of us. After ordering, our food came out promptly which was great given our party size. I always love the Tuna Poke, but this time we did not get enough chips and the chunks of tuna & cucumber were WAY too big to be scooped up. My salad was quite delicious but the chicken looked to be of the pre-cut, deli variety.   Towards the end of the evening, we had a new server bring out the bill. I asked her if I could get a copy of it to see how much I owed so that we could pay for our items separately. She kept telling me that a guy from our table would cover the bill, and we could pay him directly. I told her that just wouldn't work for me, as I didn't even KNOW this guy, and I planned to pay with credit card - plus, the server before her told us we could pay for our items individually. She then told me to go to the ATM downstairs, she was \"way too busy\" to be processing \"20 different debit cards\" to pay for the meal. Ummm, excuse me? But that is what you deal with when you have a large party and a big bill (and therefore, an automatic gratuity). She was just being a HUGE bitch about it and I'm seriously SO DONE with giving Craft 2nd and 3rd chances when they keep royally screwing up. I'm sorry, but when the server wont even let me pay my own damn bill, I'm gonna be pissed off. Even writing this review has me boiling.  By the way, once the manager is back from appearing on Big Brother Canada 2, hopefully they keep him out of the kitchen. Otherwise, you can expect a disgusting amount of boogers in your food judging by the frequency in which he picks his nose."}
{"text":"Caveat: It's been open for less than one week as I write this, so it's early to judge this place.  I went to the Craft Beer Market for its Grand Opening on June 15.  It's in the old Mother Tucker's space on 12 ave and it has been successfully converted into a vast draft house.    The real draw is the great selection with 100+ beers on tap.  On opening night, most of the beers we requested weren't available yet which was pretty disappointing, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and time to work out the growing pains and see what's available next time.  And yeah, it took a long time to get a drink but the place was packed (opening night + game 7 of the stanley cup will do that) and the staff were doing their best.  This place is the opposite of intimate.  It's vast, open, and buzzing, but I would recommend it for groups or events.  I'm going to try it again in a month or two to see what the food is like and if they can maintain the beer selection they advertise.  Definitely worth checking out for the beer aficinados out there."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's rustic and retro, wide variety of beers on tap, food is sweet but they served it to me on a wooden shovel which was kinda' fucked up seeing though my burger leaked more juices than a weaved basket full of water. Still delicious tho'  My waitress was extremely kind and made sure I was always smiling regardless of the fact the Habs had lost to the Rangers which pissed me off, but thankfully I was buzzed enough from the sweet happy hour deals to keep me smiling.  All in all, awesome place. Don't order anything messy on the menu, and definitely go take a piss in the urinals regardless of your gender because they offer so much privacy you could probably bust a #3 and get away with it.  Cheers, Craft"}
{"text":"Went with a group of seven from work at lunch time. We were seated pretty promptly without a reservation, and were taken up to a large table on the second floor.  The food was pretty good, I had the appetizer fish tacos. The server, Kibby (?) was disinterested in our table of all young women, did not see if we wanted a second round of drinks or dessert, and failed to package up my colleague's mac and cheese 3/4 of which was left. She grabbed the plate, touched the garlic toast with her hands so it would not fall off the plate and whisked it away. For 24 bucks for a beer and a 1/4 of a plate of mac and cheese my colleague was choked, and when she asked where her takeout container was the waitress said she threw it out bc she thought it was not wanted. Perhaps a miscommunication, but I think she could have asked the question before tossing it, if she did not hear the request to take it home. Great functional interior, good food, rude service."}
{"text":"Loud, fun, good variety of drinks.  I got their flight (\"6 pack\") every beer was distinct and interesting. Loved it."}
{"text":"Love the refurbed warehouse open concept, but it is not well executed. Bad lighting, loud reverb, awkward seating, cigarette smoke wafting in... what a shame!   Same offerings as the Edmonton location and you can add to your beer 'passport' here as well (if it works, that is). The Calgary venue is larger (Edmonton's upstairs patio notwithstanding) but much less cozy and friendly. The two of us were seated upstairs at an awkward split table meant as a 6-top, where the lighting was terrible. Service was OK, but how frustrating is it for the servers and guests to have to yell to be heard and to repeat themselves? The cig smoke was annoying in a 'seriously what decade are we in' kinda way. Music was so loud at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday that we elected to stick to drinks and eat elsewhere. Then the NHL playoffs on TV were changed over to Entertainment Tonight, WTF? We were happy to get out.  Such a miss!! The Edmonton location does it better IMO. Great beer, great food, but crap ambience, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Such a popular place in downtown Calgary. This place is constantly packed! I love Craft, and I'm so happy they will soon be coming to Edmonton so I can enjoy the many many beers they have on tap! I love the rotating flights of beers you can order, and the food I've had here has been pretty good! The servers are always friendly, but there are definitely tons of people here so if you want a seat on a weekend evening you best get here early. This place fills up!"}
{"text":"Great Spot- In town for a conference and discovered Craft while wandering around. I had a flight of local brews with the best breakfast tacos I've had in a long time. Very personable staff , great experience overall."}
{"text":"Last Sunday morning, I phoned craft hoping to make a reso for 30 people for that evening. There was a group of us finishing up a course and we wanted to head out for dinner to celebrate. We decided on Craft because we figured they'd have the easiest time accommodating us thanks to their already gigantic space.  I phoned as soon as they opened, and was promised a phone call back as soon as they had a chance to see what staff they had on that day and whether or not they'd be able to accommodate a group our size for a reservation, or whether we'd just have to take our chances and walk in. A couple of hours later, they phoned me back saying they had called in an extra server just for our party and that we could have their private room for 7pm.  From start to finish, Craft did what they could to accommodate us. There was the odd mix up (my best friend ordered a burger on a gluten-free bun and it came out on a regular pretzel bun... but was fixed quickly after that), and with a group our size, sometimes it took a few moments longer for drinks to make their way to their respective drinker, but hey, one server for a group of 30 made same day? I'm impressed Craft pulled it off as well as they did. Thanks for taking such great care of us Krystal! I was impressed that they'd gone to the trouble of bringing in another server just for our group instead of just telling us they didn't have enough staff scheduled.  Sundays remain my preferred day to hang out at Craft. It's not overly busy, so you can still hear everyone. Pints that are regularly $5.95 are still on for $4 (all-day happy hour). And the burger I had this time round was plenty filling. I haven't tried brunch yet, but I might do that next!"}
{"text":"Craft is located on 10th Avenue in the SW, next door to National.  Street parking after 6 is free but it's usually hard to find.  Of course lucky me found a prime parking spot right in front of National! Otherwise, if you don't get as lucky as I do, you can park in the parkade across the street and pay.  My girlfriend Amanda wanted to have her birthday dinner at Craft so we arrived at about 6:15PM for drinks and food.  Amanda actually made reservations but when she arrived, her name wasn't on file so we got seated upstairs in the boonies...that is until they found a table downstairs for us a few minutes later which was nice.  We had a party of 6 that fit in the booth, ordered our drinks and shared a Crafty Platter which came with taquitos, wings (we chose honey garlic), pretzel bites, tortilla chips and salsa.  I don't recall what everyone ordered for their mains so I'll base this off my meal and drinks.  I ordered a big kid lemonade (pimm's, cucumber, lemon) which was ok...nothing like Pimm's cup from National.  Yeah yeah I know....go to Craft and don't get a beer..whatevs!! The platter was quite good, the taquitos were crispy and soft in the inside, wings weren't anything out of the ordinary wings, pretzel bites were ok, they're pretty much little dough balls and the tortilla chips are addicting, nothing special...just addicting.  It was a perfect platter for a party of 6 with some wings and chips left.  Everyone raved about the mac and cheese so I ordered that as a side.  To balance out my guilt of ordering the oven baked mac and cheese, I ordered a Kale salad as a main.  The baked mac and cheese was delicious! VERY rich, I couldnt finish the whole side.  I enjoyed the crusted cheese on top whcih added a different texture and the cheese IN the mac and cheese was yum.  My kale salad was MEH.  Chopped kale tossed in a light thyme vinagarette with some granny smith apples and toasted almonds.  I found that the taste was pretty bland...I mean I guess it is just kale salad but if there were more apples and dressing I would have enjoyed it more.   Oh! It also came with two garlic sticks which were alright.  Our waitress was really attentive at all times, taking glasses away, asking if we wanted other drinks etc. which we all appreciated very much.  We were one of the groups that stayed a while and it didn't seem to bother her.  As the night went on, of course CRAFT got busier and busier and the music got better.  SPICE GIRLS?! Ohhh yes....Stop right now ;)  I'd say CRAFT is a casual restaurant with fresh local food made in house, classic upbeat music....a place to chill with your friends, have some drinks and laugh.  The atmosphere is loud but fun!!  CRAFT has Canada's largest selection of draft beer with over 100 on tap!  Next time, I'll grab a beer."}
{"text":"I think Craft is in this weird spot between a normal bar and a nicer upscale restaurant that I just don't understand. Their menu consists of stuff that isn't as varied or good as what you could get in a restaurant but also not plain enough to be satisfying as bar food. I mean they don't even have things like fries or onion rings on the menu. They also don't have as many beer options as other fancier bars and a more limited wine selection that is worse than most restaurants. Their vegetarian options are limited but I have tried the flatbread, which wasn't very good. The beer float is not my thing either. Overall, their food is just ok and pretty pricey to boot. They also don't have any special beer that I know of which isn't available at other bars. Their check in offer is a free high five from a bartender, which sounds kinda dumb but I would have still used it had I not been too afraid to ask because everyone looked so surly. Honestly, I don't think I would ever pick Craft over National right next door."}
{"text":"I feel like I do have to agree with Peter A's statement a little bit, about the \"100 beers on tap thing\".A lot of my friends who are brewers themselves had forewarned me not to go to CRAFT Beer Market as it would suck my microbrew loving soul. However, I am glad that I was able to check it out myself. While I didn't get to try the food selection at CRAFT Beer Market, I did get to scan my beer menu and take my pick. I was happy to see so many pumpkin ales on the seasonal menu, and had a pint of Grizzly Paw's Jack O Lantern ale. It was pretty tasty, and tasted like autumn even though it feels like winter.  While they have good beers on tap, it is just kind of like they have picked up on the trend of craft beers and have commercialized it a little more. The atmosphere to me, is the weirdest. I felt like I'd rather be at the Hop in Brew or Wild Rose or another one of my favourite breweries elsewhere itself. This place is huuuuuge, and has this pseudo rustic construction I can't really wrap my head around. I'm super uncomfortable in this environment, as I'd love to be just cozy. The service was pretty friendly, but as this is a craaaaft beer establishment, I would rather talk to beer nerds with the time to chat about the offerings. While I really enjoyed my first visit due to the company, I don't think I'll be back to CRAFT unless peer pressured. I will be at a smaller, cozier pub drinking similar offerings or better, without being surrounded by twelve televisions.   (3/30!)"}
{"text":"Craft was a pit stop during a bachelorette party I attended this past weekend.  What a gong show.  As a thirty-something woman, I was grateful that at least half of the crowd consisted of my peers, but there's no need for mature adults to be shoulder to shoulder, yelling over loud music, fighting for service and spilled on without a hope of getting a seat.  The only reason we were here was because the doormen let us skip the line.  No one in our group would have waited to be a part of this circus.    I wanted to ask questions about the beer but it was just too busy to bother.  Service was slow.  We tried to get a breather from the crowd by standing on the upper floor, just to be patronized by the male staff.  They worked hard at kicking us out of that area and practically held our hands as we were lead downstairs and encouraged to put our names on a wait list for a table.  No thanks, I'd rather leave than wait yet again.    I would be thrilled about Craft if I were ten years younger and single.  I think that people watching is a big attraction here and it's easy to mingle because everyone's space is always being invaded.   If I knew exactly when there was no line-up and guaranteed seating, I'd dare to give it a second try.  Otherwise, forget it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday evening and was seated immediately. I ordered a root beer (off the tap), a kale caesar with chicken, and a butterscotch budino. After tip - my bill was $35! Definitely a lot more that I thought my meal would cost. While the salad was definitely tasty, the chicken was a bit over charred. The root beer was also okay, but I wouldn't get this again. Dessert was great, but a bit overpriced as it was essentially a pudding/custard priced at $9.  While the meal was enjoyable, I think the prices could be a bit cheaper, but this is just my opinion. Also, they were out of the cider on tap, yet didn't erase it from their board which had us get our hopes up only to find out they were out!  Seriously though - that salad was SO tasty! I highly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of garlic as the dressing was FULL of garlic and thyme."}
{"text":"Craft isn't great. I don't know. I don't think it's really fair to take every single domestic and \"import\" beer (you know, in the way that Keith's import)  widely available in the city, add a fancy bar, barn-like ceilings, and call brag that you have 100 beers on tap.   Just a generally silly place, I think. I did have some sort of sampler deal with 5/10 of their ciders. That was good, and I think fairly cheap coming in at around $7. My friends ordered their Margherita flatbread which was honestly just terrible. Like a big cracker soaked in salt water, slathered with ketchup.  Service was pretty good, but there is literally nothing to draw me back to Craft. Someone might have been able to clean up the bathrooms though. Would've been nice to have some soap for washing my hands so I didn't have to walk out to the bar and ask for some.  The bar did have a decent after-work crowd, probably hailing from Banker's Hall. Who cares? Not me. This place can't be around for very long."}
{"text":"This was the first place we went to when going through Calgary to get to Banff.  The service was the best part of the experience (which was a common theme in Canada).  The food was overall good - I had the fish tacos, which were good but the yam fries were great and I couldn't get enough.  I had a local brew that they served in a cute glass.  I collect brewery glasses from around the world. Long story, short - Lorry the day manager hooked me up.  Amazing!  I would have recommended this place before this gesture, but now I highly recommend going to a place that has good food and this level of customer service."}
{"text":"I just want to start this review off by saying, Lisa K is awesome! Probably the best bartender I have come across (and I have met a MILLION bartenders in my life!) She not only was friendly, helpful and constantly \"on it\", she went out of her way to teach us different methods of sampling different beers. She had us sample types and varieties of beers I have never heard of before, and then pair them with foods like blue cheese to change the flavour. It was incredible! I will most definitely be back next time I'm Stampedin' my heart out!"}
{"text":"This is just another overpriced beer hall with nothing unique to offer for food or drinks. The atmosphere is decent but thats probably the only positive thing I could say about craft."}
{"text":"CRAFT has a cozy atmosphere, attentive staff, and a fantastic selection of beers and food. The overall vibe is pretty laid-back (in a good way). Services are reasonable as well.  I came here late on a Monday night so there weren't many other customers at all; still, considering it was close to closing time, my bartender ensured that we were taken care of."}
{"text":"I Usually like this place but when I asked if I could have the rest of my beer the Bartender said \"nope\" and walked away. Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  This large downtown Calgary bar & party scene is not to be missed if passing through town.  It features an insanely large bar stocked to the gills with craft beer.  Did I say I'm a fan?  There are sizable eating areas elevated from the main floor on either side of the bar.  The menu includes typical bar fare, however I really enjoyed the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich.  It's not as good as Schwartz's Jewish Deli on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, but hey you're in Alberta!  If you like craft beer, I challenge you to talk to the bar tender.  Throw out a type of beer you like and drill down.  After about 5 distinct layers of options and types, you'll find a small treasure trove of delicious beers to choose from, of which you can't really go astray.  Lastly, but not least, there are few things as genuinely fun and pleasurable as an evening with the women and guys of Calgary.  Such a friendly vibe where new folks become fast friends and time passes way too quickly.  Enjoy your evening at Craft!"}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California and was in Calgary for the weekend working the UFC fight. I was cruising around and found this place. Awesome atmosphere and loved the open feel to the layout. I wasn't starving but ordered a Spinach Chicken Salad with a side of sweet potato fries...excellent choice. I ordered a few IPA's, the Big Rock and Rose...pretty good but being from a beer city like San Diego I wasn't too impressed.  Overall, the service was excellent and the waitress was extremely helpful deciding on what I should order. I would recommend this place if you want to bring a few friends, grab a beer and get some awesome food with plenty of people having fun around you. TV's were all playing sports programs, so I was super happy.  Cheers!  JB"}
{"text":"For a beer place the food is pretty good here. I've visited this location numerous times while in town on business and there are still some local Canadian beers I've yet to try.  While a majority of the beer they typically have in stock is readily accessible their draft selection is so large that unless you are trying to drink yourself into a coma you won't run out of unique options.  And my OCD completely loves their ability to server literally every beer in not only the proper glassware, but typically including the brewery's logo on it.  Makes for cool photos to stick on Untappd."}
{"text":"Cool ambience!!!... Good music!!.. A loooot of beers (even when I didn't try them, the menu has more than 100!!) ... The wine is ok, and the cocktails were not bad... I would definitely go back there.. I really liked the place and the music..."}
{"text":"having celiac makes enjoying a night out hard, but they were awesome here. several beers to choose from and the food was delicious. servers were very understanding and attentive, which was very appreciated"}
{"text":"Gave this place a shot last weekend on my latest trip to Calgary.   Seems like I have the same opinion as everyone else so far.  The place was packed, though they only had the main seating area open. The area on the west side was closed off. They had lots of staff working but they all seemed to be running around like crazy trying to keep up. They obviously have some kinks to work out to get a good system going between all of the staff.  Again, just like everyone else, not all of the beers were available. Because of the high ceilings I found the bar to be REALLY noisy."}
{"text":"We came here for Easter buffet, it was pretty good. They have everything from fruit to seafood. They have friendly waiters, and seafood is really great they had smoke salmon and fresh oysters. They also have really good fried chicken and mac and cheese. Also very good bacon, omelets, sausages and lots of other great brunch options. Totally recommend there Easter buffet."}
{"text":"What a great place! Kind of a training ground for staff! The managers seem to sit at the bar after their shift which seems the norm! Bar staff are good! But under the direction of drinking bar managers! The food is great and good timing bit there seems to be no real order! A restaurant can run but the staff know how to hold it together but don't know how to run it! Train the staff to run the responsibility so you don't have to manage as much because that's not working! It's not that busy here on a good Friday! Why make more work when you can train staff to do their jobs! The bar is great! They know their beers and do great times! Food is on time too! Bar is now really awesome on all their service! So with all the beer selection great food you need to come here and enjoy the get service"}
{"text":"Beer and mellow vibe. The place is huge and fairly emptied when we came.   They have beers and cocktails. The beer was pretty tasty, I think I got one of their IPAs. We also ordered the cookies and ice cream dessert. Cookie was kind of hard but ice cream was good! Yum!"}
{"text":"The beau and I ventured in here to see if we could secure a table for eight on a Friday evening.  Luckily, they had room for us upstairs.  As we waited for the rest of our party to show up, we put down a couple of beer.  (Americans, notice that Canadians do not pluralize beers.  If you do, you'll look like a cluelessYank...like me...)  I had a lot of fun going through the extensive beer list.  Who knew Canadians made decent beer?  About 45 minutes later, our party showed up and we enjoyed chatting over several more rounds.  One downside, the music got progressively louder the later it got and I had to limit our conversations to the people sitting right next to me.  Lame.  We didn't eat anything so I have nothing to say on that (although I did see a massive platter of nachos that seemed intriquing).  I will remark on the chic, industrial decor of this establishment.  The exposed brick and large factory-like windows create a very casual and hip ambiance."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot. Lots of TVs around for everyone to watch the game and the food is pretty good as well. Really friendly service. I'll admit that I didn't have any alcohol when I went here so I can't really speak for the beer but everything else was good. The classic burger isn't on the level of great but it's okay. The mac and cheese is awesome though.  + Friendly service + Good wait time  Can't think of any real cons besides the noise level being really loud, but that's what happens when you pack a ton of tables into tight spaces and combine that with beer and sports games. Pricing is moderate and appropriate for the food you're getting. I'd probably come back just for the mac and cheese honestly, haha."}
{"text":"A place you can totally count on that will deliver every time.   I stopped by here with some colleagues after a conference for some eats and drinks.  A few of us had flights.  The local flight was nice to get to sample some local brews.  The around the world flights were not very around the world when we were there.  There was a Belgian and an Irish, the rest were from BC.  Food wise, their ravioli was to die for and their kale salad was great.   Defo order the fried pickles!!!  So delicious even tho I am not a pickle lover, I enjoyed it very much.  Nachos a bit pricey (so is most of everything else) but that's how it is at a bar.  Have a Guinness float or a fruli float to cap off your night.  Best idea ever!"}
{"text":"Today I met my Dad downtown for lunch. I recently started working just down from Craft and it's been a while since I've been there for a meal. I've frequented the Edmonton location, but not ours.  ANYway, the server was friendly, they sat us fast and all of the service was great! Nice people and quick! So it's a great place to go when you have a lunch deadline.  I  ordered the fish tacos, gluten free. And they were great! Nice and spicy AND the shell (which for GF folks is a corn tortilla) was NOT SOGGY! This is amazing and rare. So big ups to that.   On the the side I ordered a spinach salad sans pecans, which was a bit sweet for my taste but still good and fresh.  All in all, it's a great places with TONNES of gluten free and vegetarian options to choose from. And if you have to get back to work, we could have been in and out in an hour no problem.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about a great selection of beers from all-over. Truly a beer connoisseurs place to check-out and Craft Beer Market is a go-to place when my friends from up-north are in town for business.   We have been long-time patrons of the Craft Beer Market (since it opened actually) and generally we come away with smiles. You can always find a photo on Instagram from one of us after every visit.  I wouldn't recommend going here on the weekend if you want a casual social experience with friends (or business clients) because it gets loud and crowded. You will find yourself yelling over the music and other yelling people. Save that casual social experience for a week day or night unless you are looking for the loud and proud night out - then Friday is great! Woo hoo!   The menu is well... PUB FOOD. But it is higher up in the quality pub food chain and they do purchase some local ingredients, which is a selling point for us. Hopefully, they can make it 100% local sources at some point.   Since you are wondering, we've always been satisfied with the food (not a crumb left on the plates). One of my friends is on a special diet and always finds something to eat. Another friend has a couple food allergies and the kitchen always customizes something for him. Good job Kitchen folks!   Glad to see a good pub doing well.  Thanks Craft!  ~Shane"}
{"text":"This review only addresses the beer, the staff, and the ambiance. We didn't order any food so can't comment on it.  Fantastic selection of beers on tap, well split between European imports and local/regional craft beer, with a healthy sprinkling of American craft beer. We sat at the bar and ended up chatting with Ernie, one of two cicerones. He recommended several beers and all of a sudden samples were piling up in front of us. He was super knowledgeable about the beer the bar served and we both opted to order quite a few pints of many of his recommendations. Other staff were also really friendly and helpful. Such a great experience. This will be the first bar I head to next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised that this place doesn't have 4 or  5 stars! The food was amazing!! Had the butternut squash ravioli, I am still craving it. The hubby had some kind of chicken cooked in a beer can and he loved it. Now I'm only giving this place 5 stars because of how good the food was it made up for the long wait time for drinks and the alright service"}
{"text":"Despite the fact I sometimes feel that Craft is a corporate experiment designed to \"dupe\" me into liking it,  Despite the fact it is OFTEN crowded, loud and hard to find a seat,  I have to say, I'm a fan!  The beer selection is pretty dang good, but with 100+ beers on tap, some are bound to run out from time to time. Like the Rolling Stones said, \"You can't always get what you want.\"  The last time I visited, I was surprised that the food is actually pretty dang good as well! The fish tacos are quite delicious; fresh and tasty with a nice amount of spice. I also had some of the flatbread pizza which is also quite good.  My final insight of positivity, which tips the scale in the above-average realm of the spectrum, is in regard to the specials. Throughout the week, as well as various times during happy hour, you can get some great deals on food AND beer. They have a variety of \"specials\" on certain nights and occasional special events.  Overall, I would not wait in a huge line to get into Craft, but I am certain I will visit from time to time when craving some tasty bar bites and some highfalutin beer."}
{"text":"Overall a great spot for dinner in Calgary. Full bar, hundreds of beers, veggie options and meat too -- if you are feeling extra wild, order the ice cream cookie dessert.   Seating upstairs is more laid back, above the fray, with plenty of tables for larger groups. The nacho barrel is a huge appetizer  and a favorite of Marco."}
{"text":"A group of us went in on a Sunday evening for post conference bevies and dinner.  There was a solid crowd which is always a great sign. The atmosphere is def uptown hipster with lots of exposed pipes and a draft selection that will meet the needs of the trendiest of cool kids.  The menu is large enough to offer variety without going in too many directions.  Pasta, pizza, apps, burgers but all with a modern twist.   I enjoyed the bacon mac n cheese-lots of both bacon and cheddar and plenty leftover for lunch      Our larger group was well served by friendly wait staff.  I would go back again especially with a group!"}
{"text":"Beware, the sign says $4 beers, but when you order, your server doesn't warn you that the beer you think you are ordering for $4 is really $8.  A very limited selection is $4. And, it's not even a full English pint.  You need to be proactive here and ask specifically what is on special. Overpriced, crowded and so-so service."}
{"text":"We attended Caskapalooza at CRAFT and had a wonderful time! The beer was flavourful and the company great too! The food on the menu at CRAFT is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"In theory, Craft should be amazing.   I love the oodles of craft beer that are difficult to find elsewhere, let alone on TAP.      Unfortunately, they have NO identity and have decided to mix craft beer with the terrible typical Calgary club scene.   Playing awful music, cramming too many people inside, and having downright atrocious service.  If they had stuck with just being an awesome joint for getting a new craft beer, and creating a laid-back atmosphere this wouldn't mix in with the other 50+ crappy line-up-outside-the-door-on-a-friday-night joints.    They've really blown their potential and its super disappointing.  I actually avoid going there and would rather just get my craft beer from Co-Op Liquor stores.  That way I can get SOME service."}
{"text":"Am surprised by the low reviews. My experience was fairly good. We avoided a 45 min wait by eating at the bar and our bartender was excellent! There was a problem with our champagne being flat a couple times but she made sure to keep trying until we were satisfied. The ambiance is hipster, nice decor, I really like the hanging air plants.   We ordered the mussels and sausage which was excellent and plentiful for the price. The market fish was a bit pricey for the portion, but was still very flavorful. The one tortellini that accompanied it was very good.   Overall, I recommend if you don't mind spending a little more for good gourmet \"locally sourced\" food."}
