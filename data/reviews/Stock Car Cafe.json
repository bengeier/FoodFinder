{"text":"Terrible service today. We sat there for 25 minutes only to find out they just started our meal. Three other tables received food after  they sat down after us. And yes they ordered the same meal, a burger. When I asked the waitress she told me another 9 minutes with no apologies and only excuses. She had no answer when I referenced the other three tables.

I travel through Charlotte airport a good bit and will never stop there again."}
{"text":"Terrible service at the bar!! Grabbing a quick drink during a layover turned into a bit of a production. Dirty glass, mixed up order and a lot of attitude from our server - Brian. 

Maybe it's because it was almost closing time (around 10 PM), or because the people working their just hate their jobs, but it seems like everyone who dared to make an order was getting a nasty attitude from the servers behind the bar.

Avoiding this place is hard due to the lack of options, but I'd def not go there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible....rude waitress, glasses were dirty, and the food was very plain."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for drinks on our way to 10th anniversary in Barbados and had an great experience here. The waitress Alexis was amazing.  Hats off to her for her excellent service and great attitude."}
{"text":"By far the worst airport food I have ever had. This is the South. If you are going to serve grits, they had better be halfway decent. These tasted like they had been scorched or they tried to thicken them with peanut butter. It's been a long time since I've sent something back, but I did. They gave me a breakfast sandwich instead which was marginal for being over $10.

Steer clear."}
{"text":"DO NO GO HERE
Beer does not have price on menu. Thus, they secretly charge you $10 per warm beer.
Waiter was rude and had to search for someone to get my check from."}
{"text":"Breakfast at 7am . Rubber eggs, cold potatoes, cold unbuttered toast, average coffee, poor service."}
{"text":"The WORST service of any restaurant I've ever been to ever. The place was mostly empty and I waited 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by waitstaff, and then another 10 minutes just to get a water. Usually, I'm patient, but this is the airport. Things have to move a little quicker than waiting 20 minutes for just a drink. And the food...negative. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Bojangles."}
{"text":"Landed in Charlotte for a lay-over. It was a bit late (maybe 9:15pm) and I'm guessing their kitchen closes around 10pm. We ordered 2 beers, 2 shots of whiskey, a burger, a chicken sandwich, and 2 more shots of whiskey. Drinks came out quickly- our server Brice was super friendly and funny even though we could tell he was busy. Was a little sad when we noticed our whiskey shots were only about 1oz pours. For the amount they charge and the size of the drink, I really hate to say, it was a rip-off. We both work at/run bars in a city and the cost of 1 shot of Jameson for that size is less than $1. I get it- you've got to mark up prices to pay the bills...but I think if it was even a 1.25-1.5oz pour we would have been psyched. Then my chicken sandwich came out completely raw in the center. He saw us notice right away and took it to the kitchen to get a new one made- unfortunately, we had a flight to catch. I asked for a side salad since we didn't have time. He was super nice and accommodating about everything, it was just unfortunate that the kitchen didn't cut into the chicken to check that it was cooked. Would possibly give this place another shot if we ended up here, but I wasn't psyched that the bill was still $75ish. #airportlife"}
{"text":"This was a quick dinner pit stop during work travel. So personal disclaimer - I totally misread the sign and name. I thought I was walking into Rock Star Cafe. Don't ask why! I'm sure you can imagine my confusion when from the first second I was overwhelmed with the excruciatingly obvious NASCAR paraphernalia. I asked a server why a Rock Star Cafe would have so much NASCAR stuff. He stared at me oddly and pointedly handed me a menu. My co-worker had a nice laugh over my mistake. Thank you ladies and gents I'll be here all week!

So a few things, the food is not impressive but it's a better option than airport fast food. I ordered a bun-less veggie burger. It was not the best but certainly not the worst. Service is SUPER slow. We almost missed our boarding while waiting for the check to come out. Wait staff is mostly friendly but always looking frazzled. I didn't get that. They weren't that busy! My summarized assessment - Meh. Overwhelmed with the NASCAR shrine and underwhelmed with food. But then again that's work travel at it's finest!"}
{"text":"So delicious. Our waitress, Alexis, was adorable and seemed genuinely happy to help us out. Food was tasty; nothing remarkably above airport fare. But wow, how nice to see a smiling face while travelling! Thank you, Alexis!"}
{"text":"Worst bloody Mary ever in my whole life at this particular restaurant it is like Campbell's tomato soup with too much spice \"horrible \"
I recommend not getting a bloody Mary at this location unless you want to vomit

Worse salad in my life ever had anywhere on the planet worst tacos ever I've ever had anywhere on the planet"}
{"text":"Sat down....at the bar, no eye contact for 10min, then I ordered a drink and a salad....\"Do you have 10 min to wait\"?   Not really interested in serving anything."}
{"text":"I fly about 40 times per year and see many airports. About half of those flights stop over at Charlotte and I get to eat there many times. As airports eateries go (and I see many worldwide, not just the US), this is one of the good ones. Good food at a fair (for an airport) price."}
{"text":"Tables dirty, employees talking, too long to come to the table, mediocre food. Won't go there ever again."}
{"text":"I wanted to leave, but i met the waiter \"Brice\" 
He's the nicest most polite waiter I've had the fortune to meet. The food is average, but his service made me like it. I ended up staying 2 hours. Thank you Brice!"}
{"text":"This place was nasty!  I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich ($7.49) it tasted like shit.  The onion rings were crappy too.  My friend ordered the Butterfly Shrimp ($11.99) it had no flavor.  The Ginger Ale was flat.  The service sucked.  The bill came out to be $23.57!  That cost way too much money for such shitty food.  Never again!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and when I leave I vow I won't come back. Sadly I am a captive patron as the only thing this place has going for it is location. The servers are slow and inattentive. Not just mine but I see other patrons shaking their heads while trying to flag down the staff to get some attention. The food is plain but with the added bonus of airport pricing."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 3-4 stars if not getting sick from eating here.  The service was attentive and nice and the food was decent for being in an airport.  The problem I have is in the middle of the night getting sick for a couple hours and this was the only thing that I had eaten.  They need to check their beef, eggs, cheese, and produce as I am in the restaurant business and who knows if those things were chilled and kept properly.  Very disappointing and not a fun way to finish my Christmas."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!  

Walked in and saw the waitress cleaning off a table and asked if I could sit there.  She tells me that it's fine then walks off.  She never came back to wipe the table down or bring me a menu.  Another waitress walked by and I asked her if I could get a menu and she tells me that my waitress should bring me one.  

Long story short...
-- took forever for my table to be cleaned off and a menu brought to me
-- took forever the waitress to return to take my order 
-- too almost forever for the food to come out
-- the food was decent (pork sliders)
-- the waitress never returned.  I had to walk around the restaurant to find someone so I could pay.

Never ever coming back here!"}
{"text":"Food ? Meh....
Service ? Horrible. Server Karen RUDE & MISERABLE as hell.
Bad day or just a bitch ?"}
{"text":"Mediocre way overpriced food. The only saving grace was they had tater tots.  Due to construction it is about the only choice open on that concourse currently and give limited time it was what we were stuck with. Next time I'd skip lunch."}
{"text":"I had the Pace Car burger and it was good.  I had it within minutes of my order being put it - I swear they have retired pit crew workers back there.  However, the service to clear the table and give me my check left something to be desired.  I understood that my server was VERY busy, and I don't blame her, but they were understaffed and mgmt may need to reevaluate their scheduling.  Especially when they are serving people that need to catch a flight - if someone was waiting too long and heard their boarding starting, they might just leave..."}
{"text":"It's possible they have good dishes but nachos isn't one of them. Worst excuse for nachos I ever had.  Also the waiter I had was horrible.  He took my order and never stopped again at my table until an hour later when I called to him to bring the bill (someone from the kitchen brought the food).  I'm really sad I gave him a 42 cent tip because it was 42 cents more than he was worth but I didn't have exact cash and there was no way I was going to hand over a credit card and wait another hour.  The tip I wanted to give him was to quit being a waiter."}
{"text":"Expensive, but expected in an airport. The turkey avocado sandwich was great with the tater tots as a side."}
{"text":"Considering this is \"Airport Food\", it is average. Service a little above average. Business practices, questionable. On reviewing my credit card statement, I have discovered I have been \"double charged\"  Tried to call location using telephone number provided on website (704) 359 4910, no answer. Contesting charge with Visa."}
{"text":"Just try the Guacamole. I had a chicken quesadilla and the Guac made the meal!"}
{"text":"It's an airport restaurant. I rate it with that understanding. 

Service was prompt and food was fast, freshly cooked and hot. Coffee left a lot to be desired, as did their lack of salt on their food, but the prices and volume of food was a nice surprise in an airport establishment."}
{"text":"On a layover from Europe to DFW, we stopped for a quick drink and a lite meal.  We each ordered a cocktail, which the menu did not list prices.  Dumb me...I assumed that the price would be in line with other restaurants.  The drinks were in tall, thin glasses...loaded with ice.  The total volume was about 12oz. (I own an Italian restaurant).  When we got the bill, I was shocked!  $31 for two small drinks, loaded with ice.  The server and the manager apologized that the prices were not listed, as they get a lot of complaints.  Rightfully so!!  I would be ashamed and embarrassed to do that to my customers.  Never again will I darken their door.  The owner of that establishment should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I found this place when going home from Charlotte 3 yrs ago. The BBQ sandwich I had was the bomb. I was happy to see that the restaurant was still there yesterday!  The BBQ sandwich was STILL the bomb AND Naomi was a great bartender!"}
{"text":"ALRIGHT WHAT THE EFF WAS THAT \"TO-GO\" CONTAINER? SERIOUSLY (OK end cap lock now..) a friggen styrofoam plate with a plastic thing over it THAT DIDN'T EVEN FIT IT WHOAMYGAWSH how the hell am I supposed to \"travel\" with this \"to-go\" container.. here I am thinking when I left the place to walk to my gate that it would stay together.. intact.... HA WHAT A JOKE.  I ended up scarfing down my salad FROM THE PLASTIC BAG.

The salad was really good to be fair (tomato basil dressing on buff chix, yum), BUT SERIOUSLY INVEST IN REAL \"TO-GO\" CONTAINERS PEOPLE IT'S 2011 ALREADY JEZIZ."}
{"text":"Where's the zero stars rating?  Just ridiculous - busy day,  granted - but this place employs an ill-advised seat yourself policy - and it goes downhill from there.  Chickens with their heads cut off doesn't begin to describe the service (or lack thereof) in this place.  After waiting 15 minutes to catch somebody's eye,  I then waited another 10 minutes before I realized I'm probably not going to get served - ever.  So I approached my waiter at the service bar to ask if the glass of wine sitting there for 10 minutes might be mine.  He said he had no idea since I want sitting in his section (rather indignantly). I acknowledged I might not be in his section,  but he took my order - to which he responded (almost unbelievably) no,  he didn't.  I drank my wine,  forgot my food and beelined for the exit at my first opportunity. Save yourself the pain - find somewhere - anywhere - else to eat."}
{"text":"Worse service in Charlotte and Racist Ass old Waitress who only was short with me from the beginning ! Manager was nice and accompanying and professional unlike this OLD should have retired years ago waitress name I did not catch cause I asked for another. Food was good and the rest of staff was just this one lady who Did not change my feeling of Charlotte which I was here for a week were great!! This one lady unfortunately played my pre conceived notions of racist south but the rest of the great people I met in Charlotte were great. Too bad people like this lady still exist and reason why this place is getting only 3 stars !  Funny Thing is I tipped big to the 2nd waitress as I always do so at-least I could teach the racist with monetary loss"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on my layover with about an hour to spare.  There are not a lot of options on Concourse B, so I stepped into this place ( in order to eat near my gate) 

Good service.  Nice waiter.  I ordered a sprite and a roast beef sandwich with fries.  I. Thought that the food was quite good and would have no problem stepping I here again on a layover."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a bite since I had an hour plus lay over and the gate was really crowded. Service wasn't bad although not very personable but I'm sure they get really busy and probably good tips so it could be blamed to both that and some complacent mindset by staff that work longs hours in the airport. But what matters most is the food right?? Wth I ordered just plain ole burger with cheese, extra charge of course, who does this these days. Clearly marked up prices for it being inside the airport But still tons better than going into the fast food fare that most your gates have. Burger tasted good and the steak fries fit the crave I was having for a late lunch. Not a bad experience but also nothing special that would demand a repeat visit if given different choices."}
{"text":"Very good service, good food, above the airport average.

Jamara Ray served me and she was on top it: quick to take my order, knowledgeable about the menu and authentically friendly. What impressed me most was that I didn't have to ask for anything and she anticipated me needing my bill at the right time.

I had chili and salad. Chili with generous amounts of cheese and sour cream; salad was fresh. 

Stock car racing theme is kind'a fun, too."}
{"text":"Omg! 31 bucks for a drink and chicken strips?!?!? This is ridiculous! For real! I know that airport food is pricey but when your drink is more than food, that's a problem! 

Haven't tried the food yet. Sorry. Will update later"}
{"text":"We had a long layover in Charlotte and we were looking to place to watch the Steelers play. We picked this restaurant because it had burgers. 
It was dead yourself so we were able to pick a good spot by the tv. Our server promptly came to get our orders. He was very nice and very down to earth. 
Everyone order the steak burger and I got wings. The burger was cooked exactly they way everyone preferred. My wings were super yummy. I got the dry rub with Carolina bbq sauce on the side. The burgers came with fries as well. 
It was better than we expected . It was a little pricey because it's an airport but we would absolutely come back here if we are stranded at that airport again! 
If you have a few minutes to stop and eat , I suggest it"}
{"text":"This is a cool little bar inside the airport.  The staff is super friendly.  They have a decent beer selection.  I'm reading some people think their prices are too high.  I paid $9 for a beer but its was 22oz.  Not a bad price and you have to figure, they are paying premium lease space for having a cafe/bar in the airport that gets a lot of foot traffic.  I didn't eat here but if I ever go back to Charlotte, I would sip a brew here again."}
{"text":"I've been here before for a dash and go burger.  Ok product.  I came back knowing what to expect with regards to food product.  What was disappointing was the service.  Not only with my waitress, but just watching the staff as a whole.  Put a smile on your face.  We're the customer.  We want to be treated nicely.  We don't need rude self serving wait staff.  

I will say the two bartenders were smiling and their customers appeared much happier.  I wish I sat at the bar.

Classic burger was fine.  Not great.  Order came quickly thought the tots were cold.

Not my first choice when I fly through Charlotte next."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Charlotte on our way home from vacation. Even being in 50* weather in January was not impressive as we had just left 89* weather. That being said - after a crazy rush off the plan - through customs - rechecking our baggage - TSA again, we were finally free for dinner. We picked the Stock Car Cafe as it was the restaurant that was the least busy and had a good menu. I had the Chop Salad which included a whole chicken breast, hard boiled egg, cheese & bacon. It was a good size salad and filling. The waitress was minimally attentitve as she was often running to other outlets across the hall or next door. It wasn't disruptive to our service but lead to slow service overall.  Hubby had Two Chicken Breasts smothered in cheese, BBQ sauce and bacon. Coleslaw and Beans on the side. He said that it was good but not amazing. (Note- our standards for food were low and I could be scoring higher as our last meal was 13 hours and 2 timezones ago.) If you have time to kill and are looking for food but not a personal connection or any sort of personality this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Charlotte so we stopped here for some food because we were not feeling the food court. We ordered the pork cheese nachos and the chicken tenders with fries. The portion for the cheese nachos was so big that we couldn't finish it. The pork was kinda dry to me, but my boyfriend liked it. The chicken tenders were soft and somewhat juicy. The servers were very friendly and nice and kept coming to refill our waters and see what else we needed."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. The food was bad, and the service was worse. Our server seemed like he had taken a little too much Xanax. Wandered away after taking my payment and when he returned looked blankly at the ceiling before turning around multiple times. This may be a halfway house rehab employer or something."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I ordered a basic cheeseburger with tater tots.  Burger was okay. Tots were reheated. Yuck.   I'd recommend you try something else..."}
{"text":"When you're at the airport you only have so many choices...the food was okay, service was good, and it was a comfy place to hang out between flights. If you're a racing fan, you'll enjoy the memorabilia."}
{"text":"Negative stars should be possible to describe this place. The waiter Bryce asked me why I picked a particular seat when it was clear this section was busier than others and said it's 'annoying' that I did that. He then proceeded to throw a set of silverware at the table. Look- I get it. Guy was probably having a stressful day at work but other people have stuff going on in their lives too and that's never an excuse to treat others disrespectfully. It was simply unacceptable. 
I decided to leave and while walking out noticed some very questionable hand hygiene practices by the staff. If you have any other option, do not go here."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for a morning drink before we catch our flight to New Orleans. Not sure why there's bad review. Our waitress was wonderful. My drink was awesome. And my truffle fries was great to help with my drink. She has us walking out with water., check on us numerous times. Everything was prompt and we manage to catch our flight on time. So not complaints here!"}
{"text":"Really Horrible. Slooooooooooow service.  The staff is too busy playing grab-ask in the kitchen. Took 50 minutes for a burger and fries on a Tuesday afternoon with only five people at tables. Burger was over cooked... burnt on the bottom, and fries were cold. But this was expected with the cooks and waitresses all standing around at the bar gossiping rather than cooking and serving. DO NOT EAT HERE.  And right now, while I'm typing this, the cook and two waitresses are singing the song on the music speaker, out loud in the middle of the restaurant, like they are on America's Got Tallent!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. If you want to spend $14 (with beverage) for scorched scrambled eggs, warm (not toasted) multi-grain toast (only choice), and hash non-browns, then this is your spot!  And if you're having tea, a refill consists of just more hot water for your original teabag. At least the bacon came OK."}
{"text":"I had the best breakfast, Charlotte Start with cheese grits! Yummy. George my waiter was funny fast and efficient! Thank you for the great recommendation for the Cheese grits I loved them. Great meal before a long 5 hour flight home. Make a pit stop here. You will be happy you did and day hi to my new friend George for me."}
{"text":"The service was great, a bit slow but the politeness makes up for the speed I guess. I had the burger, which is supposed to be made with good quality meat. However I am unsure as to how they made it this bland. The streak fries were okay. The menu was very limited and judging by the decor and the design of the restaurant I was expecting a lot more. I've had good airport food, it does exist but sometimes looks can be deceiving."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a layover to Toronto. 

TERRIBLE SERVICE 

KEISHA was my waitress. 

1. She comes by after I sit and doesn't say a single word to me. She just drops the menu on the table which had a random fork and water on it. I asked her to please wipe the table and give me a dry menu. She does it and says nothing. I say thank you. She walks away and says nothing. 

Decided not to jump to conclusions and wait to be served. 

2. She didn't check up on me once. She made sure to check up on the people behind me that she has to walk PAST me to check up on but not me. 

3.  Never asked if I wanted another beer or drink. Just brought me the bill. Didn't ask if I even wanted the bill. As if to say \"bye bitch\".  Then immediately asks the man to my right if he wants another beer. Just so happens I was the only black woman there. Why does everyone else get the royal treatment? 

I'm so disgusted I will be contacting them. I tipped her and actually walked back and scratched her tip out ! I couldn't live with myself if I gave her a penny!!! 

 Food wise - the classic burger was ok but that burnt bacon I added ruined it. Lol."}
{"text":"Cool looking but Basic airport fare... And frankly to expensive. Find other options in the airport.

cheers
Steve"}
{"text":"Slow service. Mediocre food. Stopped in to catch the game and dinner. Waitress popped right over. I told her I needed a few minutes as I had just hiked from the other end of airport. To be fair, she brought water and came right back. I ordered and pretty much never saw her again. Well, I did see her, but she was always talking to some guy. Who actually looked like the manager, but was of absolutely no help, despite my staring at them both trying to get their attention. I ordered the nachos and the chips were stale so I was trying to get their attention to get some fresh ones. Never again."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick lunch.  The place was empty. We ordered sandwiches and one drink and the price was $20.00 and the food came out pretty quick. My BBQ sandwich was so soggy that I could not eat the bun.  We told the waitress we need our bill because our plane was boarding and had our receipt with in minutes. Would I eat here again- No but when your in a pinch it wasn't bad- get the tater tots!!"}
{"text":"Although the food was good, it all went south due to a salt shaker! Mine at table, so asked Hostess who grabbed one from other table. Fine! Began salting my Tots, but no salt! Tapped with my knife, but no salt. Opened top and found solid block of salt inside! Set shaker at edge of table and hostess passed by several (8) times w/o seeing to it. Finally, she stopped to ask if all was well. I told her no and motioned toward the shaker. She checked it and immediately said. \"It's not my fault!\" She then took it and said she would fix it, but didn't return for several minutes.  By that time I was near finished my meal and pressed the button to pay. More minutes passed and she came to ask if I wanted a refill. I told her no, that I had pressed the button to pay and go. Phew!!! A good meal torpedoed by a salt shaker! If only she hadn't said it wasn't her fault, but simply replaced the shaker in a timely manner! She never did get the salt shaker back to me. Oh well, it probably  saved me a few unneeded calories!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner before a connecting flight to Nashville. No frills place. Ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was alright. Pretty big portion and lots of blue cheese. Only downside was the fries which were cold and definitely not seasoned like it says on the menu. Service was friendly if not a lil absent. Would prolly eat here again."}
{"text":"As every other story about this place on yelp, I had a layover in Charlotte.........

Ok. Cliche beginning out of the way. 

Came in here for a ice cold Budweiser (or two) and decided to munch on some nachos while watching sports watched by everyone other than us Southerners, i.e. Hockey, soccer, Formula One racing.

Anyhow, should have read about the nachos before ordering. This was a bastardized version that I had never seen before. Tortilla chips, salsa, jalapeños, sour cream, and pulled pork.

I said, pulled pork.

Now......being from North Carolina, nothing I love better than pulled pork. And, living in San Diego, nothing I love better than a plate of nachos. Having said that, there's a reason the culinary delights should remain on separate coasts.

Trying to be a little open minded but the pork gave the whole thing the funkiest damn taste. Not bad. Certainly not good. Just......weird. The sour cream, salsa, and pork juice all converged and soggy'ed up the chips in the bottom of the bowl so I had to end up eating most of the chips with a fork. Not cool.

Sorry the bad review is only based on one thing but that's all I had and it wasn't great. But, the bartender was cool, the beer was cold, and the service was good so I guess it served it's purpose.

I guess the whole point of this review is if you're craving some nachos, I would suggest telling them to leave the pork off."}
{"text":"There weren't many options in this wing of Charlotte's airport, and we were starving, but had we read the reviews we would have skipped Stock Car Cafe. As others have noted, service was prompt and fine, but the food was so bland and boring for what you pay. I would rather have spent less for fast food and gotten the same quality for less."}
{"text":"Had the chicken quesadilla. Very delicious. It's lil spicy. And I heard the steak one is chewy. Also had the seafood bisque soup. Also tasty. Atmosphere fits the name of restaurant. Waitress was very friendly. Gave me good advice. Would eat here again .. Prices are reasonable for airport food."}
{"text":"Well, I can only speak to a breakfast experience, it was disappointing. Server was friendly, simple limited menu. Coffee was surprisingly good. But, first they \"lost my ticket\"and the server forgot about me. I finally asked and got my breakfast 25 mins later. They were not busy. The breakfast, you can only get scrambled eggs, rubbery and over cooked; with cold dry toast and promise margarine. Deep fried potato edges are \"breakfast potatoes. They really didn't care, manager never even apologized and server never checked on me or to see how my cold food was."}
{"text":"I normally eat a Chilis when I connect through this airport, but this was closer to my gate.  My server Nicole could not have been nicer or more efficient.  

As burgers go, this one wasn't bad.  As airport food goes, this was pretty darned good.  My burger and fries were cooked perfectly, flavorful, well seasoned and served at the right temperature.

The iced tea was fresh.

I would like to comment on the server in the section next to mine.  Perhaps he was having a bad day.  The place is in an airport.  It's crowded.  People have luggage with them.  He needs to get over whatever his issues are with having to move around luggage and people.  He was turse, rude and even had the nerve to pick up my suitcase and move it without even asking me.  You don't touch people's personal property.  I don't care who you are.  And I let him know that.  When I moved it back, he berated me for being in his way when he had 3 other paths he could have taken to get where he needed to go.  I wish I had gotten his name because he really irritated me and he truly needs to go."}
{"text":"Worst airport bar I've been to In my life .  I've traveled for more than 10+ years and this is by far the worst disorganized mess I have ever seen.  I sit there for one hour, I was able to get  4 mixed drinks no problem, yet the couldn't deliver a pork sliders order in 1 hour.  I left without my food after they did not deliver it 20min after my first complaint.  I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Food is decent for an airport. Waitresses Terry and Gloria = rude. Just plain rude service. Go somewhere else and safe yourself a crappy travel dining experience."}
{"text":"I went into this place with low expectations , I chose it for the close proximity to my gate at the airport as I had 30 minutes. The 2 bartenders working on Thursday night were super friendly and worked well together. I was greeted right away and given a sample of the local brew. It wasn't for me but had a nice cold shock top . The menu is full of stuff I don't eat like nachos and potato skins and burgers, as you would expect at a stock car restaurant . They had a hummus appetizer which I assumed would be lackluster but I ordered it anyway. What a surprise. It was a tasty lemony hummus served with LOTS of zucchini , carrots, celery, cherry tomatoes and pita triangles. It was great. Super quick and friendly service made it a great airport stop."}
{"text":"Breakfast time? Don't do it. Don't eat here. Okay- here's why- I had a fairly long layover- but it took forever to bring me scrambled eggs and sausage. I had only one bite of the eggs. They were out of potatoes. I paid $14 for toast. My friend's eggs were cold and just as gross. Server was nice. I'd give it zero stars if that was an option."}
{"text":"I don't even have words to paint a clear enough picture of this awful restaurant. This restaurant was beyond HORRIBLE. 

We stumbled in here during a layover off an early morning flight. We didn't want to venture far from our gate, so this left us the choice of Bojangles Chicken and Biscuits and Stock Car Cafe. Riiight. Which would you choose?

I ordered a cheese omelette with breakfast potatoes. What I received? I couldn't even tell you. Something bright yellow, greasy, flavorless and needing to be entered into a science experiment to ensure the preservatives it was full of weren't harmful. It's very possible the breakfast potatoes were freezer burned. Maybe even powdered eggs? I hardly believe they even used a kitchen. I bet it was microwaved. It looked what I imagine prison food would look like. Then I made the mistake of ordering \"salsa\", thinking it might help. Boy was I wrong. 

Thankfully, the bookstore next door had a Starbucks. I may not have survived the pot of motor oil  \"coffee\" they were serving.  

The Charlotte-Douglas airport has some very sad options for dining. I know, because I looked. Unless you like fried, greasy, flavorless cardboard-- I highly suggest eating before arrival or packing snacks for your layover."}
{"text":"The food and beverage ain't bad but a bit overpriced.  The NASCAR themed ambiance is phenomenal.  A must stop for NASCAR enthusiasts at the Charlotte airport. Boogity!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, service was terrible.  I counted 4 people at the bar and 8 people at tables.  The waitress kept complaining about how short staffed and busy they were...... I dont recommend this place even if your gate is right next to it."}
{"text":"Naomi and Patricia were working behind the bar and were fantastic. I was encouraged to try a local beer I loved. The food suggestion was spot on. Only real bummer - this is not a sports bar!!! I was forced into listening to god awful top 40 music while 4 NFL games were on the TVs. The rather snippy manager explained they only let folks listen to the NFL games when the \"home\" team is on. I asked who the \"home\" team is at an airport. The answer was really myopic. The guys across the bar are wearing a Patriots hat, Steeler's jersey, Cowboy's t-shirt, and Panther's hat. The guy beside me is from Seattle. I'm watching the Broncos. Can we listen to football - any game is better than this kids bop top 40!! 

Did I mention the dry rub wings are amazing?"}
{"text":"Terrible service and below average food. Will spare you long read, but we are pretty fair with restaurants but they were not busy at all. Server walked away while we were talking to him etc. Food greasy and underseasoned. Typical airport restaurant that doesn't give a shit because you'll probably never be back. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bad service, asked server about somestuff from the menu, ordered the supercharge loaded without jalapenos or sourcream, told her donk light hot spicy. Looked ok, first, was a bit warm, started eating and my mouth started to burn, did the prompt service twice and got no attention, needed water, no service still, had to watch for one to walk by and ask her for water. For 11.99 you get what will be a bowl of soup equivalent, server still not stopping by, will give a 0 to this place although decoration is nice, but so far, thats it, not worth it"}
{"text":"They have fresh brewed unsweetened ice tea!!! Excellent! The service was a little slow but the place was packed. So, was understandable. Great place to kill some time while waiting for your flight."}
{"text":"Stopped here before and early flight and sort of regret it.  The waitress was pretty nice, but my food didn't come out quickly. Food wasn't very good or hot for that matter.  My grits were dry and tasteless and the eggs were overlooked.  The egg yolks actually cooked completely through and turned into a tough egg patty. The bacon was pretty good though.  I ordered the Charlotte Special while I would have been better off going with a breakfast sandwich.  I'll try Starbucks next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on a layover while traveling to San Diego.

Self seating, relatively quick service. The space is...decorated with lots of stock car racing memorabilia. It looks a little busy, but it's an otherwise clean space. There's a bar off to the right as you come in, lots of tables and a couple of high tables. 

Our server, George was efficient, attentive and funny.

Food was ok. The highlight was loaded tater tots. The pulled pork sandwich I had was ok, but I've had way better. I think I was expecting more of a presence from the BBQ sauce, but it fell sort of flat. The slaw that topped it was delicious though. It was light, and the cabbage was still crisp, not mushy.

I probably wouldn't be moved to return if I fly through that airport again. Lots of other options."}
{"text":"I actually like this place, first because it's always closest to my gate when I travel to Dallas and secondly the food is always OK and the service is great.  This is one of the few places that you will find has plenty of wait staff available.  Some places like the resources to keep up.

I had the buffalo chicken salad and I was not impressed.  Very simple salad and just not a lot of flavor and the chicken was obviously just warmed.  I don't really expect much in airport restaurants though."}
{"text":"Aweful! Worst Cobb salad with weird stringy chicken, nasty ranch, guacamole in a tube, and lettuce from a bag that should of been tossed three days ago! Service absolutely sucked for being in an airport with people trying to grab flights.. I'd of been better off at a fast food chain."}
{"text":"I had a long layover at the airport, so I stopped in here for breakfast to pass some time. Since I was by myself, I found a seat at the bar. After going through the menu, I decided on ordering their Over the Wall breakfast.

*Over the Wall breakfast*
It was a classic breakfast with eggs, bacon or sausage, fruit or breakfast potatoes, and toast. I went my eggs cooked over easy, bacon, and the potatoes. Honestly I could've made the same food better at home.

I've definitely had better food at an airport. So the next time I'm in this airport with time to pass, I'll be looking elsewhere to eat a meal. The food was unfortunately mediocre at best. There were some positives. I received good service from the bartender and the coffee was not bad. She was quick to offer me a refill when I finished my first cup."}
{"text":"The service at this place is probably the worst I've ever had. I don't know if they're just all having a bad day, or if I have something on my face - but holy moly they're awfully rude"}
{"text":"Great food for a layover at CLT. Try the Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich. Friendly staff and quick service. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Good place I am sure if you want a burger.  Not a place for a salad (although I kind of assumed that when I went in).  The salad had A LOT of dressing on it.  Atmosphere is really fun and you can watch the planes come in and out if you get a seat by the window.  I do think the biggest let down was that they are NOT environmentally friendly AT ALL.  All meals whether it was take out or dine in were served in styrofoam take out containers.  They also used plastic silverware.  Give the planet a hug and just wash some dishes!  Otherwise this would probably be a great place for a burger and beer, but based on the styrofoam containers, don't eat there! Help save the planet.  I would come back if that changes."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling well after getting off my late night flight. All I wanted was some toast to settle my stomach and the sweet staff accommodated. I had had the absolute WORST flying experience, being stuck in the Denver airport for over 12 hours then having to fly the 1am flight. They will never know what their kindness meant to me!"}
{"text":"Had a few hours between flights and grabbed a few drafts of Stella Artois here. Bartender was friendly. Place is packed with NASCAR memorabilia, you definitely know you are in NC.

Beer was good and cold. Pricey though, but you have to expect that at an airport."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our first trip through the airport.  It was about 6am and they already had customers eating their breakfast.  So we joined the small crowd.  We got the basic breakfast (eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast).  It was good.  Service was very good, she kept on top of all her guest needs with a smile and cheerful words."}
{"text":"Who the hell serves orange juice with ice in it? This place...

Let's see...the breakfast burrito was half the size of my fork...no kidding...and tasteless...the potatoes the burrito was served with were disgusting. 

Sour cream (for the potato skins) was brought to the table half frozen. The potato skins while half way edible weren't crispy or very flavorful. 

The cole slaw was excellent - but had the consistency of soup.

Won't come back."}
{"text":"I had a layover in Charlotte for about 3 hours, so my Girlfriend and I had some time to kill at the airport.  We felt like sitting down, so we stopped at Stock Car Cafe to have a look at their menu.  They offered pretty standard American fare, which was what we both were in the mood for so we grabbed a seat.

The server we had was really nice and relatively quick, which would normally be a big plus in an airport.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap with fries and my girlfriend got the mushroom swiss burger.  The wrap was excellent with plenty of buffalo sauce and ranch, which I really like.  The fries were also pretty good.  I tried my girlfriends burger and it was cooked a little more than I normally like, but that's probably safer.  They put a lot of toppings on it, so it had plenty of flavor.  All in all, I really enjoyed the food, as did my girlfriend.  

The Stock Car Cafe looks pretty much like it sounds - lots of NASCAR everywhere.  Let's remember though, this is Carolina!  When I lived in NC, fantasy NASCAR was a big deal to the people I worked with, so I think they're trying to give out of towners a taste of a sport they love.  I can understand if you'd find it a bit overwhelming though.

The bill for the both of us was $27 before tip, which when you think about it, isn't that terrible for a sit down restaurant at an airport.  There are quite a few mixed reviews on here, but if I regularly went through the Charlotte airport, I would probably find myself here again."}
{"text":"So another trip to see my momma and this was the place to stop off and have 2 beers and 2 shots..........I truly think this is the best way to start off any commerical airline flight....it makes everything seem much better *wink*.

Servers are nice and get my drinks to me quickly.  They even have a survey online that you can go to if you check out your receipt...you can even win prizes."}
{"text":"Terrible. Waited 25 min for a burger, it never came, I had to catch my flight. Please fire every waiter you have and start over. Hope this place goes out of business."}
{"text":"We ate here at the airport in Charlotte. Our waiter was so awesome and friendly. He made the meal enjoyable. We didn't have much time, but he took care of us quickly. 

I had the Caesar Salad with Chicken. My husband had the chipotle chicken sandwich. All the food was good. 

Definitely good food and service for airport food!"}
{"text":"During a layover stopped in for lunch.   

2 great beers.  Appalachian Mountain Brewery Long Leaf IPA and Denali Brewing Twister Creek Mother Trucker Pale Ale.

Caution loaded tater tots were outstanding.   Carolina mustard based barbecue sauce, jalapenos, bacon.

The chicken tender salad was really good as well.

Service was attentive and made quick work of the bill when I looked up and figured out we were at boarding time."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst airport food in my life.  Ordered the steak southwest salad, they brought me chuckie, when I got the steak it tasted just like the chuckie had. It was a weird pressed meat kind of texture.  Three other people in my patch also had to send things back.  Bid bad ass glass of wine was the salvation.  Service was chipper but hopeless."}
{"text":"This place represents the usual airport restaurant.  High price, mediocre quality.  Server was pleasant, coffee was good breakfast....stay away from the potatoes.  No salt/pepper on every table...had to chase it down.  Dry toast... no butter nor on the side."}
{"text":"Look - this place happens to be in a section of the airport that doesn't have a whole lot of selections to begin with and it is in an AIRPORT - you have to expect that it will not be fine dining. 

My server was Brice and Mr Brice was as good as a server gets! He was right there making sure I had everything and everything was to my liking. And for an airport restaurant most everything was what I expected. My chicken tenders were a bit over done, but I've had much worse - at least they had flavor and a bit of juice inside and the BBQ dipping sauce was probably out of a jar, but still tasty - probably the same stuff I use at home so I really cannot complain there. The french fries were not as hot as I would have liked, but they were not all that bad and it appears they use a good quality ketchup in a bottle and they don't give the customer 10 packs of crap to squeeze! The strawberry ice tea was actually perfect and though there wasn't much cole slaw it was good - could have been colder though.

The place was clean, service was a little slow - had nothing to do with Brice though - I just mean it took awhile to get chicken tenders and fries. If you don't have at least an hour to eat - I'd either ask what can be served quickly or I'd go somewhere else, but that would only be due to time! The price was in line with Airport restaurants. However, I cannot go higher then 3 stars here because of the speed of service AND because for me - they need to turn the music down just a bit and perhaps offer more places to plus in!"}
{"text":"Closest to my gate, Stock Car Cafe satisfied the need for speed, and a beer. There are full sized cars hanging from the roof and lots of racing memorabilia throughout. Local beer on tap. Veggie burger was decent option. Service was friendly. Overall A-ok"}
{"text":"Wow. As a motorsports fan, I sure do respect all the old racing memoribilia! But, that's about where it stops...

The food choices were just so-so. It took me longer than normal to make a decision. I settled on the basic burger which seemed to take 30 minute to come out! I guess it's a good thing my flight was severely delayed.. The plate appeared dirty, definitely wasn't worth there time to have good food presentation. Which was followed up by a marginal at best, on the verge of overcooked patty.

I knew I was going to have to pay out my rear bumper for a pint of cold beer - but $10? Good lawd! And that was for a basic Goose Island IPA draft ... Beer choices were: Meh! It's Charlotte! With all the beer we have flowing through the streets and this is the selection you have?? Wow.

You've got some work to do, my friends...

And... I hope you fix your TV remote! Since I asked to have the TV above me changed to the NASCAR race and you told me you couldn't because \"someone dropped the remote into a bucket of water.\" LOLZ Seriously..."}
{"text":"Please don't expect a gourmet meal from an airport restaurant.  With expectations appropriately set, this restaurant delivers. I have had more than a few meals here over the years and have always had friendly, efficient service. The restaurant is clean and there's a high-top seating area that has outlets, which is a bonus in my book and very much appreciated! There's not a fabulous selection of food but what they do have is usually well prepared. Today I asked for a cup of chili and got a bowl big enough to satisfy Jethro Bodine."}
{"text":"OK, this place has the worst coffee ever. And if I have said that about any other establishment's coffee, then this one has surpassed them to take top spot on the worst coffee ever list. The waiter came by to refill, and instead of coming over with a coffee carafe or pot, he had a paper cup with coffee in it that he then transferred into my mug.  Ew, something I don't expect at any restaurant even if it is in an airport. But it really was terrible coffee so I didn't drink much of the refill. The breakfast item, yogurt with granola and a side dish of melons, was OK. 

There is enough competition in this airport that I don't see how they're still open."}
{"text":"Terrible food- bad music - hip hop/rap and mediocre service.  Don't make a pit stop here or get fooled by the cool NASCAR decor. It's not worth it at any price.  I'll never stop here again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent airport bar. Good beer selection. I received good service. Had the loaded tots, which were tasty but pretty hard to mess up. There's worse places to be stuck/have to kill time."}
{"text":"This us a bar restaurant.  Grest beer choices, full bar. The food menu us pretty good. Especially for an airport food establishment.  I had the house crispy chicken salad. It was delicious. Fresh greens, hear tasting chicken, and a good portion."}
{"text":"05.17.11

We land at Charlotte for a connection from Miami to San Francisco.  The plane was delayed 15 minutes.  Then 30.  Then an hour.  Then two.  Two turns to six.  I was unhappy.

In rescues Karen from Stock Car Cafe, who reopened the bar for our flight so we can get through an otherwise six hours of nothingness.

Caveat: this place isn't cheap by any standards.  A glass of wine (OK a double) will run you $15.  Multiply that by three.  Yep.

Still, I can't thank Karen enough."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, Stock Car is alright. You really don't have a ton of options in this area of the airport, especially if you want to sit somewhere to kill time and charge up your different electronic devices.

After selecting a booth so that I could charge my laptop, I ordered buffalo wings and a cheeseburger (I was hungry, okay?). The service was pretty quick and friendly, and the food came out quickly.

The wings weren't bad. The buffalo sauce was tangy enough, and while there were only six wings in my small order, it was enough for an appetizer.

My burger was surprisingly tasty. The menu said that they could only cook it from well done to medium, but the beef was tasty, even though the patty was a little small.

It's airport food, but it's not a bad choice if you need somewhere to hang out."}
{"text":"Better than the bagel place across the way but I wasn't overly impressed with the place. My grilled chicken sandwich was not bad and the tater tots may have been the highlight of the meal. Cheesy decor but it may appeal to some. I'm not a huge stock car fan so it didn't really thrill me much. My server was efficient and helpful but he could probably exude a little more charm and maybe mix in a smile once in awhile. If this were NYC, I wouldn't care but you expect more courtesy/friendliness when you're in North Carolina. Overall, probably your best option in this part of the airport so kudos for that. It did the trick and I was in and out in a decent amount of time so thumbs up for that as well."}
{"text":"I want to be fair - we stopped in at 9:15 pm and it looked like they had a completely full house with one waitress and one server. So this comment is more about management than service because honestly, they did the best that was humanly possible. Mgmt really should check the airline schedules and staff accordingly. For whatever reason tons of flights in Charlotte were departing post 9 and 10 pm when we went through. 

A beer was necessary during our layover to steel ourselves for a flight that wouldn't land until midnight. It took 20 min to order and get served at the bar. And our beers - pints each - set us back $20. 

So all in all it was good beer, close to our gate but a little stressful chugging our beer before catching the next leg of our trip."}
{"text":"I would like to have eaten here, but they were quite late opening.  The website says they open at 5:45, but it is now 6:15 and they still aren't open.  Not enough time to get something to eat before a 7:00 AM flight.  Hopefully management will see this and know they were throwing away money from a lot of people that have up this morning and went to Bojangles or the bagel place instead."}
{"text":"I told the server I had a dairy allergy. No cheese, no butter. 

Food came out looking good. Took a bite, COVERED in butter. Unacceptable! 

Waitress checked with the kitchen and they \"had to use butter\" so my omelet wouldn't stick to the pan. 

Looking forward to getting sick over this - thanks stock car cafe."}
{"text":"a total ripoff! hang on to your wallet! i got charged $14.49 for one vodka martini. you must be joking. and the waitress kept trying to sell me a second! imagine if i had taken the bait?!! i was stunned when i got my check. avoid this ripoff like the palgue.  period."}
{"text":"Worst service ever experienced.  Our server took forever to ask us what to drink.  Didn't check on us again after the food arrived.  He walked by our table over a dozen times never making any eye contact or checking in on our need.  Had to flag down another server to get our bill.

Food was average and being generous with that.  Save your money and time and find anything else."}
{"text":"It there was something lower than one star, that's what I would have given this place.  

The $10+ Chicken Caesar salad I got was not worth $2.00. The chicken was cooked at least 1 week B.C. and stored in a freezer until I made the mistake of ordering it.

Only one word suffices to describe this place, plain NASTY."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, took ages and came out cold. 
Second time it came out colder so we just asked for the bill. 
Server, Brice, didn't seem to care either way. 
Avoid."}
{"text":"For an airport tourist place, it was not bad at all. The service was very friendly and talkative. As I was here fresh off of a 5:10 flight I gave breakfast a shot. I was expecting the usual small airport-has-you-over-a-barrel portions but was happily surprised to get a full plate. If you are coming through the airport, give this place a shot. I think you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"We been traveling all day and was craving for some good wings and great atmosphere, I found the place and i am happy we came here.
We were very lucky to have Alexis as our waitress and this young lady is pleasant, very nice, makes you feel welcome. Her customer service skills are superb!


Thank you Alexis, you rock!!!!!"}
{"text":"Race on bye.  The food was okay.  I ordered the turkey bacon on sourdough and it was okay.  The bread was greasy which was a displeasure with only one napkin.  The French fries are listed as seasoned.  I guess pepper counts as seasoning but a little miss leading.  My biggest complaint is the service.  Jason did not smile and was not friendly until he set the check down hoping for a big tip.  Based on the service I would give another restaurant in the airport a try before going back to Stock Car Café."}
{"text":"Chance, the bartender, makes this airport bar feel like a bar in a busy city somewhere.  She's hard working, straight asks for ID no matter what, cocktails have a good pour of alcohol.  I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Ah, the airport... not only has flying become more of a hassle throughout the years, but food places in the airport always seem to rub me the wrong way.  After taking belts, shoes, and jackets off and being body scanned, all you want is a relaxing beer right?  

I was looking for a drink and some food before my delayed flight to Chicago and found this place in the B terminal of CLT Douglas.

The server was super nice and I ordered a Bad Penny (Big Boss - Raleigh, NC).  It would have been my last \"Carolina brew\" before heading out to my destination.  Ordered a standard Fish & Chips to go along with my beer.

It took a while for the food to come out, but unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait.  The fish seemed it was of the breaded and frozen variety and the coleslaw side it came with had stringy mayo sauce on it.  I did not want to get sick so I left the coleslaw alone, but it seems like it was left under a heat-lamp too long.  The fries were much like the fish... came from a bag and frozen.  The whole dining experience was less than enjoyable and to top it all off the dish was $14!!  I can understand my frozen meal being below 10, but 14 should get me some freshness at least!  Anyways.. my bottled beer ended up being the price of a six pack so my total bill for this meal came out to about 25 bucks.  Yikes.

Good thing you have a captive audience here.  I will stick to just drinking drafts... and maybe at another venue."}
{"text":"Usually airport restaurants are fast and specialize in getting patrons in and out quickly.  I had 30 minutes until my flight boarded which is usually a decent amount of time to get food. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing trying to be healthier. I went for the salmon. I guess it was a matter of going to the Atlantic and actually catching the salmon fresh because it took 25 mins for me to receive my food. SMH. At the end of the day,  the food was just ok..."}
{"text":"Disgusting place with disgusting service . I am a global traveller who has spent his time in 20 odd countries and 40+ different airports and this is the worst among all. It's a racist joint. I didn't want to rate even 1"}
{"text":"With a quick layover in Charlotte, I needed a quick place to get some local NC beer. The Untappd app quickly made me realize that there aren't so many spots with craft beer, but I did see that Stock Car Cafe would work just fine.

They had 5 or 6 craft beer options in larger cans, so I asked some fellas at the bar which one to choose. I was amazed by how friendly everyone was at the bar. Maybe it's an airport thing, but people were just starting conversations with random strangers, not even about the sports game on the TV.

It's a little pricey, but this is also an airport bar and restaurant. It was packed on a Friday afternoon. 

The bar area is a little awkward if you don't get a stool, but it's not the end of the world."}
{"text":"My first clue that I was in for a bad experience should have been the amount of open tables at dinner time.  Even the California pizza kitchen had more patrons.  Over the hour I was there, more unsuspecting souls sat themselves and the extremely mediocre food quality was quickly eclipsed by sluggish service and an overwhelmed and seemingly unmanaged staff.

First, the food:  for $12, I expected a burger better than the Wendy's or Burger King up the concourse.  Nope.  My patty was basically of the pre-formed hockey puck variety, though that does a disservice to Bubba Burgers and the like.  The bun was of grocery store quality.  Flavor were good but for value, Wendy's would have been a better move.

The server was good at taking my order and bringing my beer, but once the food was dropped off, I was basically abandoned.

When it came time to flag the server down for the bill, I was asked \"cash or card\".  When i said card, he held out his hand waiting for me to hand it over, without him having presented me a bill so I know what I was getting charged for.  When I asked for a copy of the bill first, I got a little bit of attitude as if I was making his life so much harder.  Needless to say, that 'tude killed your tip.

Overall, unfortunately there are not many options on this concourse, but you would be better off taking a walk to the main area and trying some of the other options."}
{"text":"Great service. We had 15 mins... They got us in and out. Food not bad, ordered the chopped salad and a turkey sandwich. Will definitely be back."}
