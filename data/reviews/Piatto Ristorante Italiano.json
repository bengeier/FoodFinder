{"text":"I live in Brookline and have wanted to visit for months, finally I got the chance.  Let me start by saying that I am a discerning foodie.  I like good food and good service, but I also want to see new places move forward. Piatto is located on the Blvd next to a bar/pub in a heavy foot and car traffic area.  Parking is easy to find.  The dining room is very pleasant, linen table cloths and a nice renovation of an old house.  A nice place to have a meal. I arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night.  There were maybe 8 tables and 7 were full.  By the time I left at 9 p.m. the dining room was empty.  From 7:30 to 9 only one additional customer came in. Service was friendly but ungodly long.  One server for the whole dining room.  She took the orders, served he food, cleared the tables, ran the bar and collected the money.  It took 75 minutes for two dinners and no dessert. The meal:   I had linguine with shrimp and scallops.  It was prepared in a red sauce.  The pasta was soft, far from al dente. I really had to search for the shrimp, first because there were so few and second because they were frozen and petite.  The scallops, well Im not even going to go there.  The sauce was overwhelmed by oil!  Yes, oil!  In fact I sent it back to drain the oil off the plate, it looked like broth. See pic.  When it was returned, oil was still sitting on the plate but it was spiced up with sprinkled cayenne pepper now.  Ugh, what up? My diner companion had chicken saltimbocca - layered prosciutto  saut√©ed with marsala wine and mushroom sauce.  Sounds good, right?  My dinner mate noted that it was low on flavor and disappointing.   The spice of the evening was cayenne.  It is put in salad, garnished on plates and added to sauce.  Ive never seen such all across the board use of cayenne anywhere.  The table guests next to us kept coughing and fanning themselves as they tried eating their dinner salad laced with cayenne pepper.  Defining difference?  I think its a deadly mistake.  Two meals, one glass of wine, plus tip, $58.00  The chef came out to greet the tables.  Affable young entrepreneur for sure.  I would suggest asking the guests how to improve the flavors of the food he is making would be a good next step.  He is cooking to his tastes and in my opinion he is missing what I come for.  He apologized multiple times for what was wrong from stock, to stove to plate.  That is not a confidence inspiring action.  I wish him luck, there is alot more to do here.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying I love to give new independent businesses a chance, but I should have went with my gut on this one.  After trying over a dozen times to make a reservation by phone and never received a call back I personally went there to make the reservation.  The ambiance is lacking but thought the food might make that up.  We were the only ones in the place on a Saturday at 6pm.  Then, to find out the chef wasn't there that night, and we would have a \"chef in training\"  Well, he needs a lot more!!!   We had to ask for water, the silverware was dirty, we were given our own corkscrew to open our wine.  We were told to go with family style since they only had 5 burners.  (who says that??)  So, since there were 8 of us, we went with that.  We were given ice cold plates for our dinner. The chicken was not cooked and fatty, the pasta was cold.  We ordered tortellini and when it came out it was penne.  This wasn't even addressed, so I questioned it.  I was told they ran out of tortellini.  How did you run out when we were the only ones there and they just opened at 4pm?  We should have been told prior to this and ask if that was o.k. The calamari was overcooked and like rubber.  The only good thing I have to say about this place was, the water was good!     I had read all the other reviews and decided to give it a chance.  So wrong!!  With so many other great restaurants popping up in Pittsburgh, don't waste your time or money on this place!!   For the same price we paid, we could have had a great meal 5 minutes away at Amels!!!   Oh, and last but not least, they only take cash.  At no time were we told this, or was it posted anywhere.    To sum it up in one word-awful.  No wonder why his other restaurant didn't survive!"}
{"text":"AMAZING little place! On a weekend day trip with my boyfriend, we yelped this place to get away from downtown. Everyone had waits in excess of 2 hours. We called and the owner answered the phone himself. He told us there was no wait and to come right on in for some delicious italian food and relaxation. I can't tell you just how right he was! The place is tiny but homey, 9 tables total with one server on a Saturday. She was more than capable of handling the 4 tables she had at one time, and she was so polite, kind and lovely. I had the chicken piccata and my boyfriend had the homemade Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms and we shared the calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was tender and the marinara sauce was so flavorful. My dinner came with a salad- word of caution...if you choose the spicy dressing be prepared! It is REALLY spicy, but still tasty! The pasta was perfectly al dente, the piccata sauce was perfectly balanced and the Alfredo sauce was cheesy perfection. With the appetizer and our two entrees, the bill came to $41 and some change. This is a place that you find once in a lifetime, We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret.. I have been to a lot of Italian restaurants and this is on the top of my list. Marsala sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"Good food.  Scott is a good chef and his wife was our waitress. Learned well from his grandmother. Pasta is from Italy.  Everything is homemade and fresh.  The linguine scampi and shrimp was delicious.  The Mozzarella Marinara is good fresh mozzarella with a very tasty roma marinara.  The Penne Amaticiana is a very aggressive spicy dish!  Only issue is the the Brookline Pub is connected and you go in the side door at the smoking area outside the Pub and it  somehow gets into the restaurant and lingers in the restaurant.  The menu has chicken, a salad and soup and lots of pasta.  If you like good pasta, you will enjoy Piatto!  Piatto gets its alcohol form the Pub.  Someone in the restaurant did BYOB and Lauren said it was $5 charge.  Next time will BYOB."}
