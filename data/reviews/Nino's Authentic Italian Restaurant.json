{"text":"My wife and I were craving a good pasta, so searched the internet for \"best pasta in Oakville\".  We noticed Nino's and thought we'd try it out.  It did not disappoint!   The pasta was exactly what we were craving as it was homemade and fresh.  I really enjoyed my Carbonara.  The atmosphere was very casual.  I think for the level of food, it could be a bit fancier, but still nice enough.  The pricing was very reasonable and we felt the portion sizes were large (especially for the Pane Fritto appetizer we ordered - we packed 4 of the 6 pieces as it was way too much for the 2 of us)  The pizza looked amazing, so we definitively intend on coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time with a friend tonight for dinner. Wow! Food was incredible and very inexpensive. A relaxed atmosphere with good food. Definitely be back for the penne a la vodka. Penne was cooked perfectly and the sauce was one of the best I have had - not too rich but lots of flavor and great creamy texture. IMO best bang for your dinner buck for this area of the city. One of the staff told me they have been opened for 5 years so they must be doing something right. Not sure how this has been off my food radar for so long."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and caters to gluten and gluten-free pizza lovers. I actually tried both crusts and both were fantastic - especially with Nutella and banana! The rice balls are also a must - try. Service was great and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my new favourites. It's a great place to take your family especially if your interested in sharing appetizers because they have many delicious ones. I also love the atmosphere of the restaurant it feels very homey and inviting. The pastas they have there are amazing, I tried penne with a spicy tomato sauce and it is now one of my new favourite pasta I have ever had. Overall I highly suggest trying the restaurant for yourself. I definitely know that I'm going to go back."}
{"text":"Ordered Carbonara.  It was salty, very watery and very little pancheta.  Hardly taste the fresh ground black pepper."}
{"text":"Arrived at your restaurant at 7:30pm, told the lady by the counter I had a reservation for 7:30pm and she had a puzzled face. Which I knew from there this was going down hill. She seats me, as I am waiting for my friend to show up. No waiter/waitress came to ask me if I wanted anything to drink or apps. Eventually an older man brought some bread and water. My friend showed up around 7:40. We had decide what we wanted to order. Had to flags someone down to a place our order. By this time it was just before 8pm.  Had to flag someone down again to get a drink. It took 1HOUR for them to just bring out our appetizer and it was cold!!! We asked our waiter when our main dish would be out and he said should be out soon. Which it was, but our meals where cold again. Our waiter offer to take it back but we were worried we would never see it again. Finally we got our bills,  our waiter Josh was fantastic. He compensated for our disaster of an evening. As I was looking at my bill I noticed there was a charge for change of sauce of $3.00 as well as my gnocchi was a different price from the menu. I explained to waiter and he was very understanding, went to his manager or coworker and got it changed.   Another thing what is with your atmosphere it was dark could not see my menu had to use the flashlight on my phone, music was way to loud for a small space and you were playing cartoon ( corner gas) on the tv? Not sure what type of crowd you desire but this is NOT an upper scaled Italian restaurant. The likely of us recommending or visiting this restaurant again is a extreme NO.  One more thing, when you are leaving a restaurant and the owner or manager asks you how your meal or experience was and you tell them you were very unhappy. Your answer shouldn't be, we were busy tonight, your answer should be, we are sorry to hear that, next time we hope we can make your experience better."}
{"text":"How can this place consider themselves authentic Italian if I didn't get yelled at by a middle aged woman with a rolling pin yelling out some foreign nonsense?? The staff was also friendly and wanting to help, which is a completely inaccurate for Italy. Now my two kids will come to expect friendliness on our trip to Italy next year. How will I have explain this to them when they're sorely disappointed?"}
{"text":"Very good Italian fare at reasonable prices.   The mozzarella sticks were amazing, great gluten free options, and all my favourite Italian wines.   Food was served hot and with a smile.   We will definitely come back to this undiscovered gem."}
{"text":"1st visit last night with 5 other friends. O.K. but nothing special. Portion sizes were a little small. A friend really enjoyed the Gorgonzola gnocchi but another did not enjoy his penne. The dessert options were odd and the cheesecake was warm; yikes. Our $25 dollar bottle of Chianti Classico was $50 but that's somewhat typical. As I said, just an O.K. spot."}
{"text":"This is a great place for value!  Cesar salad was great and so was the penne al a vodka.  If they did something with the decor and a better selection of wine by the glass I would give it a 5.  Very casual dress.  We will go back for sure"}
{"text":"Really good food, they should work on their service... sometimes it can be really loud in there. Make sure to check online to see if any events are happening on the other side for your best experience! I recommend the gnocchi!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and we ordered a pasta, a pizza and the pane fritto for appetizer. The pizza was so salty and the pasta was as well the lane fritto was probably made from frozen and all around the food was just not good. On top of that my stomach felt weird for the rest of the night. The waitress was nice and that's why I'm giving it 2 stars. I will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Nino Paninos is great! They have some of the best pizza in town, and are always kind and very friendly when we come in. Amazingly enough, they even remembered us and what we ordered the last time when we came in a second time, a few weeks later. Excellent customer service!  I've had the small pizza with salami, which tastes just like pepperoni, and it's a nice, big portion and delicious. I have tried many pizza places in Oakville and they all seem like the same bland pizza. Nino's pizza is the best I've had here and I'll definitely be going again soon!"}
