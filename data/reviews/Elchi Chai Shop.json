{"text":"Awesome place. Reminds me of the Chai (i.e. Tea) shops we find in East Africa. Let's start with the Chai. Top notch. Like mama used to make. The unique paratha flavors are a mix of traditional and modern. Just the right balance. Come try the place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Their chai is good . I like supporting local business . The sitting area is really cute and spacious . So if you don't want to be overwhelmed with a lot of people this is a great place specially during a weekend morning. I tried the parotha, and I think it was ok !"}
{"text":"This is a charming little shop run by two very sweet sisters, with some of the best chai I've had outside my own home. Both the cardamom and masala chai are delicious, with a perfect balance of spice, tea, and creaminess. You can taste samples of each if you're not sure which one to get, and you add the sugar yourself. The \"chai\" you get at places like Second Cup or Starbucks cannot even begin to compare if you're looking for authentic chai.   Both the vegetarian and meat samosas are delicious. I removed one star because I personally wasn't a huge fan of the parathas - I found them a bit dry and doughy. Otherwise, hats off to this wonderful place and I sincerely hope it thrives and grows.  PS I have no idea if this is doable, but if the owners are looking to develop a new drink I would LOVE to try a chai bubble tea - I think it would be delicious and unique!"}
{"text":"Never a big fan of chai but this is amazing! Had a cup of their ginger milk tea. It was so smooth and it was such a great balance between the two flavours! Would definitely recommend it to anyone, even if you aren't a chai fan!"}
{"text":"OK I am not a connoisseur of Chai but am quite familiar with the taste profiles. First thing first I am used to freshly made version and not the one they sell here. Even at roadside spots they always have a pot brewing and you get it right from the stove after ordering. The version offered here is in hot beverage dispensers. The classic version I tried here wouldn't rate above a bagged version or dare I say a powdered version being sold nowadays (I keep one for guests and all one has to do is pour boiling water!) The setup itself isn't very nice IMO. Tight seating and the cups seemed to be designed to slip out of your hand. They offer food items as well and had a I not read about those beforehand I wouldn't even know they are sold. Not much in terms of display for the snack items.  I can't recommend this spot for chai for now might update after I have tried the food."}
{"text":"After not being in the area for a month or so, it was great to come back and see this really nice cafe had popped up. And just when I was looking for some chai as the cooler weather is coming in too!  This seems to be a family business with kids and parents around working the cash register etc. The young boy who took my order was nice and so polite! I got the Elchi chai tea and was very pleased with it.   A trendy little place in terms of decor and atmosphere but the food and teas seem authentic which is great. Definitely a great spot to come and catch up with friends over a nice cup of tea. A little pricey for me to go regularly but I would go back to try some of the other food and drink.  Also a cool concept to have a whole cafe centered around chai teas, hope they're able to stick around!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Los Angeles and read the reviews to find the best Chai in Toronto and was not disappointed. Excellent Chai Tea."}
{"text":"I came in with a friend and we had a great time! It is an intimate spot and not crowded at all. We ordered the iced masala chai, and liked it so much that we had another round; absolutely perfect on a hot summer afternoon! We also had samoosas - veg and chicken. The samoosas, though good, were not exceptional and I would have preferred more of a variety of appetizers to enjoy our chai with. That being said, I can't wait to try some of their hot chais during the winter."}
{"text":"During my lunch hour, I felt an inexplicable need to go to The Rock Store on Harbord. Don't ask me why - I just said it was inexplicable. Anyway, I went to the store and ooohed and aaahed but didn't buy anything.   On my way back to work, Elchi Chai caught my eye. I decided to pop in and see what's up. The cafe owner greeted me warmly. Can I just say that the interior is very nice? Well turns out that the cafe owner used to be an interior designer before setting up shop with her sister. Nice.  I got the masala chai, which happily could be made with cashew milk instead of regular. (I'm lactose intolerant. Bite me.) I also asked for it to be sugar free and was happy to find out that they don't put sugar in their drinks. Perfect, a cafe after my own heart. I chatted with one of the cafe owners for a while and she was super friendly. A+ for effort.   I couldn't linger to enjoy my chai, as I had to get back to my office. The masala chai was excellent, though. Spicy and aromatic. Nothing like the watery 'chai' you get from Starbucks or Davidstea.   Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee spot, run by two adorable sisters. The vibe is neighborhood-y and laid-back.They offer buttery paratha's, complementing strong chai (loved the masala blend) - perfect pick-me-ups when you need energy to be a tourist.   Support local businesses! Especially one's run by entrepreneurial ladies!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Ice Hibiscus. It is a very refreshing drink. The shop itself is very minimalistic and a perfect place to study. Absolutely love it. Have not tried their food yet but it looks very good."}
{"text":"I am reluctantly giving this place 3 stars, with hopes of updating this in the future. I was looking forward to this place. I've had my share of masala chai at home and random places, but I was really looking forward to something so cozy as Elchi Chai Shop.   When I walked in, it wasn't busy, but about three others came in right after me. I ordered a masala chai, and the kebab balls. There was only one person taking the orders, and making the food in the kitchen (second person was on break I think), so service was a bit slow at start.  They were out of the masala chai, they were making a fresh batch. When she brought out the kebab balls, she offered me to try the elchi chai while I waited for the other one. Very nice of her, and I got to try something else!  The elchi chai and masala chai were both good! I think I liked the masala one better. You can sweeten it as you like. The kebab balls were good. They were very mild in terms of spice, which I can understand for the regular patrons. The two chutneys were pretty good too. My biggest issue is that I got sick after. I think it was the kebab balls... they appeared to be fully cooked through. Or maybe the chutneys? I don't know... but my stomach felt awful after!   I love the concept of this place! The parothas looked really good, and the snacks looked good on the menu. It's very cozy, bright, clean and the girls were very nice. My suggestions: a) opt for 2-seater tables rather than 4-seaters, most people were on their own. b) sugar in the teacups in the middle of the tables are cute, but I would much prefer if they were covered. c) food safety.   I'll try to give this another shot."}
{"text":"The Masala Chai transports me to my mom's kitchen...so delicious! Very reasonably priced. The food was fresh and flavourful. The location if beautifully designed and a friendly/chill place to sit down. My only complaint is that it is not closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"We had an event catered by Elchi Chai and picked many items from thei regular service menu.  The food was absolutely amazing, incredibly spiced and really authentic tasting.   The people who run Elchi were so also really sweet and lovely, and you could tell they put a lot of hard work and pride into their food.  Can't wait to visit them again and try out other things on their menu."}
{"text":"This is place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! The interior design is beautiful, the owners are so warm and inviting. The chai is so full of flavour and delicious with a lot of different varieties in tea, I would recommend the elachi chai. The food is very delicious and fresh, my favourite was the jalape√±o cheese paratha and smore paratha!! Everyone should come in and try the delicious food and chai."}
{"text":"I love Indian chai but never thought I'd get the real stuff outside of India or family/friend's homes. Which is why I was SO happy when I stumbled across Elchi! Their assortment of drinks is on point and each one I've tried is fantastic. I personally love the classic Elchi chai, but have tried the Masala, dirty masala, elixir and gold milk, and they're all authentic and delicious. Depending on the mood you're in, you also can't go wrong with a refreshing mango lassi.   I haven't tried much of the food here, but the banana nutella parotha I tried was yummy. They also sell bottled drinks, including Thumb's up and Limca, which are faves when in India and a fun alternative if I'm ever feeling nostalgic.   The store itself is cute although a bit small - only 4ish tables for people to sit. It also runs super warm, presumably so they have the appropriate environment to make authentic chai, so I've never sat and had chai there. But, I don't care about that - I'm here for the fantastic chai!"}
{"text":"For those of you who aren't lucky enough to live close to your mom who can make you comfort food - this is an excellent spot to replicate the \"just like home\" feeling.   Upon walking in to the cute brick storefront, the girl up front smiled and welcomed me. I knew exactly what I wanted and she quickly took my order and went about making my food. I ordered the masala chai and the potato paraontha.   The aroma of the food was intoxicating! I couldn't wait to eat. The food arrived fresh and warm; perfect for a rainy day. The chai was excellent; definitely made me a little less homesick.   Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny spot run by 2 sisters (I think).  I saw it on BlogTO one day and figured when I'm in the area I would check it out.  They are so nice - if you want to try their teas (Elchi and Masala) they will give you a sample so you can decide.  Note: they advise you their chais are not made with sugar (I believe this is the Gujarati way of making tea) but you can add sugar/honey if you wish.  They also have cold drinks as well.   They do also have a small food menu - some parathas (sweet and savoury) samosas, kofta balls etc.  not a full meal but great accompaniments to chai.    It's a tiny place with a few tables, no AC when I was there a month or so ago (but it just opened).    The only small thing I didn't like were the cups the chai comes in - they are awkward to hold/drink.    Overall great spot to relax and drink your chai :)"}
{"text":"So happy we stopped in to try the Chai, it was amazing! They also had samples of all of their drinks so that you can test what they had on tap. My favourite after the chai of course was the Elixir which was chilled and refreshing.  We ordered the tandoori chicken which was spicy and delicious with the freshly made parotha. Also we had the potato medley and finished with the Banana, Nutella for dessert, yummy! We loved the friendly atmosphere and the patio was a nice touch.  We live around the corner and I am so excited to make this a regular stop soon"}
{"text":"As a student, I'm always looking for a cozy place near campus to enjoy a warm beverage and study... this one fits the bill! The tea was delicious and the woman who took my order was able to accomodate my gluten intolerance. The single complaint I have is that the cafe music is provided by Spotify... and every couple of songs I was subjected to an advertisement! It totally throws off my studying and relaxation vibe... an easy fix that will definitely improve my chances of coming back with friends!"}
{"text":"I make Chai at home and avoid it everywhere else. Very few places get it right. THIS is one of them.   I had Masala tea and we shared Samosas and Meat Balls. Meatballs were okay. Could use more spices. Veg Samosas were hot and tasty as they should be with piping hot tea. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been eager to try out Elchi Chai Shop since it opened and finally made it in for lunch today with my husband and our super foodie friend. I love the idea and the concept, but the execution isn't quite there yet. Some (hopefully) constructive points for improvement: 1) can we get some AC up in this joint? It was seriously toasty in there. 2) Play some music and/or get better speakers! When I first arrived it was dead silent - probably not the ambience they're going for. At some point someone may have started to play music, but it may also have been music I was hearing through someone's headphones, hard to say. 3) The service needs to be faster. It took way too long to get our food, which feels even looooonger given points 1 and 2 above. Time slows down you're silently sweating to death. On the food side, it's all interesting and innovative, but not the flavour and texture experiences I was hoping for. I like my parantha Punjabi-style, flaky, moist, and pliable enough to scoop up accompanying raita, daal, sabji, etc. The parantha served here are dry and crunchy, and don't lend themselves well to being used as a vehicle for other food to be delivered to your mouth. Yogurt dip aka raita needs to be a lot larger and less sweet, and it would be nice to have some achar (pickle). On the plus side, everyone at our table enjoyed their bevvies (elixir, sweet lassi, iced chai, masala chai), the kebab balls, and the samosa. I give the owners props for trying out something different and hopefully they'll continue working on improving their recipes and ambience to make their vision come to life."}
{"text":"Great gem in Toronto! Have been wanting to stop in for awhile and so glad that I got the chance to. Drinks and food were full of flavour, and hands down one of the best samosas I've had so far. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"Saw this cute little place driving by and had to stop by this morning. The owner was very nice and friendly. They just opened a month and I see a lot of potential in a place like this.   I got samples of the Elchi and Masala chai. Both were delicious and I had a hard time deciding. Went with masala and it was smooth, creamy, and delicious!  I got a parotha with butter and jam. Simple and tasty. I hope to come back before we go back to the states.   Wish we had a place like this in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place since I love a good tea shop... however I felt a little let down.The decor is bright and cheerful but the vibe is cold..unlike the temperature inside which was roasting...even on a cool day not conducive to a longer stay.Service was kind of lukewarm and I didn't think the display of 4 cookies promoted the food offerings.  There was one other person in the place a midday...not a great sign. As for the chai...it was okay but I've had way better at Plentea..with great customer service. Also at Moonbeam in Kensington.  I feel kind of bad that this is negative since I am normally very positive about indie cafes"}
{"text":"A wonderful family chai shop that demonstrates Canadian values. A sister duo runs this cafe with occasional help from family and friends. This illustrates how beautiful and supportive this family is of each another. It also illustrates that with dedication, hard work and sweat equity, you can make your dreams come true.  Canadian values? Um, I think I meant that this has a unique community feeling. Indians and Muslims will make this a weekend destination and their reprieve from suburbia (myself included). It also has a fare share of diverse urban professionals, academics, students, artists... etc. A true urban hangout!  Inclusive space: Check!  Food is delicious. Chai is terrific and authentic. It's fresh and it's not served out of a premade tetrapak with a long shelf life! We're dealing with sophisticated chai and tiffin wallas at this joint!  The beef kabobs are moist and the accompanying chutneys are a flavour bomb in the mouth! We also adored the tandoori chicken parotha and the Nutella banana parotha. Devoured.  Congrats to the Ebrahim sisters. Wishing you continued success on this much needed establishment."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place you could get proper chai. I've been all over the world and nothing gets closer to chai masala in Toronto than elchi chai. Felt like they've got some chaiwala (tea boy) whipping up magical golden tea in the back! Place is run by two lovely sisters from India and the atmosphere is cosy. The grilled cheese and potato medley paratha are probably the best choice if you're looking for a modern twist to an Indian snack. The butter chicken paratha was a bit of a disappointment but none the less the place is a solid 4 stars and I'll definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Man, I have been meaning to try food and drinks at Elchi and doing so they made me discover a whole new neighbourhood the goodole Harbord Street.  As I entered I was taken back by the aromas I grew up smelling in my moms kitchen. Sweet melodies of turmeric, cloves, cardamom in the air...I really wanted to try out their chais but they had milk or cashew milk as alternatives and am allergic to both..so I decided to go for their elixir under their Tisane menu which is hot water brewed with herbal blend at $4.45  I also ordered their tandoori chicken paratha wrap at $10.35 it was indeed roti meeting the flaky croissants, tasty, delicious.  Authentic and Toothsome! High five for this joint!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars... definitely a step up above average but it's a new place and still having it's growing moments.  On Harbord, there's a cute little place that has a nice menu of drinks that can spice up your day or chill you down.  It also have some parantha (flat bread) with sweet and savoury toppings.  It's all easily affordable and you can relax in their clean and modern seating area while they make their food.  It appears to be a young group of entrepreneurs who are doing this so I think it's great they're putting out solid good food at very reasonable prices.    The place isnt very big but it is nicely done with simple lines and nice pop of colours everywhere.  I thought it was cute how their menu is behind the counter on rolls of kraft paper.  Love the idea.  We didn't order any food but we saw another group did and it smelled quite good and you can tell from the sounds from the kitchen it was all being prepped fresh.  No beeps... no opening of freezers... just sounds of chopping, rolling, searing on the stove, and the occasional clink from plating.  The one noticeable growing pains was that the person out front tended to head back into the kitchen and not notice what is going on in front... another group came in and just stood at the counter for nearly 5 minutes with no one noticing them from the kitchen.    Our order was 2 iced chai latte with almond milk.  I loved how the chai was reasonably priced at $4 something before the addition of the almond milk.  The Chai had a nice spice kick and not sugary.  The only thing I would recommend is to ask for less ice... they had a lot of ice and it became very watery quite quickly.  If they did freeze some of their chai ahead of time, that would be so much better than just water ice cubes.    It has some good potential to be good... hopefully they can grow from their opening stage."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm!!!!  Their chai is so much better than my chain. And they have golden tumeric milk!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best chai you can get out and about. I'm always searching for true chai and winding up disappointed, but Elchi Chai Shop truly delivers. I'm not located anywhere close to it in Toronto, but I will happily go well out of my way for their tea."}
