{"text":"Really nice modern atmosphere and for the sports junkies out there, the bar has a few tele's to watch your favourite teams.  We shared an order of steak bites and the Mexican burger with sweet potato fries. The steak bites were really really good with a little kick to them. The burger was decent but we both didn't really care for the bread.  I was really disappointed in was the service. We were there around noon on a Tuesday and there was only one server! She was run off her feet and we did an awful lot of waiting. It took over 30 minutes to get a glass of water. My friend finally went to the bar to ask for water and we still had to wait."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!  Shrimp tacos are delicious with the cucumber wasabi dip.   Guacamole is a little bit bland but I like mine with mint and cumin in it, so probably just what I am used to.  Overall good food!  Drinks are great and staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is closed. The old number 403-457-5003 now reaches Alberta Portrait Inc."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but is NOT Mexican... I know my Mexican food inside out and I can tell you this is not Mexican, could be Tex-Mex ?   Pozole soup is made with sweet corn and beans... really? there is no such thing like this in Mexico nor at other Mexican restaurants in the city that I know of, so please do not think this is Mexican food.  And wasabi dip? NOT Mexican either... where do they get the idea there is wasabi in Mexico?  Sure place has a nice ambiance but then again... it's not close to Mexican food!"}
{"text":"what a surprise! stopped by there by accident.  We could not get into other recommended restaurants and we saw the live band playing at Avocado.  Live music was amazing.  They had beer buckets and drink special which were quite decent.  We had Nachos which was a very big portion and plenty of Jalapenos, Guacamole was mediocre given the name of the place..   For entree, I ordered Braised Beef which was very nicely done.  The meat was very tasty, and tender with horseradish sauce on a bed of potato  mash, cherry tomato and asparagus.  The waitress was also very friendly and helpful which always makes you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Drunk chicken burrito with yam fries was great. The mood was happy, a guy (I presume a manager) was going around being social and ensuring everyone was enjoying their food."}
{"text":"Was there again last night - kinda disappointed.. Service was friendly but like other reviews said - slow!... Short- staffed I think. What really disappointed me was the new menu- different from the first visit. It seems having less options and being more expensive now:("}
{"text":"Avocado does that causal dining thing that all new restaurants do in Calgary - it follows the following rules: - Sports playing on TVs around the room at all times - Modern atmosphere - \"Fusion\" of foods  None of these things are particularly bad, it's just boring to see the same restaurant with a new menu pop up around Calgary.   Despite my bitterness, the food is not bad. I've been there probably three or four times since it opened in the winter ( I live and work nearby) and I've had some disappointing meals (full dinner salads are not very big and way too expensive) and some really great eats (\"Mexican\" Burger w/ Guacamole was to die for).  So, this is a mediocre review because I've seen this restaurant a hundred times and it's not special. The service is somewhere between one and two stars- but, it's decent food and is worth a try. Especially if you're into Mexican food, which is the \"theme\"- and they do it with a good amount of zing."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Mexican (and spicy) food, so this place is perfect for me. This new location just opened up a few days ago with the same authentic Mexican food as the south location and the modern style.   There are a large amount of healthy options, all at decent prices."}
{"text":"3 STARS. Food good. Service good for most. Ambiance banal. With all the choice in Calgary, there is no convincing set of reasons to return. If curious, give it a go. Otherwise, try the Italian restaurant up the street. Cheers."}
