{"text":"Although the food is only OK and the beer tastes strangely like corn, this place has a weird spot in my heart since I've had a couple great conversations and laughs here. Admittedly, the food and drink here are average, they are extremely cheap so it's easy to give them a passing grade. Queenshead offers $10 pitchers of Canadian and on Sundays they have a 69c wing special when you purchase any drink. Not bad compared to big chains like St. Louis and Wild Wings! The wings were massive and slightly dry but for 69c each, I'll take it."}
{"text":"Mehhh. Its a local watering hole.  Some specials on leafs/raps game night...wings are ok. Check it out if youb in the area. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place has great beer and wing specials. Wing sizing is very good. One issue I have is washroom cleanliness. Please clean your washrooms everyday."}
{"text":"Thinking about this place makes me want to vomit. Roach in my food. Gross. Will never return and hope they close this place down. Good thing they serve alchol because people must be completely wasted to eat at this dive."}
{"text":"Quite tasty! Ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and butter chicken dish through the Just Eat app. First timers. It arrived in under an hour (pretty good for a pub delivery order) and it was of a high quality and well seasoned. They took note of my written requests and everything came as ordered. Fries could have been a bit better but the entrees were above par. I recommend it and will order again."}
{"text":"To be fair, I didn't try the food, so I can't say whether it was as bad as other Yelpers are claiming.

Decor is cheap and generic looking, mostly beer adverts and mirrors, not unlike a Firkin pub. Nice dark lighting, just the way I like it. The main draw for me is the CHEAP BOOZE; 10 dollar Canadian pitchers, 3.50 shots (selected varieties, includes jack or tequila). Really good mix of regulars, every time we've (me and my gf) gone there we've struck up a conversation with someone. Servers are hilariously incompetent but very friendly and attentive... they try hard but they mess up orders a lot. Music is by jukebox with the subwoofer cranked up way too loud... it's OK for dance tracks but sucks for country/rock. Be warned that it's 50c for some songs and 1.00 for others.

Overall the place is a bit divey but the CHEAP BOOZE and clientele more than makes up for it. You should go. You'll make friends.

Plus there's CHEAP BOOZE."}
{"text":"Got severe food poisoning here one time off the bruschetta. Came back again for some beer a couple years later. Draught was flat, surprise suprise."}
{"text":"Rather disappointing. Service uninspired. Not inclined to come back. Sorry to be negative,  could be the staff to-day or maybe it's me."}
{"text":"Not a great place. It was nearly $7 for a small slice of cheesecake, wasn't even that good. The order took 20 minutes to arrive, which is far too long for a slice of cake. First and last time coming here."}
{"text":"Being located on Victoria Park and 401, you do get a bit of congestion with the traffic, especially when the whole Consumer Road corporate world is located across the street. The place is located in a plaza with plenty of parking and is a place you cannot miss. 

When you enter the restaurant you see lots of space and the aura is loud exciting, as a bar should be. Each day there are drink and food specials. On this particular day (thursday) it was $11 for a pitcher of Canadian. Can't complain to that.

Their poutine was a large portion. It was served on a large plate paltered with cheese and gravy. Nothing special but definitely a large meal. Their french onion soup is hot and onion-y as it should be. The prices are fair and nothing crazy.

The servers can be better though. They do not really come check on you much and talk as if you are dumb. I guess my waitress was having a bad day.

In the summer after a long day of softball, it is a great place to just stop by and have a few cold beers. Wish they had a patio but can't ask for much.

Definitely worth coming by."}
{"text":"Some complaints on this place?  Really?  It is what it is.  A solid watering hole.  Don;t make it more! 

Yes you are in Scarborough, so you get the odd character in here... Part of the cities charm.  But for most part, I think this spot is solid.

Decent Pub Grub, TV sets for your sports, and a crowd that will actually talk back to the tv screen.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Used to come here after work with co-workers and have not frequented this establishment in years. 

Came here last night to watch the Golden State VS. OKC game. Shared two mini pitchers of Canadian ($5.99) which comes to about a pint and 2/3 per pitcher. We ordered the calamari ($8.99) to share, and their calamari is only ok, it came with a weird tasting sauce and I just asked the waitress for hot sauce... and what does she bring me Tobasco and SRIRACHA! Who knew that sriracha went so well with calamari? So the calamari became the vehicle in which to deliver sriracha into my system. 

The service was ok, the waitress checked on us regularly. There are TVs everywhere which is ideal if you want to watch the game or need a distraction from whoever you happen to go with. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So I have gone to this place a couple times, and the food is okay, they have decent beers and the servers are usually good. Last few times I went on Friday, I've sat at the bar and the bartender is absolutely horrible. Don't get me wrong they have a few decent ppl or I wouldn't have returned, but this one lady ... Indian or something of that sort is So rude, looks like she absolutely hates her job and has no positivity. She never smiles or asks if you want food or another drink or sais thank you when you pay... Like totally negative person. You're in the service industry :( like come on!!! The first time I thought it was an off night, but after the last 2 times I went ... I'll never go back. Seriously, you can't be rude and give customers the cold shoulder. It's not just me or an isolated incident. I'm from the area ... Others I know have sai similar remarks. Ive spent good money there before but people like that ruin your \"night out.\" Bring your old bartenders back on Friday at least, they were atleast nice ... I'm not the only one who thinks this! I'm just writing this sincerely as I'm completely turned off from my last few experiences... And others will turn away if you don't change things"}
{"text":"This place was very nice , friendly people , nice big screens to watch a big game on . tried to check in but i had no 3G when i went but i did and it was really cozy"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with some friends and couldn't decide on what to eat. Figured I'd stick with the basic pub food - fish and chips but I wanted to sub for onion rings instead. Got a glass of water and to my disgust I saw a good amount of floaty things in it. Asked for another glass and same thing: lots of floaty things. No thank you. To avoid all that i ended up ordering a coke. I found the first restaurant I've been to that doesn't offer free refills!  

Food was fine, nothing extraordinary, typical fish and onion rings. We sat and talked for a long time and had to flag a waitress down for our bill. What shocked me is that not only did they charge me the full price for the fish and chips, they charged me an extra 3.99 for the onion rings. Never going back. Will be headin to Swiss Chalet next time we want dinner in that area."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Large portion meals. Ample seating. Nice variety menu. Our entire group was very satisfied with the food and service. This was our second time and have left very satisfied."}
{"text":"The best!!
So many beers on tap, best yam fries, and nicest staff
Overall atmosphere is really great too:)
My friend and I absolutely love it"}
{"text":"Excellent! Great evening at this fine establishment. It was customer appreciation day with loads of food, great cheap drinks in the east end of the city."}
{"text":"So I had a great experience! 69 cent wings--69 cent wings!! 
But seriously the wings were really affordable and absolutely massive. I wouldn't come here regularly but if you're staying overnight at the nearby Radisson then it's definitely worth the 5 minute walk. I do have a complaint with the service. Our waitress got us our food really quickly and was actually very kind and polite. But she kept directing questions at my brother rather than talking to both of us and treating me like an adult. The restaurant itself could use a makeover but I mean it's a pub. You know exactly what you're getting. Their beer selection is a bit slim but they have a little of everything so you'll find at least something you'll like. If you're looking for an affordable place and are in the mood for wings, I definitely suggest coming here!"}
{"text":"When I venture north of Bloor, it gets harder and harder to find a well-yelped business.   On this occasion, a client with offices nearby suggested this spot for lunch as \"it's quick and you can talk\".   

It's a generic pub-in-a-box type of decor, with all the usual bits of pub grub on the 4-page menu.   I ordered Thai chicken curry (against my general rule about thai food outside Thai restaurants [or outside Thailand more importantly]) and my client ordered a special seafood Indian curry.

Quelle surprise!  The food was actually very good!  My curry was well-flavoured, didn't have the Toronto oversweetness, and actually included bits like lemongrass.   The Indian curry was also very good, with subtle flavours and moderate spice.  Who knew?

The food would have bumped Queen's Head up to four stars if not for the well-intentioned but sloppy service.   The waitress forgot no less than three requests in a 20-minute period and really seemed to be on another planet.   She was friendly, but it ended there.

If you do ever find yourself up here, give it a chance, and then head over to Hong Tai for some of the freshest, best-priced fruit in the city."}
{"text":"Dingy pub that is tailor made for the locals who frequent the place. 

I've been to Queen's Head Pub on a number of occasions and the experience just kept diminishing. The place itself is rather large and is at the bookend of a rather larger strip plaza that also has the Hong Tai Supermarket. As soon as you walk in, you'll notice just how dark and dim the place is (can barely even read the menu). 

The wings here are actually pretty solid. They do give out some giant wings and they have their wing specials on Sundays and Mondays. They don't come with fries, but it's fine because their wings are large enough to fill you. It comes with quite a bit of sauce if you like that. If you don't, then just ask for it on the side. They have some Asian influenced pub foods that include curries and thai chicken dishes, but those are every once in a while.

Service is hit or miss also. Sometimes you get attentive servers, and other times, you have servers who take a while just to get simple requests done (even when places are empty). Can't use the lack of staff as an excuse as you'll see 2-3 servers on a night where there is 4-5 tables max?

The atmosphere is nice for major sporting events like the NBA Finals and such, but even on a good sports night like Sunday Night Football, they have their crappy music blaring and won't change it to game audio, which I found disappointing when the place is pretty empty anyways.They've got some decent specials, which is why I kept coming, but there are much nicer places around with better food and service."}
{"text":"This place is good at serving drinks. 

This is the first time I've eaten at this pub for a group lunch and decided to order a simple dish - chicken fingers and yam fries. How could anyone mess up that order? Well first they took forever with the food order and then they serve it with sour cream, not plum sauce. Sweet potato fries were soggy and salty but chicken fingers were what I expected.

Overall, this pub lacks speed and quality unless you are only consuming beer with a large group.

Do yourself a favour and check out the smaller King George pub in the next plaza (next to the Wendys)"}
{"text":"Look, this is a really basic pub with simple food. The beer selection is ok and the staff could use some training in service. But the bottom line: it's a cheap place to grab a few drinks with friends and watch the game. If that's all you need, this place is great. If you're looking for a great dinner, look a bit further."}
{"text":"I used to think this place wasn't bad. I liked how they had daily menu and specials but now it's just absolutely awful. 

I went on the weekend for drinks, on a Saturday afternoon it was dead in the dining room and some guys at the bar. Our server looked like she just went to the gym for a workout and showed up here to work. Not very professional, I couldn't really tell she worked here. She was too busy talking and chatting with the people in the bar to really pay any attention to my friend and I. 

We ordered a pitcher of beer and when it arrived there was stuff floating in the pitcher. She rudely exclaimed \"where am I looking\" as if she didn't believe us or something. Also the glasses we got were filthy dirty. The fries we ordered were decent but who can really mess up on fries. This place really has gone downhill. I highly doubt I will come back. Don't waste your time here. I rather pay more and get decent service plus food or drinks where I don't have to worry about if I will end up getting sick after."}
{"text":"So we were looking for a spot to watch the UFC event since our regular spot wasn't showing it. We tried wild wing last time but there weren't enough tvs - maybe we just had a bad seat though. This time we decided to try Queens Head since it was semi close by. I called ahead to ask if they were showing it and she said they were but she didn't tell me there was a $10 cover/person. Anyway the first thing we noticed was all the TVs everywhere, including a large projection screen. There are so many that there probably wasn't one person who had to strain their neck to enjoy the fights. There's lots of items on the menu from Pad Thai to wings, maybe too many because I overheard a waitress telling some people (guess friends of hers) not to order this or that because \"it's absolutely disgusting\".  We started with an order of calamari which was cooked just right but the portion was the smallest order I've ever seen...it came out on a saucer - and cost $9!! What a rip. Whatever, we stayed optimistic that the rest of our order will at least be worth it. We always get wings for a fight so we went with an order of honey garlic and mild, although they brought the medium or hot but it didn't bother me so I didn't say anything. The fries were pretty good the wings ok but def not in the top 20 in the city. I had one wing (see pic) that had just a little bit of meat, I had to closely inspect it to make sure it didn't accidentally end up on my plate after it was on someone else's. I brought it to my servers attention but nothing was done about it - not that I expected something but come on kitchen staff don't send stuff like that out. she said 'maybe they just put a bone in' implying for flavour. Lol WTF it's chicken wings not chicken stock why would they add bones? I will admit that our waitress was very friendly, the other table's maybe a bit too friendly (this was the one who was telling them not to order certain things) as she was enjoying shots with them and loudly taking with them like 'f'n this and f'n that. Not to mention her thong hanging out every time I glanced over. I mean I know it's a pub and I swear maybe more than a lot of my friends but it felt like we were at some trashy low class dive.  Oh yeah, no refills on soft drinks which ended up costing us $15.  Including the $10 cover per person and tip, we paid over $75 for just two of us. I will never go back to this place for their subpar food. I haven't walked out of a restaurant feeling this dissatisfied in a long long time."}
{"text":"This was one of those places I'd always pass and think it must be a great bar. I finally ventured in on a Friday night around 10:00 after dinner with a few friends. It was still fairly empty here surprisingly. We received dinner menus and had to ask a second time for the drinks menu as we had already eaten. There's a lot of drink options here but I thought they were overpriced for the amount you get. The presentation of them weren't great either. The service was good but that's because it wasn't bustling with customers. The \"frozen mudslide\" and \"after eight\" drinks were pretty good, but tiny. The calamari was reasonably priced but soggy. In general, it was just an okay experience. Not a very good environment and the washrooms were quite bad."}
{"text":"I went to Queen's Head at about noon on a Saturday for lunch with some buddies, and as avid pub goers, we were extremely disappointed. 

Our food all came out at different times (one was almost done his meal by the time the last plate came out... and there were only 5 of us). 

Our drinks took about 10 minutes to get to the table (there were maybe 10 people in the entire restaurant).

The caesars were the worst I've ever had -- ever! No flavour at all! 

My meal was cold (Buffalo chicken wrap). Fries also. You could definitely tell that all the meals had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while before they got to the table.

The only nice things I have to say about this place is good drink prices, friendly server, and good tvs for sports. Otherwise, not an enjoyable meal, slow service, and bad caesars. Will never go back. Sorry Queen's Head!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was greasy except the salad. The fish and chips disintegrated due to freezer burn. The chicken fajitas were oozing with grease. The staff were friendly but very slow. The drinks were mostly ice. 

In short, I would recommend this place... for my worst enemies."}
{"text":"Crappy pub! The food is garbage and the service is slower than I've ever experienced! No one seems to care that you're there. I'd never return."}
{"text":"Seriously, which eatery does not offer free soft drink refills these days? Well apparently this one doesn't and it's enough to dissuade me from going there again."}
{"text":"I've never been on a busy night so the service has always been rather prompt. The menu is weird though and the random Thai selections doesn't fit the \"Sports Bar\" vibe you get when you walk in. They do have pretty great wings and one of the best grilled cheese sandwich variations I've ever had."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, approaching the door we were greeted by a bouncer?? He told us they're would be a $10 cover to watch the UFC game. None of our party of 4 even knew there was a UFC game on tonight. We told him we were just here to eat....he said once we left by 9pm we wouldn't have to pay....Extremely put off by this I almost wanted to leave but because it was raining out we just decided to stick it out.

The pub was pretty empty for a Saturday night or maybe the cover charge detered everyone else... However there were lots of tvs playing sports games and a big projection screen in the centre airing sports games too. I'd say its a good option if you were coming to watch a game and the volume level on the tvs were pretty loud + with all the screens theres no way you'd miss a play.

We decided to sit on the bar side. Pretty standard pub decor. Our waiter brought over the menus and the specials of the day. It was about 7:45pm so no time for leisurely eating we had to be out by 9pm!
Our waiter came back to take our drink orders and then we were ready to order.

Appetizer 

Cheese Perogies - Served with caramelized onions, bacon bits and sour cream
Your average perogies came out piping hot and crispy but not golden...lots of bacon bits but nothing spectacular

Mains

I ordered the 
Steak sandwich w/ onion rings - Cooked medium rare topped with cheese and sauteed mushrooms and onions. The steak was cooked well with good flavour, only thing was there was a lot of fatty bits surrounding my steak. The bread a little too bulky and crunchy for the sandwich, making it diffcult to eat. Onion rings were average.

Two people in our party ordered the 
Butter chicken with naan, papadum, and basmati rice.
It was a nice presentation, the curry wasn't bad a little kick to it was good chunks of chicken.

Shepherd's pie w/ garlic bread and a side of fries 
Pretty good, nice portion, fries tasted really good, fresh cut, golden brown.

Food took a little too long time to come out considering we were on a time crunch and the restaurant was pretty empty, maybe 10 others max. We were out of there with about 10 minutes to spare. However our waiter was really nice and even volunteered to take a group picture for us w/o even having to ask."}
