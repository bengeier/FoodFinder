{"text":"Hands down the best baked goods and they just so happen to be gluten free which makes them that much better! I highly recommend ordering from Lemme Eat Gluten Free sweet lady and yummy treats!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love all the GF baked goodies. Yum yum yum . My personal favorite is muffins. My sons personal favorite is the scones."}
{"text":"I contacted Lemme Eat Gluten Free for a dessert that was gluten/dairy/egg free.  They were very helpful, trying out several recipes before coming up with one that would taste great and meet my friend's strict dietary restrictions.  I have to admit, having no dietary restrictions myself, that I was skeptical that brownies without all those ingredients could be delicious.  Boy was I wrong.  These brownies were moist, chewy and very flavorful.  My friend was so excited to finally be able to have a birthday dessert she could actually eat that was delicious too.  I am really impressed!"}
