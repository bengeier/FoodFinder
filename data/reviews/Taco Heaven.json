{"text":"We ordered our food through campusfood.com and were told that it'd be a 45 minute wait. After an hour, we called and they said the delivery guy was running late. Ok, that's forgivable. When our food finally arrives, it is lukewarm and incomplete. We call back and the guy who speaks with us was extremely rude about THEIR mistake."}
{"text":"3 stars for effort, 2 stars for execution.  Man, the dollar off coupon would have made the dank nachos taste better.

I got the King Size Burrito.  Even before the burrito reached my table, I saw that it wasn't king size.   It wasn't even big.  It was fair sized, but honestly, that was because of the 13'' tortilla.  There was too much tortilla and not enough filling ingredients.  If you're going to describe a burrito as king sized and stuffed with things, please make it stuffed in a king sized way!  The problem wasn't so much the burrito but rather the expectations of the burrito.  Calling a place HEAVEN, you really have to not only meet but exceed expectations.  Simple things that could have made my burrito better: more beans and rice.  And lime wedges on the side please.  Cost me $7.75.

A friend ordered the Dank Nachos Supreme.  NOT DANK.  He, and I, was expecting the best nachos of our lives, and it was nowhere near that.  Main problems: not enough tortilla chips and too much lettuce.  Shred that lettuce.  Fry more tortillas up.  And please give me some homemade hot salsa.  I need it.  I also need jalapenos.  Where they at?  Cost: $8.25

This ain't taco heaven, this ain't taco hell, this is taco purgatory."}

It's a shame they had to go. They had the best tortilla chips I've ever had. In every other regard, though, the food was extremely average. And that's why they ended up going under. The dank nachos were more dank without all the shit on top; most of the food just wasn't memorable.

However, the staff here was the friendliest I've ever dealt with, always giving me stuff free of charge and charging next to nothing for things that weren't even on the menu. They were a bunch of stoners who were so hopeful about the place, and really tried their hardest. They truly had the best customer service in town. I wish them the best and I'm sorry to see them go."}
{"text":"Holy god what a dissapointment.  I used campusfood to order from Taco Heaven..... Campusfood I like.... Taco Heaven should be demoted to Taco Hell.  I ordered a Queen size Barrito and three tacos.  The Baritto was 90% lettuce and about a tablespoon of meet.  At first I thought I ordered a Vegi Barrito by mistake.  I tried three tacos.  The steak, chicken and ground beef.  Honestly I found it difficult to distinguish between them.  None of them had any real tast to speak of.... Kinda like eating chewy air.  Not a chance I will ever order from Taco Heaven ever again."}

Well, after my friend raved about the dank nachos, I just had to give it a try.
First off, when I called them they were rude...
Then, the delivery driver appeared on some moped thing and when he handed me the nachos, they were spilled out of the box and pooling in the bag.  I asked him what was going on and he just looked at me like I was the ridiculous one!  I should have just not taken them, but I am not that person...
So I took them in my house, put them on a plate and they were disgusting... I got the veggie ones adn they were a mess.  I love nachos and don't mind messy food, but these were just bad... Oh, and I got a soda, and it was warm... not room temp but WARM, like it was sitting under a heat lamp.
I said never again but I found myself hungry late, late at night again and decided to give it another go.  They weren't falling apart this time but they were just as bad.
The worst $10 ever spent."}
{"text":"So, I have to tell you...  I heard about some \"not so good\" reviews in the newspaper... but I thought I'd still give them a try.

Absolutely some of the best food I've had in a long time.  I walked in and was instantly greeted by the owner, who actually sat and talked to me for about 20 minutes.  I had the Philly Wrap and it was amazing.  (Yes, even though it's called Taco Heaven, they make a GREAT Philly Wrap!)  ...and if you're looking for an inexpensive place to eat -- this is the place for you, too...

I guess this has taught me that you really can't believe what you read...  if you really want to find out - you need to try it yourself.  Taco Heaven has my vote!"}
