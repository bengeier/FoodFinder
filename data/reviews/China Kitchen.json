{"text":"hole in the wall..definitely take out instead of dining in..food was made fresh & huge portions..fried rice was good..sweet & sour chicken not so much..general tao chicken tasted how dogs smell :( wont return"}
{"text":"We've go here all the time for Chinese food. Its the Best in Las Vegas and the prices are very reasonable and they give you plenty of it too!!!! You can go and sit down with  4-5 friends and all of you can spilit the family meal and all eat for $25 bucks and walk away full. Last night we orders a family meal $23 and I did not want the egg drop soup, so they offered to give us an appetizer. They did not have delivery til 5pm but because i called in to see about delivery, they offered 20% off the bill if i met them at the front gate of nellis afb. This place is a heck of alot better then PF.CHANG'S and can not beat the price. I love the orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken, the egg rolls are amazing.  I look back on my first impression of this place i thought it was a hole in the wall. man was i shocked inside is very clean and the food is delicious.Yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful!!! My sweet and sour shrimp had  raw batter in it. The food lacked flavor and freshness. If I could give it a lower rate than 1 star I would."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food! General Tsao Chicken, sweet sour chicken and spare ribs are my favorite! The girl working there is so sweet and always meet my needs!"}
{"text":"My first visit. Ordered two things, chicken chow mein and crab cheese wontons. The price is ok too.  The chow mein was ok. It needed flavor though. The noodles I think we're a bit too soft, almost soggy. Needs more cabbage.  The crab cheese wontons, they're really just cream cheese wontons. That was a little disappointing. But still tastes fine.  Will give this place a try again."}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelming experience as a whole. Neither my general tso's, egg roll, or egg drop soup were any good. I would strongly suggest you drive further or even out of your way for better Chinese food"}
{"text":"Terrible pork, pretty good fried rice.  I ordered the boneless spare ribs, and they were really floppy and overcooked/old. It seems that if you order something not often ordered, you're not going to get it fresh. The fried rice is pretty good though."}
{"text":"They have really good hot and sour soup! Very good value for your money.  I asked if they could make tofu with vegetables, which wasn't on the menu, and it was also very good.  Also, good orange chicken!  Rama Rama ding dong"}
{"text":"Ease of ordering and the delivery were great !! The food had one flavor and that was sweet, kung pao was sweet, generals tso was sweet, garlic chicken was sweet :( no spice at all. Not a lot of flavor. Vegetables were super crunchy and fresh though!"}
{"text":"Honestly, these people are so damn rude ! They dont deserve my money at all. And they are dirty people. I seen roaches run across the place and it is nasty !!!!"}
{"text":"I don't always eat Chinese take out, but when I do, I choose CHINA KITCHEN.    After trying Chang Jiang, and being completely disappointed in their bland food, I gave China Kitchen a try since it was on my way home from work and I will never look for another place to get some good ol' Americanized Chinese grub.  I can't say I've ordered a lot of things on their menu, so I can only speak from what few items I have had thus far.  I'm a sucker for pork fried rice and these guys really go all out.  I've never seen as much or as big of pieces of pork in fried rice before!  They really load it up, which is rare for fried rice.  I've also enjoyed their General Tso's chicken, which isn't overloaded with thick breading/batter that you can find at some places.  Also comes with broccoli which is nice.  Egg rolls are delicious, and can't really go wrong with crab rangoon.   Even on weekends, I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes to pick up an order.  They are always really fast, competitively priced, and the food really is good!"}
{"text":"Good food at a good price.  Food was just as good as Panda Express, but came with a larger serving.  No real complaints here.  Worth checking out if you are in the area.  Quick food if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  Egg drop soup smelled so unappetizing that I had to dump it out- smelled like rotten eggs.  Kind of spoiled the meal.  To be fair, this was the first time I've ordered egg drop soup, so maybe all egg drop soup smells like death?   Chicken Mei Fun was decent, needed to add a ton of soy sauce.  Veggies were sparse, chicken was flat and slippery.   Also got steamed dumplings which were actually quite delicious- not sure what kind of meat was inside, but they were incredibly filling and comforting, the dough was thick and pillowy. I will be trying a different restaurant the next time I want Asian food."}
{"text":"Since moving to Madison, I have been in search of a decent Chinese food option. I don't need the food to be absolutely to my liking, but I do appreciate the effort that China Kitchen puts into my order. A few things that makes CK above the rest here on the west side of town: you can order right here on Yelp with minimal trouble, you can pay either in cash when the food comes to your door or you pick up OR you can pay via a credit, debit or Paypal, which is so convenient. As mentioned in previous reviews, the delivery fee is only a dollar, which is terrific. Our family has been very happy with our past two orders, as we get a nice assortment of crunchy vegetables with our every entree."}
{"text":"As time winds down before I head back to Seoul, I think about some of the things I will miss about Madison, especially certain restaurants. And one of those restaurants is China Kitchen, a fast-food Chinese restaurant on the west side of Madison specializing more on take-out than sit-in dining (but they recently did add 2 more tables for a total of 3). Even with my new diet and exercise routine, this is one of my guilty pleasures that I still cannot shake even after living off Chinese food my entire college career. The reason why? They make pretty decent dishes at more than reasonable prices. My faves are kung pao chicken, general tso's chicken, broccoli beef, and chicken w garlic sauce. I am in no way saying that this place ranks in the upper echelon of great Chinese food (check out Fugu downtown), but if you want decent food that is fast, efficient, and fair, then this is your place.  It's also nice that being a regular customer for more than a year now, the owners and I have developed a sort of routine or understanding of how I like my food. I took some pics for your viewing satisfaction."}
{"text":"I had the General Tso Tofu.  I love a good vegetarian chines dish.  The tofu was nice and firm, not that mushy silken tofu garbage.  The flavor was right on.  I'll be back for sure then next time I'm in the neighborhood on lunch break."}
{"text":"THE best Chinese restaurant in Madison! Food is flawlessly delicious each and every time. They offer  excellent customer service & very reasonably priced items.  I started ordering from The China Kitchen because they were located close to my home. I am now a life long customer no matter where I live. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had a great big craving for pork egg foo young and I been sick with a cold so I had them deliver. Not the fastest delivery but was nice and hot even though we live not that close to location. It's not place where there is space to eat, it's mostly for take outs. The few times that we did eat there, they were very kind to my elderly mother at the time. The food is always consistently good. I'm very picky about egg drop soup as simple it may seem. I always order theirs because it's one I enjoy. I have no need for the crunchy noodles that it comes with because it's just that good."}
{"text":"Close to home, and delicious. I can't argue with that. They have fast service and if you choose to dine in (which we haven't) they will give you a military discount. Also, we get 2 free eggrolls with a $15 purchase. Who doesn't love free eggrolls? They also have surprisingly good chicken wings. I love that they come plain, so you can dress them up how you like them. Great for parties! I was also happy to see that they were not scrawny little wings, but good sized. Although the building looks a bit old, the inside is clean. The staff is always nice, and I would definitely recommend this place if you like Chinese food."}
{"text":"Chicken chow mein was the best I've had in Vegas. It took a long time to get our food but we'll worth the wait. The cashier brought us drink cups with no charge because it was taking so long. Fried rice was a little bland and next time I will get steamed not fried potstickers"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. They serve like a Panda Express, but the food here is delicious. Decor traditional chinese restaurant on the lower end."}
{"text":"While the food may be reasonably priced, you get what you pay for. We ordered 4 different entrees, only the egg fu yung was anywhere near good. The sesame chicken was dry and stringy. The chop suey and mongolian chicken looked identical and used the same sauce. The mongolian chicken was just spicier. The gravy for the egg fu yung was the same sauce that was with the chop suey, etc. I guess if you haven't eaten decent chinese food then this stuff might be considered good. But for my taste it was terrible and I would certainly take a pass on this restaurant. Tom's Red Pepper is not too far away from China Kitchen and, while not the best, it is far better than this."}
{"text":"Always fast and good food. One of our favorite Chinese restaurants"}
{"text":"I ordered sweet and sour sour chicken with fried rice.  The delivery was quick but the food I ordered was flavorless. Very disappointing .  Just to clarify I was staying in Wisconsin for business... so yes I am reviewing the correct place."}
{"text":"I just moved here from LA and this is the best Chinese food in town I drive 20 mins to this place when ever I want good Chinese food I really tried other place and nothing is worth going back to"}
{"text":"The dumplings are the best in town!  That is how my son tests a place.  I like cold sesame noodles and I think theirs is the best, too.  Happy Family completes the order and it makes my day.  Modifying an order is not a problem and the fresh, not greasy food, is a delight.  Unlike other places nearby, I never regret ordering food here."}
{"text":"It was hard not to like this place even though the dining experience was a little weird. I couldn't tell if we were going to be served table side, or if we picked up our food at the counter... The whole experience was rather awkward. But our food was memorable and plentiful for lunch, with lower prices than i paid for any other lunch that week."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!! Waited an hour and a half for our delivery, and the food showed up ice cold and rubbery, pretty sure they scooped the chicken right from the buffet's heat lamps and put it in a to-go container. When I called the restaurant to inform them their response was, and I quote, \"you want money back, you give food back.\" I understand delivery taking a little long on a busy night, but the lack of customer service sealed the deal. I repeat, DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit. They created a dish not on the menu when my husband asked about something we hadn't had in years. The fish was perfect. The good was fresh, and our server was delightful!"}
{"text":"This is very basic Chinese-American food, but friendly service and very consistent. Lunch specials are dirt-cheap during the week. Love the Broccoli Beef"}
{"text":"Hot, made to order, correct customization every time. The couple working here are nice and working efficiently which means piping hot Chinese food in 15 minutes for carry out during peak meal times."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food places on the North Side. Huge plates and fast.  I've been coming here for years and the food is great. If your in the area this is a must go to spot."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service. Ordered food for delivery. After 45 minutes of waiting, I called and the person who answered the phone said \"We busy.\" She told me it'd be another 45 minutes. I told her that's ridiculous to wait 1.5 hours for 2 dishes and 1 appetizer to be delivered. I said if it isn't here in 15 minutes we are cancelling our order. She said \"No, 20 minutes, we busy.\" She was the rudest person and if I would have known this was the service I never would have ordered from this place. Take your service elsewhere. Cheap Chinese food is a dime a dozen and this place isn't worth the dime."}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! And the kids helping out the family restaurant is cute! Beef and broccoli is my fav!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times since they opened. NEVER had a bad dish. Love the General Tao's chicken. Just wish there was one on the west side of town."}
{"text":"I ordered online and it came to my house in about 20minutes! That's so speedy! I ordered the Sesame Chicken special that came with fried rice and an egg roll. I also ordered the chicken noodle soup. There was definitely more chicken and noodles than actual soup. Next time I'll stick with the wonton or hot and sour soup. There was definitely enough for lunch the next day. I'm so glad the ordering online through their website was so quick and easy. It's only an extra $1 for delivery. Minimum is $10. That's pretty decent."}
{"text":"Got the dinner for one. Egg roll was mushy and gross. Crab wanton was the same. Shrimp had this strange sauce, that was almost clunky. Rice had this really inedible flavor. I was so hungry too. Picked at it as much as I could, but I am pretty sure that was the worst Chinese food I've had in my life..yep, pretty sure."}
{"text":"My family of 65+ old family members never had chinese food. Got them general tso, sweet and sour chicken and beef and broccli. They loved it and want more. This is a family built on kielbasa Kroutt and potatoes"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT but :( the whole mall is gone!  So unless someone can find it has moved you are out of luck..."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. the one who was serving us was very professional. it was the best Chinese food I've had in a long while. especially for the price. I will be coming back here for the foreseeable future. There's plenty of free parking. I especially liked the orange chicken and fried rice."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. General Taos chicken and the chicken and broccoli are done right. All plates come with fried rice and a egg roll. The meals are very cheap! Give them a try if your in the area"}
{"text":"Fan friggen tastic!!! It's so yummy!!! And the whole restaurant is clean. The person taking my order was extremely nice. Husband can't stop raving about how good it is!!! Will 100% go there again."}
{"text":"I can't really say much with their other dishes, because we come here for the fried rice. Shrimp fried rice and vegetable fried rice are staples in our household. I am easy to please when it comes to fried rice. Serve me up some crunchy vegetables, shrimps that are not overdone, and eggy rice with just enough grease that it would not make my belly hurt.   Prices are cheap (between $7-8 bucks for heaping servings of fried rice) and fast (5-10 minutes tops). Did I say I love fried rice?"}
{"text":"$4.95 for pineapple chicken. Came with fried rice and egg roll.  Decent pieces of chicken. Big chunks of delicious bell pepper, onion, and pineapple. Fried rice and egg roll were just ok."}
{"text":"Good food Fast service.  Prices are reasonable  They have quick delivery as well- lunch specials"}
{"text":"Need something quick and cheap for lunch? China Kitchen is the place for you.  No need for reservations, come as you are and be served up a hot plate of already prepared food. Nothing fancy, but meeting the above criteria, who needs fancy?"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is lacking.  There is a young guy that serves, but he doesn't focus on the customers.  They had two great waitresses awhile ago, but I don't know where they went."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Great prices. Experienced good service. Went here for lunch on a Sunday. It's hard to find good Chinese food and this place is great. Will definitely come back. Area is a little sketchy but other than that the food was really good!"}
{"text":"I always have their garlic chicken chow mein. Fairly decent, the only complaint is sometimes you get a smell but that is due to the bad sewage system las vegas has. I'd reccomend this place for great chinese food."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is, the food or the value that makes me like it so much.  But I can't stop coming back for the barbeque ribs (which aren't ribs but are pork slices in the delicious red sauce that only Americans probably love).  Foodies will poo-poo this place but it is their loss.    This is takeout and delivery only."}
{"text":"First time at China Kitchen for takeout. We ordered a General Tso's combination, a Beef & Broccoli combination and an order of Crab Rangoon. The combinations came with one egg roll each. Putting it against all of the Chinese takeout food we've had in the past, it was good! The order was placed and was ready for pickup within 10 minutes. Everything was piping hot when we got home. The chicken and beef were spot on and the Crab Rangoon had plenty of filling. Less than $20 and there was plenty of food. For a quick Chinese fix, this place was a great choice!"}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food, great priced, great tasting food and good quantity, if you live in Lagrange definitely try it."}
