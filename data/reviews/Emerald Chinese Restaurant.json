{"text":"I've been here a quite a few times over the last two or three years and something has definitely changed. The quality of the food has gone down hill and the prices are ridiculous! 

Today I went with my husband for lunch and we were disappointed! The food was cold and on four occasions after we ordered the dim sum, the woman said \"okay let me warm it up for you\" and proceeded to the back to microwave it! What the heck?! Why are they pushing around cold dishes?

When we asked for shrimp rice rolls, the waiter put in the order to the kitchen - we thought \"great! at least it will be fresh\". Well... when they came out we wanted to send it back. The roll was gummy and falling apart. Not pleasant at all. 

$40 for seven dishes, four of them microwaved, one of them barely edible - just not a good meal. Should have gone to Manchu Wok."}
{"text":"We came all the way from New York to try this restaurant because it was recommended by some friends.  However, this is the worst Cantonese restaurant I've ever been to.  We went there for lunch. Food was so bad -- the beef tasted like it was marinated in some kind of chemicals.  I had pretty bad diarrhea after eating at this place.  Price was expensive and service was lousy.  Will absolutely not go there any more."}
{"text":"One of the gauges of a good Chinese restaurant is the number of Chinese people who patronize the place. Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patrons.

My wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch (9:00 AM ~ 11:00 AM) on weekends. The food is great, the place is clean, and there is ample parking around the restaurant. From within the restaurant, you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass. This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do not.

*The ideal time to come on weekends is between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet. Come after 11 AM, expect to fall in line. 

The staff is efficient, but do not expect a lengthy conversation. For a place like this, this is not a put down. It's what I expect.

The quality of the dim sum is comparable to what you'd get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh. Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts. The turnaround is pretty quick (a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables) so very seldom is the food going around for too long. My personal favorites are the sweet pork - served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry, chicken feet, shrimp - served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap, pork and century egg congee, and the douhua (silken tofu) with syrup. My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodles.

There may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you, then this place is difficult to beat."}
{"text":"Food was awesome but the service was horrible. I felt like I had to hunt someone down to order items. Might try one more time due to the food being delicious."}
{"text":"Below average in most ways
Service quick
Food not fresh or quality - below average throughout 
Wonton soup bad
Large room
Dimsum lunch may be slightly better than normal dinner items but i doubt its much better"}
{"text":"Very authentic chinese food. Excellent service, clean, nice ambience.  The decoration is typical to fine chinese restaurants in China.  I have been in different parts of China several times, so I can truly know when a place is authentic.  The waiter who assisted us was very kind and trying and achieving his best to understand us and serve us good.  The food was fresh, tasty and good quality.  Everything seemed clean and ambience medium-medium/high class people.  Is the type of chinese restaurant you will enjoy if looking for authentic and fine chinese food.  Prices a bit high but the restaurant deserves it for the food/service/ambiance quality.

So far the best chinese restaurant we have found in Mississauga.  We took our leftovers home happily and definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I've been to many authentic Chinese restaurants in my life. This one is the best. The staff is very professional and helpful, the place is clean and the food is exceptional. There is one TV screen, and instead of the usual Highway Traffic-Camera and the Breaking News, they show clips of how traditional dishes are made in China. I will definitely be back with more friends."}
{"text":"Food was awful, I do like Chinese food, but this one was tasteless and smelled terrible. I couldn't wait to get my bill and leave. They call this thing restaurant. I wouldn't go there again even if it is only one place on the earth where I can get food. highly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been to Emerald many times in the past 15 years.  
They used to have pretty good dim sum.

Now that I'm old enough to form my own opinion, my view of them is somewhat tarnished.

1) the dim sum is often recooked and carted so often that it arrives cold

2) the carts have some of the most inefficient routes, such that it is impossible to get the dishes you want unless you get up and hunt them down

3) slow service - it took quite a while to get change for the bill.  i would have thought they wanted a faster turnaround rate.

4) they're not exactly cheap for chinese food.

5) this one really bugged me - last time I went, close to end of dim sum, and they cracked out the vacuum and started vacuuming right next to my table.  Not sure about everyone else, but i don't particularly want to eat vacuum dust, nor do I enjoy the sights and sounds."}
{"text":"Poor service, overpriced food.  Make sure to check your dim sum bill.  They tried cheating me and making things more expensive.  Very dishonest business and would not go back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Emerald. In fact, it's a destination, I rent a car to go there. It's that good. The selection, the delicious hot sauce, the pageantry. It's all there to enjoy.  It's the King of Dim Sum in the GTA as far as I'm concerned. It's always consistent and it's authentic.  I just avoid looking in the fish tanks."}
{"text":"Horrible service,
I went there tonight with my boyfriend because he;s passed by the place a couple of times and we wanted to try it out. We orders bok choy, chicken fried rice and some lemon chicken. When we got our food the chicken was hard and looked old like it had been refried. So i complained to the server, he didn't even acknowledge my complaint and just left. i told another server and he told me that  this is how they make it and left without even offering to provide a new one. Finally, a women server offered to get a new one and even agreed with us that it was old. But it took about 20 minutes and all we had was the rice and bok choy. By the time they brought it out we just weren't hungry anymore, considering we did not want to eat the chicken by itself and our rice was already cold. Only exception is the sweet older lady who served us the rest of servers were rude. One server, even went to the table beside us to check the bill to see how much tip a couple had gave after they left. We heard him mention tip as he looked at the bill and threw it back down angry. Disgusting, will not return."}
{"text":"this place is the best place to get dim sum ! the food is delicious and the staff is always welcoming and attentive to our needs, the only thing im not crazy about it the washrooms, and anyone who knows me knows I like to see how clean a place is based on the cleanliness of their bathrooms"}
{"text":"won't be back again
At most, only the coke was good. It's the only thing that came at the right temperature"}
{"text":"Oh boy have I ever got news to share here.

Have been to this restaurant regularly over a 5 year period.

The reason I ate here was for nothing more than the food. More on this later.

I noticed that as each year passed, the food quality and cleanliness declined. I was NOT SURPRISED that 5 months ago the Food Inspectors closed the place down. It is filthy. In March this year, I walked into the men's room to find a floor covered in vomit! In most restaurants, this would be cleaned up immediately.

From Day 1, I felt the rudeness and aggression from the wait staff. In particular, an elderly heavy set Waiter who actually scowls when serving or taking orders.

I once brought some European guests of ours fresh from the Airport for Dinner and they were shocked/disgusted by the rudeness. My friend asked the Waiter if he had a problem and if all Canadians are this rude lol! The bill was about $70 and we did not give him a penny of tips.

So, back to the service. This year I finally decided that I will never eat in this place ever again. 

1. The people are R U D E !!!

2. The place is dirty

3. Overpriced 

Those of you who are into Holistic life, you can feel the bad energy in the room.

Stay away!

PS unfortunately YElLP 's lowest rating is One star so I give it accordingly. In reality it deserves NO STARS!"}
{"text":"I would say Emeralds has worsen over a period of few months, honestly, the service here was never the greatest, but now it has gotten to the point where the employees barely know any english! 

Also, they served us with dumplings that have gone bad, and were very sour in taste.  Meh, I wouldn't really care however, they charged us for it?!? So I have to pay to eat dumplings that may prove to be a health concern?  

...At least the washrooms were clean... :P"}
{"text":"We used to go here quite a bit for dim sum, but lately we've been going elsewhere.  Today we found ourselves there for a last minute family dim sum brunch.  I was reminded of why we don't really go there anymore...

1)  The layout: Depending on where you sit, you may get hot dim sum fresh off the carts, or you may get that cart that has \"onesies\" of everything left over....which implies you may have to wait quite awhile for that one item you've been jonesing for.  You could order it too, but that can take some time.  

2)  The quality:  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's meh.  It's rarely excellent. 

3)  The wait:  OMGoodness.  On a Sunday morning at noon, you can expect a hefty wait especially if you're in a group larger than 4.  I don't even attempt Saturday morning.  I'd have to assume that the rush dies down after 2 pm but don't quote me on that!

I'd say it's a good place to go if you're a dim sum newb and you like to see the items before you order them.  But otherwise there are better options out there."}
{"text":"The food is horrible. They should be embarrassed to serve this. Had lemon chicken which was certainly cooked and served days before, and rethermed for us. Completely inedible. Save your money and frustration. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"The phrase \"looks can be deceiving\" certainly applies here. Although the decor is nice with bright lights, white tablecloths and golden chair covers, it's ultimate downfall is the food. 

The majority of dim sum items were deep fried. Where were the steamed bamboo baskets and rice noodle rolls? Cart upon cart  of fried food came by multiple times before we even had one rice noodle roll cart. Even the rice noodle roll was disappointing. Good rice noodle rolls have a very thin skin. These were very thick. 

I asked one woman pushing a cart what dumplings she had and she said one was a \"shrimp biscuit\". I was dismayed to find it was one tiny shrimp no bigger than my thumb completely surrounded by ground pork.

The staff were awful. Apart from yelling at each other from across the room, they were curt when we asked for more hot water and they were not very nice. 

One cart lady got impatient and annoyed when we called her over to our table after she skipped us. After asking for the fried noodles on her cart, she stamped our card, then said she would get us a warm plate. She disappeared, and we didn't see her again. We were about to ask someone about this, when another lady came with a plate of noodles. They were microwaved!!!! 

I think it's safe to say I'll never come back here again. There are so many other good dim sum places (Richmond Hill/Markham) that are definitely worth the drive. Do yourself a favour and don't eat here."}
{"text":"Dim sum is great - try to get there between 11:00 and 11:30 on the weekend. Too early and the food is not as fresh and too late means waiting for a table. Waiters are great in helping to get the cart you want to stop by you. Dim sum us supposed to be a longer, family experience but with 3 young kids, speed is important and we find it pretty speedy usually. 

We have an Asian friend who insists on going to emerald for dinner when in town. With her ordering the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times but will never go back. Reason is the excruciatingly long wait for carts and carts that all seem to be missing standard favourites like Har Gow, Sticky Rice and Siu Mi. Inquiries about when those items might be appearing are simply met with \"later\" or \"soon\" meanwhile the congee and desert carts have just come around for the seventh time. 

Making a special order for any items will result in about a 30 minute wait not even kidding. The food off the carts is more often than not cold which doesn't help. 

Basically they have enough Dim Sum carts for a restaurant a quarter of the size. Its actually quite comical watching other diners constantly looking around for carts and crying out in unison \"Where is the food!\". 

If you want to wait over an hour just to get a few standard Dim Sum dishes that are available quickly anywhere else than go for it. Last time I was there I gave up and left after an hour and twenty minutes after having only eaten half of what I came for."}
{"text":"The service was nearly non-existent and extremely rude. Had 3 or 4 different servers come to our table and they would literally throw our plates on the table and leave without saying anything. Our food came out one at a time (there were 8 of us) and there was probably 5-10 minutes in between each order. It really was that bad. Funny how all the other tables around us got great service and their food delivered in a timely fashion and all together. NEVER going back"}
{"text":"I travel all the way from Thornhill to Mississauga just to eat at Emerald because I enjoy the traditional experience of eating dim sum. I find that the food is always fresh and there is always new items every time I go there. The servers are friendly and there's good customer service. The cha siu and the peking duck are a must when you go. I highly recommend dining at this restaurant when you're in Mississauga and looking for authentic Chinese food. Plus there is FREE WIFI"}
{"text":"Years ago, they were great.  Not much of a fan of their food anymore.  I don't go for dim sum, but rather actual dinners.  Haven't been impressed with their cost as it seems to be rising, despite being busier than I can ever remember."}
{"text":"Horrible place extremely dirty. Could not drink water cuz glassses were gross. Service was v bad cold food served. Don't ever ever go there."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. The food is extremely authentic, and if you come for lunch it literally arrives in seconds. My favourites are the chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, and congee. 
  I understand that most people complain about the service, but you have to understand that this isn't your typical American sit-in restaurant. 
Overall great place for dim sum and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible  ..,. just awful 
Never go back again 
Overpriced and low quality food and service"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a few days ago. Ordered two dishes from the \"create your own set dinner\" menu - the braised beef brisket and tendon bowl and the soft scrambled eggs with seafood. Came with house soup (???) and dessert (??? and orange slices).

The braised beef was very good, if not a bit oily. The brisket was fall apart tender and the tendon was perfectly cooked - not too mushy and not too crunchy. The inclusion of snow pea shoots was a bit of an unexpected choice of vegetable (I would have expected a root vegetable, like carrots or turnips), but the snow pea shoots ended up being a nice counterbalance to the rich braising liquid.

The eggs were a bit uneven, with some parts being of perfect consistency and the other parts being a touch overcooked. The seafood (shrimp and scallop) was plentiful and tasty. My only complaint was that the eggs were quite oily (but it's kind of to be expected with this dish).

The house soup was a traditional slow cooked carrot and green turnip soup with preserved mandarin peel and the dessert a standard mung bean soup.

Service was on the slow side and they were stingy with the tea leaves. 

Prices were reasonable.

Overall an OK option for traditional Cantonese food for local residents... but there are better options if you go more west and obviously WAY better options if you're willing to go all the way east to Markham/Scarborough/etc."}
{"text":"Family's Go To Dim Sum place!

Always a good time here! People always complain about service ... but you should know what you're getting into. Its a dim sum place! 

The food never disappoints. I cant even name a dish that wasn't good. The cart dim sum give its that fun experience of the excitement of seeing the cart come by. Whats in the cart?!? Its great for kids and adults. The price has gone up in the last couple of years, but honestly its expected. The food never disappoints and i will be back. 

Recommendations:
- For weekends, come around 10:30am. Any later and you'll be trapped in a crowd of chaos! 
- The manager lady always tries to sell a couple dishes that she runs around with. Don't get them! They are usually the older items that wasn't sold
- Theres an automatic charge for \"tea\" per person, consider that when tipping 
- If there is a certain item you want and cant seem to find on the carts, just ask the people in the black vest. They can always preorder for you. 
- be ready to eat!!"}
{"text":"My family are regulars at this place, and we went today again during one of their peak periods (weekends during lunch). It was extremely packed - a pretty long wait time I would assume. Luckily there are perks to being regulars at this restaurant: less wait time, attentive service, and the tea surcharge is waived. 

I generally go here because of the hustle & bustle atmosphere and because the dim sum is relatively consistent in quality. Is it the best dim sum I ever tasted? Probably not, but I still enjoy it because it's still one of the best, most popular, and packed Chinese restaurants in Mississauga (it's always nice to go to a busy restaurant versus a completely dead one in my opinion - it indicates food is always made fresh for customers). If you want the most authentic dim sum experience in this side of town, this place is it! There's not many other restaurants that can wheel out fresh & hot food in carts throughout the entire lunch period (many other similar restaurants you have to order off a sheet, so it may take away from the experience if you've never tried this).

If you've never been to dim sum, I think going here would be a good experience. It's nice to have some prior knowledge of some Chinese food if possible. Some of the dishes I order regularly are: XO stir fried rice noodle rolls, spare ribs in black bean sauce, fried crab claw (a bit expensive, ~$5 for 2 but a guilty pleasure for sure), fried seaweed roll.

Only negatives about this place could be: long wait times, not for people who dislike busy/loud environments, not for extremely starving people (you might have to wait if you can't find something you like right away on a cart), specialty/large dishes are expensive, not very wheelchair accessible (I still found a way but the general layout of the restaurant/plaza isn't that friendly for wheelchairs)"}
{"text":"Bad reception from the hostess. We ordered items but were later told some of them are not available. We switched but when the bill came it still included the switched items. The waiter had to go validate.

Food was so-so, better for post bar consumption. 

Washrooms had not been taken care of for at least several hours, paper everywhere,..."}
{"text":"This is one of the few bigger chinese restaurants in mississauga. They have solid good food. Although in recent visits, the service has been lacking... 
My family and I always come here for birthdays, holiday and recently Chinese New Year dinner. 

In those few times, the service of our food has taken a very long time. The food does not arrive until 20-30 minutes after ordering. Not only that but they did not provide the starter soup. 

When we question the servers about the wait time, we received some lip. It was only when the managers came to serve us the service was a bit better. 

Emerald overall is a great restaurant, but next time we might take our family business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I had a great time in this restaurant! Came here for dinner with a party of 5! The service was very friendly, they didn't speak fluent English but you can communicate with them easily! The place is just OK, cleanliness is moderate but food was excellent! We ordered the lobster, sword fish fried rice, chicken curry, snow pea leaf with garlic and beef sauté everything was great! So tasty and delicious! I would recommend the fried rice and curry! The potion size is huge! It's best if you share!"}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum on a Sunday with a group of 20.  It's just your typical dimsum restaurant and it definitely hit the spot for me.  We got around 10 different dishes and everything tasted great."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. We were there for dinner. Food was good when it came but anticipate waiting for a long time. We were there during Chinese New year's celebrations and they should've anticipated that it would be busy. It was disorganized and chaos with servers and kitchen staff. All the patrons seemed annoyed with the service."}
{"text":"quick review of my dim sum experience at this establishment:
Food: 1/5 - I found all the fried food to be too greasy, taro cake tasted like chalk, the cold melon soup tasted like they used un-ripe cantaloupe
Service: 3/5 - the servers pushing the carts were friendly but the lady who took our bill was a bit of a witch
Ambiance: 2/5 - washrooms are disgusting, they need to clean the aquarium at the front where they keep the lobsters
Price: 1/5 - overpriced based on the poor quality of the food

...not coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"A great place for hangover lunch. The food is good and reasonably priced but can add up very quickly. Only a few servers speak English so don't expect a1 service.
Very lively restaurant around lunch time because of dim sum. It gets quite loud and rowdy but that's part of the fun. 

Overall, it's a good place to go for cheap dim sum in the Mississauga area that won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"I'm told this restaurant has been around for numerous years and the rest of my party were regulars here. Inside it reminded me of a typical Chinese restaurant - golds and reds, fish tank, things weren't new but not too old. There were a number of tables seated and the bigger tables around the edge of the restaurant were filled or had reservations.

There was a dinner combo set menu available as well as a regular à la carte menu. My table ordered off the à la carte, probably for flexibility in getting exactly what we want.

The soup came out first - it looked hopeful with greens and meats visible, but the taste was watery and bland. It was also apparent the service was going to feature kind-hearted ladies with fair-to-average serving skills as the soup ladling job was all over the place, literally.

Other dishes came out eventually, featuring sweet and sour pork, thousand island sauce deep fried pork, egg tofu with baby shrimp, garlic shoots and squid with chili sauce, XO sauce string beans, fish fillet with peas...a collection of fairly simple dishes that one could make at home, but would require a hefty grocery run to accomplish all in one dinner. Overall everything tasted good and nothing was poorly done, though the garlic shoots and string beans were much spicier than expected. There were no food-related complaints around the table otherwise. Dessert was sliced oranges and red bean soup - standard, nothing special.

I was impressed by the variety of dishes available at Emerald and satisfied by the pricing - my table of 16 came out to only $16.50 each for what I felt was a large variety of dishes. While nothing stood out nothing was utterly dissatisfying either, which is a great accomplishment given the size of my party. Personally - I felt more interesting and more flavourful dishes can be found in Markham and Richmond Hill, but for being in Mississauga it wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"This is as close as you can get to Hong Kong dim sum here in Mississauga.

I have been eating here for almost 10 years. Surprisingly I managed to write my review just now so I'm a little behind. The place is huge - banquet style seating. They are open pretty early in the morning and close very late at night so it's very convenient for a Chinese restaurant in the west GTA.

The choice is yours: Pick up dim sum from the carts slowly strolling in the aisles or order from their menu. From their \"Har Gau\" shrimp dumplings to their simple Rice Toppings, you can always find something good to eat here. When I first arrived at Emerald, I didn't quite know what to expect. It was busier than a shopping mall on a snowy weekend and I probably felt extremely overwhelmed by all the people waiting in the front lobby. What I have always learned is that if the restaurant is filled with patrons of its own nationality then the chances are that the food is very good and trustworthy. I am telling you all, the food is very good here.

Dim sum carts: Depending on the type of food that you pick out will justify the price you must pay. Noodles and veggies are cheaper. Seafood items are higher in cost. If you love seafood as much as I do, you won't mind paying for it.

Menu: I have eaten several items on the list here for dinner and they all taste great. If you order the crab, it can get quite expensive so choose wisely based on your budget. When dining here with out-of-town family or friends, I would always recommend buying the crab.

So what has put off many people is the very rough service treatment. You need to keep in mind that delicious Cantonese style food does not equal to quality service. As many people have often complained that it can and will be extremely busy during weekends and holidays, I'm listing several tips for all of you to enjoy the \"five-star\" eating experience.

Tip #1: Plan wisely - Weekend dim sum lunch hours is crazy busy and holidays is even worse. Unless you are absolutely craving their food, beware of rushed and rude service.
Tip #2: All your favourite dim sum dishes may or may not be on the carts. You can order dim sum dishes straight from the kitchen for the same price. But be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes for your order to come out. The same can be said about ordering menu items during dim sum hours. I have seen people walk out because their order never arrived after eating several dim sum dishes.
Tip #3: When you need some service, get their attention! Make eye contact and call over the staff wearing black vests. They are the ones you need to order from so don't be shy and call them over. 
Tip #4: When asking for something, no need to be rude to them even though they are rude to you. When speaking with us needy/hungry/polite Canadians during busy times they are very direct because they are trying to keep up with orders. Just say what you need and follow up when they forget. If you ask for too many things then they will make you feel unwelcome.

{"text":"I've been here twice. Once during Chinese New Year. They have good dim sum.

The second time my family went wasn't so good. The food was a little cold. We found a rubber band in the vegetables. The manager crossed off the item on the list after explaining what happened.

They likely did not wash the veggies since the rubber band was found among them. Is that standard in restaurants?

Despite the manager having crossed the item off the list, we still got charged for it. We had to talk to a few staff members until we found someone that could speak adequate English (the manager was busy elsewhere).

Dim sum was good, admittedly. The service, however, is not so good. I would avoid the place."}
{"text":"I went here today for dim sum and I love it! The dim sum ordering style may be outside your comfort zone if you're not used to it.
You order food as you see them come around on carts, flagging down workers and picking however many dishes you want from the cart. They will mark down the types of dishes you got, which will add to your total. Different carts have different items, but the same carts will come around quite often.
It's a great way to eat with your eyes, picking food that looks good and they taste good too! Highly recommend the deep fried squid tentacles, a light crunch on the outside but soft and moist squid on the inside!"}
{"text":"Vile.  This was one of the worst examples of food quality out there. The fried rice was just plain greasy but not fried and crispy like it should be.  The lemon chicken was HARD and a funny color - so disgusting.  It was dismal and inedible. I would absolutely recommend you MISS this place."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with my mom, who just moved in to the adjacent condominium complex behind the restaurant. 

This. Place. Sucked. I mean really bad.

My first instinct this was going to be a rough ride was the fact they there was no appetizing aroma either outside or when opening the front doors. My second instinct? The decor... Weird looking yellow chairs, ceiling has water/mold stains and the TV is showing Slice.

We were taken to our table by a middle-aged Asian man, who seemed to have a real problem speaking any language, as he spoke like Dr. Frankenstein's monster. There were other guests who seemed to have the same difficulty. Then another manager, this time a female, approached with a cart of items and asked if we wanted the spare ribs and chicken wings. We said yes, but then realized that she was just going to reheat the ones on the actual cart, that were sitting by the front door. The ribs were lukewarm and the wings were soggy from the reheat.  

Now, as for the menu... If you eat in as opposed to takeout, there is a price hike, supposedly because you are getting more food, so don't be surprised by the $15 chicken fried rice and about the same for curry vegetables.

The rice was just plain crap. No taste or color and the cabbage was slimy and not crunchy in the rice. The vegetables were the size of my fist (exaggerated), but damn folks, could you not cut them down to a manageable size?!

All that and I'm now $40 in the hole. No tip either, since we  had to pack our own doggy bag and took home whatever was left as to not waste and/or try to shovel it off to someone else. Failing that, trying to recook it back to some forms of dignity.

Shame on whoever cooks the food there, seriously.

The only plus? The cashier was real cute."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum yesterday (my first time) for lunch and it sure was a different experience. The restaurant was extremely busy but we still managed to get a table right away. 

The first thing I was confused about was how it worked. I saw carts of food all around but only later realized thats how they serve you. Also, I had absolutely no idea how pricing worked for this and had to ask a waiter. Even after that I wasn't sure as most of them can't speak English so it was hard to communicate. 

The food itself wasn't bad. It tasted pretty decent but I wasnt impressed with anything, just satisfied. We tried a few things (including chicken feet) which was an interesting experience. The spices on the chicken feet tasted good, but there was almost no meat on it (I guess that is expected but when I looked at the dish it looked more meaty). I wish they had like another chicken dish with the spices they marinated and cooked the feet in. 

Overall, the experience was something new to me but the food doesn't leave me wanting more. I was drinking water like crazy for the next 3 hours after as the meal left me extremely thirsty (MSG?) 

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you really want to try traditional dim sum once."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE! Dim sum was cold and had very limited option. So we ordered a stir fried rice noodle hoping it would be better. Little did we know it would take over 30 mins to be served and sooo not worth the time cus it came out lacking in flavour and had a burnt smell. 
But nothing was worst then the HORRIBLE service!!! Rude grumpy old waiters walking around ignoring you and giving dirty looks when u try to get their attention or ask for something.
To top off our EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT experience there we were given a bill of $75.00 !! For 2 ppl! I was charged almost $5.50 for tea that I didn't even touched! We've ordered way more at other restaurants and our bill usually estimates around $$40-$50.
Needless to say we are NEVER ever returning there, just even the thought of it sickens me, ugh!

(I'm only giving this place 1star cus I had to, if I could I would give them a negative one million star)"}
{"text":"Horrible dishes, tough beef and very dry fish. The portion is tiny and pretty expensive. They also charge $2.5 for a small bowl of rice. The service is also exceptionally bad. If I could give 0 star, that's what it deserves."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!! I wish there was a 0 star option so I could rate them. I came here for dinner with family. My father asked for extra chopsticks and the server asked him WHY he needed new chopsticks??? After explaining that he dropped his, and needed new ones, a pair of chopsticks (taking from a dirty stall) finally were given to him from across the table, BARE HAND. You probably have to know some Chinese when ordering food here, as most of the staffs don't speak English. I felt like we were begging for food and service attention at this restaurant; I don't know how about you, but to me, it just killed my appetite. We ordered deep fried oyster, sea-food fried rice, fried noodle, spicy scallop and pecking duck. And I have to say, these were one of the worst Chinese dishes ( I rated Mandarin 3 stars-so you know I am not a picky eater here). The rice was soggy, the spicy scallop was way too salty, while the fried noodle was just dry and bland. My dinner was ruined. I will never come back. Avoid at all cost!!!"}
{"text":"Meh.  If the ingredients were a little fresher and the recipes are a little healthier, it would be worth a review.  

MSG ME!  (No, please don't)"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum today with family, just me and 3 others. We went very early on a Saturday at around 10am. They were just beginning to roll out food and it didn't get busy until about noon. The dim sum selection was good with lots of traditional dishes that other dim sum places don't make anymore. I really liked the crab claw. It was pretty tasty, although not the best I've ever had. The same can be said about every other dish we had. Good, but not exceptional. 

Why won't I come back again? Because the bill came out to $80 with tip...and they charged me wrong originally so I had to go to the counter and talk to them before I got almost $30 refunded. The service was mediocre. A couple of time, the carts almost went by and we had to flag it down to grab something off of it. It wasn't the worst service, but it certainly wasn't memorable either, and at the prices they are charging compared to other parts of Toronto, I was expecting more."}
{"text":"I went at 230 on a Monday. It was dimsum 

I hated every second I was there, the carts were going around but the ladies kept ignoring us and I don't understand why. 

we got gar how & a spinach dumpling. 

After that not a single cart were go by and we sat for so long till I finally I gave up 

we went to pay and it was 14$ which is soooo high for what we got ...... 

I'll never ever go back ..

.. food was good though"}
{"text":"Four out of Five stars for a traditional Chinese restaurant. The decor and ambiance is what you would expect from such a place. However it is our favorite place to go when we have a hunkering for Dim-Sum. The food is fresh and tasty. Service is good, and price is right. A la cart is also very good and there are a lot of good traditional Chinese dishes, same as you would find in China. I enjoy Emerald. Ask for TsingTao beer with your meal, and try the pork belly and  and also the lobster dishes."}
{"text":"Very busy on weekends, but definitely more food and cart options then during the weekdays, when you won't catch yourself in line. Good food, the only Dim Sum in Mississauga with Sweet and Sour Pork Feet w/ Eggs (sounds gross, but its believed to be very nutrional, as the Vinegar in the soup helps purify the blood)."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience in my entire life. I'm not talking about the  foods, but the quality of service. The dim sum lady was rude, we asked three times to not serve food that we didn't want and she still ignored us. I spoke to the general manager and she seemed not to care or even at least saying sorry."}
{"text":"The food is okay. I don't know if it's kung pao chicken or the general tao but one of them tastes horrible. The lemon chicken however tastes very good. It's a normal tasting Chinese food that I find quite overpriced."}
{"text":"I used to work in Oakville, if co-workers and I wanted dim sum, this is the only place that's reasonably close AND offers decent food. 

My Dim Sum SSQSW: 

Serve Style -- push cart. I would have preferred ordering from a menu, but co-workers who aren't dim sum regulars like the push-cart style so they can peek before ordering 

Selection -- good, aplenty on seafood dishes (steamed shrimp dumpling, steamed shrimp with chives dumpling, fried shrimp dumpling, fried shrimp with chives dumpling, .... you get the gist). They have all the usual suspects for dim sum. 

Quality -- okay. Because it's always busy, we've not had un-fresh food. 

Service -- so so. I think they try to be efficient, if not warm and attentive. The servers are always in such a rush, who's got time to smile at or chat with you?! If you want something, just be assertive and flag someone down (in a polite way). 

Wait Time -- avoid 11:45 - 12:45 peak lunch time. Otherwise finding a parking and getting a table will taste your patience."}
{"text":"I'm writing this update based on the lunch I had here today. 

I'm so annoyed that the service is so incredibly rude. I can understand that they might be busy, and need to move fast. Sometimes they respond to me, but they look the other way, I'm okay with that too. 

But today we went, and I would ask people for tea, and cutlery and things, and they would put a grump face and storm away, only to come back with the minimal amount of things. 

I mean, we asked for hot sauce, and he just  violently squeezed hot sauce in everyone's bowls! I was shocked, and then so I asked for more bowls. And he stomped off and brought me just one bowl. (What about everyone else)

Some other servers are quite nice. If you need anything, try to flag down the guy in the suit/tie or the ladies in the black blazers. Anyone else will just throw things at you (figuratively)

They also again, tried to put stuff on our table, and I had to tell them to take it back. When she was confused what i wanted, I got yelled at. 

I think if you are a regular and they get to know you the service would be better. It would be the managers serving you, not the others. 

Nonetheless, the place is always packed full of the local asian folk, which is a good thing. I can understand why, it's cheap, and the food is quite decent (they can cook the short ribs a bit more).  This time with 5 people, we paid $11 a person. 

If it wasn't for the only dim sum place in proximity, and my co-workers loving it so much, I wouldn't come back. 
I really don't need to be treated like a 2nd class citizen."}
{"text":"Despite the poor service here, my family comes here for special occasions because the quality of their dishes is pretty decent. There is a wide variety of dishes and you can also order a 10-course meal if you'd like. The dim sum menu is also very selective.

But as mentioned the service is terrible! You'll expect to wait 20-30 mins for your food especially if you come with a large group. I know you cant expect good service from an asian restaurant but I'm used to the quick eat in and out type of meal and it's definitely subpar service here! The waiters are also not very friendly and give you attitude when you ask when your food is coming.

I only give this restaurant 2 stars because the ambience of the restaurant is nice and the quality/selection of food is good."}
{"text":"Their dim sum is a bit pricier compared to other places but their spring rolls have got me hooked!"}
{"text":"Came on a weekday morning with bf to avoid the weekend crowds and we definitely enjoyed our experience here

Food: 5/5
Ordered a bunch our staples: lotus leaf wrapped sausage and sticky rice, preserved egg congee, egg yolk bun. And they were all pretty bomb!
Employees were walking around with carts full of dim sums. Super Cantonese style
Some items in the cart are off the menu

Service: 5/5
Super friendly and funny staffs.Willing to explain everything despite the language barrier.

Environment: 3/5
Bit outdated
Lobby and washroom are particularly sketchy

Overall 4/5, will return!
And we were told on weekends, there are more variety of dim sums"}
{"text":"I'm shocked I haven't reviewed this place... This is my go to dim sum place on the weekend in the ssaug.

Who doesn't love carts of steaming bamboo containers being pushed around you? It's packed though. Go before 11am or after 1pm. They serve dim sum until 4pm on the weekends. Then it becomes a regular Chinese restaurant - I have totally made that mistake before, although their chicken wasn't bad.

This places charges for tea, so make sure you want tea before you ordered it. It can get pricey and that's how a lot of dim sum places get you!

I see some of the other reviewers saying how you had to be firm and you do. All the cart ladies want to pawn their food on you... Especially if you aren't Asian... Also, if you want to order anything off the menu or even get extra napkins, you will have to flag down one of the servers in the black vests. They take their division of labour very seriously.

You should order a side of the stir fry snow peas. They don't normally bring that out. It's solid!

My personal favourites are the scallop dumplings (they are known for their scallop dishes), seafood dumplings, chicken feet, crab claw and fried tofu wrap...

I'm probably going this weekend. Thinking about it makes me hungry."}
{"text":"One a few (that I know of) dim sum restaurant in Mississauga on the way to the premium outlets.

Come before 11am as their was a huge back log after that, even though the place is large.

This is a cart service place but a few items you have to order from the waiter (en.  Sui mai/pork dumplings which is a staple of dim sum food choices so go figure - they finally came and pretty small).

Any ways, had better (in Markham) and worse (downtown toronto Chinatown) so 3 stars is average"}
{"text":"We have been going here to eat for years, whether it is a celebration or just a regular night out for dinner.
I always continue to go here, yes the service isn't that great but I won't complain about the service, the place is always extremely busy and I think that speaks for itself...food never disappoints, dim sum, delivery, fresh authentic Chinese food.."}
{"text":"I've visited this place many times growing up - my parents have often used it as a go-to for celebrating special occasions and family events, and we've also dropped by for weekend dim sum many times. When you get right down to it, this place is basically a Chinese restaurant moonlighting as a banquet hall. Very elaborate and ornate decor (think gold seat covers), seating to fill a legit army (this place is huge - if you're looking to seat a large group, this is a good place to start), and good variety to the menu and dim sum carts. 

It isn't the cheapest dim sum spot in the area, but if your main concern is making reservations and ensuring space for a larger group of people, this is a safe bet. The food itself is pretty decent - food from the menu is a decent size, tasty, and comes out quickly. There's good variety to the dim sum choices, lots of dishes to choose from, and the carts come by often. 

Overall, a decent choice. Note: they also take reservations."}
{"text":"Have been there many times for dim sum and was always great. First time for dinner and the service was so bad!! Will not be back. 

Glasses were dirty with food stuck on them and fingerprints everywhere. Pretty scary. 

Felt like it was such a hassle to have us eat there. The wait staff constantly reach over you to serve or take away things from the table. It was an experience I won't forget anytime soon"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst. I like how it still have the authenticity of rolling carts with food. But the food quality is not good and service is bad. I asked for service for 2 times in a row and because of that, I was given attitude cause I asked him to get water once and sauce the other time. Because of the rolling carts food sometimes comes out cold."}
{"text":"Fairly good food. Lots of options for dimsum and they still have the carts. Dinner is also very delicious. We ordered scallops and broccoli, garlic gai lan, sweet and sour pork, ginger beef, crispy chicken and Cantonese chow mein. Also reasonably priced. $130 including tax and ti for 8 people."}
{"text":"Their dim sum and Chinese dishes are better than a lot of other Mississauga ones BUT the 2 stars is because last January (2010)  I held my engagement party here and we had worked out a \"deal\" because I paid cash up front and on the day of, which was one price of $1200 covers 5 tables of catered food,  \"taxes\" and tips, which is not bad. 

My parents went to pay the day of and I was having too much fun taking pictures to go with them. The manager the day was such a cheat and liar and told my parents the price did not include the \"tip' so my parents being as trusting as they are gave them an extra $200 on top of it?!?!? 

I also had given each of our 3-4 servers a red pocket for luck.

They also book ours with another huge, large party with a microphone so it was really hard to hear anything when speeches or announcements were being made, especially for two of my best friends and their parents sitting at the table closest to the other rooms. A heads up would have been nice.

I didn't find out til a week later when I went to ask my parents if they had change form the $1400 I handed them to pay with. SO mad and felt so cheated and my engagement night is now tainted with this memory. So since then I have never gone back EVER."}
{"text":"Horrible parking (actually had to park across the street and cross Hurontario).   Mediocre dim sum (cold and greasy).  Abrupt service.  And 50% more expensive than what I thought.   I'll stick to Tremendous, thank-you."}
{"text":"We saw that the rating was not that high, but decided to stop by anyways. A lot of Chinese restaurants with great food but poor service often suffer on yelp ratings, but the food here was not good enough to balance out the bad service.

We got there at around noon on a weekday and it was pretty full. It took a few minutes for someone to seat us. We ordered some dishes from the carts but realized we had no utensils. It took about ten minutes for us to wave someone over to bring us some. Although the guy who seated us asked us what tea we wanted, he never brought it by and it took another ten or so minutes for us to get someone's attention.

We got beef changfen, shrimp dumplings, spinach moon dumplings, curry octopus and meatballs. The skin on the dumplings and changfen was soft but too thick for the amount of filling inside. The meatballs were flavorful but not very tender. Only the octopus had both flavor and texture."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for dinner at Emerald Chinese after a Thursday night workout.

We arrived around 7:30pm and were seated after a short wait.  After browsing the menu and a brief discussion with our waiter, we ordered seafood noodles and a 3 item mix meat plate (BBQ pork, chicken, and duck)

The food came soon thereafter and it was hot and delicious.  There was large portions and lots of seafood in the seafood noodles and the mix meat plate came with good cuts of meat and the correct sauces.

After the meal, we received fortune cookies for dessert.


Food
The food was good quality.  Ingredients tasted fresh and dishes tasted well made.  Food is above average but nothing stood out even though I was quite hungry.

Price
Price is high in comparative to other Chinese cuisine, and comparable to large western restaurant chains.

Service:
The service is average to slightly below average.  A common malaise of chinese restaurants is poor service where the waiter/waitresses are overworked, impatient, unattentive.  Emerald Chinese is no exception.  The waiting staff at the restaurant appear rushed and impatient.  All our services needs were met, but the staff was rushed and grumpy..

Decor
Emerald has tasteful decorations, comfortable chairs and nice tablecloths.  There is sufficient room to navigate between tables.


Overall, we had a good meal with large portions, received average service and paid slightly more than we had hoped for our meal.

3.1 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Good dim sum, not too expensive, out in Mississauga but worth the trip. 

Our family spent many Sunday brunches here and I always love going with a big group so we can order a larger variety.

I think it's consistently good, not consistently great but good and clean and busy which means the food is usually fresh. When I lived in Taipei we would never eat anywhere where there wasn't a wait because that meant the food usually sat around. Which is a policy I usually stick to for Chinese Restaurants. 

I'm giving it 4 stars mainly because if I want dim sum in Toronto it's usually the place I think of first. But really maybe it should be 3.5?

Not sure about the service or non-dim sum menu so this review is just for dim sum.

I like anything with bbq pork, especially the bbq pork wrapped in thin sheets of rice noodle, and baked bbq pork buns. I also love the rice noodles with a side of xo sauce, wrapped sticky rice, Chinese broccoli and deep fried sticky rice ball with sesame or red bean paste and egg tarts for dessert.

Not sure how useful these descriptions are because I only know the Chinese names so I'm describing the dishes... sorry but if you've been to dim sum before you might be able to figure it out. Next time I go I'll try to update the names."}
{"text":"Just visited this restaurant for Dim
Sum.
Good variety. Pleasant servers .
Spacious and Good Food."}
{"text":"Its been awhile since I've visited this restaurant and I must say that this time around, I actually enjoyed the food we ordered. Its not exactly the best I ever had but comparing it to the food I had years ago at this place says a lot.

Prices are still up there in my opinion but then again a lot of produce are getting ridiculously expensive now a days.

Decor needs an update... if anyone cares. And also, theres a ton of seating in this place and the staff was attentive (its hard to use the term friendly because they weren't lol) when we came in and our service was prompt.

Parking at the front of the restaurant can be busy but theres more parking around the back if the front is full. 

Overall, not the best one in Mississauga but its not bad place to go either."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there is not many choices for dimsum in mississauga. This is our to-go place for dimsum. We dont go samwoo because we feel like Emerald has more selection than samwoo. Food is average some dishes are decent however some are not fresh. 

Dont ever expect a good service from here. They suck at services. The waiters/ waitress sometimes give you an attitude. It really depends on their moods to give you a good service."}
{"text":"We ordered the duck. It looked and tasted like fried plastic. I had a watery bowel movement 30 min after leaving the restaurant. My stomach did not like it either. I have decided. I will only eat Mandarin restaurant Chinese food from now on. I do not think I can handle authentic Chinese food because it is disgusting and poor quality meat. Lots of tiny bones in the meat by the way. I felt like I was eating scraps fed to dogs - and I paid to experience this?

Noodles I did not try."}
{"text":"Looking over the reviews, Emerald has mixed ratings. I can understand this. If you're looking for a nice sit-down with little interaction with your server: you're in the wrong place. If you're not very good at saying No, lol you're so screwed it's not even funny.

Emerald is (as has been described to me) a traditional Chinese Dim Sum place. This means you will have food thrown at you from all the servers, YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. 

There are carts of food making rounds of the huge seating area and they all have different foods on them. Yes sometimes you will see the same cart multiple times, you just have to be patient. The ladies (never seen a dude wheeling the carts) will often not speak English and will automatically put food on your table (for which you will be charged), so you have to say No multiple times. 

I highly, HIGHLY recommend going with someone familiar with how these kind of restaurants work or someone that speaks Mandarin. I had no idea what 90% of the food was. Luckily, the friends I went with knew what was going on and ordered for us all. The food is different, so you will have to pass your comfort zone and try new things. Sometimes the food looked like things I'd find growing between my toenails, but tasted like heaven should taste. Leave your inhibitions at home.

It is WELL worth it. I'm now a huge fan of pork dumplings (as seen in other posts) and glazed pork buns! I can even order for myself now without going all doe-eyed in the face of the waiters! (I'm pretty proud of that)

TL;DR: Go to Emerald with someone that speaks Mandarin or understand restaurants like this. Learn to say No. Leave your inhibitions at home."}
{"text":"Food is really good, the place is super busy during the weekend. I love it. Remembers me China :)

But I find the price too high for what it is. I still highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is really good.  There was a huge lineup on Sunday.  There was alot of variety.  More than many other dim sum restaurants.  if you are close to the airport, this will be a great place to go for dim sum in Mississauga.  It's only about 20min from the Toronto airport.  There is not alot of push carts left in the Toronto area.  Their prices are reasonable.  Four people can be really full on $50 for lunch.  

I used to live in Mississauga and this was one of the better restaurants in the area.  If it's a weekend, you'll have to wait at least half an hour at lunch.  If you only have 2 people you might get a table right away.  They have a few 2 people table that no one uses.  Most people come here in groups of 4 or more."}
{"text":"So, here's the drill: HUGE venue, I mean banquet hall with the matching drapes/stage decoration/chairs/table cloth kind of banquet hall. Full bar, no alcohol on tap though. The servers are kind of rude and snappy, but the service is very fast. As for the food: IT. IS. AMAZING! The portions are huge, absolutely delicious and cooked fresh, and the prices are extremely reasonable! I ordered the Sautéed jumbo shrimp and grilled vegetables as a healthy option, and the shrimp was delicious! It was perfectly cooked, very light, very big, very yummy, and there was so much of it I struggled to finish. My boyfriend ordered the sweet & sour chicken with noodles and they were both great. Definitely recommend for a fun night out to much with friends :) 

P.S. They serve you green tea in a little pot when you're first seated, and orange slices and fortune cookies after your meal."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today, but not for dim sum. It was for my nephew's baby moon, so a ten course was ordered.

This is not in my neck of the woods either, so I can't really compare it to other places in Mississauga.

Since it WAS dim sum hour, it was really hectic. At no fault of the restaurant though. Customer service was still pretty good here.

The food was average, we had the standard banquet dishes of crab claw ball, garlic pea shoots, steamed fish, crispy chicken etc. Nothing stood out, and nothing was terrible. 

We did order a few dim sum dishes afterwards, like chicken feet and siu mai. 

I can't comment on the pricing either. 

Overall it was alright, but like I said, I'm never in Mississauga, so I'd only be back if there was a function there."}
{"text":"Great dim sum. Free parking. Slow a la cart service but the food is great. 

I'm more of a quality over quantity kind of gal so if I have to pay a bit more for better tasting food, you'll find me here. The prices are definitely higher than dim sum places in Toronto's Chinatown but it tastes so much better! Their dishes are also more unique; there are a few that I've only found here and their takes on other kinds are also delicious. 

I never have to wait very long to be seated but the a la cart service is a bit slow. Helps build up the appetite I'd say. 

This is my go to dim sum place. You'll always find me here. Unfortunately, their wifi doesn't work but who needs wifi when you have good food?"}
{"text":"Wasn't that great. Taste of the food was blend. Not authentic chinese food. Ambiance very loud. Servers were screaming among themselves and they forget they have customers who are close to them. Been hurting our ears the whole time. 
Was weird seeing the lady server removing a fish from the tank to show a customer and kept talking with the fish still alive in her net. Since the customer didn't want it she kept pushing it. Then finally drop the fish back in the tank"}
{"text":"You might need to be rude to eat.

Emerald is a Chinese Restaurant that mainly serves as a banquet hall. The chairs are all covered with fake silk seat covers similar to an old banquet hall trying to look newer. This place is geared for very large groups. 

The food is decent but the service is geared towards survival of the fittest. For Dim Sum it seems that you need to make yourself very visible in order to get served. Occupied ladies wheel the carts around with no set predictability or pattern. \"Excuse me can we have some more mustard sauce\"? might be the way you might ask for some sauce. Here, you might have to say \"WHERE IS THE SAUCE?\" 

But if you don't mind being rude (because they don't) then you might like this place. Try sitting closer to the window if you can as the Dim Sum carts seem to frequent that area more."}
{"text":"This was terrible. I was forced to go there on a team event at work and it was quite awful. A bunch of people walking around in carts and you holler at them (better have someone who speaks Cantonese with you so they can understand) if you want something on the cart they are tagging along. I tried some of those foods that the workmates had called up on the table as we were haring the bills and everything from the rice, to the chicken, to every single thing was terrible! Maybe my palette is not open minded enough, but the whole design where you call on the waitresses with the carts (which I guess is Dim Sum) is not my thing...I wouldn't come back. When they took us here I was hoping it was an average North American Chinese restaurant or at least if they had some common North American Chinese dishes I'd be fine...it was too traditional in my opinion...either that or the people I went with ordered the food that is so. Either way, I left hungry and didn't like it at all!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food, iv never had a bad time here. Good portions, good taste. It is a tad pricey tho, if i might add. I come here all the time so I guess iv gotten used to the pricing. They open late almost every night, they close at 1 for most nights I think. Staff is friendly, but most of them don't speak alot of English, but there's one who speaks good English tho. I just don't like the washrooms or the hallway to the washroom, looks sketchy. There's fish tanks with crab and other seafood...alive tho. And it right along where people sit down, and sometimes the one of the staff comes along and takes a fish out of the tank with a fishnet, that's the only thing I don't like...why couldn't they put this anywhere else? I don't know
BUT overall good place, I'll still be coming here alot."}
{"text":"The dimsum here is actually alright. Food was good relative to its price. Servers were nice despite language barriers. Nicely lit and seemingly tidy/clean environment, with beautiful decor. Wasn't the best dimsum I've tasted, but it was good."}
{"text":"Because we are in Mississauga, I think this place is pretty good compare to other dim sum places around the area. Me and my family used to come here a lot, but nowadays we all so busy that we come here less.

The dim sums here aren't as fancy as the one in Mississauga China Town, but I don't mind the look. I just mind about the taste.

Tips: only a few dim sum need to order. Most of them are pushed out."}
{"text":"I was craving dim sum the day before so my parents took me out for dim sum today. We arrived around 10:30 am so it wasn't busy at all. However, it took a while to flag down staff members at the beginning of our visit.

Most of the food that we got were carted out but we also ordered a few items that we didn't see being carted out. It is a bit expensive because it came out to $55 (including tax and tip) for only the three of us. Some of my faves today were the scallops, shumai, noodle roll with shrimp, and the curry squid.

Overall, it was an average dim sum experience. Food was good but service was non-existent at the beginning."}
{"text":"Finally had reason to create a yelp account. Came for a Sunday night family dinner but there were 2 wedding receptions booked. Competing sound systems with loud music and emcees, slow service, and generally terrible experience. One star for the ok food and sympathy for the wait staff."}
{"text":"I usually come here when nothing else is open, especially during holidays. It takes forever to get your food, especially take out. I usally get there seafood and beef fried rice. Nothing special. Service isnt that great either.. but its the only place open during xmas and new years lol"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in the dining room looks nicer than most Chinese restaurants.  It's slightly dated, but there are glimmering chandeliers everywhere, Persian printed broadloom, and nice curtains.  

Having said that, washrooms could be nicer.  Again, this is another Chinese place where warm/hot water in the restrooms is not even an option.  Only ice cold water flows out of faucet.  And certain stalls are used as storage spaces for cleaning supplies.  I really don't like this.  It makes me question their cleanliness.

Food-wise, there seems to be quite a large selection for dim sum.  Service was also nicer than most places and the staff tried to find out what dish someone in our group wanted, but didn't know what it was called.  Initially, they brought the wrong dish, but didn't make a fuss when we said that that wasn't the dish.  They also took that extra step by taking out a binder, with coloured photos, in order to try to identify the particular item.  This gets them extra points!

Our table ordered so much that we were given 10% discount.

Would get more *s if the washrooms matched with the rest of the dining room.  Food is alright, I guess fancy dining room AND more selection tricks people into thinking that food is better than it actually is, but I find it just alright."}
{"text":"This is THE place for Dim Sum in Mississauga. Don't despair if you see a huge line up at the door on weekends, things move quickly. There is no rhyme or reason to the hostess numbering system...so just wait your turn knowing that it is going to be great food. The food is cooked in steamer baskets and walked around the restaurant on carts. Someone at your table has to take the key ordering position so as to flag down the cart and get the food on the table. The food runs out quickly, so don't wait for it to come around again, it may be a while or never! They do a great job with the staple DS fare: Har gow (shrimp dumplings), Shui Mai (pork) and sticky rice. My personal favourite is the scallops with garlic sauce. Try the Chinese greens, dumpling soup, and pork sesame seed buns. The spring rolls ( with meat filling) are awesome as well.
The best time to go is just before noon on weekends or on weekdays. Anytime after 2:00 p.m. is pointless as they will be out of most food items."}
{"text":"As far as DimSum goes these people work hard, that is clearly evident. Food is never far away, if you see something that you like you'd better get it because the place is packed and it might not be there the next time the cart comes around. The food is good although not the best by most standards. Most of the time the food is fried so you can forget about individual flavors. Thankfully there is quite an amazing variety of foods and it is fresh. I loved the octopus as well as the wonton. Chicken feet were available so the wife was impressed. We got there late(230pm)so DimSum was wrapping up and as I said earlier the staff were in the midst of transforming the dining room, the staff is on point!"}
{"text":"Went for Dim Sum when it was super packed. Their dim sum is terrible. Everything had corn and ham in it. I've never had corn and ham in my dim sum until this restaurant. The carts with the same food go around and around and around with barely anything new. The food is dead cold when you get it because they just circle around multiple times. We did not understand how it was so packed when the food was absolutely terrible. There was that one lady that kept circling around with the same cart with dim sum nobody wanted that she kept persuading people to get. Never get anything from her, there is a reason why she keeps going around with the same items (not newly replenished ones at that).
We noticed it was packed with a lot of non-chinese as well, not sure if their taste is different from what we are used to from all the other dim sum places we've been to our whole life, but their hargow and siumai were the worst I've ever had in my life.

Not worth the $70 we had to pay. Maybe their regular non-dim sum menu is better, but this experience has turned us off completely from going back."}
{"text":"Came at 11ish AM on a Saturday, and didn't really have to wait for a table.

Standard dim-sum service. Really nothing much else to say. Environment is quite nice though for a dim-sum place. Also it's cart-service."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Mississauga!  It might look a little rundown on the outside and the foods were absolutely legit and authentic.  Dim sum was outstanding; my family and I technically had stayed in Toronto for 4 days and we had dim sum over here twice already!  Yes, it was that good!  Presented with a wide variety of dim sum, savory and sweet, from the steamed buns to baked sago pudding dessert, wish I had more room in the stomach!  Dinner was not super duper but prices were reasonable and foods were not bad at all."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant for our Chinese New Year dinner. The menu has a wide variety of dishes. The service was par. We order the pre fix menu and some side dishes . The waiter was at first not acoomendating but after a discussion with my dad they agreed on what we asked for. The food was mediocre to good. Most dishes were hot and tasty besides a few that were a bit salty. Overall the experience was good."}
{"text":"There was no beef anything! Was there a shortage of cows?

I didn't even see har gow, where are the sui mai, what do you mean you don't have beef rice roll, no meatballs, no lava buns, NOTHING. What kind of place is this? This was a Saturday! Everything was just carbs."}
{"text":"This was the 3rd and last time we come here for dim sum. If you are not Chinese they sit you at the back where the carts don't come or the food is cold when it does. Waited 15 mins for the first cart. Service is poor and with the exception of the chicken feet which were great, the rest of the dim sum was mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent at this place for years, enough that the managers pretty much recognize my whole family. And I have to say, this is probably my favorite Chinese place for lunch.

First of all, the place is HUGE. My relatives have booked this place as a venue for weddings, events, gatherings, and we usually get a good experience. On some days when you come at a busy time, it's not that bad of a wait because of how many tables there are! I remember waiting in a line past the door a few times to be seated, but maybe this has changed?

FOOD! I honestly think it's great here, though it is a bit expensive for what it offers. I prefer the lunch dim sum, letting them wheel carts as you take your pick. It's nice because I'm definitely not a decisive person, so I usually just get the tastiest looking stuff on the carts. A favorite is the crap shrimp ball things (? lol), the siu mai, dumplings, they're all very good. I also love the green vegetable plates or the scallops here, they're cooked well and I've never had any rubbery or overcooked meat.

SERVICE is all pretty good too imo, a lot of the cart ladies speak broken English and a bit of a Vietnamese so it's not too hard for us. They're usually fast too, bringing drinks/sauces/plates when we ask right away. 



I would definitely recommend this place to people! The reason it's a 4 is because I find the dinner experience to be a bit disappointing; often our dishes are just warm or sometimes cool when we order them. However, I love coming back at lunch, I think the dim sum is a fun and tasty experience. Actually I go almost every week and I've not noticed any drop in quality, so this place will probably remain my goto Chinese lunch for now!"}
{"text":"Last Friday, my team from work went to Emerald for dim sum for lunch. I drove three of my colleagues over to the restaurant. My other colleague took two others. 

I decided to go against Google Maps. Sometimes, I wonder how useful it is to do a u-turn instead of turning left at the intersection. 

This plaza gets busy. We got there just before noon, so we were fine. 

We got a round table. There were seven of us. We got tea while we waited for the dim sum carts to cycle. 

We ordered a whack load of dishes during our first five minutes of being there! So much for pacing how much we eat. 

The dim sum was delicious. Some of my favourites are the following:
- Crab claw balls (so good, especially the meat in the claw)
- Har gow
- Sticky rice in fragrant leaves
- Rice rolls (shrimp and barbeque pork)

I had so much protein that I enjoyed the gai lan with fish. I ate more greens than the one sliver of fish. 

We split the bill. Each person ended up paying $22, which included the tip. I was good with it. My boss said that it was expensive. This restaurant accepts credit, debit, and cash. 

The dim sum quality was amazing. This restaurant houses a ton of people. At one point, a tour bus full of tourists came in. I would guess that it easily seats 200 people. 

I'd come back here again. It's fully licensed, which is another reason why I need to come back.

{"text":"What a joke. Service was awful and dim sum was terrible. Don't believe the hype for best dim sum in Mississauga. Go to Rol San in Toronto. Never coming back."}
{"text":"My family and I were at Emerald yesterday during the busiest point of dim sum traffic. All I can say is, it is total mayhem. There weren't any lines during the time we were there, but I believe that is because they churn through customers in a manner I have never seen before. The tables are smooshed together to get as many in and out quickly. I can't really blame them, I get it. When you have a good thing, capitalize on it. Though, this atmosphere creates a bit of a frantic assembly line feel that I don't particularly find enjoyable.

There is no denying that the food at Emerald is pretty good. When it comes to dim sum, they stand out among the rest as they offer way more options than any other restaurant. Their offerings are unique and plentiful in size but not in overall temperature of dish. Only 1 of the dishes we received were actually the temperature it needed to be. Again, a symptom of the style of restaurant. 

Service was perfunctory at best. Cart servers were like street corner merchants hawking their wares. Actually placing items on the table while explaining why you simply needed to have it (in as few words as possible).

Overall, 3 stars is being a little more generous than I should be. But the food is actually not bad."}
{"text":"We've come to Emerald for both dim sum and dinner before.  This review will be for dinner.

Our group of 6 arrived around 7pm on a Friday night.  The restaurant was about half full.  They seated us at a round table that was a bit lop sided and unsteady because it was a piece of plywood screwed to some fold out table legs.  We asked to be moved to another table since we saw plenty available ones and they obliged. 

We ordered one of the set menus for $88 which included:

- House soup

- 1 jumbo steamed crab in a light butter sauce with onions.  I don't eat crab that often but it's probably one of the best I've tasted.  Lots of meat, not too much work needed to dig it out.  The meat was very fresh and not overdone.  

- Cold jellyfish and roast pork with crispy skin

- Stirfry scallops and shrimps with veggies and jumbo mushrooms

- Fish and deep fry tofu

- Stirfry tung choi

In addition, we also ordered snow pea leaves with garlic and half a roast chicken.

Food came fast and super hot.  Portions were gigantic especially the tofu/fish and snow pea leaves dishes.  Although we did have to order bowls of white rice separately as it was not included in the set menu.

Dessert was included and it was cold orange slices and a warm sweet taro/tapioca soup.

Overall a fantastic meal and way more than enough food for 6 people.  We had 2 jumbo containers of leftovers with the bill coming to $140 before tip."}
{"text":"They charge you for tea!!!! My boyfriend and I came here for dim sum and when we asked what's this charge on the bill the lady replied for tea. How ridiculous, never ever been to a dim sum place that charges for cheap tea! If you're going to charge for tea make sure you ask if we are going to drink it! Bad service, and garbage food and ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"My family has been going here off and of for probably close to 10 years.  I'm almost certain it has changed owners during that time.  Anyhow, we generally try not to come here as it's not a great Chinese restaurant but it's one of the very few Chinese restaurants that can hold a large group.  

We arrived with a table of 10 and we had reservations.  After being confused why we were told we had a 40 minute when we had reservations, we finally sat down after talking to the head hostess for 20 minutes.  This didn't start off our meal on the right foot,

We choose a smaller 'banquet' meal for 8 and supplemented with a few other dishes since we didn't like the really big banquet dinners.  The typical complimentary soup came out and the service was clearly not interested in 'service'.  The soup spilled all over the place when it was taken from the serving bowl to the smaller bowls.  This behaviour continued throughout the meal.  Most dishes were just thrown onto the table while the waiter often just pushed people aside to get to the centre of the table.  The only thing that saved the meal were the dishes.

Though they weren't outstanding or great.... all the dishes were fairly well executed.  Nothing was greasy, oily, underseasoned, overseasoned, or burnt.  Steamed fish was fresh and light.  Chicken was cooked perfectly and moist.  Vegetables were nicely flavoured and still crispy.  The lobster could be better... it was on the scrawny side and it was hard to find any meat in there.  All in all ... nothing horrible among the 10 dishes we ordered.  

In comparison to the east end, this restaurant is probably just average but since we're in Mississauga, it stands to be one of the better ones.  It's too bad we don't have a great Mississauga Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Whenever I go here on the weekend, this place is super busy.  Expect to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  This place is also mutli-ethnic.  You will see people of all different races coming here.  This place is one of the chinese dim sum restaurants that white people like to come to.  

The food is decent, but it is pricey.  You can find much cheaper dim sum places elsewhere, but if you don't speak chinese you will be more comfortable coming here. 

Sometimes, depending on what time you come here, there will be barely any food coming around.

{"text":"***No automatic doors, not baby friendly!*** I frequent this Chinese restaurant before and post partum. Dim sum is ok, dishes at dinner time are huge, service is great, BUT there are no automatic doors! How am in supposed to push my stroller inside?!!!"}
{"text":"Took my parents here recently to celebrate a birthday and left disappointed. This place used to have great dimsum but now I no longer think it's worth the drive. The chicken feet was really good though, so many if I have an exclusive craving for that I'll come back. The service is a lot better rhan what it used to be and we were pleasantly surprised that the staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is one of the Cantonese restaurants that I frequent in Mississauga.

I come mainly for the dim sum lunch.

What I like is the food is still pushed around on carts just like in the old school days.
As a result, you get to eat pretty quickly on your arrival.
One thing to watch out for is because you are hungry on arrival, you might tend to over order! Like they say your brain is bigger than your stomach! 

However no worries here as we pretty much always take home the left overs for our kids."}
{"text":"Dirty, cheap ingredients, bad service most of the time.  How do they stay in business??!?!?"}
{"text":"I usually really like the dim sum here but my lunch here yesterday was a real letdown. We came right before 2pm so maybe the timing something to do with it but I'm told their dim sum is on till 4pm.

The har gow was the worst I've ever had, and I rarely get to say that about har gow. The shrimp was tiny, rubbery, and it tasted \"off\". I was just glad we didn't get sick off it. It tasted completely different from how they used to do it here so I'm not sure if they used a bad batch, but if so it shouldn't have been served in the first place. Another staple, the shiu mai, was also pretty bad. It was tasty usually but it was tiny and I'm not sure if it had any fish egg topping either. If it did, it wasn't noticeable. The shiu mai here used to be huge but it seems the owner is shrinking it every single year. Even the bbq pork rice roll was disappointing, there were tiny slivers of bbq pork in it. We also ordered some fried pork & veggie dumpling that was actually served to us cold. The lady pushing the cart never bothered to heat it back up for us I guess. Stuff like this should be basic! The only dishes I liked were the steamed choy sum with oyster sauce. The xiao long bao was also decent.

Overall, it seems like they're skimping on everything that costs money now. Despite that, prices are higher than other dim sum spots. That's not a good combination. I hope the owner recognizes this soon because it'd be a shame for one of the few good dim sum spots in the city to keep on this path."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ever been here and I was quickly reminded why I didn't come back after the first time. I came on a weekend after the lunch rush so the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Most of the dim sum I ordered I noticed was just pulled from a sitting cart so it needed to be warmed up - I believe they had to microwave it! The food is normal. You can get the same taste and quality type food at other dim sum restaurants and pay literally half the price. Some dim sum items are $6 a plate which I don't think is justifiable at all when I can get the same dish and portion size elsewhere for half the cost. I almost fell off my chair when my $70 bill for 2 people arrived at the table. I won't be returning here and wouldn't recommend my friends to go here. It's way overpriced."}
{"text":"I have dined a few times for dim sum and dinner.  I like their menu as there is traditional Chinese dishes and unique dishes.

They have set menus for dinner which have a nice variety.  The food always taste good, but sometimes the service is good and sometimes not so much.

I would return again as the food keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Nothing special esp for toronto. Probably one of the poorest dim sum i have had in TO. Selection was very poor. Service slow. And they never came to our side with food."}
{"text":"We've always been there on a Sunday so we were hoping that Saturday dim sum would be less busy. No such luck. We were surprised that some of the dishes were cold because it was so packed; I could understand if it was empty and the carts weren't circulating but every table was full. It took a while to get drinks and other items (napkins). The dishes were not of the same quality as they had been on other visits, but they were acceptable."}
{"text":"We just walked out of this restaurant and I would give this place zero stars if I could. It started out badly from the beginning when a member of my party asked for a fork and the server told them they couldn't have one until after we place an order - which is complete nonsense! After the food was ordered we requested hot sauce. The servers did not even want to take the time to let us finish our words before they walked away begrudgingly to get the wrong sauce. Next the food came, it was all lukewarm and mediocre at best. Heavily lacking spices and any semblance of flavour. Lastly to add insult to injury our bill arrived; We watched as all the other tables around us enjoyed their oranges and fortune cookies as their bills arrived that for some reason we were not treated to. I guess we didn't \"qualify\" for them?!

This is my first review and I felt so compelled by the horrible food and even worst service that i felt it was my duty to warm others. Go elsewhere! It's one thing to have bad service and good food or vice versa, but not both sadly. 

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"My family(15+ ppl) and I came yesterday to celebrate a baptism and my birthday. We got there and the reservation was under my uncles' name and they already choosed and paid for the dishes they selected for each table.  The waitress was badgering us appetizers/soups but we didn't know that it was extra.... most of it didn't taste really good especially the tripe/liver which made me gag.The basic Chinese food like the sizzling beef, mushrooms, chow mein was really good though. However, the lack of customer service pissed me off. My relative was going to pay but the amount of money they charged was crazy and they added dishes we didn't even have; the manager literally got up in my uncle's face yelling at him and his wife and made her cry by telling them that they're going to call the police. That is not how you treat a customer.  We are never going back because of how we were treated. Overall: the food gets a 3/5 and customer service gets -2/5. I hope they don't treat other customers like that."}
{"text":"Whenever my friend and I are in the mood for dim sum, we come here for their discounted dim sum times (9am-11am, 2pm-4pm). The food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. We got pork spare ribs, har gow, shu mai, crab claws, beef balls, tripe, and rice noodle rolls with shrimp. Everything was so good and only came to about $15/person which is great. I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"I LOVE dim sum, and this place does it RIGHT. The dishes are consistently good. The only problem might be in dealing with the servers that don't speak English. If you look asian and can't speak Cantonese or Mandarin, they look at you like you are from another planet. But you come for the food and that is the most important. This is old school Chinese food at it's best.

It's always busy, so if you like a quiet intimate setting then this is not for you."}
