{"text":"I had the penne, it was a little hard but ok! Wasn't impressed. I guess people come for drinks only! Nothing great about the food."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a sunny saturday for an early diner.  We were warmly greeted and seated on the patio.  Service was prompt and polite.  We were pleasantly surprised by the food; good salad, solid pasta, nice veal.  A worthwhile stop if you are exploring little Italy in Toronto and looking for a quick meal on a sunny saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group of ladies for a girl's night out. The staff was attentive and fun. Our food came out quite quickly considering it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was packed. The food itself was so good. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We had the seafood linguini with marinara sauce and chicken pesto pizza.  Both were pretty good considering we had been walking and sightseeing all day so we were starving.  The chicken pesto pizza was a nice thin crust pizza but I really enjoyed the linguini since they had a nice mix of shrimp, scallops, and calamari."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here on a hot summer day. We wanted to eat inside, but found out that it wouldn't be cooler in there because the doors and windows were open. So we sat in the shade on the patio. I ordered the garlic pizza and it was to die for. One of the best pizza's I've had. I could have eaten the whole thing myself, but stopped myself because I knew in 10 minutes I would regret it.  My mom ordered a pasta dish, but couldn't get further than a few bites because she wasn't feeling the great. The server was so sweet and was trying to help my mom. She brought her some ginger ale and kept coming over to see if everything was ok.   I keep meaning to go back here, and now that I'm writing this, I'm craving the pizza so bad!"}
{"text":"Our experience was pretty good. They served bread and oil & hot oil when we sat down. My date & I ordered the salad & calamari pictured. Calamari was ok.. I've had better. And the salad was good, I don't eat with much salt so it was perfect for me but it may be bland for others. The fettuccini Alfredo was amaaaazing! My date ordered a Diavalo pizza which was delicious tasting but pretty soggy in the centre. Staff was great. Drinks weren't free refills which kinda sucks but overall I had a good experience."}
{"text":"It's just ok. Better than the family style restaurants, but not worthy of any more stars from me."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 20 for a birthday.  Food did not sit well with most of us.  Service is mediocre. Food smells better than it tastes. Would not return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick pizza and didn't realize that it was going to be one of the yummiest thin crust pizzas I've ever had! I'm usually a \"one slice\" kinda girl, but I almost ate half of it myself.  I tried the Margherita and can't wait to try the other ones!  Would definitely recommend The Standard!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  Split two pastas and I'm already planning on coming back to enjoy more of their delicious food.  You can always tell a lot about a place by their washrooms and the standard's met my standard!  Gorgeous! Love this place try it out for sure."}
{"text":"Love the Mimo salad... Great servers, awesome patio, right on College St."}
{"text":"Friday night at The Standard - not bad actually. I like dining at places that are full of people eating, drinking and having a good time. Full house = good food, right?  Not exactly.   I don't think its the food that draws people into The Standard - I've had way better Italian elsewhere. It's likely the low price - you get a lot of food for less than you'd pay in other places, but you sacrifice on the quality.  I was very disappointed with the polenta calamari - while the appetizer portion was very generous and more than enough for 3 of us to share, it was bland, dry and chewy. No amount of lemon or tomato sauce on the side could hide that fact.   We also had the raddicchio-pear-walnut-goat cheese salad, which I'll admit was fresh and flavourful. The pizzas (\"The Standard\" and that night's special of  mozzarella and mushrooms on whole wheat crust) were a touch oily, but they got a passing grade from me.  My friends and I left happy, probably more due to the amount of wine we consumed than anything else."}
{"text":"Third time not lucky. Waitress failed to bring bread plus oil & balsamic. Three tables around us had the bread. Why not us?    We were a group four, not 10 thus easy to monitor. We requested 4 pasta dishes. One was totally incorrect. Three of us had left overs. She politely said they would be wrapped up to take away. Once we arrived home the leftovers we received were not our meal. So terrible!!  Not once were we offered water. We had to ask. Seems like some people at the Standard are totally neglected.   My wife and I were excited to take dear friends to this lovely Little Italy restaurant. It was an embarrassment to us and our friends.    I was hoping this would become the spot for my staff. Apparently it's not a place to have 144 employees get disappointed. There are far too many great restaurants on College to pass up. But in this case take a pass on the Standard."}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty, probably would have tasted a million times better if the terrible service didn't leave such a bad taste in our mouths. From the moment we were \"greeted\" by the hostess until after we paid our bill (and we still tipped 20%), we were treated like a couple of bums who were trying to eat at some upscale, fancy restaurant. They have pizza on the menu, not caviar. They shouldn't treat customers so poorly because the place does have a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Two words - food poisoning.   Bathrooms were philthy, drinks came in spotted plastic cups and the caprese salad was completely tasteless. Despite the bad food and the subsequent digestive issues the servers tried their best. Both the hostess and the waiter were the only reason I didn't get up and walk out.   Will never be back."}
{"text":"The Standard is aptly named, it's pretty much just that. The food is generally well portioned and the prices are okay but like the other comments suggest, the service is not amazing. You don't get bread and you have to ask for water and refills.  If you call for takeout sometimes an older lady with a raspy voice answers, then without replying to you she passes the phone to a server. Just not a polite etiquette at all!  I think they need to get their management in order because their \"servers wanted\" sign has been up for 8 months. There is a reason that, in a city with this many people, they can't keep staff around..."}
{"text":"Went for a friends birthday. The service was great despite what other yelp reviewers have said.  Restaurant was full. We sat upstairs - also packed. I had the arugula salad which was huge and really enough for a meal or to share. Pizza of the day which was good and I really liked the crust. Everyone in the party really enjoyed the food and the restaurant being packed during a snowstorm is a good sign I think. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Shitty service. Most of the food was poor quality. The server hated his job and had an attitude problem. Will never go back. I'm not sure how this server got a job there, was condescending and was hard to even get drinks ordered. The place looks great but because the service was terrible it ruined everything. My pizza was ok however my friends who ordered pasta said that there was no flavor. The lobster was overcooked in one of the dishes, grilled calamari was salty. Fried calamari was ok but nothing special.  Dont eat here, lots of other places on College that can offer better service and food."}
{"text":"Great traditional pizza is served here. We had an excellent perfectly seasoned ceaser salad and pizza nevebianca. Very flavorful and light. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I do agree with the other reviewers that the service is not stellar here.  But the food and prices are reasonably good.  I am surprised to find so many people criticizing the food.  It is not microwaved pasta - no it's not hand-made pasta - if you are looking for that you do need to pay more than what the Standard is charging.  However it's reasonably good fare.  We ordered the seafood salad, mussels, Caesar salad, veal parmesan and linguine seafood and everyone enjoyed what they ate.  They do serve bread with their meals (it's not true that they don't serve it as I have read others state here) as I have been offered bread every time I've eaten there.  I think the fault likely lies with the servers for those who didn't receive any with their meal.  We do tend to visit when they are not busy and the service tends to be better."}
{"text":"The Standard Pizza and Pasta Bar  The name clearly explains what they serve, and a few more.  I decided to eat at this place only because I found Lasagna at the top their Pasta list. This is a local restaurant where you can find some classic italian dishes available at Toronto's Little Italy, at the south-west corner of College and Beatrice Streets.    At first, I was a little wary of the type of lasagna they were going to serve. It's one dish that I  had at some places, drowned in herb lacking and/or with a out-of-a-can taste tomato sauce. However, this place surprised me with the Bolognese style meat sauce, in which I didn't feel cheated at all with the generously portioned meat combined with the mozzarella and pasta. I found myself scraping the meat sauce from the plate. Lasagna is decently priced at $12.   The portion was filling and I struggled to finish the last few bites. I could have skipped eating the complimentary bread and an order of Antipasti(appetizers)--Cozze (Mussels in Tomato Garlic Sauce for $9). I have no regrets in ordering the mussels. It was just as tasty too.     Service was very good. The waiter was friendly and the busboy was quick at clearing the empty plates between courses. The food was served hot and in good time.   As for Ambiance, a combination of contemporary lounge jazz and a little Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin sets the mood(with reasonable volume level) for  the contemporary look of the restaurant. The place is nicely lit, just enough ambient lighting for the customers to be able to read the menu."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here a few times and it seems that food quality gets worse with each visit. Yesterday was definitely my last.  The sangria I ordered was made from wine made out of someone's garage. Poor garbage. Should be ashamed of yourself for serving this crap. The pizza was not cooked. The crust was raw. The calamari were recooked and nuked in the microwave. The service was slow. No bread was served or water. With service like this, it won't take long for people to stop dining here. If I could give no stars, I would."}
{"text":"Great fresh made pizza with an awesome patio.  The staff are great and very family friendly.  We often have The Canadian Pizza but everything we'd tried has been great."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a few weeks ago on a business trip...  Service was absolutely terrible and there was only one other table with guests.  The food was microwaved frozen pasta that tasted like cardboard. If my Nonna were still alive she would've smacked the crap out of the \"chef\".  This is as about as fake of an Italian joint as it gets."}
{"text":"It was a last-minute decision to have dinner with friends two weekends ago, that brought me out to The Standard and their patio, in the heart of Little Italy.  The atmosphere was good, and it was a mixed clientele - everyone from families to groups of friends, to dudes that could pass for extras for the next season of Jersey Shore.   I wasn't expecting - or looking for - anything super-fancy, so I was happy to order one of the many pizzas they serve. I took on the salty Napolitana (with anchovies). I was worried I would get an enormous plate I couldn't finish. But I thought the portion and sizing was just right. Tasty, too. And at $11, it doesn't break the bank.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the service. Let's face it - when you're sitting on a decently-sized patio that's bustling on a Saturday night, you're hoping for half-decent. Our waiter was not only great - and relatively prompt with our orders - he was super-nice and had a sense of humour. Even when we were waiting for our bills, he had the decency to let us know the delay was because of a faulty debit/credit card machine and he was waiting for the one that worked.  All in all, for my first time here, I thought it was a good showing."}
{"text":"My hubby and I and 2 other couples set out for a night of drinking and eating in Little Italy. We really didn't have a plan of where to go and I wish I would have researched it more. We decided on this restaurant because it was busy, the food smelled good and they could get 6 of in after a short wait.  The service at the bar getting a pre-dinner drinks was extremely slow, not sure how long one much stand in front of the bartender before being asked what I want to drink. We are fairly quick service to place our orders for appetizers and dinner, but then sat and waited and waited for our food to come out. Our server didn't come around at all to refresh our drinks. Many at the table ordered salad with our entrees and they came out all together. Not only is that annoying to have your salad next to your entree crowding the table, but I figured that is restaurant 101 to serve appetizers first, followed by salad, then entrees.  I ordered a caesar salad and the seafood risotto special. The caesar salad was wilting and tasted like it had been tossed in the dressing and left to sit for an hour before getting to our table. I was really excited about the risotto, but it lacked any flavor.  I'm not sure why this place was so packed."}
{"text":"Got the carbonara because I'm very picky about my pastas so I figured go with the one no one can mess up.  They messed up.  Runny and bland.   No flavour what so ever and this is a dish that has pancetta.  How can pancetta not be flavourful?  There pizza may deserve a 3 as my friend said it was not bad....now that's a ringing endorsement.   Servers and patio are nice!"}
{"text":"This place was awful and the service nonexistent. I don't know why it got good reviews. Also the waiter seemed personally offended that we had brought our two young kids with us - even though it was early in the evening - and relegated us to Siberia. It seemed like he'd never seen customers come in with a kid before."}
{"text":"We were walking around Toronto for about 4 hours, just taking in the city and being a tourist... when my feet started to ache and his stomach started to grumble. When we stopped at the intersection to see what was around us, we saw Standard.  It was holiday Monday so at first there was worry that a lot of venues would be closed. However as we walked up to the doors to peer in, a happy man with an Italian accent opened the door and said \"Please come in, don't be shy\" so, we did!  The restaurant doesn't look too special and was playing top 40 hits... I was uncertain what to expect, I ordered a glass of white wine and perused the menu.   We decided on sharing the arancini and the ravioli for our quick nosh. When the arancini came out I was shocked at how big they were, you definitely had to eat them in portions, but were those balls ever stuffed with cheese! The side of marinara to dip in was tasty too.  The ravioli tasted fresh and was a decent size portion with A LOT of rose sauce. I even made the comment of... \"Oh wow its saucy\" haha   Cute little place with good food, wish I was more hungry at the time to try more dishes."}
{"text":"The food is Delicious. The Pizza and Pasta melts in your mouth. This is my favourite restaurant on college street. A wonderful place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple pizza's and the pizza itself was alright, nothing too complicated or overly fancy that stuck out at me and in terms of flavour it didn't wow me so much, but it was filling and for the size, worth the price."}
{"text":"We visited The Standard today during the Taste of Italy.  They extended the patio and offered only a small special menu due to the anticipated crowds.  We were there Sunday around 3pm and it was about 1/2 full.  Service was Ok, but it did take a while to place our order.  The calamari fitti  was excellent, but the portion size was very small.  We saw other tables order it and sizes varied widely.  We also ordered a pizza (only 4 on the special menu and when we asked to substitute they refused) while indrediants were fresh the pizza was not properly cooked.  Crust was soggy.    Also order a couple of beers.  Daughter Mill Street listed on the menu as $8 but on the bill was $8.25  No bread was offered for the table.  All in all a very mediocre place.  So many itialian options on this street like diplomatico that it is  unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"A solid 3 stars is how I feel.  I came here with about 6 people and I found the food was good but overall forgettable.  It was very average.  The servers were extremely nice and there were lots of spaces for seating on the patio.  It is also across the street from a large parking lot, if you drive.  We had pizza and it was pretty good.  BUT, someone in my group had the gnocchi and it was amazing.  I'll probably come here again at some point but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"I went to Standard Pizza for a meetup event.  They had a drinks special and lots of us ordered mixed drinks.  They were really watered down and didn't taste great at all.  I really hope they aren't as watered down at normal prices.  The food was ok, nothing great.  The pizza I ordered didn't have much toppings on it.  The service was reasonable given we were a big group.  There are a lot of good restaurants in Little Italy and I don't think I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and like most reviews I can agree that the service isn't anything to be blown away by but the lychee royale and pizza will make up for that."}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta restaurant in Little Italy. I came here last night for a farewell dinner for one of our colleague. The servers were really great in accommodating such a big group of people. One server for our table was kind enough to offer in the beginning that he can split the bills for us, even if it meant doing that manually.   He was also the one that recommended the Blue Hawaiian cocktail - $8 for me, which I really enjoyed. I also ordered the ravioli - $15 and it came in a huge portion. The ravioli were served in rose sauce, but I wish there was a little bit more sauce. Otherwise, it was delicious and quite filling, I couldn't finish it in the end. Overall, the bill came to about $31 which already included gratuity. A bit steep imo. But whatever it's fine, our server was awesome and it was with good company."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up! True Italian dishes and thin crust pizza served here. Just like Italia!!  The Irish waiter who served us was very attentive. We will be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Great pasta and salad, my favorite was the penne pollo and Caesar salad. Servers are friendly and helpful. Usually not too busy during the week"}
{"text":"Decided to com to College street on a Saturday with no dinner reservations big mistake. This place was the only place without a wait. I should've taken this as a sign but I didn't because I was hungry and when I'm hungry I stop thinking clearly. College is full of Italian restaurants and Regines is my personal favourite it has huge delicious portions and it's cheap. The standard on the on the other hand has none of those things. The portions weren't huge nor were they delicious.  I ordered the meat lovers personal Pizza and it wasn't much of a meat lovers pizza normally meat lovers pizzas have pepperoni, bacon and sausage. This one seemed to only have pepperoni and salami how disappointing. The pizza it self didn't have a lot of flavour in the sauce or anything. One plus side is the crust was great it was thin and the toppings went right the the edge of the crust.  I personally would not recommend this place and I definitely will not be back especially with the great Reginas not too far away."}
{"text":"This place was a place we settled on going to and maybe a poor choice at that.   The food here is not bad, it's definitely overpriced though for the quality. Its all your standard Italian pastas and pizzas. Its nothing you can't get anywhere else in Little Italy.   Don't bother drinking here either unless you're willing to spend a lot of money on your drinks. After seeing the drink prices we opted not to get alcoholic beverages, and from that point on we got terrible service. Our server was pretty absent. And our food took forever!   This is not the first place I have experienced poor service when I have opted not to drink. I realize the bill is more and the serving staff makes more tips, but I don't think I should have to drink when I go out just to get good service.   Also, this place has two levels, but be careful if you're seated upstairs because the stairs are VERY steep and very dangerous. The lighting leading up is pretty poor as well. I don't know how they carry the plates up there.  Overall not impressed with this place and I will not likely come back to this standard restaurant."}
{"text":"Forgettable. And yet the thing I will take away from this place is how easy the atmoshere was, with a mix of professionals and guidos alike.  My pasta arrived cold, and while my date wanted to send it back, I didnt have the heart.I dont think I would have cared for it, warm or not.  He got the grilled chicken with cracked black pepper and vegetables, and I could actually stomach it. Our antipasto was average. Overall, I ate more bread and butter than anything.  Also, they ahve upstairs seating and we asked out waitress about it when we first arrived, and she looked at him like he asked if she knew how to get to Narnia or something, and said shed never been upstairs, she had no idea what he was talking about. Ten minutes later, a group walks in an is seated upstairs.   Perfect if your in the area and looking for something to munch on and not big on conversation since seatings cramped and its insanely loud ( guido alert), not for those with standards."}
{"text":"Great service, pleasant atmosphere, prime location! The calamari is exceptional and the pizza was also very good! Perfect patio for enjoying the games, especially fun during futbol season."}
{"text":"This place is suitably named.  Decent spot for grabbing some drinks on a patio, but you'll find dozens of similar places nearby and there is nothing particularly distinctive about the Standard that would make me chose it over other options.  Food is pretty \"standard\" too, moderately priced pasta and pizzas.  I've been a few times for drinks, service was always good (but not great)"}
{"text":"Excellent, small and nice. Service and food was A1. Definitely going to be a regular. Near parking lot"}
{"text":"I stopped here unplanned for a late lunch with friends last weekend. The menu seemed very standard for an Italian restaurant - and perhaps a bit boring. Nothing really appealed to me that much, but I split a caesar salad and prosciutto pizza with one friend. Neither really wowed me and the pizza was only lukewarm when it was brought out to us. The service was friendly though and their patio was a nice place to spend a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the street patio. Otherwise the service was average, the beer was flat, the pasta I ordered was bland and watery, and it was overpriced for what you get. Great place for drinks on a patio but that's it."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss for me but as of the last couple of times it was good (hence why I returned).  The calamari, calzone and pizza are actually delicious. The last time I went was on Friday night and the atmosphere is great-usually is in Toronto on college street. The Patio was packed but we only waited 5 minutes to get seated (2 of us).  My friend and I decided to go for drinks and share some food. She got the white sangria (1/2 litre as they don't sell by the glass which is pretty much the standard across the board). We had a horrible experience with their red sangria (do not recommend at all). I tasted her sangria and we both agreed that it was delicious! Lots of fruit, a hint of orange, great mix.  I got two glasses of the cab sauv- pretty good selection of wine.  We split the fried calamari (always delicious and they have an even more delicious white sauce to pair) amazing, always a hit.  We then decided to share quattro Stagioni pizza. It has Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella Cheese, Mushrooms, Sundried Tomatoes, Ham & Artichokes. I personally do not eat ham so I removed it (my friend loves it so to be fair I went with this selection).  We literally scarfed down the pizza- DELICIOUS and perfectly baked.  Service was good, nothing above and beyond but he was attentive and fast. Food arrived at a reasonable time too.  Overall, I will return to standard again. It's a decent choice for a night out!"}
{"text":"Lovely neighborhood and cute little patio on a nice sunny day!!   We had the grilled octopus, seafood linguine and the Mima's pizza (pesto chicken with sun-dried tomatoes). Everything was tasty. We weren't wowed, but it was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places where a waiter immediately understands what are you asking for, when you mention that the pizza is lacking oregano.  Which is good.  All the rest is... Well, ok at best. Not really bad, just mediocre, as mentioned by one of the reviewers - and that is an exact word. If you just pass by and think whether the place is safe to get in - for sure you can, no problem. If you are looking for an impressive food experience - no need to try, you will not be impressed."}
