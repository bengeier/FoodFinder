{"text":"Can't say too much good things about this place.  Food is okay, service is poor.  I only came here because I find out that the place next to it closed down.  If you're dying for a quick meal and everywhere else is packed, you should probably go to mcdonalds instead."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. The food here is great. It's cheap, but good. They do get quite busy during lunch time, but it's only because that the restaurant is very good! :) It's definitely worth the wait. Food is delivered quickly. It's like a fast-food Chinese restaurant pretty much. I've been here a couple times and plan to be a regular!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the lunch specials for Jubilee Cafe.

I have to tell you, this place is busy for lunch! I was there at around 2 pm.. and every single table was occupied! 

Daily lunch specials starting from $4.99 that includes a choice of Chinese/Western soup and a hot drink.

I decide on the Chinese soup and the beef brisket stired fried rice noodle ($5.99). The Chinese soup tasted really home made, not laced with MSG. The size of the noodle was perfect for me and it was nicely presented with veggies. The beef brisket were tender and tasty... Yes I finished the whole thing! :)

BTW, even if you order from the regular menu, all the dishes comes with a free hot drink!

I will be definitely be back for lunch again! :)"}
