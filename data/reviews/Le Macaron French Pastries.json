{"text":"Cute shop, very friendly staff/owner.  Delicious fancy chocolates, yummy macarons!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for fancy chocolate or macarons.  They even have cute little boxes to put your chocolates/macarons in if you're giving them as gifts."}
{"text":"I love macarons and it is sad to say that this was a Bad experience, the macarons were old and overpriced."}
{"text":"Excellent service, nice atmosphere and they have a huge selection of macaron flavors to choose from. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I noticed Le Macaron as I was about to go into Sorso Wine Bar, and could not resist. They offer gelato, chocolate candies (NOT truffles) and macarons. The candies are gorgeous little jewels, hard chocolate shells with amazing swirls of color and a ganache-like filling. The macarons are true French macarons, delicate and flaky in a ton of flavors. Everything I tried was delicious and the service was perfect. The shop is pretty and clean. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We have come here for over a year now and love it! The violet and mint gelato is our favorite."}
{"text":"The macarons did not live up to their French name and I found them to be a little pricey.  But the shop is cute, the service was friendly, and let's face it...even a 3-star macaron is a nice way to treat yourself.  I'd stop by again if I was in the area, but wouldn't recommend making a trip for it specifically."}
{"text":"The pastries, latte, macarons and gelato is all heavenly!  The service is impeccable and the place is the hip and chic! Oh la la!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place with delicious macaron and ice cream  Haven't tasted the chocolate yet but will definitely be back for it  Owner is extremely nice and friendly  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Le Macaron went out of their way to deliver our order, we live out of state and they were so accommodating to us. Prompt delivery and perfect presentation. Our clients were blown away! Five stars!"}
{"text":"Note to owner, if you see few customers walks in, try to ask who walks in first and service them instead if picking who you like to serve.  We were waiting for about 3 minutes and another customer walks in, the owner walks out which seems like he was in the back room watching a monitor to see who he wants to serve.  Then he was taking his sweet time serving this lady and did not even bother acknowledging us.  We walked out.  We are regular customers we frequent this place, and we never had any issue, strangely enough we normally don't deal with the owner.  Don't think we will ever coming back."}
{"text":"I love Le Macaron! This place is my go to afternoon pick me up! I love to pop in on my lunch break for their delicious iced coffee, I work just around the corner so the fact that it's super convenient doesn't hurt either.   My coworkers and I also love to treat each other to the yummy truffles and macaroons, but I think my favorite treat is the warm almond croissant, it literally melts in your mouth. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow!  The pastries are heavenly, the coffee is great,  the chocolates are exquisite, the gelato is wonderful, and the service is phenomenal!  You gotta go here.  :- ).  In the heart of the Scottsdale Quarter, an intriguing offering unique to this area.    I never had a macaron before, and really enjoyed the crunchy outside complimented by the truffle like center.  I tried the rose macaron first, then followed it up with Madagascar Black Vanilla.  This second one hooked me!  It was nothing short of exquisite, with flavor that really grew as the center melted in my mouth.  Go there soon while the lines are short!"}
{"text":"The pastries are very good. The gelato looks great. The only problem is the Scottsdale matrons who can't seem to make up their minds. Be prepared to wait patiently, it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Yelp said it was open until 10 pm but no it was closed at 9pm very disappointing ..especially when we drove around to find this place please update  your hours on yelp"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite spot in Scottsdale for dessert! They have French gelato which is to die for....especially the chocolate! Both the nutella and cinnabon crepes are out of this world!! They also have gourmet chocolates and gluten free macaroons which I'll definitely be trying next time I go.  Staff is super friendly and the decor beyond charming. I highly recommend Le macaron!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I had the crepes with cinnamon, butter and sugar and it was DELICIOUS!! I have had many many crepes and this is definitely at the top of the list! I also had a vanilla macaron and it w was amazing! Highly highly recommend making a trip here. Also, its so nice that its in the Scottsdale quarter which is a beautiful place to walk around."}
{"text":"Yum yum in my tum tum! I came here mid-afternoon needing a sweet pick-me-up, and boy did they deliver. Not only did they have varieties upon varieties of macarons, but they had gelato and espresso drinks. Score!  I ended up being a little bit of a brat and sampled the macarons they had out for tasting, and then ordered a small scoop of gelato. That way I was able to have both - woo hoo! Like I said, little bit of a brat move, but my pregnant cravings couldn't help themselves.  Oh, try the violet gelato! It was very different, but really good!"}
{"text":"Smells so good in here!!! Cute decor with fuschia colored walls & french style lounge chairs. Wide selection of macarons and gelato and they also serve about 10 different flavored crepes."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I tried an affogato, which is espresso and gelato. I never heard of it before, but I got it with coconut gelato. The combination of the hot espresso with the cold gelato was amazing! I left there knowing I had to have more. Their iced coffee is to die for with gelato, not to mention their variety of macarons. This is definitely one of my favorite places to visit at the Quarter!"}
{"text":"The Gelato is very creamy and tasty.. Everything is fresh and delicious....The owner is a class act.  I left my wallet and a small bag on the counter by accident, He safely placed it away for me to return to get it, He even tried to call me..  Friendly and classy.. Come visit..."}
{"text":"A fantastic location, even better French gelato from Toulouse!!   The Arabica coffee, Creme Brûlée and Violet gelato are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Tried this cute little place for some Macarons. They were so fresh and delicious! I would highly recommend going here for your dessert needs. They have gelato and crepes that I would love to try since the macarons are amazing. Must try!"}
{"text":"I love macarons, but they are definitely not all created equally.  This little shop in Scottsdale Quarters fits the bill.  They offer interesting flavors such as cassis, earl grey, and rose, as well as more traditional flavors like chocolate, vanilla, coffee, etc.  I personally really like the cassis ones.   Besides the macarons, I would also recommend trying the violet flavored gelato.  It sounds strange, but it is really tasty."}
{"text":"A little piece of France in Scottsdale. Friendly service. Great desserts. Cute atmosphere. I had gelato in Italy and this is a good comparison!"}
{"text":"This place takes the cake......no really, it's fantastic. This is the best Macaron I have ever had. So light and delicate with just the right amount of chewiness. Axel the owner is delightful and enthusiastically offered samples of two of his best sellers, Chocolate which was sooo good and the Lavender which was even better. Then he moved us onto the \"imported from France\" Gelato.... O.M.G it was exquisite. I tried 3 favors and settled on the Arabic Coffee and the Violet, yes like the flower....such an amazing delicate flavor. This place will definitely become a regular for me. I can't wait to go back and try the coffee and fresh baked croissants."}
{"text":"Cute litte macaron and gelato place. On this visit I didn't purchase any macarons or the little jewel looking candies, only gelato. Everything looked amazing and was reasonably priced.  My kids each got a small gelato - my oldest had the coffee flavor and my youngest has half chocolate, half mint chocolate chip. The coffee had a great, strong coffee flavor - not the toned down, sugar flavor that a lot of regular ice creams have.  As we sat I saw a sign for an affogato - a scoop of gelato with a shot of espresso poured on top. I had one with the chocolate gelato...I'm still thinking about it. It was delicious.  The shop is shop and my kids thought it was cute. Not my particular favorite decorating scheme but a lot of people love it. Very clean.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I come here anytime I'm in the area. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've had the macaroons, the gelato, and the chocolates... all amazing! I'm always greated by a friendly smile and a helpful recommendation when I can't make up my mind. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Foods good, the lady was kind of rude to me tho, probably because I don't wear a business suit and have nappy hair. I'm here to spend money and I definitely felt mistreated. I'll try to get my macron elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I love this place! The macaroons are incredible and the gelato is amazing! Definitely don't miss this place if you're in Scottsdale! They also have the best iced coffee float around!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after dinner and the macarons were fantastic. I ordered a variety and they were all pretty good, but the rose was my favorite. I'm not from this area but I found them to be reasonably priced compared to macarons in other places.  Also the store is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and we loved it, it's a small cute shop with great service and delicious crepes. The s'mores crepe was so chocolatey and warm . The banana foster crepe is not on the menu but they made it for my hubby and it was amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down the best macaroon place in AZ. They have so many interesting and wonderful flavors to Choose from. The caramel, vanilla bean and the raspberry are all favorites of mine.  It can be challenging to find parking in front because of all the retail shopping. So you may have to park in the garage.  The place is a little pricey but totally worth it. Every time I bring and office macaroons from here.:.. they love it! Can't wait to go back next time I am in town s try some different flavors. I've seen keylime Pie.... definitely on my bucket list!"}
{"text":"Delicious! First time trying these. The flavors are amazing. I like pistachio coconut lavender and rose. A little pricey but well worth it"}
{"text":"I don`t know why people criticize this wonderful, amazing place! You have to try the ice-cream macaroon! It comes in a  cute little box and the taste gets better and better!"}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of typical French macaron flavors and taste exactly like they do in France! If I lived nearby I'd go back every weekend"}
{"text":"Delicious little bit of goodness, and not to mention violet gelato!! This is my go to for a little something sweet."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe! We were curious to try and glad we did because it's the best macarons I've ever had. It's pricey but so worth it. Guys, it is also gluten free! This is great for presents as some of my friends have sensitivity to gluten."}
{"text":"Of course I had to go inside and try their goodies.  I have actually gone in there more than once.  Last time I was there, they had violet gelato,  I love weird flavors.  Their macarons are good, but I prefer the ones from another place, but if I am in this part of town I am not going to deny my sweet tooth.  Their chocolates are also very tasty.  My husband said that the coffee gelato has the best coffee flavor he has had anywhere in town.  I have to take his word for it, since I don't do cold coffee in any form.  The place is very nice, and spacious."}
{"text":"Just say yes to this place. It's in the Scottsdale Quarters and is a perfect post-dinner spot to grab a coffee, a macaron (or 20) or a homemade chocolate. The chocolate truffles here are so good and come in flavors like Prosecco! They also have chocolate Eiffel Towers. Yes Eiffel Towers! Yes! Or should I say \"Oui Oui\"! Or \"Mais Oui\"!  Ok but seriously come here. I love their Macarons. They are fantastic. I love their chocolates. While I do not live in Scottsdale when I am in town and visiting the Quarters I figure out a reason to pop into here. The store owner is usually working there too and he is lovely."}
{"text":"Best coffee gelato around!! Haven't had this good gelato since Italy!! Must have! Owner is extremely nice and always welcoming."}
{"text":"The last thing I need is a Macaron...so I settled for a half dozen! Yes, while waiting for my fabulous treatment at Skin Laundry, up at The Scottsdale Quarter, I noticed Le Macaron's business cards on the side table so decided there and then I would pick up a few after a bit of 'lunch and shopping' --- very Patsy & Eddy! I love all these little babies but my faves include: Passion Fruit Dark Chocolate, Belgian Chocolate and Colombian Coffee. I guess I'll have to spin my way on the bike for a few more minutes...or run on the TM for at least 30 more seconds. Either way...I refuse to feel guilty for allowing this new 'sweet addiction' into my Life. Give 'em a try. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Beautiful shop...like taking a step back into a French patisserie!   I tried the black currant and lavendar white chocolate macarons - so tasty.  So many of the flavors looked tempting and I'm sure I'll be back to try some others."}
{"text":"The macarons are so incredibly beautiful and equally delicious. Also tried the dark chocolate Eiffel tower that was almost too pretty to eat. The place itself is also very clean and chic. I believe the owner is the one that helped us which made the experience even better considering how kind and friendly she was. Even followed us across the street when I forgot my purse in the store. Will definitely be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"I have yet to try their gelato or chocolates, but their macaroons are one of the best desserts to ever touch these lips.  They aren't inexpensive, but they are worth every penny.  The amount of time and care they put into the baking, display, and packaging of these handmade sugar gems is extraordinary.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Not great. My 5YO daughter is a macaron connoisseur, and she did not approve!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice... and first time got a box of 8 macarons and second time got a box 6 macarons and 1 ice cream macaron. As much as I truly want to love this place, I just can't. The environment the workers create doesn't have a very friendly vibe and the macarons are really not that great. The ice cream one was actually worth trying at least one more time, but I won't be getting the regular macarons again. Some are hollow, most are dry, fall apart and make a mess, maybe taste a little stale... I thought it was the only place in town that had them, but after hearing about elsewhere I unfortunately will be switching. Or honestly learning to make them at home! These are too expensive to have such a high rate of being disappointing. :("}
{"text":"Gelato.  Need I say more.  hmmmm.  Chocolate croissant, nice and crunchy.  Need I say more.  Lastly, macarons!!  Super yummy, gluten free, great variety to choose from, pistachio was my favorite!  Great offerings if you need a presentable gift to someone special.  I didn't try the chocolates but they looked delectable.  Good reason for me to go back again, been here twice already!  Nice store ambiance."}
{"text":"We had the best experience and lesson on macarons! We were kindly greeted by Howard. He told us his favorites and the most popular ones to choose from. Howard even gave us a brief history of the company.  Everything was tasty. My favorites we're pistachio, coconut, chocolate, and Colombian coffee. All macarons were delicious! Friendly, clean, and beautiful treats to choose from."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place with a fun atmosphere.  The products are just spectactular.  Expensive, but delicious and perfectly made.  Service is always super friendly."}
{"text":"Yes, it's somewhat expensive, but worth a splurge for sure. The macarons are kept chilled, and the knowledgeable owner advised correctly to let them come up to temperature just a bit before eating. They have a nice variety of flavors, making orchard to decide. We went with a half dozen: lavender Earl Grey tea, pistachio, coffee, passion fruit with dark chocolate, and rose. All were equally delicious. My favorite may have been rose, light and delicate but definitely possessing the essence of rose.   The gelato was of high quality as well, and we enjoyed a generous small cup with two flavors: violet and creme brulee. I love all of the herb and flower inspired choices. The decor is cute and comfortable, with seating both indoor and outside. It's a nice place to relax and people watch. We'd surely return (too often) if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"Le Macaron has delicious sweets, macarons, gelato, beautiful chocolates. They added sweet crepes which are our new first choice to get for desserts. Now they have also added savory crepes, and also now open from breakfast time on. The new crepes are done well, beautiful, also delicious. Huge and filling, but always save room for the sweet crepes after! Axel, Howard and all the rest of the staff are very personable and invested in the customers enjoying their food. They remodeled and now there are plenty of seats for all, in an already beautiful location. This is our favorite evening time meeting place to hang out and get food and dessert."}
{"text":"Nice store, big selection, however, the macarons were just okay."}
{"text":"Howard makes one mean Peach cobbler crepe! I had it with a scoop of apricot gelato. DELICIOUS! Everyone here is very friendly! I will be back every time I visit Scottsdale!!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in and were given a pleasant greeting by the shop owner, who was very kind and explained everything about what they offer from macarons to gelato to truffles. This is a fantastic stop for anyone who wants to eat gluten free treats! They also have some dairy free macaron options. I've had many macarons and these are by far the best I've ever tasted. The texture is perfect and the flavours are beautiful and delicate. The price was just right for these absolutely perfect confections, as we bought a box of 6 for $15. Many places will charge about $2 each but they won't be nearly as good, in my experience. This place charges a bit more but they are so totally worth it. And the more you buy, the better the value. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My infatuation with macarons brought me into this cute french pastrie shop. I ordered 6 different flavors, strawberry, coffee, lavender, ginger, pistachio, and rose. I have had many macarons from many different places and these were okay not the worst but not the best I've ever had. Now the environment, store front, and uniqueness is well worth the trip in, I didn't try any of their chocolates but WOW they looked simply exquisite in the case! Service was friendly and knowledgeable too. The flavors in the creame were not satisfying and there was more cookie (shell) then filling and the filling, which as I understand is where the flavor comes from, is what makes the whole treat divine! But the texture was spot on not too crunchy not to soft. Would not buy macarons here again, the lavender was like soap over the top in scent and the strawberry was more jelly like in flavor than creame. I'm forever spoiled by Aunt Abby's confections their macarons are perfect in every way! I'll be back for some chocolates and coffee tho."}
{"text":"My wife and I just returned from a trip to Paris and were lamenting on how we missed French food. Finding this little gem certainly help give us our French fix! Excellent drinks and pastries that are comparable with those you'd find on the streets of Paris. We will likely be back many times!"}
{"text":"Ok...i wanted to let you know about the actual macarons.  We bought some home after we had their gelato.  I had mine the following day so hence the reason for this update...there are no words....these macarons are the BEST sweet treats!!!  The Belgian chocolate, Madagascar vanilla and the coffee ones are what we had and they were fabulous!!  We live in Arcadia but we WILL drive to Scottsdale Quarter just to share one between the 3 of us!!!!  Ok thats a little ridiculous but you get my point.  Listen when you visit The Q, this is a must have!  Can't wait until I try the Affogatto next time.  Great job Le Macaron!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while walking around Scottsdale quarter while my nephew and grandma were in town. My nephew has never had a macaroon and he's pretty picky. He loved it!  I had the coffee one and it was very good. I also had a double espresso which was very good. The owner is very friendly and took time to talk to us and answer our questions. I will definitely go back!  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Adorable little creperie. Had the cinnamon  bun crepe with salted caramel gelato. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic dessert place to stop by if your in the area. We go there for the gelato. It's some of the best gelato I've had. So smooth and flavorful. They have some flavors that are usually always available and they cycle others, so it's a little bit of a nice surprise each time you go in.   The service is excellent. Each time we've been we've been greeted warmly and helped promptly. They will even give you great advice on which gelato flavors go best together and why those particular flavors work with each other.  They have many other desserts to choose from so you'll have to visit many different times!"}
{"text":"Three stars because their macaroons were quite the blehhh.  Boyfriend and I tried a pistachio one and a lavender white chocolate one.  Unless you like very sweet things, I would recommend not getting anything with their white chocolate filling.  It was too much.  My macaroon fell apart completely and a lot of it got left on the sidewalk :(  The redeeming quality was their chocolates.  I was sorry we only bought one!  It was some dark chocolate espresso ganache number.  All of the flavors were well balance - the fragrant chocolate and the robust espresso with just a hint of sweet.  I'd go back for the chocolates but definitely not the macaroons."}
{"text":"I had a doctor's appointment in the area and I already knew it was going to be a rough appointment. I decided to look up dessert places to go to ahead of time to make myself feel better and found Le Macaron. I have been trying to find a place to go here in AZ to get my macarons from. Macarons are my guilty pleasure. I can down a dozen before getting to back to the car it's embarrassing really.   Were they worth the price I paid for them here? You bet your sweet tooth they were. I loved them and I have finally found my spot here in AZ! The meringue had a nice firm shell with a soft, chewy center. I always love that first bite when my teeth break through the shell and arrive to a gooey center. It's just so satisfying. I liked that the gooey center here wasn't too gooey. I feel like it was just the right amount of gooey so that you get the gooeyness but it doesn't cause the nice crust of the rest of the cookie to get all mushy post first bite if that makes any sense at all. The ganache to meringue cookie ratio was perfect. I was beyond the moon with these macarons. I like that they have a wide assortment of flavors to choose from. I ordered Sicilian pistachio, rose, raspberry, key lime strawberry, lemon creme, Colombian coffee, Madagascar black vanilla, salted caramel, and gingerbread. The flavors were very strong and apparent, but not overwhelming (except for one? See below). What I liked best is that the flavors didn't taste artificial.   My favorite two were Colombian coffee and Madagascar black vanilla. These two were more of the flavor profiles I prefer and man were they amazing! The lemon one was good but it was a little less lemony than I thought it was going to be. My least favorite was the gingerbread. I don't like gingerbread in general so I clearly wasn't thinking when I ordered it. I can see how other people who like gingerbread would like it though. I also wasn't a huge fan of the key lime strawberry. I'm not sure if it was because I ate it after a really strong flavored raspberry one but the flavor wasn't there. If I didn't order it and know what it was supposed to be, I wouldn't be able to tell you what flavor it was. I'm chalking that one up to a taste bud error.   I really showed self constraint this time in only ordering 9 of them and next time I will not be doing that again. I did not order any chocolates or gelato because I had my eyes on a different prize today but maybe a different day when I come back.    The store was super cute, clean, and a lot bigger than it appears online. There were tables inside and a couple outside. The gentleman that was helping me, who I am assuming to be the owner?, was really nice."}
{"text":"This boutique is so clean and classy inside, you pay for the atmosphere but also for the quality of product. I had the mango sorbet and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Incredible! We got an assortment, and all of them were so tasty! They melt in your mouth! Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"A great little shop for French themed treats. We honestly only stopped to check out the shop because it looked so cute from the outside.   We ended up grabbing some of the chocolates, but skipped the macarons (maybe next time). I've got my eye on the macaron ice cream sandwiches this summer.   The eiffel tower chocolate is pure dark chocolate was delicious and nearly too good to eat."}
{"text":"Words can't even describe this amazing place! Two of our most favorite things gelato and macarons!!! After researching the best place in the Phoenix valley for macarons, we repeatedly saw incredible reviews for Le Macaron! We decided to drive over 30mins to see if Le Macarons was truly the best place to get macarons! We surely weren't disappointed!!! The gentleman working was very patient and kind as we were trying to decide what to order first. The atmosphere was so fun, we really felt as though we were in Paris!!! The gelato was the best we have ever had, so smooth and so full of flavor!!! The macarons have set the bar so high! Never have we tasted macarons like this! They were so fresh, slight crunch on the outside and so very soft on the inside. The flavors were amazing...Absolute perfection, not too strong and leaving your mouth wanting more! We have definitely found the best place in the Phoenix valley for macarons!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place...everything from the ambiance to the French baker to the amazing macarons. They have a light flaky outside with tons of flavor on the inside. My favorite is the vanilla. He uses real vanilla bean to make it. My boyfriends favorite is the salted caramel. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Ask for a Banana Foster Crepe! Not on the menu but the man behind the counter will know exactly what it is."}
{"text":"This little French themed place offers a quieter side to the Quarter. Employees are super nice, and the chocolates and macarons are amazing. I take my nieces there are all the time."}
{"text":"This French macaron boutique is one of our regular stops whenever we are in the area. The relaxed, pink-white interior includes an overhead menu, a few small tables here and there, and a glass counter filled with macarons, pastries, and chocolates of all colors, shapes, and sizes.   Each macaron costs $2.75. So far, my gold standard for macaron encompasses the characteristics of a delicate shell, a subtle secondary chew, and a rich, refined ganache to complicate the overall flavors to result in a robust, aromatic bite. Consistent with these descriptors, their macarons are light, delicate, and easy to crumble. However, from our experiences, the shell sometimes had noticeable dry spots, with gaping air pockets under the shells. Moreover, the secondary chew can vary by flavor, with some that simply crumbled in a single bite and others that give the little sticky creamy subtleties with textures and flavors that popped.   Given these inconsistencies, the flavors that I recommend are the Chocolate Praline, Belgian Chocolate, Black Currant, Lavender White Chocolate, Pistachio, and Rose. With the latter three as my top flavors, these macarons are remarkably distinctive in the taste of each shell and the embedded ganache, where the fruit jam or almond center renders a contrasting bright, rising sweetness to the anchoring chocolate, floral, fruity, or nutty flavor in the backdrop. These particular flavors are also more aromatic than the others. At times, the distinctive flavors can be hits of sugar instead of a persistent, long enduring natural wow factor with the ones I had from Bouchon, Café  Breizh, 'Lette, among others.   The Colombian Coffee macaron can be quite flavorful too, but I find the endnote to fall flat due to the missing almond flavor to brighten the profile for it to elaborate and linger. The Vanilla and Lemon Cream macarons are delicately sweet, but also one-dimensional, lacking depth in the chew and profile. Earl Grey Lavender Tea can be a viable option, but I prefer the Lavender White Chocolate for the straight-forward flavor. The Salted Caramel is a sensible possibility for those who wish to play it safe.  My least favorite macarons are the Passion Fruit Dark Chocolate, and White Basil Chocolate. Do not get the Key Lime Strawberry, the one I got was hard, dry, too sweet, and the skimpy fruit jam was a failure. The balance and combination of these flavors need further refinement. It was difficult to grasp the concepts underlying these flavors. Just try a Pistachio macaron next to any of these flavors and you will see the difference in quality and taste.  Overall, above average, falling short of being outright amazing. Service-wise, I find the young woman from Mexico City the most enthusiastic, helpful, and informative. With others, I was underwhelmed, and expected an equally refined experience with a little more explanation of the ideas that went into each flavor. I encourage prospective customers to make decisions based on flavors, and not on the colors of these macarons, something that we tend to do with our sensory. All the highlights and limitations accounted for, I still find their product worthwhile and rudimentary to the core concepts of French macarons. 3.5 stars for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Nice macaron plce. Macaron on the icecream looks good as well. I am not a fan of macaron but my wife and my dauvghter liked it. It was not better than the one that we had in paris. The place has nice seats and good place to hang out with family and friends. They did not explain whether they make those macarons there or bringing from somewhere. It would have beenn great if they explained how it is made since macaron is not a common dessert that u can find here."}
{"text":"This place is too cute with its Paris decor and lovely macarons!! The sales associate was very helpful and knowledgable and explained all the flavors and history of the macaron. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because he never offered us samples to taste. If I'm ever back in Scottsdale & looking for macarons, I will definitely stop back at this delectable place!!"}
{"text":"Gelato was AWESOME.  I had pistachio and vanilla bean.  The vanilla bean had so much flavor!!!  Taking home macarons."}
{"text":"So excited to have a gelato and macaron place close by. We came on a Wednesday night and it was quiet, seems like people stop by, order and leave. My friend got macarons and she liked them; I wanted chocolate gelato and the guy told me it comes with two scoops so I added creme brûlée. The chocolate tasted kinda funny but the creme brûlée was delicious! Wish they had coffee gelato when I visited but they didn't, they rotate some of the flavors out.   Cute spot, prices are expensive for macarons compared to other places I've been to but I'll have to try them next time and see if I like them."}
{"text":"Cute place but seems to cater to tourists. I got lavender white chocolate and salted caramel macarons. Lavender white chocolate was my favorite while the salted caramel did not really taste like salted caramel. My husband's strawberry key lime had a hollow shell on the inside, what happens when you mess up baking macarons, and the fruit flavor tasted artificial. There could have been more filling in all the macarons we ordered, the outer edges had no filling.  Probably a lot better than getting macarons at Starbucks."}
{"text":"Such a prefect dessert after going to zinburger! Look at this eclair. It's chocolate cream inside. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  I walked into great music...classic rock!  Howard was awesome, great costumer service and crepes.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Some consider a six-pack as a collection of beer. Others may think of sculpted washboard abs. I prefer to think of a half dozen macarons. :)  Macarons, gelato, coffee, and chocolates? Awesome! After hearing all the good things about this little macaron shop I decided to stop by and indulge in some French sweets. The interior is pretty much the essence of \"girliness\" with bright pink accents and Paris themed decor.   Le Macaron is a franchise with most locations in Florida. The Scottsdale Quarter store is the only one in Arizona. I stepped in and browsed through the mouthwatering cases of chocolates and macarons. I decided on a 6 pack of macarons and a single chocolate for a small taste of dessert.  The chocolate case held beautifully decorated, jewel-like sweets. Most of them had a glossy shiny sheen that added to their brilliance. The mango key lime chocolate I had ($2.20 for one) was a good balance of tart and sweet filling. The chocolate shell was good, but the viscosity was a little off for me in contrast with the soft gooey filling. My own personal preference would be to have the chocolate either a little softer so it melts in the mouth with the filling or a crisper shell to provide textural difference.  They had a wide array of macaron flavors with a few unique floral/herbal themed selections such as rose, basil, and lavender. My six pack consisted of gingerbread, white chocolate mint, dark chocolate passion fruit, black currant, orange chocolate Gran Marnier, and Sicilian Pistachio. Most of the macarons had a perfect texture with a lightly crisp exterior and very slightly chewy soft center for contrast. My passion fruit dark chocolate was either very slightly overcooked or an older batch and thus more evenly crunchy though. For the most part I enjoyed the flavors. Note that the white chocolate mint is made from spearmint flavor rather than peppermint (Not a fan of spearmint). I also thought the gingerbread had an odd slightly soapy aftertaste to it. My favorites of the bunch were the pistachio, orange chocolate Gran Marnier, and black currant.   Service was very friendly and the woman at the counter packaged my macaron bounty very well.   My total for 6 macarons and 1 chocolate was a little less than $20. A little pricey, but hey it's Scottsdale. When I walked out I noticed the sign for affogato which I will definitely have to try next time!"}
{"text":"Yeah I wanted to try their gelato. When a clerk finally came out of the back, a customer immediately interrupted with a neverending complicated order that was a much higher priority than serving the person who was waiting (me). No doubt I'm a b!tch for not understanding my innate inferiority. So know where you stand in the pecking order before entering these sacred halls."}
{"text":"Such a cute place with and such polite staff. I stopped in with a friend from out of town and we absolutely loved it! I highly recommend the ice cream sandwich macaron."}
{"text":"Pretty decent macarons although a bit pricey. I have had the Laduree macarons in Hong Kong and some other very good ones in San Francisco so I am biased. These were well constructed, being very crispy on the outside with firm filling centers. I just couldn't tell what flavor I was eating, they all tasted about the same.  Very beautiful looking chocolates, next time I go there, I might go for an apple tart or a piece of chocolate and a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"We've been to this quaint cafe a few times. Every time we've been greeted with a smile and always courteous service. Good Nespresso coffee and macarons. Delicious chocolates and freshly made crepes! Croissants are wonderful - buttery & flaky!!! We have not tried the gelato yet because we love good coffee and desserts."}
{"text":"Meh. They were stale and the guy working there was pretty off putting. I've had macaroons in Paris and at Essence locally and these were not near as good and overpriced. Next."}
{"text":"After lunch today, we went to Le Macaron for dessert.  Two of my favorite things are gingerbread and macarons.    Le Macaron has gingerbread macarons and is the only place I have ever seen gingerbread macarons. The gingerbread macarons are very good.  My friend had a lemon meringue tart and a cappuccino which she said was better than anything she had ever had in Europe (or anywhere else).   She said the next time we are at the Scottsdale Quarter we should have lunch at Le Macaron and just eat a lot of french pastries."}
{"text":"My first experience ever having tasted a macaron took place here, and it did not disappoint. The pistachio is my favorite. The array of unique flavors is such a delight. Each time I've visited I was greeted politely and truly felt welcomed. This is my top choice for dessert in the area, without question. The portion sizes (gelato) are proper portions; they're not massive, which is truly a breath of fresh air. Less is more. I adore this place and can't wait to try some of the items left unexplored."}
{"text":"Ooh la la! Best spot in Scottsdale for a sweet treat and coffee! Delicious macarons, Nutella crepes Afogado (expresso coffee and gelato) and chocolate truffles. A must try, cute place and great service. You might think you are in Paris!!!"}
{"text":"Tops for Macaroons and Truffles  One of the best options for macaroons in Arizona-- crisp, sweet, and wonderful flavors accentuating the nutty breading. My wife and I are especially enamored with the pistachio, lavender, and passion mango flavors.  On this occasion, we ordered a tray of macaroons and truffles for Christmas dessert. The latter were crazy good... and expensive. But still worth it!  Very nice service staff, as well. The gal who served us was fun and patient, as we tried to make up our mind on what our family members would enjoy."}
{"text":"Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich was sooooo yummy and $3 something wasn't asking to much so I couldn't complain on bit! Staff is very friendly and location is lovely great for meeting a friend or dropping in while on a date. But I just wish prices where not so crazy on Macaroons it was like a box of 4 for nearly $10.... definitely one of the most expensive places I've been to for them and I probably won't ever get to try them because of it unless I'm just getting one for a taste."}
{"text":"We found the perfect dessert place after walking around Scottsdale Quarters. Le Macaron French Pastries offers macaron, chocolate and gelato.   We got 4 macarons for $2.75 each: matcha, bailey, mint white chocolate & rose.   The flavors were very pronounced. My favorites were bailey and rose. The cookie shell was perfectly airy.  We also got this really cute Eiffel Tower milk chocolate for $2.40. The chocolate wasn't bad.   The macarons were handmade from scratch and gluten free.   The ladies were so sweet. They are sweeter than the macaron itself, which is a good thing :)   4 stars!!  Le Macaron French Pastries is yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"Best macarons I've had in the the US outside Paris.  They were fresh and tasty.  Nice little cafe at Scottsdale Quarter.  If you are a fan of French macarons - i'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful macarons!! I had the chance to sample a variety of flavors.  They all were delicious but my favorite was the Madagascar Vanilla! So delicious.  We also bought some chocolate eclairs for our sons! They approve!! I think their only complaint was for the eclairs being too small!! Lol We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"The macarons are amazing, the taste and texture is different from all that I've eaten. I never was a fan of macarons until I tasted theirs. I'll be back for sure. Oh and don't forget the gelato and nutella crepes! I had to have all of it."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! Very cute, clean and cheerful interior in the Scottsdale quarter. The gelato is delicious, the macaroons are to die for and my personal favorites are the chocolates (which are decorated beautifully...they look like glass)! This place is a little pricey but definitely worth the money! They have a few tables inside to enjoy there but I usually just get my treats to go! I've been there a few times now and every employee that has assisted me has been an absolute delight!"}
{"text":"Fantastic macarons and gelato!  Very welcoming place.  We ordered six different flavors- our favorites were the white chocolate lavender and Belgian chocolate.  Very light and delicate.  They tasted very fresh, not processed at all.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a sweets person but I do appreciate a good Macon! And this is my only go-to place in Scottsdale for macaron cravings!!! My favorites are lavender, coffee, salted caramel, rose, and coconut - reminds me of the ones I had in Europe - not exactly but close enough. The store has a modem and contemporary look. It has a small lounging area which is so cute and adorable."}
{"text":"Four stars for the ice cream/gelato, three stars for the macarons, and four stars for the friendly owner at the store. The violet gelato was really good - it was lighter and airier than other gelato but went really well together with the creme brûlée flavor. I also got a box of six macarons . I liked the vanilla one but the other flavors were drier, even when I tried them on the same day as when I bought them. I would stick with a place that makes macarons onsite instead of here, but if you're looking for ice cream, this place is a much better option than Creamistry across the way."}
{"text":"Very pleasant staff and expertly crafted French pastries. Great attention to detail. Pastries are served on real ceramic plates with real utensils and coffee is served in real ceramic mugs, an add on that is seldom found in such a convenient place."}
{"text":"Incredible custom French pastries. The chocolates are just amazing some of the best chocolates I have ever tasted. Definitely worth the trip and the price if you have not been I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"It's so sparkly in there so just be prepared!! They have the most beautiful truffles, that I couldn't bear to eat.  I did try 3 of the macrons a Basil White Chocolate, Black Currant and a Paradise Fruit with Dark chocolate and they were absolutely delectable.  They also have espresso and other coffee drinks, I was too busy looking at all the pretty things to notice much else but it's a beautiful store, definitely a great first date or a place for dessert after!  Totally can't wait to buy some for future parties!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Le Macaron after coming here so many times! It is one of my favorite places for mommy meet ups and playdates. Walking in, one wouldn't think \"kid friendly\" because it's so pretty and chic. Think lots of pink, feathers, chocolates, macarons, eiffel towers... I dream of designing one of my rooms like it! The owners, a French couple, are the cutest. So sweet and friendly. It's been really nice because they've gotten to know my friends and I since our children were infants and now they are toddlers running around the place. I look forward to bringing our kids here as they grow older. It's really nice to support a small, family-owned business, especially when they are so hospitable, charismatic and let our kids enjoy themselves (even when they make a little mess).   Besides macarons which are quite pricy but delectable, Le Macaron offers croissants, gourmet chocolates, gelato, crepes, and my very favorite -- some sort of secret iced coffee that's really really good! The owners go into the back to prepare it and I don't know what they put in it but it's sooo good! My friends and I often make plans to meet up here just for their iced coffee. We then head out to enjoy shopping and letting our kids run around the outdoor area at Scottsdale Quarter.   Chic. Yummy. Come here."}
{"text":"If this is what heaven looks like, I am so ready to go...  But seriously...this place is heavenly. We drove 40 minutes all the way from Chandler just to come here. I first saw this place from the news few months ago...and let me tell you..it was worth the drive. The store is well organized, clean and welcoming. I initially only came here for Macaroons only and then my eyes drifted to the delicious/well decorated chocolates. They were so pretty looking that I don't think I even want to bite into it. As I was drooling over the window....I saw Gelato!!!! At that point on I was getting ready to lose it.  I dropped over $70 here. A little more than what I preferred to spend. But it was worth every penny. I love how soft and tasty the macaroons are. I also got a box as a gift and they even went out of their ways to decorate it for me. On my way out, I also got some Gelatos and it was absolutely delicious.   I honestly don't think I can afford to eat here all the time, but for sure I will come back here again for more goodies."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere! Very clean! Very delicious macarons! The coffee is also incredible. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"I didn't try the macaron but pastries and ice cream were just perfect. Very good atmosphere. Will come back for sure"}
