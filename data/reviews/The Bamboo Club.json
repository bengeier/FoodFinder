{"text":"Purty darn nice lil' ole asian restaurant. Good drinks and good enough food.  It's in a very weird location though, up an escalator in sort of a mall-ish building on one of the main drags through Tempe.  Nice chill atmosphere and good service. No complaints about this place."}
{"text":"I like it, and LOVE the Strawberry Lemonade (sorry wait staff... they are hard to make, but taste oh so good). Also you can over look and see passers by on the balcony."}
{"text":"For the most part, I agree with the recurring themes in the previous Bamboo Club reviews - the cool atmosphere (especially the balcony overlooking Mill Avenue), the good service, and yes, the good but not great food - but with a couple of exceptions. The Mandarin Orange Tofu is so delicious. It comes with spinach on the side, and I don't know what they do to it (is it fried?) but I can't get enough of it. It's called Mandarin Orange Chicken on the menu - Bamboo Club will substitute tofu for meat in any of their dishes (I recommend vegetarians still inquire about sauce ingredients). I also recommend the Asian Tofu with Vegetables. Quite tasty.  This is usually a lunch spot for me and a co-worker or two or three, but I've also been here with larger groups on several different occasions - much larger groups (20-30 people), and always received excellent service. In fact, the first time our \"event organizer\" failed to order any vegetarian dishes, the Bamboo Club staff - after apologizing (not their fault!) - responded quickly and efficiently, providing several meat-free options without question or extra charge.  The food I think deserves between 3 and 3 1/2 stars, but the good service and cool atmosphere push them up to 4."}
{"text":"When I found out we were headed to \"The Bamboo Club\" my first thought was to change out a couple of twenties for some singles.   Upon arriving my stomach was pleasantly suprised that The Bamboo Club was not an Asian themed strip club, and in fact a restaurant. Seriously, who names a restaurant \"The Bamboo Club\"?  Needless to say the food was right on par with most strip clubs.  2 Stars, because the service was decent and the food and drinks were paid for by work, HIGH FIVE!"}
{"text":"First the postives:  Great locations, easy to find, lots of parking, nice decor/atmosphere, cozy booths, friendly staff, interesting name.  The place was very clean. Food started off OK with the combination appetizer plate.   Pot stickers were good.  Expensive.  Negatives:  Food was not good.  Had the spicy fish dish, tasted like sweet and sour pork with chili peppers with plain steamed asparagus on the side (yuk).  Others had the Steamed halibut - no taste, lettuce wraps - mushy and a bit salty, chow mein - ok.    In summary, overpriced want to be PF Changs, but at least PF Changs food is good."}
{"text":"everyone seems to hate this place,and i do now, but there was one day when i didnt.   it was my first visit to phoenix and we could walk there from my moms new condo where everyone seemed to be a midwestern jew so i felt right at home. until i went out with a friend and saw more anorexy fake boobied blondes than i could imagine in any ryan reynolds movie. and NOOOO dive bars (next time im in town- youll all have to tell me where they are). actually there was one dive bar that was great, in a strip mall that had bar shuffle board.  the one and only day that i liked the bamboo club was the first time i got orange shrimp. it was fucking unreal. it was on this bed of crispy spinach with a mild orangey sauce and i LOVED it. every time ive been back we have gone here to get the orange shrimp and every time it has sucked more and more. the last time, in june, we went to the one in tempe and it was not only the worst service and coldest air conned mofo but that spinach was soggy. shameful. i wish i could take back my first time (not the first time ive said that) though i doubt i will ever learn that this place sucks shit now and will waste a meal every time i visit:("}
{"text":"the food's ok, but it's more the ambiance that i like. it's located on the second floor of the biz park right on mill, but hidden back from thebusy street so it feels intimate. you can only get HH in the bar area and that drives me crazy when rest.s do that.  the pad thai is so-so, the crab puffs have a sweet something added to them that i hate. pricing is a little on the expensive side for what it is, but the rest. area is very nice for an intimate yet still someone hip and pulsating night on the town."}
{"text":"If the fact that they closed at Biltmore doesn't say something.....I'd rather stab myself in the hand w/ a fork than eat there! Ugh!!"}
{"text":"food is not bad... not my first place for asian in PHX, but i do like sitting at the bar from time to time... i also find the food hit or miss..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here a while back. The food was really good, but he found a screw (yes, piece of hardware) in his rice. Which would normally strike me as really gross, but the screw was very clean and shiny...not covered in rust or anything too repulsive. ;) It's a good thing he didn't bite down on it and break a tooth.   We notified the staff, who were very apologetic and told us they were \"tearing apart the kitchen to find out where the screw came from.\" They never figured it out. The manager had my boyfriend write a statement and provide his address so they could mail him vouchers. They also gave us the whole meal for free. I didn't expect the -entire- meal for free, so that was nice.   I'd go back because the food was good and the staff responded well to such a weird incident. But .... we never got those vouchers."}
{"text":"I've dined at this location a handful of times...usually to meet up with friends who live in the East Valley. (since Desert Ridge is a nice half way point) Honestly, I have no complaints.   The service has always been very good as the waitstaff is very attentive. The only thing I have had there is the Grilled Halibut with Mango Salsa on an Asparagus \"raft.\" Delicious! Actually, I have also enjoyed the steamed side of veggies which is wonderful as well. My husband has tried the Lemongrass Chicken and really enjoy it as well as the Crispy Honey Chicken dish.   My most recent visit was on 10/11/08...although pricey, we walked away without complaints."}
{"text":"Great ambiance for a Asian fusion restaurant, but where are my Asian peeps at???  The hostess-white, our waiter-black, our busboy-Mexican, but on my way to the restroom I finally find them.... The two cooks were Chinese.  The group of us were all from Asian decent and we asked our waiter to recommend some dishes.  When he mentioned kung pao and chop suey, I also busted out laughing.  The food was decent and their idea of brown rice is white rice tossed in soy sauce.  Oh yeah, you had to request chop sticks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm glad I live in the Bay Area.  If you want to try this place, get the Vietnamese beef cubes, the Korean seared steak, the deep fried whole flounder and the fried spinach that tasted like chips."}
{"text":"I liked this place when I lived in AZ.  I really liked the Orange Peel Chicken with the brown rice....the only thing I didn't like there was the fried spinach (yuck).  The drinks there were pretty good too."}
{"text":"And yet another closure. Why are my go-to places losing the battle?  I will miss your patio and cheap, cheap appetizers. Though you weren't all that, and not even the chips, you were always accessible and affordable.  Cheers to you."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is crowded.  And the food is simply fair to good.  I had heard quite a bit about this venue prior to going, and have to say, I was slightly disappointed.  They seem to be understaffed, as the service was a bit slow.  I've been here 3 times, and the best time I had was sitting at the bar, but I think that was due more to the beautiful blonde I was sitting next to, than the restaurant.  Parking is attrocious, as well."}
{"text":"\"Asian Fusion\" not sure I agree with the concept... I've eaten at two of these restaurants, the one near Tempe, and the one in north Scottsdale...  The food is good, the place trendy... the Scottsdale location has a nice outdoor seating area, nice for a date when the weather is correct..."}
{"text":"This location of The Bamboo Club is not ideal for groups... I was there last night and the service was awful.  Our waitress took a long time and had to be reminded about simple things such as chopsticks and water refills.  They pushed their special group menu on us and it was way too much food - much more than we needed.  Then, to top it all off, when we put our credit cards down at the end, they screwed up several times so that some of the group was overcharged and some not charged enough...  I recommend this place for the food only and with a group of 4 or less... the chicken lettuce wraps are pretty good, the calamari salad is spicy but tasty, and if you are leaning toward eating really healthy, they offer edamame and entrees of steamed veggies with shrimp or chicken.    Don't pass up the dessert of fresh berries with vanilla ice cream - at least we ended the meal with something sweet :)"}
{"text":"My partner should be the one writing this review, but since he doesn't have a yelp account, it's up to me to let you know how incredibly bad this place is.  Just in case you don't want to read any further we wholeheartedly recommend going to Albertson's or any other grocery store, buying any type of Lean Cuisine Asian Entree and heating it up in your microwave. It would be ten times better than The Bamboo Club.  Now since you've gotten this far I'll tell you the whole long drawn-out story.   Three weeks ago we moved to Aviano at Desert Ridge. The unfortunate part is there are NO locally owned restaurants anywhere nearby, none, zip, nada. That leaves only the chains at Desert Ridge Mail and we don't like most chain restaurants.   So I started the day with a trip to Tucson to see my Aunt and Uncle. Since I wasn't going to get back until about 7:00 PM we decided before I left that we would eat out. Tom decided he wanted Asian Food and when I got back home he was starving. He initially suggested Tang's Asian Bistro, but when we found out it was an \"order at the counter\" type of place we decided to go across the street to The Bamboo Club. What a HUGE mistake.   We've been to other Bamboo Club's in the past and haven't like the food, plus the are incredibly overpriced. We will NEVER go again.   You have to understand, my partner is very forgiving and pretty easy going...he puts up with me. But, tonight here's how he described The Bamboo Club:  \"This is terrible\" \"I was looking for something in the dish I liked, but I just can't. It's really bad\" \"I don't like either of these dishes. Neither of them are anything special\" \"God, that was awful\" \"I would've rather gone to Panda Express\"  As you can see, it was VERY BAD. Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Bamboo Club, seriously?.... For Tempe, clearly 4 stars. Balcony over-looking Mill Ave, semi-mediocre beer selection and the clientele. Son.  I waltzed in with the intentions to be on a liquid diet and just enjoy myself in cozy fashion. Met a new friend full of moxie, put on my best performance to this day and bounced onto venue #2 with whats-her-name on me arm.  Nice!"}
{"text":"Bamboo club is way overpriced and definitely not Asian. The food is rather on the bland side for being Asian food and just not served correctly. I once had to argue with a waiter that instead of mahi mahi I was eating the second dish I ordered--Mabu Tofu! Don't care for this place at all, I have yet to find my enjoyable chinese food place for dinner I guess that will just have to wait."}
{"text":"I like the Bamboo Club, but it doesn't seem to bode well with purists. It is a very Americanized spin on Chinese food, with some dishes it works well and others not so much.   I struggle with a fierce addiction to Panda Express so I refer to it from time to time, but I feel I'm justified this time. Bamboo Club is like a deluxe version of Panda Express. In fact, their best dish is also the orange chicken, only done much more tastefully than their greasy counterparts.   It's a little overpriced considering what they are offering (semi-glorified mall food) but, all in all, not bad."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice.  I think both the food and drinks are a little overpriced for what it is but I know the rent down on Mill is marginally insane.  I've never had a wait here and the food comes out fairly quickly.  Occasionally I've had a server disappear for a while but that's the exception, not the rule.  My favorite things on the menu are the Crispy Crab Wontons which are served with a strawberry sauce instead of the more traditional sweet and sour, and the Drunken Monkey Flambe - which is somewhere between Bananas Foster and Cheesecake on fire.  They have a wide selection of specialty drinks but none of them really catch my imagination.  The food itself is ok, sort of like PF Changs upped their prices but didn't up the quality or presentation of their food.  This is a place I go because I'm meeting people who want to meet there, not necessarily a place I would ever choose.  The sad thing is that it's not because it's godawful.  It's really not bad.  But between the pretentious decor and the mediocre food I always end up feeling slightly let down by the restaurant experience.  It's like dating that person who you can find no real flaws with but somehow you still lack chemistry.  Sorry Bamboo Club. It's not you, it's me."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to get along with this place given the neo-asian decor.  Very modern.  Good stuff.  Then the hostess sat us and opened her mouth: \"Have you ever had Asian food before?\"  To a mixed group, where 1/3 of us were Asian.  She explained how soy sauce works. She explained how to use chopsticks. She explained how hot oil works.  I politely listened, but in the end, the food reminded me of PF Chang's.    The food works, but it's not competitive at all if the restaurant wants to do well.  Apparently, I learned that it's a chain that is based in the southwest, but hasn't made it's way to California yet, or ever.    That's fine with me.    I don't want to knock it so hard because of the hostess, but first impressions are important."}
{"text":"Just like PF Changs, but IMHO, a little better.  It's a little bit more expensive than Chang's, but a nicer joint inside.  I was a regular for their reverse happy hour....then I got sick of the Mill scene and moved on.    Anyhow.  Food is decent.  It's no where even close to authentic.  Again, it's comparable to Chang's.  If you're thinking about Chang's, try this place out.  You might like this over Chang's."}
{"text":"Bamboo Club Asian Bistro is a corporate chain of about 10 restaurants, most in AZ, trying to capitalize on the success of that other AZ HQ chain, PF Chang's. The formula is provide Panda Express food in an upscale \"Bistro\" environment, add table service and a bar, so you can charge more to ignorant Americans who love their sweet and sour pork in a CPK like atmosphere, then expand to locations and sales to eventually go public and cash out before the trend fades. Someone took me to the upscale Biltmore Shopping Center one in Phoenix. I could do better in any Chinatown."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5.   This particular Bamboo Club was so-so.  The food was good, although they didn't serve me what I ordered which was a disappointment since I was looking forward to one of my favorites.  I'd chock that up to just a bonehead waiter.  It's decent \"Americanized\" Asian food if you like big chains like PF Chang's and Pei Wei, but it's not \"true\" Asian food to me and I didn't expect that it would be.  I'll still go there on occasion, but I'll be on the look out for more independent locales with more authentic fare.  I think I need to venture more towards the East Valley for that..."}
{"text":"Bamboo Club is definitely a hidden gem on Mill. Thanks to my boyfriend because I would have never noticed it in it's upstairs location at the business park. This is also one of only restaurants I have been to on Mill that had a relaxing and intimate vibe.   The food is a little pricey but it was very good. The menu offers various choices of the 'Asian Bistro\". My boyfriend sticks to the Orange Chicken, which is the freshest Orange Chicken I have ever tried. I had the Shrimp Pad Thai which was nice and spicy just the way I like it.  Our service was excellent and the manager was walking around making sure everyone was doing well. Definitely a place I would recommend for special occasions or a quiet date, just make sure you have the budget.    Go get in on the zen atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Not sure about the other Bamboo Clubs in the Phoenix area, but this one.....uh.......I wouldn't go there again if you paid me.   Yes that sounds very harsh.  I will say that it was not the wait staff that is causing me to give such a poor review, our waiter was friendly, and prompt.  The food however......leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the lunch special which consists of a soup, an appetizer, and a main course all for $9.95. Not bad huh? Yeah well I think there is a reason for the 'steal of a deal' pricing.  So let me break it down for ya.....  - Iced tea tasted like steamed cardboard.  I think it was supposed to be green tea...but not 100% sure.  - Wonton soup, not too bad, but the pork tasted rubbery.  - Fried rice almost made me vomit. Seriously folks.  Without going into Drama Queen mode...let me just say EEEEW.  I could have sworn they cooked band-aids with the rice because that's how it tasted.  - The crab wontons...too crabby and peppery.   - The mandarin orange chicken, eh..so-so. That was about the only thing I picked at on my plate. I'm hoping that it was really chicken and not some other animal because it did look a little strange for chicken.  We did get seated quickly and got our food in a flash. Our waiter was very courteous and the environment is pretty cool. It's just a shame that the food was so incredibly bad."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Bamboo. They had decent food, super cheap happy hour and awesome, friendly staff. Their Bloody Mary's mixed with siracha and soy were different and delicious. Another one bites the Mill Ave dust :("}
{"text":"Great mix of Asian cuisine. Notice I said Asian and NOT Chinese because calling that would really give the wrong impression of what they have to offer.  Good atmosphere, friendly service. Some really different things on their menu. Recommend their Fried Spinach and an ice cold Asahi to start things out.  But definitely EXPLORE their menu and resist the temptation of 'the same old orange flavor chicken'..."}
{"text":"The Bamboo Club has got me all mixed up. Can ambiance and service compensate for sub par food at ridiculous prices? Oh, the dilemma! I like the beautiful decor and attentive service, but I also like reasonably priced entrees with discernable flavor. Let's see...nope. Well that didn't take very long to decide.  I've eaten at this location several times. The last time was with a very large group of people, and I got to try many different things off the menu. It basically boiled down to two flavor categories: spicy or non-spicy. The spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in one stock sauce. The non-spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in a similar sauce that omitted the chili oil. Here and there they added other things, like black bean paste or some sweetness, but most of the dishes tasted pretty much the same. I suppose this is why the menu doesn't go into detail when describing the difference between entrees, just listing \"Mongolian Chicken\" or \"BC Hot and Spicy Chicken,\" since just the veggies and protein are interchangeable and no really strong flavor characterizes any one dish.   We started off with the appetizer sampler: Sesame Honey Chicken, BC Egg Rolls, Coconut Shrimp, and Pot Stickers. Everything was perfectly adequate and worth the price since it served 4 people. The chicken was crispy, sweet and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The egg rolls tasted like they had been fried in old oil, but I fixed that by dousing it in hot mustard. The coconut shrimp were thin, crunchy, and not too sweet. The pot stickers were steamed with a delicious pork filling, probably the best thing on the tray. It was all pretty good filler before the meal. But it's kind of a sad affair when the appetizers trump the actual main course...  Everything came out really fast for a group of nine people and was piping hot. We shared it family style and here's the details, from best entree to worst: *Cantonese Noodles- Wicked fricken good! If I end up going again, I'm definitely ordering this dish. Shrimp, scallops, BBQ pork, chicken and Asian vegetables with wheat noodles tossed in a light but flavorful sauce. *Grilled Halibut- Well cooked and flaky. Mango and pineapple salsa was decent and the presentation was very well done. *Chicken with Asparagus- I was barely able to distinguish the black bean sauce it was supposedly cooked in, but the chicken was tender and the asparagus al dente.  *BC Spicy Chicken- This falls under the 'spicy' category of food flavoring. It was a little spicy, a little sweet, and very generic. Supposedly their equivalent of 'Kung Pao,' but it tasted...weirder than any other Kung Pao I've had.  *Mandarin Orange Scallops- Tough and overcooked, same flavors as the BC Spicy Chicken but with more sugar and no kick. The crispy spinach was interesting though. *Bamboo Bejing Duck- It was overcooked and dry rather than being crispy. The Asian pancakes were also dry, but the accompanying plum sauce lubricated things well enough.  *Pad Thai Rice Noodles- Turned into a sticky noodle block after the first couple minutes. I've made the equivalent from a box in the 'Asian foods' aisle at Fry's.  *Thai Curry Chicken and Shrimp- The Bamboo Club needs to focus on their Chinese offerings instead of their piss poor Thai dishes. Not good by any stretch of the imagination.  The side dishes were, like the appetizers, respectable but not amazing. The Dynasty Fried Rice tasted a lot like any other fried rice you'd order. No surprise or disappointment there. The Woked Mushrooms were very well cooked in a light sauce. Much better than most of the entrees even though it was a side dish. The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus. Perhaps it just lacked the dollop of black bean paste?  So if you go, go for the ambiance. The patio is nice for Mill Avenue people watching and secluded enough to enjoy your meal with a little privacy. The service is attentive and quick to refill any glass or comply with your requests, even for a large group of people. At the very least these guys deserve the high tips generated by pricy entrees. It's too bad the food is so damn generic. Definitely not worth the 13-25 dollar price tag per entree.   Maybe happy hour is the best option for attending this place? Cheap three dollar appetizers and drink specials without the unnecessary disappointment of crappy food? Maybe I'll give it a whirl in the future.  If you're wrangled into dinner there, go with the Cantonese noodles, crispy spinach and woked veggies. Best stuff on the menu. Or risk it and order something else. Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over."}
{"text":"Ugh. I realize now that any place with the words club, factory or n things in their name I'm gonna give 2 stars or less. Or the word rainforest. But that's a different story. I dared to try something exotic. Salt and pepper shrimp. Hey, I'm Scandanavian. Pepper is an exotic spice to my people. But, I'm sorry, pepper must have been 86d that day. It was more like Salt shrimp. Or Soggy ass salt shrimp. Not good. We had the obligatory chain restaurant appetizer combo. No Awesome Blossom here folks. But overall this beat the entrees. Chased down with a lychee nut cocktail I was ready to quit this club. Service was amiable, but we were stuck in a corner, blocked in by a large party, with, ugh, children. Or as I so affectionately called them, Children of the Corn. Not much joy in this club. Or luck with entree selection. So I say no. No to the Joyless Luckless Bamboo Club."}
{"text":"Bamboo Club = Decent  Decent beer selection, though nothing I'd go out of my way to have. Drink options for those who prefer mixed cocktails. Decent wine choices, too.   The food is always decent - average, satisfactory without the wow-factor. Last time here I split the Macadamia Nut Chicken, which was served with water chestnuts, pieces of celery and tender broccoli stalks. We went with the brown rice to complement the dish.   Edamama was okay. Service is always decent. Friendly and attentive, if not a little absent-minded.   Decor and atmosphere are decent. Bathrooms are clean, with alot of mirrors - even a full-length at the back of each stall. Uhm, ok.   Bamboo Club is a \"safe bet\" when you're on Mill Ave. The upstairs factor is cool. So is the idea of an outside patio, overlooking the street.   If you go here looking for pandas, all you'll find is bamboo. (And no, that's not a metaphor.) Wait for the fortune cookie. It comes with a little panda on the wrapping. Inside the cookie, though, are messages that are cryptic and unusual. Fortune, my ass. Mine read: \"Be definite now, worry about precision later.\" Fortune Cooke Panda needs to take grammar lessons. Talk about an annoying comma splice.   Anyway...   Bamboo Club = Decent Decent = 3 stars"}
{"text":"I have nothing compelling to say because this restaurant is unremarkable.  The food is good.  I have eaten here a few times when I was with a group.  I wouldn't ever choose it on my own accord."}
