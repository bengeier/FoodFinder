{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service. The restaurant is tucked into a small space amid the Shops on Beverly Road in Mt. Lebanon, and it fits in perfectly. 
My wife and I have dined here on dates and also with our toddler, and were accommodated equally well in either case. The take out is also a great option."}
{"text":"We loved this place until tonight. The chef/owner screamed at me because I did not like the sauce on my pasta and ordered something else. He had the waiter charge me for both dishes and then came out of the kitchen to scream at me for about 5 minutes. 
We are disappointed because we have recommended this place to dozens of people and went there about once a week for months. I cannot believe that this happened and I will be sure to tell anyone who will listen to take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I stopped into Cafe Io on a weekday night and it is a charming little cafe. The crispy green bean appetizer is awesome; the beans are still al dente with a light breeding that does not overwhelm the vegetable. I had the veggie grilled cheese with tomato basil soup. I would have liked grilled instead of toasted bread and more melted cheese to prevent the vegetables from making the bread soggy on the bottom, but the flavored were great and the soup especially good. My companion had the orrechiette, which was flavorful and simple. We were both happy with the experience and especially the excellent service. The menu has a bit of something for everyone - from higher end specials and entrees to pastas, sandwiches and burgers as well as salads. If you haven't tried what is apparently a new model for Cafe Io, check it out."}
{"text":"I recently went to Caf√© Io for the first time and got only a cup of soup as my entre as I was between two dental surgeries and had to watch what I was eating.  Ordered  the butternut squash, sausage and can't-remember-what-the-other-ingredients-were  soup, which was a special that day.  It was exceptional.  It had flavor upon flavor upon flavor.  Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Had a Great meal here again. There is something on the menu for everyone, we had a party of all ages that had wide range of tastes and everyone was Happy. The service was top notch. Suggest the bean & greens."}
{"text":"Love this little place! 


The flavors, portions, and prices are perfect. This is a great spot for lunch with the girlfriends or a casual but still intimate dinner date. 

Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Very good food..just a little to noisey for my liking"}
{"text":"Thought the food was really well prepared and creative. 

I had the crab cake sandwich and sweet fries. I thought it was refreshing and well prepared. They utilize to small crab cakes for each side of the sandwich. 

They also toasted the sandwich bread which gave it an interesting texture but by the time you got to the second half the bottom piece of bread was soggy on both sandwiches. 

Look forward to visiting again and trying a cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Definitely looking forward to checking Cafe Io out given the positive reviews. Unfortunately there must be a lot of people whom live in the Dormont/Mt. Lebo area that have no idea what good food is supposed to taste like. I had the poutine app to start, which was a bust. The gravy was watered down and they served it with beef slices which wasn't what I was expecting. Needless to say, the beef was on par with something I could get at Arby's. 

The Pittsburgh Crab Cake sandwich was such a disappointment. Nothing about it was unique and I've had better quality of crab cakes from Giant Eagle. One tiny crab cake between two pieces of generic white toast. The bread it was served on was certainly not homemade. Tasted like toasted Wonder Bread to me. Fries that were placed on the sandwich were nothing special. Didn't seemed seasoned at all either

Overall, nothing at Cafe Io is something special and you're better off saving your money and making whatever is on their menu at home. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Disinterested service. Awful food. We went on burger night, which means the normally 11 dollar burgers are only 9 dollars. This would have been awesome if the burgers were actually good, but unfortunately they were dry and flavorless lumps of ground beef with very few ingredients. The fries were oven baked supermarket fries with no seasoning added-- not even salt. The place is tiny and cramped. I have no idea how they justify the prices they charge for such bland and uninteresting food.
I honestly have nothing good to say about my experience at this place other than the company I dined with."}
{"text":"First impression - the place is closed. No sign out front. Frosted glass bearing the name of the place cannot be seen from across the street. Bleh. 

Once inside, I wanted to like the place since it seemed fresh and cool. Smiling waitstaff. That was the best moment of the lunch experience.

Moderately interesting menu. Long wait for water and to place our order.
The waiter, once tableside, was irritating: \"You look like you've made an unpleasant choice,\"and \"Don't worry, I'm not judging you.\" WTH?

Disco music (yes, disco) competed with table conversation. Too loud, especially for such a small place.

Food, bleh. One of our party didn't get what he ordered. I didn't receive the condiments requested for the frozen, reheated fries. My grilled cheese was good, though, and on really good wheat bread.

Bottom line, don't go unless you're craving a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Pleasant dinner at io.  Food was simple but nicely prepared.  They have fancier dishes I would be up for trying. 

No wait but full house.  It was beautiful sitting by the widow. 

Only complaint is it was loud. They should add soft surfaces to dampen noise.  It made it hard to have a conversation unless you sat side by side."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients well prepared. Took my mother and sister (a pastry chef from LA) for a Saturday lunch. Both were impressed. Monster grilled cheese with the tomato basil soup can't be beat, and I won't be thinking about dinner until late tonight!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are the best in town.  Everything I've had here has been awesome, crab cake sandwich to some jambalaya."}
{"text":"This lovely little place sits in a little shopping area just a few minutes walk from my house....lucky me!  The restaurant itself is smallish, not cramped.   It's cute but not in a fussy way and has a very nice vibe.  The wait staff are friendly, knowledgeable and efficient--very enjoyable.  Overall, it's a very relaxing atmosphere.  The food is prepared well and presented in a simple but pleasing way.  They do a wonderful job of everything from cocktails to grilled cheese to the most succulent bronzzini ever.....
It's a great little place and I hope it never goes away!"}
{"text":"Delicious! After living in the south hills for many years, I finally had the pleasure of dining here for lunch with my father who was in from out of town.

I highly recommend the French mushroom soup and the roasted turkey BLT. The service, food and overall atmosphere were amazing!"}
{"text":"My BF and I came here last week for a celebration dinner.  I came here years ago and it was a BYO and the menu was much more expensive.  I had also had the best Tagine I have ever had back when it was Iovino's.  So I was surprised when we looked at the menu that things were under $20 and much more casual.  I guess they decided to revamp the menu when then changed from Iovinos to iO.  I had the braised beef chilli over a parmasean polenta, which was a special.  It was fantastic and super filling!  My BF had a burger which he said was cooked to his medium preference and good.  Our server was really nice, very attentive.  It wasn't busy for a Wednesday.  I'm glad they changed their set up to a more casual neighborhood eatery.  They do serve wine and beer now, but you still can BYO.  So moral of this story.....if you are avoiding this place because of the old expensive menu from its Iovino's days, its time to revisit iO."}
{"text":"Great service. Really cute place in a great location. I live right down the street. I decided to get a salad to go for dinner. I asked for no onions or olives with extra cheese. I got next to none. This salad isn't worth $12 but I'll try another time. Give this place a chance. Great atmosphere. Just look inside your bag before leaving with carry out."}
{"text":"Had a very nice meal at Io on Friday night. Although they don't take reservations and the restaurant was quite busy, I was seated within 15 minutes. The menu has many tempting options. I chose the  orecchiette with kale and sausage. A simple concept but I've never seen this combo together.  All items were perfectly cooked and complemented each other well. I definitely got there fresh ingrediant concept

There do seem to be some organizational issues however. I asked for no cheese, and my pasta was covered with Parmesan. Also, there are great sounding smoothies on the menu... 

Still, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Consistently ok food. I adore the fish tacos. Other meals I've had there are literally not memorable. It is a small, clean little place. The service I've had here has been pretty good on most occasions, but can be a little slow."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been better! Ordered the crispy green beans and a small (huge!) salad with crispy chicken. The chicken had incredible flavor and the salad was fresh and very generously portioned. The green bean appetizer is a must! The service was prompt and friendly. The atmosphere is casual enough for a brief lunch, but has an ambiance that would also make a nice night out for dinner. The quality of the food couldn't be better, but for the price the portions are also quite generous. I simply stopped in on my way traveling through town, but I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am fortunate enough to live within walking distance of this excellent restaurant. The food has always been excellent and the service is very good. The tempura tuna appetizer is delicious, and I've never failed to enjoy any of the entrees.

This is one of those rare restaurants where the food's flavors are well-layered and interesting without being clever or pretentious."}
{"text":"The quality of this food is top notch. Servers are responsive and intelligent.  They know the products and have great recommendations. Menu selections are scrumptious. Ambiance is excellent... precisely how a restaurant should be. I would recommend highly. Will go back immediately.  Make sure you try the shrimp with polenta... it's marvelous!!!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant for any occasion, large or small.  We had a party of 11 for a going away dinner and no one has anything bad to say about the food or service.  Several different dishes were ordered by all from salads to pasta to appetizers.  The mussels are to die for.  The pasta dishes that were ordered came just as described in the menu and were so tasty.  The staff was extremely attentive always having drinks refilled or asking if another alcoholic beverage was wanted/needed before it was dry.  The clean, open atmosphere made for a wonderful dining experience.  The location is also ideal with shops and stores all around."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch multiple times. The food is fantastic! The sweet potato fries are perfectly prepared. The sandwiches for lunch  have all been prepared fresh with high-quality ingredients.It has become increasingly busy and therefore it is also a bit noisy for conversation. It's fine for dining with two! It is metered parking in this area so I recommend taking the first spot you see!"}
{"text":"Iovino's is a great, little restaurant and a new addition to the strip of shops on Beverly Road.  The owner, Jeff Iovino, is a Mount Lebanon native and grew up in the neighborhood.  The food here is interesting and innovative, and focuses on local ingredients.  I had a PLT sandwich - shaved and deep-fried pieces of portobello mushroom, lettuce, and tomato, on perfectly toasted white bread and accompanied by sweet potato fries.  It is a delicious sandwich that I have craved every time I've been in Pittsburgh.

The space itself is very minimalist and therefore can get loud, I've heard.  I visited with four friends towards the end of their lunch hours and received excellent service.  I would highly recommend it for a quick bite to eat while completing shopping or banking on Beverly Road.  

My only gripe is the fact that they are closed Sundays and Mondays.  Since I am usually in town on weekends, this really limits my ability to visit.

However, the food was great and more than enough reason to set aside my minor gripe.  I hope to return soon and try more of Iovino's wonderful food."}
{"text":"the  food is terrible the cafeteria at school is better and they have green burgers purple chicken nuggets and blue hot dogs don't go here"}
{"text":"I was expecting a moderately good meal based on what others had told me, but I was incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal at Iovino's.

I had seared sea scallops with linguine and a porcini cream sauce.  The flavors were very well balanced and made for a great dinner.  The others in my party had a filet on mashed potatoes with a tasty sauce, a flank steak with mashed sweet potatoes, and pan seared fluke on quinoa.

The menu changes frequently, so check the website for the latest offerings.  I don't go to Pittsburgh very often, but I'll certainly be visiting Iovino's again."}
{"text":"I stop here once a month or so and I am usually happy with my selection. Today I got the grilled cheese and I'm sorry to say this is probably the worst grilled cheese I have ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times for dinner and it's just fantastic. The place itself is absolutely adorable, great for dates or friendly meetups. The menu is awesome, they have a wide variety of options. The staff has always been very friendly and attentive.

The aesthetic of the place gives you a \"classy\" vibe, but it's casual attire.

When you're done, you can head across the street to Scoops On Beverly for some fantastic ice cream and sorbet. Parking for either place can be a pain when it's busy, but there is plenty of street parking within 1-3 blocks away."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: cute little restaurant in a cute little strip in Mt. Lebanon. Serving variety of cuisines and dishes. Good food, but not the best you'll have. 

My husband and I came here on a Friday night and it was packed and we figured they have to be doing something right. Looking at the menu, it's hard to identify their signature dishes as their menu has quite the assortment of cuisines. They have grilled cheeses, pastas, fried rices, jambalaya, tacos....identity crisis or jack of all trades? The hubby ordered the Chicken Marsala and I ordered the Fish Tacos and French Onion soup. I thought my soup was ok; definitely have had better. The fish tacos were good, but again, I've still had better. They were huge though. However, the chicken marsala was delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly, as was the chicken. And the sauce! Perfectly sweet, savory and earthy, with hints of wine and garlic. So all in all, it was a hit and miss so we hope to be back to try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"Everything we've every had here has at least been good.  Sometimes it's been excellent.  The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable.  They have a pretty good beer list, though nothing on draft.  They also changed their menu up recently and eliminated some things, including my wife's favorite pasta dish.  They added a bunch of grilled cheese sandwich options which isn't really my thing.  Definitely recommend though, this restaurant would fit in down in more trendier spots like Lawrenceville, Shadyside or downtown."}
{"text":"What I liked: ,  my tenderloin salad was ok. Friend said burger was okay but too heavy on the Jalapenos. Service was fast!

What I did not like: it is always cold in there, summer winter, etc, not too close to door but still felt cold when anyone entered.  green bean appetizer was but a bit too greasy.The fries had an odd after taste, clearly were frozen at some point. My daughter's pasta was dry! There was not enough sauce to even touch all the noodles. She is shy and won't complain. So she ate very little. Service was disinterested, Ask if all was okay but not wait for answer. Never questioned why we left so much food untouched. $53 is a bit steep for such mediocrity"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I've never been screamed at by so many people before. I couldn't afford to pay a $1.50 tip and the waiters, waitresses and owner proceeded to scream at me, a 13 year old who has always tipped before.  Afterwards, they banned my mother and family from the establishment claiming that we stole from a girl's college tuition for not paying a tiny tip if $1.50. If it's that important, they should include the tip within the check as a service fee. My mother and I have never been treated so poorly by a restaurant where we knew the owners and servers. Think twice before ever going there again. I have never cried after a restaurant going experience. Also, I DIDN'T EVEN EAT. Those people have quite the nerve to yell at young girls scrapping their pennies together to pay for a meal. Never again will I eat there, And I suggest that nobody else does either."}
{"text":"It may or may not be fair for me to rate the restaurant since I never actually ate the food. We entered the restaurant and were seated at a table for four . The restaurant was 75 percent full. Very nice interior with upscale decorations. The problem was that it was so cacophonous a dining space, we could not stay. None of the 4 of us could communicate with one another over the tinny clatter. Unfortunately, one of the members of the party had ordered a martini. The same member  of the party decided he could not tolerate the noise. We rose to leave and informed the host. He informed us that we would have to pay for the ordered drink, whether we drink it or not. Fair enough. It was made. Those around the seemed to be enjoying their food. It looked appetizing. No matter how appetizing the food, it is of doubtful appeal  in such a cacophonous dining room. Unless you plan to visit on a slow night, be prepared for a jarring experience. Update- I increased my review to 3 stars. It's probably closer to three and a half. It is still jarringly loud in this restaurant. But I think the food,  the service, and the excellence of the cocktails make this place worth visiting"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. We were a party of four and we all liked what we ordered: shrimp with polenta, crab cake sandwich, portabello sandwich, and their daily catch, a scallop and linguini  dish. We all shared the fried green bean appetizer which was very good. Good food, reasonably priced. The service could have been a bit more attentive, but I would not rate it as bad service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"How did I not know this place exists for so long? Seriously, it's a 5 minute walk away from my house - HOW?

Cafe io may be my new favorite local spot to eat. It's cozy, it's comfortable - it's everything you want in a cafe with that little extra something that comes with a restaurant. The staff is great and the cooks specialize in well-done comfort food. Tomato soup, grilled cheese, burgers, those sorts of things, with daily and weekly specials that add a little extra flair to the menu and gives the adventurous folk some extra options. But really, comfort food's the way to go here: what's better on a Friday than eating your favorite soup or sandwich while sipping on a cocktail?

I personally highly recommend the hummus and vegetable plate, and the veggie sandwich was really yummy as well. My first visit was the day after Halloween so they still had a Pumpkin Pie martini that was wonderful, and I can't wait to see what other seasonal beverages this cafe may offer. Hopefully one of them goes with a crab cake sandwich, because that is next on my list of things to try!

Oh, and as if the food weren't enough of a reason to go, it looks like they often give donations to and do partnerships with local nonprofits. Comfort food that helps benefit a local cause - now really, how can you say no to that?"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now, and I've just never been disappointed. Everything they've made has been beyond delicious. I don't know how they do it. If you're in the neighborhood or even if you're not in the neighborhood it's absolutely worth it to stop by here. Awesome service too!!"}
{"text":"This is such a great little place, so much to love! They have delicious soups to start with (the ham and bean is yummy)! The salads are tasty and fresh, too.  A full bar, which is a nice surprise in such a little place. I love the fish tacos - they are really good and spicy!! I also have had a ribeye that was to die for. No complaints at all. I only wish they had more gluten-free options/vegetarian choices. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pgh-Style Crab Cake sandwich as take-out and it was packaged well and the time estimate provided was accurate. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"So happy I finally gave Cafe io a try!

Was in the Mount Lebo area for business and needed to grab a late lunch with some colleagues (~1pm).  After avoiding a potential chain-restaurant fiasco, we agreed to give io a go.

Simple, well-executed, darn good food.  I don't know how else to describe it.  My crab cake sandwich was fantastic (no significant filler, perfectly toasted bread) and my coworker's chicken BLT was apparently knock your socks off simple good.  I had debated ordering the fish tacos, and after seeing them come out to a few tables around us, I'll definitely be going back to give them a go!

The staff is well-attentive, and unlike a lot of the reviews, we managed to walk right in and grab a seat (likely due to the time of day).  While I was there, I also found out that they host monthly beer pairing dinners, which definitely has been added to my list of 10,000 other things to try!

If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and grab lunch here.  While I wouldn't give it a solid 5 (prices may be a little high for the suburbs...  just barely), I would say that this place just works....  can't really exlain it in any other way!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch.  Love the tomato soup, grilled cheese sandwiches, jambalaya  Only disappointment were the green beans.  Prepared perfectly, they were served with a horseradish dipping sauce that had almost no kick."}
{"text":"What a delightful place for lunch! The menu is vast and the selection is wide! Lots of great healthy selections and then lots of not so healthy. :-) I was excited to see the variety of soup options! I got the minestrone and Greek salad. Both were excellent! The soup was very pleasing on the eyes because off the veggies were fresh looking and flavor was perfect. The salad was delicious. The greens were beautiful visually and crisp! The grilled chicken was cooked perfectly! I loved every bite! The service there is okay, its not bad but definitely not amazing or I would have given 5 stars. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came to cafe io on a Saturday for late lunch. The place was pretty empty and we were allowed to seat ourselves. The decor is classy and welcoming, although the space is a little cramped. The bar is jammed into narrow hallway that leads to the kitchen. I would not want to sit there, but they made the best of the space they had. 

This place is expensive for a cafe-type lunch atmosphere, but I was expecting this. I hoped that the prices reflected a higher quality dining experience, but I was disappointed. I ordered the french mushroom soup to start. This soup was so close to being awesome, but employee incompetence ruined it. My soup was very nearly cold. The cheese on top was not melted, as I'm sure it's supposed to be, and the cool temperature was a surprise. The soup itself was actually very good, and I was starving so I started eating it anyway. By the time our server reappeared (much, much later), I had already eaten most of it so I decided not to complain.

My mom and I decided to split the fish tacos. Another disappointment. They were dry, flavorless, and cold--again. I just ate them anyway.  They had a sauce on them that I assume was supposed to add flavor but I couldn't taste it at all. The tacos also came with fries on top instead of on the side, which wasn't really clear on the menu. I wouldn't mind, except there were only 3-4 fries on each taco, so the sum total of fries was significantly less than if they were a real side dish. Bummer, because I was splitting with my mom and more food would have been better. Luckily, we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. My mom really liked them, but I wasn't impressed. They didn't have any seasoning on them. This is what my mom liked, because she generally doesn't care for sweet potato fries, but loves sweet potatoes. I was just not impressed with these unseasoned sticks of sweet potato. 

Overall, there was nothing terrible here, but I wasn't blown away by anything either, and the prices were too high. The cold food was probably due in part to the time of day (between lunch and dinner shifts), but I still don't excuse them for it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Cafe Io is our standby for comfort food. They don't take reservations which is a problem in the weekends. The food is consistently good."}
{"text":"This place is EXCELLENT.  I do not go five-star very often.  This is an unassuming, humble, little place on Beverly in Mt. Lebo that vastly exceeded my expectations.

Here is what I like:

1)  The setting is nice, classic, and cozy.  There is lots of glass at the front, admitting good, natural lighting.  The tables/chairs are efficiently spaced, so there is elbow room (not always the case in a smaller restaurant).  They have one of those \"air door\" things that really keeps the cold out in Winter, as guests walk in/out from outside.

2)  The FOOD is great.  I've had a steak, a crab-cake, two of their fancied-up grilled cheeses, entre salads, side salads, and homemade soups.  All of it has been fantastic.  The grilled-cheese with the BBQ on it is amazing, especially with the sweet-potato fries.

3)  Service is good and unobtrusive, matching the setting with efficient service that works.  Food prep. times are very reasonable.

This place makes a great date-night spot, and my lovely wife likes it, too.  Go and give these folks a try."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they wouldn't serve me the brisket cheese fries without the meat. Not accommodating for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Really? Silly good! All the food is great! Took family (3 little girls - 11, 9, and 6) and had awesome homemade everything. Great desserts and great beers! Services is top notch!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden treasure in the south hills. I love this place. The food is always excellent, the chefs do an amazing job, and the atmosphere is clean and welcoming. I've never had a bad meal here. 
The menu changes periodically, but they keep certain dishes on as standard. I'm always excited to try their different seafood dishes, and the Iovino's appetizer with sweet italian sausage, tomato, basil, and tempura mozzarella is to die for.
The homemade deserts are wonderful."}
{"text":"After a long hiatus, I decided to give Cafe IO another try. My first trip to Cafe IO left me hungry and disappointed. I ordered the city chicken knowing it was actually pork but was quite surprisd by the fact that it was served medium rare. I was not asked how I wanted my pork done and would never have ordered it medium rare. I only eat pork that is medium well to well. When I told my server this, I was told there is nothing they could do about it. Needless to say, I didn't go back for well over a year 

This time, I noticed that the menu had changed and the place had significantly increased in popularity. We arrived at 7:30 and were told we would have to wait a half an hour. After convincing my husband to stay and wait, we made our way to the back of the room to the bar which is quite small and crowded. NOTE: They are no longer BYOB. You can bring your own bottle of wine but there is a corkage fee. I believe it's $10. Within 15 minutes, we had a table. Th menu consisted of sandwiches, burgers, salads and homestyle favorites. I ordered the turkey with mashed potatoes with bacon on top. Delicious. My dinning companions ordered a variey of sanwhiches/burgers and really enjoyed their meals. For dessert, we shared the Ghiradelli chocolate brownie sundae. Chocolate decadence! 

Overall, I think that Cafe IO has made some significant improvements over the last two years. The menu is more appropriate for the location and clientele. The service is good and the drinks are reasonably priced. However, if you go on the weekend expect to wait 20+ minutes. They do not take reservations."}
{"text":"this is a wonderful neighborhood deli and my go to lunch spot. they have 4 soups every day and at least one vegetarian option - usually there are two. the tomato bisque is the best ive ever had and all the others are good too. they also make sandwiches to order and have home made sides ready to go. hands down better than the chains and always friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Cafe Io several times and it has always been great! The atmosphere here is warmly welcoming yet classy. I've brunch-ed with a girl friend here in jeans and a hoodie when we craved yummy grilled cheese as well as enjoyed a nice birthday dinner with some friends! The crispy green beans with the horseradish sauce is my favorite appetizer and the tomato hummus never fails to disappoint. They've a decent wine and cocktail selection. Today I was craving soup and the tomato bisque was just what I needed for the cold I was nursing today! I love that this place is one of the few that always has multiple vegetarian soup options, each of which have been pretty fabulous I must say. The spicy veg head is the loaded version of the \"plain Jane\" grilled cheese sandwich which I'd definitely recommend if you think you can handle the spicy kick is gives you with each bite. The hot Ham n Cheese Pretzel wich is also really good! 'Real' ham and great quality bread always makes a great sandwich. Cafe io has grown to become the \"trusty\" neighborhood restaurant that I love going back to whether by myself, or with a friend or even in group!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch at this cafe - great soup and salad. 

The space is well lit and there are lots of tables and even a few high tops. 

Parking is easy when you find a spot out front on Beverly!

I had the tomato basil soup, which was delicious. I would have loved a little more fresh basil on top. 

My salad was also good. 

In general, a nice spot for lunch and i definitely will plan to return and try out the BLT options on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great find! Not only is this close to home, right in the heart of Mt.Lebanon, it's an incredible little cafe!
Right across from bados on Beverly road, this little cafe is bright and open with great vibe inside.
The menu is incredible! A wide range of options from burgers to vegan dishes.
We started with drinks from the bar, an amaretto sour and a makers mark old fashioned, both were outstanding and for $7, a great value. Then we ordered the crispy green bean app, which if you get anything, get the beans!!! Then I had the angus burger with the minestrone soup, both were outstanding! My wife had the special which was a salmon BLT and sweet potato fries, very good, fresh and tasty. My son, the vegan, had a delicious veggie pasta with fresh mushrooms and gluten free pasta!
A great place, if you're in the south hills stop in and give it a shot!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and absolutely hit the spot. We were in the south hills visiting family and stopped in cafe IO on a whim while driving past on the way home. We each had trouble deciding what to get only bc there were so many different menu items that sounded delicious. The crispy green beans were a great starter with a rich and tangy horseradish sauce. My wife had the French mushroom soup and loved it. I had the chicken and sausage minestrone, loaded with veggies and meats and very tasty. For entrees she got the crab cake sandwich and I got the grouper special. She gets crab cake sandwiches basically everywhere but quickly deemed this one of her favorites. The crab cake itself was moist and booming with flavor and the crunchy sourdough toast was the perfect compliment. My grouper came grilled over jasmine rice with chopped celery and peppers in a spicy Cajun gumbo type sauce. The flakey fish was great with the crunchy vegetables and the sauce had the perfect amount of spice for me (but a little much for my wife's taste). We can't wait to go back and try the other things from the menu we wanted.  Well done cafe IO."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheeses in Pittsburgh. Love this place. I have eaten here 3 times & the food is always delicious. Highly recommend a grilled cheese with grilled onions on whole wheat with tomato soup. The grilled cheese has the perfect amount of cheese & bread (it's not greasy) & the tomato soup you can tell is made from scratch. 
Also, the fish tacos are awesome! 
Good service, the food comes out fast & good prices. You can't go wrong, Cafe io is a must try!"}
{"text":"Cafe Io is simply wonderful! It's quickly becoming my favorite weekend lunch spot in Lebo.  It's at a great location on Beverly Road in Lebo, and the service is superb! Let me also tell you that you must get the French Mushroom soup!! Think FO soup only way better. It comes with a little shaving of parm cheese on top that is the perfect amount.  I crave that, I want more. They also serve alcohol which is always a plus in my book. I've only been in for lunch twice so far, but I am really looking forward to trying other menu items!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, though not the best I've had. I wanted a steak and was near and it was rated well on Yelp.  Service was friendly and nicely attentive, I'll definitely return soon, great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Been here twice and look forward to going back soon. It's a hidden gem, for sure. On my first lunch-time visit I ordered the French Mushroom soup and a small caesar salad. Both were delicious, satisfying, and extremely reasonably priced. During my second dinner-time visit I got the Veggie Pattie Melt (sans bread) with sweet potato fries. I would have been happy with just the sweet potato fries, honestly. Next time I definitely want to venture into the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Love the green beans with the horseradish sauce as an appetizer. My friend always has the open faced turkey sandwich. I'm kind of partial to the crab cakes!
The owners are truly hardworking and so personable. I would highly recommend dinner and a Lemon Drop Martini!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so Mt Lebanon. Not very good service but you put up with it because of the casual boujee environment. Food is good though. Tofu appetizer and crab cakes are my favorite."}
{"text":"Probably our fave neighborhood joint.  Just great American food.  Love the grilled cheese, sweet potato fries, and fish tacos in particular.  I think my husband could live on the fish tacos... Never had a bad meal here.  DH had a steak special here the first time we went and he seemed to think he died and went to heaven (crab mashed potatoes were admittedly truly outstanding).  I like that there's a good mix of standards -- sandwiches, pasta, salads, meat.  Something for literally everyone.  Service is always polite and prompt. Prices are reasonable and we've never had trouble getting in.  They make a good dirty martini, which is always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Got Togo: cute little gem, very clean, service is great. Very personable. Food was good, 4 stars because I didn't get ketchup for my burger which I thought was strange. And the French mushroom soup lacked flavor. But nothing a little salt couldn't fix."}
{"text":"I just love Beverly road and all the spots up here. Came here the other day to meet a friend that works at Lincoln elementary. I didn't even get a picture of my salad because it was so delicious. 

I arrived around 11:50 and the place was almost completely empty, but by 12:15 the entire place was filled completely. We had a snug table in the back corner and got to catch up with our girlfriends.

The tomato soup and Greek chicken salad caught my eye today, and I'm so glad I tried them both. The tomato basil soup didn't even have any flour in it - yay for gluten free soup! The soup was comforting and warm on a chilly November day. Then I had the Greek chicken salad that was perfectly dressed with thinly sliced chicken.

It wasn't too filling but just perfect! I'd certainly come back here, but it didn't look they had gluten free bread for all the delicious sandwiches that they had."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and was really pleased. It's small and there isn't really a good waiting area without being in the way but were told we could snag a seat at the bar while we waited. There's only two seats at the bar but we didn't have a long wait so we just ordered drinks and chatted. Our waitress who also greeted us at the door and again at the bar was really sweet. They were pretty busy and because it's small the place seemed a little loud but it wasn't a deal breaker just can make dinner chat a little difficult. She did forget our appetizer but I have to chuck that up to either she didn't hear us order it or forgot because they were so busy, but no big, we got our food in a timely fashion and everything was good. I wouldn't put this in the mind blowing or delicious category but I'm also not complaining. It was a nice spot and the coffee shop across the street has later hours so it makes for a nice date night!"}
{"text":"Great food and service for a very reasonable price!!!! Love the atmosphere here!  I had the spicy veg head with sweet potato fries. Delicious!!!! Some of my favorite fries! I can't wait to go back and try the burgers!"}
{"text":"A cute little place with A+ food, you'd do well to make a reservation due to the cramped dining room. Luckily, we got a table with only a ten minute wait. The Crispy Green beans with their creamy horseradish sauce are a great app (it looks like everyone else ordered it too on Yelp). I had their Hot Ham N' Cheese Pretzelwich which is stuffed with thick cuts of country ham, gooey gouda, and has honey mustard on the side. The bun is a legit pretzel. Soooo damn good. Darren wanted to switch between halves so I got to try his Pittsburgh Crab Cake sandwich which was pretty good, even if I liked my pretzelwich better. For dessert it was the dreamy, fruity Limoncello cake. The ambience is very chatty. Our server Stephanie was a doll. I recommend dinner here since the food is good and offers something for everyone, including those on a budget."}
{"text":"Just the place to run and grab dinner when you don't feel like cooking. Friendly, neighborhood vibe, great service, good drinks, the fish tacos are delicious. Cozy and comfortable, never had a meal here that wasn't a pleasure from beginning to end."}
{"text":"What an excellent spot!  Fresh greens, delicious sandwiches and flavorful entrees makes this a must see when crusing through the south hills.  Although very small, their staff and kitchen really do it up big.  Cocktails are on point and the prices really can't be beat, especially for a spot in Mt. Lebo.  Lunch salads and grilled cheese are perfect during the day, really hard to beat..."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago for dinner with my fiance and parents.  We got there at around 7:30 and were seated immediately.  After quickly looking at the menu, we decided to start off our evening by sharing the crispy green beans.  They ended up being green beans coated in panko and came with a horseradish dipping sauce.  While the green beans were seasoned nicely and were very tasty, I was sad the the sauce that came with it did not have any kick to it at all and seemed to be more like a sour cream than a horseradish.  For my dinner entree I ended up ordering the tomato cream fettuccine which came topped with spinach and shrimp.  Whenever it came out I thought that the size of the pasta looked a bit small, especially for the price.  I did end up enjoying it though as the shrimp and pasta were cooked nicely while the sauce was fairly tasty.  I only wish that they would have given the table or me some bread to eat with the pasta.

The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  While nothing was bad about the place and the food was solid, nothing really blew me away.  Due to that I feel like I could have gotten better value for my food at many other places."}
{"text":"I tried this place after reading a review of them in the City Paper as a top restaurant in Pittsburgh. This place is perfect; a casual cafe/cozy room, albeit very tiny, but not so small that you are sitting right up on someone. There are no tables right next to each other (hate that awkwardness where you are practically sharing a table with another couple). Lots of cute shops on this street to browse in after lunch or dinner. 

The service is great, very professional, attentive, and down to earth. The food taste like it belongs in a 4 or 5 star restaurant, but its served in a cute little cafe. The food could easily be sold for 2 or 3 times the price if it were served in a bigger restaurant. Everything is home made, divine. 
Appetizer: try the fresh hummus and pickled veggies, never knew I liked pickled veggies! Best hamburger I've ever had.  Everything from fish tacos to steak to pasta. Great salads served with fried onions on top. A nice little bar, good martini selection. 

The amazing thing is the price. Most meals around 15$, great value and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pertect place to take you children. They have a huge selection of kid friendly items on the menu  (my six year old Son loves it there and do so I)   but the best part about Cafe Io is the grown up food. I recommend the chili and the chicken parm sandwich.  Both are hand made and both are awesome.  Every then me or and one with me has ordered there has been awesome."}
{"text":"I just love this place! The owners are super sweet and the restaurant has it's niche down! Their soups, salads, and sandwiches are always spot on. I haven't tried any of the entree options because I go there when I crave soup! They have a wide variety of choices and I have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. Love love love"}
{"text":"Cafe IO is a fantastic local restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. The brisket chili is phenomenal and the chicken is so perfectly cooked and juicy every time I visit. Even the food from the kids menu is better than most meals I would cook for an adult. It's simple but flavorful. The menu is a nice size. It's not too large and overwhelming and everything they offer is a great quality selection. I'm kind of obsessed with the strawberry shortcake right now. They also have a nice little bottle beer selection. This place is quality. Love it."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I have to get their spinach salad. The dressing, the goat cheese, the apples... they're all perfect. It's just filling enough. I have tried multiple appetizers and have enjoyed them all. My guests have tried their grilled cheeses, and have loved them. I'm fairly certain this is a BYOB restaurant. The only aspect I dislike is the children that will run around the restaurant freely during dinner hours, and sometimes at lunch hours. The ambiance is cozy and warm, and I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Good food, good staff, relaxed environment, lovely menu. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Went here one Friday night with a friend. It is trendy and was very busy. The restaurant is small inside with limited seating so I would highly recommend a reservation if they'll take it. Otherwise, I recommend getting there a little early. Parking was difficult in the area but there are a few small lots and street parking available. Our server was knowledgable and friendly. Service was quick. 

The crispy green bean app was very good and I would get it again. I also had a fish special which was available at the time and it was amazing. Everything I had was flavorful and cooked perfectly!I ate everything and loved it! 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Found this great caf√© on a whim while visiting. It had a fantastic atmosphere and I felt totally relaxed sipping my coffee. We ordered the tomato basil soup,  Monster Grilled Cheese and Spinach salad with chicken. The tomato soup tasted homemade with just the right consistency. The salad had an array of fruits that only enhanced the flavor! The monster grilled cheese was HUGE! The barbecue was perfectly balanced with the egg and veggies. I'm not sure who could finish all that and their soup, but I am looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Why have I never been here before?! A lovely place with excellent service and even better food. Huz and I ordered an appetizer and two entrees, which was a little bit too much food, but we were hungry and finished it all. Unfortunately, we didn't leave room for dessert so I can't comment on that. Everything about this place was great and I like to think that this is our new go to date spot."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food. My pasta dish was so-so, but everyone else's dinner was great! We had a very sweet, very good server. But, when I asked a passing server about adding another chair to our table, she rolled her eyes at me and made a very rude comment along the lines of \"where would you even put it?!\" I then had to move the chair myself. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Everything here was top notch. The waitstaff, the atmosphere and the food... all great. I'm concerned they don't have a bigger sign outside... how will the people know? My mom just asked me where she can take me to lunch on my birthday and Iovino's is where I picked. Hope this place makes it."}
{"text":"Just went there today for lunch as my friend had never been. Really great experience. The waitress was friendly and kept the hot water coming for our tea. I suggested the hot turkey sandwich because of a recommendation on Yelp. My friend and I both ordered it and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the Shrimp and Bay Scallop Linguine. Tastes Great BUT, I did Not Like that they left the Shelled Shrimp tails On.  Not a fan of picking through my Pasta to take the Shrimp Tail Shells off Before,  I eat the Pasta...."}
{"text":"My parents go here fairly often and really enjoy it.  They talk about it all the time.  We were in town for my Mom's birthday and it was her choice for dinner.  Service was very friendly and we all had very good meals.  It would have been a bit better if they had some noise dampeners - it was very loud and difficult to have a conversation (especially with a person that was hard of hearing).  Looked like they had dampeners on the ceiling but they were painted over to match the walls, which I believe eliminated their dampening ability.  Overall, a nice place with good food.  Will definitely return if in the area, but I know the 'rents will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very less than memorable, had high expectations for this newer restaurant on Beverly Road. Unfriendly service and the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot on Beverly Rd. The tomato bisque was so flavorful and comforting on a cold day. The Portobello mushroom sanwhich tasted healthy - lots of veggies. I experienced good service during lunch in a sunny nook by the window."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Got the crab cake sandwich with sweet potato fries and mushroom soup along with green bean fries for a started. Everything was awesome. The sandwich had a ton of crab and the mushroom broth was delicious and homemade."}
{"text":"It is a small gem in Mt. Lebanon! The food is unique and the prices are great. I had the smoked pork and shrimp fried rice it was amazing! The waitress said that they smoke their own meats in house! I know I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cafe IO is one is my favorite places to go to in Mt. Lebanon! The food is always consistent, no matter if I eat in or take out. The food is mostly of homemade quality, fresh and always consistent. The entire staff is always super friendly. I really like their crab cakes, sweet potato fries and their soups are all homemade and delicious. Their salads always contain the freshest ingredients and are filling and delicious. The only con is in the winter, the draft of the front door can hit you if you're sitting at a table along the isle. I love visiting Cafe IO! Thanks for the yummy food, Cafe IO!"}
{"text":"Note: Strongly consider making a reservation due the Cafe Io's popularity and diminutive dining room to avoid enduring a wait (15 minutes) as we did. 

Along a short but lively business district along Mt. Lebanon's Beverly Road exists a compact (cramped?) restaurant that shares its name with a priestess from Greek myth, a moon of the planet Jupiter, a programming language, and a genus of freshwater snail among other things. In actuality, Cafe Io is named after its proprietor, Jeff Iovino, who revamped and rechristened his own restaurant, streamlining the name as well as the menu. 

A strikingly simple logo of almost glowing letters seemingly carved into grey gunmetal ingot is the only prominent feature of the restaurant's exterior. Inside, framed, generic paintings hang from bare, alabaster walls. The mundane sparseness of the decor, however, belies an interesting and eclectic menu that isn't shy of serving upmarket takes on burgers, sandwiches, and diner fare (Open-faced Turkey and Gravy anyone?) alongside maki, Orecchiette, and Jambalaya. 

Sandwiches, however, were what our stomachs and wallets (they tend to run a little cheaper than the entrees) told us to go with, the gastro-financial zeitgeist putting us on a path where the familiar and homey are dressed-up for an elegant night of gadabout mischief. 

Like a number of other reviewers, we (well Kay, my boss, to be honest) found the Crispy Green Beans hard to dismiss as an appetizer. The horseradish-laden, sour cream (?) based sauce could have gone well with any finger food, and the battered ejotes played the part of Everystarter and condiment vehicle (in these instances, we all know what the main attraction is here, folks) superbly, leaving us wanting a little more, as all first courses should. 

Kay ordered the Hot Ham 'n Cheese Pretzel Which while I took on the Pittsburgh Style Crab Cake Sandwich. Envy and curiosity compelled us to switch plates after we consumed exactly half of each. 

A full-bodied crab cake with a minute amount of filler made up the bulk of my aristocratic Primanti's-inspired classic. Toasted sourdough escorted it out of the Rolls Royce as a Napa cabbage slaw, a citrus aioli, and astonishingly crisp (aged?) tater shards kept it grounded thoroughly in the Steel City. As I reveled in every bite, I couldn't help but wonder how much fun its creator had as he conceived it. This was a jazz musician sneaking a Jimmy Page riff into a performance for the guy in the back who looks bored. 

Eyeing up Kay's sandwich and longing to redeem myself for being tricked into the Redhead's latest marketing ploy, we enacted our plan, our pact if you will, neither of us regretting it one ounce. The Pretzel Which's bun was an 100% authentic pretzel complete with the required brackishness and chew factor. Contained within it were egregiously thick cuts of country ham, a drape of gouda, and a fantastic, housemade honey mustard.

A dandy Caesar Salad punctuated by a exemplary creamed, tart dressing seconded my sandwich. 

Yet another astonishing incarnation of that dessert I continue to be infatuated with finished my end of dinner: A Fudge Brownie Sundae. Permeated and garnished with Ghirardelli chocolate as well as caramel, vanilla ice cream, and pecans, every morsel was a step into hell, and like the AC/DC song, it wasn't a bad place to be. Moisture met hardness, heat rubbed against cold, evil reconciled with the divine. 

Topped off by a very genial, accommodating clientele (a fellow diner alerted a server to a recently vacated table next to her once she spotted us waiting near the entrance for seating) and a cool, capable, canny cutie of a server named Stephanie (we loved ya!)  with whom we couldn't stop gabbing, Cafe Io is the type of restaurant that makes the South Hills, and Mt. Lebanon in particular, unsung hero of a community that it is. Shadyside, eat your artichoke hearts out. 

P.S. Some people apparently had issues with the noise level, but we barely minded it. To us, it was merely chatty (the tables are close together, thus one can hear everyone's conversations, which were not unpleasant to eavesdrop on) and never strident. It's not as if the latest Lamb of God album was blaring at 11, and you know I probably wouldn't have been put off by that. \m/

Go, go, Cafe Io."}
{"text":"Stopped in a Friday to have some seafood and the meal was great.  Everything on the menu seems to be tasty and well thought out and prepared.  The Mediterranean Bronzini on a parmesan polenta was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  Of course SWMBO ordered the crispy Green Beans to start, that are so much fun to eat.  
As always, the service was good."}
{"text":"Food is pretty simple. I had a crab cake sandwich with sweet potato fries. Both were good, nothing outstanding though"}
{"text":"This is a cozy place, with good food and reasonable prices. I have visited twice so far. There is one thing that I find perplexing: inflexibility. I asked for the fish tacos without onion, and the waitress said no. When the dish arrived, there were a few raw onions on top, and I just plucked them off. It wasnt like they were mixed in and impossible to remove. On a second  visit, i asked if I could substiture rice for fries with the fish tacos, an option that was available on all other sandwiches. When i asked why, the waitress said \"no\". Why? \"Because that is an entree\". I offered to pay extra. Still no.  For an  otherwise lovely place, this seems kind of \"soup Nazi\" to me, espcially when there are so many options in Mt Lebanon."}
{"text":"Cafe io is the reason to visit the Beverly shopping district.  A nice menu selection and a very sizable kids menu (for a change).  The food is fresh and tasty.  The price to portion ratio is about right for a restaurant of this type.  No one in my party left hungry nor did we fell like we were overcharged for what we were served (unlike how I felt when left Block 529 a few weeks ago).  Io is not a weekly stop for us, but when we do stop in for a meal, the time away makes the food that much better."}
{"text":"For as much as people rave about this place, I thought it was okay. I ordered scallops with asparagus and the Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese noodles were not al dente which in my opinion is a bad mistake. The scallops were good but the asparagus was watery. My boyfriend had the Thai butternut squash soup which he really liked. He also got the mushroom Swiss burger and he was not impressed. The burger was dry and the onions were not caramelized; they were just cooked onions. Additionally, we did not particularly like the atmosphere. We sat at one of the high tops in the back and it felt like we were in a high traffic area. I will say there were a couple of families there with small children and it is nice that they are accommodating in that way. We will definitely give this place another try at some point. I am interested in their brunch."}
{"text":"This place was so warm and welcoming on a cold and dreary fall day. I love walking into a place that feels cozy and intimate, with a small staff and lots of personal touches - and that's exactly what happened here. I was meeting a colleague for dinner on a weeknight after a very long day of travel (and dealing with Pittsburgh's never-ending terrible traffic). I found this place thanks to Yelpies and invited him to meet me here.

As I arrived early, I sat at the tiny little bar and ordered a cocktail. Holy. Cow. I can't remember the name, but I'll never forget the flavors of the gin martini with grapefruit and lemon juices and agave nectar. I knew I was off to a good start. When my colleague arrived, we were immediately seated. I ordered the orecchiette and he a burger. We were both very impressed with both the timeliness and flavor of the dishes. My pasta had the exact right amount of sauce, sausage, and veggies to make each bite perfection. We ended the meal with dessert drinks, and I have decided to start making the Nuts n Berries drink myself at home, it was so dreamy.

It pains me to say that I had one sad experience when I took some dessert to-go. While the substance of the berry/custard pie(?) should have been spot on, it was so dry that it crumbled each time I went for a bite. Either the dessert had been sitting awhile or there isn't enough moisture in the custard to keep this cohesive. I'm guessing that the former is the case.

All in all, I would really recommend this place for a casual but impressive dinner."}
{"text":"Nice place. Interesting and good menu. Surprisingly reasonable priced. 
Very helpful hostess staff while waiting for a table. 
We went over to Bedo's to have some drinks and they called us when our table was ready. 
That was awesome. 
Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Very nice little cafe in the middle of mount leb. Lots of locals and kids were there; nice atmosphere when we went for lunch around 1. I had the crispy fish tacos which were amazing. I ate the whole meal! They were light and crunchy and had a tangy kinda sauce. The staff was nice and all around I had a very good experience for a quick lunch. Exactly what I wanted. 

My boyfriend had the angus burger and added bacon he said it was pretty good and I could tell because he finished everything on his plate."}
{"text":"Cafe Io sits in the middle of part of the business district on Beverly Road. They also have a small cafe next door for takeout purposes. I arrived at the restaurant shortly after it opened and could virtually sit anywhere I wanted.

Within a matter of half an hour the place was nearly packed with people. They have an extensive menu. Two prominent choices on their menu include their tomato bisque soup which is very good and a selection of various types of grilled cheese sandwiches. I later learned from my waiter that their fish tacos are also popular.

I decided to stick with a spinach salad with cranberries and goat cheese. For a small uncharge I was able to have garlic shrimp added to my salad. I got my salad in no time. It wasn't altogether huge but was delicious. The shrimp was very flavorful-you get 4 added into the salad. My waiter was very friendly and attentive to my needs.

Hopefully when I return I will try the fish tacos. The only downside in this area is that there is limited metered parking and I just learned that they are currently building two other restaurants in this same complex. 

It is my hope that they will expand parking so that it will be easier to get to. The place is small and as I noted they do fill up very quickly. Unless you plan to get dessert elsewhere I'd recommend go with the soup and your main course. They do have other soups if you are not a fan of tomato bisque and they also have a soup of the day."}
{"text":"A must every time we visit family. Who knew a grilled cheese could be this good. Had the monster this time, I will order the egg over medium next time, because the only way it would be possible for it to be better would be for egg yolk running all over the place!  The beef brisket chili is some of the best chili I've ever tasted. Hadn't been in over 18 months and it's still ever bit as good."}
{"text":"My visit to Cafe io it's a perfect example of why I love Yelp. With dozens of reviews, and a solid 4 stars, I decided to venture to this place to give it a try. And I was completely blown away by the amazing food, exceptional service, and homey feel of this little restaurant.

Let's start off with the exceptional service. I like how it wasn't just our waitress waiting on us (filling our drinks and serving our food to us). Everyone on the service team pitched in and provided service. That quality of customer service makes me really happy!

Now on to the food. Wow. That's all I can say. I had the French Mushroom Soup and the Chicken Marsala for my dinner. The flavor of the soup is something I cannot explain and I highly recommend giving it a try! The Chicken Marsala rocked my world! I think it is the Marsala sauce that made the dish. It was a perfect combination of sweet and savory. It was so good I had to steal my companion's french fries to pick up the leftover sauce on the plate!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place, but it has been very inconsistent in terms of the quality of food. I've had great burgers and I've had some undercooked. Some nights the turkey tastes fresh and others it doesn't. The salads have been mostly good. The service is always very friendly. The inconsistency in the food though is slowly pushing me away."}
{"text":"It's a shame we haven't visited Cafe IO sooner, being just a hop, skip and jump away in Dormont. I blame those darn hills, or I'd be walking here! It's incredibly adorable inside, and we were lucky enough to sit in the best seat for date night, a cozy little set-up right in the corner by the window. 

I started off with a delicious manhattan, which makes me wish they had a bigger bar area to grab some casual cocktails at with friends. But I'm okay sticking with a dinner cocktail for now. 

We started with the Lovino ($10 - tempura mozzarella, Italian sweet sausage, marinated tomatoes, basil, organic mixed greens). You can't deny the power of tempura mozzarella. I kept repeating how much I enjoyed the balsamic too. Probably too much actually, much to the chagrin of my hubby. 

Next I had the Mediterranean Bronzini ($22 - grilled fillet of Bronzini, crispy parmesan polenta, wilted spinach, marinated tomatoes, balsamic
vinegar, extra virgin olive oil). Good thing it also had the balsamic on there so I could rave some more! There were two large pieces of fish too, so it was hard to finish the whole dish. Plus, the two fried polenta pieces gave it just the right amount of carby goodness that I craved.

I'll note that they have a large grilled cheese menu, which makes me want to come back again for lunch and also brings out the families for dinner. So know you can bring the kiddos!"}
