{"text":"24 hour coffee, free internet, lots of seating. What is there not to love?

During exam time the place gets very crowded with students revising, but otherwise you are guaranteed a seat for your morning coffee, pre-clubbing energy boost or just a hangout while waiting for someone.

Their filter coffee comes in more than five canisters, each with a different flavor. This is Heaven, as usually the house blend filter brew in other coffee shops is nothing short of vile. Some coffee joints seem to scream \"here's crap coffee for poor people!\". Thankfully this Depot hasn't adopted such tactics. 

I like my coffee to be Chuck Norris, therefore I love their darkest Italian roast and regularly get it.

I am sad to report their cannoli aren't up to scratch. A cannolo's filling should be heavy and filling ricotta goodness. The ones I tasted were filled with either whipped cream or a ricotta that must have seen the inside of a bike pump.

However, as we are over 4000 miles from Palermo I can't complain too much. Their coffee rocks, their staff is friendly and their Wifi is free. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Like the outdoor seating, however the indoor environment is pretty messy and crowded. They have very good service and their hot chocolate is amazing, made with hot milk and real chocolate."}
{"text":"Originally I wanted to check out Juliette et Chocolate, but after checking out their desserts, I was more in the mood for a laid back place with laid back desserts. So I headed across the street to Cafe Depot where a live 2 person band was enticing me to eat there.

We ordered some dessert, grabbed a table and chatted over the calming tunes. There is free wifi (didn't access it) and plenty of seating, including some soft chairs in the back. Most of the people there had their laptops on and were sipping on cups of Joe.

We didn't need any caffeine to keep us up at night so we opted for:

-gateau roche noir ($2.75): slice of hazelnut and chocolate cake. It was okay.
-gateau choco-brownie (~$4): a one inch thick slice of rich chocolaty goodness. Nothing else to say.

If I lived near this place in Montreal, you'd definitely see me hanging out here."}
{"text":"Café Depot is two streets west of Carre St. Louis, and a pleasant stroll even on a 90+ day in Montreal.  After exploring the wonderful Square and the surround neighborhood, we stopped in to cool down and have something refreshing. As with all services in the City, we were greeted with, \"Bonjour.\"  As soon as I responded with, \"Bonjour. How are you?\" they slipped seamlessly into Anglais for the rest of the interaction.  
It was just too hot for anything caffeinated, so we had 2 fruit frappes (smoothies).  I watched the barista dump a pile of fresh fruit and yogurt into the blender, along with some kind of pre-made mix.  After the whir and pour we had  large cold drinks in plastic cups to enjoy.  
They were cold, all right! Enough for brainfreeze. But, whatever was in the mix had too much sugar (probably not natural), and it made the drink just way over the line in sweetness.  I drank about a third of it for hydration, but left the rest behind.  If there be a next time, I would ask for something with just fruit and yogurt, without anything additional.  
I watched others gulp these down without complaint, so I guess it was just us.  
Still, a cool place with plenty of seating in and outdoors, and free wifi."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop with little cafe tables and couches. Very friendly staff. Sesame bagel with cream cheese (lots of cheese) was delicious."}
{"text":"sirr sirr sirrr please chill the eff out.  I asked for 3 black coffees and a cappuccino .  I'm sorry you can't speak english and pardon that i can't speak french.  

The guy at the counter was flipping out cuz he thought we asked for a 3 coffess and a chocolate drink.  When we repeated we wanted a cappuccino, he still didn't understand and started raising his voice blaring out his french.  We just looked at each other and then we looked at him while he was going nuts.  HAHAHA

We just ended up with 4 black coffees and he was still mad. LOL"}
{"text":"Their latte is so not the way I like it. Too much foam.
But their chicken wrap tasted great. 

Three washroom stalls - one without a lock, one broken. For such a huge cafe, they should immediately fix them (otherwise that washroom's going to end up looking as dirty as the Second Cup one on McGill College). I don't know about the men's washroom obviously.

More than enough seats. Never saw this place nowhere near full. I've only seen the place during the winter. Maybe it'll get full once summer comes along."}
{"text":"Ce Café Dépôt n'est plus 24h. Il ouvre à 6am le matin, le seul d'ailleurs dans les alentours. Choix de wraps/salades + viennoiseries et bien sûr cafés/expresso/thés. Wifi gratuit. De plus, les toilettes ne sont pas toujours propres, plutôt dégeulasses à vrai dire, le proprio devrait penser à rénover. Avec votre carte fidélité Café Dépôt, votre 7ème café est ''gratuit'' ."}
{"text":"Swung by the Cafe Depot to grab a coffee before exploring the streets of Montreal. While ordering, the barista was friendly by smiling while taking our order and it looked as though he was happy to be there.

Ordered our coffee and found a table to sit down. They have free wi-fi which was nice. But the thing that turned me off was that it was pretty dirty. There were old dishes from customers who have left, still on the tables. It was considerably slow at the time and you'd think that the staff would clean up the place.

We then sat outside because it was a nice day. But then you have the smokers outside so I wasn't happy about that either.

It the place was cleaner, it would have been a-ok."}
