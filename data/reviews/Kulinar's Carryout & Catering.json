{"text":"Yum! I've been looking for a place to replace my beloved Dubrovnik Garden since last time it just wasn't good anymore, and this place did the trick!! I had the cabbage roll dinner and YUMMM! So good, and the place was spotless inside. The two women working were kind and friendly. I hope more people check this place out so it sticks around!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing fast friendly service, huge portions and great prices!  Ordered the house platter, i was told they were out of sausage which was kinda disappointing but they added another piece of meat in its place. The meal came with a small salad, homemade bread (delicious) and i choose the home fries for my potato which were good but alittle one the oilly and salty side. The paris schnitzel and Winer schnitzel was cooked to perfection well seasoned and nicely crispy.  I will definitely be frequenting them for lunch now that i work close by.  

Thanks so much for the great meal and swrvice!!"}

{"text":"Best home cooking. Been eating here since I was little. Everytime we are in the area on Saturday w get the roast pork special, sometimes we make the trip from Lakewood just for it."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner from Kulinar's. I'm assuming it was the owner - he was so friendly. The food was ready quick and we really enjoyed it. The place also looked very clean and organized. We look forward to going back! They have a website that has their menu and some specials. It is a great deal the portions were good sizes. Just to be clear, it is a take out place not a restaurant."}
