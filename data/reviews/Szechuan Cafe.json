{"text":"Great food. Large selection of foods that I never even heard of but when I tried it, well I'm a big fan. Their Wonton soup is the best. The restaurant is clean and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"i order three dishes ?cold  noodle  ? spicy chicken and fish  .the noodle and fish tastes is strange.and price is very expensive ."}
{"text":"As someone from Sichuan, the food satisfied my standard for Sichuan food! I think it is the best in town. 
??????????????"}
{"text":"Love it! Best szechuan food in town! Very authentic! Forgot to take picture till we finished all food!"}
{"text":"Wow...great portions i will be back...
Fried dumpling
Orange chicken 
Szechuan pork

{"text":"Original Chinese Chinese Food, good taste. Good service. Better than some Sichuan restaurants in Shanghai."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since it is open. I am a big fan of Szechuan food. And this one is very authentic."}
{"text":"So convinced?why this restaurant has five stars review.  Food is so horrible. dont want come back."}
{"text":"This is simply one of the best Chinese restaurants in Cleveland in my opinion.  Located in the back of Asia Plaza (behind Li Wah), it's worth the effort to track it down.

All the food is awesome - some of the best flavors I've ever tasted, hot, fresh and quality ingredients.  While I mostly eat lunch here during the week, I've come up over the weekend for their hot pots and they are a ton of fun and very tasty.

Couple items of note - as others have said, don't feel put off if the place seems empty.  They do a ton of takeout and from my experience the food never suffers based on how many people are in the place.  Also as mentioned, the service staff can get a bit distracted here and there - but they are super nice folks and always willing to help.  If you need something just give them a wave.

Make sure to give this place a try if you love Chinese food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm torn, because I now have not one but two incredible Sichuan restaurants to choose from in Cleveland. Szechuan Café opened earlier this year in the former E. 30th St Café space inside Asia Plaza, but I only recently became aware of them when I sampled some of their food at the Night Market a month or so ago. Encouraged by the food we tried there, we visited Szechuan Café for the first time about a half-hour before close for take-out.


The woman who took our order was very helpful in assisting us in choosing dishes from the extremely extensive menu containing many unfamiliar options. She clearly had full command of all the dishes and easily explained them and gave us some recommendations. In contrast to some other restaurants in the area -ahem wonton gourmet ahem- I never felt like I was being treated as if my pasty white skin were a disadvantage. Despite the fact that it was near closing, she also insisted we sit down and enjoy some tea while we waited the scant few minutes until our order was ready. I don't know what the previous reviewer was talking about - this was some of the best and friendliest service I've received anywhere in Asia town.


I ordered mapo tofu as did one of my companions, another ordered the twice-cooked pork, and the final member of our party ordered the pork like mein, spring roll, and corn egg drop soup. I also ordered some dumplings in chili oil. All the food we received was delicious, fragrant, spicy, and in portions large enough for two meals each. The mapo tofu was probably the best I've had to date, with plenty of mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns to tame the heat. I like the fact that they offer a full American-style menu alongside their more authentic items - not everyone I tend to dine with is as excited by hot and numbing Sichuan food as I am. These items were also much more flavorful and enjoyable than most American-style takeout noodles I've had.


I feel like we've just scratched the surface of all the delicious treasures that come out of the kitchen at Szechuan Café, but I'm eager to start exploring. I still love Szechuan Gourmet down the street (for their lamb skewers especially) but at the very least they've got real competition now!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in the restaurant was empty. 
I was a little nervous to stay and almost left. 
I am glad I did not!!!
The food here is interesting and filed with flavors I never tasted. 
The menu is a bit large but focus on the Szechuan specialties and have a journey dining experience you'll never forget. 
I started with the a cold Diced Rabbit appetizer and then had the Big Plate Chicken in Chili Oil. 
AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and very fresh better than most Chinese restaurants even in NYC. Lots of vegetarian options too. The Service depends on your luck we got good service some people had to wait for special requests like extra vinegar. The restaurant is also very clean. Will come back."}
{"text":"Really great food of many Asian varieties! Chinese to Thai to Japanese. A little bit OVER seasoned, they seem to love ginger root. not my cup of tea. However, the food we ordered was hot and fresh, authentic and tasty. 

REALLY expensive for Chinese food though, and the location isnt ideal. The servers barely speak english, which was aggravating, but eh you win some you lose some.

I probably wont be back just because it really didnt WOW me, im an \"american chinese\" food lover, the authentic stuff was a little too much for me. BUt if youre in the area and can handle some ginger root by all means enjoY!"}
{"text":"Good service. Authentic Sichuan. They claim no MSG.  If you are super sensitive to MSG,  make sure ask not to add any flavor enhancements such as Ji Jing,  aka. chicken essence, which contains large amount of msg.  Dishes w/o it just taste so much fresher and you can actually taste each of the ingredients. And no more feeling extra thirsty. The kidney dish is my favorite so far."}
{"text":"First the bad news.... the Yelp $3.00 off your order was not honored. We asked and they said we could get free soft drink or 10% off only if we paid cash. I paid cash and the bill was not discounted until I questioned why and reminded them they made the offer. Hopefully they are not doing something shady. 
The good news is the food tests authentic. I've spent many years living in Asia and would say this place is much better than most American Chinese restaurants. When I travel thru Cleveland I usually try to have a meal here. I've probably had about a dozen meals here and never a bad tasting meal. The only reason for not giving a higher rating this time is because of what I mentioned in the first part of my review. They should pull the offer if they are not going to honor it."}
{"text":"Terrible service ! Food bland ! I would never go back to this place ! Best thing was the water and broccoli."}
{"text":"Delicious food and large portions. Front desk were very friendly when I picked up my order."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for authentic szechuan food so far. I really like the Spicy Chiken and Sliced Beef and Ox Tongue in Chilli Sauce. Want to have them everyday :)
The location is great, I always come here to eat after shopping groceries in Chinese supermarket. And the service is great! I like the free Chinese tea."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and friendly service. Visited this location for lunch with my father who eats there often. Wait staff greeted him by name which pleased him and they were extremely friendly during our meal. Food was delivered quickly to our table after we placed our order and tasted great. Portions are very large and quality is great...food is priced really well. Definitely recommend trying this location if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Szechuan restaurant! Szechuan Café has a wide selection of authentic and delicious Szechuan dishes prepared by an award-winning chef from Sichuan, China. The staff is also very knowledgeable and friendly, and are happy to answer any questions or recommend dishes. This is definitely a place to check out if you like Szechuan food, and even more so if you're looking for a great place to try it for the first time. They also offer some good American Chinese dishes to provide something for everyone, so bring your friends!"}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Service and the people are some of the rudest people I have ever met. They suck. And this is coming from someone who eats at all the crappy little hole in the wall places. 

Want chinese? Go to Wonton, or Szechuan Gourmet.  Foods good, and the service is nicer. 

This place probably spits in everyone's food.  Shady as hell.
Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Lots of food options, though have only gotten MaPo Tofu for pickup once thus far. Ordered online fairly painlessly with food ready during predicted pickup time.
Food itself was good: not exceedingly spicy,  but still flavorful. Will probably back in near future to see what other things I may like (especially on Sundays with other places closed).!"}
{"text":"Chicken has many little bone pieces . Be careful. Taste is ok, it is not good as it should be."}
{"text":"Terrible. Second time I went where they forgot my meal. Wound up taking it too go. Then the waitress was giving me a look because no tip. Why would I?!? You forgot my food!!  Never again."}
{"text":"The Szechuan green beans were fantastic!!! We also orderd  dim sum, very limited selection as it come from the kitchen not the cart but  was yummy.  BYOB as they don't have a liquor license.  Will  be back to try more dishes soon."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday night and the place was pretty dead.  Ordered some Chinese beers, but they were out, so we had Corona (super weird drinking corona at a Chinese place).  Ordered a bunch of dishes and took most home.  The tofu in chili oil was great.  The husband had the sichuan fish and loved it.  We also had the shredded spicy potatoes which were good, but I prefer Siam's version better.  Also ordered the ho fun noodles which were tasty.  Man, we ordered way too much food.  Their portions are huge.  They had to give us a box for the take home food.  Solid food, we'll be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Chinese cuisine, this is not the place to go! Do not go here if you are Chinese. They serve Americanized Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Well, this was a bit overwhelming.  The food here is decent, yes, but the problem I had was that there were so many things on this restaurant's menu that it was hard for me to pick out what was good and what was not, or even what was Szechuan-style cuisine and what was not.  

There were over 250 items on this restaurant's menu, including things that were definitely not Szechuanese dishes - Taiwanese stir fried noodles, sushi and Thai iced tea, to mention a few.  And when we asked the server to recommend something to us, she did not seem to know what to recommend herself.  We ended up ordering a griddle-cooked beef dish and a noodle stir fry, both of which tasted fine, pretty authentically Chinese, but I cannot say that for sure that it was authentic Szechuanese food.

I would recommend that you bring your Szechuanese friend to this restaurant and have him order for you."}
{"text":"We are from Fort Worth Texas and this was our first time at this restaurant.  The food was authentic, excellent tasting and the service was phenomenal.  Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"First time in. Great szechuan food. Ordered cucumber salad which is nice and refreshing compliment to szechuan food. The szechuan delight is spicy, szechuan peppercorn full of different surprizes. Yummy. The mapo tofu is delicious with spicy. 

Definitely will come.back again."}
{"text":"Truly the worst Asian meal of my life, bar none. Dried pepper chicken struck two notes: grease and heat. Dining room? Sterile, character-less and a greasy floor. The hallway between the dining room and the bathroom reminded me of the scene from Blade Runner where the replicants harass the guy who makes eyes. How the health department gives these guys a pass is beyond my understanding.  

There are much better choices in Asiatown."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in Asia Plaza. It is clean and price is very reasonable. We enjoyed the Mao Cai Delight. Recommended."}
{"text":"Wow. I thought I was kidnapped by Guy Fieri because we ended up in flavor town. The complex flavors of these seemingly simple dishes was amazing. Egg with tomato...sounds simple but do yourself a favor and order it. The cold lung appetizer sounds off putting but it's really good. The duck with chili and peppers (7 step duck?) was one of the best duck dishes I've ever had.  If it's empty when you show up don't worry.  We were the only table on a Sunday and they still crushed it. They are plenty busy with takeout orders so it's not like people aren't back there cooking.  Big thanks to my buddy for showing me this place."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese takeouts I have tried downtown. This is the third time I have ordered from here and have enjoyed each experience. The menu offers a variety of options, but the classic chicken fried rice is phenomenal. This is not your typical food that is high in salt. If you choose to dine in, there is a high pitched buzzing loose that can be very off putting."}
{"text":"Service is quick. Restaurant is new and clean. Food is tasty. Fuqi feipian (????), Shui Zhu Yu, and Ba Zi Ji are all very good! Portions are large."}
{"text":"More authentic than any most places I've ever been. The prices are affordable, and you get a decent amount of food. The only real negative I can say is that unless you speak Mandarin, there's probably going to be a language barrier. They do speak English, but if you have different requests or questions, you might be at an impasse. 
But, if you order off the menu you should be good."}
{"text":"I will continue to visit Szechuan Cafe based on the ladies working there alone. They are a fun group of gals! I was on a long half marathon walk/urban hike through the concrete jungle and stopped in for a Easter lunch. They remembered me from my visit a few days prior. I was immediately complimented on my retro Brooks running shoes. The server exclaimed \"Those are pretty shoes!\" and I felt great about them. I try not to be pretty. I try to be fly. One in the same. The Mapo Tofu and Spicy Slice Fish dish were both great. My ace boon coon had a fish soup packed with the little szechuan peppercorn flavor crystals and those things take your mouth on a journey. I eagerly await my next visit. I hope I get complimented again. It feels great."}
{"text":"Not authentic Chinese food at all!!! Worst waitress! The waitress literally was staring at us all the time and kept talking to us. Not Szchuan food at all! When we ordered our food, we told the waitress that we were from Szchuan and she told us that their chef was from Szchuan and wouldn't make it Americanized.  However, when we got our food and told them that it was not authentic at all, the waitress said to us that we did not order the right food. Literally, worst attitude for a waitress. Do not choose this restaurant if you want to try authentic Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Went last night and had a memorably good meal. We order crab Rangoon everywhere we go and this was the best we've had. My family enjoys dinner at Li Wah but we wanted something different for my daughter's birthday. The chandelier wasn't as stunning but the dining room was more comfortable and quieter. 

I was taking my 15 year old daughter and her four friends who are in general adventurous so we ordered a number of dishes that none of us had had plus one order of chicken fried rice: SzechuanGarden fish, potatoes in chili oil and something that was loofa? Fungi and something else.  All agreed that the black mushrooms in the last dish were one of the best taste experiences we'd ever had and then we discussed what the other might have been and settled on cucumber. 

We ordered for new experiences and all of the other patrons were Chinese  so not sure how they would do regular Szechuan dishes but we were all pleased.  Service was excellent with two friendly ladies and the restaurant ( and restrooms) was super clean. 

I had been there 7 years ago for lunch time curry and was also impressed but I think it is the Szechuan cuisine with its peppers where this place shines. 

Eaton here made me happy to live in Cleveland which is the highest praise I can give a restaurant."}
