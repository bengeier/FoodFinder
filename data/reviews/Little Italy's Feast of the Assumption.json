{"text":"If you've been the one you've been overall the restaurant put out good food same food every year they raise the prices it's just nice to see all the people come"}
{"text":"As a jaded old lady who's lived right on Mayfield since 2009, I despise the feast. The crowd makes it impossible to get anywhere and no one looks happy while they're here. To change that, everyone gets drunk and then it's simply a time bomb until people get out of control. The way I see it, nothing is different from a normal day except the prices and the crowding. It's an obnoxious time and makes life so difficult for the people that live here because no one treats it like a living space--it's Little Italy! How could people live here?! It's just restaurants and fun times! I had to drive the wrong way down a one way to get to my garage and THEN we got wedged into the driveway because of the chaos. Sorry I'm a huge grouch and this review probably doesn't count. Haha, oh well. 

I really need to move..."}
{"text":"This annual display of Italian-American food and culture never gets old! While navigating the crowded masses of people and finding a suitable place to park can be time consuming and tricky, don't let that stop you from attending this event at least once, it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Best italian festival of all time in the entire USA! Been going since I was born. So many local vendors, so many local folks from the community that plan the entire years for this. The local charities and churches immerse themselves to provide entertainment for all groups of people and ages. The food is off the hook. Every restaurant and bakery goes all out for the festival. Italian Sausage sandwiches, many different types of pizza, pasta and seafood. This is a must visit festival while visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"I just happened to be in town on business when this event was going on and I'm glad I stopped by. It was a unique way to experience Little Italy and fill my belly with lots of goodies.  It is VERY crowded and I was only there a few hours in the afternoon, which was just fine for me! If I went again, I might try to see some of the more historical moments, like the parade and I'm sure the nightlife is a blast for those who enjoy that kind of thing.  I really enjoyed the live music.

The Feast is a four day Catholic street festival centered around Holy Rosary Church on Mayfield Road. Held annually since 1898, the Feast occurs around August 15th in concordance with the observance of the Assumption of Mary (or for non Catholics, when she went to Heaven). It includes a procession of a statue of the Virgin through the streets leading to the church, as well as a nightly mass. And lots and lots of food!"}
{"text":"Not the BEST time to come to little Italy...Sometimes the food can be mass produced and overpriced...
Just sayin'

But I did have a pretty decent Italian  sausage sammich! And the sauce was wonderful!!!!"}
{"text":"Walking down the streets of Little Italy, I realized how lucky I am to be a part of such a celebration and how lucky I am to live a bit further away from the action, people can party! The entire festival is amazing and a must see for people who have not been here yet.  There is food literally every five steps you take, so you have to pick and choose what you eat or you will never make it all the way down the street.  

My favorites this year were the elephant ears on the corner of random rd and Mayfield and the meatballs from Corbos.  I also had some calamari from Maxi's but I wasn't too impressed.  All the vendors and restaurants have abbreviated menus so the wait for food is usually pretty quick.  

I love the hustle and bustle but be careful of how high of heels you wear, I know I got bumped around a lot.  Enjoy your time there and make sure you bring your ID as most places at night won't let you get in without it!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Feast of the Assumption located in Cleveland's Little Italy(usually runs 2nd weekend in August), have been going pretty regularly for the last 10 years and it never disappoints....I went on Saturday mid afternoon on a gorgeous day and Mayfield Road(the street FOA is on) was already rocking!!! Rows and Rows of local restaurants/vendors with canopy tents that have a wide range of foods for consumption.....most places have Cavatelli & Meatball, eggplant, Italian Sausage w/pepper and onions, stuffed banana peppers(with sausage), pizza, risotto, artichokes, calamari, italian sandwiches(beef,meatball or sausage) and of course desserts, which consists of cannoli, napoleon, or cassata cakes to name a few!!! I always visit the same 2 or 3 vendors every year, that would be Corbo's for their Cavatelli and Meatball, Presti's Bakery for their sweets (this year went with Cannoli w/chocolate chips, napoleon, and tiramisu delicious)...I also usually pack a cigar to smoke after dinner : ))  One of the pitfalls of the festival is trying to eat pasta and meatball standing amongst a crowd with a plastic fork (especially when it gets crowded)!!! Almost impossible, so this year we found a nice patio at Guarino's, picked up a few food items there and made our way to patio, it was awesome to chill, eat our italian dishes...added bonus, there was a waiter out there on the patio so ordered a few Peroni's (italian beer) and lit up my cigar !!! Truly an enjoyable experience...I try to attend local festival's in Ohio, and there are so many good ones, but The Feast is personally my favorite....One of the other great things about the FOA is just the people....so many nice people, who strike up a conversation with you - friendly, heartfelt and just there to have a good time....After an hour on the patio walked over to the playground at the bottom of the Hill and it was a perfect place to tire out my daughters before we made the 2 hour trek home to Columbus.....Playground is big, there were plenty of Porta-Potties and sinks to clean up....not a lot of shade but some benches scattered amongst playground...one of the few pitfalls about the festival is parking....The festival is in a neighborhood, so street parking is very limited, some on Murray Hill, a few lots near Case Western available, but be ready to walk.....1/2 mile to mile to get to fest....of course you can pay $5/$10 to park but again still a walk attached to get to & from fest....Don't let the walk scare you away, get to the The Feast of the Assumption festival in Cleveland located in Little Italy, enjoy the neighborhood, restaurants, food and people....You won't be sorry : ))"}
{"text":"Such an awesome time. This year I had the pleasure of bringing my little Princess with me. She must have been mind blown. Upon arrival we parked on a front lawn of an apartment building. I had to reverse it on the sidewalk and park it on the lawn.  

We had Lamb-kabob, delicious. The mix of people, plethora of food and just the atmosphere is breath-taking. 

I try to go every year and check out all the guidos, biggest douche this year had a Sopranos t-shirt on. My Daughter kept making me stick out my arm so she can limbo, shes awesome. We both had Gelato for the first time. 

We stayed til close and left with a sense of fulfillment."}
{"text":"This was a great event. I have an Italian fest back home which I normally love, but the Feast has trumped it. I never thought I was going to see cavatelli ever again. Low and behold i found some there and they were delicious. Bands everywhere, and a tremedous amount of food options. Im used to see one beer tent and festivals, but here pretty much every restaurant had one. Which was cool, and they all agreed on prices for drinks. The rides were on a side street and away from everything else and not in the way with kids running around everywhere. 

I cant wait for next year."}
{"text":"People are constantly telling me that one thing I absolutely must do in Cleveland is visit the Feast of the Assumption. After finally doing just that, I have to ask myself.... why? 
If Italian food is what you're after, you can literally come to any of these restaurants and get the SAME exact dishes for cheaper and more conveniently (as in, actually sitting at a table and eating your food). Maybe I'm starting to become one of those curmudgeons who hates throngs of people at festivals, but I just tend to get a little annoyed how people tend to only come out to these places when there's a big event (ahem* Asian Festival*). 
All that being said, yes all the food in Little Italy actually is very good, but I can't help but think you're sacrificing on quality a bit when the food is mass produced to sell on the street, but that could just be me. I will admit it is fun to people watch here.... lots of Jersey Shore wannabes and old school Italians alike. The bocce ball tournament is equally fun to watch as it is perplexing. Of course I have to gripe a bit about the parking... $10 for lot parking as there is no street parking to speak of. My recommendation is to skip the Feast and come here any other weekend, you'll have a better experience and you won't have to pay for parking!"}
