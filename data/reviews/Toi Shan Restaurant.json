{"text":"Possibly Calgary's best kept Chinese food secret, have eaten here and had the takeout numerous times and it is always excellent food. Great service in the restaurant too. Get there early on weekends as it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering take out from Toi Shan in probably a year. When we lived near by, we ate here every month or so. I am pleased to note that the quality of the food and serving size is as good as I remember.   Having ordered nine different dishes this evening, all six of our guests enjoyed every single dish. Although, not the best Chinese food I have had it certainly is very good, always consistent and reasonably priced. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Prototypical Canadian Chinese restaurant, albeit with incongruent, large format urban view photos from IKEA on the walls.  Maybe a dozen tables for dine-in, but they seem to do a brisk take out business.  Generous portions served piled high onto small, thick white oval dishes which test your manual dexterity to not lose the contents in a food avalanche.  Had the Mandarin combination hot plate, and the Szechuan noodles. The hot plate was pretty good, with large pieces of juicy chicken, BBQ pork and shrimp, and a somewhat spicy, well seasoned sauce.  The rice bucket was more than adequate for two of us.  The Szechuan noodles on the hand were not spicy at all, as one might expect...they were really just Shanghai noodles by another name.  The food came out fast, and the tea was late but remarkably good."}
{"text":"Very welcoming for my first time, also you can tell by smell, feel excellent care in cleanliness daily was happy money well spent."}
{"text":"Had NYE's take out here. The food was the best Chinese food I have had since being in Calgary. It was incredibly busy. While waiting for our takeout, we got to see many dishes being delivered to the restaurant patrons. They all looked and smelled amazing. The only reason I do not give this a 5 is that the inside of the restaurant is nothing spectacular. If you're only interested in it for the food and not the ambiance this is well worth the trip there. Despite being incredibly busy, the staff were tremendous. Food came out quickly and the staff all maintained a very friendly demeanor"}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese food. It's a typical small Chinese place, fairly generic decor, but don't be fooled; the food is great and the price is good. Service is quick and courteous. The fried rice with shrimp is very tasty and the sweet and sour pork has some tang. Highly impressed."}
{"text":"We have ordered from or eaten at Toi Shan for the past 20 years. Up until the last year the food was very good. If you ask they won't say if it has changed owner and/or chefs.  Well we don't recognize any of the staff and now the food is terrible.  We tried one more time this past Friday and  the spring rolls and dumplings were inedible as they were dripping with grease.  The quality has gone completely down hill and we won't be back"}
{"text":"Just not exactly sure about how to grade this place.  The sweet and sour pork was better than i expected from this suburban chinese resto, and it's your typical hole-in-the-wall.    didn't like the presentation, esp. when they brought out the soup bowl, just slushing around everywhere by the time it reached the table, and dripping on the sides.  yup...not a repeat!  free parking."}
{"text":"Been quite a regular here for last several years and it's the best Chinese food in the SW Westbrook/Signal Hill area. Their ginger squid is one of the best in the city.  Chow mein can be a bit better though...seems that there are a lot of sprouts vs. Noodles.  Overall, definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"It took us a long time to find a great Chinese food restaurant in Calgary. Thankfully, we found Toi Shan and this is always our go-to for Chinese food. We have been going there for years and we always look forward to returning. The food is delicious and the prices are fair. We just can't get enough of the Salt and Pepper Squid, the Egg Foo Yung, the Sweet and Sour Pork Tenderloin, just to name a few. YUM! Already looking forward to our next visit."}
