{"text":"How do you eff up an orange julius--especially when  it's your signature drink. It was mother effing hot out and all I wanted was an orange julius. I even passed up 8 icee flavors because I said I'd opt for the orange julius instead.   $5.00 down the toilet. It just wasn't done right. Maybe the instruction booklet was missing that day."}
{"text":"This bro made the best orange Julius I've had in my entire life. He made myself, and my beautiful girlfriend, feel so pampered and taken care of. I will return to this DQ/OJ anytime I am seeking a quick fix for some upside-down ice cream and a dope orange j?l. He deserves a raise or bonus for how well he treated us."}
{"text":"Husband ordered a pina colada smoothie from here - drinks in Vegas are generally Expensive but this place had smoothies that were delicious and refreshing. It's pretty much a jamba juice located inside the mall."}
{"text":"Ah yes. Reminiscent of my childhood days the orange Julius kiosk in the malls.   I was feeling disappointed when the orange Julius recipe just isn't the same slushy treat but instead watery.   The employees here recommended putting in some ice cream to bring back the slushy feel. They nailed it and really hit the spot.   Those who were disappointed in their orange Julius experience try above and you won't be disappointed again I promise"}
{"text":"Super duper long wait.  One girl working, taking a long time w/sandwiches & hot dogs.  Seems that they need a second employees to handle the line of people, many of which walked away.  Not good business.  Apparently on Mondays, just one working.  Ice cream was fine, out of cherries for the sundaes"}
{"text":"Ordered the orange julius and was disappointed once again...  A new worker made my drink and had to review the ingredients before making it.  It tasted horrible...  Stick with the DQ items and get a blizzard."}
