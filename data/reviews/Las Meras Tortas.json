{"text":"Yum! Really great authentic and Mexican food! Tortillas and chips made fresh!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Autentico, delicioso, perfecto. Bomb.com Authentic, delicious and perfectly made! It's tha bomb.com."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's like eating out of a Mexican taco truck(which I love!) but with a small seating area. I have only had the burritos, I am the kind once I find something I love I don't usually verry from it. The food is fresh made, authentic, priced very well for the quality and quantity! You can call ahead and have it ready, as there is very limited seating. But I am telling you, it is some of the best authentic Mexican you will have in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"The authenticity is what makes the food great!  Fresh hand made corn tortillas.  I got 5 of the barbacoa (shredded beef) tacos.  I will def be going back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to give this place a shot!! Delish!!! I ordered the steak and barbacora tacos!!! The best tacos ive tasted in the charlotte(surrounding areas). I found the cashiers dont speak english to well. Therefore you must really listen when your order is up and recognize your order. Otherwise, this will be my street taco stop from now on."}
{"text":"The best place to get Mexican food around!  Staff is always friendly and service is generally quick."}
{"text":"Very good.  I get mine to go. Authentic Mexican.   Love the quesadilla and burritos.  Have told many friends about them and those that have tried all tell me thanks they really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I am an expert when it comes to Mexican food. Especially that of the taco shop sort and the food here is like that of which you would find in Southern California and the Baja Peninsula. Authentic and delicious. It's filling tho so don't plan any strenuous activity afterwards."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, its a tiny place by a gas station but they have great sandwichs,  tacos, sopas and pupusas.  My mission is to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"First let me say I am a practicing Vegan. However, I treated myself to a birthday cheat meal. I love off the beaten path food. I had read some reviews of this place long ago. Since I live close by, why not!Please don't let its location fool you. Authentic and delicious! Take it to go and enjoy it at home. I had Los Huaraches with Al Pastor meat.  Hate admitting this... I hadn't eaten all day and everything smelled amazing. Since it's rare that I stray from my normal Vegan diet, I went all in. Like a bad gambler! With that said- I also 3 tacos. Carnitas, chicharrón and rajás. The chicharrón was tender and melts in your mouth. Carnitas was super flavorful. Rajás was just ok. The tacos are street food size. Small and tasty.  I couldn't get enough of Los Huaraches. Tons of delicious meat.  So basically if your going to cheat on your super healthy way of life, this is the place to do it!"}
{"text":"This place has great barbacoa tacos (shredded tender beef). The quesadilla (cheese with meat) and sopas (thick corn) are awesome as is anything with the carnitas (fried shredded pork) on it. The green salsa is HOT just the way I like it. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican Food seems very authentic.  Very well served. Will not leave hungry. Limited seating and hot inside, but the food is worth it. Ordered the Carnitas Burrito ang Guacamole and chips. The bomb. Will definitely return. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once but I loved the food. The chorizo is great and the portion is plenty. The only downside is the limited seating for the customers. I recommended take out if you decide to eat there as there may not be any seats left."}
{"text":"We were on a long road trip and I was glad to find a place that served very good homemade Mexican food.  Good people, good food and clean restrooms and a place to fill up along the way.  I was lucky enough to find this tiny restaurant while heading north and then I found them again on my way back home."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now, and finally decided to eat here on 4/11/2018. The Cashier/Server(?) had a very bad attitude. I ordered a torta de asada.. and right off the batt i told her i did not want any onions, mayonnaise, and jalapeños. i asked her what else comes in the torta and she told me a side of fries.. i repeated my question \"what else comes in the torta\" she said carne asada.. which is OBVIOUS because that's the one i chose. then i ask her AGAIN what comes in it.. then she says avocado. i told her i don't want avocado either. like 10 minutes later i get my order... and my torta has jalapeños in it. My friend's Al Pastor Torta was too salty. Service was just BAD."}
{"text":"Super tiny place, full of super delicious food.  If you want Mexican, this is a great place to go.  The flautus are nice and crispy, the burritos are huge, and the horchata is delicious and they have red and green sauce, woo.   I haven't had Mexican food that is really Mexican since I left Texas, so I was happy to find this place.  It is next to a gas station with a small parking lot, there is very limited indoor seating, but they have a good size menu, and the wait is never terribly long, but it's not 'fast food'.  I've been here twice now and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"You'd never guess that tacos and elote this delicious would come from a tiny place connected to a gas station.   You need to go here.  Pibil tacos are flavorful and tender. Refried beans are velvety and seasoned. Flautas are crispy and covered with jalapeños, crumbled cheese, avocados and are SO satisfying. And the elote is salty, cheesy, and savory--just don't eat it on a first date. It's messy as hell, but you won't care if you're with friends. Oh, and the red salsa is SUPER spicy, and this coming from someone who loves heat.   This place is definitely worth your time and the mere couple of bucks it'll cost you."}
{"text":"Great food, long lines at lunch, but they could spend a little time cleaning up the tiny dining area, it was filthy!  I will stick to take out next time."}
{"text":"This place is great. Don't let the location dissuade you from eating here, it's completely worth it. It's authentic Mexican food like Sopes and Cemitas- basically you pick your deep fried base and add a meat (carnitas, al pastor, steak, or chicken), then it's sprinkled generously with fresh cheese and cream. There's no bad food choice. Try one of the Agua Frescas! The Maracuja (passion fruit) is delicious."}
{"text":"Truly legit hole in the wall. Tiny place with just a few table adjacent to a gas station convenience store. I went for a quick torta (sandwich). It was delicious and giant, made fresh while I waited. Hope central Charlotte gets one of these shops!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!! An authentic and delicious Mexican place to eat. I moved here from California and tried a few Mexican places, I had almost lost hope until I found Las Meras Tortas! They have the best elotes and make street style tacos w/cilantro, lime, and onion that are fresh and to die for! ALSO!! They have 99¢ taco Thursday. Plus, the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Ordered, Las Chidas Pastor Con Queso sandwich with fries, 2 tacos-one barbacoa, one lingua and an order of gorditas-barbacoa, Al Pastor and Carnitas. Got it to go.  Small place with loud Latin music playing through a not so great sound system. 4 small indoor tables, and a few on the outside. The floor could have been a little bit cleaner, but it is a rainy day. 94.5 rating. Very friendly guy at the counter with a nice smile.  The taco was very good, the barnacoa anyway. Didn't have the lingua, don't know if he heard us order it, or it just didn't make it in our bag. Nevertheless, the one we did get was delicious. The sandwich...OMG! It was a masterpiece. Stuffed with pork, onions, avocado, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato and mayo. I split it with my hubby, not sure you could eat a whole one! The fries came fresh out of the fryer and were crispy and great. Don't typically have fries with a torta, but didn't want the other choice of plantains.  We split one gordita, saving the other two. Homemade gorditas, with a nice portion of pork and Mexi cheese. Absolutely scrumptious. I expect the other 2 to be just as tasty. I would eat here once a week if it was near me. You must try this place for some not so pedestrian and truly authentic Mexican fare. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My go-to Taco Tuesday spot. You would never guess a gas station restaurant would be so good! Real authentic tacos that you can watch them flatten out the tortillas right in front of you and cook them on the stove. The place is really small and connected to Pitt Stop gas station but there is always a line of people ordering to go and few people eating a the few tables they have available.   The barbacoa tacos are great!! I can usually eat about 3 of them but I usually get a side of Mexican corn that is the best I've ever had! The lime juice that they add makes the corn taste amazing. The churros for desert on the way home is a must!"}
{"text":"Very Dirty, 82 inspection  grade. I still tried it. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, street corn, and tortilla chips. First they don't have chips, so the guacamole and chips is out. So I asked for soup as my side like on the menu. 20 minutes later they tell me they don't have corn. So they give me a 2.50 refund. Finally 30min later I get a sandwich. It's basically a ground beef taco sandwich with fries.. that's right, no soup either. They forgot to tell me. I didn't want to complain again so I ate the burger and fries. Now I need a serious antacid. The other location has a better health department score. I would recommend avoiding both though."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this one because they have one price listed and another one when they ring you up. I ordered a Mazatleca for $8.50 and a Mango agua Fresca for $1.99 but was rang up for $9.00 and $2.50. I called the cashiers attention to it and he said the owner changed the prices so it is what it is. I wonder which agency I should call?"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Moved here from California and this is the most authentic Mexican food I've had here"}
{"text":"Drove past after a medical procedure. Did not know this place existed. Now I do. And I'll be a regular. Place was packed! It took a while to get my food, probably because they make everything fresh. Tortillas are made to order. Pressed before your eyes. I cannot wait to try everything on the menu. I had a Carne Asada torta,  chicken flauntas, and a cheese. papusa....all fantastic. generous portions too...very authentic. my hubs and I are from cali....did I mention how happy I am!!  special weekend menu too! carnitas by the pound and special soups."}
{"text":"Tried Las Meras today for the first time and it was really good.  Used to live in California and it was like I was still there.   The food was very fresh and authentic.   Had the Carnitas Burrito and the Beef Flautas.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Las Meras Tortas is a must try in Huntersville! Food is truly amazing and authentic. I love the las sopes, puposas and chicken quesadilla. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful! It is a Mexican restaurant next to a gas station, the food is wonderful and authentic. The staff is friendly.  Always a great experience l!"}
{"text":"True blue hole in da wall! Can only seat maybe 6-8 folks.  Menu is full of authentic Mexican and South American food!  Real deal here folks!   Affordable too!   Our family tried to order differently to sample a few items.  Here we go -  Tacos  we tried the Al Pastor GOOD ONE - the BARBACOA - SLAMMING y'all best of the bunch - the Lengua - bland and not as tender - Tripa (pork chitterlings fried) nice texture with the crunch but also bland.    Las Sopes - fried corn flour topped with your choice of meat beans and cheese.  Barbacoa again the favorite with Al Pastor ( spicy pork) in 2nd place!   Papusas were awesome very meaty served piping hot fresh and the vinegar slaw ( can't remember the name)is a great compliment!!!  Elcote Locos - Mexican street corn  covered in cotija cheese and a spice mixture with good flavor I loved it hubby not so much !     WARNING- their sanitation rating was only 82 so yeah there's that but I do believe I'll return."}
{"text":"I had the Cubano, Jamon and steak cemita, and tortas ahogada. They are all a form of sandwich. Overall average taste. The breads are soft. I like the tortas ahogada, which is dipped in salsa. They have a salsa bar with varieties of salsas and fixing for tacos.   Personals are very nice. Place is clean. Lots of choices including burritos, tacos, ice cream, variety of Hispanic fruit cups, sope, huaraches, ice cream, and empanada desserts.  They also have a few options that you can create your own meal with three types of meat and sides including beans rice and sweet plantain.   Likely will come back to try other items. As for the tortas, it is not the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The torta oaxaqueña was amazing -- maybe the best torta I've ever had -- and was big enough that I was able to save half of it for dinner. If this place was closer to my house, I would eat here all the time."}
{"text":"The food is really good, lots of flavor, just be mindful of the hours Sunday...they actually close @ 9pm not 10pm, Luckily I was able to get my taco craving"}
{"text":"I'm no expert and I don't know if it's really genuine authentic southern food or just locally sourced food-stuffs prepared in the southern tradition but I like it and it's a pretty good deal  and it's a great location heading in to work: if I didn't gas the truck the night before and skipped breakfast I can fill up twice on one stop. Got a little efficiency kitchen stuck on the side of a mini-mart. You get to see everything that goes into making your food so no surprises! Since I don't see breakfast pizzas on the menu I've been into the Huevos Rancheros + rice + beans + bonus tortillas: ¡It's so bueno!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Real Authentic Mexican place in Charlotte and I have found it. The amazing staff does not speak any English so please come prepared with Google Translate if you need help ordering food. The menu descriptions are in English. This is a fast casual style restaurant. They offer papusas, flautas, tacos, burritos, Tortas, and more. The Tortas on the menu are named \"las Chidas\" but they are in fact the Mexican sandwiches. They offer a red and green sauce/salsa. They are spicy but so tasty. I recommend the orange rice! Yum! They also offer catering and with their very affordable prices, I would recommend them. I have used them for a work luncheon and they did a very well organized job. I come here often for lunch and sometime pick up dinner on the way home. My workmates and husband are also very big fans. They offer a variety of Mexican meats and the flavors are bold and delicious! Today they even had tacos on special for $1 today so I will keep a look out for that again. Normally they are $1.90. Please support this local business!"}
{"text":"Environment was not ideal. Lacked AC and it doesn't have any space inside to dine in. But, I was surprised how delicious the food was for such a hole in the wall. I do like that it is beside a convenient store. Was able to pickup some Cervezas while my food was being prepared. Service was great and the food preparation time was ideal. Would gladly order food here again."}
{"text":"Sadly, we don't go here anymore.  Their service has plummeted, and the food just isn't as good.  Their health scores are also of concern.  Here's the case of a small restaurant being unable to handle the increased attention brought on by the review excitement."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Don't let the fact that it is next to a gas station stop you from trying it out."}
{"text":"This is a staple small whole on the wall Mexican restaurant, great location on an even better demographic. This is how you know you're eating authentic mexican food; we came here for lunch and had our typical meal, torta! I was impressed with the diversification of the place, the place is divided in areas, each presenting a specific specialty; the most visible at the entrance ia the snacks, there are typical Mexican snack such as mangoneadas, bionicos,  prepared elotes, fresas con crema, raspados, tostilocos among other classics. The end space to the left is a an area on the side with only sweet bread and torta, telera and bolillo bread as well! Of course the signature mexican flan and chocoflan with flavored jello next to them. Last to the right side of the business is the restaurant side of the place, this simple and yet brilliant operation serves signature dishes such as menudo on the weekends, chicharrones con chile dish, tamales, taquitos, picadillo and the cherry on top, fried sweet plantain! Tortas, burritos, sopes, flautas, tacos and more, overall this place blew my mind! It is a humble locale and the employees are unassuming and efficient, when letting the waitress know I was taking pictures for yelp, she said she did not know what yelp was, lol! Our tortas were great, only Problem is torta plates come with fries, umm.... no, thank you. Great assembly and hot food, great flavor on all ingredients, can't say enough. I absolutely loved the ingenuity of selling just about everything you want when you are out to eat Mexican assortment. Super duper place!"}
{"text":"The best tacos I have had in Charlotte.  They make their own flour shells by hand.  Everything is fresh. Been here 6 times and thought I need to write a review.  The prices are also good."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican food I had in a long time. I ordered the el Pastor meat with the tacos, delicious with the green sauce. I recommend to get take out because there is very limited seatings. The best Mexican food are always hidden and delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is authentic Mexican and muy delicioso!  Tucked in next to a gas station - don't be put off by its location nor its appearance.  Hands down the best Mexican food in the area, and the price can't be beat.  Not to miss."}
{"text":"Quick service Mexican food, tortas (sandwiches) and the like.    I was on my way to Cook-Out & stopped in to fill up at the gas station just north of it (other side of the auto parts store) when I noticed this place abutting the gas station.  Very easy to miss, just a couple of tables inside, and a couple tables outside.  It's bright & colorful, with descriptions of the dishes in English on the menu board.  You order at the counter & after ~10mins it's ready.  The cashier was friendly and helpful. I ended up getting a barbacoa sandwich/torta (on the menu as \"chida\"), and it was pretty good.    The menu's fairly extensive (see pics -- tacos, burritos, several different kinds of sandwiches, etc), and I'll try other items in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderfull. The staff was nice and helpful the environment was nice bathrooms clean best mexican food iv ever had"}
