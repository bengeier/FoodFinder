{"text":"Casual lunch after a long walk through the snow. I have been here a couple of times in successive winters. Always enjoy a warm bowl of soup and a sandwich. It's a tight space and it is very casual in terms of service. That said, I couldn't fault it for what it is. Good food and a welcome spot to recharge before bracing the cold again."}
{"text":"the food is good for a simple cafe in the middle of a huge park, the food is prepared fresh and the side dish (couscous) is nicely flavoured

the smoothie is great, it is freshly blended right in front of your eyes, i would say this cafe is above average for restaurants in tourist attractions

the service is mediocre, but i believe it has improved from the previous comments, the waitress there are not as inattentive, but they are not too passionate about the job either"}
{"text":"My husband and I waited ONE hour for a coffee and two sandwiches. Everyone is stressed out and they have no system, so everyone is just running around trying to get orders done. At the end of it, the food wasn't even worth the waiting time at all."}
{"text":"Waited 15 min to be sit, when there's tables available, waiting another 15 to order, then waited to pay... We asked for water, never came... The staff were so busy and stressed. It's a coordination problem. 
Not much choices for food around, so we had to go there. But I recommend bring your own food and eat it at the park, stress free..."}
{"text":"The worst Antipasto I have ever been served. All cold cut meats and the red peppers were so cold and soggy, difficult to eat, could not even finish it. Only three slices of store-bought Swiss cheese? The only good part about it were the olives, and I bet those came out of a jar. My waitress was lovely, but they are quite obviously understaffed. Should have desperate staff for cafe and dining. A beautiful spot, surprised it's so low funded."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. Waiting in line for 20 minutes to order to go and was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. Almost an hour later still no food. The kitchen is under staffed and we watched food get dropped and used. Also they are steaming milk that had already been steamed and put back into the cooler which is a health hazard. If you're planning a nice day at Mount Royal be sure to eat before, or bring a picnic."}
{"text":"Caf√© is incredibly poor value for money, and worse than that, the service is completely disinterested. Our waitress literally walked off and disappeared, and our beverages never arrived. The only time I've ever felt like walking off without paying the bill (which we obviously never received either,) but instead we queued up like good Canadians behind 10 other people and eventually managed to pay. Make your way over to the chalet at Beaver Lac (Lac des castors) instead."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.  The cafe is located at a gold mine right by the parking lot and  the picnic area.  The entire out door cafe was run by one person.  She had no idea who came and who left so some people had to wait endlessly.  I saw what was going on so we walked up to the counter and asked her to take the order.  She informed that about half the listed items were not available and it was 12:30 pm.  Considering they have about 10 items on the menu, you have to wonder who runs the place.  I would give 2 stars for food and zero star for service."}
