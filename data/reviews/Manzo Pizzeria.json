{"text":"They make a mean sub. Bread baked in house (same consistency as the pizza dough). Swimming in vinegar. Delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent Montreal-style pizza.....thick crust, fresh toppings, flavorful sauce. I order from this place all the time and it never disappoints.   I especially like their all-dressed pizza....lots of flavor. I recommend you order extra and have it for leftovers the next day!   For Montreal-style pizza, this is my favorite place."}
{"text":"Ordered an all dressed for supper tonight. Delivery time was reasonable, pizza was hot. Pizza was delicious although it was a bit soggy in the middle. I'll have to try the subs next time."}
{"text":"The Holy Grail of Subs  Step 1 Order 14 inch, number 15 Manzo special.  (I know what your thinking. \"oh that's too much for me, I could never!\". Trust me you can, and you will get on your knees after you've devoured it all begging for more.)  Step 2 The hardest step  Wait patiently.  Step 3 Carefully transport the warm, divine \"Manzo\" to your feasting place of choice.  Plant both feet on the floor, lift with both hands and brace yourself.  Orgasmic. You may need a smoke after your done. Oh and I told you you would beg for more.   Delicious. Fuggedaboutit'"}
{"text":"Best sub I've ever had, seriously amazing and I will be returning I'll be dreaming of my next sub  I've been back and it's just as good as the first AMAZING"}
{"text":"If you are able to overlook the way this place looks, you will love it.  In my humble opinion, it is the best sub in mtl, eventhough it is actually in Lasalle. It's 20 min from downtown mtl but worth the ride!!!  The bread is made from pizza dough, it is soft, and melts in you mouth. The crust is just lightly crispy and tender, it won't graze your upper palate.  The sub comes in two sizes 10\" and 14\" which range from 11.50$ for 10\" to 13.95$ for 14\". I usually order the 14\" eat half and save the other half.  I usually order the manzo special or the meat eater which has steak pepperoni and ham for those who like meat...  There's lettuce and tomatoes, but the special vinegar that they put in, is amazing, it counters perfectly the saltiness of the meat, and makes this the perfect sub, in terms of taste and bread texture!!!  I have friends from Vegas and NYC who always ask to come here when they visit, it's that good!!!  sup sup manzo sub, with somethin somethin !!! crazy yo!"}
{"text":"Very great sub and pizza. Don't let the decor the restaurant fool you. The food is very fresh and delicious.   Personally, I would say the restaurant is a little over hyped but regardless the food still tastes great.   The pizza is thick but crispy. The subs are big thick and tasty made with fresh homemade bread. Overall it's great takeout food and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. For many years manzos was the best subs in LaSalle. Last little while the quality has slipped. Orders not correct, missing sauce, extremely long delivery waits, etc. Hopefully will get better and be as delicious as it used to be."}
{"text":"Best Sub I've ever had, hands down, no contest!!  i was introduced to Manzo about 4 years ago by a friend of mine who has since passed on (R.I.P Chris, you're dearly missed). He told me once I go there, I would always return when i'm in the area.  He was right, I live in the east end so about a 35-40 minute drive depending on traffic but whenever I am in Lasalle for whatever it may be, I make a pit stop at Manzo.  14 inch #15 Manzo Special PLEASE!!  i've hyped this place up to many friends who told me I was nuts but after trying it, always agreed, best sub in the city.  Can't wait for my next Manzo sub!"}
{"text":"Value for money and taste. Also really friendly staff. Not a fancy place but really good pizza."}
{"text":"This place definitely tops my list for the people's champ in terms of pizza and subs. This place definitely joins my dreamteam alongside my favourite burger joint, shish taouk spot, gyro spot and other tasty high caloric density specialties"}
{"text":"Pretty nice subs, the kind I grew up with and don't see much of anymore. Glad we found it. Seating is just a bunch of chairs and tables, order at the counter, but they did bring it to the table. Lots of take-out and delivery happening."}
{"text":"Amazing subs!  I always make a stop at Manzo whenever I am in town.  They they always deliver an amazing eating experience.  A must try for anyone that wants to try a very unique submarine."}
{"text":"Pretty good subs, not as big as subways or some pizzarias make'm but worth it. Its up there with Momesso's"}
{"text":"The best subs in Montreal. Home made bread and stacked full of meat. And when I say stacked, I mean stacked like Dolly Parton in the 80's. Now that's stacked!!! I always order the 14 inch #15 Manzo's Special.  Pizza's are supposed to be amazing as well, but I've never tried them even though I've been going to Manzo's for the last decade. I'm the type of guy that once I find something I like, I stick with it (hence the reason my wife is stuck with me). I'll have to try the Pizza next time I'm in Montreal.  Service is pretty fast for take out. I've never ordered delivery so I don't know about that.  The only bad thing about Manzo's is the location. If you go for take-out or to eat there (only has two tables), the parking is awful. There's only 2-3 parking spaces that are usually taken. You can park on the street, but again, they are mostly taken. There's no point in going there as you can order delivery.   Regardless of the parking and seating issues, it's definitely worth a visit to try the subs!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend their submarines. They are a bit pricier than other places but definitely worth it. They do deliveries!"}
{"text":"The sub at Manzo lives up to the hype! My Spécial Manzo was a huge 14\" monster with generous amounts of steak, Italian sausage, pepperoni and bacon, melted cheese on mushroom, green peppers, and a perfect sub sauce. Even the bread was soft and perfectly enjoyable. It's kind of like a good pizza turned into a sub. I was scared at first by the $15.50 (tax included) price tag but I was left with no regrets and had to pack the second half for another meal.  Very friendly service. No decor but for a sub this good, who needs that kind of nonsense? I think the sub is on par with the famous White House Sub Shop in Atlantic City.  I haven't tried the pizza here but seeing the high quality meat and dough I had, I can only imagine it being pretty incredible."}
{"text":"They've been around for a while and I still love their pizza (voted best in Montreal 2001). I once asked the owner by don't they offer 2-for-1 Pizzas like the competition, and he replied that 2-for-1 is for dogs! After eating at some of these other places, I'd have to agree.  They've got pizzas and subs, too. Pick it up in-store and get a 15% discount, basically saving yourself the taxes. You can eat in, if you like. There's just not many seats available.  Ask for their business menu, where you can order stuff delivered to your workplace at a discount of the regular price."}
{"text":"Holy cannoli! If you're looking for a place with authentic, delicious submarines, you have to try this place! At first I was wondering what all the hype was about because there wasn't any glitzy signs or fanciness, but after I tried one I have to say it was the best money I've spent on food in a long time, and it's clear the money goes into the quality of the food rather than the glamour. I couldn't even finish it, and ended up saving the other half for later. The helpings of good quality meat and cheeses look to be more than the price you are paying. I was looking to try the best of everything in town, and I think I've found the best subs in Montreal! Now I'm visiting from the United States, and I've been to a lot of food places all over the east and west coast and throughout the other side of Canada. I really enjoy driving off the beaten path to find that little \"hole in the wall\" place with the delicious eats. Manzos lived up to the hype. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Best subs I've ever had in mtl! House sauce it's delicious as well! Manzo sub is a must try"}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and the pizza and submarine  were delicious! For sure I will get back and order the other things :)"}
{"text":"I've been ordering here for 32 years now!! They have the best of everything but my favorite all time is the BBQ poutine!! Steak cut fries, bbq sauce & mozzarella cheese melted in the pizza oven until it forms a crispy golden layer and they aren't cheap on the cheese!! I have never found anything close to how it is made from another restaurant. I know the conventional poutine has cheese curds but Manzo's takes it to another level!!!"}
{"text":"A year after Andrew's review and all the facts are still true.  They do pizzas, but my uncle took me here for the subs.  They're huge, and piled on with all sorts of meat.  I couldn't even begin to tell you all of the ingredients stacked on our sub.  Good stuff, just real greasy.  But that's its appeal."}
{"text":"Le meilleur resto de pizza et sous marins a lasalle.  Toujours excellent !!!!  Si vous commandez un sous marin demandez la vinaigrette séparée ils ont tendance a en mettre beaucoup. Prevoyez commander a l avance ils sont achalandés et le delais de livraison est parfois un peu long"}
{"text":"Manzo's subs are honestly the best I've ever tasted. Bread made fresh from pizza dough; always soft. I especially love the pepperoni sub. Also, they pay the tax when you pick it up. Staff is very friendly, including delivery guys. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"En déménageant à Lasalle on m'a recommandé Manzo en livraison. Et, boy oh boy que je n'ai pas été déçue! Je dirais que la Pizza est franchement excellente, mais les sous marins.... oh WoW!!! Les sous marins sont ... oh my god... led meilleurs que j'ai mangés.   C'est sûrement pas pour rien qu'ils ont gagné des prix pour leurs fabuleux subs!!!  La livraison est généralement très rapide et les prix sont abordable. Ça en vaut totalement le coup!"}
{"text":"Pizza is out of this world! I mean I must say fresh ingredients and made clearly with love. My family are very picky and when we start looking at menus for pizza Manzo is always at the top of our list I'd even go so far as saying they win every single time!  If you haven't been you should also make time for their famous subs! Some of the best subs around Montréal in my opinion!  The place has about 4 tables near the window it is  more of a takeout kind of spot then a sit and eat location. The staff are super kind and helpful when your not too sure what you want.   If you've not gotten to this spot well what are you waiting for get out there and make your way to it you'll not be disappointed trust me!"}
{"text":"This is a Montreal institution. The pizzas are top notch, and well worth it. But it's the subs that are the real treat. Home made pizza dough sub buns, are what really make these some of the best in the city. Note that this is a take-out/delivery place, there is no eat in dinning room."}
{"text":"Amazing subs and pizzas. Home made breads one of the reasons I live in Lasalle lol. Save 15% if you pick up your order instead of delivery."}
{"text":"Owner is a racist piece of shit. Plus Seranos is way better. He was overheard numerous times calling down minorities.  Said his business does fine and doesn't need \"their\" money."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gawd. This place redefined my definition of a sub. Before coming here (subs just aren't big in Australia), all I knew of submarines was Subway - now, I'm not sure I'll be able to eat that swill ever again.  This place is a Montreal institution, just look at the other reviews. Don't be fooled by the word 'pizza' in the name - you want the sub. Just the sub. Which sub? I'm glad you asked...  Repeat after me: \"14 inch number 15, please\". That's the Manzo's Special. When I went with my friend (and Yelper Extraordinaire) Matthew P. I asked if I should get two different subs (one for me, and one for my girlfriend), you know, to try things out. His answer was an unequivocal \"No. Get two Manzo's\" and boy was he right. I could've eaten both on my own, but my girlfriend would've killed me.  Do yourself a favour, next tim you want a sub, go to Manzo's. You can thank me after."}
{"text":"Da Best       No ifs, ands or buts. This is the best submarine in Montreal. They've been voted such on many occasion, for some reason they have been out of the public eye of late but nothing has changed and they are still the undisputed king of the submarine sandwich in my book. People may go on about Momesso's or Bar Deco(who make great subs, don't get me wrong) but they don't hold a torch to a 14'' # 15 from Manzo's.        The owner refuses to open another restaurant and he doesn't advertise anywhere. This placed has survived for the better part of half a century on rep and rep alone. Montreal institution...pssshhhhfffttt, this place is a historical site. If you are in town, do yourself a favour and grab one because you will not find anything like it anywhere else.       Finally, how to eat one; this is open for debate. There are some that jump right in and let the sub run all over their face and hands and god bless 'em, they mean well but personally, I let mine sit. I always get pick-up because there are only four seats in the place so my sub sits shotgun on the drive to my eating location. In doing so it gives the sub a chance to 'ferment'. All those beautiful juices from the meats, the vinaigrette, everything sops into the pizza dough bun...now you are talking.  I propose Manzo's be made a historical landmark....anyone????  waka waka"}
{"text":"Too much hype - Amazing Subs  I had a car appointment not too far from here, so I decided to check this place out. I heard about this place from various different forums. People from Toronto, on the radio, friends, and advertising. All of them saying that this is best pizzeria and sub place in Montreal. Well I will have to cut the short on that.  The pizza is ok, the dough for me is too thick. I like thin dough with longs of toppings.  The sub however, those are definitely one of the best in Montreal. I high recommended going here and trying a sub. Don't get hyped up on the pizza....get a sub and you will be pleasantly satisfied.  One downfall, its not really a sit in place. So don't worry what it looks like, just go with a buddy or your significant and grab a sub."}
{"text":"La première fois que j'ai pu constater les glorieux sous-marins du Manzo, c'est parce que mes amis m'en avaient rapportés un après une longue journée que j'avais passée à travailler à un booth quelconque et c'est exactement ce qu'il me fallait. Parce que le Manzo est quand même assez loin de chez moi (un bon 20 minutes de voitures), c'est le temps idéal pour que tous les ingrédients apprennent à mieux se connaître et que les saveurs se mêlent les unes aux autres.  La deuxième fois, j'y suis allée en personne et j'ai remarqué que ça n'est pas très, très chaleureux comme resto. Ça a plutôt un sentiment de \"salle d'attente.\" Donc, si j'ai à y retourner, et les chances sont quand même hautes, voici ce que je conseille:  1) Appelle en avance pour faire ta commande. 15 minutes avant, c'est correct.  2) Prends le sous-marin \"spécial manzo\", 14 pouces. OUI, même toi la p'tite! Tu le coupes en deux. Tu manges une moitié pour souper, pis l'autre pour ton lunch du lendemain.   3) Tu prends ton sous-marin pour emporter et même si c'est tentant de le manger tout de suite, tu attends. 30 minutes au moins. Ça va être meilleur. Fais moi confiance."}
{"text":"The boys and I can never say no to crossing the bridges to fix our cravings for that 14 inch Special Manzo submarine. It really does make all the difference with that freshly baked bread. We ask for the sauce on the side so we can add it later when we return to the south shore. Best submarine hands down."}
{"text":"the owner talks trash about everyone.i used to go there all the time.no more.never again."}
{"text":"Une institution a Lasalle les sous marins dont le oain est fait de pate a pizza simplement sublime"}
