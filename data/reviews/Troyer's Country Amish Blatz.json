{"text":"Troyer's is a great, traditional country store and bakery. They have a great deli and lots of spices and other dry goods. Their pies and breads are beautiful, fresh, and tasty. The deli makes great sandwiches for lunch, which we ate on their porch surrounded by beautiful flower gardens. They also have a nice selection of Amish-made furniture and crafts. What a fun place."}
{"text":"This place is a riot. Apparently, it is 'kosher' to brand anything as Amish; Mexican salsa, candy, floor cleaner, etc. Somehow we are to be convinced that the product is better than it otherwise would be. We bought Amish sandwiches, based on other reviews, and they were laughably pedestrian, mediocre Amish bread, a couple of slices of Amish meat, nothing else. Apparently the Amish prefer simple, tasteless food, and wish to overpay for it. There is nothing inherently bad about this place, and it is amusing to see what is being labeled as Amish, but don't expect anything you can't get elsewhere for less money and better quality."}
{"text":"By far the best sandwiches we've had. This is a quaint country store with affordable food ($8 sandwiches) and home items. We wrote our sandwich orders on a piece of paper. You could choose bread, meat, cheese, and additions. Two of us had Ruebens, and the others had roast beef and salami. Each were piled high with meats and cheeses. We grabbed a spot on the covered porch to wait for our lunch. There were plenty of fresh farm grocery items and an extensive selection of deli meat and cheeses. This place is tucked away in the country, but it was definitely worth the drive. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Here's why it's a 5 star attraction:

Several yelpers listed items that the store carries, etc., so I won't elaborate on that.  Why I loved the store, and why it's worth the hour and a half drive from Charlotte:  the people working the store are friendly, and *engaging.*   

They have animals behind the store, and people tending to the animals are only too happy to answer any questions, etc.; same with the folks inside of the store, who sell unique Amish items, foodstuffs, etc...very engaging.

Second reason why I will return: prices are FAIR.  Many stores that follow Troyers' format are limited in their usefulness, in that it they charge too much for the items that they sell.  Not so in Troyers; everything that we saw was fair priced - so we bought several items.  Troyers' pricing, and diverse selection, made their store a useful, practical, store.  They have the usual great selection of necessary cooking and baking spices, etc.

Great job Troyers!  I hope that they continue their tradition of friendly service, and fair prices.  So long as they do, I will make the drive from Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best reubens in the Asheville area. Friendly people. Beautiful wood furniture and gardens provide a lovely outdoor seating area. The canned goods, spices, baked goods, and butters look great though we haven't tried them yet. Next time, definitely going to grab a giant cinnamon bun!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are so awesome and the bulk food store is great to find items that you can't find anywhere else. They also have a wedding venue and a couple of Airbnb beautiful rooms they offer."}
{"text":"Absolutely nowhere else to go in Asheville for deli meats, pickles, jam and spices.  The quality, prices and friendly greeting more than pay for the gas to get there from downtown.  Everything is freshly sliced to your specifications - want a half inch thick slice of horseradish cheddar or some ham you can read the paper through?  No problem.  Wash it all down with one of their old style bottles of soda.  
I don't eat anyone else's marmalade - it's chunky and not too sweet.  Their spices, sold in plastic bags or little airtight tubs are dirt cheap.  50c an ounce for whole cumin, $1.70 an ounce for flashy peppercorns (an ounce is about enough to fill a McCormacks jar.)
Easy to get carried away and buy a load of stuff but you'll enjoy eating it and much of their packaged & canned goods make great gifts at a sane price.
They sell nice looking furniture and housewares, too but I've never bought any of those."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go. Great prices and I love their sandwiches always great service and the friendliest people. Always a great pleasure everytime I go there!"}
{"text":"Everything here is high quality and home made. The sandwiches are HUGE and delicious, made to order. The baked goods are fresh and tasty too. They also have spices, baking supplies, jams, pickles, and there is furniture upstairs. The people are very authentic and friendly. A must-visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Some folks and I came in here due to a recommendation by a good friend who lives a few miles down the road. We adored this place! I will come back here every time I am in town to buy this heavenly rose soap that makes my skin glisten and smells so fresh. We bought authentic foodie ingredients here to cook dinner for the evening, and a few spa items. 

There was a white llama and some other farm animals hanging out in the back outside behind the shop that were SO CUTE! The llama really took a liking to us. 

The staff was lovely and it truly was pleasant to visit a nice store like this, while escaping the hustle and bustle and overall commonplace of stores that you may find in a large city. Plenty of parking and highly recommend!"}

{"text":"Cute place to shop and eat a sandwich. The people working there are so nice and the wrap I had was amazing! They have lots of nice Amish furniture and  yummy products to purchase."}
