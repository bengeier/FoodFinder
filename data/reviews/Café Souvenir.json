{"text":"Cafe Souvenir is such a lovely place to have brunch. SItuated in what is quite possibly the nicest neighbourhood--in my humble opinion--in our fair city, Cafe Souvenir serves up both brunch and lunch. My partner and I stepped into Souvenir around 11:30 on a Saturday morning and the place was jammed. But we waited for no more than 5 minutes to be seated (along the wall, in one of the banquettes). The turnover is quick here so do not be dissuaded by what seems like a never-ending wait.   The waitstaff were attentive, fetching us coffees and freshly squeezed juice. Both my partner and I could simply not pass on the eggs benedict--a long-time breakfast favorite of ours. The offerings were simply delicious--nice home fries that were not overcooked or blackened as they so often can be at some breakfast places, and the hollandaise sauce was a real winner. The 'fresh' fruit is served from a big container in the kitchen, in what looks like syrup, but it was tasty nonetheless. Food is served up fast.   Outremont is a neighbourhood in a traditional sense. Bernard Ave is a village-like main street with a grocery store, banks, coffee shops, depanneur and charming restos. It's hard not to fall in love. It's a respite from the hustle and bustle of other areas of urban Montreal. If you're on the prowl for some breakfast fare definitely give Cafe Souvenir a try--you won't be disappointed with the trendy yet family-friendly atmosphere and the delicious food fare.   This spot does not take reservations so arrive early or just be prepared to wait. I'm told that in the summer months a patio spills out into the sidewalk. Divine!"}
{"text":"Cute menus playing off the restaurant's name by having the menu in photo albums whose concept comes from the owner's travels and including little touches and culinary influences on the menu. With a night time menu in addition to the brunch/lunch menu, Café Souvenir is a perfect spot to either start or end your day. Brunch menu served daily from 7am to 4pm."}
{"text":"Great go-to brunch spot! Their omelettes are delicious, and they put them directly from the hot cast iron skillet onto your plate."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, Service, Food: Check Check and Double Check!  Atmosphere: Very small, somewhat cramped, contemporary, and very very cosy!  The place is bustling and alive, and the clientele tends to be the type that have gone through their \"growing-up\" period and are now in a part of their lives where they enjoy a good meal and even better company.  Very chic & located in the Laurie are of the plateau.  Service:  The staff is simply wonderful.  Good people, always smiling and very helpful in their mannerisms.  They're people you'll like interacting with.  Food: A perfect (repeated Perfect) place for brunch, the Cafe Souvenir menu is stocked with the staples of such a meal.  The food is prepared quickly, presented nicely, and the portions are generous.  A nice selection of side dishes of cheeses, meats, and deserts are on offer as well as a extended assortment of coffee.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service.  Big value.  You'll leave with the smile!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, large menu, good food and wine. Just a little traditional french joint that is as cute as a button. Nice terrace/patio as well."}
{"text":"Yes, I can make some great claims about how \"hip\" and \"cute\" and \"contemporary\" the ambiance happens to be, and despite the \"rave\" reviews, I must say that these are certainly not reasons to overlook the \"fly situation.\"  Yes, I said FLY situation.  FLY as in pesky little insects with wings.    My friend and I decided to have lunch at Cafe Souvenir on a hot summer day.  Instead of being seated outside (since the terasse was packed), we were seated deep into the bowels of this small restaurant.    What we discovered was that our meal came with some live entertainment.  And I don't mean musicians.  It came with a side order of live flies.    We pretty much had to constantly wave our hands over our food and our faces for the flies were plentiful and voracious for a taste of my meal (which as you'll read about next, was pretty terrible).  Talk about distracting and disgusting!  Ah, and my meal.  I must say that I was sorely disappointed.  I ordered lamb with blueberries, which sounds delicious since I love lamb and I love blueberries.  However, the lamb was so overdone that (even without the presence of the flies) I lost my appetite.  I had never had a bad bite of lamb in my life until I entered this establishment, and now, almost a year later, I still shudder at the memory of that terrible meal.  I've actually decided never to order lamb again at a restaurant, as I'm quite traumatized by the flavor... who knew lamb could end up tasting so horrendous?  Avoid if you want to enjoy a meal without worrying about hygiene!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best natural juices EVER and very nice brunches. Smiley staff and cute atmosphere. It gets crowd pretty quickly so better make reservations. :)"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here, and the whole experience was unpleasant from beginning to end. First, we sat outside as it was a lovely sunny morning. But the patio seating is so cramped that when people sat down at the table next to ours, we were practically touching elbows. Next, we had an awful server. She got our order wrong. My husband asked for more coffee, but it never came. And then she got our bill wrong. Plus, the food was not great. The sausage was subpar and my husband's scrambled eggs were barely cooked."}
{"text":"Although I do still come here often for brunch, I also want to shout out that their dinner menu is great as well.  I would recommend the evening's suggestions.  Love it here."}
{"text":"Very French and cozy brunch place that serves great omelette. Great patio for summer. Nice crowd. It will make your Sunday morning so much brighter."}
{"text":"On y revient pour les omelettes, au déjeuner. Depuis plus de 20 ans le chef nous offre de composer notre omelette gentiment servie à l'assiette directement de la poêlonne. Jus fraîchement pressé, terrasse ensoleillée, service attentionné accompagné du regard bienveillant de la patronne."}
{"text":"Pas mal. Nous sommes allés vers midi pour le brunch du dimanche. Il y avait une énorme \"file\" d'attente (je dirais plutôt \"motton d'attente\") et la gestion de celle-ci laissait à désirer.  Une fois assis, c'est un petit resto très agréable. La nourriture est tout ce à quoi on s'attend pour un brunch: oeufs, croissants, crêpes, jambon, saucisses... Il y a quelques options pour les végétariens (lacto-ovo).  Pour ma part, j'ai pris un muffin anglais avec fromage de chèvre et fruits frais. La portion n'était pas très grande, mais il faut dire que j'étais affamée! J'ai dû prendre un deuxième muffin anglais pour me sustenter et terminer l'énorme tranche de paillot de près de 2cm qu'on m'a servie. Le tout, incluant une boisson chaude, m'a coûté environ 13$. Par contre, mon conjoint a pris le \"Mandarin Melba\" (yogourt avec granola avec mandarines et confitures, servi avec un croissant) et il en a eu plus qu'assez pour une facture qui montait à un maigre 9$.   Le service était très efficace et le personnel était souriant et agréable.   L'ambiance était très décontractée et des dessins animés jouaient derrière le comptoir (pour les nostalgiques: Looney Tunes et He-Man étaient au rendez-vous!)  Le wi-fi est offert, mais je crois que l'achalandage a causé une surcharge au routeur qui ne m'assignait pas d'adresse IP. Je n'ai donc pas pu l'utiliser...  En tout et pour tout, un brunch agréable avec des amis, pour moins cher qu'aux Enfants Terribles."}
{"text":"Café agréable! Est-ce qu'il est si extraordinaire au point d'être mémorable et, par conséquent, à classer dans nos \"souvenirs\"? Je n'en suis pas si sûre. L'espace est petit, les boissons et la nourriture correctes, mais sans que ce soit à tomber par terre."}
{"text":"An apt moniker for a once-enjoyable and frequented breakfast joint. Somewhere along the line, this place lost the plot. Needless to say, I will not be making any new memories here.  Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch spot I ever ate at and I'm from NY. Tuna Sandwich, French Toast, Veggie Burger, Fries, Omelets , Chocolate Cake, Teas"}
{"text":"Ambiance chaleureuse, cuisine simple mais délicieuse  Idéalement, je vous recommande de réserver"}
{"text":"Visited this joint earlier in October.  I was looking for a free wi-fi place to hang out and have a coffee with an excuse to tap in to their broadband network and book some travel tickets with a friend.  The place had such a pleasant ambiance that we ended up having a lunch bite before heading over to Trudeau Airport.  I had a flight to catch and this endroit couldn't have been more memorable or more wished for!  Only pleasant memories.  This couldn't have been better planned.  Only thing is it was all around a coincidental surprise find!  Food was awesome and on a budget.  Plus, we had a chance to browse the net and enjoy good quality grungy wait service.  The food came on time and there was plenty to go around.  Truly, it's one of the few places in the Outremont region of Montreal where you can hang-out and still feel like you are in-between flights trying a catch a bite at an airport.  The interior design is flat out inspired by The Terminal - there are 3 cardboard designs encompassing three cities, NYC, Paris and Montreal with miniature matchbox planes enmeshed up on the wall are plastered above the main eating area.  The menu design is in the form of a souvenir 5x7 picture album mimicking a stamped passport with several destinations covered.  Each page is hand-crafted with a creative country old-school stamp with the departure or arrival date.  The next time you happen to find yourself in the Outremont neighborhood with pleasant company, take them to this spot.  It'll leave you both with a longing impression of mileage and travel-hungry desire to remember your stay by.  And make sure to bite into the Merguez salad.  It's lamb-delicious and hard to find in North America generally. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merguez  Quebec, Je me souviens!"}
{"text":"Je me suis installé pour le lunch, seul, et j'en profitais pour corriger des copies (je suis prof). On a insisté pour me changer de place alors que j'étais bien installé depuis même pas trente minutes, alors que j'étais au milieu d'une phrase. Attitude inacceptable. La salade césar était mauvaise, aussi. À éviter."}
{"text":"Cute place in the heart of Outremont, love their omelette and the way they serve it... you may be asking yourself when your plate arrives with only fruits \"mmm, where is my omelette\" but don't worry it will arrive shortly with the waitress holding the pan, straight from the pan to your plate, my preferred one is \"brie chèvre bleu and spinach with baguette with butter\", top your baguette with the omelette :)"}
{"text":"Petit resto/café de quartier à Outremont depuis de nombreuses années. Bonne nourriture sans prétention et service agréable.   Terrasse très agréable mais toujours très occupée.  Excellente option pour le brunch de fin de semaine."}
{"text":"Des brunchs délicieux, pas toujours très copieux, mais frais et bons, et un thé que j'adore. L e lieu est petit, mais très agréable quand on la chance d'y avoir une place (pas la peine d'essayer de réserver, nous l'avons fait une fois, mais cela n'a pas été pris en compte, je pense juste que ce n'est pas adapté). Le personnel est très agréable, un plaisir.  Mais voilà! Depuis, quelques déceptions avec le hamburger Souvenir, qui était notre favori. Les dernières fois, il est arrivé froid, un peu sec, décevant."}
{"text":"Brilliant Slow Start Friday remedy for a hangover.   A great little, near the digs, patio dining happy place."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant located on Bernard with a beautiful terrasse  The menu (brunch menu) is simple, consisting of salads, brunch classics and some main courses as well as couscous, however it is really good for the price you pay.  The service was good as well, with a friendly staff, and was quick.  Basically they have two chefs, one that stays till 15:30 and the other who comes from then till the evening, meaning depending on what time you come, you will not have the same choices.  Good place overall, would recommend if you want to eat quickly on a nice and animated terrasse in Outremont."}
{"text":"After failing to get icecream from 2 other icecreams places, we ended up coming here, which was a good choice. Very nice view, nice terrace and it's good to grab a cup of coffee, relax a bit, or come for desert after a meal. I got the red sangria, and it was one of the best ones I've had in Montreal. We also shared the chocolate moose desert with icecream, and it was so delicious! We wanted even more after we finished it. I'm for sure coming back"}
{"text":"Used to be so much better. I find the service has gone down and the food isn't very fresh. For instance, the fruit I received alongside my omelette had turned brown. My baguette was very tough (as if it had been frozen and then re-baked). Pretty insulting to customers."}
{"text":"I came to this neighborhood for my French homework..this place has a relaxing and welcoming atmosphere, the lady served me was nice. I had burrito with grilled chicken, liked the sauces~ feel warm on a rainy Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"There was a hair on my fruit plate and told it to the waiter. No apology, no price charge nothing.. Seriously, what an arrogant approach to the customers. Nobody deserves this service quality and also mentality"}
{"text":"Un café style bistro hyper sympa, j'avais pris des ufs bénédictines végé c'était pas les meilleurs que j'avais mangé à date mais correct , ambiance familiale , attention c'est très petit , exceptionnellement on avait réservé car notre ami connaissait la proprio"}
{"text":"Petit café/bistro à Outremont à la française. Si vous voulez bruncher allez y avant 15h. J'y suis allé après malheureusement et je me suis contenter d'une salade de poulet/mandarine (13,95$), assez bonne & goûteuse et pour terminer j'ai pris les 2 crêpes au sirop d'érable (6$), bonne mais sans plus ainsi qu'avec un expresso allongé (2,25$), bon & coursé. Prix ok. Service bâclé du serveur et pas trop sociable. Je n'y retournerai pas. Merci. Wifi gratuit. 3/5 Visité en mars 2015."}
{"text":"Petit café très bien décoré et très accueillant. Cuisine simple mais copieuse. Bon point : les réservations sont possibles, se que je vous recommande si vous êtes plus de 4 personnes ou si vous aimez pas attendre pour manger."}
