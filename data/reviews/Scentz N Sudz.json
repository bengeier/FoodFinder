{"text":"This is a Black owned business that specializes in Afro-centric products. I've been searching for a store like this for a while.

1 of the owners, Larry, was very helpful and knowledgeable on products. He even offered to special order for me."}
{"text":"A bit far from where we live but I loved how they had handmade incense. I absolutely loved their incense holder as it saves me the trouble of messy ashes once the incense burns. The couple who owns the store were so lovely and friendly it was such a pleasure talking to them. Will definitely go back to buy more incense and they even gave us a free pack of incense,"}
{"text":"Don't let the environment discourage you if you are a supporter of black owned and operated businesses! I went in the middle of the day on today (Saturday) and there were a few \"stray\" people wandering around, but not in front of nor near the store. 

There are clothes, accessories, and a wall of natural beauty products. Very clean store, the owners were friendly. Stopped in for a specific item and left already planning my next visit.
