{"text":"We love coming here!!! They make very good pizza, the slices are huge and prices are very reasonable. Also it is nice to have a locally owned cafe in the area."}
{"text":"Wow.  Best pizza I've had in a very very long time. Made with meticulous tender loving care using fresh ingredients by the owner (who is super friendly). Little gem, wouldn't be surprised if they start getting very busy."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. Excellent smoothie. Excellent chicken soup. Fresh ingredients. Try it!"}
{"text":"Fairly new cafe that is now my GO TO one stop shop for coffee and breakfast/lunch!! I've made it a regular habit to walk my dog and stop by to grab a cappuccino - Swiss Chocolate cappuccino to be exact.  Olena makes the best cappuccinos and she even does coffee designs to add a nice touch to every visit!  Starbucks' got nothing on Toffee.. just sayin'.  As for the fresh oven-baked pizzas, I've been guilty of eating them multiple times (don't judge me). They're delicious with the freshest ingredients and each slice has a good amount of toppings on them.  They are on the pricer side, however, you are paying for gourmet slice of pizza and supporting a small business.  I've also tried their strudels which are gigantic with just the right amount of crisp to them and they have the most delicious flavours, such as Blueberry, Apple, and Cherry.  They also offer savoury pastries, such as Chicken and Beef pastries, which are also very delicious and made fresh.  I plan to eventually try one of their sandwiches - which they just started serving.  During my short visits to the cafe, Olena is usually very engaging in conversations.  I've become such a regular client of hers that she knows me by my name.  I highly recommend checking this place out if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Americano was great but damn, the apple strudel is to die for. I was only in there briefly but I will be back. Very clean place and open kitchen so you can see the owner make your food. Smells great when you walk in, mostly the smell of pastries and if their pastries are anything like the apple strudel than damn. 
Pizza also looks great, will have to try sometime soon.
Kind of hidden, but worth a pop in. Also, unlike some other coffee places (both chains and independent cafes) this place offers fair prices."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a long time to finally have what I had been missing since I haven't lived or worked in downtown Toronto: locally owned cafe shops! This newly developed community of condos as part of the concord family has always lacked some type of restaurant. I'm so glad that this place finally opened in this area! It's great for those who live in any of the concord condos in the esther shiner and provost area.


We came by for a late dinner since we were in the area. The owner Olena is super friendly! We ordered a customized pizza from her and the pizza was full of toppings and delicious! There are lots of variety of toppings and she's also great at giving you suggestions on how to pair certain toppings together to make the best tasting pizza :) my husband and I shared a large and it was more than enough!

Since we were one of the last customers of the day, we also tried a few of her products: croissant is baked in house, soft texture with a nice flaky crust! The Americano is great - it's been a while since I've been able to buy non-chain good quality coffee and their beans are nicely roasted and the owner sourced her own beans (I believe it's Italian). Her Nutella Frappuccino is amazing - it's not super sweet, just the right balance of Nutella taste blended with ice. Nicely done and I think this should be one of the signature items for this up and coming joint.

Def. going to be back for some more food and coffee next time we are in the area :)"}

{"text":"We had their beef roll and blueberries strudel this morning! It's fresh out of the oven and delicious! We live just above this cafe and regret not coming any sooner! A great place to start your weekend!"}
