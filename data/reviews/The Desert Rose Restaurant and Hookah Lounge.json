{"text":"The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing at this family owned and managed restaurant!
 The decore is great for group hang outs or dates! We had lots of fun playing games and smoking shisha with friends here. 
The Moroccan food tasted great and was served beautifully! 
The shisha and tea were great aswell!"}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff at this new Greektown hookah bar. Very cozy, comfortable and relaxing. I'm so happy it opened up just around the corner from where I live. Also free wifi!I will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"The trial is the verdict. Unique place, interior styled like 1001 nights. You can feel the magic of the east. Quality Shisha. Quiet corner of the city. Certainly, a great dating spot for lovers and endowed poet or writers.

Premium quality clean Shisha utensils with large top that's filled carefully with the flavor impregnated hookah material.  Gives you the ultimate experience that hookah seekers travel to get. 

Restaurant offers light home-made dishes from Morocco. Made by a family kitchen style. Infused with the extracts of oriental and occidental spices."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a small GEM!! It is family owned and managed. The attention you get from the owners is amazing. I came here to smoke a hookah, the hookah was ok. I wished they had used natural coals instead of instant ones. They offered me a tea as a complement of the house, it tasted great. When the food started coming my senses were out of control. An amazing culinary Experience. Things are cooked at the moment so be patient, it will be worth your wail. I normally don't give 5 stars but this one made it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and very gracious service!  We went with a large group and had a wonderful time.  It was such a treat to try authentic Moroccan food. The appetizers were delicious and the meat in the mains was succulent.  Give it a try if you're looking for a new experience!"}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous! The photos do not do it justice. Really chill place to relax (keep in mind there are no televisions). The prices are great for sheesha and for food. I highly recommend trying the Moroccan tea if you've never tried it before. The owner is incredibly kind and service comes quite fast. I'll definitely come back with friends!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place a bunch of times during Ramadan, but they seemed closed. Are they still in business?"}
