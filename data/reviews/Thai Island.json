{"text":"I definitely have some sort of obsession with Thai Island when I'm working late and need to grab dinner at the office - my colleagues can attest to this. It got to the point where the server would smile and say, \"don't worry, we have your chicken today\" as I speed-walked towards the counter 15 minutes before closing.  I recommend their fried rice or their pad thai (for an extra $1) - however, the pad thai is quite \"shiny\" and probably isn't the greatest for expanding sitting-in-front-of-the-computer-all-day rear ends. The pad thai is also a little sweet and I start to feel a little sick if I eat too much of it ...But sick in that good kind of way - \"I just can't eat anymore but I know I'll regret it tomorrow if I don't gobble it down now.\" You can also request steamed rice, if you prefer. The basil chicken is my favourite but I tend to go with the lemongrass chicken to fool myself into thinking I'm being healthy. The basil chicken comes in a thick sauce while the lemongrass chicken is dry with a distinct flavour. Their regular serving size is a little large for me and I don't like to waste food if I can avoid it, so I usually ask for a smaller box and they're quite accommodating and charge me a lower price as well.  I frequent the location at the Bay-Adelaide Centre foodcourt - good place for a quick lunch (or dinner before 7)."}
{"text":"Thai island  use MSG . Food is bad and they dirty. I like Zteca burrito right next to Thai island. Vey healthy."}
{"text":"I just had the best fast food take-out pad thai from this place. They are generous with the chicken and it included fried tofu and 3 large jumbo shrimps.  The wait is literally less than 5 minutes. Cost is $7.49 plus tax.  I also get their rice soup pho noodles. You have the choice of egg or rice noodles - both are pretty good. They usually have a daily special noodle soup displayed on the counter. There is a $0.30 savings from ordering the special. The usual price is $6.29 plus tax.  My other favorites from their one item menu is the pineapple fried rice and the green curry chicken or the spicy beef. The one item costs $5.99 plus tax.  The bbq chicken or beef mung is also very delicious. Its made up of rice noodles, bbq meat, spring rolls and some lettuce/cucumber/bean sprouts mixture, all in a sweet/hot fish sauce that you pour over the bowl. I believe this dish is $6.75 plus tax.  I do have to warn that eating there will make you gain a few pounds, but the taste is worth it. I highly recommend it for lunch. Also, be sure to drink lots of water after the meal. I'm always extremely thirsty an hour or two later. I believe it's a case of too much MSG? That's the only downside.  They also accept credit and debit which is very convenient."}
{"text":"First of all, try to avoid this food court between 12 and 1 if you can. It's insane. It's incredibly hard to find seats if you're in a group. All the food places have incredibly long lines.  This place didn't really have a line. And we were in a rush so that's what we went for. We should have guessed that a lack of line meant something.  None of the food is labelled so you have no idea what anything is. You tell the lady what type of noodle or rice you want and then she asks you if you want spicy or not spicy and beef or chicken. I asked for spicy beef and I ended up with some barely spicy beef with sauce slopped on my incredibly greasy \"pad sew\" noodles.   This isn't good Thai and you'll feel slightly queasy from all the grease after eating it. This wasn't even a deep-fried dish so it shouldn't be so greasy. Ugh. It was also incredibly expensive for foodcourt food. A small container and a bottle of water cost about 13 bucks. Not a good deal.   Do yourself a favour and try to take lunch at 11:30 to avoid the line-up at IQ."}
{"text":"Thai Island is better than Szechuan Express (neaby in FCP food court) for sure, but is still your standard take-out 'Thai' food. I find the food very greasy indeed, even the curry dishes which aren't cooked in a fryer. Nothing special but a fairly decent option when you're looking for a quick food court lunch."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  I can appreciate that the food was fresh, but for an hour lunch break, I feel like I waited 30 minutes for my food.  they're very busy, so make sure you go really early if you're going to risk it.  I had the veggie pad thai - there was nothing in it, no flavour or veggies for that much.   would I return: definitely not."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a food court shop. I especially am a fan of their grilled chicken fresh rolls, they are just fantastic and are served with a peanut dipping sauce. I often grab them to take home for dinner. Their other dishes are good too, it's fairly good thai food to be honest, which is why they have big line ups at lunch.   Their food is fresh, and not overcooked nor does it sit in the hot table all day either. good service, friendly counter staff and good quality food keeps me coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good for lunch! I got the beef pho and didn't expect much but to my surprise the portions were great for the price and had a lot of beef. The taste, while not out of this world, was pretty good for a food court. The complaint I have is that they seem very disorganized and waiting for the food took awhile. I will keep coming for lunch!"}
{"text":"2.5 alright. not overly impressive got the curry chicken thru mealpal.  meh chicken tasted boiled curry tasted neutral ..  had to add a ton of hotsauce to get flavout and the bean spouts were a filler that didnt match the meal."}
{"text":"Right by the cash register is where I found my favorite, healthy and fresh food.  The mango salad is nice and refreshing.  They also have a choice of shrimp, chicken and vegetable rolls in rice paper.   The chicken was my choice."}
{"text":"Don't come here....rude..they don't understand their own menu   Clearly wanted the noodle soup and not the pho   They give me the pho ...I say this isn't what I ordered  They said you wanted rice noodle with grilled chicken right ? I said ya...but not the pho broth and bean sprouts..I wanted the NOODLE soup thap has a chicken broth with the broccoli etc   They kept insisting the noodle soup can only come with egg noodles and only steamed chicken ...right ...when your menu says right there you can get it your choice of meat and rice or egg nooddle...preposterous   I'm Asian myself and you'll get this attitude from Chinese people to be frank"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this chain! I don't like fast food and I don't like fast asian food at that. There's like 3 of these in the financial district and this is the one I usually go to. The ladies working here are efficient and nice! They're always offering samples.  I like getting the old noodle+one veggie item - their tofu is super good! Mooooist as frack. I highkey like it. As for the noodle, I get the curry one and that one has just enough spice flavour for a nice kick. There's also egg noodle and rice I believe. As for veggie options, there's beans as well. I don't know about meat options but my colleagues got some chicken thing that they said was great.  The portions are HUGE. $8-9 and you don't need to eat for a good 3 days because it's just soooo much food! Damn.   I approve! Definitely would grab this if you're looking for some asian flavour during lunch."}
{"text":"For what it is, fast food Thai food. I'm a fan.  I usually order the Mung which I believe is Vietnamese but I still like it.  Working in the area, you want to spend as little time as possible in line because the longer you wait, the less likely you are to find a seat in the food court. I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 5 minutes (line up to order, pay and then for food to arrive).  As far as the food. It's quite good as far as food court standards are concerned.  If you compare it to Thai Express, it doesn't seem as greasy either.  Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"I'm a fan... I love the Pad Thai, especially at this location.  The food here just tastes better than the other Thai Island.. Seating in this Food Court is tough if you're in a group of four.  Arrive early. You might still get a table, but just have to stand over other diners till then :)"}
{"text":"For a very good quick lunch,  I do like this place.   The Basil Chicken is my favorite,  you can't go wrong with it.  Go for it.  Peter"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the reviews I've read for Thai Island, because I was impressed with it. It's fast food Thai and it's quite yummy with fresh ingredients and the service is fast. I don't know what else more you could ask of a take away Thai business? The reviews for the various locations all say \"I could get way better for the same price at a sit-down restaurant.\" - but you're not at a sit down restaurant. You're eating take-away, so judge the place by take-away standards. The food gets prepped quite differently in order to be ready in 5 minutes or less. It's a different ballgame.   With that said I enjoy the food here. Yes, it's not sit-down restaurant quality, but I don't go to McDonalds and get angry it's not Burger Shack."}
{"text":"Can you say greeeeassssssyyyy. I've gotten the two item combo a couple of times when I'm in the mood for Asian fast food. Got the pad sew noodles because they were dark (usually a sign of excessive amounts of salty, soy sauced goodness) but was instead greeted with sad, oily noodles that barely tasted like anything. The sweet ad sour chicken was weirdly mushy and the crust was separating from the meat in a weird way, but otherwise the sauce was tangy.  Wouldn't really recommend to friends, but it's so close and convenient (not to mention cheap) that I keep finding myself back here."}
{"text":"Thai Island is a great choice for lunch in the Finance District. They have both thai food and vietnamese food (such as the beef noodle soup (\"pho\") and dry vermicelli with spring rolls). There is a location in Brookfield Place food court in addition to their original Exchange Tower food court location (the 130 King St W location listed above). They do fast and tasty thai and vietnamese food at a reasonable price - it's possible to get lunch here under $6.   Things to order: Beef Noodle Soup, Pad Thai, Green Curry, Vermicelli with Spring Rolls  Tips: There are 2 lines - one line for the \"hot\" table where you can order various meats and vegetables to go with rice and noodles. The other line is for ordering noodle soups and dry vermicelli. The noodle soup line is also where you should order their deluxe pad thai that comes with big shrimps. So much better than the hot table food line!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I visited this place during our lunch. We ordered two Shrimp Pad Thai's and took it to go. This must have been the worst Pad Thai ever. The noodles were partially cooked and were hard to break apart. The shrimp tasted like it was leftovers from days ago. The meal was extremely oily as well. I DO NOT recommend this place for lunch. There are other restaurants in the food court that are far better. Do not waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"Decent Thai and Vietnamese food for a fast food franchises chain but....  1. Very very oily, I probably consumed a good cup of oil from my lunch.  2. Those 3 favour syllables: M-S-G! No wonder my basil chilli chicken and eggplant tasted so good.  I was super thirsty afterwards as you can imagine.   3.  Semi-cooked brown rice! That's is disgraceful as rice is the first thing Asians learn how to cook  4. The price of their meal is reasonable for DT financial district but you are paying the same price as if you are ordering from a Vietnamese restaurant for fast food."}
{"text":"This is the very first Thai Island before it became franchise. It used to be my go-to place for pho when I worked in the area.   I ordered the Beef Pho though Ritual and it was ready in 5 minutes. The portion is pretty decent with pho and lot of beef. Although the beef was not as soft and fatty as authentic pho restaurant, the price $7.95 and quantity was good for Toronto downtown lunch. The pho was not over cooked and still al dente. The broth was delicious and didn't have too much MSG.   Green curry was my favourite from this location, but haven't tried this time so cannot review if the quality remain the same.   I would still return for beef or chicken Pho if I crave for hearty soup noodles."}
{"text":"Ok Thai food. Main reason why I ate here was because I was hungry at 8pm and most of the places in the mall were closed except for this and 2 other stores.   The server was a little tired and not particularly pleasant but then again, this is a fast food place and they are not known for their pleasant service patrons.   Food itself was okay. nothing really special about it. Just okay."}
{"text":"Everything is made of spice! If you like various levels of fast spicy food then you should try this place. Staff is friendly but difficult to hear with accents and background noise so I ended up having a lot of spicy items when I was only looking for some spicy. Price is okay but not as cheap as I would have liked, again, possibly due to the up selling they did and me just nodding since I could not understand them.   Maybe I am just gullible today."}
{"text":"I love curry. Naturally I am a fan of their green curry. Your Thai food court restaurant.  Okay, maybe its not that great after all. Followed my colleague to get the green curry on noodles. And it does not mix well. I should have known and it should be illegal, but oh well.. c'est la vie!  *** And the nightmare continues! I hope I remember not to come back. Just horrible. Their egg noodle soup, its not egg noodle, its spaghetti!!!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the Yelp rating, was not impressed at all. Kind of want to give it a 1 to tank the rating. Spent a long time trying to find the place, but I kind of wish that I just went to the adjacent McDonald's.  Which is not to say that the food is worse than McDonald's, but really it's about the same quality. This place is the same as any other food court Asian place offering Rice/Noodles with 1 or 2 or 3 sugary fried chicken mains for 8-12 bucks. Really, I'd be happier with a McDouble and a Junior Chicken for 3.50.   I got the General Thai chicken on \"Pad Thai\", which was really just noodles with a bit of sauce. You can get something resembling actual Pad Thai for about the same price, but you won't get a main. Everything tasted OK, but was nothing impressive. Felt pretty unhealthy afterward, so it doesn't have the leg up on McDonalds in that regard.   On the plus side, serving size was kind of large, so this might be a good place for you if you want lots of cheap westernized asian food for a somewhat low price."}
{"text":"Given that this is financial sector food court fare, it could be a lot worse. I had the beef pho, which while lacking in raw meat, had passable broth. For $7 + tax though, I couldn't help but think of the real bowl of pho that I could be enjoying a few blocks away. It also struck me as a bit strange to be eating a Vietnamese meal at a place that purported to be Thai.  All that said, I came away from the meal mildly satisfied, which is far more than I could say about the neighbouring zteca. Service is fast, too."}
