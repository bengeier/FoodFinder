{"text":"I'm not too sure why there's a lot of negative reviews about Yang's Kitchen. I think their food is amazing, with fantastic sushi, maki, and sashimi selections on their menu. This is my traditional place to eat AYCE.  I admit, their service sometimes are horrible. Often times they mix up the orders, but that's easily forgivable so long as they don't mix up the bill *wink*. I have probably tried all, if not most, of their food. Their salmon sashimi is a must if you're a huge sashimi fan. They slice that bad boy thick and juicy. It just melts in your mouth.   Bottom line is, I love their food. I've been here long enough to say that I'm a regular. As I write sashimi, my mouth salivates... damn, so good."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for the lunch buffet. Literally after about 30 seconds after we sat down and got the menu, the waitress came to take our order. We told her we needed a few mins to decide and then she glared at us acting all pissed and left. Once we actually ordered, the food came out pretty fast. Everything we ordered were pretty fresh and well made. Love the atmosphere of the place, just lacked some music in my opinion.  Wasn't the best experience, some of the waitresses were rude and will ignore you if you try to ask for something. They would only voluntarily show up at your table 3 times, first to take your order, second time about 20 mins later, and lastly to take your \"last call\" and shove the check in your face to force you to leave asap.  Just felt really rushed in the end even though there wasn't any people waiting for a table or anything.  Nonetheless, I'd come back for the food but not for their service."}
{"text":"The service isn't that great, I remember at the end the server wasn't very delighted to take our desert orders.  Been here a couple of times the food selection is delightful and the taste isn't bad either.  If you're hungry I would suggest to stop by here and try it out because the food does come fast!"}
{"text":"Invited by friends to try out this restaurant, I was really excited for the all you can eat Japanese food experience but by the end of it, I left disappointed. The food wasn't very good but tolerable at the least. For a typical all you can eat place, I guess it was ok for what it was since it was similar to what you'd find at any other AYCE \"Japanese\" restaurant since it didn't taste like real Japanese food. The service was okay but no smiles from the server. It was coupled with mediocre food quality which made for a non-memorable dining experience. They did however, have a wide range of selection of food from the grill to the raw stuff. Even so, I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"You have to class sushi restaurants into two classes, AYCE and everyone else.  If you have an insatiable craving for sushi, you would head to Yang's Kitchen where you can stuff your face and be rolled out of the restaurant.  For an AYCE sushi establishment, it's pretty good sushi (AYCE standards).  In my experience eating at AYCE, there are always dishes that never get delivered...that's alright, just order them again.  The staff are not ignorant like at other AYCE places.  The staff are attentive in the sense that as soon as a plate can be cleared...that plate is taken off the table.  If you want something, you'll obviously have to ask, but stuff like refilling drinks, you should be asked if you would like another."}
{"text":"Acceptable food, but very bad service.  Waiters often forget orders or give you the wrong one.  Sometimes they say \"last call\" then forget about it.  Still, there aren't really many other similar restaurants that offer better food, so go there if you can put up with it."}
{"text":"Great food! Pool services.. They put 10% tips before tax... I guess they knows that kid of services won't get tips.."}
{"text":"You have to be careful about restaurants that offer \"unlimited sushi\". I've been to plenty of buffets where \"sushi\" is offered. Sushi that has been sitting for a while, with room temp mayo on top of discolored red and pink salmon on a small, thumbsize portion of cold, hard rice. There's that type of sushi.  A large step above is Yang Yang's. Now don't get me wrong, it's not the best sushi, but for the price (around $20 I think) you can't beat it. We had plates of tuna, salmon, california rolls, grilled mackerel, tempura, udon noodles and more tuna and salmon.   Here's my main issue with Yang Yang's ... the service is a little pushy. I was still going like a sushi eating champ, but it was closing time and the staff decided to let us know via not so subtle hints that they were cleaning up and wanted us out. What do you expect when you offer unlimited sushi???"}
{"text":"Tried this ayce by looking at all the great reviews they had. But was really disappointed! The sashimi selection was very limited, even for the weekend. The food came fast but the price for the ayce was not worth it at all!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi bar, fresh food, decent portions, reasonably priced - definitely beats any of the all-you-can-eat-sushi restaurants in Waterloo/Kitchener area."}
{"text":"Been here many times and finally thought I'd write a review. Service was very quick when it was still quite empty. When it got a bit busier the service slowed down a bit but still quick.  Empty plates literally got cleared when the last piece of food was taken off it.   Food is consistent here. Sashimi is fresh and thinly cut. Tempura hot out the fryer. The marinated ribs were also good. Dessert was good... Green tea ice cream, crime brûlée, fried banana, and mango pudding."}
{"text":"I went on Saturday January 5th, 2013. We were a part of 4 and did not wait long. The food varitety wasn't as good as other AYCE sushi. Overall it was a good dining experience but it was a very expensive one. $125 for 4 people after everything. What I am really upset about is that when we were leaving, an employee came out the door and asked if we paid. That is very embarassing and degrading to us. They think we are the type to run without paying? My cousin paid the bill, but if i were to I would have argued. After reading reviews, the owner seems cheap and does not care about sushi or customers, rather just money. NEVER COMING BACK OR RECOMMENDING THIS RESTAURANT. I already posted on social media websites."}
{"text":"Yang's Kitchen has really good AYCE sushi! Our group went during lunchtime. All our menu items were fresh esp the rice which is important to me! Rolls didn't fall apart like some other ayce places. Pleasantly surprised by the chicken teriyaki! Chicken was grilled & had flavorful teriyaki sauce. Most places have what looks like boiled chicken w/ some generic bottled sauce. We tried green dragon roll, salmon hand roll, spicy salmon roll, bbq eel roll, shrimp tempura roll, California roll, shrimp tempura, veggie tempura, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki & chicken fried rice. Our meal ended with mango & green tea ice cream. Service was amazing!  Server was pleasant & attentive. Our food came hot & quickly. Good pacing in bringing multiple items to our table such that the table was never overcrowded. We had a really great meal @ Yang's & will visit in the future! Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in ontario. My favorite  here is sirloin steak. Top quality meat. Also rolls are very good. Only thing i can complain is that they are far from where i live. Not:  you should try mango yogurt, and mango pudding.."}
{"text":"Honestly if you reserve a table at 8pm, at least tell us an estimate for waitinf time. Im ok with waiting and i get it, you're busy, but if we have a reservation and you let everyone who has no reservation go ahead of us, thats just rude.   Not point in getting a reservation for this place. Service sucks, most of the staff are rude, its slow and short staffed, & not worth going again. Food is average. Its truly a shame the service charge is included in the bill already."}
{"text":"Aweful, just Aweful. The place is way too busy and is very, very disorganized. Expect to wait a good while betweeen the time you order an item and the time you get said item.   Further, expect to get only approximately half of the items you order, and out of those half maybe half would be exactly as you requested them. For example, i ordered the chicken cutlet, without sauce, instead got the pork cutlet with plenty of sauce drenched on top; ordered the sushi pizza without any toppings, just the rice part without sauce, instead got the the rice with mayo on top; ordered shrimp & vegetable tempura, got shrimp only....you get the idea.   Had to request the tempura 3 times before getting it (incorrectly, as noted above), but at least got some...   The problem is that they have too many tables, too many patrons, and too many staff that dont know whats going on. Also, you dont have an assigned waiter, its random waiters/waitresses that walk by and take orders, and other random waiters dropping off food at your table, regardless of it being correct or not. There is no accountability with orders.   I have been to other AYCE sushi places, and yes there has been the occaisional glitch, but the hit rate on ordrers i would estimate at 90-95%, as opposed to this place where its 40-50%....   As far as the quality of the food goes i would say just average for most of the stuff, except for the beef dishes and teriaky salmon which were above average.   Regardless, i am banning this place permanently and will not be going back ever again."}
{"text":"Fast, good portion size, good taste. I am impressed and very satisfied with my last visit. I recommend the green Dragon roll and black Dragon roll. The shrimp tempura was fried very nicely as well.   Good value for the price. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time at Yang and I would have to say it was very disappointing. Fair warning, there are a few items on the ayce menu that are limited to 1 order per table. On our first visit, they did not have the crab legs available, which was fine they had other varieties to choose from.  The food overall was mediocre, and the quality of their shashi was not very appetizing.  The whole experience at the restaurant was ok, it was around 6-7pm when the restaurant started getting busy. To order, you would have to get the busy servers attention and she'll take down your order. Very backwards system I would have to say. And I can tell the waiter was growing impatient waiting for us to give her our order. Which also lead them to miss some of our orders and they gave us food that we did not order.  I won't be coming back here.  P.s. They add a 10% service charge to the bill. It's mandatory."}
{"text":"They have a good variety of sushi and many japanese food :3   What i like:  - The sashimi was cut thick, ( i think it's pretty good)  - Their ice cream   What i dont really like:  - it's a little bit expensive lol  - washrooms aren't clean"}
{"text":"I have to write a review as I see a lot of people ripping on the \"lack\" of service. When we (bf & I) have a huge sushi craving, we always come here. I would say we come here at least once a month or two.   Honestly, I don't care for the service when I go to Yang's because they are one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants I've been to in Markham.   When you're hungry, you'll appreciate how quick the food comes to you and their selection of items are really good. The sushi is really good!!!   If you need to order, just flag a waiter down. Not a big deal. They're really quick and I never had an issue waiting too long for service. I just don't see how they are rude."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite local AYCE sushi restaurant b/c I enjoyed the food. Service was always hit or miss. But one dinner, their disgraceful customer service pushed me over the edge of no return.    I had previously written a review for this restaurant, but it is mysteriously gone. So now, I am writing it again.   _______________________________________________  The breaking point was when 2 waitresses mistreated my extended family and I during dinner.  They refused to serve 2 of our tables individually, and told us we had to order as one table. When she served the food, she would put all of the food on one table, requiring people from my table to walk over and pick up our dishes, and bring them back with us to our table. Ridiculous. I can't believe we tolerated this. After a few orders, she changed her mind and allowed our tables to order separately. How extremely frustrating.   Other times, we tried to get the waitresses' attention, but they would ignore us.   One of my adult cousins had to turn around and kneel from his seat to speak to a waitress while placing an order, because she would not stand next to our table. Another adult cousin went out of her way and practically left the table to find a wait staff to order from.   Mid-order, a waitress abruptly walked away from me and left our table. My uncle and I were shocked - I was still speaking, yet she turned her back on me and left!   I could go on... _________________________________________________  My family and I were very polite guests and we did not deserve this kind of treatment.  In fact, we reacted in kindness and tried to counteract the wait staff's inappropriate behaviour with good manners and gentle speech: WE were the ones accommodating the staff.    I will never make the mistake of recommending this restaurant again.  ____________________________________________________"}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 5 times by now and I honestly don't understand the bad reviews. The food tastes very fresh. I mean, right as you walk in, you can see the chefs making the sushi. I've never had to wait for a table. Right as me and my family walk in, we're always seated right away. We've been here so many times that we already have our usual orders written out on our phones. Great value for dinner and lunch. Service is very fast and I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes until my orders come. As soon as any plates are empty, another server is ready to take it off our take to leave more space for the coming dishes. The food is very delicious. I have a sweet tooth so the highlight from that restaurant for me was the Mango Pudding. Oh my goodness! It is so delicious! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"AVOID WEEKENDS AND BUSY DINNER TIMES!!!  Not enough room to stand and wait for your table.  The servers kept cutting through from one end to the other without being polite at all and without the care in the world if they spilled something on you.  Waited to be seated for about 30 minutes even though they said it would be a 10-15 minutes wait.  Once seated, our waitress (didn't catch her name) took our order at the same time she took the couple sitting beside ours.  We felt very rushed as she took our order and asked for a sprite and a coke lastly.  The couple next to us seemed to get their food and drinks on time.  We asked our server for drinks and the status of our food.  She said she was going to look into it.  Waited another 15 minutes without any confirmation or a status or arrival of any meals.  We asked for the status with another waitress and she came back with our drinks and a bowl of rice but without our sushi.  Again, we asked our waitress for food with no reply at all.  After 40 minutes of waiting for our first order which still didn't arrive - my boyfriend and I decided to get up and leave the restaurant.  As we walked out our server thanked us for coming!  The servers sucked and their customer service was even more disappointing.  I wouldn't go to this restaurant on busy days, they might just forget about you! Doesn't seem that they care for your business unless you were their ethnicity.  Overall experience is very disappointing."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times lately and dare say the food is excellent and service is so much better.  Sushi and handrolls are done with care and taste great.  Steak skewers are so tender.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My family and friends LOVE this place and come quite often.  I can comfortably say I have been to Yang's at least twenty times.  That said, the experience is generally a hit or miss depending on the time/day you go.  Food Quality & Price: Family and friends find the quality of this AYCE restaurant great.  Personally, I find the quality of the fish it slightly better than average but nothing award-winning or anything that stands up above the rest.  The price is also very average for your typical AYCE LUNCH sushi buffet. The menu is sizable... but I really can't say anything more than it is just average to me. I never got food poisoning if that helps. DINNER on the other hand was a disaster.  NONE of the dinner items were worth the price.  Hokkaido scallops were full of mayo, beef sashimi was just ... sliced frozen beef (the sause had WAYYY too much ginger)... at $22 a pop, please avoid dinner here at all costs.   Facility: Located off HWY 7, it is pretty easy to find (intersection has traffic light) but parking can be very annoying.  It is in a plaza and parking is often full. Inside, the decor is ... okay, but I find washrooms to be dirty... and it doesn't help that the TILE  IS LIKE A MIRROR.  So if you are in one stall, you might as well wave to the person next to you with their pants down. Decor is mediocre...  Service: A few years ago, service was TERRIBLE, easily a 1.5/5. As others have mentioned, some servers avoid you like the plague, the run off as soon as they bring food, and it takes forever for them to notice you (even to give the check).  However, as of late, it seems that the service has stepped up a bit.  There are a few waiters that still do that, so it really depends on which waiter you get. Out of the 20+ times I've gone, I believe only 1 time was a blown away by service with speed and smiles. Food always arrives rather quickly, but table clearing not so much. But service at dinner is laughable. The waitress got our order wrong and forgot to replace it... we waited almost half an hour for our sashimi and only after we prompted them did they go and check. The only saving grace was a woman named Carmen. She took the reins and showed how important competence is in the restaurant business. Servers need to be trained better, perhaps Carmen can whip them all into shape?   Overall: I know it will not be the last time I eat at Yang's (I have no idea why my family and friends love it so much), but for the price, it seems like the \"default\" place to go. TVs are permanently on CHINESE television (Fairchild), so it really does NOT give even the remote image of being authentic Japanese. I am not sure how much more specific I can be in this review to describe Yang's lunch service other than... \"average\". Avoid dinner like the plague, so many other places to go to for Sushi dinner.  EDITED: We returned at a later date for lunch and was served by Carmen.  She was incredible.  If the rest of the staff were just like her, my rating for Yang's Kitchen would be an easy 3.5/5. She carries the entire floor and picks up everyone's slack.  It really seems like she's the only one working... if anything she really seems like the only person concerned with quality control at all.  Later Edit: I have come back to revise my review and bump my rating up to a 3/5. Since my last edit, I have gradually returned (at least 5 more times). The restaurant has been renovated and the menu updated.  I think that the someone from the staff does read the reviews here on Yelp since improvements have been made to some of the troubling parts of the establishment.  I cannot comment on dinner (since I have decided never to go back for dinner) but the new updated menu is great, sushi is fresh and appropriately sized, service is fast, plates are cleared and any concerns are taken care of immediately.  I continue to sing Carmen's praises, she works the floor SO efficiently it's like magic. The ONLY problem now is the mandatory 10% tipping on all bills. I understand including tip for large groups, but if you're going to include tip on the final bill, I probably won't leave you anything. It's a TIP for a reason and I probably would have left more if they hadn't taken the liberty to decide for me.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Definitely have the Salmon Rose/Sushi/Sashimi. Other great dishes \"Mango Roll (new!), \"Enoki Mushroom Beef Roll\" and \"Beef Tenderloin\"."}
{"text":"This AYCE used to be one of my favourites, however the quality of the service and food has declined a lot lately. After visiting the Yang's in Mississauga, I was hoping that this branch would be slightly better. For starters, it seems that all of their portions have gotten smaller. I know I can just order more, but the second problem was that food never reached us. I ordered three rolls, yet they all magically went to the table behind us, who had arrived 20 minutes after us. We asked one of the waiters, and she curtly said \"Maybe it's because they're frequent customers\" and walked away. Fine. We just ordered them again, and they came eventually...but the sashimi was not very fresh and some of the rice had a weird taste. Of course we just set aside some of the inedible rice, but the same lady walked by and demanded to know \"Why\" we didn't eat the rice. We explained it to her but again, she didn't do anything about it and just walked away. Lastly, it was not such a busy day, but we were told to make our last call after around an hour, and the bill was thrust upon us while we were still eating. I was extremely disappointed in their service and I would think twice before visiting this AYCE again."}
{"text":"This is the worst service I have ever received from a restaurant in my life. The waiter essentially took the food from underneath our mouths as they were rushing us out of the restaurant. All of a sudden, we hear a vacuum and to our surprise, the cleaning staff already started to clean the store. This was outrageous as the restaurant was still 30 minutes away from closing. As closing time approached, the waiter shoved the bills in our faces, even when our food wasn't finished yet. The bill also included tip, which the waiter did not inform us about. This was clearly a way to receive more tip than deserved. After the bills were collected, the waiter had the audacity to ask us to \"please try and finish the salmon, don't waste!\". It was hard to finish the salmon as their sushi chefs cut the fish in large portions. Sashimi is supposed to be enjoyed thinly sliced, not thick filet cuts. Their rolls also had too much rice, another tactic designed to make more money as the rice fills you up and as a result you eat less. I will never be returning to Yang's Kitchen ever again and I hope others looking at this review will do the same."}
{"text":"3.5  Not Japanese authentic, but for a Chinese run All you can eat Japanese Buffet food quality was good   Service: As soon as we sat down we were asked if we ready to order, never had a problem with service, it was prompt not warm/ friendly a 10% tip is automatically added to your bill  Food: Good varieties of maki rolls, appetizers, sashimi, teppanyaki AYCE  Done right: Salmon sashimi, right thickness  Pork Cutlet  Chicken Terriyaki  Dynamite Roll  Unique: Ramen offerings, not common at AYCE Beef Tataki Sold out of the scallop that night  Environment: Black leather surfaced seating, chrome steel legs, mix of booths and chairs, readily accommodate parties 2-6 or more, vibe dark interior, doesn't feel alive sorry the fake flowers don't help, Chinese variety show on the two TVs mounted  Cost: Dinner 24+tax + 10% service charge   Summary: cooked foods were excellent notable was the chicken terriyaki outside of the skin was left on and crisp to perfection, salmon sashimi fresh, maki/hand rolls were very good (not overly packed with rice, prepped well), disappointed there is no inclusion of red tuna sashimi even at dinner time, fast service"}
{"text":"I've tried a bunch of sushi around the GTA, and this place is probably in my top 3. The other reviews make it seem hit or miss, so what follows is my experience whenever going to Yangs for dinner or lunch AYCE.  Service is usually very good. I'm not of Asian descent, and I feel like in some other restaurants this seems to be a problem. In Yangs, they've always treated me exceptionally well. Seated promptly, and constant service. They are quick to remove finished places from the table, and quick to bring out new orders. Always with a smile :)  Food itself is very good. I've tried the menu extensively now, maki rolls, hand rolls, appetizers, teriyaki, noodles, and all sorts of other stuff. The dinner menu has an extra section with about 10 or so more items (more crab/seafood offerings if I remember correctly), but nothing above and beyond. The rolls come with good consistency and excellent  flavour for AYCE. I have never left here disappointed or dissatisfied, and I always recommend this place when people want sushi in Markham. Sure, it's not the authentic Japanese sushi as others have said, but again, the food tastes GREAT every single time! I love the spicy salmon, spicy crispy, crab rolls, and shrimp tempura. Never had a bad dish here, and we never leave left-overs!  Cost for dinner is about what you would expect (about $25), and lunch is a bit cheaper in the teens."}
{"text":"Horrible service and overpriced. Waited forever for our food and they always forget orders when they are busy. Food tastes decent but not amazing."}
{"text":"If I could give Yang's kitchen 0 stars I would.    Service was horrendous - 5 mins after our first order arrived the waitress told us to make our last order.  We were never warned when we first sat down, we felt so rushed to eat.  The staff turned off the music and TV then pulled out a vacuum despite saying there was no time limit.  Menu says 90 minutes, but apparently they tell you whatever to get you out the door.  The food presentation was quite nice and the taste was pretty good for AYCE sushi.... however my wife and I travel to a lot of places with questionable food standards which we're fine with, but the food at this place made us both sick.  Because we were rushed to last order we ordered a little too much and got lectured by the waitress for it.  They threatened us with extra charges for wasting food, I don't mind paying for wastage fees, but THREATENING a customer is ridiculous.  What started as a good experience went completely south.  We're never going there again and never recommending it to anybody."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT when it comes to their food however they have TERRIBLE service. The waitress makes you feel rushed and if they aren't doing anything they stand around your table and it just feels awkward.   Gave this place a 2 Star because of  the food but definitely ZERO for service."}
{"text":"Amazing food here. We did all you can eat and oh man , highly recommend grilled salmon sushi. So yummy. I also love their dessert. You gotta try their creme brûlée. In general good experience here. There was a bit of a wait before we were seated but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"One of the better all you can eat restaurants that I have been to.  Menus a little bit more extensive with other rolls such as the Hawaiian roll. Unfortunately I was unable to taste it because they were apparently out of stock. The outside throws you off with the interior of the restaurant is very nice looking."}
{"text":"Love this place but I agree with everyone about the bad service. Anyway I've come to expect bad service from just about every Asian establishment in T.O. The food is just too damn good here so I don't really care. The spicy salmon is heavenly and they give you gigantic salmon sashimi pieces. This place was my go-to for special occasions and I was very happy to be reunited with yang's during my visit back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Always had a good experience here. Food is great, they don't overload the sushi with rice like a lot of restaurants do and use large pieces of fish/filling. The quality of the food is amazing, the price had been going up ever since other restaurants have raised their prices. Being the same price as other restaurants I prefer this one specifically for the quality of the fish. Raw fish can be handled poorly and cause sickness/illness, this is why I have no worries going to Yang's because every plate of fish is fresh (as well as meat) and has no odour to it.   I have been going here since 2010!  I read a lot of reviews and many are quite ridiculous. This is a Japanese restaurant, it definitely doesn't appeal to most that aren't able to flag down waitresses. They don't check on you like many american restaurants, you have to raise you hand, look at them and get their attention! I wouldn't go to ANY asian restaurants if flagging down a waitress seems like a task to you haha! I also don't know anyone who is stingy enough to not tip, 10% is the standard tip for a restaurant which even saves you from tipping 15-20% like many people do."}
{"text":"Very well prepared sushi... I am sure it can be a bit more fresher...  Definitely going back..."}
{"text":"We were there mid Jun (weekday). It's not up to standard food quality comparing to their recently raised price. (kid over 8 $27.99!) Limited menu selection. Most common dishes like shrimp tempura (tiny and over fried); veg tempura (thick piece and very oily); steam egg (salty); Low grade beef short rib; sashimi (except salmon, all tiny piece like a loonie coin size); plus not clean table and floor...."}
{"text":"This is my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant in Markham. It has evolved from the place I would come to meet friends to the place I bring my parents to, and now most recently the place my parents took me and my bf to.  A couple of years ago I would have totally agreed that the service here was the worst. The amazing sushi kept me coming back, and those chefs just work wonders. Quick and efficient, delicious and fresh, I can't get enough. I have ZERO complaints about the food.  They've raised their prices quite a bit in a couple of years but still affordable and still worth it. Even the service has improved. It's not five star service but the annoyed look the servers gave when you want to place a second order is gone (or well hidden) and 1 out of 3-4 servers will actually smile at you! Go, eat, bring Cash and stretchy pants!"}
{"text":"The BEST for all you can eat sushi!  I know there are some haters out there about the service, and its true... some of the servers don't speak english which can be a little difficult. My best advice is to GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY -- just make sure you avoid going on the weekend or you're bound to have long waits, missing orders, and poor service! Weekdays are cheaper anyway =). The price is a little bit steep, but if you compare it to buffets like Mandarin, you're getting a lot more bang for your buck with all the meat and seafood you're gonna be getting. After tax and tip I think its about $27 on the weekday and maybe $30 on the weekend.  The best thing about this place is that just because it's all you can eat doesn't mean they load you with fillers like rice. You can also order a wide variety of sashimi which is not limited in any way.  Highly recommended dishes: Haikkado Scallap (not sure if its on the menu but they always have it) Salmon Tataki Beef Sashimi (though it comes frozen, its really delicious if you marinate it in the sauce it comes with until it softens) Beef Spare Ribs Green Dragon Roll Spicy Salmon Roll Soft Shell Crab Roll Seaweed Salad Shrimp Tempura"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places in the Toronto area.  I've been here several times and have always found it to be consistently good.  Service is what you expect from an Asian restaurant however tonight I found that it was quite good considering it was busy.    Some of my recommendations include,   Korean BBQ style short ribs Skewered steak Deep fried scallops Salmon Sashimi Spicy crispy rolls Steak and Chicken Teriyaki  Shrimp tempura Beef wrapped around Japanese mushrooms (sorry I can't remember the actual name for it)  and don't forget ice cream!!!!  Prices were reasonable except for when it comes to children.  Any kids who eat and who are 8 years or younger pay 8$!!!  Those with kids say around 2-5 years old may want to reconsider.    I've been a repeat customer and will continue to visit Yang's until I find another all you can eat sushi place to replace to take its place.    Pay cash and save 2$  The only piss off I will mention was they charged for a 2 year old daughter to eat.  The price was half however still considered expensive when you take into consideration how much really a 2 year old would eat."}
{"text":"Weekday dinner $23.99/ adult  Food was okay. Baked scallop ans eel pancake is only one per person.  Shrimp and king crab is weekend only.   Salmon tataki was basically cooked salmon with sauce and fried onion (more cooked then tataki should be).  Volcano roll is just deep fried Philadelphia roll.   The chawamushi steamed egg had a lot of good fillings.  Service was decent but DO NOT order from this chubby asian girl who never smiles and walks very slow. I'm not judging bit her service is slow and sloppy. Ordering from her you have to point at the menu, she has to look at It closely then slowly write it. I ordered 20 pcs sashimi, 2 came. I could have ordered 10 things with another server and she will still be reading and writing 2 items off the menu.  The salmon sashimi had some blood in it so that scared me.   The presentation of the steamed egg was poor as they left the wrapper on it.  You can get 10% off if paid by cash only from CCUE.  The place looks nicer and cleaner after renovation but still not my favorite AYCE in the area."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out this place for years but its notoriety as far as service goes always brought me to another AYCE. Seemed like the consensus was, good food, god awful service. Since I was running out of AYCE options,  I finally decided to try it at around 11:30am on a weekend, which is always a great time to avoid crowds in places like this so that I can focus solely on the food. When I got in, I got immediately greeted with a frown asking how big our party was. For the place to be less than half occupied at that time, I could imagine how terrible things could be if the servers had to do some actual work during rush hour. Everything was smooth sailing after we got our seats so no complaints for me so far.  First observation,  the selection is slightly more diverse than what I'm used to. They have ramen in the AYCE  menu which I have not seen anywhere.  It obviously wasn't great ramen but just having it in the menu makes me give them my thumbs up. The sushi selection was pretty standard and was pretty much the same as in any other AYCE. Seriously, how much fish quality can you get for a $15 buffet!?  I ended up ordering some grilled squid, fried salmon belly, oyakudon, and a lot more items that weren't sushi. This is probably the restaurant where I had the least number of sushi orders just because they had other stuff that seemed interesting. The food was good, not amazing, but that's pretty much the best I can expect from a sushi buffet.  Note: $15 price applies to cash payments."}
{"text":"I usually don't even write reviews because I simply just decide that I won't return and that's the end of the story, but I guess there's always a first for everything.  Yang's used to be the \"go-to\" AYCE spot my parents and I go to and through that, the owners know who we are, etc. In addition, there are some speciality items that they offer that other AYCE places don't.   However, there was one time that I went here with my friend and we usually come with an almost empty stomach and so we order and we can eat a lot. The owner came around, recognized me and takes our order. What appalled me the most was the fact that during the time we were ordering, she INTERRUPTED me and said that I was ordering a lot of food and started inquiring if my friend and I were able to finish it all.  First and foremost, even if you had any opinions on whether or not we could finish the food or not, do you ask all your customers that?? Is that even appropriate? This leads me to my second point: just because you are familiar with my family does not mean that you could speak to me in an informal manner. At the end of the day, I'm still a paying customer, just like any one else.  Needless to say, we ordered one round of food and dipped. Never returning to this place again and guess what? Neither are my family and friends.   If I could give this place 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write a review. I made reservations for 7pm on Saturday for 7 people and we weren't seated until 7:30.  I get it, it's a weekend, it's packed, you're super busy...but the purpose of making reservations is to avoid this situation and reserve the table 1 hour ahead or something. Or tip for u guys, just come 30 min early before your reservation time!  For 27.99 pp...I'm better off going somewhere else for better service and food quality. I wonder why people are stil going here? Food arrived quickly but a few orders are missed or they give you the wrong orders. For pop - you only get Coke or Sprite. Come on ..not even ice tea?!   Oh and saving the best for last...I got food poisoning when I got home :S  true story.  Must have been the FROZEN beef sashimi (oh wait I didn't eat that..) well it's something there for sure.  Food that tasted decent: seaweed salad, spicy salmon maki, steak, baked clam, and..that's it.  I'm trying kaka ayce next. Try to reserved there first but they were full."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Yangs for quite some time now. Parking lot always seems to be busy with patrons.   $24.99/adult for weeknight dinner.   Had a variety of things...   Sushimi came extremely quick and looked weird visually. Salmon was very dark orange. Too dark in fact, and when you bite into it, you realize it's extremely cold. If you had sensitive teeth, you'd be screaming in agony from it. Seems they pre-cut their sushimi and keep it on the cooler. Explains why it came so fast. This is the first time I've ever had it served like that. Not impressed at all.   Had a couple of different noodles. Size per was very small compared to other AYCEs. Spicy seafood noodle - was just the seafood noodle with a huge squirt is sriracha sauce. Again, not impressed.   Shrimp tempura were ok.  Onion tempura were too soggy.   Had the soft shell crab roll, California roll, volcano roll, scallop roll, and green dragon.  Pieces were not cut up evenly. Sizes of each piece was no where near uniform.  Almost like presentation didn't matter. Soft shell crap was disgusting. It had a itty bitty piece of crab and a whole lotta mayo. I'm not taking spicy mayo. I'm talking miracle whip, out the jar mayo. Seems they like to use it for a lot of things.   Ordered both the eel pancake & Hokkaiyaki scallop which was 1 per person limit. Pancake was ok. Wouldn't have ordered more even if I could. The scallop was nasty. Even worst than the crab roll. Basically a scoop of mayo (again not the spicy, but the jarred mayo) and a piece of scallop the size of my thumb nail. No, that's not an exaggeration, unfortunately. They mayo was very tangy. Also turned of you ask me. I just ate scallop, and even then I still had the tangy mayo taste so didn't really enjoy it.   Place seems needing a renovation. Booth was adequate for 2, but would be right for 4. Overall spacing was very cramped. Can walk down aisle 2-abreast. Washrooms looked stained & run down.   Overall service was ok. Nothing special/exceptional. It was quick, but that's probably because of the pre-cut sushimi and I'm sure they pre cook lots of their stuff too (soup noodle came out pretty fast too). Staff weren't too friendly. But that's probably cause they charge 10% gratuity on top of your total bill. It irks me when restaurants do this....even worst is they calculate it after taxes. So they are getting 10% of taxes too?   In the end, the experience is all based on whether you'd recommend or go back again; and safe to say I would do either."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. Was just there for dinner with a friend and we chose to order from the menu since we can't eat enough to make the all you can eat worth while.   I had ate there a few years ago and I don't remember it being so terrible. I can't even think of one good thing to say about the meal.   My friend ordered shrimp and veggie tempura and the shrimp tempura roll. I ordered the edemame and red dragon roll.  These are the issues we had : 1) edemame came over cooked and as a result had no flavour. 2)tempura came without the sauce so we asked for it and when it came it had chunks of food in it like it had already been used. And the vegetable tempura was not fresh. Looked like it was cooked once then refried again to warm it up. 3)then they brought green dragon roll instead of red dragon roll 4)when the red dragon roll came it had mayo in it. Never seen that and I always order red dragon roll and I don't like mayo.  5)the shrimp roll had  more crab in it then shrimp.  On top of all that the service was lousy and when we got our bills they had added a service charge to it. Overall a really unpleasant experience. Will not be eating here again and won't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today to try it out after reading reviews. The sushi came out quite fast and was actually pretty good. Not too much rice, okay quality. Basically your standard AYCE sushi.   The BIG ISSUE was the service! Came for the lunch special and felt rushed and was ignored several times. There was a slight sense of attitude from two of the waitresses, maybe a bad day? At the end one of us paid in cash we decided to leave a tip on top of the already included 10% service tip, but needed change. after waiting they told us we needed to go as lunch was over. so when we asked for the change  they said they charged us extra claiming we ordered things that we did not. After a short discussion they realized they were incorrect and tried to talk us into saying the change we left was a tip. Basically theft, which is a bit ridiculous.   Never coming back again thats for sure"}
{"text":"I should mention Im not a big fan of AYCE sushi. It's always poorer quality and you have to fight to catch the attention of your server. I find this place loud, they don't bring you what you order and the food is bland. A lot of better options in Markham if you avoid AYCE."}
{"text":"I have eaten dinner at Yang's a few times over the years, normally due to a family occasion. This place is just... OK. Based on my most recent visit (yesterday), it's just not a place I would get excited over.  I'll start with the positives. The venue is quite large, bright and seemed clean. The salmon sashimi cuts were thick and tasted fresh, as did the wasabi. Most of the food tasted good enough and the service wasn't too bad. Mind you, we had an early 6:30pm dinner so it wasn't hard to yank a waiter's/waitress' attention.   Now onto the not-so-impressives. The miso soup was lukewarm which made it kind of gross to me. The soft shell crab roll, which is my all-time favourite sushi, was a bit of a let down - it just didn't have the crunch or taste I like. They sat us in a corner table where several waiters and waitresses literally hovered and socialized which made it hard to enjoy my company and my dinner. The deep-fried banana was also lukewarm which made my boyfriend and I laugh quite hard at that point because really, why were we being served lukewarm food?   Overall, it wasn't too disappointing - filled us up just fine but it doesn't stand out in the crowd of AYCEs."}
{"text":"The food is definitely worthy of the INCONSISTENT services that you'll get.  While the food's served buffet style, one must order it A.S.A.P in order for the food to get there on time.  In short, here are the dishes to try: - Salmon (sashimi) -Shrimp tempura roll -Beef tenderloin -Short Ribs (korean bbq style) -Chicken Fried Rice  Again, food is good as long as you fore-go the expectation of getting good services."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner a few hours ago and food is Amazing as usual!  If you know what to order, you're in the right place.  Why I love this place is variety and there's a lot of tasty ones.  My usual are...  - Grilled Beef Ribs that melts in your mouth. - Enoki beef rolls that has a flavorful texture. - Surf clam, salmon, and white tuna sashimi cut to perfection. - Grilled egg plant cooked just right. - Grilled Squid made just right without tasting like rubber. - Teriyaki Salmon roll that has melted cheddar in the middle (odd at first but it has a good taste).  Tip is to order it early as it takes time to make and don't eat it right away.  It's really hot!  For a buffet, it's the best sushi place in the suburbs.  Can't argue with price which is favourable to my wallet.  I believe I took my girlfriend here for our second date and she's a fan!  When I asked her, she always have Yang on her mind.  If I can name one bad thing, it would be service.  Depending who you get, you might have to repeat yourself or orders never show up.  One incident was when they were out of white tuna, they didn't even let us know until I asked.  It needs improvement but the staff does look over work.  Tip:  Remember to take cash as there's a discount.  If you're using credit, it's regular price."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but I have to say the service could use some improvement. Our night started out really good. We had come for dinner and with empty stomaches growling, we were definitely happy to have been seated quickly.  Our server was really fast in taking our orders which was great. To be honest, everything was fine during the first part of our meal. We ordered, the food came and we ate. Some things were better than others but I was satisfied with the quality of the sashimi.   However, my experience at Yang's was quickly tainted when I was asked to pay my bill at the same time the table next to mine was paying. Keep in mind they were there before us and we had just sat down less than 45 minutes ago. Following that, I was asked to quickly finish my meal so they could put the two tables together to serve a party of 8 who had not made reservations. The server who had approached us about our bill hadn't apologized or even conveyed her message in a polite way.   I have no qualms paying my bill and finishing my meal swiftly if I was sitting in a reserved spot. However, I was not in a reserved seating and the table of 8 had only just shown up 2 minutes before I was asked to pay and leave. As we were leaving, we saw there were plenty of other spots that a table of 8 could have fit.   So, no matter how good my meal was, I left Yang's with a sour taste in my mouth. We may have been a table for 2 but that doesn't mean we should be rushed and shooed for a table of 8."}
{"text":"If you ever wanna go somewhere that has a bunch of people who hate their jobs, this is where you want to go! Not a single smile on any of the staff the entire night I was there! I also feel that the prices have gone up recently, as I went in on a weeknight and I felt I was paying a fortune! At $23.99 before tips & tax, that's getting a bit much on a weeknight, even for AYCE.   Even so, it was surprisingly busy on a Wednesday night, and we had to wait a bit for a table. Upon our arrival, we were told to wait multiple times for a table by different staff. Seemed a little annoying being told that many times and probably should have 1 person as a host, rather than 2-3. When we got seated, our dishes were dirty and couldn't get anyone's attention to replace it. Definitely not a good start to the dinner.   We started ordering and getting our food, but was a bit hard to see if the servers understood what we were saying. No responses or reactions when taking our orders, we had to repeat ourselves in which case made them question our orders. When they brought us our food, they practically threw the dishes on our table! They even had dishes stacked on top of food on other plates while carrying them to the tables! Definitely not hygienic at all!   The only redeeming factor was that some dishes were quite good. The Beef Sashimi was decent, the sashimi were good overall, and the teriyaki foods were good too. I would say they got the 1 star for just the food itself.   Service is definitely not the best here. Felt like the staff were constantly annoyed and hated serving their customers. There are definitely much better AYCE Japanese restaurants in the neighbourhood. I would highly recommend going elsewhere. (PS: they seem to include tip here, so don't tip on top when paying!)"}
{"text":"Yang's is going down.In the past month I was there twice and things are not looking good.  The Salmon Rose are not the way it used to be. The miso soup is always cold and the worse of all is the attitude of the servers. This place is not my favorite Sushi place and I would not come back here for good."}
{"text":"Poor service. I asked for 3 pieces of the fish because we were 3 people. They brought it burnt and it had a sour taste to it so we didn't finish it. The woman said in Chinese \"look at them wasting the fish\" and when we were about to pay she wanted to charge us for it. The food later on gave us food poisoning too. My second time trying this place but I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Worst AYCE place I've been to.  Went once with a group of 4 but was seated at a table meant for 2.  Food quality was below average and the service was horribly slow.  What ticked me off is that they kicked us out for reaching the time limit (I think it was 1 hour) even though we spent about as much time eating as trying to flag a server down and waiting for food.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Gorging on raw and cooked fish, tempura, udon, rice and an wide assortment of other Japanese foods is something I try to do less often nowadays than I did 5-10 years ago, but something I enjoy nonetheless.   As far as AYCE sushi spots go in Markham, this is one of the better ones because of the large variety of dishes. Quality is at or above par as other AYCE sushi establishments.  Sushi on 7 (across the street) is pretty good as well, but seating is limited there so you'll have an easier time finding a table at Yang's on a weekend.  What sets Yang's apart is that Yang's has a greater number and variety of dishes at Yang's than other AYCE sushi places, including a about 12-16 items from the grill such as salmon belly, salmon head, mackerel, sole filets and have some items such as salmon tataki, beef tataki and eel pancake that other AYCE sushi places don't have.    The sushi is good, I've only had one or two experiences in the many times I've gone here where the sushi was still really cold.  Considering how busy they are they get food out to you quickly.  Do be warned that they seem to run out of some items later at night, this past weekend they were out of seaweed salad and steamed egg.   They have an assortment of ramen, udon and fried rices as well.   Desserts are your typical AYCE fare of ice cream and fried banana (which aren't very good, but there aren't many AYCE places with good friend banana anyway).   It's about $29 (tip and tax included) for dinner on a weekend, and I think about $26 on a weekday.  My favorite AYCE sushi shop is still Prince sushi in Mississauga, but this Yang's a good choice if you're in the north east end of the GTA."}
{"text":"By far the BEST sushi quality than any other ayce place  The appetizers r pretty good  The service is alright  But in terms of sushi, best best quality. Loooove it"}
{"text":"I have been to Yang's Sushi Bar Japanese Restaurant (??????) (also known as Yang's Kitchen or Yang's Kitchen & Sushi Bar) many times for dinner and lunch.  This was my second time having their lunch buffet.  Yang's Sushi Bar Japanese Restaurant is a Japanese restaurant that serves all-you-can-eat items during lunch or dinner.  I believe they also have an a la carte menu too.  We arrived a few minutes after 11 a.m. since that was when they opened for business.  There were already some other customers ahead of us; I guess they had been awaiting the opening too.  The selection of items on their lunch buffet is reasonable.  The lunch buffet currently stands at $17.99 at the time of posting.  (Previously, it used to cost $16.99, $15.99, etc. but obviously with the changing economy, they have gradually increased their prices.)  We ordered about two rounds of food.  I liked the food!  They have more items and actual sashimi during their dinner service (since the price is higher than for lunch).  The service was actually really fast here.  Very soon after we placed our order, our items came in and nothing was missed from the list."}
{"text":"I like this AYCE better than most I have been to.  I prefer this better than Sushi on 7 because it is more spacious and the food is better in quality.  The shrimp tempuras are the best I have tasted in all the AYCE I ever had.    My only bad experiences here was on Mother's Day when a lot of our orders were missed (about 10 approximately) and if you go in the evening about an hour BEFORE closing, they don't have green dragon roll.  Other than that, the sashimi are fresh, shrimp tempuras tastes actually like shrimp, the grilled squid skewers are one of my favourite, dynamite roll, spider roll, green dragon roll, enoki beef and grilled salmon are all really delicious.  This has been our place to visit for sushi if we decide for AYCE!!!"}
{"text":"Family of 5 Repeat guest of this  AYCE sushi and tons of varieties   Lady owner is always tentative and accommodates all your requests   This place is also good to eat with young kids as they have high chairs and accomadating space   Our favourites:  Steam eggs Smoked salmon sushi Steak   * portions are big - make sure you order accordingly"}
{"text":"My go-to AYCE sushi place! I live in Scarborough, but am willing to drive up to markham when craving good sushi. I usually take my boyfriend here when he's in town and there's no doubt that we love this place.  What I love about Yang Yang's Kitchen: - Service is always quick - Large portion sashimi servings - Red Tuna sashimi - Friendly Staff  - Great Variety on the menu (lots of options) - Cold Soba Noodles - Decent size of a restaurant"}
{"text":"Best deal around for lunch, I've been coming to Yang's from downtown for the past 10 years. Sure, the service is curt but it's efficient and all I'm really there for is the food. Green dragon rolls are easily the highlight, along with the marinated beef ribs and the shrimp tempura is pretty good too. If they ever take green dragon rolls off the lunch menu, I might just start a riot."}
{"text":"If it wasn't the service that was good this place would be a 1 star. The fish belly was fried. The sashimi was not fresh. The dish and plate didn't feel clean. The crab leg was a joke and I'm not even going to mention it. The clam same thing. A tiny whatever with mayo sauce heated. The ginger milk look disgusting."}
{"text":"Oh Yang's Kitchen, your service is terrible but the food well its not great but its all you can eat. This is probably the best asian all you can eat restaurant I have every had the pleasure eating at. This restaurant is best enjoyed with a group of frineds who just want to pig out. I love this place so many fond memories if  I were in toronto right now I probably would be eating there tonight."}
{"text":"We were there last night for dinner on Civic Monday holiday. It was quite busy on the one side of the restaurant.  The servers appear to be very busy attending all the other tables ordering AYCE. I was having dinner with my BF and we both ordered the dinner bento box combos. I had the chicken teriyaki (Combo B)  and he had (Combo D) with eel ???. When we received our miso soup it was announced to us by the young male server that we will not get our salad. The salad that is provided with the combo. I had asked to clarify if they will be making more later or we will not get salad at all. The server did not have an answer and was very confused when looking at us walking away.  The bento box combo was below average taste of the meat. Also one of the sections on the box was generously filled with lots of bean sprouts. The \"shrimp\" tempura was two pieces and mix of other veggies. The chicken was dry with old fatty pieces. The rice was dry and day old stale texture. The only positive side of my meal is the tasty miso soup and mango ice cream. In addition to my food review the automatic 10% tip on my bill for a la carte order. I was so disappointed that I walked out of there feeling ripped off for my $16.99 dinner and paid cash for exact rounded closest to total on bill."}
{"text":"Such a hit and miss here. I've been many times for lunch and dinner, weekends and weekdays. There have been times when I've asked for the same thing 5 times and not gotten it. Why do I keep coming back? They're cheap. They leave you alone to hang out (maybe that's the problem). And, they serve decent, not super fantastic, sushi."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for many years.  The food is actually pretty decent - sushi and other main dishes. The problem with this place is their service.  Some waiters/waitresses does not really speak English and this can make things difficult.  Sometimes the food that we order never comes so we have to ask them."}
{"text":"We have been customers for a long time.  Lots of reviews about poor service but we never experienced it.  Great deal for lunch - we love the chicken skewers, salmon rose,  chicken wings, beef ribs, rainbow and green dragon rolls. Good quality shrimp for tempura.  Don't remember ever ordering veggies or noodles though - we stick to sushi and protein.  Never had any issues with waitstaff or service.  Love the eel handrolls and spicy salmon handrolls.  We have tried other AYCE places to see what all the fuss is about - but this one is still the best for cooked foods and premium rolls.  Food comes super fast.  Not attentive service but definitely efficient.  They get you in and out of there fast.  We go there for dinner as well.  No hassles when we order multiple rounds of sashimi.  They now have sweet shrimp sashimi at dinner.  And have added new dessert offerings although we are not too crazy about the ginger milk dessert - very gingery but not creamy enough.    Definitely our go-to place for AYCE - remember to use 10% off coupon from ccue or chinese newspaper."}
{"text":"I used to go to another AYCE almost across the street - it was too busy with a big wait time, so my hubby & decided to check out Yang's. It came highly recommended.  I love sushi, i could it eat it every day if i could. I settle for 1-2 times a week.  There wasn't 1 thing I liked about this place.  Service was bad - rude & ignored us for the most part. Didn't come around often to our table. No ice for the soft drinks, sushi & rolls had too much rice and not even visually appealing or appetizing. I was actually smelling the fish before eating it - never done that ever at a restaurant. Wasn't a fan of any of their hot foods either. Asian fusion = Chinese style Japanese food. Gross and nothing stood out except for unappetizing food.  Will not go back - and in case you're wondering. I don't even go to the place across the street anymore. Much better Japanese restaurants in Unionville & Markham now."}
{"text":"Been to Yang's Kitchen maybe about 7 years ago and the place was bustling and remembered it be be pretty good. Perhaps it was nostalgia or hunger that made me choose to return here despite the many other AYCE selections in the area.   I immediately got worried the place was half empty on a Friday night I march, but decided to march on.  Food: 0 stars Sashimi (salmon, butter fish, hokkigai, octopus, and shrimp) were visually lacklustre. Fresh fish should be brightly coloured but these ones were not. Crab leg was featured to be only available on weekend dinners, and that was merely eating cold, boiled crab and it was a slight upgrade from eating imitation crab meat. I pitied the crab that died in vain only to be cooked and prepared this way. The salmon was the only sashimi that we ordered again.  Grilled: 1 stars Really disappointed that all items have been pre-fried, and grilled for merely a minute or two on an actual grill. Beef tenderloin was pretty good except the rather too salty seasoning. Chicken wings was passable but definitely leaned more towards eating fried chicken. The salmon belly was horrendous, dry and salty. The fact that the salmon was dry hinted the fact that this was not fresh and perhaps even re-fried or recycled.  Other food: 1 star  Fried cheese wonton: greasy, thin and pale wontons that wrapped a tiny portion of semi-dried our cram cheese. Beef sashimi: served frozen on a bed of raw onions and more ice cubes. Did they expect you to eat raw beef that looked like it was meant to be used for hot pot? Osaka Noodle: passable. Soup base tasted like a fish broth, with over cooked ramen noodles and pork chashu. The pork was good, but cooked Chinese style (reminded me of the Taiwanese style braised pork used in pork buns). Hokkaido scallop: served on a fancy shell, it looked a lot better than it tasted. The scallop definitely tasted something like it came out of a frozen bag, followed in mayo, sprinkled with garlic salt, baked and served.  Dessert: 3 stars Green tea ice cream was the best part of the meal. Can't go wrong with that.  Service: 2 stars No ones looked like they wanted to be there. I asked about the different between their various noodle selection particularly ones named after Japanese cities (Osaka, Fukuoka, Hokkaido) and the response I get was the meat is the same and soup base is different. I dared not ask further what the soup variances were. Honestly felt like whatever soup I picked they could've just given me any one since no one would really know the difference.  I've been to various AYCE (Japanese) in Vancouver (Richmond, Burnaby, and Vancouver) and Toronto (both uptown and downtown) over the years ranging from cheap, affordable and higher end.  This was the worst AYCE I've been to. Ever. Because of every single food item I tried was just not good. Instead of the goal of satisfying one's hunger, our goal quickly turned into getting through  the meal without getting sick. I tried ordering other items on the menu to hopefully find a hidden gem of a food item, only to get more disappointed with what came out. My friend just completely gave up (despite me knowing he wasn't full).  I was surprised Yelp ratings were much higher than this review that I felt compelled to write one to warn others of this recent experience. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I use to like going to this place when visiting relatives near the area. Now it's changed so much. I think the quality has gone way down and the service is meh, had to call staff multiple times for just water or extra ginger. They don't even have order sheets for you to fill out on your own, you have to call someone over.   Menu prices have gone up with for no discount for seniors during lunch. No fried banana for dessert (only ice cream) and lunch service ends earlier then most other AYCE sushi places.   Can't recommend this resto unless they start serving better sushi. They clearly are cutting corners and it shows. Sorry but for anyone who thinks this is a good sushi place, try Heart Sushi (not the best but good, steps above this one) or even Japango (delish but non-ayce place)."}
{"text":"generally they have really good food but when they get really busy, the food comes out hella slow (and when you ask the servers for them to arrive faster, they can get a bit rude) and also they might not too taste well.. so just a little tip, don't go there when it's the holidays   **their hokkaido scallops are to die for (only available at dinner time though)"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever, not even among japonaise ones.. worst I ever gone in my life.Everything tasted terrible... I wondered how they could male even simplest and popular foods so bad.... how can they make cream brûlé so terrible?!!!! That needs a special skill !!!shrimp Tempura awful.... cutlets awful....see weed salad old and awful as well.... fried rice was not fried more than 10 seconds it tasted the worst rice ever.... chicken and beef skewers awful.... salmon old , smelled terrible.... and you can see how dirty it is.... flies everywhere..... and the service is also poor.... careless waiter and they charge you their tip with this poor service.... no opinion for not being unsatisfied.... NEVER EVER TRY IT... That's my honest and caring advice for you"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from a co-worker and my gf, Yang's Kitchen has been here for YEARS...for a restaurant to be located in the corner of a plaza and still be in business is impressive. Parking is ample, however on a busy night be prepared to keep looking.  The venue itself is very spacious with plenty of tables and booths to accommodate large parties.   Coming here for dinner (25.99/pp)....though this is a bit pricey for a Mon-Thursday price they've got a wide variety to choose from, even for those who are not sushi fans, there's plenty of meat options as well.   ***Please also NOTE that they do add %10 on top of your final bill so be aware when your tipping.... Below are some of a dishes we tried and we enjoyed!  California Roll Green Dragon Black pepper beef with garlic Beef short ribs Mango rice paper sushi Blackened cod Salmon sushi (torched) Miso soup Spicy salmon maki Steamed egg Beef sashimi Salmon/ octopus sashimi Hokkaido scallop"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, groups up to 4 people. I never make reservations but am always seated right away. The service is fast! Once you order, the food (likely made in huge batches) comes out right away. They have lots of variety on the menu, but the food doesn't always taste fresh.  For two people, we paid about $64 for a weekday dinner. You should note that they automatically add a service charge on the bill (10%), but don't tell you that it's already there. The credit/debit machine still asks if you would like to tip."}
{"text":"Quality: 3.5-4.5/5, has decreased a bit and the price has increased over time.  Quantity: sit down all you can eat restaurant. Roughly $15 lunch-$25 dinner and TIP is Included. Good or bad. See below.  Service: variable. Some days its terrible some days very good. Depends on how busy it is. I suggest ordering a mass amount of what you like to start so you get it all... As trying to get the waitress again could be a challenge. Go when you have time and you're not in a rush.  They've upgraded some of the features but dont expect fancy.  I love the place. Been going here for a couple years at least. Sit down and order off the menu. All you can eat. How can you not be satisfied? Lol Sashimi and fried banana are for dinner only.  Spicy salmon, salmon sushi, green dragon roll. Salmon sashimi. Osaka fried rice, fried udon. Tempura... Soo good. They also have hot dishes for any friends scared of sushi. Garlic beef is delicious. Beef short ribs. One of my fave restaurants."}
{"text":"Bad service but excellent sushi and sashimi. Their beef sashimi is to die for and I drive an hour here just to have it. Seriously. Try it. I get three boats worth. Their regular sashimi is amazing too. I've been coming here for at least 5 years now!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for the price of $30ish after service fee and the tax. A bit too greasy and salty for my taste though. I loved their Hokkaido Scallop and Chawamushi Steam Egg, so a strong recommendation on those two.   However, their service still hasn't improved since the last three times I had visited this place. My dad was asking, with a smile, in a kind manner, if he could have half a bowl of noodles instead of an entire bowl, the server, interrupted my dad RUDELY and raised his voice with a very harsh tone, \"NO, ONE BOWL IS ONE BOWL, JUST ONE NO HALF\". Like lmao chill, could've at least been nice about it or pretend to offer to ask the kitchen about it. He was the same server that served us during our last three visits with the same old crappy attitude. He might've been too tired or just having a bad day but really? The same terrible service for four visits in a row? I've been working 46.5 hours the past four days with only 10 hours of sleep but I don't yell at my customers like that? Especially when the customer is being friendly and nice? I find it extremely rude and unacceptable. It's not even the first time that it's happened. My dad doesn't mind it but it hurts me to see him getting practically yelled at just because he wanted half a bowl of noodles. Pretty ridiculous in my opinion. BTWS we actually did get half a bowl of noodles during our last visit because a female server said it was possible. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a time where the service at a restaurant just makes you never wanting to come back to the restaurant, yet the food is just impeccable (and by that, I mean that it's probably one of the best sushi places I've had in Markham.. yet will never compare to Vancouver).  I have a love-hate relationship with Yang's Kitchen! The staff always seem annoyed, uninterested and fed up, but it's an all-you-can eat restaurant... how else am I going to get my food? I've read once about the manager attacking a customer due to some payment/ receipt issues.. and they do not always honour the 10% discount they advertise in the Chinese newspaper, learned from experience with my own family.  My suggestion - go with a big group of people.... and order anything you want. I have no complaints about their food so I'll still go back for good company."}
{"text":"The prices here for AYCE are a bit expensive but Yang's Kitchen remains one of my favorite AYCE places in Toronto! The food never disappoints, my favorites being the beef teriyaki/steak options. They don't have iPads to order food off of but it shouldn't be much of a hindrance... if you've ever ordered food at a restaurant before anyway. All the food I ordered came on time and I finished dinner as a satisfied (and insanely full) customer : )"}
{"text":"Ok price, decent selection, decent food, but horrible horrible service, very mean and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"NOPE. Either the food and service fell off significantly from my first visit, or the novelty (and more likely the fact that I was hungover and hungry for anything at the time) heavily influenced my opinion of this place.  I guess I can start with the good: Shrimp tempura, kalbi, futomaki, and ice cream were on point. That's it.  Onto the negatives... where to begin? Servers went out of their way to ignore you. No, really, they would grab your empty plates and run as fast as humanly possible before you could get their attention. And when they walk by your table they will have tunnel vision or stare at the ground even if they see you in their peripheral looking, waving, doing backflips, etc. Food took forever to arrive. You don't get spoons with your soup or ginger with your sushi. Hot tea tasted like bitter pee. I don't know, it was funky and sour and bright yellow and oily(?). Several ordered items never arrived and had to be ordered twice. Miso soup was all salt. The avocado on my green dragon roll was extremely mushy and ruined the entire roll. Old, soggy shrimp tempura in the shrimp tempura roll. Towards the end of my meal I contemplated whether I should tough it out and get my money's worth or just put up the white flag. In the end I gave up and made my own personal history by leaving an AYCE for the first time ever without being stupid full to the point of having to harness all the energy in my body just to keep it from spewing from all orifices of my body.  The overall quality of the food was not as good as I remembered and fell more in line with cheap buffet food, which to me actually isn't bad, but I feel like this was much worse than that.   I'm not writing the place off completely. I mean, it is bad, but it can suffice as that hangover cure kind of bad where you just have to eat something cheap, plentiful, and awful to hit the spot."}
{"text":"Japanese all-you-can-eat places have been sprouting out like crazy for the past little while and I guess it's pretty hard to find a good place now a days.  It's almost a crap shoot now a days because you can either find something decent or you can fall really, really short.    Yang's is chinese owned and run, I guess that's pretty important sometimes to show how legit a restaurant is.  The place is usually jammed most of the time which I guess shows how good the place is.    A thing I really like about Yangs is that they have a decent sushi and sashimi selection.  The fish is usually pretty fresh and you get a generous portion of it (unlike the razor thin portions some places do).  Their special rolls are so-so, and their sushi is alright as well.  One thing I appreciate that they have is the salmon roe sushi (which I like a lot).  I personally think their sushi rice needs a bit of work though.  I know it's an all-you-can-eat quality, but I really dislike the hard rice which I've gotten some times.  The rest of the menu Items are pretty decent as well.  The dishes themselves are pretty generic, but what sets Yang's apart is their grilled fish and ramen.  If you actually are into it, you can get a grilled salmon head (or any other part for that matter), as well as grilled mackerel.  These are pretty good to get your slow snacking on (cause they love it when you stay long =/).  I found it's pretty hard to find a all-you-can-eat place that will actually serves stuff like this.  Now ramen... I've had hit and miss with the ramen here.  I've had ones that were alright and ones that were pretty craptastic.  Either way, I like having something warming go down so I usually order it anyways.  It's not the best ramen, but at least I can keep ordering it.  Yang's isn't the best all-you-can-eat japanese restaurant I've been to, but it is one of the best ones around the area (geez, are we really stuck with this?).  Would I come back?  Probably if I have a hankering for some sushi."}
{"text":"Speed read: Typical Ayce Japanese food Average quality Above average price One dish of raw, cooked scallop included Drink included.  Please tell me if you like or hate my review :)  To be perfectly honest, I didn't find much here that I would especially highlight. This restaurant has been here for a long time.  While other AYCE restaurant has move ahead and make some innovation to differentiate themselves, this one has not move on much.  The raw dish is typical of AYCE. The cooked dish is too over powering with sauce, and the sauce tend to be too much on the sweet side.  On the good side, it's not very busy and finding a seat for a large group is not that hard.  Plenty of parking.  Service is so so.  If you read it this far, here is a tip.  Tip: Ordering system is description based.  You basically tell the server what you want and they will write it down.  DO NOT give them numbers on the menu, they will not accept that. IPAD has been out for 10 years....I suggest they start investing in some convenient technology."}
{"text":"Came here with Sharon C. for lunch. Hadn't been here in a very long time. Things have changed, the decor is much different, however it seems like they have some sort of paper just stapled to the wall, instead of a \"proper\" new design.  I was greeted on the way in but found that a lot of the plates could be much more clean, which kind of pissed me off. Upon ordering, we noticed that this restaurant hasn't upgraded their ordering system (iPad) -- the food was average, it wasn't bad at all. The only issue is the same issue I've experienced here before, they messed up a couple of orders with respect to quantity. The beef short ribs were cooked perfectly!  The good thing about this place and probably most of Markham and Richmond Hill - is the soft drinks are included in the price. The bad is that despite the fact you might have bad service, there's a mandatory tip fee that still exists from when they first opened.  I'm guessing this place is really hit or miss, I wouldn't return for at least another couple of years LOLOL.  2.5/5"}
{"text":"Brutal customer service. If you don't speak Japanese, you basically get ignored. Food was ok, but nothing special. Wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"I love Yangs yet I always have the same complaint. When I order premium items they are forgotten. It's very frustrating. However I will say that all the food there is very delicious and the service is great other than the missed items.   I highly recommend all the beef items and the rolls are fantastic.  The sushi pizza is also exquisite."}
{"text":"It's friday night and I was in Markham around the gf's siblings and figure we would go out for dinner. My problem with Markham is the lack of diversity of food which didn't really bug me in the past, but recently, I'm finding myself getting tired of the same Chinese imitation of all other Asian cultures. These are the numerous Chinese ran thai/viet/jap restaurants that claim authenticity, but the only that is authentic is their name. Yang, was one those ayce sushi places that was far from authentic. Even their name didn't seem Japanese. I might be wrong though. My first impression was not really that good. Decor was plain, and the seat I first sat on was broken. Made me feel like I was 10 as it sunk my rear end 2 feet from the ground. Reminded me of Pai which seems to be a recurring feeling. :S   We ordered the food and the best surprise came from the food. I have to say that I didn't have that much expectation, but after having my first taste of salmon sashimi, I was pleasantly surprised. It was glistening of freshness and quite savoury. The rolls weren't that good, but the meats were yummy. Beef short ribs(not fatty), Black Cod, Chicken kidney, Sirloin skewers, cuttle fish were all hits in my opinion. I'm still dreaming how good the sirloin were.  Beef sashimi was disappointing. Not as good as some people described it in yelp. The special scallops were ok. Nothing special. Same with eel pizza. Desserts were good. Had the red bean ice cream, mango yogurt and creme brulee. All were yummy, but I wouldn't say they are amazing.  Overall, for an ayce, Yang has some items that will make me come back over and over again. Hockey used to be my main ayce, but after having those sirloin skewers and beef short ribs, I will have to say Yang has taken over."}
{"text":"First, there was lots of parking so we didn't have to fight for a spot, which is lovely!  We entered and was quickly seated for 2. The place is gigantic! It could seat 100 people or more.  We had the all you can eat and we were not dissappointed. It was our first time here, but let you warn you. If you don't like salty or greasy you won't like this place. However for me, I love both so we were happy.  We ate an assortment of yummyness from fried foods to sushi. Everything I tasted was just so mouth watering good! They also had a dinner special where you get a crab leg and a scallop (1per person).  I ate so much food but I couldn't leave without the desserts. They had so many different types and it was all mind blowing.   After foodgasming because of the creme brulee and ice cream mixed with my bananas we got the bill for about ($75 for both with the tip already automatically included)."}
{"text":"We used to go to Yang's back in the day and it was competitive. It's been around for ages. But with new AYCE places around, it just seems outdated.  The interior has not been renovated in quite a few years it feels like. However, I've always liked their seating arrangement because most tables have comfortable booth seating and you have a sense of privacy vs. the chaos of other places. Then again, is this good for business if you feel like you can go to a quiet AYCE? It was quiet on a Saturday night.  Their menu has not changed in years either it seems - they still use laminated paper menus that look really worn and are a bit grimy/sticky feeling - not a good impression vs. the slick iPad ordering that many AYCEs have these days.  Service is not as good as it used to be - know that Yang's is and as far as I know has always been run by Chinese people. So we thought that ordering in Chinese was our best bet, however, she replied to us in English and so we completed our orders in English... it was a bit confusing and we were never sure if she really understood us because they kept cutting our orders. We asked for enough sashimi for 8 people and they literally gave us 8 pieces of each type of sashimi. Plus these sashimi pieces were TINY. If you thought Kiku gave tiny slices I could have probably put 5 of these in my mouth at once. As for quality it was okay. Not the freshest. But it's AYCE. We also asked for a pitcher of water just to save effort and they gave us 8 cups of water. We asked for 20 pieces of tempura (divide by 8 people and it's not unreasonable) and they gave us much less.  Quality of cooked food was fine and the rolls had a good rice to ingredient ratio. A lot of rice in the nigiri though.  Gratuity was included for our group and came out to $38. Absolutely not worth it considering all the other options out there... I'd rather go to Kiku."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a weekday. They were understaffed so it took some time to put in the orders. Unlike many AYCE places, this restaurant still requires servers to put in your order instead of ordering on an iPad. Once the orders were in, it didn't take too long for the food to arrive. Food tasted okay but there were not enough choices. Interiors decor was just nah, it looks quite old. I would return only if I want the really basic foods of AYCE. The lady owner (I assume she's the owner) was friendly and apologized in the end for the slow service."}
{"text":"Best Atmosphere Best fresh sushi Great service I try different AYCE sushi in Toronto and honestly this is the best sushi place that everyone have to try it. However, My mother and my friend hate sushi according to their bad experience in different sushi places. But they love sushi after they try yang yangs kitchen sushi"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place quite a bit about 5-7 years ago.  After a while, the service was just so bad that my friends and I stopped going and we discovered that more and more sushi AYCE restaurants were opening in the city.  This weekend, I went back there again and although it feels like the decor is still the same, I had noticed that they had changed the chairs and seating.  The place itself is just as spacious as I remember as well (quite a bit of seating available).  The food options were quite abundant and I never get to try EVERYTHING I want to try at an AYCE restaurant because I usually end up being too full!  The service was good up until it got a bit busier.  I think if you go at around 5:30-6pm, it's not as packed and the waiters/waitresses are much nicer because they're not running around the whole restaurant serving food and constantly taking orders.  We had ordered three times including dessert, and the food came to our table fairly quickly.  Again, it's probably because we got there at 5:45pm.  However, they did forget my fried scallop dish, but I'm not that surprised because something always tends to be left out/forgotten when AYCE orders are taken.  It's okay though because I was already stuffed by the time I realized that the scallops hadn't made it to our table!  Overall, I'm glad that I came back to visit this place again.  The only other issue I had was that it was $22.99 for dinner on weekends, which was slightly more than other sushi AYCE restaurants.  I'm not sure I'd visit again soon though because I'm sure that I can find a cheaper AYCE restaurant with food that's just as good. I might visit again after trying a few more different AYCE places."}
{"text":"I always go to this sushi place. They have really good salmon rose rolls, green + black dragon rolls and scallops. Although they are lacking a bit of creativity in terms of special rolls, I still give them credit for having an array of different appetizers/sides.  A couple years back when I first discovered this place, I discovered a piece of hair under my sushi. It was very displeasing. But after that experience, I still came back and I haven't discovered any hair in my food. Hopefully it doesn't happen to anyone else."}
{"text":"Is it just me or are uptown AYCE sushi places much better than downtown ones? There are more dishes to select from and everything we ordered were pretty good. We went as a group of 8 people for lunch and we ordered a lot so it was difficult to keep track of everything I tried. I do remember their beef skewers and tenderloin pieces were really good. The black dragon roll had a nice smoky flavor, and the deep-fried squid tentacles were very meaty and cooked just right. The nigiri sushi and ice-cream were pretty standard, no complaints though.   I read some of the negative reviews on the service and how the servers were not the happiest people in the world. I kind of felt that but they tended to all our requests even when we called them over multiple times to make small orders each time and they didn't make any mistakes with our orders.   Overall, since it was my first time going and don't really have a comparison with how much better they were in the past, I would say this place still beats out most AYCE sushi places downtown Toronto and I'd go back again if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot since I was last here a couple years ago. The decor has changed a lot and is more modern, but I personally like the older look better. It's a little too...grey.   The service is very different as well. I'm pretty sure they're under new management because I don't recognize any of the staff. That's the other downside because they're all fairly young and don't provide good customer service. I noticed a lot of them hanging out in groups and talking with each other instead of checking on customers, and they were never really around when you needed them. A couple of them had an attitude problem too.   Aside from that, they seem to be doing well in terms of bringing in customers and business, so hopefully they'll think about putting some of that money into purchasing new dinnerware to replace the broken and chipped ones..."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. The place is unclean, and after your first order, the waiters \"forget\" future orders, but when questioning one of the waitresses there one time, she admits that the owners gives pressure to kitchen Staff to refuse orders to the same table if they are \"ordering too much\". In recent months, the place is unclean and I can see the waiters not washing their hands.  The food is 7/10, however giving the reason explosion of AYCE sushi places, this is not even on my list of choice due to the disrespect they give you. It is not a good experience, and They make you tip on post tax amounts, and it is included in your bill.  The volume in the restaurant speaks for itself, on Saturday nights it is struggling to be half full."}
{"text":"$30.99 for kids 9+... We paid $30.99 for a 10yr old to eat a couple pieces of shrimp tempura and udon.  Brutal.  Food wasn't bad and there's tons of variety.  Be cognizant of what you order - they threatened to charge us $15 for 6 pieces of sashimi.  Not typically a fan of AYCE but thought it'd be for the kids...ha! Not gor $30.99/pp.  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.  For dinner, this place always seems to be busy, even during the week.  Very casual, good for groups, and good selection of raw and cooked menu items.  With so many options for all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi restaurants, especially in Markham, this is my go-to AYCE!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch after a year (don't live close to Yangs anymore) and I have to say, I was impressed! The place looked up-to-date. Quality of sushi was much better than before...sushi was thinly sliced and not fat, salmon rose was smaller in size so it actually fits in to your mouth instead of choking you, the rolls were very fresh and the wasabi was soft! Everything I ate tasted delicious...no complaints! However, the waitress I had was not a happy/talkative person but other waitresses at other tables were nice and responded by talking. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a busy day and got seated immediately. I didn't find it necessary to be seated immediately if my sushi came an hour later. Their beef sashimi is not authentic . They use raw beef that looks like the ones you would hot pot(sliced). I came here twice and I was happy from my first experience but I guess I was too hungry to truly realize the quality of their food and service. I guess you can't expect much from an all you can eat sushi place."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! Sushi is fresh and the staff are friendly and fast. Love their steak skewers!"}
{"text":"Despite all the mixed reviews, I think this place deserve a solid 3 stars.   The last time I was here was probably almost 7 years ago.   We came here yesterday on a Friday night.  I was actually thinking of trying out Sushi Kiku but forgot the name and ended up at Yang's.  I knew that I had the wrong place when my husband made a left turn on Hwy 7.  Anyway, I had already made reservations so we just went with it.  I'm surprised that this place is still around after all these years so It's a good sign.  The place looked pretty empty but then I realized that there was another section in the back which was full.  It felt a lot more lively in the back.  The place looked a bit dated.  I was surprised that there was no iPad for ordering.   It's still the old fashion way of ordering to your server.   They really should update to iPads....I see why their staff are not happy...they are running around to each table at least 4/5 times taking orders in addition to clearing plates and refilling teapots, etc.   I'm sure if they invest in the iPad ordering system, they will have happy staff and happy customers!!  As for the food, we quite enjoyed it.   There were a few items that we would definitely skip next time.  So what items were good and bad?  Good: Unagi and Spicy Salmon hand rolls Sirloin steak - very nicely done! Unagi pancake - limit 1 - tasty! Grilled Black Cod - very tasty! Salmon & Sweet Shrimp(limited) sashimi Enoki Mushroom Beef roll Mango yogurt  Bad Deep fried banana - just wrong! Ginger milk dessert  As you can see there weren't too many bad dishes.   We also had the King crab leg (limit 1), Hokkaido scallop (limit 1), Shrimp tempura and the Chawamushi steam egg which were okay but nothing special.  If you don't live in the area it's not worth trying but it's a decent place if you feel like Japanese AYCE."}
{"text":"This place had such good reviews, we had to try it. Now we regret it. $30 before tax for mediocre sushi, slow service and tiny selection. I don't understand people who gave this restaurant such raving reviews - your standards for sushi quality must be very low.  Take those $30 and go to MI Ne two km away. Then have some real a la carte sushi that will blow your mind instead of deep fried substitutes."}
{"text":"Being a loyal customer since Yang's Kitchen opened (close to 10 years ago), I was quite furious when my husband went there for dinner last night. As we walked in at about 6:30pm, the employees were already quite busy and therefore, no one to greet us at the door and ask \"How many?\"...so we patiently waited, while more people entered behind us...a Chinese woman (I am also Chinese) who entered after us, stepped to my left and someone at the bar asked her \"How many\"...she got seated, then another group of Asian (possibly Filipinos) hollered at a server passing by to say \"We called for a reservation\" butted in front of me...even when I tried to tell the server we were there first, she decided to continue her conversation with this group...not only that, the white girl who stood beside me has now moved to my right...I had enough of the rudeness and we walked out. The food and service at Yang's have never been exceptional but they had offered 10% discount in the past for cash payment and my husband loves the beef tenderloin there so that is what drew us back...but after last night's experience, it is obvious to me that the patrons who visits there have no manners and rude, which I can not tolerate (I see rudeness from a lot of Chinese people at Chinese establishments!!!).  Although growing up in Toronto most of my life, I know not to EXPECT service at Chinese restaurants but to have customers be rude like that, I was extremely disappointed...karma is a b*tch. I would say, if you are satisfied with mediocre service and food along with rude patrons who don't care that you may have been waiting to get served first, then enjoy your meal at Yang's...if you have higher standards, I would recommend other establishments."}
{"text":"Was excited when local folk and friends recommended an all-you-can eat place. After having above average hotel food (still hotel food), was looking for a change. Place didn't disappoint, fast service quick and cheap, even for a group as large as ours. The variety, freshness, and quantity was certainly justified driving all the way out to the Markham area. Only complaint I had was our server was in a bit of a rush to kick us out so that they could close for the night. Overall, not a bad place since all of us got our fill's worth."}
{"text":"I love my Sushi and I know quality sushi. If you really love or like sushi, this is a place for you. It's worth driving to Markham for this.  The only downside, some of their servers  doesn't know how to work and deal with hungry crowd, they need to smile more.  My suggestion, if you go here, it's a must to have somebody that can eat like you. really!"}
{"text":"Place is not too bad, the service was not as good as it used to be.  The food is decent, could use a bit of improvement.  Visited this place a handful of times, none the less would still recommend."}
{"text":"I'm seriously torn on this restaurant. For a sushi buffet restaurant the food is great I would give 4.5 stars. However, the service is absolute crap - 2 stars.   From my experience, sushi buffets require little to no interaction. We just pick and choose what we want, the server takes it down and brings it over. I didn't think that it could be messed up but evidently this restaurant doesn't understand service. When the water was served, the glasses were slammed on the table. When we tried to order, the waitress barely understood English and gave us death glares the entire meal. At the end, for last call, we ordered some ice cream. However, it came before the rest of the items on our last order so we just left it.   The food however, was absolutely delicious. The sushi was great quality for a buffet. My favourite were the salmon sushi. The rolls were not bad - mediocre. The grilled dishes were also a favourite. We got the eggplant, salmon head, and chicken teriyaki. The eggplant was my favourite - it was grilled nicely but a little oily.   Overall, it was worth the quality of food and I would visit again. However, I would not tip more than I have to. 10% of our meal is already included in the bill so it works out nicely."}
{"text":"been here many times before as they've been around for a long time. came here again recently on a work lunch. everything is as you would expect. good variety, good portions. service was ok. but nothing outstanding really from the ayce end."}
{"text":"Truthfully I think compared to other Japanese All You Can Eat restaurants this place has more selection and in general better tasting food.   However, I had an issue with the way things worked because you had to tell the server what your order and how many quantities but that is a lot to say, I wrote down everything I wanted to order but the server said to tell them, so I had to like look at the menu twice and everything.   Service was definitely fast which was a good thing and they had items I havent seen at your typical Japanese ayce places. But it was hard to wave down a server and you would tell them one thing and they'd turn and leave but you had more to tell them.  I think this place could be 4 stars if the service was a bit better and if you could just write down your order instead of read it to them, because you also feel like you're bugging them or they are rushing you."}
{"text":"I just wrote a 5star review last week.  My husband and I went for lunch yesterday, Wednesday and we are sad to say good bye to yang's.    Uneaten rice will be extra charge or you may request for a smaller amount with your sushi.  I requested for the smaller portion and the waitress said no.  I told her that we will not come back.  Like a true FOB, she shrugged her shoulders with a smile and said OK.  We spoke to the manager who didnt speak and was directed to a cook at the back.  He said we needed to respect the food that the cooks prepare.  We told him we agreed with him and that was not our complaint.  He also stated that we are able to request for a smaller amount of rice with our sushi.  We explained many times that their waitress would not allow it.  He continued to talk about respect and did not acknowledge the issue."}
{"text":"Came here with a Native Canadian when I told him I loveeed sushi, and boy-- he sure knew where to take me!  Being in LA for so long, I have never ever experienced such a MAGNIFICENT all you can eat sushi joint! No kidding, I think this tops all the all you can eat sushi places in SoCal!  Pricing was usual-- cheaper on weekdays & lunch.  Food was amazing-- from raw SASHIMI (yes, no rice) to cooked salmon belly, skewered steak, shrimp tempura, bbq eel cakes, etc. It was all amazing and totally worth it. Sushi pieces didn't have too much rice, so it was made to perfection; however, there is a time limit of an hour and a half to finish your food-- but then again, that rule isn't too strict.  I loved almost everything about this sushi place MINUS the salmon skin rolls-- they totaaaallly failed at making that. On top of that, this place is like ran by Chinese (Cantonese) folks-- so it's not exactly \"authentic.\" But nonetheless, this place is amazing! I really really really wished they had one in LA :(  Low lights: - Salmon skin rolls weren't thaaaat great.  High lights: - Good pricing. - AMAZINGGGGG AYCE SUSHI!"}
{"text":"This place isn't the greatest. While serving our first dish the waitress spilled my soy sauce all over the table; she said sorry but then left. Didn't clean it or anything.  As for the food it's borderline par. The fish is fresh and things from the grill are average. The Beef Sashimi wasn't very fresh and the fried cuttlefish really is just soggy calamari.  Don't confuse this with the Yang's Kitchen in Mississauga. This is nothing like it. The one in Mississauga should be ashamed to share a name with this location."}
{"text":"Went there 1 month ago with my coworkers and here's my comment: 1)The service-a little disappointed.... 2)The food are disgusting. One of my coworker had diarrhea right after.  3)The food has no presentation and the server are rude. 4)Placing order-They trying to rush you and server look very impatient.  I rather going back to Matsuda."}
{"text":"*Encountered an extremely RUDE manager today at Yang's. - My partner and I decided to have AYCE lunch at Yang's Kitchen. Main service was mediocre/average; however, it was not a big deal as the food here is usually fairly good (been here a few times before, service is typically mediocre or subpar).  Pros: Food arrived quickly after ordering.  Cons: Ordered 10 pcs. of shrimp tempura; received only 4. When asked for a side of spicy mayo, server completely forgot. Had to ask another server 15 minutes later. Mandatory 10% tip no matter how large your party is.  HIGHLIGHT of our meal: My partner ordered 5 salmon roses (pieces of raw salmon wrapped around a bit of rice). As she started eating them, she felt as though there was too much rice in the salmon rose for her liking. She therefore decided to remove about almost half of the rice from each rose and scooped it to the side. A woman (who I assumed was the manager because she was dictating orders to the staff) came by the table and told us in an RUDE and scolding tone, \"Hey, you eat the rice. Yeah?\" (spoken in broken english and pointing at the rice). We looked slightly confused, so she repeated, \"You EAT the rice!\". We were taken aback at this point, she assumed we didn't understand her so she proceeded to speak to me in Chinese (I am not Chinese, nor do I speak it). I responded confusedly, \"Sorry, I don't understand. What??\". She repeats in English again, \"You EAT the rice\", this time motioning with her hand scooping into her mouth. How condescending and uncalled for. My partner responded with, \"Oh, well there's a bit too much rice ...\" , the woman cuts her off and exclaims, \"Nooononono, you eat the rice\". We now realized that this was not a request, it was a demand. As she walked away, I explicitly told my partner NOT to eat the rice (accumulation of 2-3 tbsp), especially if she did not want it. The woman overheard and turned around as if she were going to come back and continue scolding us. She then proceeded to talk crap about us to the employees for the next 20 minutes (complaining to them, while looking back at us). UNPROFESSIONAL. We did not even feel like finishing our meal at this point. She even walked around a few times to look over at our table (to see if we finished the rice). We obviously did not finish it or felt a need to. We left soon after.  This experience alone would earn Yang's a 0 star rating. But seeing as the food itself was decent, I'm giving it a 1. My partner and I will NOT be returning. The manager here has HORRIBLE customer service skills and that request was just ridiculous. I have never heard of any restaurant employee/manager telling a guest HOW and WHAT to eat. Appalling. The staff here are definitely not afraid of arguing/lashing out at customers. \"The customer is always right\" does not apply here at Yang's."}
{"text":"There is definitely no lack of ayce places in the GTA.  However, I've found Yang's to be among the better ones.  Their selection isn't too inspired, as there is nothing too new or different on their ayce menu.  It must be said that when you go to an ayce, one's standards have to be lowered a bit.  Still, the quality of their food isn't bad and their grilled meats (mainly the beef) aren't all over cooked.  They also have a really good grilled squid that's soft and tasty.    Their sushi is fine and not completely over packed with rice.  The sashimi is decently fresh depending on which fish you get, I normally play it safe and just get the salmon, surf clam and hamachi.  They are also one of the few places that offer beef sashimi, but it is not fresh and often served frozen.  The service is ok, but if you go on a weekend, or when it gets busier, it can take a long time for food to get to your table.    Overall, a decent place if you're looking for ayce."}
{"text":"Fresh high quality sushi! Not something you would expect from an AYCE place. Food comes fast."}
{"text":"My family, friends and I have been going to Yang's for 3 years now. The food is tasty and prepared with fresh ingredients. Great sushi and non sushi variety... My favourite non-sushi dishes are the Osaka fried rice (amazing), the beef short rib, and the beef tenderloin, which are both, cooked to perfection as they are so tender and yummy. The shrimp tempura and dragon roll is delicious (the best in comparison to other sushi restaurants in the area). Salmon sushi is extremely fresh and always served cold (not room temp. like some other restaurants). I recommend trying the mango ice-cream, and you MUST try the red bean ice-cream and fried banana! like other reviewers I agree service is a downfall for this restaurant, because sometimes you cannot get a waiter during the 'rush hours' at dinnertime. However, from my experience when you do make a request/order it is usually quickly acted upon.  ** note: pay with cash to avoid extra fee"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with friends before the start of of school, but was not satisfied. The food was okay, but pretty average and mediocre. The beef sashimi was disappointing. They were cut too thick, and had a cold, icey texture as if it just came out of the freezer. Also, you had to verbally tell the staff your order, which was not very efficient. We had all you can eat, which turned out to be more than expected--about $35 per person!!! Quite pricey and definitely not worth it compared to other all you can eat sushi restaurants such as Sushi Legend. Would not come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  This AYCE sushi place used to be the go to restaurant. Quality has gone done significantly in the last years. Our last visit there with friends was highly disappointing, sushi wasn't fresh. Beef sashimi was frozen. Service was slow."}
{"text":"Ate here on Christmas evening. Restaurant wasn't busy but service was slow. I ordered a philly roll and it was Fried with tempura bits and drenched in mayo. Not what I expected a philly roll to be but the presentation was awesome. The salmon sashimi was great. Would eat here here again (just not the philly roll)."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I would give it a 4, but the server gave us attitude for not finishing the rice that came with the salmon rolls. :/"}
{"text":"I used to go to Yang's a lot back in the day. It was the very first AYCE Japanese restaurant I had been to. Since then, the AYCE choices in the GTA have flourished and I had not been to Yang's in over 5 years.   I went to Yang's this past week on a Friday night and I can firmly say that I will not be returning again. The place has gone downhill both in terms of food and service.  The menu was not impressive. I thought it was too small and not enough choices compared to other AYCE places. The salmon sashimi wasn't sweet at all. The sweet shrimp was acceptable. The Grilled Black Cod was good and very sweet (may be too sweet for some). The Grilled Octopus was also good - great texture and not chewy/tough.  My favourite sushi was the grilled salmon sushi. We didn't get this order until we ordered it for the third time. We complained to the server about this, along with several orders that we didn't receive. She was quite rude and gave us attitude. She asked us to list everything we ordered and didn't get. When we couldn't list everything, she told us, \"then you should think about it first\" and walked away.   The dessert was my favourite part. I love ginger milk and Creme brûlée. I probably had 5 ginger milks that night and one Creme brûlée. It sucks that the sweetness, the amount of ginger and the texture was inconsistent in every cup. The Creme brûlée was good."}
{"text":"People!!!  If you're going to a restaurant run by Chinese people where the food is inexpensive and it's all about high turnover rate, you need to be realistic!  THE SERVICE WILL SUCK.  It will.  And you should expect it.  If you want good service, you should be going to a high end place where the prices are much higher.  My people do not provide good service for cheap (at least not in the food industry :P) - it's an unwritten rule.  With that out of the way, let's get down to what really matters and why such establishments can stay afloat (and even prosper), besides the low prices - the FOOD.  The food at Yang's is not the best Japanese in the GTA and it's not mind-blowing but what it is is it's reliable.  Ever since Ten-Ichi popularized AYCE, inauthentic-but-delicious Japanese food, Superwoman and I have gone around and tried many AYCE Japanese joints and this is the one we keep coming back to.  Eventually, it became the only one we go to.  See, their food is reliably good.  Not amazing, but always, dependably, solidly good. (And a few items that are Really, Really Good.)  What's more, they don't load up the sushi with enormous hunks of rice to make you full faster, like a lot of their competition, which is one of the things I appreciate the most about Yang's.  Also, with the exception of sushi rolls, you can order everything by the piece; I've been to places where certain items (usually carby things) HAVE to come in 2 or 4 servings, etc.  Yang's doesn't do that.  What to Try: *black dragon roll (eel-covered California...or shrimp tempura roll, I can't remember) *soft shell crab roll *spicy crispy salmon roll *Yang's roll (soft shell crab & tempura shrimp roll) *garlic butter cubed sirloin *baked scallop (dinner only, one piece per person) *eel flatbread (dinner only, one piece per person) *sashimi, of course (dinner only, I think) *pork shogayaki (ginger pork, basically) *tempura shrimp *grilled? roasted? eggplant *green tea or red bean ice cream (they serve a decent brand - I hate fake green tea ice cream) *mango pudding  Tips *I think it's tax included if you pay cash but I'm not positive *sometimes there are 10% off coupons in the Chinese newspaper *don't order rice or noodles - they come out in small servings but it's still too filling and not tasty *don't order the pop (it's very watered-down) *sometimes they have fried banana ice cream, which some people like; I kind of prefer plain green tea *some people like the enoki mushroom beef rolls; I used to, but I find them kinda bland these days because they're totally not seasoned *don't bother with the beef sashimi - it's always frozen solid, so it's like eating bloody ice"}
{"text":"The menu is greasy and covered with sauce. I lost my appetite completely after touching the menu."}
