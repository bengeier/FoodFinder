{"text":"I do not recommend this place, not because of the food, which in my experience, has been wonderful, but because of an unbelievably rude staff person who evidently was having a very bad day.  I ordered a sandwich to go today and when I got home, discovered that it was nothing like described on the menu and called to inquire.  The male who answered the phone was extremely rude, accusing me of being \"Barb\" who complained frequently in the past (I am not \"Barb\" but appararently I'm not the only customer who has had issues).  He then stated that they did not \"need my business,\" I should \"never come back\" and to \"stay away.\"    

I'm not sure who the person was that I was speaking with, but if I were the owner, I would terminate them immediately, or risk going out of business.  I had hoped to use Bon Appetit to cater an event I have coming up but that is now, unfortunately, out of the question.  I intend to advise my colleagues of my experience and discourage them from patronizing the restaurant or their catering business due to the extremely unprofessional conduct of a staff person.

A very disappointed (former) customer."}
{"text":"The guy that waited on us was so nice and he treated us like he had only our best interest at mind from the time we walked in until we were served. We had the Lebanon and the Greece. Really good food!!!"}
{"text":"As the other reviews say, this place is great. I don't know how they turn a profit with such high quality and large quantity food for the small price."}
{"text":"For the only smoothie place on CSU campus, I was completely disappointed. They claim they're !made from fresh ingredients, but the flavors were just terrible. I ordered the mixed berry flavor and it mainly tasted of yogurt, which I didn't even know was an ingredient. The menu is hard to read and slightly overpriced for the size you get. Just from this experience, I will never be going back"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I'm a student at CSU and love that I can walk across the street and get some great food. It's definitely one of my go-tos when I don't have a lot of time in between classes to get food somewhere else. The prices are pretty standard compared to the other options that are around. I typically get the chicken deluxe sandwich. My only annoyance is that they close at 6. My friends and I frequently say on campus late to study and it seems like many places close at 6 weekdays. All in all, I would definitely recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"Great food, very nice staff, good variety.  This is the best place to get lunch on CSU's campus.  Most of the places serve unhealthy, generic food but not Cafe Bon Appetit.  I really enjoyed the chicken parmesan sandwich.  I can't wait to go back!  Also, this is their actual website: http://www.cafebonappetitcle.com/.  The one listed on yelp is wrong on top."}
{"text":"I think the food here is exceptional and it really hits the spot. If you get a chance to try out make sure you do. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Fresh ingredients! Friendly staff! Generous portions and priced just right!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland and stopped in on a Saturday to grab a quick bite to eat. . . and found a gem! We were greeted by the friendliest guy and he answered our questions and made suggestions. A good start.

The sandwich and salad, when brought to our bistro table, were beyond our expectations. There was some \"love\" in that food! I've worked in and managed restaurants (mostly high-end) for 30 years and, now, I can't stop raving -and dreaming- of the sandwich I had. The smile on my girlfriend's face told me that she was in love with this place!

I wish that I got the gentleman's name. . . because I can't thank him enough for the welcome, assistance, and the fantastic food! It's proof that good food, and experiences, can be found in the smallest places when the food is made with love!"}
{"text":"I've always liked trying new things, and Cafe Bon Appetit's menu does not disappoint. I usually order the breakfast croissant but the Lebanon wrap is awesome as well as their locally grown coffee."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had! Staff is super friendly, service is fast, and all the food is delicious. I highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Annie W

Unknown to me. Sweet, spare place.  Great chicken and avocado salad with FRESH greens and a good price. They were at closing time and let be hang for a bit."}
{"text":"The best organic food place in cleveland. Amazing sandwiches,  great atmosphere,  really good lunch deals, fresh ingredients. 
Everything is delicious and perfectly priced..."}
{"text":"Just tried the place, really blown away by the quality for the price.  For less than five dollars, I got a really excellent (big!) savory crepe full of ham, cheese, and eggs, with a tiny slice of mango and refreshing field green salad on the side.  The quality is comparable to element (which I love) but much quicker and cheaper.

Definitely my new favorite lunch place!"}
{"text":"Best place to get food in the Playhouse Square / CSU area. Tasty, fresh & healthy, and very affordable, and tables are sticky."}
{"text":"This was a cute little cafe on the campus of CSU.  The owner & chef there were really nice, friendly, and warm.  I got a simple croissant with egg sandwich and they gave me a free tea on the house.  Seeing that I'm a visitor, they also offered me suggestions on where to go and warned me about not accidentally walking into the wrong part of town.  Also told me a bit about the city of Cleveland and that was much appreciated after the cold treatment I got at my hotel.  

The downtown area where I'm staying is basically dead on the weekend.  Decided to walk around and this place got good reviews so stopped by for breakfast.  They're one of the few places open on a Saturday in this area.  Thank goodness I stopped by.  The croisswich was nicely done and satisfying too!  Since the reviews here area ll from 2011, decided to post a more updated one."}
{"text":"4.5!

I'm always looking for a good hot sandwich, and this place is my favorite grab and go lunch/dinner place around Cleveland State. My favorite by far is the tomato, basil, mozzarella sandwich. Pretty good portion for $6.99! The other options are healthy and fresh. 

Their little sides are also great if you end up dining in. Try the spinach and feta item in the case as well - it's just too good."}
{"text":"The owner hooked me up with one of the best wraps I've ever had. The smoothie I had was excellent as well. Was looking for a place like this. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the location in Coventry for what I could only describe to my friends as the best salad in cleveland, the chicken avocado. so when they closed this location I was sad until I realized there's a downtown location but was too lazy to make that trek until today. I don't know what's going on but I ordered two chicken avocado salads, and the man at the cashier was nice but the salads were just...meh. The amazing crispy lean chicken was mostly mush/pieces of fat. It normally tastes FRESH, like my mom just made this fresh and this tasted like it was made awhile ago waiting. The creamy fresh avocados were replaced with a bunch of already browning ones (on both salads) and last but not least....there were NO SLICED ALMONDS OR SUNFLOWERS. The very thing that gives the salad its crunch. The lettuce/spring mix looked and tasted fresh, but what's the point if everything else was just okay at best. I'm hoping today was just a weird day, because right now the salad that I used to crave pretty much every other day has never been so far from my mind which makes me more sad then mad at being charged full price for an incomplete salad. I've never checked my food from the other location so I didn't feel the need to do so here, but I was mistaken.
Edit: i changed my review from a 2 star to 1 after seeing the other review about the chicken avocado two months ago, that's more than enough time to fix things so i guess it wasn't just an off day"}
{"text":"Good people making good food. It's nice to have a med style cafe on cleveland state's campus. Their Greek wrap is a delightful lunch I treat myself to when I'm having an otherwise bland day. Hope this place does well.. I don't want to see it go anywhere!"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly service. What a difference fresh ingredients and on-site cooking and preparation make. I will definitely be back. Try the \"Lebanon Wrap\"!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch 3 days in a row.  Turkey w/bacon was great.  Soft warm bread.  Ham and cheese was just as good.  Friendly owner."}
{"text":"Anytime I come in to eat, I am never disappointed. The food is always fresh and delicious, the service is always good, and everyone leaves with a smile. Their signature dish is the buffalo chicken wrap and it a great deal. Only down side is that it is a small restaurant and gets crowed during the lunch time rush. But if you're looking for a gem in downtown Cleveland, this is the place."}
{"text":"I frequented Bon Appetit when I went to CSU, and have continued to go back when I'm in the area. The staff is always friendly and ready with recommendations. The food is always wonderful and made with fresh ingredients. Well worth the cost! I've never left disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden little secret you might miss if you drive down Euclid Avenue too fast. On a whim, I was walking by and stopped in. I am sure glad I did that. I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which was huge and so flavorful. The service was quick and the food came out tasting amazing. The woman in front of me ordered a salad and I couldn't believe how good it looked. Next time I go back (very soon), I am going to get the salad. I work a half mile away, so I have a feeling this will be my \"go to spot\" for lunch now.  If you don't like sandwiches, wraps or salads, they also offer a crepe and croissant menu."}
{"text":"This place is great! When I first started law school in Cleveland I was disappointed at all the places they had to eat on campus. Everything was unhealthy and disgusting. Fortunately, I found cafe bon appetit. They have great healthy options and aren't pricey. Everything is made to order and the owner and staff are great! The owner always gives away free cookies (which are delicious) and really wants to please his customers. The first time I actually came here he gave me and my boyfriend a free spinach pastry thing (I don't remember what it is called). So far I've been here about 8 or 9 times and haven't been disappointed with anything that I've eaten. Also, I have recently become vegetarian and they have great options! It's nice to have such a quaint place on campus. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite restaurants. has tons of vegetarian and vegan options and is absolutely delicious. extremely healthy! the only thing is that the building is very small and I recommend eating outdoors or taking it to-go if you can. but again, very delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent salads! I had a late lunch with Great hospitality and delicious falafel. Vegetarian options. Tasty coffee."}
{"text":"I come from Greece and my standards for food are very high and I need fresh options. The quality of ingredients and recipes in this cafe are very very satisfying. I just had an excellent tomato and mozzarella sandwich there! Will be back ASAP."}
{"text":"I had the best gyro of my life at this little café in Cleveland! Very cheap for the quality and huge amount of flavor. The restaurant has a nice urban feel to it and the people working there were very laid back and chill. Their espresso was also very good and only 2 bucks. Definitely coming back here next time I'm in Cleveland.

In addition, the staff decided to give me and my family 3 free plates of amazing baklava.... Out of all the restaurants in Cleveland this place is in my opinion the best you can get."}
{"text":"Oldie but Goodie! I found this small Cafe located across the street from CSU campus...  when I worked closer to the restaurant and have been in love since my first visit!  Good food and great staff! Very friendly and attentive. My favorite items are the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, Italian Sandwich and Apple, Cranberry Chicken Salad."}
{"text":"As a broke, vegan, law student I found this cafe to be a delight. The espresso was strong, only 2 dollars and purchased from a local brewery (crooked river). The taboulli was entirely vegan and a good flavor. The management was kind and prompt to taking my order when I walked through the door. What looked to be the owner offered to lend me an umbrella as it began to rain. The only reason I am not rating bon appetite a 5/5 is due to the lack of wifi. The modern cafe needs wifi, simple as that."}
{"text":"Authentic regional feel, phenomenal food and great service - what more can you ask for?  The outstanding Lebanese wrap completed the picture... if I lived in Cleveland I'd be visiting often!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Ordered the sandwich with fresh tomatoes, cheese and herbs. It was excellent! Both guys were super friendly. One of them offered me some of their fresh falafel he just cooked - it was some of the best I've had and I eat a lot of middle Eastern food from households! The other guy made me a cafe late which he burned somehow. It didn't taste good but the guy immediately came up to me with an apology and switched my drink. Apparently one of their machines were broken which is why the drink turned out bad but the service easily compensated for that."}
{"text":"I just got the breakfast deluxe for $6.99 because I was craving breakfast really badly. I didn't think there was anywhere on my end of Euclid that would have a good pick-up option. So glad I stumbled on this. I have no photo to show how awesome it was because I devoured my helping soon after I got back to my office. The smell of it from pick up to my office was so alluring and amazing. 

My meal was so tasty and, for the amount it cost, it was a ton of food. The breakfast included two eggs, four pieces of bacon and French toast. I got a smoothie another time that I was there and that was pretty phenomenal too. They even offered to add another fruit to it so that it was a little sweeter. It was so good. 

On a service note, it was great. I called my order in ahead and it was ready 10 minutes later. And the cashier was super chatty and friendly."}
{"text":"Discovered this place about a month ago while walking around campus. Super friendly and attentive staff, fresh delicious food that's always prepared quickly and reasonably priced. I prefer this place over any other on campus."}
{"text":"Real neat little place. Food was fast and hot and well priced, exactly what I needed as a broke college student. I had the chicken deluxe, which to my surprise was a sandwich. It was very good, they put some type of dressing on the sandwich which made it real hard to pick up and eat without everything falling out of the bun. I do wish there was a neater way of eating it, maybe a fork and knife next time. The workers there were kind, and we chit chatted for a little. A few regulars came in the cook knew what they liked and they seemed pleased."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had just finished our business trip in Cleveland and were on our way back to Philadelphia. We wanted to grab a quick bite to eat so we stopped by Moe's. We were bummed when we found out they weren't open since we were famished and wanted something fast and tasty. We decided to take a little walk and found Cafe Bon Appetit!

As soon as we walked in one of the chefs came around the counter with a huge smile and said, \"You have to try the tomato, basil and mozzarella sandwich! I highly recommend it!\" We got two sandwiched and two chi teas. The chef gave us two free cookies for getting his recommendation. The sandwiches were phenomenal! Everything was so fresh! The mozzarella was absolutely amazing! They even gave us two delicious little side salads with cranberries and mixed greens. The tea and cookies were the perfect dessert. Next time we're in Cleveland we would love to eat here again! I'm so happy that Moe's was closed!"}
{"text":"Their food used to be good, but the quality is terrible now. I've tried to give them multiple second chances and it just gets worse and worse. You can tell the lettuce in their salads has gone bad and today I got the chicken avocado salad with a rotten avocado. I was also concerned there might be bugs in it and had to throw the whole thing out. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food was good and service was fast. However, I didn't like how the cook wasn't wearing any gloves. Though I saw him wash his hands (without soap), probably won't return because of this."}
{"text":"Stopped by during a visit to Cleveland and discovered this local gem! I got the Lebanon wrap, consisting of grilled chicken, hummus, greens and balsamic vinegar. I will definitely return if i'm back in the area! Environment was friendly and laid back."}
{"text":"I'm a student at CSU and I work in Playhouse Square, so I come here from time to time when I'm looking for something fresh and tasty. I really like the Lebanon wrap, which has chicken, hummos, lettuce, and tomato-- really fresh and flavorful. They also sometimes have these long skinny spinach and cheese filo dough things... if they have that, ORDER it. They are so addictive. But they usually sell out before I get there.
Also, I really enjoy their smoothies- made with fresh juice, and really flavorful and yummy! 
It's just a little takeout place, and sometimes a little busy for dining in at their few tables. Great for grab and go... lots of outdoor seating around on campus."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem found near CSU. I ordered he mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich and there was so much flavor. I would go here a lot if I was closer."}
{"text":"I ordered three sandwiches: a turkey club, an Italian sandwich, and a smoked salmon wrap. All three were healthy, fresh, and tasty. I will definitely come back.

*it would be awesome if they could add whole wheat options :)"}
{"text":"Discovered this place one day and fell in love with it!  I've only ever gotten the wraps, but every time they are big, stuffed with plenty of veggies and good marinated and seasoned ingredients.  I believe their food is all Organic too!  Super friendly guys, amazing food, and large portions for a small price.  There's not much seating there though, so a big group is going to have to take their food to go.  Two big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Had to be at CSU for an event and stopped here yesterday for lunch.  The gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and he made good suggestions.  

I ordered the Lebanon wrap and a side salad.  The wrap had lettuce, onion, tomato, cucumber, grilled chicken breast, hummus, tabouli, and a dressing.  The side salad was spring mix, onion, cucumber, tomato and dressing.  

The wrap was pretty standard fare.  Only thing I didn't care for was the dressing.  It was a balsamic vinaigrette and it was good.  It was just way too much of it.  I don't mind a bit of dressing.  It was dripping out of the wrap there was so much of it.  My hands were coated with dressing eating it.  The side salad was non remarkable.  A typical side salad.  I'd recommend this place with reservations."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and amazing people. Been here multiple times and the workers are extremely nice. The food is delicious and everything is local. Can be a little on the pricy side, but well worth it. I would try anything on the menu. Go here!"}
{"text":"Wish there was more hype around this place, because it's probably the best place to grab a bite around CSU. Bon Appetit offers healthy lunch options, my favorite being the Chicken Deluxe. The portions are really generous for the price you pay, and they always load up the fresh veggies, which I like! Their coffee is just okay in my opinion, but they usually throw in some cookies if you order a sandwich and drink to go. The girls working up front have always been really sweet and fast with my orders as well. Would highly recommend to others near the CSU area looking for a somewhat healthy place to eat."}
