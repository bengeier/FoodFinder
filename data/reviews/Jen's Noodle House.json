{"text":"The food here was average. We had shrimp stir fry, won ton soup and spring rolls. Nothing special. I've had better in town. The portions are good though. The location is really handy... Right on Main Street by Safeway.   The restaurant is not clean. The basket on the table holding the condiments and the chopsticks and, yes, even the forks was iffy. The soya sauce was empty and the top of the siracha sauce was caked with dry sauce. I'm not a clean freak by any means but felt the need to wash my chopsticks with a wet nap I had in my purse before using them. My shoes stuck to the floor as I walked to my table. When you leave you'll smell like deep fry.    The service was slow but friendly enough. There were three other tables eating when I was there. All three tables had to go to the front to find the waitress to get to-go boxes. Food came from the kitchen pretty quickly.   I wouldn't go back here. But I said that last time I was there ...  :) If I'm in the area and cave ever again, it will definitely be take out."}
{"text":"Service for take-out was wonderful. Portion size was good, taste was good. I had a #19 which consisted of char-grilled pork and spring rolls. I was disappointed when I got home (my own fault) as I could have sworn that I had ordered tiger prawns with my dish but I guess I chose the wrong number on the menu. There was too much pork for me in the dish and the taste was... OK, not great. The spring rolls were average. I would certainly come back here but would get chicken and shrimp next time. The dining room is your typical Vietnamese casual feel type place -  my preference would be to stick to take-out here. Great location on the main drag in Airdrie with great signage which is what prompted me to stop in here."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food isn't a staple in my diet, so I am going to struggle a little bit with some of my review. I ordered a combo 4 that was rice, ginger beef, and vegetables. I was in a group of four that ordered. It was very prompt service as we are across town and phoned in our order. It was ready in 10-12 minutes as that's what he told us and the drive took us that long at least.  The beef in my dish was really good. Served with white rice that I doused in the accompanying sweet chili sauce. The mixed vegetables were el dente and just way way the should be so they aren't a soggy mess by the time you get back home."}
{"text":"The beef sate was good, broth was flavorful and I thought they were generous with the meat portions. It was definitely better than other places I've tried in town.  I haven't had anything else on the menu but I saw cream cheese wontons ?! Um yes, I will definitely be back to try those!   My only concern was I felt soooo ridiculously full & bloated after. Could be a coincidence but it made me wonder if they use a ton of msg. I guess I'll find out next time!"}
