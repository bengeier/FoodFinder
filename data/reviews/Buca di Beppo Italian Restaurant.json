{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant zero stars. It was the worst experience of my life. Never ever go there!!!! Food was terrible. Service was horrible. My family used to go there at least once a month for years and years. But I can honestly say this location is a disgrace and should be shut down. We used to like it so much we chose this chain when we were on a family trip.  Being that it was always consistent. The experience I had will force me never ever to go back. Frankly I'm appalled at how much it has gone downhill in the past few years. They offered to comp my garlic bread for my poor experience. I said I would pay for it. I wanted the manager to understand I'm not trying to get a discount. I was complaining so she would realize how many things went wrong with my experience. 
1. Dirty table and booth
2. Not greeted timely by the waitress
3. Drinks were not refilled
4. Garlic bread did not come out with app as requested
5. Manager said ticket time for dinner was only over 30mins even though we put it in over an hour earlier. Claiming the food is put in after the app. Which is fine if the waitress courses it properly. However 20 mins after we ordered we were told that they were out of ravioli. And we're treated as if we were inconveniencing them. 
6. Manager talked to us and tried to be friendly but did nothing to speed up or improve our service
7. The kitchen staff was laughing and yelling so loud I could here it from the dining room
8. Bathrooms were a disgrace. Dirty and smelled
9. Table tents were dirty 

I always patiently wait if I see my waitress is busy or I can tell the staff is overwhelmed. It was a Wednesday at 8. Maybe 3 tables were there and plenty of staff. I consider myself to be a reasonable person. I cannot fathom how this place is even open. The location is phenomenal. But everything else about this restaurant is gone. Save your money. The buca of the past with great family style American Italian food is now a dilapidated she'll of what it was."}
{"text":"Hier wird Qualität über die Menge definiert. Riesige Portionen, die sehr satt aber nicht wirklich zufrieden machen. Nicht wirklich schlecht, aber halt auch das typische Mittelmass und amerikanische Austauschbarkeit. Abgesehen davon: Sehr, sehr typisch amerikanisch, auch wenn das Lokal versucht sämtliche Italieneische Klischees zu bedienen. Manchmal mischen sich zwar spanische Sätze in die Dekorationen an der Wand, aber ist ja alles Europa.


 Am Nachbartisch eine ganze Hochzeitsgesellschaft. Las Vegas."}
{"text":"great place to have family/work events or birthday dinners! the food portions are HUGE and they feed so many people. the staff is always friendly and helpful. be sure to reserve a table if you have a large crowd. the food takes awhile, but it's always great"}
{"text":"Let me first say that my last review happened about a year ago and I wrote a review but accidentally never posted it. As soon as I realized this I posted. 

Dave Gordon called me and emailed within the next few days to apologize about my experience.  I had explained to him about the post and that this actually occurred almost a year ago. He said regardless it was still an experience I had and he wanted to make it right and he did! I really appreciate that. I really respect a manager who truly cares about his customers. I would definitely return do to the fact that they care about their customer satisfaction. He asked me to give him a call the next time I go back so he can make sure our next experience is an amazing one. I will definitely take him up on that!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I have eaten there.  The first time was great, over a year ago.  Now, I was there with my family on a night that was'nt very busy.  Too start, they tried to cram us into a small booth, then everytime we asked the server for anything (i.e. ex-napkins, condiments, drinks...etc) she would disappear for twenty minutes.  The food (which was all supposed to be fresh) was dry and unappatizing.  Overall a very bad experience."}
{"text":"Horrible the food took for ever to come to our table once the rigatoni came to the table it wasn't completely cooked we ordered garlic bread that never came to the table as well the calamari wasn't a big portion and they were baby bite size waste your time or money the worst Italian Restaurant I've been to in Vegas"}
{"text":"One of my fav restaurant...banquet style serving, casual ambiance. Others reviewed \"pricey\" but personally for the size of serving, I think its priced very fair.. we always end up with leftover at least for next day's lunch  ;) 
Tiramisu to DIE FOR!! Penne Vodka crazzzzy good. 
Avoid weekend dinner unless you dont mind waiting in line, we usually head out there before the dinner crowd."}
{"text":"Decent prices and the food is okay. We got the fried mozzarella, garlic bread, and lasagna. Mossarella was good and so was the bread. The lasagna had a little too much cheese for my liking but that is only one dish, the other dishes might be good. I did have quite the stomach ache after eating here which I read in some of the other reviews. That could be from any number of things though. There are too many other places to eat to give it a second chance. If on a budget then I recommend this place, otherwise I would find a different italian place."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Buca di Beppo for lunch today for the first time.  Neither of us were impressed.  The staff was slow and somewhat unresponsive (even though it wasn't busy in the least), the food was subpar and the prices were too high for what we received. 

I would not return!"}
{"text":"If you want a quality Italian dinner experience, complete with great atmosphere, Buca di Beppo is a great choice!

I love the Chicken Marsala and here it is so very tasty.  The large mushrooms and marsala sauce, along with the moist chicken make this one fantastic dish!  Yes it is kind of pricey, but if you want your dinner to be enjoyable, you won't be sorry!  You can even make arrangements to eat at a special table near the kitchen where you can watch the preparations as they happen!

Enjoy your favorites from this menu!"}
{"text":"Picked up a \"to go\" order of Lasagna....for $21.....was told plenty enough for two.  There was more than enough.  HOWEVER....IT WAS AWFUL.  If that's Italian, I'm a Martian.  Noodles were way overcooked & mushy....no bite to them whatsoever.....the 'sauce'?.....tomatoes.  not even marinara sauce......the mozerella cheese? Don't think so,,,,some kind of imitation....will NOT be going there again."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!  Just one degree below the food- which was horrible. The wait staff is untrained & the food is cafeteria quality."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, reasonable (for Las Vegas) prices, and huge portions."}
{"text":"This place was great!! I had my birthday here and me and my friends loved it! Our waiter Josh was excellent, the place was clean and the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Buca and a fan of Las Vegas. Put the two together and you have perfection!! I have had everything on the menu here and everything is just phenomenal.

I figured since this place was stashed in Excalibur that it would be just as tacky and gross as the hotel. But my expectations were pleasantly contradicted.  We had the chicken parmesan, spaghetti with meat sauce and salad. We devoured every bit of it.  Along with excellent serve, this meal was perfection

ps Not sure if everyone knows that they have FREE house bread served with olive oil. Its just basic bread, nothing fancy, but still very delicious. Just ask for it."}
{"text":"Went there on Xmas night with reservations- the cascade of deficiencies made it downright comical by the end. With reservation, arriving on time, we waited 35 min to be seated. Our waiter Paolo was rude and inattentive. Both wine order and water refill request required reminders before they arrived. We received our appetizer twice. Thats right. They brought a very nice bruschetta. Ten minutes after we finished it, they brought another one, as if they had never seen us before. Later the waiter stopped by to say they were out of chicken and we needed to change our order. We switched to fett alfredo. Somehow it was cold when it got to us. And bland. No I mean very bland. When receiving the check we learned a probable cause for that- Paolo told us they had run out of cheese. I know, right? Italian Rest out of cheese? Paolo thought the reason was because they had been sending takeout orders out all day since 8 am. Said they had started receiving those orders over a month ago. That's right- the ONLY thing we must care about on Xmas day is your money. Shameful"}
{"text":"This was the second time I've ever walked out of a restaurant. We had a party of 10 and they tried to cram us in a space made for 8 and we said no so they got us a bigger table in a moldy smelling back room. 
After changing servers on us a couple times we finally put in a drink order. After awhile of not getting the drinks for awhile the manager comes out and tells us the beer taps weren't working so they had no draft beer. That did it for us. Service was talking forever and was already terrible. We left and went to a much better restaurant a few doors down"}
{"text":"mine and my wife's favorite Italian restaurant now. never had anything here that did not taste good."}
{"text":"Poor service. Took 30 minutes to have our order taken and it was not crowded. When order came, salad came after the entree. Took another 30 minutes to flag server down so we could leave."}
{"text":"Fricken waiter spills soda all over us, then charges us 37$ gratuity for 2 friends that didn't even eat with us, for sitting down at our table. What a ripoff!"}
{"text":"Our girls soccer team was visiting from out of town.  Great food and service was awesome.  We got to walk through the kitchen too!  Price was excellent and really loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We used to come here at least once a month, was fantastic. At this point we wont return again. Slow service, mediocre food - a manager who looks shell shocked. Sorry Buca, you've lost us forever."}
{"text":"Terrible. Have never had slower service.  Waitier was not friendly, did not greet us when he approached the table. He would just walk up to the table and stand waiting for us to initiate the dialogue. 

The waiter served our $20 salad on hot plates. Ruining our salad. Dinner was not served until 35 minutes after we had finished salad. 

Will not be back. If you get Kyle as your server. RUN"}
{"text":"We just had the turkey special. Turkey was dry portion were on the small side. Beans were undercooked and the pumpkin pie was a frozen pie quality."}
{"text":"This place used to be good 2 yrs ago but no more.   Went there today for lunch and they gave us the dinner menu.   Food is so bland that couldnt finish eating it.  They skimp on ingredients in pasta dishes and omit some of the listed veggies.   Service was not good either.   never again."}
{"text":"Location in Chandler is far better.  It seems like they forgot our original order.  They brought our 2nd order & mins after we  were done eating, they tried to take our  plates.  I had to say we are still waiting for our order.  We reminded the wsitress several times & she kept saying it is coming out, but we are still waiting.  We haven't seen her in a long time.  They also don't have a blender so don't plan on drinking frozen drinks. Wow they just told me that our ticket was lost.  That's crazy! Horrible service."}
{"text":"I am NOT a restaurant snob.  In general I think Buca is great, with decent food, big portions, and a fun atmosphere to hang out with friends.

But the service at this particular location was pretty bad.  We stopped by to get lunch before a Pirates game, but the place was packed and the line was really long.  We tried again for dinner after the game, and again the wait was very long.  We only got a table right away by being one of the few groups willing to sit on the patio after a very hot day out in the sun.

Our pitcher of sangria came pretty quickly, but we had to spend a good ten minutes staring at it longingly before we got any glasses we could use to actually drink it.  We never got any bread, which I'm pretty sure they automatically serve to every table, right?  None of our drinks were ever refilled (not even the water, which sort of sucked; see above about spending the previous 4 hours in bleacher seats in direct sun).  Our food came after a pretty long wait, and was typical Buca food- tasty by my standards, anyway!  We ordered dessert, but our brownie sundae had no brownies.  That was a pretty big letdown, let me tell you.

Mostly I felt bad for the servers.  It's not like they were just standing around while we waited for food, they were constantly running back and forth and looked really stressed.  There was a big group at the table next to us (a bachelorette party, I think) and they didn't get several of their dishes until well after everyone else at their table had finished eating.  Understandably they sent them back.  Between running to serve all of her tables and trying to apologize to this angry group about a problem that wasn't even her fault, their poor waitress was in tears by the time we left.

From my experience and other reviews, it seems like they are chronically understaffed.  It is a very busy location in a very popular area, and it sounds like the management has not gotten that memo.  The end result is that the customers end up entertaining themselves while they wait for their food by chatting with the other tables about how bad the service is.  That WAS at least entertaining, but not exactly the reason I stopped by."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there Saturday night. There were a couple large parties there. It took us about 45 minutes to get seated and we were told 25-30. Once we were finally seated it was another 10 before our server came to our table who then had the courage to ask if we sat ourselves since she was confused about our presence.  We were in a hurry to get somewhere and told her and she did well getting everything else to us quickly but had a very poor first impression. The food is very expensive for the quality and taste. Most entrees don't include pasta, you have to order that separate. The fettuccini Alfredo was bland and plain. It wasn't terrible but for $55 we could have gotten the same thing at the Olive Garden for $25 and it tastes much better at the OG. We'll not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Went there with a large group and ordered the Chicken Parmesan and Minestrone soup.  The soup was the worst I have ever had in my life.  (no exaggeration).  It was completely inedible.  Other people at our table that ordered it agreed and couldn't eat theirs as well.  I mentioned it to the server and she shrugged it off.  The chicken was decent - not great, but not bad.  When the check came, she had made no effort to take off the soup.  What great customer service!  Before posting on here, I complained privately to corporate.  They clearly don't care about customer service because my complaint was ignored.  If you are looking for medium end Italian food, Olive Garden or Carrabbas are heads and tails above this place.  AVOID!"}
{"text":"David is the absolute best!! Our prom was absolutely amazing with him; couldn't have had a better experience. Great hospitality and service! Thank you David!!"}
{"text":"We came to Buca di Beppo on Christmas day because nobody wanted to cook!  Being that it was Christmas day, this was probably one of the only restaurants that was open and they were sure busy!  Luckily, we had reservations.  Our reservations were for 4:15 and we got there on time and were seated just  minutes after checking in.  We saw others come in without reservations and the wait time was a whopping 2.5 hours.  Ouch.  They were so busy, in fact, that while we waited for our table, we heard the workers say, \"That's it on to-go orders!  No more to-go!\" In addition, we were seated next to the bar and by the time we were leaving (around 6 p.m.) we heard the bartender say that they were pretty much out of everything.  (They were still going to be open another 2-3 hours.)  Lucky for us, none of these things affected our meal.  Our server was nice and efficient.  We enjoyed a long meal starting with bread with oil and vinegar and the calamari appetizer, on to the apple and gorgonzola salad and minestrone soup, followed by our main course of Chicken Parmesan and some kind of spicy Penne dish.  I imagine that the busy staff must've felt stressed and pressure to turn tables, but we never felt rushed and were able to enjoy our meal.  They did not cut any corners on the food or service and to me, everything seemed on par with a normal night here.  I'd happily come back on another Christmas day, keeping in mind that reservations are a necessity and the earlier, the better to avoid not being able to get what you want because of potential food or drink shortages."}
{"text":"Great place for a large group.  We celebrated my Easter birthday here and had such a nice time.  The food was delicious (love the salads), and the service was wonderful.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Not big on reviewing chains, but I really like this place. The atmosphere and staff are what did it for me; I like the deep Italian American feel of this place, with the pictures on the wall depicting the feel of the old country with the garnish of Americana (pics of Sinatra, Hepburn, stuff like that). Staff is ultra-nice and they give you a tour of the kitchen so you can inspect its cleanliness before you even eat; impressive, to me.

The food's not the best Italian I've ever had, and the price is kinda high, but it's definitely passable in the taste dept. Plus, like I said: The atmosphere makes it."}
{"text":"We thought we had a reservation......we were 25 people.......we all showed up for dinner but.......Buca wasn't ready or able to seat us for a half hour. when they finally tried to seat us there wasn't enough seats, it took another 15 minutes to get my family seated at 3 different tables for a \"family style\" dinner. The Buca di Peppo family must be a dysfunctional family! We were at this restaurant for over an hour before we were even able to place our drink orders (3 tables worth) and because we were seated by the bar instead of one of there group rooms we had to deal with the other large group(s) that were waiting for their group room to become available. I was waiting for a manager to come and offer an apology but this never happened. There was one server for our 3 tables and he had the help from a couple bus persons but it was obvious that they were also taking care of other customers. Our 3 tables were served dinner at different times. They were slow to seat us, they were slow to take our drink orders, they were slow to bring us our appetizers, they were very slow to come back after they served the appetizers to take our dinner orders and then they served us a different times. This is NOT how my family does family style. Buca at 412 E. Flamingo in Las Vegas if I thought you gave a damn about your customers coming back I would call the manager and give him/her a piece of my mind. This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in Las Vegas and lived there for almost 30 years. Congrats Buca! ....oh I never talked about the food. Well if you still want to know about the food after knowing how bad their service is, here it goes..... 

We ordered the Cheesy Florentine Toast that wasn't bad, the appetizer trio (calamari, fried mozzarella & stuffed mushrooms) was pretty good. For entrees we ordered Spicy Chicken Rigatoni which I liked, we also ordered the Chicken Limone...very good and we had the spaghetti and meatballs, not enough sauce and the meatballs should have been called meat loafs, they were tasty but nothing like any meatballs I've ever had. One our tables ordered the eggplant parm and it was pretty good from a guy who confesses to not like eggplant very much. 

Bottom line....if you have a big group and are looking for a place to have a family style meal out in Las Vegas......KEEP LOOKING!"}
{"text":"I am allergic to eggs and even after mentioning it several times to the waitress, she didn't took it seriously. Not even once but this happened thrice and when the fourth time I ordered Eggplant Parmesan, they revealed we always put eggs in it. Why the hell you didn't listen to my concern correctly and take the order seriously since last three times.
I never give one star to any restaurant, but not even a single thing I could find nice in this restaurant. I will never visit this place again.
This is not a restaurant actually, it looks like somebody's home and there is only one cook who takes hours to prepare a single dish."}
{"text":"The food is not very good, so expensive and they don't even listen to the customer's concerns properly."}
{"text":"I will never eat here! My family and I just tried to order food to go on Christmas Eve an hour and a half before closing and we were rudely turned away. First we called to see if they were open and they informed us that they were. I told the woman on the phone that we were going to look over the menu and call right back. When we called back 3 minutes later the woman on the phone now had an attitude and with the most disgusting tone I've ever encountered she quickly told me that they were busy and weren't taking any more to go orders. I said I don't understand we just called and were told you don't close until 9 (it was 7:30 at the time) she said Oh, and placed on hold for 15 minutes just to come by and quickly dismiss us again with a \"yeah sorry we're not taking anymore orders!\". I've never eaten here and can't speak on the food but I will NEVER eat at a place that treats people this way, especially on a holiday."}
{"text":"Came at about 5:30 yesterday and waited about 5 minutes for the hostess to show up at the front.  It wasn't even busy, maybe 6 tables had patrons.  After getting seated the service was even slower. Took a while to get our drinks and oil for the bread. Appetizer took over 15 minutes to arrive and the main course took even longer. The food was delicious and that is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars. I've never had service like this at the Excalibur location. The manager was very disappointed when I mentioned this but offered nothing. I mentioned to him that another table looked disgusted with the slow service."}
{"text":"We came here once.  We waited longer than the quoted time.  They did bring out pizza to satisfy a little bit of our hunger.  When they do take you to your table, they take you through the kitchen so you can see what is going on.  They even have a table in there that you can request to eat at.  We were placed near the bar, and it was very loud.  There are also pictures all over the walls.  A majority of them are of nude women.  I don't know about you, but I am not bringing my children to a place where they have pictures of nude women on the walls.

The food was good.  It is served \"family\" style.  One dish will serve 2-3 people.  It is cooked with a lot of garlic though.

We went once and that was enough for us."}
{"text":"It was about 3 years ago,

this restaurant made me wait 2 hours for a cold dish that they serve to us on the patio outside next to the dumpsters... when I complained to management about the location of our table near the dumpster, he told me and my guest that we should try this place when it's not so busy if we want nice seating.

never again will i be in this trough...

I have blacklisted this place and use it as an example of poor customer service."}
{"text":"I was at the Az School of RE and had only 45 minutes for lunch.The service was great, but my lunch was inexpensive and delicious. I will return. Great find!!!!"}
{"text":"Last week celebrated a friends birthday with her.  The food is always delicious here!  I did find Jarrett, our waiter to be a little pushy.  The minute he heard we were celebrating a birthday he immediately pushed the deserts on us before even taking our dinner order.  And then trying to push an appetizer on us.  Even after saying no, he continued to push (NO means NO!).  He also asked if we would give 5 stars on yelp if we liked the service because the trainee who was with him would receive a free dinner if they got a certain amount of 5 star reviews on yelp.  When I have dinner with a friend I want the conversation to be between the people I am with and not have constant interruptions from the waiter.  It's one thing to come to the table to see if everything is ok, it's another to participate uninvited into the conversation."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for them is the food. Service here needs immediate improvement.  20 minutes to get our non - alcoholic drinks and another 15 minutes to get our cocktails.  For being a slow night, and I mean only 4 tables including us in the whole restaurant, is way below standards.  Our food took almost an hour but that was expected,  considering how big the plates were.  It would of made a difference if the manager was touching tables instead of hiding in the kitchen.  I don't recommend this location to anyone.  Take the extra mile and go to a different location for a better experience."}
{"text":"We are a family of 6 with 4 kids under 7. Needless to say it can easily be a shit-show when we go out. Tonight we went to Buca's. We had a good time and really good food, but what made our night awesome was our waiter Adrian. We will NOT be going back unless he is there! He did a really good job making sure everyone had everything they needed even though he was SUPER busy with quite a few tables and several large parties. He still made time to take photos for us, our order was perfect and most importantly he was so very kind & patient. He's a dad who works hard for his family and it shows. I suggest you request him next time you stop by, I promise your night  will be 10x better if you do."}
{"text":"We all felt sick all night ...wasn't impressed especially for the price. Don't order the cosmo fizz it's super tart and not enjoyable. I didn't eat very much because I don't eat a lot of pasta and still felt sick all night ....can't see ever going back."}
{"text":"After everything I went through with my fist experience we gave it a second chance and it turned GREAT! We had food delivered to my home and since I didn't call ahead I was told the delivery time frame would be 2 hours. They made it so simple and easy to place the order over the phone. After just 1 hour and a half my food did arrive and the delivery girl was very nice. Only thing is my pizza was cold, other than that the food was great!"}
{"text":"Dirty plates and hair in food. Salad was decent. Entree and appetizer were comped. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Bad costumer service! Waiter Named hector got our mashed Potato order wrong twice. when the food was ready he gave us the food in our hand to put on the table.  SMH"}
{"text":"The hostess gave a bad first impression.  She said it would be 45 more minutes because our \"table was dirty,\" when we were one of only around 4 groups in the whole restaurant.  The restaurant made me feel like I was in a maze based on the movie Angels & Demons.  The décor was very creepy and all I could think about was how dusty it all looked.  

The food was hit or miss.  I liked the salad dressing and the bread (not the mozzarella bread), but the baked ziti was dry, tough, and very skimpy on the sauce.  The worst part was the $24 for a carafe of sangria, which turned out extremely watered down since it was filled halfway up with ice.  

I was glad they could seat our whole family on a few hours notice, but now I can tell why they had the availability."}
{"text":"Our server Jarrett was literally amazing I suggest if you want to go here ask for him he will make your Buca di Beppo experience worth while. Me and my family never stoped smiling"}
{"text":"My girl took me there for a late lunch.  We had the \"Supremo\"  A W E S O M E  ! ! !   She's not  a \"Pizza-person\" however,  she did recommend this one.

The service was quick and friendly.  We wanted for nothing.  Our waitress was Janine.  She was great as well.  Very friendly.  Greeted us with her beautiful smile.  Smiling throughout.  Thank you, for serving us Janine.  We will be sure to ask for you next time."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed

We have eaten at Buca Di Beppo in Seattle and have always had a very positive experience; great service and great food. So we were really surprised by our experience at this location.

We had a relatively large party (13 people) but were seated quickly and they worked with us to arrange seating so that we were all together. Our server was pleasant. While not rude, she was not very helpful and did not display the upbeat demeanor that we had every other time we have eaten at a Buca's. Had this been the only shortcoming, we would have overlooked it. Unfortunately, when the food came we were in for more disappointments and let-downs.

The salads (chopped, Caesar, and Apple-Gorgonzola) were good ( a bit less flavorful than we have had in the past, but good).

With the exception of the Chicken Parm, the entrees were bland, under-cooked, and for several of the dishes, cold. Even with the wine and Sangria, these dishes were hard to eat and not at all enjoyable.

So sadly, we will neither return no
e recommend this location."}
{"text":"Resturant was not very busy but the service was quite slow. My daughter and I wanted a pizza and surprised at the cost for a pizza. It was basically like flat bread with cheese. The bread they brought out was cold and seemed like could have been sitting there most of the day.
I did receive a call from their DM this morning about our experience at this location last night after a survey I filled out on line. Very impressed with their promptness in responding to complaints."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. The waitress was loud and annoying. The decor is a time warp back to the early 90s. Would never eat there again."}
{"text":"Excellent service; small portions are big enough to share; excellent Caesar salad and good chocolate chip cannolis."}
{"text":"The food was ok. We got the baked ziti and meatballs, both of which I would order again if I ever go back. We also ordered the florentine cheese bread which was not worth the money. It was ok but the free house bread was better."}
{"text":"I had called in at 11am the morning of 2/7/15 for a 'to go ' order  for a group of 25 people at my home. Spent a good 30minutes on the phone to jut place my order ( as I was placed on hold 4 times ! ) I requested that my order be ready for med to pick up at 5.30pm .
When I arrived to pick up - I was asked my name and asked to sit at the bar while they were getting my order out . I paid for my order and waited ! After about 20mins the bartender went to check 'what was taking so long' and came back and told me 'it should be out shortly' Another 15mins went by and when my order still had not come out, I asked what the delay was . To my disbelief - I was told now that ' my order was -not put in ' !!!  The manager came to talk and asked 'who ' I had had placed the order with /what time etc and I gave him all the details. Apparently the moron who took my order that morning had 'not placed the order' and now was conveniently 'gone' for the day. They had 'charged' me for someone else's order !!! By now it was 6.10pm - and there was no trace of my order ! My guests were to be arriving at my home by 7pm  ! The manager  , asked if I wanted to 'put the order in now ' , I really had NO choice at this point and asked if he could then have the food delivered. He promptly said \"No ! I don't have drivers that are free !!!' I had remained calm through this entire drama but by now was getting quite frustrated as it seemed like 'no one really cared !!'
In the meanwhile -the lady who's order I had paid for -arrived to pick her food up. This was not ready either and she was 'over the top ' -creating a BIG scene !!
The manager was visibly shaken and tried to calm her -apologizing etc...
It was 6,40pm by now and I am still waiting for them to 'cancel ' the previous charges on my credit card and ring up my new invoice.
The manager settled down the lady who 'making a big noise' first and then took care of my check. I asked for a confirmation to make sure the previous charges were void but was told 'I had to take his word for it- they was no print out to show me'.
Manager now told me he was 'writing off two items from my order AND would deliver the food to my house after all !! It was almost 7pm and I to rush out as my guests were arriving at my house already ! 
The food did arrive to my house at 8.30pm missing the bread eventually ! 

I am extremely disappointed with how my situation was handled and how I was treated . I was there for almost  1 and a 1/2 hr !!!
I am not one to 'scream' and 'demand' things or 'create a scene'  !! I understand that 'human errors' can happen and was really working with the team there to just make the best of my 'situation gone wrong' . It believe would have only been fair for them to have offered to have my order 'on the house' as this was totally the fault of their moron employee and the should have offered to deliver it right away ! 

Not only will I not go or order from Buca di Beppo but ALL my guests (25 + people) were horrified by this experience of mine and have vowed NOT to ever go there or order from there ever again .TOO BAD as ALL of us live around them and have OFTEN ordered for our large get togethers ."}
{"text":"Every patron obviously had a different experience than us, because we had a good time! Our server Brittney was very attentive and nice! The food came out one right after the other. We made reservations online and when we got there we were seated immediately. 

The mixed green salad didn't \"wow\" me for $13 (small size). I wouldn't order that again. 

The garlic bread and cheese bread was good. We ordered the \"make your own pasta\" --price was decent for a large. Overall satisfied!"}
{"text":"The only reason I would rate this a one is because there's not a zero our waiter was horrible service was lousy we were given the wrong bill the deal was tougher than shoe leather not that I've ever eaten shoe leather but I think I just tried it I would not recommend this to anyone visiting or living in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Visited this place last night. Very disappointed with the food quality. This place brags on quantity (family style) and I guess that's all. We had chopped salad - was too much dressing but ok. Shrimp Scampi was bland and watery. The \"garlic\" bread that came with it was cold and greasy and no signs of garlic. The bread seemed to have been some left-overs from the weekend. Spaghetti and Meatballs were tasteless and the sauce was watery and bland, I had to order the meat sauce on the side to add more taste. The noodles were soggy fat and over cooked. Overall, it was the worst Italian ever with a hefty price tag. We should have gone across the street. Again, what did I really expect from a chain. It's really hard finding good Italian in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The waiter was great....but other than that.....we were seated at a table that we too big for us and we couldn't talk to each other well, in a sort of alcove that was painted with faux roman scenes that were on the violent side-- really a little creepy.  The salad was good -- the rest was not.    Plenty of other restaurants nearby -- go to those."}
{"text":"Very much like a family-style Olive Garden. The only difference I detect is the decor, which is nice. The food is subpar for the price but not bad. Not really notable either. I would say that the atmosphere here is the draw. They do have a great happy hour and it is conveniently located in our hotel. They need to work on their service, however. Our group of 11 was told to check back in 30 minutes to be seated; which we did. When we returned we were made to feel as though it was a strain to \"fit\" us in. We were ignored, waited another 15 minutes to be seated although the table was ready. When we were, our waiter hardly ever came to check on us. I'm not sure if he felt overwhelmed by our group or what, he looked over at us frequently but never actually came to refill drinks. I had to go find the hostess to send someone over. We always tip %20 and probably would have more if we had been better taken care of. 

In short, the food is generic and somewhat over priced. $5 wines are pretty awesome, the atmosphere is nice but the service stinks."}
{"text":"Very bad this time. Came last week by myself and the food & service was decent. Came back tonight and was just plain horrible. Had to wait for a table when there were clearly some available. Took 20 mins to get an iced tea refill. Ordered the Steak Milanese and it looked like someone threw up on the plate. The meat was over cooked and chewy. Told the waitress and she called the manager who took another 15 mins to come to our table. He was very nice and took care of this part of half the bill. But the waitress looked like she hated being at her job and took forever to get the bill after the manager came by. Not to mention the table of screaming kids next to us. Very bad experience, but only in town for business."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start.  Mid-week. The place was EMPTY!!!!  

Online reservation made for lunch. Arrive with confirmation email in hand & the hostess ARGUED with us stating we did not have a reservation. 

Original server was so bad one if the managers took over as our server and she wasn't much better. Items ordered were never received and even after pointing this out, we STILL didn't get them, yet we were charged for missing items & they refused to take it off our bill. 

The food was mediocre at best. My first and last time here.   Never again. How this place is open & has such a loyal following beats me."}
{"text":"POOP ALERT!!  BEWARE!!! So my hubby and were having our house fumigated for termites so we thought, \"Let's go to Vegas for a short vacation.\"  We were having a great time at the Mandalay and shopping at the outlet.  On Fri March 27 2015 we decided to have a late dinner at Bucca since were familiar with the great food at the location at Universal City.  There was a wait at the location at Excalibur as there is at the one we normally go to.  We didn't mind.  The service was great.  We had the green salad and garlic bread, delicious.  Then came the lasagna.  It was good but then something happened.  We both felt bloated very quickly.  We had a lot left over so we decided to take it with us. Both my husband and I had a horrible night with stomach cramps and nausea.  In the middle of the night I ran to the bathroom to vomit but didn't make it to the toilet and ended hurling in one of the sinks. I tried to hold it back with my hands but my body rejected the obvious bacteria that permeated all of the layers of the lasagna.  Moments later my husband started vomiting also.  So all night we took turns vomiting violently.  There was a beautiful couple across from us that were also having lasagna.  I just hope they weren't on their honey moon. Day three,  my wonderful husband and I are back home and still recuperating, our backs and rib cages sore from the force of the vomiting.  I'd also like to mention that my husband and I don't drink alcohol. So the vomiting can't be attributed to being intoxicated. I'm writing this review because a child or elderly person could suffer serious results from food poisoning.  We will never go to a Bucca di Beppo again.  Too bad because we often celebrated birthdays and other social events at the Universal location.  We just aren't willing to take the chance and besides, Italian food doesn't sound that appealing any more."}
{"text":"Excellent southern Italian style dishes. Food is served family style so a small portion will feed two people. Avoid anything made with aioli as they do not do a good job with this."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the entire experience!  The service, the food, the atmosphere, EVERYTHING!

We highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Came here recently with a group of 4 people. We loved the food! We were happy to find a Buca di Beppo in Las Vegas strip. This location was great! The service was fast and the food was delicious. I highly recommend it for families and anyone in Las Vegas. Highly recommend making a reservation to avoid waiting for a table."}
{"text":"We come here for every birthday in the family and we have NEVER been disappointed. The staff is always so friendly, the food is always fabulous and everyone leaves with a smile on their face."}
{"text":"Had a great experience there.  Went for my early birthday celebration. Yes I'm a leo and love my birthday so I have more than one celebration. Had a reservation for 4 at 715pm. Arrived at 645pm and they got us seated within a few minutes was fully expecting to have to wait. They were nice enough to seat us downstairs which was a relief since my 92 year old Grandma was with and I forgot to ask for that in my reservation. The service was a little slow at first but it was very busy in there so no problem.  Christina the waitress was very sweet and helpful. Got our Apple salad and it was yummy.  Took awhile for the pizza to come but she explained they were baked up in the kitchen. I didn't mind waiting when people give legimite reasons.  She came back and told us our last course preccitto chicken they dropped one chicken and that they had no more but they would comp it and bring us another piece of any other chicken also comped. So even though we were there longer than expected they made it enjoyable and the food was fantastic.  Props to amazing customer service by the kitchen,  waitress and management. Will definitely come again.  Oh and the free birthday cake they are doing for summer birthdays was good also.  Great place."}
{"text":"First time going there and I was pleasantly surprised. You get a lot of food for a reasonable price. Their pizza is pretty gosh darn good too. The waiter we had was extremely helpful as well. Was very honest about what to (and not to) order"}
{"text":"Food as always was excellent but waitress was beyond awful! She did not welcome us or ask if we've been here before (which we've always been asked at every Buca we've gone to). Her only words were \"What can I get you to drink?\" She didn't offer us bread, had to ask another server for bread who happily brought it out to us. Had to get our own oil and vinegar. She did not once ask if we were okay or refill our drinks even after we put the empty cups near the edge so she could see walking buy. We flagged her down to order dessert and she walked away while we were ordering dessert to get something and said go ahead I can hear you. Finally asked her for refill on husband's lemonade when she brought dessert and she filled it with water. We go to Buca for the food and the experience, and if we had not had wonderful service in the past (Austin is spectacular!) we would never go back. We have servers in the family and love to tip well for good service, I've never left such a poor tip, hoping she got the message."}
{"text":"The food was good. We had the calamari which was WAY over priced. It was your average run of the mill, but the sauce dip was very good. Then we had the mixed seafood linguine (forgot the name) and it was good, a little overpriced and could have used a little more shrimp. Our daughter had the single serving of manicotti - she loved it and it was appropriately priced. Our little one had the kids spaghetti and meatball, very good and a nice sized portion. Very nice design of the restaurant. Benny was our server, outside on the patio. He was great and definitely a great ambassador for the restaurant. The ladies room needs attention, Iock didn't work on the door for the handicap stall, never good.  Also, paper towel machines need replacing. There was a fan on the patio that needed replaced as well. Would have given 4 stars if it wasn't overpriced."}
{"text":"Stupidly huge portions of amazingly good Italian food.  Really good waiter and staff.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Currently I am sitting here and waiting for my food for almost 1 hour... it's only me and my wife...and placed only two simple orders... horrible service. .. can't believe it takes more than hour to serve us food..."}
{"text":"Let's just say we left after forty five minutes. The place was empty and where was our food? I know it does not take forty minutes to cook fish. When we're said we  needed to leave because we had to be somewhere by six they brought out the food. Cold. Hence, we did not have dinner."}
{"text":"Came to this Buca for dinner; food is the same in all Buca's, I love their olive oil and the balsamic vinager with the bread basket they serve. As with all Buca's their meals are meant to be shared even the small portions, so that's nice. Their spaghetti and meat balls are not my favorite but I was told by others in my group that for them it was, so I guess it a taste thing. Their salads are good and crispy not soggy and bland like in other restaurants. Had their Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken... delicious, the sauce was on point and the chicken tender and juicy, and the prosciutto (bacon) was crispy but not hard. Also tried the Chicken Saltimbocca... the sauce was different with a tangy kick from the lemon and matched the way the chicken was cooked but it was not my favorite, a little to tangy and lemony for my taste. Their drinks are reasonably priced and they have a good selection of wine. Our waiter was nice and attentive, he definitely earned his tip. Lost one star because you could smell the smoke from the casino and that may have been why I didn't enjoy the food like at a regular Buca."}
{"text":"The few times I've gone here, I have really enjoyed it. The employees there are always so welcoming with a smile. About the food, what can I say, its delicious. I recommend getting the Baked Ziti. When I went here for the first time and ate the Baked Ziti I really enjoyed the flavor and especially the cheese. By the way if your a cheese lover, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Entire restaurant had two tables - mine and one other.  Staff that was suppose to seat guest had to be torn away from her phone in order to get a seat.  Strange odor - musty old smell.  Other table was trying to check out and the bartender and manager (?) were too busy with health inspectors to even let them pay their bill.  My bread - which came out promptly was stone cold but the eggplant Parmesan was very good ... but could use more cheese but that's just my preference.  Not sure it's worth another try but perhaps the inspectors had them off their normal routine."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Food was amazing. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Went in for lunch. Chef Zach made some amazing pasta"}
{"text":"it's decent. don't expect anything amazing: it's pasta. :P"}
{"text":"The food was really great!! Servers are happy and joyful, but the food takes soooo long!!! Family style be prepared for a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since I graduated 4 years ago! Great family place! Big portions, Great for sharing! We had the Mozzarella Caprese, Linguine Frutti de Marre and for desert we had the Chicilate chip Cannoli! Overall, it was good! Felt good to be back in a place that feels like home away from home! Service was a little slow but hey fogetaboutit!"}
{"text":"Great family style italian food. Try the apple gorganzola salad. Avoid the pizza but everything else is good."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and had a great time and enjoyed the food along with the service. Our waitress was PAULA and she took care of us with excellent hospitality. Just cause of her I wanna go there again soon."}
{"text":"Die Pizza ist gut und nicht so fettig, dick, amerikanisch. Die small Portionen reichen locker für 2 Personen und sind geschmacklich gut."}
{"text":"We needed a restaurant for our rehearsal dinner that could seat/feed 15 people for cheap. Buca is the only place in town that I know of that can keep it cheap, huge portions and allow us to get as loud as we want.  

The waitstaff was good and kept on top of everything.  The food was typical Italian, nothing special, though my hubby loved the pizza and I loved the chicken parmagiana. The tiramisu leaves a lot to be desired. I won't order that again.  We fed 8 people, with liquor and dessert (no appetizer) and took the leftovers home for $110. I don't think you can beat the price.

Making a reservation seems to be a difficult task for them. I made it a month in advance, and I called back a week prior to the event to confirm it. Dominique said the reservation wasn't in the book, so she wrote it in. We got to Buca and while we were there, someone from Buca called my cell phone to tell me that because I was running late, they could only hold my reservation another 5 minutes.  It seems like the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty, service was horrendous. In her defense, they forced the bartender to be our waitress on a busy Friday night. Not her fault, but definitely poor management. Definitely wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The waitress was super aggresive the first 5 minutes we were there, then we did not see her again for an hour. We sat with food we hadnt touched in 40 minutes with no waitstaff in sight to give us boxes...when we finally did get our boxes and asked for the check it took another 20 minutes to get it. Then the cc machine was down and it took another 20 minutes to get a reciept. They ended up charging my card almost 3 months later!! What a waste of time and money. I have had great experiences with other locations but this almost makes me not want to go back to any of them."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to Buca.  I have eaten here many times in the past 5 years both with friends and with my church group for which I am the social coordinator.  I have gotten take out meals and only had great things to say about this restaurant in the past.  The food was and is still good but not worth the treatment one now receives as a guest. 

 The wait staff had a total disregard and lack of respect for the patrons that was appalling.  Ours was poorly trained and had no back up or bus person.  Bread came out after the salad with no oil. By the time oil came, our bread was mostly gone.  We watched our desserts melt as we had neither spoons or plates to eat on.  I had dirty utensils dropped on me all while we froze to death after multiple requests to turn the air conditioning down.  After 4 requests a manager told us it had been done.  Within the hour it returned to meat locker status.  My church friends with arthritis were miserable and in pain due to the cold.  I had to go outside to try and warm up during my meal. I guess it was comfortable for the wait staff and those that may have been drinking alcohol.  For the rest it was a miserable an noisy environment.  It takes a lot for me to have to write this, but I was in tears thinking how my friend's Birthday celebration was ruined.  Needless to say  I will not be back nor will the groups I used to bring there."}
{"text":"Ate there with a group of 13. Not sure what the issue was but waitress was replaced right after we ordered which resulted in our appetizers not being delivered correctly and slow service. Then, manager came by to see how everything turned out --when we told her we had not yet gotten our food --she was quick to retort \"you have appetizers and drinks!\" without a further care and left. Why did she even ask? 

The food was awful, service slow, and you are supposed to go there when you have a large group. Clearly they weren't prepared to handle a large group on a Saturday night. 

Oh and their gluten free options leave much to be desired --horrible choices and the food was awful. We finally asked them to just saute some shrimp in some butter for my 9yo GFree son --that took forever to do but that was something he would eat. 

Don't bother going there --not worth it at all -"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and wasn't disappointed! Came in on a Friday night with a party of 9 and was sat in no time! We even had two little kiddos with us! Jarret was our server and he's extremely friendly and a great server! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Good food but pricey. No salad with entry, just cold bread. Very large portions"}
{"text":"Very good pesto cream pasta! Erin was a great server. It took too long to get a table - we saw empty tables when we washed our hands before being seated - but otherwise it was a good meal."}
{"text":"Management and servers standing around. We saw our server Annie sneeze in the kitchen and then 5 seconds later walk out with a tray of food. We were here for lunch and it was pretty dead so it's not like she could even use the excuse of being busy. It was just I sneezed, now I serve. We ordered a salad, the chicken saltimboca, and spaghetti and meatballs to share between 4 people. The salad was pretty good. Salami on it was yummy, but it wasn't anything impressive. The chicken was meh at best - $23 plate (and that's for the small!) of 3 lonely chicken breasts sitting in a puddle of lemon butter sauce. No pasta, no wow factor except the price. The spaghetti and meatballs was bland and mostly noodles. AND it was $20. Ridiculous. 
We've come here many times for dinner at this location and one in San Diego and always loved it, but after today's lunch experience, don't think we'll be going back. We can make better Italian food at home for much less money."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time on New Year's Eve night. Our server was great! A little disappointed because we are all Coke drinkers and they only serve Pepsi, but that's besides the point. Our bread was cold, one of our pasta dishes were lacking in the sauce and chicken department. The plates are large, but overpriced since the majority of it is pasta. Ordered the appetizer meatballs we loved. I definitely wouldn't go back unless I had a coupon. A cute place to visit at least once, who knows, they had tons to choose from, perhaps we didn't order the right meal. :/"}
{"text":"We had a great experience.  Jarrett was our server and we couldn't ask for a better server. Very attentive ... always right there to refill our drinks. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok where to start...As the picture said not enough chicken for your money. Maybe if it had pasta. But speaking of the pasta, the stuffed shells had no sauce,  the rigatoni was too spicy for most of our crowd, but the parmesan was good. The caprese had almost green tomatos and was not a great portion size. They were not expecting us to eat anything as they provided no serving utensils until we asked and asked and asked every time they brought out a dish. Mama got a soup spoon to dish out the Alfredo sauce that was requested on the side. Took her forever to pass the bowl!!!!! All in all though the Pope Room was fun.....some slightly creepy pictures and a head under glass...but we wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Food was really good and just a ton of food so plan on taking some home.  Deserts were just OK."}
{"text":"Good food great for groups good service only down side it is a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Food was great. However the service wasn't that great. We were there for over 2 hrs. The waiter wasn't very friendly. It felt as if he was rushing us and looked frustrated when we asked questions. Experience not enjoyable at all."}
{"text":"The food service and atmosphere was fantastic, but the italian soda that they make in the restaurant is a little bit to sweet I had the strawberry and it tasted like drinking candy. The lasagna was amazing."}
{"text":"In January we renewed our vows and had a large group with us for the celebration.  I worked with Ivette West and she was wonderful in setting up the reservation, food selection and even helped to accommodate the one veggitarian in a family full of carnivores.  We had such a wonderful time and everyone enjoyed the food.  The staff just rolled with the group's antics and even joined in creating a memorable evening for all.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Took my parents and inlaws there for Thanksgiving. All of us were stuck to the toilet for the following 36 hours. Stay away. It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"I went into Buca di Beppo today for lunch and it was so dead. Now I know why! I ordered off the lunch menu and added a side salad for 99 cents which I thought was great, but I do not like olives or onions and asked to NOT have them on my salad. Sure enough I was brought a salad with onions and olives...since it was lunch time and I was on a time crunch I picked them out but I could still taste the onions :( The server didn't say anything about me piling them on the bread plate. Good thing I didn't like the plain, cold, and stale bread anyway. My food was alright, but again kind of plain! Will not be going back here for Italian Food!"}
{"text":"Got my bill and was charged $14.00 for a Margarita...strike one.
No bartender,so had to wait for the server had to make the drink....strike 2.
Sorry,only one chef in today...Insane wait in an empty restaurant....strike 3
My eggplant supposed to serve 3,only 2 pieces for $25.00....your out.

Not enough staff to even run the place.

This place is a joke,edible food but the prices and the service is total garbage.2 small dishes and one cocktail was $70+...no appetizer or anything else with it."}
{"text":"I just want to say that manager Todd really went above and beyond for us tonight! He is the example of every manger should be! We were lucky enough to dine at the kitchen table tonight and it sure was a great experience to see/eat behind the scenes. Our server Alyssa, was so mellow, personable and to the point. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread and baked ziti pasta! We left stuffed yet satisfied! Thank you so much Todd and Alyssa, A++++!"}
{"text":"Hit or Miss.
But I won't take my chances.

It really depend who's the server, and who's the chef.

Avoid the fat grumpy mean looking woman server with the broad face.
(brunette, pink-ish skin tone, very shaped eyebrows that look angry)
Holy *** the fat mean looking waitress with the blocky eyebrows will eat you alive, regurgitate, and chew you up and then spit you out.

Stay away.
She's brash, unattentive, and discriminates against certain customers.
She was continuously kissing @$$ to the customers next to us but treating my group of four with disrespect and contempt.
I doesn't feel great to be discriminated against.
As a customer, we're all spending money there, and I think we deserve the service we pay for.

~*~* aside from that one waitress... *~*~*
the other servers seem fine.
The greeters are friendly.

Food is either hit or miss.
50/50 chance of getting excellent food vs. bland food.
Over the years, the quality went down.

I really wouldn't risk it and rather go to the Chandler location if I could"}
{"text":"Server Jarrett was awesome! We celebrated 6 birthdays and he was so enthusiastic and joked around with us the whole time. Food was excellent and came out super fast. HE DESERVES THE $25 GIFT CARD BECAUSE HE HAS 6 CHILDREN TO FEED!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh boy what a disaster.  On a slow Tuesday night, the place is empty yet I waited over half an hour for my meal!  The pizza came out like warm and had clearly been sitting out.  Terrible service and terrible food, no wonder this place was empty!"}
{"text":"At this location the service was terrible. It took over an hour to get our 2 pasta dishes and the waitress brought us the wrong drinks on two different occasions. Not to mention she was very rude and short with us. 
We asked about food multiple times because it was taking so long and she brushed us off and told us she will have her manager come over. (This happened twice). When food finally arrived they brought us the wrong dish and we ended up having to wait even longer. I would be more understanding if these were complicated dishes but the fact that it was pasta made this even more ridiculous.
Overall it was a poor experience with bad service and average food. Hopefully they read these reviews and work on changing the way they run this Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout yesterday: large salad, spaghetti and lasagna.  Salad was delicious.  Lasagna had a taste to it, kinda gross.  I individually tried all the components; the noodles, ricotta, cheese, meat.  It was the meat.  Didn't taste like real meat, tasted like it had a bunch of... fillers in it?  I'm not sure what it was but I ended up throwing mine away.  Didn't even try the spaghetti because it too had meat in it.  Disappointed.  Was going to order for our holiday party at work, but not from here."}
{"text":"We had reservations on Christmas Day and when we arrived were told they were running behind 40mins. Why even take reservations? Service was lacking and had to wait another 20 mins to get our drinks. When we asked for balsamic vinegar we were told he could not leave it at the table, we had to use it right away and give it back to him. Very strange. Food is deceit but way over priced."}
{"text":"Ordered the bruschetta and spaghetti and meatballs. Bruschetta bread really hard. Spaghetti was bland and meatball was hard.  The service was bad. No napkins and only saw waiter twice. Yeah we sat quick at the bar but would rather pass on it and go to sbarro at the food court."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!!! Carolina or karolina was really rude.!! Hire a better manager!!! Never again!! Carolina didn't want to serve us. Yet again worst service ever!!!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, it really is the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had. I don't know what it is about Buca's, but I LOVE spaghetti in general. I had even been to the Old Spaghetti Factory just 2 days before my visit to Buca. Buca's spaghetti kiiiinda blew OSF's outta the water. It was soooo good. In fact I'm craving it right now! Me and my girlfriend split a small and I still had leftovers for the next day, and I eat ALOT. Will be returning."}
{"text":"It is best for a family style dinner, as portions are large, the staff are friendly, and we did not have to wait long. The pasta and the salad was so so. The egg plant parm was the best that I had in a long time. The cheese cake is good, and the decor is old but friendly."}
{"text":"I am a food critic from Atlanta - here in Pittsburgh on business.  Stopped into this place briefly.   Hoping to find a bite before my next call.  Simply put - this place is a rat-hole.  I was sitting at the bar where the gnats had more than 100 x the patronship.  Somebody from\"Corporate\" was here training - and the one table they had was neglected.  The mom found menus for her kids.  I travel ALL the time and can relate to restaurants - this one - don't bother.  Instead go to Bar Louie which is across the street."}
{"text":"I love their pizza and lasagna. I have tried their white sangria and loved it. Hated the red one. Loved the baked zit. That is all that I have tried but would go again just for their pizza is fantastic! Have waited there for along time when I couldn't see why and others got seated quickly. Sometimes we go and have great service and a few times not so great. But overall I add this place to one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"As usual great food and service. Food was at the right temperature and tasteful. Fallon is always delightful and cheerful"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. Cute kitschy place. Service was good- 4 stars.  Food was ok. Stuffed mushrooms- delish. 

I found it to be overpriced. Lasagna was slightly burned. Much better cold the next day. A granny apple salad was good but not $13.00 good.

Bread was very plain. 

Would we return? Probably not."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch.  We had to wait for a table even though there were lots empty.  The explanation was that there were not enough servers?!
The sign outside said lunch from $8.99.  But the lunch menu had nothing less than $11.99!!
My wife ordered the cannelloni.  Two !! arrived in a small amount of white sauce.  No garnish, no bread, that's it!
My lasagna arrived. A tiny portion, maybe about 3\" by 4\" with a little red sauce.  Again, no garnish, no bread.  It was barely room temperature.  I sent it back for some heat.  It was returned to me hot, but it had been microwaved!!!  How could a restaurant possibly think that is OK?  I refused to pay.
I spoke to the manager on the way out.  He couldn't understand why I didn't pay for nuked, mediocre, food!!!  He actually thought it was OK!!!
If you want Buca, go to the one on Flamingo East."}
{"text":"I have been to Buca di Beppo in other cities and have never been disappointed, but this place is definitely off my list. We had one waiter for our table of twenty and he was working other tables as well. We could not get his attention to order a second drink. Our entree arrived at the table after others in our party were finished with their meal and paying their bill. Two side items never arrived. This service ruined our entire evening.  His lack of attention to our table was unacceptable. I spoke to manager afterward and was given an apology, but the entire meal for the two of us should have been comped. Will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is distinctively Old World Italian. The garlic cheese bread is phenomenal. The salad has feta cheese and jalapeños. The sausage is spicy and filling. We topped it all off with pasta and the most outstanding meatballs ever."}
{"text":"Well where do I start, had family come into town so we decided to eat on the strip, they didn't want to go to a buffet so we decided to try this place out. First of its in the crummy Excalber hotel which if it was my choice I wouldn't even step foot in there, now I've had Italian food at Olive Garden before and I expected this place to be the same but for my disappointment the flavor of both the chicken Alfredo and the chicken Marsala or how every you spell it were dull and taste like it was made from prego or ragu brand sauce, the only reason I give this 3 stars is that there was no wait, fast service and great proportions of food for the price, but if your not a big group of people I would recommend going 2 miles down to bootleggers Italian bistro, that's quality Italian"}
{"text":"The hosts here are terrible. When we fame in they were rude and belligerent. They gave us attitude when we asked them to store out cake in the freezer and escorted is to our table in a rude manner. Their attitude reflects on the entire restaurant and we are not pleased."}
{"text":"Made family reservations for Christmas dinner. We specifically requested the Pope room since we had been there right after thanksgiving. Reservations were confirmed after lots of run around from the staff. We had originally spoke with Hailey who never returned numerous calls! We arrived on Christmas Eve to the restaurant when we were told the pope room was already reserved for someone else since July! Hailey said that was impossible since they weren't taking reservations at that time! It was obvious Hailey \"manager\" and staff don't communicate! To add more to the miscommunication, it wasn't going to be a traditional Christmas dinner like we were told before! None of us felt like eating pasta for Christmas. Especially in a room we didn't want! Luckily we were able to get accommodations next door at The Texas Road House! The steak dinners, staff, service, and atmosphere saved Christmas dinner for us! Buca made us feel unwelcome and unimportant! We'll never revisit or recommend! The Texas Roadhouse will be earning lots of our future business! We'll especially be asking for Allie! She provided our family wonderful service! Thank you Texas Road House! Good riddance Buca di beppo!"}
{"text":"Great food! We just didn't know the amount we were getting well we didn't care. More  food than one person can eat unless they are starving for days! Great place to eat while in Vegas! Will return if I ever go back!"}
{"text":"If I was a giant, and hungry, Buca would be my first stop in Las Vegas. The portions of Italian food at this restaurant teeter totter on the line of ridiculous. The dishes are meant for sharing, but seriously, a family of twelve couldn't even dent the spaghetti bowls. My friend Jackie had her cosmetology school graduation party here, and as a party of thirty, we definitely only needed to order about ten dishes. The food is tasty and all of the dishes are recognizable. The walls are lined with all sorts of trinkets and doodads to look at while you wait (even with a reservation, please believe you will wait at least thirty minutes) and has a real old school Vegas/Italian mobster feel. Never go on a weekend evening, it is too much to handle (think back to the party of forty) and the service is backed up to the point of turtle slow. But if you can get in on a weeknight, I suggest bringing an empty stomach!

Recommended entre: I'm a meatball girl, so I always go with meatballs and spaghetti

Recommended company: Your entire girl scout troop, or at least a group of four."}
{"text":"Okay...so I don't really get why it's so crowed all the time??? The food isn't anything to go crazy over. Expensive, mediocre food? No.
Okay, before I start to say the bad stuff, I'll start with the good stuff. The walls are adorned with funny pictures. They give you a nice little homey feeling. The pizza was pretty good too. Saucy, but that's no big deal. The house bread is pretty good too. I am a bread lover, and this was up to my standards. But, the spaghetti and meatballs weren't good. The sauce was weird tasting. I don't know how to describe it, it just made me crinkle my nose. The meatball didn't taste good at all. It seemed too soft for a meatball. I also had the chicken. It was VERY lemony. If you like a very strong, sour lemon taste, sure. Order it. But if you don't, do not order. Warning: COULD cause cheeks to disappear into mouth. 
I sound like a little jerk, but hey. I didn't like it."}
{"text":"We had not been to Buca Dr Bello in a long time, but tonight we celebrated my birthday. We had a reservation and we're seated timely. Jarrett was our server and he was great....food  always more than enough...thanks for making it special"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner last night with great service by Jarrett, our waiter. He described so many dishes and referred some options that ended up being great.
Thanks Jarrett."}
{"text":"Had I written this review yesterday because I was hungry, craving pasta and eating here pretty late at 9 pm, it would have gotten one more star for coming to my rescue while driving around looking for food.  24 hours later , with a clearer mind, i can say this place is average. The bread very plain, the shrimp linguine quite bland. The service and decor are quite good though. And finally, so Not the place to go for a meal for one.The size of helpings is HUGE. I had enough left over for lunch. Which would have been a good thing had the food been tasty."}
{"text":"Please, for the love of all that is holy and good in the world do not step foot in this restaurant. Wait, \"restaurant\" is a misnomer.  A better description is \"dirty tourist trap\"

Where should I begin? Let's talk about the decorations. They suck. The place looks like the home of an acid-tripping mobster diagnosed with pathological hoarding.  It also smells like a Chuck e. Cheese ball pit.

What next? Let's talk about the service. The waiter looked like she had just butchered a cow when she took our order. And no, this is not a cool organic farm to table thing, she literally was covered in bits of meat and pasta sauce. Her tie kept dragging in our food too. 

Now, the food. There are a couple of reviews the point out the portions are large. I agree that they are large, but would suggest that they are large in the sense that a pig eats a large amount of food at a pig trough. And the food actually doesn't taste much better than pig slop. Actually, this is offensive to pigs.  I assume pig slop is reasonably priced, this is actually not.  The \"large\" portions are just because they fill the plates with cheap, bland, pasta.

Finally, I saw in other negative reviews that the manager kindly reached out to the reviewer and offered to fix grievances. I sincerely hope the manager does not try to contact me.  You could not pay me to go back there. The only way to fix our grievances would be to burn the place down to the ground."}
{"text":"Very good, ok portions, but very pricey. It's nice to go to for a special occasion..... also don't like having to pay a decent amount to park where it's located."}
{"text":"We made a reservation online.  Arrived and we were seated right away.  That's where the good service ended.  The service was very poor and super slow.  My husband ordered a glass of wine when the waiter finally arrived to take our drink order.  His took 15 minutes to arrive and when they did bring his I decided to get one also.  It took 30 minutes for my glass of wine to arrive!  55 minutes for food.  Were never asked if we wanted a refill and had to flag down the waiter for more water.  No one ever came back to ask if everything was ok, how was the food, did we need anything.  Food was decent, not spectacular but it took almost 90 minutes for two people to have dinner.  Although the food was ok the whole experience was pretty poor.  Not sure if we will ever go back."}
{"text":"This is a follow up to my May 9 2015 review of my visit to Buca Di Beppo at Arrowhead. 
Quick recap; the food was sub par, the waitress brought our bottle of wine which was already corked. And to add insult to an already BAD experience, the tiramisu was dry and had no taste. The waitress and mgr tried to convince us the tiramisu was dry because it was fresh and no time to settle. Really? This was for my birthday back in March. We dropped about $200 for dinner that night. 
I received an email and later spoke in person to Emily Bishop representing the restaurant out if San Diego. She was concerned and offered to send me a gift card asking us to give them another chance. She intended on visiting the restaurant and making sure things were being done right. It was a nice conversation and agreed on many aspects. I had been a long time patron at their restaurant in Seattle for many years. I told her to hold off on sending me any compensation for dinner till she visited and corrected matters. It served no purpose for me to risk having another bad       
Experience for the sake of a free meal,and    she understood. 
Five months later... Nothing. 
Maybe it was as good as it was ever going to be. Too bad. Too many quality family Italian restaurants for me to patronize. Growing up on Italian food in Brooklyn I know my food and I know what I'm talking about! 
Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at this location. Las Vegas needs to get it together. We made a reservation online 4 hours before and when we got to the restaurant the hostess said \"we will have you seated in a few moments\". After waiting 30 minutes the manager then said that he wasn't accepting the online reservations for this day. Well then why is it on the website that the reservation is available? (Mind you, we are on a time limit because we have somewhere to be that is why we made a reservation) The 6 of us were seated in a cramped booth that was meant for 4 people. Luckily we got an amazing server that I thought would save our experience but then halfway into our dinner we had a group of 18 girls sat by us and the room got extremely loud. At that point I couldn't even hear my family members speaking to me. I'm extremely disappointed with this locations restaurant. Me and my family members always go to the location in redondo beach, ca that is MUCH better."}
{"text":"Recently went for family dinner and was not impressed, seated us all the way in the back for a fairly empty restaurant, smelled like wet carpets and grandmas basement. Took 15 minutes to be checked on for refills. Refills themselves took a long time. Chicken parm was very dry, penne vodka was bombed with pepper, if you're looking for good Italian food, pass on this place."}
{"text":"Organized a family reunion over Thanksgiving.  Service and food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Definitely great quality! I had a less than perfect meal. The manager immediately contacted me wanting to demonstrate that there had been a series of mistakes and the level of the restaurant is much higher than what I had experienced. We talked on the phone and all was corrected.  
No restaurant is perfect but the management here definitely goes out of their way to ensure high quality food and definitely takes satisfaction seriously. 
I was definitely satisfied with with my meal!
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is crazy cool and the food is good. The dishes are large and leave plenty to eat the next day. Have made this our regular weekly place to eat. Staff is friendly and service is good."}
{"text":"I was recently here for lunch with a Party of 6, and was very disappointed with the manager and waiter ! I ordered a sangria  and had left muy passaport in the hotel safe ( I'm 35 and look like 40) and I was asked for an id I showed him muy Intl drivers Lic. But he could not find my age, so he asked his mánager if he could allow me to purchase the drink but. Was denied!! Thanks you guys Made my day! 
P.S. the bread was cold!"}
{"text":"I liked this place portions were big enough for 2 people. The service was good, we didn't have to wait to order or anything. And of course quality of food was up too par. We had mozzarella tomato appetizer and seafood pasta delicious."}
{"text":"Upon walking into the classic Italian chain restaurant (with a huge group I might add,) I was pleasantly surprised by the tastiness of the food. We started off with a salad with apples, walnuts, and a wonderful dressing with gorgonzola cheese. Then, for the main course we ordered the chicken limone and pasta diablo. Both were very tasty and much better than anticipated. I love the family-style serving and the building itself was huge. The atmosphere was perfect for a group or family outing."}
{"text":"For the price, quality, serving size, and service, this place is hands-down my favorite. I come here every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"This Bucca di Beppo had amazing service! The staff was friendly and even on a busy day, I feel we were seated and served in a timely matter. The food was delicious!! I loved it! We Will definitely go back, and we will be bringing friends!!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times in the last 6 months and wont go there again! Last time was a few days ago and went with my girlfriend and its like i was at peter piper with kids yelling and at the bar which i think thats not legal,but the main issues are high prices for not really great food and now, the worst thing is the cheap walmart bread they give you with your meal, for prices you pay, come on!, the bread can be a lot better!!"}
{"text":"Not even finished eating and I remember why I don't like it here.... Worst garlic bread ever!!!! Caesar's salad tastes cheep... Added chicken and it was not enough on the large salad! Disappointed!!! Waiting on the pasta.... But, not holding my breath!!!!"}
{"text":"Jarrett was just absolutely wonderful!!! We were celebrating a birthday and he was really really great with our rowdy crowd!!"}
{"text":"Just got home from my first visit to BDB.  Look, I grew up in very humble circumstances but this is the Wal Mart of restaurants.  It probably seems wonderful to some folks due to the huge portions but for those with any kind of palate it is really, really, sub-par.

There were 20 of us for a party so therefore there were a variety of plates and I had the opportunity to try several of their entrees.   I just couldn't eat the stuff it was so bad.

Olive Garden is a step up....

Don't do it!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a special occasion that we were celebrating with the whole family.  It was easy to make the reservation- this place is the BEST if you have a large group.  The service was great, tons of delicious food, which is perfect for sharing family-style.  We had a wonderful dinner celebration.  Very pleased with the experience and will be back either with just my husband or the whole family!"}
{"text":"We ordered garlic bread and some frutti di mare pasta. It took very long before the pasta was served, about 30 minutes wait. But then our server apologized and take it off our bill. The service is nice, but the food is just okay."}
{"text":"Excellent food brought the family and it was great even with a picky eater! It's family style service and the portions were just right. I think the biggest thing was the quality of food for the price. Walked out spending $75 for a great family dinner on the strip! 

The wait was only 15 minutes so wasn't too bad. All in all it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Expensive, mediocre food makes one wonder how this place stays in business.  There are tons of outstanding Italian restaurants in this town and many more reasonable.  They charged us almost $10 for a Caesar salad that was basically lettuce with a couple of croutons.  Downhill from there.  Are those shills who give this place high ratings."}
{"text":"A group of us dined here recently. The place was disgusting dirty. Pure filth. We were taken to third floor in the elevator. The smell was so bad and the carpet black with filth. We took he stairs down. The hand rails were sticky with grime.   The salad was good and fresh. The pizza was just warm as if it had not been in the oven very long or surely not long enough. I could excuse the food but never the sanitation which also reflects in the overall quality and poor management"}
{"text":"After having dined at Bucca di Beppo several times we have always found the food great. Tonight we had made reservations for 6 well in advance. When we arrived there were a few large groups (teams in for a tournament) but not full by any means. Our waiter came right away, introduced himself and presented as if he was on the ball and ready to serve. That was about the extent of good service for the evening. He would come and then leave for long periods of time, never checked how things were either. As the evening went on his periods of being gone became longer and longer and we had to go to get another server to come and help us. The food was good as always, the menu has changed a little since we were there last and the prices are still great for the amount of food you get. It really is too bad that the server was so slow that he spoiled the evening for us. Not sure if we will go back anytime soon to this location as there are a lot of other very good restaurants in Old Scottsdale that have equally as good of food and have exceptional service too."}
{"text":"The food is possibly good.. Because it smells great. It took an hour to get our food. We couldn't eat. There were maybe two other tables there at the same time. They didn't offer any comps ... We were so upset and rushed to get back to work that we didn't say anything about it. Horrible service. They didn't bring any bread during the wait. I'm leaving a restaurant that I sat in for an hour, HANGRY.

Jack in the box would have been more satisfying."}
{"text":"I've come to this Buca several times and it seems like a hit or miss sometimes. I'm not sure if it's better to go in big groups or just on date night but the last time I came with my g/f and some friends, the food was okay. I didn't think it was worth the price but oh well. But my experience prior to that which was several months ago, it was great. Everything we got seemed to fit the bill and was delicious. 

I always love the Garlic Bread here and the Caprese. Great starters. 

The atmosphere is nice and definitely feels like family place which I like.  
I wish I can maybe give 3 1/2 stars just because of the past experiences that were good and some okay and some that were..eh...it's alright.

Also, what happened to the Angelo pizza? Had it once and i thought it was pretty good. Haven't seen it in several years now. :("}
{"text":"Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food. 

I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked. 

I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it! 

So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it. 

So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.

I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke! 

FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.

No value means lost customers ...."}
{"text":"It's been two years since I've been to Bocca De Peppa.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and thought the food was very descent the service was good and the atmosphere was interesting. This time the food itself was average-at-best we ordered the garlic bread it was dry as dust, the bruschetta was served in such a way it was not easy to serve your self it was just put together poorly, and the flavor just wasn't there the bruschetta chicken was very good and the meatball and spaghetti very good. We had treated neighbors who had not been there before and I was embarassed that the food was unappealing as it was this is very unfortunate I won't be going back"}
{"text":"We love it here! Our bartender, Cindy, is attentive and fast. Great food. We usually order the prosciutto stuffed chicken with extra pesto. Its delicious! Its breaded tender chicken with marinara and pesto sauce. Amazing. We also tried the brussels sprouts and prosciutto. One word, DELICIOUS. Its kind of like brussles sprout chips! The iced tea is also amazing!! Would definitely recommend Buca to anyone who loves Italian food!"}
{"text":"$18 pizza, that looked like it was meant as an appetizer pizza.  It had 9 palm size slices.  Took a picture with a pen to show how ridiculous.  I'll try to post.  It didn't taste bad, but it also wasn't anything different or interesting."}
{"text":"Great Food Great ambiance Great Service Family Style. Make sure that you reserve the kitchen table if you can.we were pampered by Haley and Austin. we would recommend the trio platter to start and keep going from there. Just Fantastic what a Treat!"}

Presuitto, don't get spinach cheese bread
Tasted like cheese substitute,fantastic
Atmosphere and waitstaff"}
{"text":"Vast amounts of poorly prepared food presented in a raucous atmosphere of dragooned waiter/waitress choruses of the \"special\" restaurant birthday song.

If you don't have a screaming infant you need to bring to a restaurant, don't go.  

The Veal Parmesan was a howling mess.  It's an \"Italian\" restaurant, and they don't even serve capellini."}
{"text":"edit
biggest scam in town.  they serve spaghetti without enough sauce on it to be palatable and then when you complain, charge you for more sauce. when you order coffee, look out! they charge you for each refill. when my bill came it had $9.00 on it for a coffee and two refills. i said there was no way in the world i was paying $9 for coffee, so they took it off. i'm sure they are scamming everyone else in the same way. the waitress said these extra charges were \"company policy\". the food was barely mediocre, the service terrible and the inside \"decor\" is awful."}
{"text":"Today's experience was just awful, plain and simple. I don't even know where to begin, but here goes. 

Came here with my hubby for a late lunch before he needed to go back to work.  He ordered the lunch chicken parm and our server said it comes with a side of pasta and you pick another side. My hubby and I both looked at each other like what? Because we had just been in the week before and it came with one side, the pasta being a choice. We asked the waitress if she was sure and she said yes. So he ordered the potatoes, thinking he was getting chicken parm, side of spaghetti marinara AND also potatoes. But when his plate comes out, it's just the chicken parm and potatoes. We asked where the pasta was and she said that's the side you ordered. So a crazy weird mix up there. 

Then I had ordered the dinner size small spaghetti marinara knowing there would be leftovers to take home. But when the waitress read back my order she said the large spaghetti marinara. I had to correct her that I wanted the small dinner size.  When this came out, the bowl was fairly small, not the usual size it supposed to be, and then to top it off, the marinara was runny and non-existent, not the thick marinara that it usually is and there was plenty of liquid at the bottom. Just gross.. I asked the waitress why the size is smaller than usual, and she says that's the size it is. I disagreed on that. But she was long gone, going to get the missing side of pasta for my husband. 

So since the waitress hadn't come back yet I went looking for the manager as we were on a time schedule and that time was running out. I found our waitress behind the bar area and when I asked for the manager, she pointed to a lady at the other end of the bar from where we were. I know the manager heard me ask about a manager but did not make a move toward me.. So I had to walk over and ask if she was the manager, she said yes, and I proceeded to tell her that we needed to leave, the food was all messed up and we did not have time for them to fix it as we needed to go. She did come to the table and saw about the spaghetti and did agree about the marinara being runny and she did agree that the size was wrong and that it should be larger. By this time the waitress had come back with my husband's side of spaghetti marinara. His marinara looked better than mine in that it was thicker on top but it still had liquid on the bottom. Makes you wonder if the cooks understand that you need to STRAIN the pasta before you pour the sauce on top SMH. The manager did see this and agreed that the liquid needed to be strained off his pasta, so she took it to the kitchen. 

Right about this time is when my husband tells me his chicken parm tastes awful, very hard and unplatable. When the manager brought back the side pasta we told her about the chicken and said we just needed to go. We don't want anything, it's all just a mess. She did give us the side of pasta to take.
We just left shaking our heads thinking what in the world just happened here? 

Our last visit the week before was perfect. We came about 9 pm and sat in the bar area and our waitress was so attentive and friendly, service was perfect and the food was yummy (we ordered the exact same thing as today). That's the reason we were craving it again. This time was a disaster and it makes me wonder if we can ever come back. Sad because we love the food. :("}
{"text":"do not get the veal marsala, way too sweet. one of the servers was way rude, and the management leaves a lot to be desired. They are not nearly as \"family friendly\" as it seems. Very disappointed with staff & treatment - my family will NOT be going back



Update: management did contact me...stated would look into treatment & gave coupon to try again. Haven't been back, yet"}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve 1 star worst experience at a restaurant I ever had. JOE the server was horrible in every way can't even start to list the negatives but wait there's more CODY The so-called manager had no  people skills he should not be working in food services or even customer service, he didn't even care to listen to our comments about are serves, Buca do Beppo get a real manager and get rid of this joker two guys with the worst attitude working the same place wow I guess it's Vegas anything can happen!!"}
{"text":"First off I used to enjoy coming here but me and my wife came in and was seated in drank to glasses of tea before the bartender took our order. Our waitress Kaitlyn walked past is four times.  I guess since we didn't drink she didn't want to serve us when the waiters came to fill our glasses they were somewhat detached our appetizers went to another table while we were the only ones sitting in the area without any food.  This is a nice place to come to eat but the staff sucks.. Definitely won't be coming back here again u guys SUCK also was mad that we used a birthday coupon JEEZ."}
{"text":"Good food. Warned by menu abd staff, share. Our waiter was excellent. One of the best ever. Courteous, prompt, attentive.

Fault of give shared two entrees abd a salad. Warm tomato abd spinach. Creating had a bit of sliced, delicious. Abd even though huge, Werth Nader it through the cheese ravioli. Miss than with the last minute. trip"}
{"text":"We had dinner with a large party and the manager was well aware days prior to our arrival. There was between 50-60 in our group and they provided us with 2 servers, both of which were slow and either didn't listen or completely forgot about requests that were made. A lot of the kids sat together and the servers completely ignored them. They were not asked what they wanted to drink until a parent insisted that the server get drinks for them. One of the parents spoke with the manager about needing more servers but he basically said that this is all we get. Again this was not a surprise, they knew we were coming and we all pre-paid for our meal so I guess the manager didn't care. 
The food was ok at best absolutely not worth what we paid for."}
{"text":"We had a serious issue with reservations on Christmas Day.  We are willing to give them another chance but I would be VERY hesitant to plan on going there for a major holiday."}
{"text":"Apple Gorgonzola salad look good but get dressing on Side ours was super salty. Lasagna was ok, nothing special. Bread with oil and balsamic was good but bread was cold, bread keeps coming if you ask though. Portions of corse are large. Make reservation to avoid long waits."}
{"text":"Well  my friends this is one of the bad ones for me.  This use to be a family favorite for many years.  After doing a little shopping at the mall we would stop here to eat and gather our thoughts.  So here we go let me first say we have visited this restaurant on multiple  occasions and this is the worst time in the history for us. We were greeted upon entering but waited 4 minutes before being asked if we were dining in our picking up and order.  Why are we waiting to seated when no other family or patrons are waiting. Now off to our table the place was empty no more that 8 table in use. Yet we were cramped at a table and not a booth.  Humm now I am taking notes as this is not the kind of service I remember. So now I am ready to leave but the family wants to stay cause they enjoy eating. We order chicken alfredo and baked ziti and of course the short people requested ol favorite mac n cheese. Well long story short the waitress was the best thing at this restaurant.  My children's food had to be returned as it was cold as ice in the middle. My chicken alfredo was soupy/liquid sauce (you gotta be kidding me) must be a practice run on my order.  My husband baked ziti was drowning in marainera sauce which is a no no for those of us that know real Italian food. So to avoid being a meanie I will end this review like this.  The waitress was pleasant so I tipped her service but after being billed 100+ for food we didn't bother to take with us.  We will not be returning for any reason I could have feed my family twice and McCalisters for the cost of this on the run dinner.  No I would not advise anyone to visit but if you are up to the challenge go for it."}
{"text":"Nice standard Buca food.  It can get pricey, but the quality is never in doubt.  We stopped in for dinner and we were not disappointed.  The food and the service were great.  No complaints what so ever.  This is always a good place for the family to stop in and have dinner. 

It is located inside of the Excaliber hotel, so it can be a little tricky to get to."}
{"text":"Came here for my dad's birthday tonight. Ok service, but the waiter took my dad's drink to refill and never gave it back, even after asking again. We usually get my dad's favorite dish that is now off the menu, but they make it for us anyway. Tonight, they didn't, which is understandable because it's not on the menu anymore, but they made some weird excuse about being out of ingredients that were never present in the dish. We chose the penne San Remo, which was flavorless and not that appetizing. We barely touched it. The noodles are supposed to be al dente, which I love, but were really undercooked. A lady who I'm assuming is the manager came over to ask how are meal was, and when we told her about the hard pasta, she told us that's how they do it so next time order it another way. Funny, because we have been here plenty of times before and it was never like that??? The family next to us complained about the noodles as well, but the manager didn't seem to care. Place has gone downhill, and it's sad, because we have been coming to this place since I was a little girl. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here, ordered a salad and chicken, the chicken came out slightly undercooked, we told Jonathan, our waiter, and he took it back. Then he and the manager came out to apologize.
They gave us a free meatball side dish while we waited, and then comped our meal! They went over and above what was expected. 
Great service, nice atmosphere, and good food. 
Give them a try."}
{"text":"Great food, family sized portions, not cheap but worth the price!
First time here and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ate here Saturday night, June 25, 2016 and was not impressed.  My wife, mother in-law and myself ordered stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer which were good.  Our entrees included macaroni rosa and shrimp florentine.  The macaroni was delicious, but nothing you couldn't make at home that was just as good!  My wife took one bite of the shrimp florentine and spit it out.  She said the shrimp were not fresh and the dish smelled very heavy on the seafood side!  When we brought this to the attention of our waitress she said, \"sorry, I love shrimp\".  When our bill arrived I had to ask for a manager who did come over and take off the $27 dish that everybody at our table thought was disgusting.  It was hassle free dealing with the manager, but the waitress should of taken care of this since everyone at the table were not satisfied with the dish.  Not sure I will be dining here again!"}
{"text":"I love my Italian food saucy and lot's of it. At Buca I get both and the Arrowhead location was no disappointment. I took my family on a Saturday night around 9pm. The restaurant was a little scarce and the hostess was a little \"uppity\". Other than that, the food, service, and time from ordering to receiving our dishes was great. We had the Cannelloni, Pizza, Calamari, and Buca Trio sampler. Everything tasted great and presented very well. 

I will be making another trip soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at BdB last night for the first and last time.  The reasons being first and foremost their prices are ridiculously high for what you get.  Secondly, the food was okay, but not what I would call spectacular.  I realize everyone's taste is different, hence the two stars and not one.  We've had far superior Italian food at The Olive Garden for less cost and the same level of service.  The two bright spots were the atmosphere (very colorful and interesting) and most of all, the service which was outstanding.  Since we'd never been here before, we wanted to check it out.  Our curiosity being satisfied, we can now safely say \"Arrivederci!\" to Buca di Beppo!"}
{"text":"While wait for a table there was no bar tender. Once seated no one came to get our drink order they only came to get our food order. We ordered 4 waters and 3 ice teas and still did not get the drink order right! Definitely sub par service here."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment how the management do not appear to be on the same page.  My husband and I came for lunch around 2pm. The waitress was super helpful and gave us military discount after my husband showed her the ID.

Two nights later, we brought our friends here for dinner before The Blue Man Group show, the food was slow coming out, the spaghetti sauce looked and tasted burnt then when my husband placed his military ID in the pouch along with his credit card for payment, the waiter asked, \"what's this for?\"  We explained, we have received discount two days ago when showing the ID so we were providing the proof. The waiter said, \"oh, I have never seen it but I'll check with my manager.\" Less than two minutes later, he came back and said no discount can be offered.  REALLY?!  Well, the waiter glared at us and YES, Buca di Beppo, you have lost our business from here on out! No, it's not the discount we missed out. It was the inconsistencies plus the ignorant waiter you hired who was disrespectful to an ex service member!"}
{"text":"I wanted to do something different for Thanksgiving so we tried Buca. We got it to go and were anxiously awaiting a delicious Italian meal at home. We ordered the Veal Marsala, it was bland and the veal was overcooked. Next on the menu was the Sorrento Salmon it wasn't bad the Salmon was also a little overcooked. The spaghetti and meatballs bleh worst marinara sauce I've had in a long time. The rosemary potatoes tasted sweet and very very dry. 

I am so disappointed that I was the one that suggested we try this place out for a non traditional Thanksgiving meal. We wil never ever eat here again. Terrible food."}
{"text":"We ordered Baked Ragatoni. OMG this meal was fantastic. We ordered a large for just 2 of us. Needless to say, the homeless around the hotel will eat well.  Great wait staff, sat us very quickly (7:40pm) and the food was out in less than 15 min of ordering. The restaurant had about 50 people in it so that's saying something about their promptness."}
{"text":"Third time here and still a huge fan. Would be 5 stars but the sangria was awful, watered down and just plain blah. The Calamari was under cooked as well. Server again was Rhys and he as always was very helpful."}
{"text":"After experiencing Buca's in California, we were excited to see one here!  The atmosphere was wonderful, as was the food.  Huge portions never disappoint for lunch the next day.  

The welcoming staff was wonderful to hold the door open for us.  We were given the \"tour\" through the kitchen enroute our table.  Our waiter was a bit overwhelmed as he was solo in our area.  We were the only table at 4, but 3 other tables filled soon thereafter.  He served us well and didn't miss anything; even keeping our glasses full...albeit a bit slow.

The only reason for 4 stars was the lack of wait staff.  We'll go again!"}
{"text":"Prior customer with fairly good memories (3-4 out of 5), but last night's visit was beyond bad. Terrible service, OK food, and pathetic presentation. Not sure if we want to come back ..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit with Jarrett so much and he really gave my kids and I an amazing, personal experience! It was much needed"}
{"text":"Decent prices for great food. Not a quiet evening out but a lot of fun because of the kooky atmosphere. Without preconceived ideas, you can have a truly fabulous time."}
{"text":"Terrible catering experience. The driver was lost  for over 30 min. The food arrived cold and dried out. I was embarrassed to serve it to my guests."}
{"text":"Where do I start, I decided to treat my beautiful wife to an early mothers day dinner. Bucca de Beppo, the restaurant where time seems to slip through the cracks of your fingers. There is one gentlemen that works his heart out and I notice it. Jarrett, no man makes me laugh or smile that easy. I hope your manager is reading this and takes time to thank you for making his life easier. You deserve every smile that catches your eye. Thank you and everyone looking to visit, request Jarrett. Your welcome fellow consumers."}
{"text":"Another amazing visit here! It has officially become our go to celebratory place.  Food is so incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"We were very hungry after our off-roading adventure ( Las Vegas Rock Crawlers) and we got dropped off at the Excalibur, so we decided to eat inside. We got seated immediately since there were only 2 other filled tables. Then we waited. 

The good: tasty garlic bread
The okay: Chicken Limone - my son said it was \"good\"
The bad: 45 min wait time for food in a practically empty restaurant, garlic bread served with entrees even though I requested it as an app, penne rosa was bland and gummy, chicken parm was bland and underwhelming.

We would not return."}
{"text":"I do not understand how a plate of pasta and a glass of wine can turn into a $60 bill. Quality of the dish is more in line with a $5 plate fom a food court."}
{"text":"We had a terrific dinner and service. The waitress was attentive. The food was delish!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, my wife and I had the bruschetta(tomatoes, onion, basil) real basic but good. We shared the manicotti. Family style for 2 was 4 pieces. Layered on top marinara sauce then covered with alfredo. With two 14oz beers, and a peach Bellini(champagne cocktail. It was under 60 dollars. Are server was Melanie she was very good and helpful and knowledgable . Overall good experience and we will return!!"}
{"text":"I don't see what everyone raves about. I didn't care for the family style and I can make better spaghetti at home for half the price. Won't be returning and I don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Poor food and service.  This was my first and last time. We had the watery shrimp linguine, italian cobb salad that had so little meat and olives that we had to request the server bring some.  The italian cake and garlic bread are okay.  This is a family style only place so there are big tables in every room for large noisy party goers. The servers must pay attention only to the big tables as we had to have someone find them when needed. Entrees are more than $20 each as they are to feed 2 or more.  You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the table...one look aound should have been our clue to leave."}
{"text":"Awesome food n plenty of it. Bring your appetite. Jarrett was our waiter n a very good waiter at that. Thank you Jarrett for your hospitality and professional outgoing service."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this place because the food is just okay and the service is horrible.  I planned a Thanks Giving dinner here for my Mom and I.  She is in town from Boston and I wanted her to have a no worries dinner with no clean up.  I made reservations for 6:45 pm a week in advance.  I called the day before  and confirmed my reservations and asked should I order my food in advance and the lady told me that would not be necessary.  I said thanks and looked forward to a nice turkey feast for two with Mom.  We went shopping at the mall and worked up a good appetite for our feast.  When I arrived we were seated and the first thing the waitress said was they were out of turkey and pumpkin pie. I said excuse me, I have reservations and I was told yesterday I did not need to order in advance.  She said she was sorry but all day people were ordering turkey and they did not plan for so many people to order turkey.  I said really on Thanks Giving you did not think people who made reservations would order turkey!  Really!  Now I am starting to get frustrated because of the weak excuse for  ruining my 2016 Thanks Giving dinner.  Long story short, one of the mangers came out and said they had turkey but no pie and the waitress misunderstood what he told her.  I say \"BS\" they tried to screw me and when I was upset they did not want a scene and coughed up my turkey.  As I left 90 minutes later I showed my Mom the kitchen and guess what there was a big platter of turkey on the counter.  Please steer clear of this horrible customer service and shady business.  By the way, there was no compensation for the confusion.  Need I say more??"}
{"text":"This is only the second time we have been to this location since they went corporate.
Not very impressive honestly.

Since they went corporate, the food portions have DEFINITELY gotten smaller, the large would feed ~3 normal people so it's still pretty decent x
Pasta was a bit rubbery but they actually put a decent amount of sauce now!

We got here around 9pm and our server started us off with one loaf of bread.
The bread is actually one of the main reasons we even come here!
We were told (after asking for a refill) that they were baking some in the oven and so we eagerly waited.
That was around 9:30pm

We asked for the check at 10:15pm 
And that's when our server realized he still had not gotten our bread refilled.

It's almost been an hour at this point, I'm pretty sure bread doesn't take that long to bake and it irritated me, but my husband calmed me down and told me that he was probably just busy and had forgotten.

But honestly?
It was not that busy at all. 
Most of the employees were already putting away tables and it seemed like everyone was already in a rush to go home even though they didn't close for another hour.

Our waiter came back and told us that they have just simply run out of bread! (this is after we asked him once again, mind you. He did not even have the decency to tell us as soon as he found out)

Well. I mean, it IS just bread. 
So it really would not have been a big deal at all if we were told in the beginning, but it's just infuriating to feel like you're paying good money to get barely decent service.

Like honestly?
I bet that there WAS bread that was baking, he forgot about us because we are a younger couple, by the time he realized MAYBE they did run out of bread (but there was definitely some left when we first asked)

OR since we had to ask for a third time after paying MAYBE he forgot once again and was too lazy/couldn't be bothered to go grab some???

My husband was feeling very good (we were celebrating our valentines early as we hate the crowds) and so he kept going on and on about leaving a good tip (he's extra generous when he's happy)
We left a 10% tip in the end because we understand that most of the money the servers make is through tips (we don't like to fck anyone over something petty, but we just felt so very offended as we were not even given BASIC customer service)

Also, I just have to say (because it just seems so ridiculous) they stop baking bread at 9:30pm???
When they close at 11pm???

That's very strange.

We only got 1 refill (we had to ask) for the ice tea during our hour long visit (so much ice, it was literally 3 sips, like???)

It took longer then 10min for the server to collect the payment.

We didn't even get a bag.
My husband carried the container in his hand and even as we walked out NOT ONE PERSON offered a bag.
(just seems like the thing to do as an employee dedicated to providing excellent customer service, no?)

EDIT:

Also, the way he talked to us at the end was beyond infuriating.

As we collected the check we had to ASK ONCE AGAIN what's happening with the bread (that god damn bread, man)

WHY could he not just say something like \"I'm so sorry, it seems we've run out of bread. So sorry for the inconvenience\"

Then we could have been like
Nah, it's cool. It's just bread (I literally feel like pulling my hair out)

He was just like \"oh yeah man. there's no bread, we ran out or something\"

And my husband is just confused and asked him why he told us they were baking some more if they weren't

He's just like \"yeah, I don't know man. I guess not.\" (what the actual hell???)

It was actually kind of insulting how he was talking to us. 
His tone of voice suggested that he was tired of us and just wanted us to go away.

Sorry. I tried to be nice when I wrote this last night but damn man.
It's kind of hard to write a nice review about someone who made your blood boil.

Honestly wish I didn't tip at all.

Oh. I might only have 2 check-ins here, but we have been coming semi-regularly to this location since 2012 (1-2x every other month) and I just have to say that the new woman manager (or whatever she is) is also rude as hell x

There was a situation that happened on our last visit and after a few calls to corporate, the manager apologized.
I'm sure she was forced to do so because she sure as hell wasn't very nice when she was \"apologizing\" to my mother-in-law.

I originally gave it a 3 star rating because this was our first date spot and I didn't want to sully that memory (this place used to be special to us) but wow. 
Sorry, but forget that. 
BEING THERE and getting that HORRID customer service is what really ruins that place of nostalgia.

Taking it down to 1 star because I sure as hell won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time here...Food was great, Jarrett's service was great also.... will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Buca since I was in high school. My friend was celebrating her birthday, and she got a coupon in the mail, so we decided to go for dinner. I wasn't expecting it to be more than what I would any chain restaurant, but the food was so much better than I remembered. Their dishes are served family style so they're as big as I remembered them to be. We got a huge bottle of the house red wine, linguine frutti di mare, veal and eggplant parm, and big side of linguini with garlic, basil, and olive oil. We also got a complimentary birthday cake thanks to the coupon. We also had enough leftovers for an entire meal the next day. 

Overall the 5 Star review is really for our server, Darian. He was friendly, helpful, and did a superb job taking care of us. The food gets about 4 Stars. I've read some of the other reviews, and if you're expecting authentic Italian food cooked by someone's Italian grandmother, this ain't the place.  With that said, the food is still pretty tasty, and it won't break your wallet."}
{"text":"We had classic meatballs and spaghetti with the Caesar salad.The meal was prepared beautifully and the server was very helpful."}
{"text":"I dont often give 5 stars but Buca deserves 6 if it were possible.  After my Mothers funeral we were taking the entire family to Bucas for a luncheon.   There were 33 of us and I knew that many would be a bit of a problem but that never happened.  Pat the head of catering was extremely helpful.  I expected to see platters come out and as they emptied they would be refilled, boy were we in for a surprise.  It seems like there was a platter for every 4-5 people and the platters kept on coming from  salads, fettucine alfredo to veal parmesan to chicken marsala to spaghetti and meatballs.  There was something for everyone including wonderful desserts.  What I did not realize was as the platters were taken away and replaced with new food someone was in the back boxing up what was on the platters all the way through desserts.  Every family that was there went home with 2 bags with at least 2 containers in each bag.  We all had plenty of food for the next day.  I have never seen so much food.  Pat and his staff went out of there way to make us feel comfortable and stuffed.  We will definitly be coming back.
Thanks for all of your hard work."}
{"text":"Worst Italian restaurant ever. Ordered the Shrimp Florentine and got soppy pasta and freezer burned shrimp. The garlic bread was Ok. If you're looking for quality Italian this is not the place. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Boca di Peppo is one of the great places to go for reunion, family gatherings and any get together. The servings are huge good for 2 to 4 people depending on how the appetite. We have been visiting this place and the staff are awesome too."}
{"text":"Service was great, guy was attentive and quick, food was kinda blah tho. I feel like I can cook better Italian food and I'm not even Italian. I like their family style idea, I love sharing food, I just felt like it wasn't that great, even if it was priced less, I still probably wouldn't have been impressed."}
{"text":"Good food, great service! I went here with some coworkers for a dinner meeting. The host put us at a somewhat secluded table in the back of the restaurant where we were able to have our meeting, without being distracted by other parties. Our server Josh was very helpful at recommending appetizers, main dishes and desserts since we weren't very familiar with the menu. We ended up getting spicy chicken rigatoni, shrimp florentine and pasta and meatballs. The meatballs were huge!! Our favorite was the spicy chicken rigatoni, though. I'll definitely be returning to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Cheap, low-quality food and bad service with high prices.
The food is just like what you get at Presto Pasta, but you're gonna pay 5 times more for it.  I ordered a small pizza & small caesar salad, came out to over 40 bucks.  The pizza was soggy & greasy, and the salad had the least effort I've ever seen put into one.
I go to pick up my order & get there just in time to see the bartender have a meltdown & shout at a waitress, then I get ignored for 5 minutes and he gives me a crappy attitude when I only tip him 4 bucks for just handing me food that was getting cold on the counter next to him.
Buca used to have a reputation as a great restaurant but it's apparently been bought out & squeezed by the new investors because the place is frankly horrible now."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions (well, I feel like the eggplant parmigiana has been shrinking) but always a good meal and it's fun looking around."}
{"text":"Fourth time I been here with the family, only once was the service decent. Every other time service was very slow and refills nonexistent.  The last time we ate there one of our appetizers never came and the other one was missing one of the toppins. We split the check but they wouldn't let us use 2 different $10 coupons, \"only one coupon per table\". Guess I'll go somewhere else  for catering."}
{"text":"This place is not a \"true\" Italian restaurant, but it is a true Italian-American restaurant. After you eat here, you feel very heavy and full. After eating a true Italian meal, you'd feel full but very satisfied. The food is served family style, so multiple portions come on one plate-so hopefully you and the rest of your friends like the same things. I don't like the decorations on the wall. Just pictures upon pictures of people and objects. It looks like a Spaghetti Warehouse. The waitress we had was very nice, but her shirt was really dirty, which somewhat concerned me. The food was much better the second time that I came here. There are coupons that you can sign up for, and I suggest that you do. The food items are not cheap."}
{"text":"Took my best friend here for her birthday and we have been sitting here now for 45 minutes filling up on bread and soda. Worst choice ever"}
{"text":"One of the worst meals we have had in quite a long time!!  Very over priced for mediocre food!  Started out bad...::we noticed we had no silverware after the salad was served.  Had to flag down our server to get it. She threw 2 settings on the table and left ( there were 5 of us). 5 min later brought 3 more sets. She said she would bring bread with dipping oil.  Got the bread, no oil, no butter.  Flagged down a server, asked for for the oil....got it with Parmesan cheese that looked like powder.  Asked for butter, got three pats!  The Apple Walnut Salad looked fantastic but had little to no dressing.  Couldn't find a server to ask for more.  We ordered Chicken Lemone and Veal Parm.  The portion sizes of both were small and we had to send it back because it was tough and served cold.  Hardly ever saw our server.  We flagged down anyone we could to get what we needed.  When we tried to pay the bill and leave it took forever to get our check.  We were there over 2 hours and the meal was terrible.  For what it cost us we could have had a great meal in a 5 star restaurant!  Will never, ever go back!"}

{"text":"Just OK food.  Inattentive waiter, way too expensive for food quality and ambiance.  It's in a food court by a yogurt and a cinnabon.  No bathroom for patrons in the restaurant.  Gotta go to the food court bathroom.  Cheap paper napkins with the $38 spaghetti and meatball."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!
Really good minestrone soup!
Sat at the bar and had a complimentary post card of us.
Really happy to find this place"}
{"text":"I gave Buca di Beppo a second chance in the Excalibur hotel in Vegas. I first ate at this restaurant in NYC and had a bad experience but the one in Vegas was delicious. We had lunch at this location because they offered lunch specials. I ordered a chicken and penne pasta dish with white wine cream sauce and it was delicious. The serving was huge, I could only finish about half of the serving. I also had a coffee and it was so good! They provided us with great service."}
{"text":"Friendly, Fine, Food simple great Italian dishes."}
{"text":"This place isn't my cup of tea at all I hate chain restaurants.  But it's been going on 6 days in Vegas & I'm tired and wanna stay @ the south end of the strip.  

Our server was really nice & told us to avoid the $20 pitcher of margaritas and get the glasses they're a better deal.  Their drinks here are great.  We got a hot appetizer (prosciutto stuffed mushrooms). and it was good too.  Good food & 4 nice cocktails for $40 u can't beat it.  The service was incredible!"}
{"text":"Went earlier this evening with 2 people who have never been. Giving a 2/5 because the food was good, when we eventually got it. Otherwise, poor service!

We sat down at 4, the bartender took our drink order and while my friend was ordering an appetizer, the bartender walked off. Strike 1. 

When she came back a couple of minutes later, we placed our order, and we received the bread at about 415. We then received our garlic bread order at 430. At 445, the bartender came over, told us that the kitchen had been taking longer than usual (we were one of only 2 groups of people on that side of the room except for 3 people at the bar, otherwise the whole place was pretty empty), and that our food would be ready in a few minutes, and she took my drink to refill it. At 5, we still had not received our dinner order, the bread on the table had gone cold, and I still had not received my refilled drink back yet. Strike 2. 

At 515, over an hour since we were seated, we finally received our food, and she asked us if we needed anything else. I told her she still had not brought my refilled drink back, and she gave me a blank look like I was retarded. I told her she took my drink earlier to refill it, and never brought it back. She then realized that I wasn't nuts, and brought me a new glass. I was upset (I didn't say anything to her) but it was obvious on my face and she told me she realized that she did forget to bring my drink back, so apologized for that. but it wasn't her fault that the kitchen staff got our food out slow. Strike 3. 

I like the Mesa location a lot, but this one definitely did not leave a good impression on my friends, and myself - will not be bringing them back to this one."}
{"text":"I  enjoyed the ambiance of Buca di Beppo at Universal City Walk in L.A. so I decided to book our Christmas Eve dinner at the more local to us Buca. The family had never been and I knew it would be fun. As you can imagine on Christmas Eve, they were running a little behind but not majorly. Our server was delightful. The food was good, nothing exciting, and the portions large, as they are known for family style dining. It is a great value and a lot of fun for large groups."}
{"text":"The waiter we had was okay. Had to ask for basic things like house bread, utensils, fresh plates. Food was good and consistent with other Bucca restaurants I've been to in California. Based on other reviews of this specific location, sounds like it's a crapshoot on what type of service you'll get depending on who the waiter is."}
{"text":"It is ok but not the best I had before maybe because I make my own.  For none Italian it might be great."}
{"text":"I dined at Buca di Beppo on November 24, 2012 at around 4:00pm. My server was Eric. Over all, he was great. However, we had an issue though with what we were served. I ordered a small Quattro al Forno to share with my friend. The menu said Chicken Cannelloni was included.  All of the dishes served were stuffed with cheese only, except the shells. When I questioned Eric, he said the complaint was common and that \"the chicken is ground very finely and sometimes you can't tell it's there.\" I thought that was an odd response.  Looking at the menu further, I saw that the Chicken Cannelloni has spinach as an ingredient and nothing we ate had any spinach in it. As we were mostly finished with the meal, I did not press the issue. I don't know whether the kitchen made a mistake or the server wasn't familiar with the menu, but I am not sure I would return to this location."}
{"text":"Everyone at Buca is very friendly.  Their lunch is nice sized portions (unlike their dinner portions which are only suitable for \"family style\" sharing).  My g/f and I ordered their Apple Gorgonzola Salad and their Vegetarian Pizza.  Both were \"just ok\".  The salad had too many competing flavors including overly cinnamon seasoned walnuts competing with the other fresh flavors.  Also, their Italian vinaigrette didn't quite seem to match the other ingredients.  The pizza had a limp crust.  The toppings were nice with broccoli, peppers and mushroom flavors standing out.  Overall, the experience was 'ok' but I won't be rushing to go back."}
{"text":"Went here on a first date! I love Italian so being a chef my expectations were high heard a lot about this place. It was busy but we only had to wait 5-6 minutes and were seated service was good and the food was also good we shared spaghetti and meatballs, garlic bread, it was delicious and for dessert we shared an ice cream sundae it was huge lol but very yummy! You were not rushed and it was a great evening! There was a big party in our section a group of nurses from the philippines a 50 year reunion they were having a blast and a little loud but it did not ruin our evening and they felt bad and kept apologizing as they left lol

 I would recommend"}
{"text":"Two-people portion is small. Mussels are not fresh. Calamari is over-fried. Veal tastes stale. Nothing good tonight."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The portions are huge, which isn't a bad thing.  There's only a few menu items I like though.  Could do without the kitchen tour every time I go in though.  We mostly only go when we have a coupon.  Service is good, no complaints there."}
{"text":"We love to come to this place for all of our birthday celebrations... we always share all of the ginormous platters that they bring out. We had an amazing server Jessica tonight.... she was great even through the crazy large parties in the restaurant tonight being that it is Mothers Day weekend and the beginning of graduation season. The only bad thing I can say is we had to wait a while for our drinks from the bar and one of our appetizers didn't come out, but like I said it was crazy with huge parties... our party was 15 people! Thanks for the great service!!"}
{"text":"We called and made a reservation but when we got there they said they remembered taking the reservation but they wouldn't seat us for another hour after our reservation time. The manager refused to talk to us."}
{"text":"Great service
Overpriced corporate menu, but not surprised.  If your looking for something predictable you won't be disappointed. Although good flavor, $30 for veal Marsala should be more than 3 small pieces"}
{"text":"I first went to Buca in Scottsdale back in the day (no seriously, it was like... 8 years ago) and was suitably impressed with both the raucous atmosphere (naked people in the bathroom! How very European!) and delicious food. The chunks of garlic on the garlic bread were sinful and almost everything else was fabulous although I do recall never caring much for their marsala. 

So it was with a not insignificant amount of dismay that I watched, over the years, as Buca's quality declined, its food became less interesting, its service nonexistent and the atmosphere was ultimately no longer able to make up for its shortcomings. Eventually, I stopped going altogether, and I wouldn't have been back except that a family member's birthday was up and she wanted to go. 

Imagine my surprise to discover that Buca has revamped its menu and its attitude and I very much enjoyed my most recent experience there! Everyone agreed that the calamari appetizer was amazing as was the sampler appetizer (especially the mushrooms) - we cleaned them both up. The entrees fared well also, generous portions of delicious food with uniformly intense flavor... the sole exception being the salmon which was ridiculously dry.

If you're like me and you've been avoiding Buca, you might want to give them another shot. We actually spoke to the manager about how pleased we were and he mentioned that they had indeed been bought out recently and the new owners had changed things up quite a bit."}
{"text":"Need a place to celebrate your birthday party? Buca Di Beppo is one of the most creative and fun restaurants I have EVER been to! I highly suggest, especially if you are a vegetarian like myself, the Baked Ravioli.  The small plate (which serves up to three people) is only $15.95. If you want to serve your huge family then it is about $10 more, but it serves double the amount of people! 

The delicious ravioli doesn't just taste like plain cheese stuffed in a pasta like most restaurants make it. I personally am not even the biggest fan of cheese, but this ravioli is heaven. There are four cheeses with fresh marinara sauce laid on top of the pasta. The theme os this restaurant is Italian, which is awesome. You walk in... and feel like you are an Italian! The music and decor of the place is so fun to experience. Really, I could enjoy so many great options off their menu, and especially when it is your birthday, the waiters and waitresses put on a little show and sing happy birthday to you very loudly! You become the center of attention in the restaurant, and get a free desert which is so yummy. This is definitely a place to go with a big group of people."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could!! Ordered a baked ziti and the noodles were so overcooked I could literally hear them crunching as I chewed it. And they charge $20 for this cereal (I can't even call it pasta) topped with 1/2 an ounce of sauce and a scoop of dry ricotta. What a disaster...will not be returning."}
{"text":"The Costco of Italian restaurants.

Terrible food and service.

Listen, I get Italian family style dining. In fact I am a fan of it, especially being from NY. But what you serve I wouldn't feed my dog.

Please leave. 

Thank you and good day."}
{"text":"I have been craving the lasagna at Buca. Also ordered the antipasti salad and garlic bread. The salad was served and was good. We were told 3 times that the bread was on its way. Then the lasagna was brought out. Still no garlic bread--the server said it was a mistake in the kitchen because they made the cheesy garlic bread. She offered to take the bread off the bill. Finally the bread was delivered when we were about halfway finished with the lasagna. The buttered bread was covered in an insane amount of big garlic chunks. Had to scrape most of it off. So disappointed in the whole experience, especially the service."}
{"text":"TThis place is alive. It's like having happy family over for dinner. My international friends had fun and loved it. The food was great. The waiter was very detailed attentive and fun. I hope my friends remember all. My own family love this place. It is a place where we feel joy."}
{"text":"Love this place
Had dinner, ordered spaghetti dinner for two small size
Wonderful sauce, meaty and tasty 
Had enough to take home for another night 
Service very good
Garlic cheese bread awesome
Cheesecake great
Gonna go again for sure"}
{"text":"Terrible!!!!   Shoved 7 of us into s 6 person booth in the kitchen and then we were shown every dish on the menu while our food took over 2 hours. Our waitress didn't even bother to show her face the manager had to wrap things up"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here the night we arrived in Vegas.  We were staying at the Excalibur so were looking for someplace close.  We didn't really have a good experience here.  The service was friendly.  No complaints there.  The free bread was okay.  Nothing special and really not much flavor.  The olive oil also seemed very bland and cheap.  This place is family style.  Each menu item has two choices for portion sizes - one that is to be shared by 2 people and another by like 4 or something.  The salad was definitely enough for 2+ people.  We got the Caeser salad.  It was really good.  For the meal, we settled on the Baked Ziti.  It was probably one of the worst baked zitis that I've had.  Very dry and bland.  Hardly any sauce or cheese.  Devoid of flavor.  Also, the portion was really good for 1 person.  My wife and I both agree on this.  Afterwards, we were both still hungry.  So, for the price, I don't think it was good.  For that price for Baked Ziti, I was expecting a large amount of pasta.  I've been served bigger portion sizes in the $10 range and this was like $20+ or something.  Maybe they were just having a bad night, but I wouldn't be in a rush to go back here again.  That's just me."}
{"text":"Yep, not impressed.  Couldn't get my family order to go online.  Called the restaurant directly and they took the order but weren't sure if any of my coupons would work. Came in to pick it up and they accidentally never submitted my order. Asked again about the coupon and they gave me less than what the coupon was.  Tried to get a glass of wine while I waited but 20 minutes for that.   Hmmm.  We'll hope the food is better than the service."}
{"text":"My sever was Jarrett he was super awesome and has served us many times I had a horrible day and he put a smile on my face!!! Food was delicious like always"}
{"text":"The fried calamari was pretty good. However, personally, I think the pastas were okay. We ordered Lasagna, Chicken Proscuitto, and Spicy shrimp pasta. I liked the Spicy Shrimp Pasta the most."}
{"text":"So, it's a super hot day today, but that did'nt stop me from craving eggplant parmesan. YUM! So me, and two other friends decided to order to go from their lunch menu. I used to eat buca regularly, so I have very high expectations for their food. When my food arrived, My eggplant parmesan tasted like charcoal. It was burnt to a crisp!!! Disappointment reigned as I tried to chew down my burnt, tough, eggplant. My friend ordered the speghetti and meatball, and the meatball was pink/red inside!!! My other friend ordered the chicken limone, which was supposed to come with fettuccini alfredo noodles. He a small piece of boiled chicken, a lemon, and pasta with no sauce. Hmmm.... we looked at his dish and analyzed it for a while, thinking this must have been a mistake. 
     So I called them, and they were very nice about. Although I do not agree with the justifications, I realize that accidents happen especially in the food industry. He said the meatball should be cooked because it sits in the sauce and has had at least 4 hours to cook. I dont know about that seeing as the meatball was pinkish red. Apparently he said that the chicken limone is supposed to be like that. In that case, it was  a HORRIBLE dish!!!! Boiled piece of dinky chicken with noodles and no sauce... for $10.00. They were nice enough to send us a coupon for free entrees to compensate, so I will try them once more, and retract my comment if they are good. Otherwise... stop being so cheap buca! keep your standards even though the economy sucks!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the services in other places, the one up in Seattle was pretty good but this service was tough to swallow.

We were seated in the bar area, which is nice because I was able to watch football but we waited a long time to order or even acknowledged. It took quite a few minutes to finally wave down the bar tender who was suprised that she had a table and nobody told her. She went into the walk in cooler when I asked for service. 

The food wasn't bad. Obvouisly it's all family style. It has a friendly atmosphere. We had a party of 3 so the amount of food we ordered was good. 

Parking lot is dark. And while in Sin City, best to walk to your car fast...why? Something about that security guard that walks between Mortons and Buca di Beppo is somewhat alarming."}
{"text":"We ordered our meal online for the family, and we picked it up, and the tab was $55+. Well folks, this has got to be one of the Sorriest excuse for food we have come across in a while! I could go into detail on every item, but I want bore you with all of that. We were Honestly shocked at how BAD this food was! Buca's sits atop of our short list of places not to revisit! Should have gone to Uncle Sal's.
PS
The dog wouldn't eat some of the items!"}
{"text":"We went to  Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant on our last stop before the airport. We all agreed on the spaghetti, and meat ball dinner. I enjoyed the meal, other than the noodles were a little more al dente  than I like. The complimentary bread was really good, and the Corona I had was super cold."}
{"text":"This is an update from September 10th, the owner or manager of this Bucca contacted me and gave an sincere apology for what happened, I explained to him what have happened and tried fixing it. So i decided to give Bucca another shot here in Fullerton, California. Here's what i liked and disliked.

Liked:
* The service was 10x more better here, with more customer interaction and little jokes here and there.
* The environment was a little more Family Oriented which I really like. 
* So much more friendlier staff that aren't looking like they hate their jobs. 
* Way better pasta, the one I got in Vegas was a bit bland. 
* The food proportion are HUGE, which i like, if I'm paying 22$ for a \"Small\" it better be good.

Disliked: 
* Everything came out really slow like, I was waiting a bit just to get a water refill.
* Some of these foods need a little more flavor, for example , I order the mozzarella garlic bread, it was good when i bit into it, but when i dipped it in my pasta sauce it was 100x more better, things like bread need a bit of sauce on the side to enhance the flavor.

Over all it was a hell of a lot better experience I had in Nevada, Hopefully this review helps and lets this business learn from its mistakes and strives to make this restaurant a better place for all if its customers, Remember Bucca \"Customer Is The Number 1 Priority!\""}
{"text":"Plates are sooooo big that a doggie bag is a must... Food is ok to good. But atmosphere and staff make it a solid 8"}
{"text":"The best Italian  restaurant  outside of Boston's North End. We came back after 5 years and it was just as good as the first time.  Price very reasonable as well.  Be sure to ask for jewel.  Well worth the trip from new Hampshire."}
{"text":"We had a large party and the service and food was great.  Our waiter, Jarrett was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service. Had  spicy chicken rigatoni and stuffed  chicken prosciutto. We sat upstairs in a section by ourselves. The service was good, but the restaurant was not busy. I have been to other locations in the past and they were very busy.  Don't know if that would have affected the service.  We had a great experience here."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Because I reviewed our recent experience at Buca Di Beppo in Peoria, AZ here on Yelp.... I was contacted (practically immediately) with a request for more information detailing our bad experience - which I supplied. They gave us a generous amount of gift cards for us to go back again them!! I live in a different city than where the event took place, but it is reassuring to know that there are people out there at the big chain restaurants that really, really do care about your unique experience. I plan to sent half of the gift cards to the others that were with us (that was their first experience dining there) so they can give it another shot! I only posted that bad review because I was so upset about the experience...just to vent... I NEVER expected to be contacted - let alone given an apology letter with gift cards to try again! Thank you Buca di Beppo!! I am still a fan!"}
{"text":"Originally left a bad reviw. Bur since then I was contacted by the district manager. You really seem to care about this restaurant's reputation. He said they're making improvements and that I should try it again. I told him I would and I will hold my review until I do that again. Everybody deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"Had the spaghetti and meatballs. Was mediocre at best. Almost no gravy. I expected better. Won't be returning. Better choices out there for Italian."}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed with Buca as I wanted to be. I'd always thought this place looked a little cheesy  from the outside, but after years of business, I finally decided to try it out with some friends who were celebrating a new job. 

Bread and drinks were promptly brought to the table, along with a side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. We decided to start with the mixed green salad, and added Gorgonzola and prosciutto on the side. Typically when I think of mixed greens, I think of mesclun, arugala, frissae, and other greens. Though I wouldn't expect these particular greens to be served in an Italian restaurant, I don't understand why they considered this salad \"mixed greens\". The only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage. I counted maybe five olives, and three pepperoncinis. The prosciutto and Gorgonzola were plentiful, though I'm not sure of the quality of prosciutto they use. It looked burnt and perhaps prepackaged like bacon bits. It was just okay as a whole. For our main dish, we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni. This is where the experience failed in my mind, as the chicken and peas did not taste fresh, and the sauce was lacking in depth and flavor. It just wasn't as authentic as I was hoping for. 

Service was fine, but I think I'll be skipping Buca next time I need a fix for Italian."}
{"text":"I love Italian food. It's one of my favorites! I've never gone here before, and I've heard that they have big portions and the food is really good. My friend and I were in the area the other day because we had a show to watch. She wanted pasta, and Olive Garden was too far. We went to Buca di Beppo, and the prices were expensive! It did say that the small portions would serve 2 or more people, so we shared a dish. We had chicken cannolini- a stuffed dish with chicken and cheese and spinach. 

They did come with bread and butter. Our bread was cold. It would have tasted much better if our bread was piping hot. Since I was starving, I stuffed myself with bread. When our stuffed pasta came out, there was only 4 pieces. I was kind of shocked because they said portions are large. I had 2 pieces and my friend had 2 as well. I was still hungry after eating. I don't eat much either. It was $24, which was definitely not worth it. Some of the other dishes might have bigger portions, but when you purchase meat, you get way less food? The pasta itself was delicious."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. The food is Ok but way overpriced. I always leave feeling ripped off when I leave this place (this was my second time, first time was in Texas). Our server was slow and inattentive. We waited forever to get the check, finally had to stand up and pretend to leave before she showed up. Never again for me here."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and we used to LOVE to spend lots of money.   Well, not anymore.   The management messed up our reservation, lied about it and then stuck us in a hole in the back of a room and it was literally 100 degrees.  We dont come here for the food, which is just mediocre, we come for the atmosphere, and as stated before, that was ruined by a messed up reservation. Had conversation with DVP and he explained what transpired and took full blame for botched reservation and how whole situation was handled."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We usually share a meal because they are so large. Food was good as always and our waitress was really at tentative."}
{"text":"I never thought I could find an italian restaurant that is worse than Olive Garden - well I just may have found it in Buca Di Beppo. About 15 of us showed up there on a Monday night and all across the table all I heard was that the food quality was terrible and the service was pathetic. Personally, the food that i had (spaghetti/marinara) tasted horrible. The bread was even worse than that. Don't plan on going to this place ever again."}
{"text":"My Father, Daughter and I went here for dinner tonight and I will say it was great. Everything made fresh there. You can actually taste the ingredients in the food! It was wonderful! My Father and I ended up ordering the Lasanga and my Daughter the traditional Fetticine. Both were excellent. Thought the portions at this place are ridiculous. A small dish will feed at least three people and the large, forget about it. The large will feed at least the whole family. We definitly brought food home! 
   The atmosphere in this place is wonderful too. They take you throught hte kitchen to get your table and you go through the kitchen again to leave.Definitly gives you the feeling like you just came home to have dinner. I loved it and will plan to return again soon."}
{"text":"Service Sucked and one of the heavy set waiters was very rude.
I had a party of 42 people and they were very slow with everything.  I had about 20 people covered and the rest were going to pay their own bill. I mentioned this to the waiter and after letting him know what tables should get a bill he went up to each table and loudly told them they were paying and he thought they should know. The way he did it was extremely rude and all the other guest heard him telling them and they felt bad just not the way to handle it.

The food was great, but the waiter was rude I only got 2 servers for such large party. I also had a cake and he forgot to bring it out. We spent a lot of money with them that day and I had guest who wanted more bread and drinks and they got them after we were done.

 People look for another place I read the reviews and did not pay attention I thought this cant happen to me! WEL IT DID. 
I will say that Erick was a great server but the other one sucked and he was not dressed proper, pants sagging and just looked bad. 

Will not come here again EVER."}
{"text":"Bland, Americanized Italian fare, with poor service, and over-the-top campy decor.  I realize it's part of the schtick or \"charm\" if you insist, but it's still a bit much, and serves to only slightly deflect attention away from the mediocre food. If you are not a party of 12 or more, don't expect a lot of attention."}
{"text":"Just visited this place today for lunch for the 1st time and probably won't ever return here or this chain! Place is very nice and clean but the bathrooms are in the casino o itself so you have to walk away from the restaurant cause they don't have any inside . So for our order. I got chicken parm with spaghetti and marinara and my wife got chicken parmesan with fettuccine Alfredo and we ordered an order of garlic bread. Now save your money with the garlic. Read cause for a small order it's $13 and they were pure trash. Hard and no taste of garlic whatsoever, I asked the waiter if they are made fresh and he said yes but I believe they sat since yesterday! Both meals sucked! The pasta came out barely warm but the chicken was hot so they let the pasta sit on a plate in the open while the chicken. Was being cooked! Small portions for the price you pay which is $16 for each plate. Ooo and the chicken was soggy soggy soggy! Our waiter who I will leave his name out to be nice came to take our order, bring us our plates but no extra napkins till after we were done. And then brought us out a damn check without even asking if we want yes dessert which we did so basically trying to rush us out when the restaurant is not even half packed at 12pm. Ordered a cheesecake and that's not even worth the $14. OLIVE GARDEN IS 20xs better and I'm not even exaggerating. It was just plain food that you could get at a buffet for a better the price of 1 freaking meal. Last time I come to this chain!"}
{"text":"Our family's go to celebration place! Jarrett is the best! The food is always amazing and the portions will make sure you leave completely satisfied! Chicken carbonara is one of my favorites, but today we tried the shrimp florentine. Delish!"}
{"text":"12/25/16

CALLED IN our take-out order two weeks ago (reserved with Paig).  it was scheduled for a 5:00pm pick up.  Get there and the place is a MAD HOUSE.  Now I get it, it's x-mas.  But there were several pick up orders waiting since 3:30.  We get to asking about timelines, nothing, told the manager would be out to talking to us, nothing.  Phone ringers were turned OFF!  People who paid online ask about refunds and they literally said we SHOULD be able to refund.  SHOULD?!  I don't really know the outcome for many of the other guests, my fiancé and I left after 45 minutes of people who were there HOURS before us still not having their food, and no sight of ours coming.
I get that you may have accidentally taken more reservations than you can handle, but why not contact the customers and see about picking up the food at a later time, instead of 3:30 try to get them to come in at 4:30, instead of 5 why not 5:45, etc.
We left as COPS were pulling in-no doubt because the guests were getting extremely agitated.
My family and I went to Dennys, got seated in 10 minutes and had DELICIOUS, well cooked food, great smiles from EVERY staff member.  Buca was a 6 year x-mas traditional...safe to say not anymore."}
{"text":"food is good, service is A+ and it was quick and easy to get across the river to the hockey game."}
{"text":"Great choice for a large group.  We needed to find a place near the Strip to book a dinner for more than 20 people, and we were very happy to find Buca di Beppo for the occasion.  It's family friendly and festively decorated.  The food is served all-you-can-eat family style in large bowls and platters.  We had  bread, two kinds of salads, two kinds of pastas, lemon chicken,  personized birthday cake, soft drinks, coffee for about $40 per person, tax and tip included.  Everyone liked the food, and felt it was a great value for the price."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, and the service is great! I highly recommend it, but come hungry. We always have to get take out boxes."}
{"text":"Go here with at least 4 people, as everything is served family style in huge bowls that you share. You can get a \"small\" or \"large\" of basically any dish, and they SAY the small is enough for 2, but you could get 4 light meals from one small dish pretty easily. We had a rehearsal dinner here before my friend's wedding and there were about 14 of us, which they didn't seem to have a problem with at all. The waiter was fun and cheery the whole night, never once complained, and I only had to ask twice for extra lemons for my iced tea and water (the iced tea doesn't come with lemon by default, so make sure to ask if you like it with lemon). We tried some limoncello at the end of the meal and it was the perfect end to a most delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"Family of four - enjoyed the atmosphere with all the photos and art work. Love the Italian music and kids thought it was fun. Ordered ceaser salad - a little soggy , calamari was hot but not as good as carabas, spicy chicken rigitoni was taste but was cold when served, side of fettuccini alfredo was also cold and not great. The highlight was chicken parm that was served hot and was very taste. $100 bill and not very happy. I was very excited to go but may not go again"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Soup was served cold twice even after we complained. 
The eggplant wasn't made enough, really not eatable."}
{"text":"Thank you and I will return to your restaurant, for I hope a better experience, when I am in the area. I currently reside on the East Coast and will visit in Sept."}
{"text":"So about two weeks ago my boyfriend and I went out to Buca for lunch. We had a awful experience and pretty much wrote off this location completely. Annoyed with how things had been handled (Aside from the kitchen manager Emilio) I decided to write a review explaining all of my frustrations and why I had only given them one star. Shortly after writing the review I was contacted by someone within the upper management of the company. I was pretty amazed to say the least because most complaints get swept under the rug in larger companies. Mr, Radevski was genuinely concerned about the complaint I had given, and the bad experience we had. He assured me that if I gave this location another chance I would not be disappointed, and boy was he right.

I decided to give the Robinson Buca another chance on a rather important night, my mothers birthday. I made my reservations VIA Open Table, and when we arrived we were sat promptly. As my family got comfortable our server came over to the table greeted us and really made us feel welcome. She even asked if we were celebrating anything. Dinner went splendid, our server was extremely attentive and we never went one minute needing anything. Everything came out hot and in a timely manor!  We were pleased when Chef Emilio came out to the table to check on everything periodically through the dinner. The food was absolutely delicious, the stuffed shells were to die for, and when complimenting them to the Chef he was glad to tell us a little bit about them and what makes them so tasty. Everyone in my family was very particularly pleased with the whole experience. Members of the staff even came out after our dinner was boxed up and sang to my mom for her birthday. Even though she was embarrassed, she loved it!

I couldn't have been more pleased and happy with a restaurant in my life. The Buca in Robinson really did whatever they could to make up for our previous occurrence from the excellent service this time around, to the great atmosphere from the other servers and the delicious food and desserts we enjoyed (with plenty of leftovers!) 

I just wanted to extended a sincere thank you to Elizabeth our sever for the night, Chef Emilio and Mr. Radevski. The experience could not have been better and my family and I truly appreciate your concern in making our night the best that it could have been. We will definitely be back, and I will most certainly be letting others know of how exceptional the service was this time around and that you helped make my mothers birthday the best it could be. 

Thank you very much Buca, I cant thank you enough, we will be back, especially for that Tiramisu!!!"}
{"text":"We went there last night and will never ever go again.. The waitress was rude as a mule during shoeing time.. The spaghetti and meat balls was horrible the pasta not cooked no seasoning what so ever the meat balls were dry and just down right horrible. The manager seemed not to believe us that we were just making it up but the couple behind us had the same complaint"}
{"text":"Great food with a fantastic atmosphere. The service was great and the food was served in such a manner that we felt like we were eating at home. Great Job. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Don't go.  Much better Italian places then this. Over priced, over coked. Got the veal parm probably worse I ever ate."}
{"text":"What can I say but, the food & service here was amazing!! We came here for my cousins graduation party & there was soooooo much food we all had leftovers to take home...everything was delicious from the salad & garlic bread to the spaghetti & fettuccine Alfredo with chicken to the eggplant Parmesan & last was deserts of cheesecake & chocolate cake...amazing food!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Ambience was...unique. Food was good. Not amazing, but good. We had no problem putting a dent in the giant plates of pasta. I recommend the chicken prosciutto. I'm always happy when my family of 4 (2 young kids) can eat dinner and not complain!"}
{"text":"Portions are hella big!!! Theres always always something for to-go. Tiramisu yuuuuummmm"}
{"text":"Bucca has normally been good, but yesterday was by far the worst food we have had from this chain!

The food didn't have much flavor, the chicken alfredo was dry and had the least flavor of the 3 dishes. The veal was like a mystery meat with prosciutto which taste like cheap deli ham and a bunch of capers. The pepperoni pizza was the best of the 3 dishes and even that wasn't great.

The food took a very long time and they weren't busy as we were waiting we could smell something burning yet our veal was unevenly cooked.

The 2 hostesses didn't say hi or bye, they just said how many. I should've known with that first sign to turn around and go elsewhere, we wouldn't return even for free!!

If we could give zero stars we would as they have earned it!"}
{"text":"Friendly, family style, delicious! Would recommend this place. We had the Pope Room. Hard to get but we finally got a chance. Awesome! 

Giant Lazy Susan with a bust of the current Pope. He even has a Pope Mobile casing."}
{"text":"Have a great time visiting with family friends from out of town, however regarding Buca, this will be our last visit here. Probably arrived before 6pm and for a restaurant with very few tables seated, this was the longest meal I've ever experienced. Including the 16 yrs I worked in 2 different restaurants. Got salad, then at least 40 minutes for 1 chicken dinner and 1 pasta dinner. You seriously know when you rarely see the server, including drink refills only when you mainly get up and have to ask for them, not a great experience. I always love the part when the server tells you they are short cooks in the back, yet you never see her back for over 25+ minutes, multiple times even for drinks. Which tells me she has more than she can handle. For $140 check, really difficult to even leave her 10% tip. Typically 20%, however whenever you never hear back about food coming, have to ask for drink refills multiple times, you have to wonder IF they are even staffed properly. Also as a note, the spaghetti with marinara sauce literally had a slight bleach kind of taste to it."}
{"text":"Came in for a take out order. I was pretty much ignored for a while while the bartender chatted with two girls who were sitting at the bar. Someone else eventually took my order, and it was brought in a timely manner. When I was handed my to go bag, I asked if there was a fork in the bag. She said yes. Imagine my anger when I got all the way across the casino and up a billion floors to my room and discovered I was given no fork or napkins. I had to go all the way back to the casino to grab a fork from another restaurant. Definitely regretting leaving a tip!

UPDATE 8/8/13- I was contacted by management who more than made amends for my inconvenience. Super impressed with how much they care about their guests!"}
{"text":"Good food and good prices!
Once my lasagna was overcooked but I forgive them because it was the exception.
The atmosphere is a lot of fun and the servers are always pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Well, we had Valentine's reservations for 2/14/16 for at least two weeks, since it's also my daughter's birthday. Our reservations were at 7:30pm.....we were a group of 8. About 9:00 pm we were still waiting for our table. They told us, and the group in front of us that the people stayed too long before us...but did not at all try to apologize or help us with another option of 2 table of 4. The manager just sat there and loudly complained about everyone complaining to her. She needs a new job, and we will never EVER go back. Lost a good customer Buca. You have no idea."}
{"text":"I went for dinner when I was in town for business and therefore, I was alone. Seeing that I often go to the bar to eat, I was a bit put off when there were absolutely zero people in the bar area... the entire night. That's probably because the bar is completely removed from the restaurant. So that right there sort of made me feel a bit awkward, not even being able to feel the vibe of the rest of the place. 

I'll start off that I've been to Buca several times at different locations and have always love the atmosphere, food, vibe, etc. So please note this review is only for this particular Buca. 

I started with a cocktail (sorta bland and weak) and ordered a Caesar salad and baked ravioli. The bartender was kind enough to remind me the portions are large and said I could even order off the lunch menu. I really appreciated that. He then brought out some boring soft bread (a la Subway) with flavorless olive oil. I decided to wait for something better. 

The Caesar was OK.. nothing better than any average Caesar you would get anywhere else. Probably even less interesting than the store bought Cardini dressing I buy at the supermarket. The croutons were the best part. 

The baked cheese ravioli was pretty good. They came in a fresh marinara sauce with melted mozzarella cheese on them. The sauce was a nice fresh balance to the heavier cheese, though the ravioli themselves were light and very nice. 

Oh, I also had a glass of their 'best' Chianti by the glass.. ugh.. tasted like two buck chuck.. I don't think so, especially if you're an Italian restaurant. 

Overall, three stars for OK.. nothing special, I probably won't go back but won't discourage anyone else. I'm sure I'll check out another Buca again, just not this one."}

{"text":"We went for Thanksgiving Dinner.  Went came hungry and left hungry and APPALLED!  The food, traditional Thanksgiving and regular menu items, was uniformly bland, dry and basically uneatable.  When we arrived the place was packed but emptied out within an hour because most people, like us, left early.  Our waiter and busboy stopped coming to our table, except to give us our bill, the moment we told them everything served was terrible."}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception here. The price packaging was fantastic considering we're on the strip. There were a few hiccups. The wrong drinks were placed in carafes (sangria instead of wine, and no one really likes sangria in my group), we were never served garlic bread even though it was supposed to be part of our wedding package, and our wedding cake was served well past our 2 hour allotted dinner (but it was taken off the final bill) Food was great, and services was also great, and surprisingly quick considering we had a party of thirty."}
{"text":"we called to make a 5:30 pm reservation to celebrate our anniversary. The hostess asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, at which I told her.
 When we arrived, the host walking us to our table asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. We told him it was our anniversary.
 we were then seated at a table in the middle of the room facing the kitchen.( I figured that with so early a reservation we might get a more discreet, less noisy table).
 We sat for 10 minutes when we were approached by a busy but kindly  waitress who then asked (if you can believe it ) if we were celebrating a special occasion . Realizing there was obviously no communication between host and server, we told the occasion for the third time.
 While the waitress was getting our drink another server  came to the table to get our drink and tell us the specials. We told her we were already being served . She then got annoyed and told us she would be right back, obviously to chew out the other server who started us.
 She then came back and told us She would be our server. So we then gave her our drink order and she Id me and my middle aged husband.
 Our caesar salad arrived, which we enjoyed
(it was brought by another server) . Just before dinner arrived another server brought our drinks. Both of them wrong. I sent my  drink back, my husband kept the wrong one they gave him.
 Our dinner was excellent ( the eggplant parm is done perfectly there).
 After dinner the waitress asked if we wanted dessert as she was cleaning off our table. At this point we told her no.  Having told 3 people about our anniversary and then being ignored and given attitude by our server I was royally turned off.
  Perhaps in the future we'll do take-out. I know Buca isn't a 5 star place, didn't expect it to be. But we'll save our special occasions for places that at least pretend to care."}
{"text":"Wow. I've had better pasta out of a can.  If you don't have a litter of kids to feed this is not the place for anyone who's ever had anything close to real Italian food. We ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce and spicy sausage with ricotta. As you can see from the photo the sauce seems to be missing from the pasta. However there was a generous portion of red water in the bottom of the bowl. Our server was really nice and I feel bad that he is working at such a terrible restaurant having to tell people they get a TON of food. As if that made up for zero quality. We spent too much money for about 3 bites of food. The rest will go in the garbage. I've seen better food at soup kitchens. We will never be back and will never regret it. This was our first visit and it seemed everyone else's first visit also at the tables around us. They must rely on first time business since its doubtful anyone will ever come back."}
{"text":"Honestly the spaghetti and pizza was so bland and disgusting I felt like I can go home and make better food than that. I'll never forget how gross it was and I'll never go again."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian restaurant. Everything I've tried here was very good. My favorite dish is the baked ziti and the chopped salad is one of the best I've ever had. The portions are HUGE, so bring the family or a few friends along to share a meal."}
{"text":"The server LUIS is the worst. 
On top of that, since when are we not allowed to pay the difference on items if we have a coupon and want to upgrade?? It's ridiculous. We wanted to upgrade our salad to the apple gorgonzo and had to pay a $3 difference WHICH WAS FINE. But we can't????? What."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but we have never had such horrible service! Waitress just didn't care that water need refilled, that she messed up appetizer, that she messed up pasta. When we asked for manager no one brought him. Have never left a zero tip for over $200 but today we did."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  There was lots, but quality did not suffer.  Wait staff professional and helpful.  I can't wait to take my wife and family!"}
{"text":"The wife and I had lunch here today.  The soup was barely warm and under cooked.  The salad was brown and limp. The spagetti was swimming in water. The spicy chicken riggatoni was ok.  The worst part of this meal for the both of us was the after taste.  Six hours after eating we cann't stop belching nor get rid of the after taste.

This is not somewhere well be going back to."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this Buca! Coordinator Ashley is amazing! Planning a wedding out of state while attempting to bring together families from two different cultures for a large event is a difficult task but Ashley and the Buca crew helped make that dream come true! Our rehearsal dinner was a huge success! Everyone loved the food! Everyone had a great time and it's all because of the staff being attentive, welcoming, and personable. They made us feel right at home! And huge thank you to Ashley the bartender who helped us out together a custom photo shoot for myself and the bridesmaids that I'll never forget! You guys are amazing! Thank you for making my special day one to remember :)."}
{"text":"Went here for sisters birthday last Wednesday and we all had a great time! We had about 15 guests and we all shared 3-4 different entree's as a group. Excellent service by Ricky, he was very patient and anything we wanted he was sure to help us with and did it in a prompt manner. The food was amazing like always and we left very full and happy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Service and Great atmosphere. It would be awesome though to expand on a non-animal option on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I made reservations for October 17, 2015 for a leisurely evening out.  Upon arrival we were seated in \"the bar.\"  One generally thinks this would be for adults only but not here.  Within a few minutes, a party was seated next to us with 4 adults, two kids around 8 or 10 yrs old and one toddler.  The toddler screamed the entire meal; one of the older kids yelled every word he spoke and the other kid was quiet.  During the meal, at least three other tables were seated near them and all asked to be moved to another room because this table was so disruptive.  It took forever to get every single item within every single course and was left to sit and listen to this catastrophe in between.  The bartender was our \"server\" and when she had time, she would go check on our meal.

Now to the meal.  The food was in the category of barely edible.  What we didn't eat, we took home and the next day, just threw it away.  It was horrible.  We spent a little over $100 for a shared appetizer, a shared plain pasta dish, an order of bread, 2 glasses of wine and a dessert.  By the time it was over we just wanted out.  We will never go back to this dump again."}
{"text":"Spaghetti suck s really cheap my wife makes better tasting then this crapp really pizza really is that wat they call it plz! !  Yes I'm very disappointed way overpriced for less then average wannabe Italian food. Sorry people but just make it at home and it will still be better."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this restaurant! Our waitress was amazing. If you come here ask for PAULA because she has an amazing personality. Paula was always checking on us making sure our food was made well, and was making sure we had the best possible experience. I will come back again just for her!"}
{"text":"OMG! it was a friends birthday and the service ,table and surroundings were awful!
If they were having a bad night it was definitely 03/28/13 ( mark it down) the food was like thrown together because of the rush for dinner service. It was as if a bus load of tourist came in ;and the staff was surprised. But these seemed like locals out with the family. I don't know what but we ALL were DISAPPOINTTED!"}
{"text":"Jarrett was our server, he was very friendly and helpful We got spaghetti and meatballs and it was really good"}
{"text":"I had suggested this restaurant to someone visiting from out of town because I had enjoyed locations in California previously but had never been to this one.  I then saw the horrible reviews here before going and was worried.  But I can honestly say the whole experience was perfect. Got seated right away waitress took orders and food came quickly.  We had spaghetti and meatballs, eggplant parmigiana and garlic bread.  It was delicious.   I recommend this if you like Italian food!!"}
{"text":"The Food: Not terrible. We got the large Chicken Parm which was great. I wouldn't expect anything else since they pride themselves on being an authentic Italian place. We also got a small Ziti with Chicken, but we didn't like the sauce and there was barely any chicken.

The Service: Good. No complaints, we got a younger girl who was very polite and friendly. She stayed on top of our drinks and overall did a great job.

The Decor: Older run down inside. The outside looks fine, but the booths, carpet, and antiques were all outdated and looked like they needed some love. They did walk us through the kitchen on the way to our seats and that was probably the cleanest kitchen I've ever seen.

The Desserts: I got a lemon raspberry cake that was really good. I saw someone else get a HUGE brownie sundae goblet they said would feed 6 or something crazy. It looked intense."}
{"text":"Service was average, dinner was average & dessert was a disappointment served in a large bowl...."}
{"text":"We went here for Thanksgiving but had Italian instead of the turkey that was also offered. We had the prosciutto and cheese stuffed chicken and baked ziti-it was fantastic. Not terribly crazy about the cheese garlic bread but nevertheless our meal was great."}
{"text":"Made a reservation through open table .... When we arrived they did not have our reservation and told us we made it too late - 2hrs in advance was too late. :( ... Made us wait in line with everyone else.

Update: got seated 15 minutes later, in a nice booth.

Update: got a glass of wine smelling like vinegar with 3 flies in it ... Wow you can't beat this!! ... Called manager - he apologized - that's it. Replaced the glass (opened a bottle in front of us)

Update: food ... Choose Olive Garden over this place."}
{"text":"Poor service and very mediocre meal. You get what you pay for here$13 chicken Parm was rubber and pasta over cooked with blaw sauce. It was hot though! Make sure you get Parmesan cheese to give it some flavor!!!! Won't recommend unless your desperate for Italian. 

Service was slow and server was not attentive."}
{"text":"A liitle over priced for pizza but it was delicious and they cant even give away a free dessert for the Birthday guest kinda lame in my opinion because we asked for a scoop of ice cream and it was only 99 cents which I didnt mind paying for but ever birthday guest likes a free dessert...just saying"}
{"text":"Food & service are good but the place is weird there is tons and tons of photographs there & some of them make you sick when you are eating and looking at them at the same time. Only good if you are a serious picture fan"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for after dinner drinks on Saturday night with my wife and our friend. We sat on the patio. It was a beautiful night in Scottsdale.The waitress brought out water and took our drink orders. We never saw her again. We left after 20 minutes. We walked next door to the restaurant to the south and had several drinks there. When we left for the evening we walked by the patio and our water were still sitting on the table. Can't review on how the food or beverages are. You have to be served first. Other than ordering over $25.00 in drinks, I'm not sure what we did wrong? No return to this venue."}
{"text":"Parking is great,
Food portions are huge, best to share
However the service is slow.
Seated at 7pm,
Appetizer at 7:30
Salads at 8
I had to make sure food comes out faster cuz I have to show to catch."}
{"text":"Okay, just last Thursday night my wife and I went to Buca di Beppo and had an incredible dinner.  We split the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, and it was absolutely incredible.  We also had the lobster sauce appetizer that was to die for.  The atmosphere is a typical fun Italian style atmosphere, and our waiter was wonderful.  Old Town Scottsdale is always a fun place to go, and if you're there try Buca di Beppo.  I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! The bathrooms are in the kitchen and practically have shit on the walls. Service is less than mediocre. Disgusting. Repulsive!"}
{"text":"Walked in for dinner hostest tells me they're not taking any more walk ins. Well, the first host could have informed us as soon as we walked in instead of having us wait around as if we were going to be seated. Next time you decide to close your restaurant for a private event why don't you have it clearly stated. Ridiculous. I'll spend my money at capos because they're food is wayyyyy better then buca di caca! Everybody go to capos!! Ciao"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Server was rude. Never greeted us at all. First words were asking if we knew what we wanted to drink. She wasn't pleasant when we tried to ask a few questions. We ordered the Baked Ziti. The pictures looked great but we actually received a plate of very dry noodles. There was no sauce anywhere; not even under the top layer. I couldn't believe it. The couple of spoonfuls of ricotta was the only good thing. I was really looking forward to some good Italian food. Their poster in the Excalibur Casino reeled me in. We were really disappointed and will not be eating there again. I think Excalibur should remove them."}
{"text":"It took us an hour-and-a-half to get into Scottsdale's Buca di Beppo.  And this was right after a Giants game in spring training (March).

I think one of the problems was that there are very few tables for two.  There are tables for four, tables for six or eight aplenty.  This is a family restaurant.

You know something?  It was worth it.  Absolutely incredible meal, and very friendly service.  Just a wonderful experience.  Except for the waiting part."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited for 25 min just to try to pay bill. 15 min to get beer......Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Over priced bad italian food. I would not recommend this bad experience to anyone.  Server half your age will ask for ID, upon ordering a drink, Really!!! I came to dine not to be insulted!!!!  My ravioli was luke warm at best my husband combo plate was over cooked and pasta was dried out and $11 for garlic bread really!!!! Which came way before the meal by then the cheese on it was cold and hard.  I would not return if it was free...let the diner beware:("}
{"text":"Tried to order takeout online, website wasn't updated for new menu items.  Called for twenty minutes to try placing an order that way.  No answer.  Walked in, asked for a manager, whose response was, sorry, don't have enough staff to just answer the phone & walked away.  If I hadn't had a gift card to use, I would have walked out.  Terrible customer service.  There are too many other choices.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to host a private party look no further - Anthony and his team are stellar!  I booked a dinner presentation event at this restaurant and being located in Florida and flying in for the event makes event planning a bit more difficult.  But Bucca Di Beppo here in Peoria made it a breeze.  From the planning to the execution everything was very well done!  Anthony delivered as promised and the professional staff members, Tiffany and Amanda, who were assigned to our dinner event were great!  They were not only professional, very efficient, but also took great care in handling everything quietly as possible as they had to deliver food, etc during our presentation.  Anthony, thank you for everything!  Tiffany and Amanda, a HUGE thank you to you both, you were awesome!!!!  Anthony, both Tiffany and Amanda are a huge asset to your restaurant!  Thanks again for everything!
All my best,
Lindsay :)"}
{"text":"We ate here after my goddaughter's Confirmation and First Communion.  Reservations were made ahead of time for 17 people and the menu was selected ahead of time since we were a large group.  I've been to the Bucca in San Francisco, but it's been awhile so my review here does not have any reflection on that location.

When we first arrived, we were brought through the kitchen. I imagine it was supposed to be a tour of some sort. But, honestly, the hostess didn't tell us anything about the restaurant or why it would be any different than any other kitchen.  There was a booth in there. So, I guess that meant it is available if you wanted to sit in the kitchen to watch them prepare the food.

We were placed in a \"private\" room on the second floor that was long and I think they had three tables arranged end to end. There ended up only being 15 of us, so it would have been nice if they made more room my removing some of the chairs.  Every time the server came, she bumped into someone and most of the food was placed on one end of the tables since she couldn't fit to make it to the tables that were further in.  So, I give the accommodation two stars.

Since we ordered ahead of time, we would have thought that once the drinks were served, the first course of salads would have come out immediately.  Our reservation was for 1, we didn't get that first course until about 1:45.  What's the use of ordering ahead of time, if you are going to wait?  The main course of pasta dishes came out a little more quickly.  Refills were a bit slow coming out.  We asked for boxes for the leftovers (we had a lot of them) and you would have thought that dessert would have come out shortly after we had asked for the boxes.  But, they boxed up all the dishes first, put the bags aside and we waited another 10 minutes or so before she asked if the dessert should be brought out.  Again, what's the use of ordering ahead of time, if you are going to wait.  So, I give them two stars for service (I should also mention that it was not that busy so that it was understable for the long wait).

As for the food, it was pretty decent. There was certainly a lot of it since we ordered family style.  We probably would have been fine if we ordered half of what we actually got.  I imagine they based it based on the number of people, even though I don't think they should have counted the kids.  So, I would give the food three stars.

Overall, I would eat at this restaurant again. Can't say it's my favorite and that I would go out of my way for it.  But, I think it's an overall three stars."}
{"text":"Be sure to specify small. Wife ordered pasta, I ordered small pizza. The brought her the family size pasta and charged us $26.00 for it."}
{"text":"Gross! Marinara sauce for pasta was super sweet. They charge extra for bread. Salad was ok but small. Meatball was big but not good."}
{"text":"On April 21, 2016 me and my husband went in Buca di Beppo Lake Mead Location for lunch. Our server was Jessica. Although there was a conference meeting event on that time and she's busy she made our dining experience a good one. She knows how to handle her customers to be comfortable and relaxed. We love the foods, Chicken Limone, Chicken Parmigiana and Fried Calmari, the ambience and the music. We love Buca di Beppo . Salute to Jessica, keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on Saturday around 1:30p. Rarely come to Buca, had $10 off coupon from mail. There were about 2 other tables occupied. Chicken carbonara was delicious, not for health-conscious folks. Eggplant parmigiana was very good too. Service was fast and efficient. The only issue was, we were asked whether we would like bread, I said yes and chose garlic. I didn't know it would cost $6.99, wasn't told either. I thought it would be complimentary like breadsticks in Olive Garden. Didn't make it a big deal because everything else was good plus the coupon helped."}
{"text":"Came to this location with my boyfriend and was seated quickly, in the bar area with 0 other people around us. (Very awkward) It was very quiet except for the servers that kept talking across the room to the bartender about drinks and other guests. Once the bartender made eye contact with us we realized he was actually also our server. He was very nice and friendly but the level of service here is awful. Once he took our order he offered us house bread and said he would be right back. Our entrees came out first(and were cold). Then our appetizer. Followed by our \"server\" smelling like smoke. Maybe if he hadn't been on a smoke break we would have gotten our food correctly. Then after we were almost finished with our food he brought us a cold bread basket....  Thanks but no thanks. Waste of money. With all the places to eat at in vegas this is definitely last on the list."}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatballs was just average at best although the meatball was good. However if you tell me I can't remove peppers from my pizza because the ingredients are all bagged.... That means your pizza ingredients are not fresh, they're cut somewhere else,  they're frozen,  and then they are shipped to you....i do not plan to eat here again.  This is the first time I've ever had a waitress tell me they can't make a pizza the way I want... Which is freaking weird.  This store is very dark it's very hard to read the menu or pick off peppers because the light is so dim. Now that I think about it the place kind of creeped me out."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to go to Buca for her birthday dinner, so the whole family went along. My experience this time was much better than the first.

I had a coupon for a free small appetizer. Our waitress told us that the amount could be used toward a large size appetizer, which was helpful.

Service was very good. Our appetizer was the Cheesy Bread Florentine, which was very good. We followed with the Chopped Antipasto Salad, which was also very good. Our past dish was the Chicken and Sausage Zita, which was heavily spiced and a winner in our book. We had a few drinks which zoomed up the total bill.

I was happy that the evening went so well. Although the food was much better this visit, I believe this chain is a tad too pricey for what you get. It would not rate nearly as high as a chain like The Old Spaghetti Factory for value."}
{"text":"Sooooo... where to begin.... Disappointment. That's a good beginning. It had been a few years since last eating here. We had talked about it in passing, but never seemed to make it back. One of the biggest reasons was mainly because of the large division of what we liked versus what the other person liked. Since they are a family style restaurant, that alone made it difficult trying to decide on something we would both eat. Now we find ourselves on date night trying to pick a place to eat. We were going to the movies and Buca was convenient. We made a reservation to avoid waiting. We arrived and waited about 15 minutes for the reservation. It was the weekend, so this isn't all that uncommon. While being seated I noticed that everything was very corporate kitschy. The hostess seating us took us on the \"tour\" and droned on in a monotone voice about the place before seating us. The restaurant was fairly busy, with several large parties. It took our server a good 5-10 minutes to greet us. We gave her our drink order Water & soda). As I had been very ill the previous week, no alcohol was ordered and this seemed to disappoint the server. There was a marginal wait again for the drinks. She droppped them off and then said she would be back to take our order. By this point we have been sitting here for 20 minutes and I am hungry! She finally comes back and we give her our order. Bruschetta and Chicken Marsala. I asked for a small side of plain pasta to go with the chicken. She said ok and off she went. A food runner brought out the bruschetta. It was a quarter loaf of sliced, toasted bread with fresh tomatoes and basil. Not the best I have ever had, but the tomatoes were very fresh and they were plentiful. Our entree arrived about 10 minutes later. The chicken looked very good with a small scattering of large plump mushrooms and they had not forgotten the plain pasta. It was accompanied by a huge bowl of marsala sauce. I dished up some chicken and pasta for our plates and we got started. I'd like to say it was as good as it looked, but sadly that is not the case. The Marsala sauce was so horribly sweet, it was more like a syrup and made the entree completely inedible. The mushrooms tasted as if they had been candied. The side of pasta was stone cold. I got the servers attention and let her know. She seemed completely unphased by it and informed me that she \"heard that alot\" and it was almost always returned. Ok. So I asked \" why didn't you tell me this when I ordered it? \" She gave me a shoulder shrug and asked if I wanted her to take it back. Umm yes. I'm not eating that. She asked if we would like something else. At this point, I'm not feeling very positve about the experience and hesitant to get anything else. We asked about the lemon chicken and said we would give that a try. As soon as she left, a table next to us leaned over and advised us against ordering that as well. He told us the only safe bet there was to just eat pasta. He said the only reason he was even there was because the kids liked it otherwise he would never eat there.  We flagged someone down and told them to cancel our order and to just bring us the check. The check arrived for the full amount. I got our server and asked why we were being charged for the chicken. She was noncommittal and simply picked the check up and walked away. At this point I would like to point out that the side of plain pasta had been rung up as a side of spaghetti marinara and was $6. WHAT? She returned with an updated check and I pointed out to her that not only had I not ordered a side of spaghetti marinara, the side we had ordered was not eaten because the chicken was not eaten. She gave a \"put upon\" huff and said she would be back. She returned with another updated check and we gave her the card for the 1 drink and a coupon for the appetizer. Not once did a manager come by or was there ever a real \"I'm sorry you didn't like your meal\".  While I have no problem paying for what I order,  most restaurants would have just nulled the bill instead of running a debit for 1 soda, this place was more assembly line. I can honestly say that was my LAST visit to this establishment. I don't really know how you can screw up Italian food, but they seem to be doing a damn good job of it."}
{"text":"We love this Italian Restaurant.  Decorated with great photos, friendly staff but suffers from a poor location near the Mall food court.  My wife makes great Lasagna, but even she says Buca's version is the best she has ever had!!  Some will not like the family style serving at dinner, but overall the product is outstanding."}
{"text":"I was embarrassed after suggesting this location to visiting family. We had three small children in our group. You think we could get some crayons? No bread. No refills. No bussing the table. The waiter didn't address anyone at the table, he just stood there looking at us. He just sets a stack of plates next to me and walks away as the appetizer was being served. He Recommended only two large entrees to feed 8 people. We didn't bother to order more (we were all taking about where to go to dinner as we were paying the check) because we had been there an hour and a half already. Buca is usually a decent pick for a big group with kids, but this location is atrocious. They also ruined the quaint little decor that the chain is known for... just sayin..."}
{"text":"We had our family reunion in Vegas this year.  As we were planning our dinner, we decided to try Buca di Beppo.  Since we had a large party (40), we wanted a place that was family friendly, could cater a large group, and off the strip.  I worked with Trish.   She was awesome, very flexible and responsive. She also suggested entrees that were popular for our banquet dinner.  When we arrived, our table was set up.  As our party straggled in, the servers were greeted everyone and made sure folks had their drinks.  I was worried about the food but the servers and kitchen staff planned this nicely.  Everything was smooth for our dinner.  Thanks Buca Staff..."}
{"text":"The food here is alright. It wasn't amazing and I probably could have just dined at the Olive Garden and been just as content. Our server definitely hated her job but once I got to talking to her she lightened up a bit. We didn't feel entirely cared about as guests in the restaurant but I'm not complaining too much. It wasn't bad it just wasn't great.

It's decorated really cool, there's a lot to look at and I think it would be great for large parties especially with kids.

But the garlic bread made me want to give this place five stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Mmm table bread, Mountain Dew, & Caesar Salads!!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. They used to give you a full size dessert free on your birthday and used to have pretty decent coupons. Now, the chicken is stringy and can't even be chewed easily and they don't even give you a mini size brownie sundae on your birthday. They are such cheapskates that they don't even give you a wedge of lemon to squeeze on your lemon chicken anymore. The management is just trying to squeeze you for every last buck they can."}
{"text":"A more cheesey and expensive olive garden. The food is greasy and sits like a lump in your stomach."}
{"text":"I went to this location with my nieces and had a great experience. The food was delicious and the service was great. It was a little busy but it was expected for a Saturday night. Great for large parties and don't forget to tip your server!"}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo hosted our reception dinner following our wedding at The ARIA on August 20, 2016. My husband and I chose Buca because Italian is my favorite cuisine, we loved the food when we visited on our last trip and I enjoy the family-style serving of the dishes. (I also love the Excalibur!) The set-up was absolutely great!! We had 35-40 people attend our destination wedding and were given the Wine Room. It is a private area right off the main entrance from the casino, through double glass doors. We had the room reserved for our party for three hours and, months prior to our event, we sent a schedule of how we would like the evening to flow to the event coordinator. The dishes came out right on time, were exactly what we ordered from the catering menu and with more than enough to feed an army! Our adult beverages were never empty, in fact, we had a fresh one waiting for us before we even finished the previous one. Every request was promptly fulfilled by a smiling face. EVERYTHING was absolutely flawless! The servers were so attentive and personable to everyone in our party. Our guests raved about the experience, service, food and employees. I would absolutely, 100% recommend this Buca di Beppo location to anyone hosting an event in Las Vegas! The food is just wonderful and the hospitality is unmatched! Thank you so much Buca for playing a huge part in our wedding day and making our guests, who flew across the country to celebrate with us, full and happy!! I could not be happier with our reception dinner choice and there is not one thing that I could recommend for improvement! Can't wait to come back!!!!! And please, open a location in Oklahoma City soon!! I need my Buca fix! Lol! :D"}
{"text":"This place is horribly managed. Reservations mean nothing!! We arrived  10 minutes before our reservations only to be told it would be another 40min. to an hour for our table to be ready. We left. I will not wait an hour for average Italian food!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, but not great.  They advertise (and deliver) HUGE portions, but I don't find that approach particularly appetizing.  For me, it's best when going out with a big group."}
{"text":"HUGE portions! Great family restaurant! Staff was very friendly and the food was great!! 1 dish serves 2+ people so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"We have dined at Buca before, but it had been a long time ago and boy did we forget how great the food is here! We started off with the di Beppo salad, so fresh and the Italian dressing was so flavorful.  We shared the supreme pizza and WOW, large topping, super fresh ingredients so full of flavor. For dinner we shared the carbonara. Our server Jake suggested sautéed shrimp with the dish and it was just perfect. We finished the meal with the chocolate cake. The food was superb and the personal service from Jake just made the evening perfect. We can't wait to go back!! Thanks Buca!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service from everyone that has been involved with my catering order- Karina F. (at Olo support) as well as Serena, Erik, Breana, and Manager Mike N. (at Arrowhead Buca). I didn't receive the food due to a glitch on the online ordering service, Olo. There was a mix up with the date and the employees said they couldn't accommodate. I've worked in the restaurant business along with holiday catering orders; there's always a solution rather than turning a customer away. 
I inquired about this issue through Olo and through Buca at arrowhead. Three times I've been told it will be refunded and taken care of (phone, email, and in person visit). I still do not have the $100 refund as promised by Olo Support and the Manager at Buca (I paid for an order I never received 7 weeks ago)."}
{"text":"Wow.  Went for lunch and dropped 100... Because you can only order group dishes... Then at the end waitress mentioned a lunch menu...  Haha on us. She had no tables that day so why not miss mentioning that so she gets some tips I guess?! Food classic Italian and slightly above average for that genre. Ambiance is great and the reason to go.  Will never go back though after spending 100 for a 40 dollar lunch. So got us once but that is it forever..."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Good food at great prices! Their meal portions are HUGE so either go when extremely hungry or share plates! :) 

Ordered the salmon and house salad; they were delicious!

They are pretty busy so I would recommend a reservation if possible. Despite them being busy, their customer service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome! We came here for my cousins graduation with a party of 12. We got a table right away as we reserved one. I had pizza, mozzeralla triangles, and the COLOSSAL brownie sundae. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Great time with awesome service. Highly recommend reservations on a weekend night, I made mine online via yelp walked in and was sat for party of 5,heard  1 1/2 hour wait for walk up although by 8 there wasn't any wait. We were waited on by Sierra who did a great job as busy as they were, always topping off drinks,etc. The only thing I missed was valet parking as parking on a Saturday night gets tough downtown old Scottsdale ,overflow parking on lot next door if available."}
{"text":"Worst ever dining experience.  The veal parmigiano was not good veal.  It was a veal patty.  Everything is ala carte. Makes for a very pricey dinner. And to make things even worse, we were seated next to a table of 4 people (3 guys and 1 woman) whose loud conversation and every other word was F this and F that was very annoying.  With so many great Italian restaurants in town, we will not be returning to this one for sure."}
{"text":"I love this chain, but at this location the service was quite slow.  We had a big group, the only people in one of the 'rooms' of the restaurant, but it seemed to take a long time to get water, appetizers, entrees, etc.  Food was great though."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant. Started off with calamari it's overpriced and not worth it. Than we were given the wrong food and overcharged for it at the end of the meal. When we first got there we asked to split the bill but when we received it that was not the case. She took our cards first then split the bill which was very odd to my friend and I. Overall highly dissatisfied with our experience and very disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 7pm on Christmas Day. When we got there they said it would be another hour to be seated and another hour for food because the kitchen was behind. I get they were busy being one of the few restaurants open but a call to let people know would have been nice, we wouldn't have wasted our time driving 30 minutes. So we waited outside in the cold with our two little kids for a few minutes before deciding it wasn't worth it. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I went in today after visiting the restaurant yesterday for dinner.  This evening I stopped to get the Fett. Alfredo to go with the coupon I had from signing up with the e-club program.  We decided to sit and eat a dessert while the dish was prepared to go.  The dish arrived as if we were going to eat it right then,  I told the hostess who took the order and brought the dish that it was to go.  I even told her before we took a seat at the bar that it was to go and we will eat a dessert here.  No problem on that.  But not listening is an issue.  

Next problem was the dessert.  The bar tender took the order which was also pointed to him on the menu that we want the Italian creme cake.  However we got a Celebration Wedge Cake.  An ugly and most awful tasting cake I have eaten.  Generally I do not order cakes in the US because they are certainly not like European cakes to begin with.  We ate a bit and took the rest (not sure why to be honest) but I was so pissed.  I even told the bartender it was the worst dessert I had ever eaten as he asked me how was the dessert.  He did not say much and took my payment - $9.45 for one awful colorful red/yellow/green (Italian flag) cake that had the entire bottle of food color thrown in of red and green.  I never eat food color however this was one sick tasting cake.  The cream or whatever it was (not cream by New Zealand standards) was so sweet and fake tasting - I am madder than mad if that is even possible. One for not getting what I ordered and then eating some crap that is presented as a dessert that I never ordered.  I did ask the bartender about it but he said nothing. Overpriced for what I got. Cheap looking dessert .  And they called it a Celebration Wedge Cake - not sure what there is to celebrate.

This place is nothing but drama - not sure what I patronized it 3 times in one month; need to have my head examined.  I will only be deceived once!"}
{"text":"Food good as usual but server was walking around like a chicken without a head table that was seated four behind us had 6 more touches compared to our 3 . Water not filled until check finally showed up. Came in hungry and left thristy."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here before! Went for my birthday last night and everything from the DELICIOUS food to the service was incredible! Our waitress was super nice and helpful, and whoever the tall man was who served the table next to us was extremely patient and helpful with his table. He was super nice seeing how they arrived minutes after closing time. He took his time with them and never acted irritated. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite places to go when I have family visiting. The large portions can feed a whole family. The calamari is one of the best I have eaten, so that is a must have."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!! Our server even heard us talk about catering and she brought me all the info for it."}
{"text":"My family of 5 went for dinner on a Monday night. We were seated right away. We were served by Jarrett and he was excellent. Food was also great. Highly recommend! Nice family restaurant, great service, great food."}
{"text":"Great for large groups.  We got the Pope room, round table, lazy Susan with a pope bust in the middle.  Came for lunch so not too crowded or loud.  Ordered family style.  Love the antipasto salad.  Other food is good but not great."}
{"text":"Tons of food!!!! This place is family style so please bring at least four people with you. The portions are huge. Any alcohol purchases will just add $$$ to your bill so watch out. The food is good, probably a notch and a half from olive garden. American style Italian food at its best."}
{"text":"I used to really like it here, but now everytime I go I end up dissapointed. Its really not that good and so overpriced. I do love the decor and the family dinning they support it allows you to really spend time with the people you came with."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken parmesan with fettuccine and Caesar salad. Even though it was first thing in the morning the salad lettuce was already wilted. The chicken parmesan was decent. The fettucini was a little dry and flavorless. The reason I give this restaurant three stars because the customer service is outstanding."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a few birthdays and a graduation there, and while we had a large party, the service was awful. I sat at one of the far ends of the table and it took three of us to flag down the waitress serving us just so I could get something to drink. My drink was not refilled the entire night and neither of the two waiters attending to us bothered to ask to refill it for me. Is that really too much to ask? Also, whenever I tried to ask for a refill, they went to the opposite end of the room. Several times they pointedly looked at my empty glass, but none of them said a word about it! I have worked in the customer service business before and that was absolutely appalling. Food wise, the salad was a bit overdressed, the pasta was slightly over done, the chicken marsala was way to sweet for my liking, and the tiramisu was a bit dry. The decor was atrocious (I would rather not have to look at a statue of a naked man while I am eating) and the walls were covered in pictures of half-naked people and pin-up girls. Not to mention the fact that we had small children with us. Overall, the food was alright but the service was absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will certainly not be returning."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 was seated before noon, waited 15 minutes for server, got up to let someone know we had been waiting without service, returned to find hostess seating a couple across from us who were waited on almost immediately..... haven't left a restaurant in years but was so put out from total disregard for customer service..... left the Excalibur to find great service at the Mandalay. ...."}
{"text":"Love Buca in general. This particular place sets the bar high for other Bucas. Great food (as usual), excellent service and prices. We had the spaghetti marinara and pizza. My 18 month old made a bit of a mess but they were cool with that. Give them a great tip. 

Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for large group, and food is tasty!"}
{"text":"Was seated right away, this was nice, but then waited for 8 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there.

Disappointed with the service and quality and quantity of food.  Been a while since eating here and the portion sizes have become smaller.  We ordered the Supreme Pizza, they said it would feed 3 easily-if you are a muchkin!.

We had a waiter in training, someone should have trained his trainer.  After asking her not to take the salad, she did anyway.  That was part of my dinner.  All she could say was oh- really oh!

Main course came out in stages and we had to wait to eat so it was all there.  Family style dining, I like, but the main course should be brought out together.

Expressed my dislike for the calamari - only to be ignored.

We had to ask for our beverages 3 times before they brought all of them.

Overall, the trainee, was kind and as attentive as he knew how to be.  But will not go back."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Buca, the people are always friendly, the food is always delicious and the decor is so fun.  I know you don't always get great service at a restaurant every time, but I've been lucky here.  I've always had competent and friendly service.    My only complaint here is the prices are a little on the high side for Italian food.  Coming from an Italian family, I know pasta is not usually too expensive too make (depending on the dish), and, I've seen it time and again on the news and in articles that Italian food is the most overpriced food out there.  With that said, I took advantage of the e-mail club and visit whenever I get a good coupon to use - that, with the fun decor and friendly staff, makes this place a keeper on my list."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the food. 
Atmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders. 
Waiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) 
Too expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone here for several years (at least the last 12 years). This was our go-to place for celebrations including birthdays, our anniversary, successes at work, and anything else in-between. Depending on the circumstance, we usually eat at this location roughly 4-6 times a year. We both feel like the dining experience has gone down significantly in the last couple of years. Prices have increased, portion sizes and quality of the food have gone down, and the service seems a lot less enthusiastic.This is tremendously heartbreaking. After our experience tonight, I don't think we'll be back for a while. 

The restaurant wasn't terribly busy, but we were seated in a small room with a large party of high school-aged girls (twelve girls plus parents). Why they would sit just two people in a their smallest dining room with very exuberant teens is a mystery, especially since other parts of the restaurant were much more sparsely seated. Buca is rarely quiet, but this particular seating arrangement was puzzling. Why stick us in a room  that packed? It made for a pretty loud and jarring dining experience. 

Aesthetics aside, the food wasn't great. The calamari was virtually flavorless. The sauce and pasta for our main dish was decent, but the chicken in our meal tasted and looked like the value-brand, microwaveable chicken you can buy next to the lunch meat in they grocery store. It was pretty disgusting and was definitely not a good cut of meat

The service was also lackluster. Our waitress seldom returned to our table. She only offered to refill our glasses once... after we had asked for the check! 

I wish I could say that this was a one-off bad experience, but it has sadly become common in the last couple of years. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants anyway, but I've always told others that Buca was the exception. That's not the case any longer. There are many Charlotte/Pineville/Fort Mill/Rock Hill mom-and-pop Italian restaurants and local venues that serve better food at a cheaper price using better ingredients."}
{"text":"Awful service. Our party of 5 waited an inordinate amount of time for our drinks to arrive. The drinks came without straws so we waited another ten minutes for those. Our salad was brought to the table without plates. At this point we're still having a nice time, wanting to be gracious about the situation. The waitress seemed completely unfazed by her mistakes. Lastly, our entrees were \"misheard\" by our waitress so we ended up with half of what we ordered.  The children were served first but it wasn't enough for food for us to share between the 5 of us. The plates were clean by the time the remainder of our order arrived. I lost my appetite from the frustration of the experience. 

We addressed our concerns with management. We told him that our meal was ruined and he replied with \"but how did the food taste?\". Is \"not worth it\" a flavor? We left aggravated and hungry with half of our entrees packed in to-go boxes so we could catch our movie."}
{"text":"This place suck . Went here for New Year's Day with the family . It wasn't even crowded but had to wait over 20 minutes for spaghetti with meatballs . 
When it did arrive there were barely any sauce and the meatballs was dry. On top of that spaghetti with two meatballs cost $30.  Not worth the money ."}
{"text":"We had a party of 12 with a dinner reservation at 7 PM. They sat us down at 7:30. Our food did not come to the table till 9 o'clock and it was 10 o'clock before we left. The service was absolutely terrible and I would not recommend this restaurant. It was brutal!"}
{"text":"After a good body massage me and my other 2 friends went to this place , the whole wall is decorated with variety of pictures :) , this place was so different , you can walk inside kitchen , there is even a booth near kitchen :) 
This restaurant has some art on the other side of the rooms , I will go next time to see them all :) 
We ordered cheese motzerila n garlic break , it was hot crunchy , yummy :) we ordered chicken  Parmesan family size for 3 of us and packed one for our other friend , it yummy de best I ever had , I would personally  prefer this over Olive Garden and magiannos , chicken was crispy , soft and juicy , tomato sauce was so fresh and i think they made from scratch , waitress was very good , she suggested me some cream soda , which was awesome , tables are quite close , which made me feel like family restaurant , I would go here again and again :)"}
{"text":"Being of Italian descent, I know how Italian food should taste. Please don't say Olive Garden and Italian food in the same sentence. It is NOT authentic Italian.

Buca Di Beppo, on the other hand, IS authentic Italian!!  I practically LIVE there it's so good!!

The ambience is awesome and the music is, well....of course....Italian.  Songs sung by the Italian greats such as: Mario Lanza, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and the list goes on.

You won't be disappointed with ANYTHING you order at this place.  TRUST ME!!   :)"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday while visiting Scottsdale. We hadn't been to this restaurant chain before, so we weren't sure what to expect.

Interestingly, they start you off for a walk through the kitchen. There's even a booth in the kitchen (by reservation for you foodies out there!) if you want to watch them cook. 

My husband is Italian, and he enjoyed the meal, so it must be good. We had an appetizer platter with mozzarella sticks, calamari and stuffed mushrooms, and a special gnocchi with pancetta (I'm pescatarian so I had to pick around a bit). The food is delicious and served family style. We had enough food for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"We drove 25 miles from Lake Norman to Pineville to enjoy this restaurant. What a disappointment. We were seated adjacent to the bar area. It was 85° outside and close to that inside. They had a portable air blower sitting on an adjacent table. Luckily a good bottle of wine helped cool us down.

First we ordered the Florentine bread as an appetizer. We paid $15 for four pieces of bread. It was very unimpressive. Maybe the nine dollar garlic bread would have been better. Surely more flavorful.

Next we ordered a Caesar salad. While the salad dressing was tasty, the lettuce was WARM! So disappointing. It must've been sitting on the counter a long time before they brought it to us. We should have sent it back but didn't. By this point we weren't expecting much from the entrées.

My husband ordered the chicken saltimbotta with artichoke hearts and capers in a lemon butter sauce. I had a pasta dish with 4 different types of stuffed pasta. We rated both fine, but nothing special at all. The words acceptable and bland come to mind. Each dish was around $28 and served 2to 3 people so we had plenty to take home. 

By the end of the evening, with a modest $30 bottle of wine, we spent $115 not including the 20% tip. While the food was barely average, the atmosphere is a nice place to take friends coming in from out of town. There isn't an inch of space on the walls that's not covered by old photos and memorabilia from the 40s and 50s. It's very eclectic and interesting. So if you go, don't have great expectations for the food and take friends to share the large portions and the high prices. Next time will simply go to Caruso's in Mooresville instead."}
{"text":"We had a team dinner for soccer here. I scheduled in advance with their banquet coordinator Cynthia. She was fantastic! We did a 3 oclock sitting so we could get the lunch price of $19 per person which includes tax and tip. It was so easy and really inexpensive! There was 34 of us that sat all together. The table was ready and the salad and bread were already at the table when we sat down. We had spaghetti, fettucine alfredo and chicken parm, bread salad and drinks. It was so good, extremely easy for such a large group and we even had left over food. If you are going in a large group or for a team event I highly recommend this Bucas."}
{"text":"The food was great! But we were left alone for too long. It took us a while to order, but then out server Junior kind of disappeared. I finally got his attention to ask for bread, as we were quite hungry. This all happened about 2 minutes before our food arrived. Like I said, the food was really good. But we were hungry, and the simple offer of bread would have been very welcome earlier in our dining experience. But our server pretty much disappeared after taking our order. Just saying that it can be quite mediocre at this place."}
{"text":"Want home style italian? This is the place. Served family style dishes come served for 2 or 4....you can pretty safely double that.  Seated quickly, Jody the waitress, did a great job of settling us in.  

Spot on calmari appetizer, also ordered spicy chicken rigatoni pasta and spaghetti in meat sauce with meatballs. First to reference a couple other reviews...if you order a dish that says spicy....expect spicy. This was delicious.

Servers wear shirts that say meatballs as big as your head...ok....not that big but huge juicy, delicious meatballs came on top of the pasta!

Service was great, ambiance is comfortable, food was delicious. 

Lots of other dishes and desserts offered on the menu....something to please everyone I'd say.

Comfortable,  fast, tasty, great price....recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. A little overpriced even for their portion sizes but you won't leave hungry. Jarrett is the best waiter and always makes the dining experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"After a long hard week that included an almost 2000 mile cross country drive to Phoenix, I was in need of hospitality and comfort food.  I love Bucca's in Minneapolis, and have usually had to wait quite a while for table there, but in Scottsdale I was seated immediately and waited on by a waitress who said she was brand new.  She did a phenomenal job as she was kind, welcoming, friendly and helpful.  Spaghetti with meatballs and order of garlic bread was my choice.  Had enough leftovers for two large meals at home the next 2 days.  While I like the concept of family style eating it has problems for the lone diner, and I wish I would have had the option for normal portion size that came with a salad or veggies instead."}
{"text":"We go to Bucca di Beppo all over Arizona and California and today was one of the worst experiences in Peoria. Our service was extremely slow, we were there for almost 2 hours! There was 6 of us 4 being kids, seemed a bit excessive considering it's family style. The bathroom had a repulsive odor that smelt like the sewer, I feel bad for the tables that were close to the restroom. We always get the celebration cake when we come but we decided to get it to go due to time and the server failed to mention it has changed. It's usually red, white and green but today it was white. Would of been nice to know while ordering it that it was coming out different. I felt like the server wasn't knowledgeable about the new updates. We also ordered for the kids the summer dessert strawberry shortcake, that was terrible! It's was hard disk like biscuits with whip cream and strawberries, not at all what I was expecting! The kids didn't touch it. I even asked if it was good before ordering it. Spent way too much on some disappointing food. I usually enjoy my experience at Bucca but today wasn't a good day."}
{"text":"Did you know they change the menu for lunch?  Cause I didn't and was thoroughly disappointed with the lunch menu selection.  I was looking forward to a big meal and having leftovers  for dinner.  Ordered the chicken and eggplant parmigian (hope I spelled that right) and was soggy due to them not draining the water from the noodles.  Bottom line I wouldn't go back for lunch."}
{"text":"For those of you that don't realize... Buca's is a franchise resturant. I found my first Buca's back home in PA and was pleasently surprised at the food. I am a bit fussy about eating Italian out especially when it comes to red sauce. I like my gravy SMOOTH! Not chunky. My german girlfriend on the other hand loves chunky gravy. The amount of food you get is amazing and a small entree can surely be shared by 2 people so don't let the prices scare you. We ordered chicken carbanara white is in an alfredo style sauce with peas, panchetta bacon, chicken and proschuitto. She got a side of marinara which was some what chunky but not quite as spicey as she likes. But overall the meal was delicious to me even though the bacon was not panchetta. We also had Italian wedding soup which was NOT traditional but was equally delicious! They added roasted red peppers to it to spice it up and it was really good plus the bowl was HUGE! We finished off with an order of tiramisu which was very good also and was enough to feed 5 or 6, it was literally the size of a 8 or 9 inch pie!!! This is pretty good Italian food served just like your grandmother would have done... Enouth to feed a batallion of Marines! Two iced teas, two bowls of soup, one small entree and one dessert... $45.00. Our waitress Suzanna was very nice and did a wonderful job! You won't go wrong here unless your too picky when it comes to your gravy! LOL!"}
{"text":"We went to this Buca last night with 6 others and it took 2 hours and 45 minutes to get out of the place.  The food was good when it finally came, but definitely not worth the wait.  The restaurant didn't look full to capacity, but everything happened in slow motion.  

It was a totally forgettable experience of some of the worst service I have ever experienced.  If I hadn't been with guests that I invited there for dinner, I would have walked out far sooner.  I understand that everyone has a bad night, but everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong.  We waited 45 minutes for someone to take our order.  People that were seated after us, were served before us.  The waiter was not attentive and rarely filled our drinks.  It took forever for the first check, then it was not split as we indicated more than once.  Then it took forever to get to-go boxes.  When the checks finally came back 10 minutes later, they were still incorrect and actually a higher total cost than the first time the check was brought to us.  That is when I decided to just pay it and get out of there finally.  I was not exaggerating when I wrote that we were there for 2 hours and 45 minutes.  It was a very sad display of service.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Your meals could even be fine, but please, stop calling yourself \"authentic.\" Non ho mai mangiato neanche una delle ricette nel vostro menu. Gli italiani non mangiano questi piatti. Fate un bel viaggio in Italia, uno di questi giorni. Semplicemente, descrivetevi come \"Italian-Americans\" e non come autentici."}
{"text":"Lovely place with great decor. The place was slow so we got excellent service and the food was delicious and enough to have for lunch tomorrow we will be back"}
{"text":"Jeff made our quick lunch at the bar a fun experience. He recommended a terrific Italian wine and did not blink when my husband asked which beers are GMO free. He was accommodating and pleasant even when we split one entree three ways. It was a perfect respite from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas. Thank you Jeff."}
{"text":"I have dreams about their chicken carbonara. It's the dish I could eat everyday of my life. They'd have to knock out my walls and carry me on a flatbed truck to get me anywhere, but its fantastic. They don't use bacon, which really makes the difference. 
Their chicken limon is fantastic, so is the caprese salad. Fantastic mozzarella. 

Their bread is always a little hard and stale. Plus, it's family size amounts unless you get a lunch special. 

Most importantly, sign up for their mailing list and like them on Facebook. You get great coupons."}
{"text":"Ashley & Jade are the best!!!

Our large group of 12 ladies had a weekday lunch here and had the pleasure of being helped by JADE! She was so kind, welcoming, and quick to help us divas out for over 4 hours!!

We started with yummy warm bread with dipping oil and balsamic or butter.  For appetizers we tried the bruschetta, Apple & cranberry salad, and Italian chopped salad.  We liked the Italian one a lot!

We also had a lemon caper chicken and 2 pastas (the names in not sure) which were quite yummy!! The lemon caper chicken had a sauce which kept it a nice texture though for me this could have had more flavor.  One pasta had a white sauce and spinach leaves, and the other was line a baked ziti with bubbly mozzarella!! This was my favorite entree item.

For dessert we had cannoli which were not too heavy and the perfect size for one!

We enjoyed our lunch so much that we just stayed and stayed... For 4 hours!!  Jade must have brought me at least 5 new coffees alone!  Always with a fresh cup on a plate with creamer!! Such a nice touch.  

I would recommend this place to others after the lovely service and food we experienced."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I've had authentic Italian and just because it is served as such, does not mean that the quality is that. I was so unimpressed."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times (twice for lunch, once for dinner, and once for a work function)

I'm not a fan of the restaurant.  Food is fine... but very bland.  I've never once specifically thought to myself \"Wow, this is great!\"  The main draw is the restaurant itself.  The walls are COVERED in funny Italian themed pictures and there is plenty of odd and interesting decor.

Lunch service leaves a lot to be desired.  Waiter brought us dinner menus and looked confused when we asked for lunch menus.  The silverware was disgusting one time.  Looked like it was caked in cheese and pasta, run under the faucet once, then just wrapped up in the napkin and put back at a table.  Lunch service is also VERY slow.  Food took forever and they seemed like they were in no-hurry to give us the check... deal breaker for a week day work lunch.

There are so many great restaurants in the Cleveland area so there is no reason to pay for bland & boring food at a cheesy/gimmicky Italian place.  That being said, it is worth a visit once I'd say for the experience... but that'd be about it."}
{"text":"The very first time we visited this resterant and it won't be the last.we had 20 people coming in from all over U.S.A & Canada to surprise my wife's 70th Birthday.The Manager Lorenzo and his staff went out of their way to make sure my wife had no idea that our group were waiting in one of the 8 rooms to hold our function.Now i i want to tell ya The food preperation was Fantastic, the Servers very professional, the price....... Lets say in the future any functions which im sure there will be i plan will be held here and even for a night out to dine i will be back. Thankyou Lorenzo and staff for a very professional job well done"}
{"text":"We have been to this location a couple of times, but  this last one was slightly disappointing. 

The stuffed mushrooms in the creamy pesto was pretty delicious. The warm house bread was good, but the vinegar and oil they provide with it was not proportioned well and was bland. The braised short ribs, though slightly expensive, tasted like cheap pot roast.

The highlight of the evening was ordering the Colossal Sundae, knowing full well what was coming. Our friends were not expecting the sheer size of the dessert, resulting in a very genuine, very hilarious \"WHAT THE..!!\""}
{"text":"The wait staff are really marginal no sense of dedication lack manners and serving skills. Food is expensive for the lack of quality. Bread horrible the loaves of bread that are on display in kitchen as props look  better. Would absolutely not return."}
{"text":"Richard Pro here with another review.

Ordered the lasagna and veal marsala. Don't be misled by the portion sizes. They claim a small can feed 2 people...well it doesn't even come close. I probably could have eaten two of their small lasagnas by myself. As for the small veal marsala, it comes on one normal sized plate with mushrooms and sauce smothered on top. Without any noodles, I can't even imagine how they would expect this dish to serve two people. 

The bread is quite fresh and tasty. My lasagna was slightly overcooked. I like my noodles to be slightly firm with some bite to it, like any good pasta. Instead my lasagna noodles were flabby and dissolved in my mouth. However, like I said, it was only slightly overcooked.

2.5 stars. Would rate higher for bigger portions because the price is exorbitant for what you get."}
{"text":"We had lunch this past Thursday and the food was great! We ordered lunch entrees of lasagna and spicy chicken rigatoni. We both loved the dishes. It was not overcooked, soggy, tasteless, or dry. I am always fearful of soggy noodles and dry chicken. 

We both could barely finish both dishes. Although they were lunch size, it was huge. 

The only minor bad thing is that no one greeted us for a while even though there were servers everywhere. The manager saw us from the kitchen and quickly greeted us and offered us drinks."}
{"text":"This is the worst service we have ever had before. Our server - Paula - was absolutely ridiculous. She took 10 minutes just to take our drink order. Nowhere to be found for most of our dinner and had an excuse to offer every time. All of the food did not come out how we ordered it. The eggplant was so overcooked I couldn't cut it. My advice is to NOT come anywhere near this restaurant. An hour and 30 minutes wasted."}
{"text":"I thought the service was crappy, the food was ok at best, the prices are definitely on the high side. It only took an hour to get our food and another 30 minutes to get more water. Vegas is hot, I need a constant flow of water at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"They had 3 hostess up front doing nothing and didn't even greet us. Booked reservation for 17 and she tried to cram us on 3 tables. We had no space to move elbows. Why would you even try to seat us like that? Reason I book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time. 

When I walk up front ask host if I can get a bigger table. She gave me an attitude. And was like \"sure\". Never got a apology for cramming us into a small table. The place is a family style with big dishes. The way they had us seated we wouldn't been able too move to grab our food. Terrible customer service and it was my birthday. Disappointment. Will never return to the restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been to Bucca at several different locations including the one in Vegas near the Luxor, Huntington Beach and OC. All have been great experiences until now. This time was terrible! From the terrible tap waters to the food--- it was not the quality we have experienced before. We had the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and a Create Your Own Pasta. The Rigatoni was soggy and the create one had pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. I was told I HAD to order a third veggie, and didn't want it. I decided to ask for cooked onions on the side. I was going to give them to my hubby who loves onions. I do not like them in my pasta.

The pasta came with the onions in it. The waiter noticed but didn't take it back to fix it. The pesto had NO flavor and was all just a bunch of oily noodles. I took one bite and was done. The only thing worth eating was garlic bread. 

When the waiter came back to box up our meal, my husband mentioned that I didn't like the pasta, and there was no offer to take it off the bill or any extra piece of customer service. I am a vegetarian, so I wasn't going to eat the Rigatoni. I tried to order just a plate of broccoli and they were out it. 

We overheard the family near us unhappy with their meal as well, and the waiter apologizing as he boxed up their food. 

We paid $100 for tap water and food I wouldn't feed to my dog. When we arrived back at our hotel, I went and bought a slice of pizza just to have something in my stomach. 

If this is how this place runs regularly (it was dead and had maybe 5 families in it) perhaps it should be re-located to a better location. Eek."}
{"text":"We had a fettuccini supremo pasta with garlic bread order for pick up.  We got there and they thought we ordered a pizza (but we ordered through yelp, next time we may call in).
They fixed the order promptly, the bar tender gave an accurate estimate of the time it'd take.  So it was not too much inconvenience.

The pasta and the garlic bread were great, they fixed the mistake promptly.  This location was pretty busy that night, but had some open tables, I wish we had dined in, so next time we will.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"We called in to order food for Christmas Eve. They said that the food will be ready in a couple hours. Mind you we called at 6 and we went to pick is up by 830. We get to the place to pick up our order to find out that our order wasn't put in to their system. Note that we have our family counting on us for our Christmas Eve dinner. When we tried to explain that we had up in the order a couple hrs ahead, the girl who was helping us (Daniella) just told us \"we know, but this is reality, what can you do about it). It blew my mind on the level of unprofessionalism of this place. I've been coming to Buca di Beppo for years and I can tell you they just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Sat in the upstairs area, server had to go up and down to bring us our food and never was asked or got a refill on my coffee.  Then, when we ordered dessert......never asked or brought another cup/refill.  Had to ask and then waited over 10 minutes before getting it.

They do not have coffee in the upper level and don't even let the servers bring/use a carafe for refills.

When you spend almost $70 for lunch.......should be much better service!!!!!

Manager was .......oh, sorry.

Love these restaurants but not this location."}
{"text":"I love the decor of this place. It's walls are filled with Italian themed pictures. As for the food, the spaghetti is good and one serving is enough for 2 persons or maybe even for 3 servings. I also tried the pepperoni pizza and it was awful! Super greasy and the crust was too crunchy borderline hard. The service was not bad, our server was attentive and friendly. Would return but would not eat pizza at this place again."}
{"text":"Visited Buca Di Bepo for my sister's graduation dinner.  We had made a reservation well in advance for a party of 8.  

As soon as we were seated, the server came to us and said the only sauce we can serve you today is Marinara. Yes, Marinara! They were out of any Alfredo sauce.  I couldn't help but joke about how they didn't mention this before seating us.   (If I wanted a marinara sauce pasta - I would rather have it at home!).  About 15 mins later, he came out and had found that they had a secret stash of sauce which they would serve for one small dish - one small dish for 8 people.  We decided we had to compromise for another large dish w marinara sauce.  As soon as he served us dinner, we requested a Kids meal of Chicken Parmesan - only to find out that their kitchen had supposedly closed well before we got our meals - he somehow had forgotten to warn people about the kitchen closing soon.  That's when he said our only option for additional food would be House bread or desert, which we weren't served on being seated.  A few minutes into our meal, he stopped by to wrap things up.  An extremely disappointing experience, the only positive being the tiramisu, which is why we give it a single star than none.

We've love hosting large parties at this particular Buca but our experience at this graduation dinner was extremely disappointing; especially when they call themselves the Home of Graduation parties.  I would have to think before choosing this place for dinner."}
{"text":"The service was good and our server was very friendly but the food was extrememly sub par. Literally zero flavor! You could tell the tomatoes used in the sauce were not ripe and the pasta was overcooked and falling apart. Extremely overpriced for what it is. I added as much parmesan and pepper as possible to try to vamp it up and I basically took two bites before giving up n the dish all together (Penne alla Vodka). My husband ordered a house specialty Spicy shrimp dish and it tasted exactly the same as mine. I can honestly say we will never be going back."}
{"text":"I think this is a great place to go when you have a large number of people but it is expensive. We had chicken parm (very good), fettucine alfredo (very good) and ravioli (good). The waitress was personable but a little too slow to refill glasses, bring wine, etc. 

The room we were in was surprisingly quiet which was nice - we could all hear each other speak! I would go back with a large party - when I save some money!"}
{"text":"nice place to go out with the family, the portions are huge and i love it the sundae dessert for 6, is my kids favorite, and they only are 3 lil ones  tanks bucca"}
{"text":"So just left and let me say the waiter needs to write things down we said half Blanca pizza and tomato sausage and mushroom. Well the pizza comes out and all white sauce o never said all white sauce. We also got a sad excuse of a mixed salad it was like a whole onion in the salad and  the l type of lettuce was iceberg in it 13 bucks for a mixed what shame on them to charge such a price for a salad I could've made a better salad at home and would've actually had a variety of lettuce I will not be going back soon. I can't stress it enough waiters/ waitresses write down your orders."}
{"text":"I had a dream I ate here once. The food and service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby hotel and felt like having Italian.  The name seemed Italian enough and the place looked quite nice so I went inside and ordered some pasta.

There is absolutely nothing Italian about this place. The pasta tasted like something you'd get from a middle school cafeteria. The flavor was bland, it had absolutely NO SEASONING, not even some salt or pepper, nothing, just cooked noodles and crushed tomatoes. 

I would not recommend this place AT ALL, I rather have spaghetti at Denny's than this \"Italian Restaurant\"

Despicable!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and they food was really good!! I had their chicken parmigiana with a side of alfredo fettuccine, my coworker had the chicken carbanaro pasta and that was amazing. The calamari appetizer I was great too!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't review the food because they wouldn't seat us. They close at 10 pm (on the strip in Vegas!) We arrived at 9:40 and were told they were no longer seating for dinner. The hostess was quite rude - her exact words were: \"We already had last call. We close at 10, so we stop seating 15 minutes before that.\" So, not only do they have a ridiculous policy (if you want to close at 9:45, say that), they also have rude staff that can't tell time!"}
{"text":"Place is so, so. The food tasted like something out of a jar. The garlic bread seemed as though they just cut up a bunch of French rolls and threw some mozzarella on top. Plus the floor was filthy. The decor of the place is pretty tacky. The wait staff was attentive but showed zero enthusiasm (beginning to think this is a Las Vegas wide phenomena....tourist burn out and low wages an issue? Expensive in relation to the quality of food and environment."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and shared a salad and pasta with my family. It was completely dead for it being a Saturday afternoon. Our server was never to be found. The bread was cold and the shrimp, tomato, garlic pasta we had was like a soup. The only other table in the restaurant was also complaining how long it took to get their food. Don't understand how you can get bad service and why it would take so long if no one is there!"}
{"text":"Jarrett, was our server he was amazing! He gave us a great introduction about the food and restaurant. Service was amazing and food was also. Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"I love the Shrimp Fradiavolo and Chicken Carbonara. Yumm yumm.. We always come to this location. Last time we ate here, the bread came cold though."}
{"text":"If a more than healthy portion of mediocre Italian food is your thing this is the place to be. The service was excellent even though the overall knowledge of our server was lackluster. Out waiter claimed my tasteless glass of malbec was from Spain. I think not. What's next ... Champagne from Napa phwww"}
{"text":"BUCKET DI SHITO 
If you want authentic Italian food. This place isn't it,  Save your money and go to Olive Garden!!! 

Terrible food, 20 dollars a plate, and staff look like they don't want to work there!!!

Good luck"}
{"text":"This Boca is speedy delicious and sociable I will go here in Desoto was next to perfection we got bread three times and then with hot and fresh all three of the time that's all. Our way there was a band no EV were not true and he was a gentleman and so delightful to eat near him. Another lady brought the pasta out she was the manager she was great although she did severe when another customer sent back is alcoholic beverage overall would highly recommend this book is one of the best movies I've been to in the entire country and I know Boca"}
{"text":"This restraunt has an excelent atmosphere and the restraunt on the inside is very comfy and had a lot of hints of old school, however the food wasn't that amazing and not highly recommendable but you do get big portions."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place.  I heard the food was good and I live near the restaurant.  I actually ordered my meal online for take-out.  The website menu was easy to go through.  Ordering online was simple and smooth.  I figured I would try the baked ziti.  I went to the restaurant to pick up the meal and the people were friendly and attentive.  The ambiance was nice and it smelled fantastic.  I was really looking forward to trying the baked ziti.  I picked up my order and drove home.  When I opened up the bag it had two huge containers and a bag of italian bread.  You get a lot of food for your money.  However, the baked ziti was a complete let down.  Actually the worst pasta I have had in my life.  It looked like they got off to a good start on the dish, they just didn't any sauce to the pasta.  In this huge container of pasta there could only have been 1-2 tablespoons of sauce.  The pasta being baked without sauce was very dry and tasted awful. I just spent $30 on a meal and it's inedible.  These high ratings for this restaurant chain must be for locations other than this one here in Summerlin.  The food court at the mall provides a better meal than this Buca di Beppo location.  If an italian restaurant can't even cook a simple pasta dish, I know I will never go back to try anything else.  Pasta is the simplest meal to make I know.  Boil in water and add sauce.  Simple.  At least they got it half right, they cooked the pasta (which dried out quickly without sauce).  This place was a complete waste of money and time.  That's it...  I have to go to McDonald's now to get something to eat - I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"As always everything was great, we had the Apple Gorgonzola salad, and spicy chicken pasta and chocolate chip cannoli, we had only been to the one at Universal Studios Hollywood but this bucas is just as good, only complaint was the wait time for food was a little long"}
{"text":"It is truly family style meal...very tasty....we had the Dan Reno and the chicken parmigiana... With cheese bread....oh my! Very delicious...it was happy hour...the peach Bellini and Italian margarita were exceptional. Great service at the bar."}
{"text":"Thank god for their good service occasionally or this place would be a total flop. Sorry I said it. What keeps me coming back is convenience (its less then a miles from my house) and their $10 off $20 purchase coupons that are always around!

The food is okay. About the same as something I could whip up in my kitchen...okay maybe a step up. The service has always been iffy (either wonderful or terrible) and sometimes it takes awhile to get your food. Small thing that peeved me: every glass of soda/icedt they bring you they add $3 to your bill...kinda cheesy but whatever. 

 Overall yeh I will go back for some overpriced food in a handy to-go \"tub\"."}
{"text":"I dine at different Buca locations across the country. I am in love with the food and the service is normally great. With that said, stay away from this location. The service is terrible and the place is a mess. This is not a one time experience. I would still recommend Buca at any other location, but this one is a black eye to the chain. 

Buca management. If you read this, you need to clean house at this location."}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful experience at Buca di Beppo (Excalibur) in Vegas! Our volleyball team of 20 enjoyed a delicious meal after a hard working day on court. Mandy was instrumental in getting us a table for a large party at late notice, and our server Randi was amazing! When we arrived, there was already bread and salad on the table and the food arrived soon after.  The players and the parents on the team were very happy with the dinner! Buca even made it special by celebrating 2 of the players' birthdays! Thank you Buca for a wonderful team dinner!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. When we arrived the hostess didn't even greet us or smile. We waited about 20 min to be seated on a Thursday night (not awful) but the restaurant was not busy. It was our first time eating here and the server did little to give us recommendations. She was polite but certainly not personable or welcoming. The booth was dirty (I had to wipe food off my seat) and our table was unsteady and would move every time it was touched as if the whole thing was going to collapse or tip. Our dirty dishes from our appetizer weren't cleared when our server came back to the table multiple times and I finally had to get up and clear our dishes myself so they were out of the way. The ONLY reason I am giving a star is because the food was decent. But $120 for a meal for 5 (two of them small children)...definitely not worth it. You'd have a better experience at Olive Garden. I was very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came back to give it another chance and overall was much better. Food was good but order got mixed up. The waiter took care of it very quick and was very sorry. After the first time thereand having a bad time things changed. Will be back"}
{"text":"We originally headed to Olive Garden for lunch while visiting the Charlotte, NC area. After finding that Olive Garden uses latex gloves during food preparation, we had to change our plans due to a latex allergy one our family members have. We called Buca and were assured they were latex free. 

What a great experience we had. From the friendly staff to the perfectly prepared food. Although not widely publicized, Olive Gardens food is \"heat and eat\", meaning your chef uses a microwave oven. Buca food was freshly prepared, served hot and cooked perfectly! The prices were inline with competitor chain prices but the quality was miles ahead. 

The restaurant was clean and decorated in that vintage style Italian home feel.  Being a Brooklyn born Italian, I have been in many Italian houses and trust me, they have the décor correct.

This is not meant to beat up Olive Garden, or compare Buca to a family owned Bensonhurst or Bay Ridge Brooklyn Italian restaurant, but to give heads up for meal options when traveling.

I normally would not rave about a chain restaurant, but this location deserves to be recognized."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and always enjoyed the food. Our recent visit there was very disappointing. The food was terrible and quite frankly,  the restaurant  was very dirty. So sad to see this place go so far down hill."}
{"text":"Its sad to see any restaurant get bad reviews but when we went, we did have to wait a bit to be seated but it was well worth the wait. The waitress was run off her feet. She was the only one there that had to be the bartender the waitress and the busser. Incredible! We ordered the Fruitti de Mer (seafood in pasta) and the Spaghetti with meat sauce. OMFG! First off the portions were generous. We got two large. And we demolished the seafood BOWL!. The spaghetti was so delicious. I have never had pasta that good before except for Anton's pasta. I'll tell you about that in another review. The sauce was exceptional. Its too bad management doesn't know diddly about staffing the restaurant properly. The food is so good I would go back regardless if I had to deal with the wait."}
{"text":"For a chain Italian place Buca isn't bad. Service is good, even when they are booked, food is pretty consistent as far as quality goes. 

It probably won't make you say Mamma Mia! in excitement, but it will fill you and your families tummy for a price that might. ;)

A family of four could easily eat here for $50 (tip included) if you have one of the $10 off coupons that they send out monthly."}
{"text":"Should i begin by saying this place needs a hostess! Yes is 8:30pm and there wasn't a hostess some tall guy in a dress shirt gave me the menu,i did asked for it because i was placing a to go order,ok after few mins of going thru the menu i was ready to place my order.no hostess nor the the guy that welcomed me at first ok i finally saw a server and said to me and to another costumers to go to the bar if we wanted to order to go.we get to the bar and the bartender or server (since she was wearing same color shirt as the rest) asked first for ID's my self & and the other guests asked why and said in order to seat at bar section need to show ID first however we could seat at the tables right next to the bar,the other couple decided to seat at table but change their mind and walked away(am sure just like me weren't happy about the warmth welcome,finally I decided to seat at the table and order.i explained out to her that i had already waited 5mins seating for someone to help me but she seem like didn't care. Food was great,i hope on a future visit to see a more friendly staff and feel more comfortable with my visit."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a birthday dinner (for 4) - have not been to Bucca in quite a long time.  The portions for 4 people are huge! The food was delicious (antipasto salad, garlic bread, baked ziti, chicken parmesan and tiramisu). The service was great, no complaints."}
{"text":"My family had made reservations for 5:00 on Wednesday right after Hamilton High School's 2017 Graduation. I had to call and request to change the reservation time to 5:30 and ( I want to say her name was Debra ) was quite happy and unbothered to make the change! 
Granted it was only a thirty minute difference, but people give attitude for a lot less!
My brother and I saved the table for our entire group, and our waiter Kyle got all the seats water, and lots of starter plates for the house bread and salad.
My brother noticed that the wood that was at the top of his seat still had wood cleaner/polish/stain on it, and it was coming off at the touch, or was sticky and tacky feeling.
When my family arrived, we addressed it with Kyle who was severely apologetic, and offered to help us switch tables, which we didn't think necessary, we just asked for some rags or for some napkins to wipe it off ourselves.
Kyle brought back some towel and climbed into the booth behind us, and started scrubbing down the wood himself. It was very kind, as we just wanted to at least take it off the areas where clothing or whatever else would bump into it.
Kyle was a very attentive waiter, and very accommodating, also clearing any empty plates, offering refills, knowing the menu and portion sizes very well. 
During the middle to end of our meal, a gentleman walked up to our table and addressed himself as the Manager of the restaurant . His name is Rick Yumanovich, and he was absolutely wonderful. Extended his apologies for the stain on the wood, and gave us his personal business card in case any of our clothes were affected because of the stain. We assured him that it was no big deal, and there was no harm done and no hurt feelings.
When we were wrapping up and receiving to go boxes for the DELICIOUS food that was provided, Kyle asked if we wanted to get dessert or not, and based off the portions and many breads and salads we said no.
He walked away and came back and said that the Manager would absolutely not take no for an answer, and was going to give us the Dolce Platter free of charge for the inconvenience of the wood stain.
This location knows customer service. They treated us so kindly for something that we honestly did not even find to be a big deal at all!
I am not a huge fan of italian food myself, but I would come back to support such a great business with wonderful management that care about their customers!"}
{"text":"Go to Olive Garden if you're hungry for Italian food. They're much cheaper, too. I'm just not impressed with this place, taste wise, price wise, experience wise. I could say a lot more but i don't want this review to be me complaining for paragraphs. 
I do know people who love the food here but you'll pay almost double for what you could get at Olive Garden.
Maybe I just haven't visited the right locations but after so many bad experiences mainly with the taste of my food I'd rather not return."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Buca di Beppo out in Arrowhead, but my friend who had never been there, decided that is where we would celebrate her birthday.  We arrived about 1:30 p.m. on a Saturday and the restaurant was fairly dead.  Our hostess sat us in the bar that was virtually deserted, so we requested the upstairs restaurant.  Upstairs was a \"slog\", but we arrived and were seated, joining a couple who was just leaving.  

We ordered wine and a plate for two--shrimp, spinach, pasta dish--and eventually got it.  The food was \"watery\", as if they had not properly drained the pasta,  the food had no taste, and it had an \"unfresh\" smell.  The poured wine by the glass was \"stingy\" for the cost.  The whole meal was lacking flavor and a paucity of presentation for that simple fare.  For the prices, I expected much more.

That was and will continue to be my only experience at this restaurant.  The waiter was nice enough, however."}
{"text":"I had a good experience coming to this Buca di Beppo. The food is pretty good and typical of an Italian chain. You absolutely have to love the giant portions (high price but you get what you pay for). I ordered the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni by recommendation of the server and it was delicious. Not something I would usually order so it was a great surprise."}
{"text":"Just left there after trying this place for the 1st time. Our server Tim recommended his favorite dish the Baked Rigatoni. Wen waited 29 minutes (timed it) just to get a very dry (no sauce) overcooked dish. We tried it and left the rest. Tim was not people friendly. We had to get his attention a few times to come attend to us. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I loved the idea of family style eating . I was a little skeptical about the flavors and food in general, since family style means just cheesy . But boy was I wrong !
Amazing ravioli and  an equally brilliant spaghetti with vegetables. To top it off we were served with a big smile ."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here if you are looking for gluten free. I told our server my allergy (well celiacs) and he told me he would make sure they knew in the kitchen. A little later he came out and told us that he forgot that they were out of the mashed potatoes but they did have rosemary potatoes. I told him those weren't on the gluten free menu as an option, but he checked with the kitchen and they said they could do them gluten free so we agreed. Well, the meal came out and we were enjoying it until I took a \"crunchy\" bite of something. If you're gluten free you would appreciate the terror I had with that bite...I immediately spit it out and looked closer at the potatoes and saw a number of \"crunchy bits\". My husband investigated and realized it was breading from something. I was horrified! We spoke with the manager and he was very rude. First he told me there was not breading on the potatoes and I showed it to him and he said it was from the calamari that is also cooked in the fryer (cross-contamination in a common fryer is a huge no-no for gluten free). He further explained that nothing says their food is  gluten free (despite the gluten free menu and waiter).  After I explained that I would get very ill by what they did, he asked if he needed to call me an ambulance or if I had my epi pen with me. Seriously, dude, how are you the mgr of a major restaurant chain and be so clueless about celiacs and gluten intolerances?!? Please, please, please do NOT eat here if you need the gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo Restaurant in station square is pretty good. I've been there 3 times now and I think it's gotten better each time I've gone there. First off, the place is cute and very Italian looking and decorated lol. There's a lot of seating and every time I've gone, I don't believe we had to wait. We've gone for my birthday about three years ago and I think that was the best experience. We had one of the rooms upstairs to ourselves. The food is served family style so whatever you order, it gets shared. It can get a little pricey. Overall, I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came here for my Grandmother's 90th birthday celebration,  the first thing I have to say is how impressed I was with our server, Jordyn. We had a party of 22, alot of us were from out of town and filled in at different times, but that made no difference to her, she was happy to help and went above and beyond for everything. She kept a smile the whole time and was more than pleasant. She handled our party with ease despite being 22 guests. 
The food was great, and the ambiance perfect. We had an amazing time and enjoyed celebrating our milestone here. 
Again, thank you Jordyn for making the night fabulous."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  First the stuffed shells they brought my friend and I were filled with a runny filling which resembled baby food.,we were both disgusted. Sent it back after two bites, and the portion (a large) is supposedly supposed to feed 4-6 \"people\", maybe those people come from lollipop land because it's small for $30 (maybe ten shells)... So we got the chicken parmisian instead. 6 peices of thin chicken breast for $30, no pasta with it... It was OK. Not great. Then when I commented negatively to the manager on our bill being $66 , after I had taken two bites of the shells, and half of a single chicken breast -- she was extremely rude, and condisending. I won't be back. Ever. This place is owned by planet Hollywood too, so if u like corporate dog food which you'll pay too much for, then go for it."}
{"text":"Having a wedding party here with 23 people. Great service and food. Had the cheese manicotti, chicken parm and spaghetti. Plus salad and deserts. All excellent. Would come back again any time."}
{"text":"The kitchen table for kids is the bomb. I loved it.

Good food. Humongous servings and good taste. A little pricey, if you ask my opinion.

Spaghetti with meatballs and penne with added shrimp, really good.

Rosemary side potatoes could be skipped.

Colossal brownie Sunday, well, colossal and delish.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Well, unfortunately this place didn't even come close to meeting anyone's expectations. If you are going to charge an arm and a leg for dinner, at least make it worth it! We started with fried mozzarella, garlic bread and Caesar salad (small size in everything). The mozzarella was ok and so was the Caesar. We also ordered the lasagna, fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and baked ziti.  All of the food was overly garlicky. As my husband mentioned, we could have killed a vampire if we burped...
The bread sucked and was overly toasted, the fettuccine was so dry that we had to request 2 additional bowls of sauce which we got charged for, the ziti was dry but, by that time, we didn't even care anymore. The only thing that was semi tasty was the lasagna. At least it wasn't dry...
Total came to over $150 for everything. And, they charge for everything...like $10 for the chicken in the fettuccini ... Pick another place for Italian.  Actually pick another place for dinner...period. Will not return.

Thanks for the service Jenny. You're probably better off going back to working at chili's...sorry :-/"}
{"text":"We have come here several times and been pleased, I've even left positive reviews here.  But today that's not the case.  Our server was very inattentive and slow, even tho she only had 3 tables.  We had to ask for things like refills or sugar for tea three and four times.  Then our bill was .06 cents short for the $40 total required for our coupon and they wouldn't accept it or give us any alternative (like add something very small to our total to push it over $40).  I'm sure we'll try it one more time but cautiously ... hope this was just a fluke and not a new normal."}

{"text":"I'm sure there are restaurants with layouts more confusing and cramped but I haven't found many. Let me say the food was good and the servers friendly. But the Arctic air blowing from the damaged vent in the ceiling, too small table, rickety chairs, elevator not functioning and the only restrooms both being cleaned simultaneously was somewhat off putting. The servers were forced to trudge up the stairs to the 2nd floor carrying large trays while the pregnant girl in our group struggled up the same stairway was not conducive to a favorable review. Bada-boom-bada-bing, 2 stars."}

{"text":"Well. I'll just get right to the point. This atmosphere is fun, the wait staff is very friendly, and care to answer questions. The food on the other hand, it isn't worth what it costs. 

The pictures on the wall are fun to look at. Some of which you can see the story behind it. 

All in all, fun place.. but.. lacks the taste in the food."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. I give it 2 stars because our food tasted ok, but it should be one star for how horrible the incident unfolded. 1st of all, we were told 20 minutes and it ended up being 30 for the table. Then the waiter took over 5 minutes to even acknowledge we are there, and then walked up to us asking if we're ready to order. No greeting, no drink, no appetizer. We were then not given the bread basket, either. Then after we order, they burnt our 4 year olds pizza, and forgot to tell us. So it took forever to get a new  one, and by then we were done eating. They took about 33% off the bill but what a crappy dining experience. This place is clearly in business due to its high foot traffic location, not quality. And btw, my 4 y.o. is still hungry."}
{"text":"Haha at Buca. 

Yeah, you have an array of typical dishes to choose from, but considering these are quite, SIMPLE, Buca still cannot master them. 

Thought the chopped salad would be awesome...but, I should have 
known, they used machetes to chop this dish, and then served us the bottom of the bulk, which means, sweaty, liquefied salad. Also, I don't mind having to order a 'side' of pasta, but I'm just so flummoxed by the choices: spaghetti with marinara? or fettucine alfredo?...choices, choices, choices! I mean, these two just pair so well with the porchetta rustica :(sarcasm): 
Apple crostata= standard apple pie. No warm apples, flaky crust, as falsely advertised on the menu. 

I should have learned from my first experience here. 

Good as a soup line!"}
{"text":"Terrible...1.  no cars in the lot at 5:45 pm. 2.  Got to the front door and it's still locked. An employee came and opened it. Got seated and request a gluten free menu. Finally came and asked the waiter Curtis to find out what would be the safest option. He could not understand what my wife asked so I clearly repeated the question. The last thing that happened was they wanted to card us for a glass of wine when I am 67 years old! At that point four red flags and we left. Buca you got significant problems when this kind of stuff happens. Went down the street to PF Chang's for a much better experience.

They requested my contact info which I supplies. Just like the terrible restaurant visit there customer service follow up is terrible as well. It's  been over a week and I've heard nothing."}
{"text":"We had a 5:30 reservation for 7 people on Mother's Day. Some of us arrived at 5:15 and checked in with the hostess. She stated \"we are just wiping off the table, we will seat you soon.\"  The rest of our party arrived at 5:28 and also checked in with the hostess, who rudely stated \"Your party already checked in, we are wiping off the table and will seat you in a minute\".  (It takes 10 minutes to wipe off a table??)  We waited 10 MORE minutes and asked one of the hostesses what was taking so long, we are now 10 minutes past our reservation time and bunches of other groups were being seated while we waited, including a party of 10. She rudely states - when she was only about 3 feet away from the hostess stand \"I'm not the lead hostess today, you will have to ask her\" and pointed to the other gal at the podium.  WHAT?  It isn't your job to turn around, walk 3 feet and check for us????  WOW. So we again ask the 'lead' hostess who is still just as rude telling us the same damn thing about wiping off the table.  Does she think we are stupid?  FINALLY we get seated 20 minutes after our reservation time.  Our waiter was very nice, however was either clearly taking care of too many tables or was just forgetful.  We started with drink orders, my mom wanted decaf coffee. They are out.  WHAT? You are out of decaf coffee on the day where every mom is out to eat?  Then a couple in our party orders wine.  The wine doesn't come until we ask about it more than 20 minutes later after the appetizers were delivered.   We also wanted the fried mozzarella appetizer, again they are out - forcing us to order something we didn't want. So our entree's come and they forgot one entree saying it will \"be right out\".  It comes about 8 minutes later - clearly just had been made because it was a pizza and not thoroughly cooked but edible.  Most of our table mates were halfway done with their entree's and we were just getting ours.  Needless to say it was an extremely disappointing Mother's Day dinner.  One nice thing that happened was our waiter did spilt our bill into 3 checks and did that perfectly. Additionally, the 40 minutes we were sitting in the lobby waiting for our table - there were 5 hostesses on duty. All 5 of them just stood there at the podium and chatted when they were not walking a party to a table - there were at least 3 of them standing there the entire 40 minutes doing nothing!  There was obvious garbage on the floor in the lobby (gum wrappers, leaves, etc.) and the front door was completely covered in fingerprints. You would think they may have looked around and did some work or at least, at the VERY least interacted with the customers who were waiting. Not one of them said \"Happy Mother's Day\" or \"How are you\" type comments. We will not return."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding reception for 29 people at Buca and we are SO happy with our choice.  The process was seamless from when I contacted them although through to the end our meal.  They were extremely accommodating and took care of all of our needs.    We went with the Bravissimo package and every item we choose was spectacular.  We had way to much food, but we didn't  want to miss out on any of the items we picked.  Some of our favorites were the calamari, apple gorgonzola salad, cheese manicotti, chicken parmigiana, broccoli romano, cheesecake, and cannoli...and that's only part of what we ordered!!  Plus, it was reasonable with the open bar package we selected, we can still afford a honeymoon:)

A special thank you to Denise (event coordinator) and our servers Kurt and Sherae.  Thank you for making our day SO special!"}
{"text":"I don't remember the pasta being so bland. We came here to celebrate my little brothers birthday so there were 20 of us. They do have enough room for large groups, however the service was sooooo slow still with two servers. We also made a reservation so they were aware of the large group. Our drinks were empty for so long and we had to keep reminding our server to refill our drinks. We got the mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and that was pretty good. For our meal we ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni and it had a nice spice to it. And it was pretty good, however I still had to put a lot of salt and pepper on it to make it more flavorful. My mom ordered fettuccine alfredo and it was disgusting. It had no flavor and we had to put so much salt, pepper, and Parmesan on it just to make it taste decent. 
TMI...she also had the runs immediately after eating this. The pasta is just very bland and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Pros: Large portions and good value, the wait staff was very nice and fast

Cons: Not great food that upset my stomach, long wait for our table despite a reservation, kind of a small parking lot 

Details: First I will note this was not my first Bucca experience and the food is pretty much the same at all locations. It is better than say something like Olive Garden,  but I still have her better and more authentic Italian food. We went for a family birthday with a large group and had reservations at 7. We got there on time and the hostess said the group sitting at our table was about to leave.  So we waited, and waited. We did not end up getting to our table until almost an hour later. I realize it is kind of awkward for the staff but that is a pretty big delay and it was not packed. The Manager comped our apatiser orders (two I think) so that kind of made up for it. Our waiter was super patient and helpful and the staff came out to sing happy birthday. But something did not sit well in what I ate and I had pretty bad stomach issues that kept me up and going to the bathroom. So that is why I had to give it a three. But again, the staff was great other than not getting us seated in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Unremarkable food and poor service. The hostess was busy on her \"device\" for maybe 10 minutes before acknowledging our group of five. This was early evening on a weekday with no other people waiting and plenty of open tables. After being seated upstairs our server was slow to take our orders, hard to find to get drink refills and seemed lost. We paid with a gift card which wasn't returned to us, still had ten bucks or more left on it. Wound up chasing down the server to retrieve the card. I don't know why because we won't be back..."}
{"text":"Was brought to buca with some friends and it was my first time ever. The waitress whom I believe was named charlie, was very informative with the menu and with all the answer to my many questions. There was some birthday celebrations happening while we were there. The birthday song, which is a very odd but cool song and the enthusiasm from the staff made it a fun and upbeat atmosphere. Our waitress advised us to go with smalls instead of large entrees so that we wouldn't leave with as she stated \"a duffle bag of leftovers\" she could have received a larger tip with a higher check but instead had our best interest in mind and I appreciated her honesty.. the food was great so overall I would recommend buca to everyone, especially to celebrate a birthday!"}
{"text":"Wow, I was excited to go.. I was told about this place by a freind. So I decided to go with my Family. So it started with an ok, then a blah to ZZzzZZ . Nice place , but the people what's the deal here. If they don't want to work there leave !!  About the food it was not as I heard, pasta looked nice, but the flavor , oh yeah no flavor. Only the garlic butter on my bread. SO we ate and try to enjoy the best of it. Oh the tour, ha ha tha was a joke , the cooks scrambling kinda upset look an their faces, I told my wife \" I hope the service is not  the same\". 


Now, the second time we went I tried to be positive... this time I went into their web site to Reserve a table at a certain time....Oh Boy !!! why did I do that.... we got there at 5:30 put me at hold for 45 minutes not even full that night. After waiting , they sat us down for another 15 minutes..by that time we were starving.. the wiater took our order then another 45 minutes for our food to be ready it was .... Jimminie Crickets what is going on hereee !!!  we sat there waiting lookin at other people bieng served after we got there.. by that time I was fuming... Never Ever again stepping on a Bucca Joint . I'm sticking with SPAGHETTI FACTORY ....  Arrivederci Bucca....."}
{"text":"I always appreciate a restaurant that tries to accommodate a food allergy. This place was very accommodating ! ! ! Our server was Patrick. He was great, very outgoing and friendly. Our food was delicious. Yes, it is a little pricy, but the portions are huge. It is the perfect place for the two of you to go out for an early dinner, and then bring home the leftovers to the little Munchkins. You get time together, and they get a hot delicious dinner, too. We love it."}
{"text":"They advertise as being authentic Italian and family style. They didn't serve bread to the table. Any true Italian meal comes with bread. 

 I ordered a small pizza for 2. My wife and I left the restaurant very hungry. It's wasn't cheap either. $14 for the equivalent of about 2 slices of pizza. I mean we each had the equivalent of 1 thin slice. It's wasn't even great pizza. I can order from any local place and get tons more food for less. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The salad was good, minestrone soup ok, but we ordered a large pizza was nothing more than a flat cheese bread. Could not eat it they never offered a replacement. Paid asked for to go box was given a small container told to stack them. Not worth it. 

I am adding new facts. The GM, David contacted me and explained about the Sicilian pizza style that they serve. Now I understand their receipts. He also stated that he corrected the to go mistake by server. So we tried it again last night a d got much better treatment. Huge portions."}
{"text":"Good meatballs and spaghetti, large portions a small will feed 4 ppl. Good prices and nice atmosphere, worth a stop while in the Excalibur Casino."}
{"text":"I thought I was lucky to get a reservation on Mother's Day for 10 people.
There was a reason.
The food was 75% inedible. Charcoal brussel sprouts. Brocoli so salty it burned our mouths. Unseasoned meatballs. Barely any sauce on the spaghetti. Calamari was soggy. Fried cheese was mostly bread.
Chicken was somewhat edible. Salad passable. Or maybe it tastes better if you are starving after an hour of waiting.
Tiramisu- how can you totally destroy tiramisu? But it was cardboard and coffee.
We froze the entire time despite them saying they adjusted it. One table LITERALY got blankets from their car and ate wrapped in them.
The staff was attentive and friendly.

I feel stupid for paying $31 per person for this meal. I only hope my words will save at least one other family."}
{"text":"Won't be going back.  Smelled like dirty rags had been used to clean the table.  Many of our plates and cutlery were actually dirty..with food stuck on them...gross.  The food was plentiful but tasteless.  The cost was too much for what we got."}
{"text":"I'd have to start out by saying that I didn't expect much. An Italian restaurant in a mall...not much to look forward too. However, my family and I were pleasantly surprised. We started out by meeting our waitress, who despite being very sweet, constantly sounded very aggressive whilst asking us for our orders. \"Would you like a glass of water with that? I said, WOULD YOU LIKE A GLASS OF WATER?!\" Not only were we one placement may short, we had to repeatedly ask for silverware. I proceeded to order a Shirley temple, my classic go-to when I'm trying to lose weight. But alas, the sweet concoction came without a cherry. I tried to move past that, but I have to admit the rest of my meal was quite scarred from the experience. 

Onto the food. One should we warned that if one would like one's own meal, this is not the place to go. Almost everything is served family style. The six of us decided to order the Caprese Salad, Spicy Chicken Rigatoni, Baked Ziti, and Eggplant Parmesan. the Caprese salad was the most cleanly cut mozzarella I have ever seen. Bravo. As for the pasta, I cannot complain, however the seasonings could have been a bit more present. 

One of the most dissapointing parts of the meal was when we were given the check with no dessert menu. I didn't order the Shirley temple for nothing, sweet pea. I cannot complain, but next time, I could've used a cherry."}
{"text":"This is probably the WORST service I have ever received at a restaurant in general. This was my first time here, and I was really excited to try it out. Our server was very inattentive, and was only concerned about the big group next to us. No refills were offered, and we weren't checked on at all. The food was great, and it's a shame the service wasn't on the same level of the food."}
{"text":"Food was alright, but it doesn't seem like a restaurant should force its patrons to out of the restaurant and down the long corridor of shops and other restaurants to get to the nearest restroom. Paying guests should have a closer option inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay well food was good. The wait was not long at all for seating and getting drinks and good but sadly dont know the waiters name. Barely stoppes by twice i just know it was some guy and he didnt even check to see how the food was or offer desert (thankfully we didnt want any). Wasn't super happy with it all in the end. But the garlic bread is awesome"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible! It's been a few years since I have been here to Flamingo location, usually have been to the Excalibur location. Wednesday night took family here it was an 85th B-day and had a sad experience. The service did not start out right even though we had reservations we had to wait for our table in an empty restaurant. The service was slow in getting things out to our table, drinks, bread came there was very little had to ask for plates and oil/ vinegar, appetizer was dry no balsamic or oil for the caprese and it was removed before we finished it, wasn't asked if we wanted it to go. We had to remind our server about salad that did not show up with the appetizer. Our entrees, ravioli some cold in the middle, baked Ziti and Fettucini was bland and soggy. The chicken Parmesan (no cheese) was ok. More bread was requested a large order came out after our entrees were served. The server was not very attentive, maybe she was spread to thin with other tableIs. It was not a very good experience and did not want to make issues while the elders were there, but the elders did speak up sharing there disappointment on the way home which lead me to this review. Also called, no mgr was available, but Chef Doug took the call shared the experience with him, and would have the GM contact me. No calls were returned. I don't think this establishment cares. What was 2 star in now a 1 star rating."}
{"text":"Flew into town to visit family and found this place in Excalibur while walking on the strip. Food was amazing especially the chicken Marsala! Service was amazing as well and will definitely come to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Came in post Cardinals game, looking for dessert & we found it!! Colossal Brownie Sundae! Perfect on an evening when the temp was still reading 110 degrees at 10 pm!! Jarrett was an excellent server even though we were just having dessert.
Very fun restaurant and enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was a going away dinner and our friends wanted to having their party here.  It was my first experience at Buca and I wasn't too impressed. Several of us called ahead to place orders to help assist the kitchen from falling behind.  I am glad we did because those who didn't seemed to have to wait a while for their orders to be taken. Other than that, knowing they were going to have a large party you would hope they would have planned ahead.  We had 1 main server and 1-2 others helping him when they seemed to have a minute.  I would have thought they would have planned ahead to have 2-3 people for such a large group. Our poor server tried but he just seemed miserable the entire time. Yes, it was loud and chaotic due to having a large group of children running around but the kids were going crazy after waiting over a hour for food.  As for drink refills they were no existent.  I had asked 2 times before my water was refilled..and those extra napkins never showed either.  
The food itself was just okay.  Nothing that made me say wow I have to have this again.  Would I eat here again, maybe.  Would I select this place or recommend as a must try...no."}
{"text":"Food is average but pricey. Been before, this time asked for a quiet table then a kid who kept scrwaming, kicking seat and running  around was seated  behind us. Birthday,  can't  use free sundae coupon with 20% off, they will sing to you, but no free dessert,  soooo not birthday  worthy!!!"}
{"text":"I  have been to many locations in various states, it used to be a favorite  restaurant  but this is the last visit. It has changed  since being sold and in my opinion, not for the better!

The garlic bread was a half of a round loaf with slices of garlic on it cut into wedges, now it is just slices of bread with garlic  butter.

Our evening started off fine, we sat in the bar in hopes of watching  the Cardinals  game, it wasn't  on but we asked a manager  and he changed it.

Our server, Helena was attentive, but a bit too familiar, calling everyone Loves, Honey etc I feel this is unprofessional  and it is uncomfortable. She wss  bringing our carafe of red sangria which was full of ice, too sour from the citrus and knowing  how much I can drink and feel it-1 glass of wine, i assume it was not much alcohol! We had 2 cups of minestrone and the packages of saltiness stunk horribly! We gave them to the server, she never brought more!

The two managers, bartenders and some servers decided to loudly argue about shifts and performance  in the bar, in front of everyone  at this time! Very unprofessional! 

We were still eating  our soup, which was hot but average, when the pepperoni pizza and baked rigatoni arrived. The pizza was very greasy. The rigatoni could have had more cheese and sausage for the price!!

At this point we were eating,  a couple tables got up and left, including the one next to us who ordered a salad and green beans only,  then complained that their salad was too small to be a large and they would only pay for a small, so the manager fawned all over them! Helena  was AWOL!  The bartender was sloping buckets of water from the mop bucket onto the floor with the  sanibucket, a bit nasty!  We stopped eating  and still no Helena,  a minimum of 15 minutes, I think more, we were done, needing our food wrapped and our check! She seemed to be very grumpy, maybe the manager  yelled  at her about the salad!  She took the pizza to wtap, didn't  come back, didn't  come back... we were going to get dessert  but decided not to! She finally  came back, packaged  the rigatoni and brought the check.

Neither manager EVER said Hello, mentioned the horrible,  stinky crackers, etc! As we left, the bartender seemed frustrated.. I think the earlier conversation  and whatever went on in the kitchen  rolled over into the dining room, spoiling our experience, which is very bad management! 

The food is not as good as it used to be and with the change in the garlic bread and getting rid of the Sambuca chocolate  sauce, there is no reason  to go back!"}
{"text":"Don't pay via credit card...  Server stole our card number and started purchasing face cream from Nerium International after we ate at this restaurant.  Having to cancel our credit card kind of ruined the meal. The day before Mother's Day, no less!  Somebody's Mom did a really bad job of raising a decent human being."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Buca's for over 5 years now. My main complaint for my visit yesterday was that Buca actually charges $10 for the \"side\" of green beans that is ridiculously small in portion size. See the actual picture when it was served. Will never order any \"side\" dish because of this experience."}
{"text":"Place is always freezing and horrible service. Many other good eateries in same general area."}
{"text":"This was a huge Disappointment. It was my birthday and I was going out with my husband and another couple of friends. We had reservations at 7:15 and we were seated promptly. However, that was the best part of the whole dinner experience. We had to wait to get our drink order. We had to wait to get our drinks. We had ask for silverware. We waited an hour 45 minutes before we even got our food. The manager knew we were upset and comped our salad. She explained that they were shortstaffed in the kitchen and that's why It was taking so long. When we were done eating, we had to wait even more for check. It was only when we got up to walk out that the waiter came running over with our checks. The food was OK. I will never go back here and I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Take out orders a joke.  Ruined V-day dinner.  Check your order before walking out and be prepared to wait even if promised at a certain time.  Spoke with Mike the GM and he was nice but it was too late as 8 drove 40 miles each way to get this food.  I will never spend personal or corporate money again at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Friday night was our first time back to the restaurant in awhile. The hostess was warm and friendly and greeted us with a great smile! We were taken on a tour through the kitchen, which hasn't been extended to us in the past. The food was good, the staff was attentive. The Manager, Dustin, stopped by the table to check on us. He was professional and friendly, we thought he was great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have went 3 times since review for take out. All 3 were great. Requested extra sauce and was explained it would cost more on the chicken Marcella since I had mushrooms in it. I asked if I could have extra sauce without the extra mushrooms and was told yes at no charge. Also no charge for the extra alfredo sauce. All I want are options and not be nickeled and dimed on every item. Food has been 5 star and has the customer service.  The hostess every time has been so sweet."}
{"text":"I'm doing it. I'm going for the five. I can't believe I'm saying this of a chain, but I would recommend this place for a group dinner easily. I could find nothing wrong with our visit here and I wouldn't hesitate to come back. The only circumstantial hinge is that I really think it is better as a large group setting/restaurant. 

We came as a large group...well...it wasn't so simple. We came as four people that were POTENTIALLY to be joined by 2-8 more people. I really give the staff that we dealt with a lot of credit because we were confusing with a capital C that night. 

We opted to sit at the bar after putting a reservation in for a tentative party of 10 people. (Tentative meaning we were having communication issues and I didn't plan the shindig, otherwise, the whip would have been cracking and decisions would have been made. ;) )The bartenders were quite the dynamic duo, messing with each other and giving us an equally friendly and welcomed hard time. They were incredibly accommodating, seeing as we sat down, got our beers, took a sip and were quickly met with the rest of our unplanned group. We only got a short time with them, but those bartenders were great. We even got some bread and dipping oil while we had a short wait. This was important because I was starving and lacking faith in the swift arrival of the rest of our group. 

When we were joined and sat down in the dining area, we ended up at a booth and a table, which worked out for us pretty well. Our server was incredibly polite and patient, which I always get worried about when I'm with large groups. My pleases and thank yous are even that much more prominent when I feel like the server has a bit of a hassle to deal with. We got a seafood appetizer because if I see mussels on a menu and haven't heard horror stories, I must have them. Obsessed. The mussels were delicious, as were the shrimp, though heavily buttered and a little overwhelming. The calamari was also good, but I was way too focused on the mussels. We got the chicken saltimbocca (TO SHARE; remember, folks, these are sharing plates. Listen to your server and be honest when they ask if you've ever been here before!) and it was divine. The flavors were matched perfectly and it was a great combination of some of my favorite things! Lemon, artichoke hearts and capers! LOVE. The leftovers were even mouth watering. The rest of the dishes, from what I heard further down the booth, were equally as tantalizing. 

I'm not lying when I say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavors of this meal. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the staff was the equivalent and the food was perfect."}
{"text":"Leo (thats me) has eaten at other Buca de Beppos and had a much better time. Maybe they were just havin a bad day, but we waited a long time for waitress to take order, then we got the appetizer AFTER the main course. And then our kiddos had to wait 15 minutes for their little pizza thing. Seriously... the whole timing of the meal was way off."}
{"text":"My sister was visiting and we were attending a graduation for my best friends son. We decided to do Buca for lunch beforehand. We arrived at 1245 since we were meeting people nearby at 215. 
When we came in, we stood in the lobby for a good 5-7 minutes before I finally walked all around downstairs and into the kitchen and had to find someone. She was very flustered and rushed around while telling us how busy they have been all day. Remember- I just walked through the whole place to find an employee (the bar was even un-manned)- there was exactly 1 table of customers downstairs. not SO busy. Finally got seated by Theresa- upstairs in her section. There was another 1 occupies table upstairs that did not even have drink orders taken yet. It took Theresa 3 trips to our table before she asked for our drink orders. 
Gave us menus and told us she was going to take the other tables drink order then would come back for ours. She took their order and returned with bread for us. Told us she had to go find out for another table if they have lasagna and then she would come back for drink order. 
Third trip- finally took drink order. This service continued as she made several useless trips to our table and did nothing. once our food finally arrived, we all commented about how bland it was. No flavor at all- and we had 4 different entrees. 
At this point- we really needed to hurry as it was almost 2pm already, so we told her again that we were in a hurry to get to graduation. She asked about the check splitting and wrote it down. We also asked for boxes. She left and came back 5 minutes later with no checks, but wanted to confirm the split. She was incorrect and we explained it again. then she said she was still looking for boxes.  One person sent her card with and said- \"I'm in a hurry- I'm just paying for mine\". She left again- came back and had ran my friends card for 2 other peoples meals completely and the other check she got was wrong. She brought boxes by this time and started to pack up our food. we had to tell her to please just handle the checks, we can pack our own food. This is when it all changed. Theresa then got upset at US because we told her what she had done. Her face went stone cold and her tone was condescending. She stated it was OUR FAULT for not telling her it was separate checks. Again- we told her twice and she wrote it down. 
We ended up paying all kinds of weird, were late to graduation and had a terrible meal. Never will return."}
{"text":"Incredible customer service! The food was also great. I am very pleased with my visit today! I will for sure go back and will recommend others!! I had the lunch lasagna, mixed salad (the dressing) was amazing and garlic cheese bread."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Ravioli had spoiled ricotta cheese and the meal was just ... nasty. Nothing authentic here but if you don't know what authentic Italian food tastes like, and you love loud, crowded places with sticky tables, eat here."}
{"text":"We recently had dinner with friends here while in Las Vegas for a conference.  They were able to seat us right away and their seating is very \"cozy\" and quiet so you can have a good conversation and enjoy the family style service, with their most generous portions.  Even their \"small\" portion was enough for 5 of us on some of the items.  There were 3 out 5 Italians in our group, and everyone enjoyed the food!  Highly recommend you treat yourself her while you're in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience, my wife and I loved the food and the atmosphere. The service was good nothing amazing, but it was perfectly adequate. Overall would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of Buca but after a day of travel, we were ravenous. We were staying at the Excalibur so this was pretty convenient and located on the second floor. We had a party of 6 and ordered 3 small entrees, a salad, and a side. We actually finished all the food, and surprisingly the food was good! Not sure if it was because we were hungry or not, but the meal was surprisingly pleasant! They also have an all day happy hour, $3 beers at the bar (select beers)."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy Buca di Beppo!

I am fascinated by how this place is decorated. All the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience or interesting at the very least.

One thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat here, although I am always finding coupons for this restaurant so that helps. I am sad to report that they can be fairly stingy with coupons here though. They wouldn't take a coupon that had only been expired for like a week, which disappointed me.

Aside from that the food is awesome! I go with my wife and we love the calamari and the garlic bread, which we sometimes get as appetizers. We switch up the main course when we go, but each time has had pretty good results. We had dessert here once or twice too and that was also good! We usually end up with leftovers, because they give huge portions. The portion size is truly gigantic, so you definitely want to share an entree here with others."}
{"text":"Way over-priced!  The food is pretty good, but no better than some of the other Italian places in town.  We ordered a large Cesar Salad and paid $25.  We could have gotten the same amount at Oreganos for $11.  Our total bill was $162 for 6 adults and 3 small kids.  I would have paid $100 - $120 at Rigatonys for the same meal.

DO NOT BRING KIDS, for all the nudity on display.  I enjoy full frontal nudity, like everyone else; but, not when I have my grand kids in tow, and certainly when I am trying to enjoy a meal.  I was hoping that everyone else, at our table, wouldn't notice the 8x10 painting of a women leaving nothing to the imagination.  But, after a while, they did!  I would've switched tables or left the restaurant; but, we were into the first course before I noticed, plus, it was too late having kids there that night.

It's no wonder that the place was practically empty on a Thursday night, when other places are so busy."}
{"text":"We visited Las Vegas and came here with our local cousins at Thanksgiving. The place was so packed!! We were a group of 16 and had to wait for over an hour with all the kids... The stuff was very nice and felt bad about it so they managed to set us the VIP round table with the Lazy Susan and the Pop (that was funny, in light of the fact we are Jewish :-D)
The resturant is very unique with its decor, no bare wall left - but this makes it special
We took the Thanksgiving menu which was surprisingly great! They managed to cook the turkey so well it was very good and not dry at all! We also had the Apple Gorgonzola Salad, which was delicious.
The Pumpkin pie dessert was good!"}
{"text":"Just stay home & open jar of pasta sauce & throw it in some noodles. Food was warm not hot, the meatball pasta we ordered was watery and bland, the meatballs were ok but maybe would've tasted better if they were warm all the way through. It made me think these food items are not made fresh to order and then warmed up again in mr microwave. We also ordered the Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken & the middle was barely warm. My hubby doesn't like to send items back to the kitchen ever so I was stuck eating overpriced mediocre Italian food. The kids got those cute cups that light up on the bottom. They loved those. The decor is cute and looks like at one point was a happening place. We were seated downstairs and when I went to use the restroom upstairs there was a slight stench of sewer that grew stronger as I walked towards the restrooms and when I opened the door to the ladies restroom I got slapped in the face w the awful stank of the sewer that was so violently strong I gagged ...I instantly back up & went downstairs. There were people upstairs eating dinner also...with the smell lingering around. I will NEVER eat there again. The food was gross, they don't cook fresh to order, it's ala cart that is over priced and it stunk in there. Now I know why there are always coupons to eat here. They are desperate to get people in and draw poor fools in w coupons... Literally just stay home or eat somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Bucca- traditional Italian style, great pictures all over the walls. It is interesting how they take guests though the kitchen for seating in the main dining area- you can see the food being made fresh and the aroma- yes that makes you hungry!

great selection of wines, nice choice of menu and specials and tasty Italian food. It is a little on the expensive side than a corner italian joint, but we are talking North Scottsdale- so that should not be a show stopper. Great food, great ambiance- best with great company :)"}
{"text":"If you stop seating before your closing time (12am) it should be stated. I walked up at 11:23 and was denied a table and given take out as an only option right after I watched another couple walk in seconds before that because they had a reservation."}
{"text":"I just got out of this place because we waited over 18 minutes to be served and we were the only ones in the restaurant. even complaining at the exit nobody appeared to care"}
{"text":"The restaurant smelled funny and that food was just ok. We received plates with our bread and no plates with the salad. When we received plates for the family style entrees, they seemed a bit cold. As if these were the salad plates we should have received before."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here with friends on a quick trip to Vegas. We had a 3 year old with us and she really liked the crayons. We had drinks, spaghetti and salads. It was crowded but they got us right in and we were in a bit of a hurry as some folks needed to catch a flight. They were great about getting our food out fast and same with the check. Solid."}
{"text":"Not a very good take out experience.   We ordered a salad and 3 pasta dishes.  Salad was fine but all 3 pasta dishes disappointed

Penne San remo was dry.   Spaghetti with meat sauce seemingly skipped most of the meat sauce and the Quattro al forno was a tiny portion for $21

Would not suggest take out from buca.   The price/value relationship is way off"}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive after midnight deals on a Saturday night.  Service and ambiance was good. The drinks and pizza were fine but for their normal hours prices I'm not sure it would be worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Brought my uncle here for dinner because I wanted him to try the wonderful Lasagna they have.  What a mistake that ended up being.  There was maybe 1/4 of the amount of ricotta cheese that is normally there (and that is shown in all the pictures) so the whole thing tasted like mush.  No texture....my uncle even said \"this tastes like they put it in a blender it's so soft).  

We also ordered the brussel sprouts but i think they forgot them in the oven for about 15 minutes too long. Totally dry and way overcooked.

We asked the waiter to give us some balsamic vinegar because they were really overcooked and he didn't even offer to get us new ones or to even ask about them.

Needless to say, I won't go to this Buca again and it will be a long time till I try any of them again."}
{"text":"The price range is deceptive because they serve family style. At first I thought the \"small\" was overpriced until I realized you could feed 3-4 people on one. For a franchise I find the quality decent. The service was great and they also regularly publish generous coupons...which entices us to add an appetizer or dessert. They make the money back."}
{"text":"The shrimp Alfredo is fantastic! But the waiter was kind of like a car salesman. He kept trying to tempt us with drinks, and at one point, he said \"Oh! I forgot to ask if you two wanted bread!\" (Keep in mind, he knew it was my first time there) Thinking it was complimentary, I said yes. Thank you for selling us 10 dollar bread. Excellent food and service,  but please don't press things on customers! And maybe let them know that it costs an arm and a leg first!"}
{"text":"My niece wanted pasta. I gave her pasta! I have not been to Buca di Beppo in 10 years (since I left Vegas). let me tell you that I've been saying Buca di peppo . I ordered regular spaghetti for my niece and the spaghetti and meatball for myself. I wanted her to see the massive meatball. She was tickled and even took a selfie capturing how it was too large for her mouth. She gave the pasta a 10/10 and even asked me to order some to go."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not \"Little Italy\" or the Bronx in New York, but it's great fun and the food is more than enjoyable, with a strong menu and fine service."}
{"text":"Okay, I love Buca. It's not Little Italy in Lower Manhattan or the Bronx, but the food's great, though not especially creative; the service is fine and there's plenty of parking Love the spaghetti and meatball(s) -- Generally one's enough...and I never share"}
{"text":"Place is disgusting smell like piss when you walk in service is good food is sub par don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Disappointed with our dinner tonight. Usually we eat at the Scottsdale bucca ....both service and food is way better at that location.

Service was very slow and the restaurant wasn't crowded at all. Food was mediocre and we had to return the veal parm because it was chewy and tough. Meatballs were ok as was the baked rigatoni. We had bruschetta for an appetizer and it seemed like the serving size was much less than we are used to. the Best part of the meal was the Italian cream cake....scrumptious and enough for four people to share.

The manager was very nice and removed the veal parm from our bill, no questions asked.

Overall experience was not what we expected, unfortunately....I think we'll stick with the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"It was my sons graduation party from high school.  2 months ago we made reservations for the \"Pope room\" my sons request for his graduation.  We arrived 20 min. Early. We waited 45 more minutes then we were told our choice for the Pope room was given to some other party . I was lied to by the staff so asked to speak to manager . He was a liar also so We will never go there again . Stay away if it's a special occasion.  They don't care about their reservation being honored."}
{"text":"Our first time at bucca the services was good not great but good the food was real good I liked it family style dinner   I would go back"}
{"text":"I just cannot believe how bad this restaurant is.  The room is decorated nicely but trust me that is it for the positive side.  I don't know how long it has been open for the service was really spotty.  The tables are too small for the family style service and we constantly had to ask for plates to eat on.  We started with a caesar salad that was really plain and had a very sweet pungent dressing.  The salad was delivered and placed on the wrong table before we received it.  We ordered the Chicken Limone, and the Veal Parmesan with two sides of pasta.   The chicken was tender, but flavorless and had virtually no sauce and two small capers.  The Veal was so sweet it tasted like sugar was literally sprinkled directly on the meat.  The sides of pasta were overcooked and the sauce was also sickeningly sweet and looked like it came out of a can.  
Overpriced, amateur staff, and really bad food."}
{"text":"Not sure why they have such a low review. We booked our wedding reception here. We eat at the one in Houston. 
We had 31 people. Very accommodating. Only slow where you would imagine from serving 31 people. One the drinks were done everything was smooth. Wait staff wad great. Food was amazing as always."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Staff very rude. On plus side there portions are huge. Never had problem at other locations. Manager and person who takes to go orders need some courses to have better customer service and communication skills . Will not return at this location!!!!"}
{"text":"He and my girlfriend came over tonight to have some fettucini alfredo and we just ordered the two small one would have been plenty our server Luis was very nice and courteous we will return."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT family restaurant to eat at. The prices are reasonable and the food was excellent. I'm picky about my Alfredo sauce and this one passed the test. The sauce was creamy and the chicken tasted great.  The price for a meal to feed 2-3 was the same as I paid for one plate the night before and the portions were generous,  we had lots that went uneaten The server was friendly and when we asked him a question about something we were thinking of doing he gave us so much good information. Our wait wasn't very long at all and our food came out pretty quick considering how busy they were. 
Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"The staff was awesome!

Matt and Norrese made our anniversary very special. They interacted with our children and we had a great time!

We sat in the kitchen at Chef Bob's  table and the kitchen was very clean. Not often you get to see behind the scenes at a great restraunt.  Bob made the visit in the kitchen worthwhile since we really were not sure if we would like it or not; it was a blast!

We will definitely be back and can't wait to sit in the kitchen again!"}
{"text":"Many Great family dinners!!! anywhere entertaining to keep the kids busy is always a plus!!!"}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of advertisements for this place for a long time and finally decided to try it with a 20% off voucher. The ambience was nice and the food offered a great value. If you have a party of 4 or 5 you can easily feed them a appetizer and entree for under $70 total. With that being said if you're less than a party of that size you won't find much value in eating here. The prices are about $20 for ANY appetizer and $25-32 for any entree. Of course, they are meant to be shared but smaller parties are stuck taking food home. 

We ordered baked ziti which was $28 and over priced for the flavor and execution of the dish. Tasted more like Mac and Cheese with a hint of tomatoes. 

We weren't impressed overall with the food or prices and will stick with Maggianos or Battistas Hole in the Wall."}
{"text":"I was the first customer for the day, around 11:40 am on a Tuesday, but I was made to wait by the door for 5 minutes. Right as I stepped into the restaurant, the host picked up his cell phone and walked away. I had to peer into the main eating area for a couple seconds for him to come back out and seat me because I was tired of waiting with no one to talk to. He said that he thought I was there for pick-up. Shouldn't he have clarified my purpose of visiting while I walked in? Hmm. 

Anywhoo, I had a coupon for an individual lunch item so my choices were kind of confined (not a bad thing...I'm horrible when it comes to deciding) so I ordered Shrimp Fra Diavlo. I was pleasantly surprised when my pasta arrived within 10 minutes of placing my order, piping hot. This sort of made up for me waiting at the front when I arrived. It was so creamy and savory. The shrimp was soft and buttery, just melting in my mouth. Albeit an individual item, the serving size was generous as I was only able to eat a third before asking for a to-go box.

My server was really awkward, which made for a really awkward lunch, especially because I was dining in alone. He kept hinting at dessert and whatnot when I was barely deciding on my entree. Chillll dude, I'll tell you if I want dessert after. I sampled Bellissima, a Prosecco, because it was advertised at the front. I recommend it to anyone who wants a light wine to complement their meal."}
{"text":"My first and last time at Buca di Beppo. If I was not with friends, we would have left. The food was awful. We ordered the veal parm and speghetti and meatballs.  The veal was tougher than chicken fried steak might have been. It was over fried and dark crusty. The meatballs were overcooked and had darkened crust. The bread that was brought out to us was cold, maybe it was supposed to be that way."}
{"text":"Would have given no stars but was forced to give one in order to write a review. This was a restaurant my family loved to go to years ago but not anymore! The place was only open three hours today and when we sat down we stepped on croutons and utensils and sugar packets under our table! Not clean! Our server didn't know any of the four questions we asked about the menu and answered \"yeah I think\" . Our server brought us bread that was cold. We ordered from the appetizer menu and they brought us an older version of their \"trio\" which contained mushrooms. My husband hates mushrooms so I know I didn't order it. They took our plate and brought us the new updated menu version only for our original two other apps of the trio to be cold.  When our correct appetizer finally came , the breading on the mozzarella was stale and tasted rancid. When our main dishes came out they were smoking hot which was great but our server didn't bring our side salads first and we never received them and now I'm only remembering this as we are driving away! I told the manager we will pay for our drinks but we are not staying and we are not paying for the food. She asked if there was anything we wanted to take with us and we answered \"no. No thank you. We are really grossed out at this point.\" She brought our bill and did in fact charge us for our drinks. I offered of course, because it was the only part of our meal that was pleasurable but the whole experience was disgusting and the whole bill should have been removed. We will not be back. Ever! Who wants the remainder of gift card?!? Lol"}
{"text":"Always a favorite when we come to Phoenix from Tucson!!
Service is always great and Kyle was very attentive!!"}
{"text":"Am I doing another 5K? Why am I carbo loading? -- questions that were running through my head as I had more bites. 

We ordered fettuccine supreme, baked ziti, pepperoni pizza, and cheesy garlic bread. Also ordered Sassy Strawberry Italian soda.

So glad we only ordered the small size. Between the 5 of us, there were still plenty of left overs. About half a plate for both fettuccine and baked ziti. But maybe it's because we weren't really impressed with the food. Really liked the soda though, in all it's strawberry goodness!

Service was on the slow side. We had reservations for 4:00 and arrived on time but still had to wait 10-15mins to get seated. Another few minutes for our server to get our order. The entrees didn't come til 20 minutes or so later and yes, I was timing it 'cause I thought my sister was on some kind of schedule. 

Also this location is pricier than other Bucas so don't be shy to use those coupons that they lured you in with"}
{"text":"Reasonable priced Italian food with a interesting atmosphere. This is a great place a gathering of any kind. If you have never been before tell the hostess and they will walk you for a little tour of the kitchen.

I have been eating here for years on many different occasions and I always leave full and pleased with what I ordered. For a larger party call ahead and make a reservation. They have a variety of strange and interesting dinning areas you can choose from if you reserve a table. The food is served mostly in family style portions which is to say most things you order will feed more then 2 people. Before you order the server usually warns you about the portions so you know what to expect. The food here is above the Olive Garden standard. They serve food which is more Italian home style. Overall the food is tasty and the atmosphere makes for a great time at a reasonable price. They also have a constant running coupon in the papers dinning section which will save you some money!"}
{"text":"I went Memorial Day Weekend.

Service was good and bad.  It was good because it was our first time at BdB, and we did not know about serving sizes.  We opted for 1 small appetizer and 3 small main courses for 5 people.  Our waiter said that would be a lot of food, and he only recommends 2 small main courses.  So we trusted him and he was definitely right.
Service was bad because, our food took 45 minutes to come out.  The people who had came at the same time as us ordered right away and got their food quite fast.  When they had finished their meal we were still waiting for our food.

Food was good and bad as well.  The food was good because the sauces were delicious.  The pasta seemed undercook and still a bit hard.

Maybe service and food was bad because of the Memorial Day Weekend, so not quite sure."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but the service ruined everything. I went with a group of 4 people. When we arrived we were told that there would be a 30-40 minute wait (my fault for not getting a reservation). They ended up getting us to a table in closer to 20 minutes. 

When we got our table we noticed that about half the restaurant was empty. There were only 3 tables occupied in our section so we thought things would go smoothly. We waited for another 30+ minutes before anyone came to take our drink orders. Don't worry, the drinks took forever to arrive after that too. When the drinks finally came we had to wait again. 

It was almost as if they didn't want to take our food order. Finally a manger came to take our order. This was the one glimmer of hope that the restaurant had all night. She brought us some free bread for our wait and took our food order. While waiting for our food to arrive she took pretty good care of us. Brought some more bread, filled our drinks, etc. However, once she brought our food we never saw her again. 

Nobody came by to refill drinks or do anything while we ate. I eventually went to the kitchen to get our drinks refilled. I had to track down an employee to order dessert and request our check. 20 minutes later we had no dessert and no check. We asked 4 different employees to get us our dessert and check. One of them eventually brought the check but it was still another wait to get the dessert. 

In total we spent almost 3 hours at Buca di Beppo. Most of the time was just waiting."}
{"text":"A nice change of pace from many of the other Italian eateries and good size portions but to claim their large feeds four people is a stretch. It is a bit on the pricy side and the food is just ok, but it is a fun place to eat and the staff generally try to amuse you throughout your dining experience. All in all it's something different and fun, but if your there just for the food you might be a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't go to this restaurant on a full stomach. All the food is a la carte. It's great food. Good service. Must go."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo seems to be a place for people who don't really like Italian food.  They can't seem to master the simple fare.  Pasta tends to be overcooked, sometimes dried out.  Seasonings for many dishes is almost non-existent.  The only attraction seems to be that they have huge servings.  If you prefer a lot of relatively tasteless food, this is the place for you.  No, I have never worked for this or any other restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been going to Buca since 1999 in Pasadena I have always enjoyed the food and service However Peoria Arizona location had horrible service and the restaurant was not clean it was ran by High School kids our server Jessica was rude and the busboy was cussing and complaining about his job to us while we ate, when we left I asked for a after dinner mint and the hostess was talking to other employees ignoring me a said there over there if we have any ! Very Rude and not like Buca in Ca as I been to Pasadena, Huntington Beach , Santa Monica , 

Our Server Jessica forgot our dinner plates our drinks and simply did not care plus she did not get me a pitcher of Sangria when I asked for a pitcher but came back with a glass 20 minutes later she seemed bugged and we would of walked out but had hungry kids with us Never again in Peoria AZ I also will complain to Corporate as the food was good but the service and environment was horrible and not up to Buca Di beboo standard"}
{"text":"I have been to many Buca do Beppos this one was exactly what I have come to expect. Amazing food , great customer service and unique and interesting decor."}
{"text":"It was a bad choice for people who don't do group food.  It was a work meeting.

We had the private room.  We were taken thru the kitchen to get there ... but there were 2 corridors next to the room that was a little weird.  Two large cutouts from the walls let us hear families in other rooms ... which made it hard to hear our conference call.

The waitress was very attentive and willing to split the checks from the very beginning.

The tomato soup was chunky and flavorful.  The small antipasta salad was dinner and lunch entrees.

Everyone enjoyed their meals but were overwhelmed by portion size."}
{"text":"Been awhile since I've gone, and usually with a group. It was nice with lunch they do have smaller options. Also a few gluten-free meals. Better than I ever remembered."}
{"text":"Bucca is over priced.  Recently had dinner here (total of 3 people), bill was over $100.  We had small salad, small pasta dish (Macaroni Rosa), Lemon Chicken and green beans.  No alcohol or desserts.  We took home the pasta dish only to learn that they did not include the chicken that was suppose to be in it.   What a disappointment.

I can go to a better Italian Restaurant  for better food and less money.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Joe was our server. He was hilarious and he brought our food quickly. Not to mention the food was amazing and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"This is not my fave place for spaghetti and pasta with red sauce, however...this restaurant creates the most awesomest anti-pasto salad in the whole world! I also love the pasta san remo, which has a white wine sauce, the pesto chicken, pizza and a few other pasta dishes. The service is always great and the location is perfect."}
{"text":"If you go to this location, make sure Josh is not your server. We waited 15 minutes at the table before we were even greeted. Upon greeting us, he didn't try to explain the menu at all. He simply asked us what we would like. Ok, whatever he's not a friendly server. No problem. An hour later, we still haven't gotten our appetizer. A family of four who arrived 30 minutes after us were eating. Finally the appetizer arrived, shortly followed by our food. We got fried mozzarella so no reason that takes an hour to prepare. The food was great, but the server never came back to ask us how it was. We noticed him being very friendly with other tables and checking up on them regularly. We never even received drink refills. In fact, we never saw our server again. Some other server (Michele) was very nice and brought us our check and boxed up our food. Not sure what we did to make him ignore us. We didn't even have the chance to make him mad. Great food, but extremely lousy service."}
{"text":"I went to Buca for the first time with my boyfriend last night and I loved it, it was so good! We had an amazing server named Peter and he was such a great help for recommending good dishes to us! We started off with the garlic cheesy bread and it was so good, and had he delicious chopped antipasto salad, than went into our fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and that was so good, and of course we had to finish up with the cannoli for dessert which was amazing! Definitely very large portions but that makes it all the better because you get leftovers! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Imagine you're a semi fat out of shape kid.. and you're in P.E class trying to keep up with the skinny kids during track day, so you start sprinting. But you know God damn well you can't last so you crash and fall. Tired af. That's my interpretation of tonight. Night started off great, they took our order and brought the bread and salad fast. Almost immediately. Then after the entree came.. came the fat tub of lard crashing to the floor of exhaustion. Took about half an hour to get the check. Trying to get that 5 dollar parking since the strip charges now wtf. They tryna hustle us to pay 10 bucks parking by making us dine in longer. Jk. But the waitress, while we seen her was really nice, like the nice fit kid who didn't make fun of you and talked to you ever so often as he overlapped you 5 times. The food was really good though! Like the m&ms in the 1.50 vending machine after class!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for happy hour for beers were $5 all day, we ordered a house salad and eggplant parmigiana. The salad was soggy tasted like it was pre-made and sitting in dressing all day! The eggplant parmigiana was salty and hard, did not taste good! I hardly ate it because it tasted horrible! If Gordon Ramsey walked into this place and tasted the dishes he would say that it tasted like shit and it looks discussing!

When we complained about the food to the manager he took the eggplant parmigiana off the bill and we only paid for the drinks and salad, which I hardly ate also. My mom had most of the salad and I left hungry because we were going to see a show. The waitress came over and apologize to us and said that it wasn't made fresh! I was looking at her like wtf what did they do microwave the food that was served?! All I could think of was the kitchen nightmares with Gordon Ramsey where the one restaurant kitchen staff prepares all the food then reheats it in the microwave! I rather go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in planet Hollywood at least I know that place has standards being that it his restaurant compared to bucca which use to be good!"}
{"text":"It's a Buca di Beppo.  We tend to order the spicy chicken rigatoni mostly.  They have that dialed.  Too bad the have to repeat the same pictures on different walls, there must be more pics out there somewhere."}
{"text":"We've been here for three hours. I'd love to tell you about the food but we haven't received it yet. We didn't have a reservation so we had to wait for 90 minutes before getting a boot h in the bar. Our waitress is the only bartender in the entire restaurant so she's too busy for us. Now we've been waiting for 90 minutes for our entrees. The restaurant is now closed."}
{"text":"If I could have given no stars I would have but it won't let me. We just had the absolute WORST Service at the buca di beppo in the Excalibur. We sat for a little over an hour with only two waters on our table, no house bread and the server never came back till after the hour mark and told us \"someone\" left your food in the window we will have to remake it and walked away. Needless to say I walked up to the manager and explained everything that had been wrong he could have cared less just telling us we were good to go. Well of course we were we never had ANYTHING but water on our table. Oh and this was for lunch and they were not busy. Many open tables. Very poor customer service. I worked for a buca for over 5 years and I'm in shock at how horrible this experience was"}
{"text":"Good old fashioned Italian food. Portions are sizable. Tonight my husband, daughter and I dined on fresh eggplant park and large order of spaghetti and meatballs. Eggplant was crisp with great taste accompanied by marinara sauce and cheese. Pasta was on point. Very full so we did not have dessert. We had reservations. Were promptly seated and waited on just as timely. Go and check it out. Good Italian consistent as a chain."}
{"text":"The bread was the only thing good about the place! 

From the exterior of the place I thought it would be nice to try some Italian. They serve family style, meaning one dish serves all. 

That would be ok if it was actually good. The bread was decent. I ordered Rigatoni with Rosa. The Rigatoni itself was way overcooked. The Rosa sauce was watery and had a taste I couldn't exactly describe, possibly tin can like. I didn't care for it at all. 

One bite and I was through."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant many times and have loved it, but this last time is the worst! The food here has gradually gone down hill. I spent way too much for the dried out poor quality I received! What the heck happened?!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for my birthday and we both had fabulous meals. My wife had the eggplant parmigiana and I had the salmon. I don't think there's a bad plate on the menu. Jarrett was our server and we couldn't be more pleased with his service. We will be back again."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but I ordered a pizza to go and came back when I was told. I had to wait like an extra 15 mins than my original wait and this was originally supposed to be an order on the go. The to-go service is lacking because many of the workers won't even acknowledge if you're not staying to sit down. I would say come for the food, but leave for the service."}
{"text":"This was pretty good Italian food. The fettuccine Alfredo was delicious and the cannoli is amazing. In my opinion the pizza and spaghetti are nothing special though, the average person could make better spaghetti sauce at home"}
{"text":"This is defiantly a place to big a large family or a group of friends! However if you are going in a smaller group such as 2-3 people I would not recommend this place at all and here is why... All the dishes are served family style which means you must all agree on all your selections unless your going to have a lot of left overs and will be left with a large bill at the end which brings me to my next point. If you are in a smaller group and you all don't agree on a dish and you get a something only you will eat you will most likely spend between $20-$35 per dish now if you are if a larger group that's great! I wish this restaurant offered a menu for couples of two with much smaller portions or even a small list of items which you can get just one of and not need to share. If we would have known that this restaurant was only family style we would have not gone here because it was such a waste for us. There is a plus and a nice touch to this restaurant there was a photographer coming to each table and taking a \"free\" photo ( which is the size of a post stamp ) unless you want to spend $25 for one or $30 for two. Overall the atmosphere was great and all the employees were very friendly. Remember if you have a large group this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, fun atmosphere but food wasn't any better than a a fast food Italian restaurant. We started with the trio appetizer, the first time it came out everything was cold. Second time, the calamari was overcooked, the mushrooms had been warmed up in the microwave and were like hot lava and the fried cheese was still cold. 
The salad was a big bowl of lettuce and red onions, eggplant parm was over cooked and could not be eaten, shrimp fra diavolo was so spicy we couldn't eat and the pasta was undercooked.
All in all the food was not good , and will not visit again"}
{"text":"For such a big name in the Italian food department I was disappointed at this location particularly. Perhaps they've lowered their standards in the staffing department? Staff was short, not entirely diligent and somewhat stand-off ish. The pizza we ordered was SOGGY and I wouldn't recommend it. The Shrimp Florentine was decent and extremely oily. I gave the location on flamingo a shot and it was an upgrade from this location."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Easily some of the best Italian food I've had. You certainly get what you pay for, the portions are no joke. If you are in the mood for a classy, delicious Italian dinner... this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Draftin this as I sit abandoned, unattended in the bar section of this place. Hyped up by my boyfriend, I truly expected better customer service than what I'm currently getting. Still dont have a menu and no one has said a word to me, no hello, what can I get you, oh? You don't have a menu? Let me get you one. How about a drink? You know, what you should be asked the moment you sit at a \"fine italian establishment\" like this. Wait. My bf just grabbed a waiter blindly passing us by and asked for some menus, looks like the dude's lightbulb turned on for a moment. Hopefully we'll see him back with some menus soon though from the looks of it now I doubt it. We're back to not existing again...if I get to eat here or end up even staying. ...dont have to say it. You know I'm not coming back..."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic tasting family style Italian fare. That's where the positive review ends, however. Dining in here is simply not an option for our family. We tried eating here once and waited 35 minutes after being seated to simply place drink orders. After deciding to give it another shot, we waited 25 minutes after being seated before giving up having never seen a server. The manager in this establishment simply has no care for her restaurant and the wait staff is inattentive at best. There is no reason to dine in here when you can get more reliable service elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had made reservations for Valentine's Day at 6:15 through OpenTable and when we arrived they were running about twenty five minutes behind. That's alright because it is a busy day for restaurants. So that is understandable. What really irritated me was that I requested a booth and it was confirmed via internet AND phone that there would be a booth available for us. But when it came down to sitting down, there was no booth. I asked and they said none were available...even when I pointed to one across from me. The hostess said they need them to seat more people. Ten minutes later, a couple is seated there. I don't know if you can understand my frustration but that made me livid. Our waitress hardly checked on us. Water was always empty. Her personality was the same as cardboard. Overall, food was great. Service and seating was terrible at this location. I definitely have had better experiences with this chain at other locations."}
{"text":"Buca's is always a fun place to go and eat with friends. As usual, the food was consistent delicious as always. The Scottsdale Buca's was one of the best I've been to.. They fit us on the schedule to get in on the chef's table located in the kitchen. What an experience for 3 people who had never been to Buca's. Waiters was incredible and kitchen was extremely clean! Nice job Scottsdale Buca Di Beppo, keep it up, you're the standard for a BDB's."}
{"text":"My first time here (my wife has eaten here once before). 
We were greeted at the door with a friendly smile and seated immediately. 
Our server was helpfully explaining portion sizes (large- for two). Drinks and appetizer  were rapidly brought to our table.  Drinks never left empty. However, she was short on personality. Still, she did her job well. 
This is very unique, with many quaint seating areas.  Nice swingy music at a nice level for \"background music.\" (not too loud like so many restaurants)
Our meal came quickly. 
Food was good.  
I will return."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try. Once again it took forever for the food to come out. The waitress barely checked on us. The mozzarella garlic bread was horrible. It left a funny taste in my mouth and was unlike any garlic bread I've ever had. The lasagna wasn't good either. Tasted like a bad microwave lasagna. The only thing that was decent was the chicken parm. I don't know why people talk about Buca so much when the service is consistently bad and the food is horrible.   

First visit- Waitress was extremely weird. On top of that our dinner came out after waiting a long time and we had to ask where our appetizer was...she said she forgot about it. Then told us it wasn't very good anyway. Food wasn't good at all!"}
{"text":"Recently had a rehearsal dinner there for my sons wedding our total party had 25 people.  My biggest complaint was there wasnt enough food served for everyone at the table to try everything.  We were seated at one long table and the food was brought in and placed mostly at the ends.  By the time the serving plates reached those in the middle they were pretty much empty and the servers didnt bring anymore food.  Also cheesecake and cannoli were to be served for desert.  There was only enough cheesecake for half the guests and the rest had to have cannoli.  Really dissapointing.  Also, the food on the whole was just so-so...pretty much on the level of Olive Garden.  Im not a fan of \"family style\" plating so with so many other choices for Italian around town I dont think I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, the décor, and the food in this restaurant! I have been coming to this restaurant for years. I have had birthday parties and fun family meals here. The staff shows first timers the kitchen by walking them through it. They sing happy birthday holding a candelabra at your table. The restaurant has family pictures and vintage Italian items all over the walls. This is a family style Italian restaurant as the portions are large.

On this recent visit, I shared some of my favorite items at this restaurant with a friend. If you like salads that have fruit and nuts in them try the Apple Gorgonzola Salad. It has Granny Smith apples, walnuts, dried cranberries, and Gorgonzola tossed with Italian vinaigrette. We also had the Mozzarella Caprese. The tomatoes were very good and the mozzarella was fresh. I loved the basil olive oil on top.

The Eggplant Parmigiana for an entrée was a hit with me! The eggplant is not too thick or thinly cut. It is topped with basil and mozzarella in addition to marinara sauce.

I don't usually have the offering of red wine, but I was talked into the Allegrini Veronese with my meal. Excellent choice. Great evening."}
{"text":"I am having my baby shower here on may 14th, I wanted to write a before and after review do people really have a good idea of my experience. First off dip far I could not be any happier! I need to say what an ANGEL Lori has been, from day one she has made everything so simple and has accommodated me in every way possible. When I went in to view the space I brought my three year old and she was so kind to him and catered top him as much as me! For a person who is pregnant  (with twins) and a stressed mom already that was just so nice.  The space was exactly what we needed and could take up to 50 guests, after we viewed the space I told Lori we would be staying for luch,  she got us the table in the kitchen with an awesome waiter and she made sure to check on us as well. The food was amazing, and so were the cannoli I am from NJ and my mom is Italian so I think I'm a pretty good judge. When I asked for the check I was told our meal was on them,  touches like this are what set a place apart when you are looking to plan a special occasion. Lori has checked in with me every step of the way,  making sure my needs are met and that I am happy and informed. I am so excited for my shower tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Went here with my bf for our anniversary. It's not bad. When I arrived we were seated after about 5 minutes. It was so cold in the dining room you could hang meat in there.  When the host who sat us say me shivering he offered to turn it down. Which was greatly appreciated. The decor is pretty much like R rated tilting towards erotica. There is a picture of a man picking a piece of spaghetti off of a woman cleavage, a topless Mona Lisa, and some Italian ladies deep throating pasta with their cleavage showing. So I would not recommend taking kids.But it was OK for a date night.

Meals are ordered family style. Me and bf shared a Penne San Remo which had artichokes, sundried tomatoes, and peas in a cream sauce. It was tasty put mostly pasta, it needed more of the veggies. We also got the lasagna, it was the size of a cinder block. The meat in in I have to say was really low quality. It was too finely ground beef, almost powdery, like from a can or something. I was not a fan. We got the cocktails in the glass you get to take home. I had the pink posey it was pricey but really good and pretty strong.

Overall not a bad dinner but I have to say it was pretty expensive. We spent $75 without tip on 2 entree to share and 2 drinks. Our service was also very good and our waitress was very attentive and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Megan was awesome! I gave them points for the customer service experience. I had chicken marsala. The chicken was smothered in a delicious sauce but the chicken was cold and over cooked. The pasta that came with it was also COLD? 
I love the ambiance and employees but the food was not good and there's a lot if options nearby."}
{"text":"For sure a child friendly Italian chain restaurant. The food is simple, not going to blow you away but decent, make sure to take you ear plugs because its very loud. Not bad just loud chain restaurant, not too much to say. I had the apple gorgonzola salad which was decent and some pasta. I believe the calamari wasn't terrible for a chain. Godere!

{"text":"Last night was our second visit to this Buca location.  Our visit started great with the pleasant and polite hostess. Once we were seated we sat for 15 minutes, before receiving water.  The manager then came to assist and provided us with a different waitress name Celeste.  Celeste was attentive, informative, and had the perfect personality to match the three of us.  I only rated our visit 4 stars, because of the laspe in time it took to make our visit right.  The expediter was phenomenal as well! 

Personality is everthing in food service, it makes the most impatient person ok with waiting!!! The food was great and the birthday girl was happy with her cheesecake.  Thank you hostess, manager, expeditor, and a HUGE THANKS TO CELESTE, for an almost perfect experience."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for a party of 20 for my wedding rehearsal dinner on 4/26/18. Upon seating us, they informed us that the room we were sat in did not have working A/C (mind you it was nearly 100 degrees that day) and only offered us 1 fan to cool the entire room. Further inspection of the restaurant resulted in a women's restroom that smelled worse than a sewer which could be smelled from the hallway and a disgusting clogged toilet. The food was good and our waiter was adequate but the atmosphere was less than sub par and not at all what I had imagined for such a celebration."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we decided to visit Buca di Beppo. A long time ago they were in Buffalo too, but left a while ago. Time to catch up.
The portions come in 2 sizes, both shareable (there is a 3 and a 5 people size).
We decided on 2 dishes: Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and spaghetti with meatballs. Both dishes were wonderful. The rigatoni was nice, my favorite of the 2 dishes.
The spaghetti was cooked the way it is supposed to be, plenty of sauce and some wonderful meat balls. Not too bready, just fine.
We were with a group of 3 and yes, we had to take part of it home."}
{"text":"Coming from out of town, but have Buca's in my home town, and I have to say, NOT IMPRESSED. 
- Iffy service
- Portions over the top
- Drinks never refilled
- Servers not knowledgeable AT ALL about their menu.

But this confirms that ALL the Buca di Beppo's suck."}
{"text":"MAKE A RESERVATION!
What we had: Spaghetti and meatballs, Spicy chicken rigatoni NERO, cheesy bread Florentine, $20 pitcher of margaritas. 
Total: $112
Time of day: Saturday around 730- 8pm
Taste: Better than Olive Garden! The sauces are hearty and the meats have a delicious sear on the outside and are well seasoned. The Spicy rigatoni was delicious even with the peas. We ordered the smaller portions for a family of four and it did the job. I recommend the large serving of the cheesy Florentine bread. The margaritas were sweet and light on the liquor. 
Service: The hostesses in the front were chatty and a bit rude, they kept turning their backs to converse and laugh, they rolled their eyes at people walking by them. The waiter was friendly, and attentive. 
Restaurant: Large and a bit dated, but I think they intentionally have it this way because of their focus to \"old Italy\". I was clean, airy and lighting was dim."}
{"text":"Service is always great at this location. Buca used to be one of my favorites, until there decline in taste. The last time I ate here nothing disappointed me."}
{"text":"This review is for the Buca in Excalibur casino, I had an early dinner here on a Saturday evening and sat in the bar area off the side of the main restaurant.

Please be aware that the entrees are served family style, I can eat a lot, when I ordered for me and my companion the 'small' size entree's were PLENTY of food to eat.

We tried the 'Small' size calamari for the appetizer, it was very good and perfectly crunchy, for our main entree we had the 'Small' size chicken carbonara.  The food was very good and flavorful, for two of us we didn't finish it and had to take our leftovers with us.

The drinks were good, we had a glass of wine and draft beer with the meal, they do have Happy hour specials here as well.

The only complaint I had was with the 'Small' size of garlic bread we had on the side, the bread was too hard and not very buttery and could barely taste the garlic.  The portion size for the 'small' was huge though, so if you do order the garlic bread, the 'small' size is 16 mid size pieces which was over the top in my opinion for two people.

Overall, the food was good, nice ambiance, and our server was very helpful.  My recommendation for dinner for two, 1 small appetizer and entree should do the trick.  I will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Jarrett was an amazing waiter! Great service, made for a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner. And the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I eat here on Saturday October 28 the waitress Jordan never brought out waters nor did she greet us finally after 10 min Adrian finally noticed that Jordin was sleeping on the job.
And he apologize and took care of us 
Not only was Jordin or Jordyn lazy but she was sloppy. Dirty and a clumsy 
Jordyn should just be kept in the kitchen as a dishwasher 
And your bathrooms were nasty."}
{"text":"We had a group of 5 and all of the dishes we ordered were fantastic. Portions were large we have leftovers of every dish for everyone.  I recommend this to anyone who likes Italian food."}
{"text":"I just heard your not allowed to bring in your own cake for a birthday . They charge you $15.99 to store in a cake that's it . They don't have a sign no where that says that . They said it's on a piece of paper that they have . Not out in public by the door .  Just really annoying that we went out the way just to bring out ice cream cake . That's embarrassing  for a company to have . Makes it seem like they are broke and trying to take every cent from a customer . 
Olive Garden , Texas road house , chili's etc . They don't charge you at all"}
{"text":"Wow this place is fantastic!  The service was excellent from start to finish.  The hostesses were very gracious and gave us a warm greeting.  My wife and i were celebrating our 2 and a half month anniversary so obviously we had to go big or go home.  I love this calamari its a good thing squid have so many legs because the sauce was kickin!!!!  The quatro al forno is a must and if you have a big group be sure to have the brownie sundae!  The management was also very friendly.  Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"While in Indy, we LOVED to visit Buca's.  We've now been to this location three times and I just can't say much about it.  The food tasted nowhere near as good as it used to and the service was terrible.  Granted, we were a large group, but our waitress didn't even seem to try.  The children's menu has huge portions.  I actually enjoyed picking at its mac and cheese over our stuffed chicken.  I don't think we'll be bringing our club back to this Buca's, I'm sorry to say."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving dinner at 4 and guess what, were out of turkey wtf!!!!! Oh we left, seriously it's thanksgiving you have reservations and it's early"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! My husband, myself and two of our friends drove all the way from Statesville to eat here. The food was cold, our dinner didn't come out together (almost a 45 minute extra wait), and there was a piece of plastic in the lasagna the other couple ordered. Dinner ruined because who knows what else we could've bitten into, and who wants to eat cold food? The waitress was nice and bar drinks were great, but overall a horrible experience. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I dined alone in this family servings restaurant. Singles diners order from the lunch menu. The server was attentive. I ordered chicken parm and a glass of wine.  My drink and entree arrived with minimal wait. My entree was served before bread was brought to the table. The chicken parm and spaghetti was hot. It wasn't flavorful as I remembered from prior visit but it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I love this place. Took my girlfriend here for the first time. Wow, so much tasty food! Wine is good, coffee is amazing! Great service. For sure coming back!"}
{"text":"Visited this location on a Saturday evening. I made reservations online, showed up a little early, and pleasantly surprised that we were seated within 5 min even on a busy night. Our server, Jarrett, was fantastic. We ordered 4 items and an appetizer for 4 of us (2 large and 2 small)..... everything was fresh and delicious but very BIG portions. We had enough left over for the 4 of us to have a feast the next day and even lunch the 3rd day!!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken saltinbocca and \"creating your own pasta dish\" were out of this world. Stacy, our server, was extremely helpful, patient, and informative. The small portion here could feed a family of four, and are extremely flavorful. Be mindful that the dessert are just as large. The tiramisu is big enough for a soccer team, and two tennis players. Overall, try not to eat for a week before you come, because the portions are, well HUGE!"}
{"text":"The waiter was good, we had to wait for our beverage more than an average time in NYC, the waiter apologized for it, there was no reason for it because the place were less than 30% of capacity, the food was serve fast but was waitting for a more presentable plate, it was too ordinary, i guess i cant get something better for the same price around the strip..."}
{"text":"The eggplant parm is excellent, it has to be the best entree on the menu. The flavors were perfect and the eggplant was crisp. They brang out one of our entrées wrong but the server noticed right away and corrected it. The marinara is pretty bland and could use more seasoning. I like my pasta al dente and this spagetti was not, it kind of reminded me of spagetti from the mall food court. I wish they seasoned the food better and it wasn't so bland. The family style servings seem like a good idea economically until you get the bill and see you could have paid half elsewhere ordering your own entrées. Personally I think it is too pricey for what you get and the quality. The seats and tables are crammed, hard and uncomfortable. I remember this place being a lot better. I don't think I will come here again."}
{"text":"Went there on feb 21,with my son for my birthday. We had a small manicotti, small lasagne, and side of fetuccini Alfredo. Finished with my very favorite celebration cake. Service was awesome, food was great. We had such a great night. We went back on Monday for the same thing, this time, the server was so busy helping her larger parties that she seldom came by our booth. Our food must have sat quite awhile because it was cold. When we needed small plates for the appetizer, and a clean fork, I had to get them off of another table. For 85 bucks, I won't be going back.  To expensive to risk another bad experience."}
{"text":"Jarrett is the employee of the YEAR! he literally took the time to explain the menu to me. I will definitely be back and it's all thanks to him. GIVE THIS MAN A RAISE!"}
{"text":"Last minute decided to go out for dinner instead of cooking and did a quick look through of Groupons and found one for Buca $10 for $20 of food. Great we thought we won't spend so much money! Wrong.. Totally wrong the service was ok, water cups got pretty empty, server didn't seem to know the menu very well but she was nice and pleasant. 
Food was ehh nothing super or even great. Ordered a side of broccoli so the kids could have some vegetable with their super greasy pizzas but the broccoli is made with red chili peppers and I think the server should have let us know that. It burned my 2 year olds little mouth the second she tasted it. I tried it after and it was stupidly spicy. If a side dish is going to be so spicy it should have been clearer on the menu. The manager came by and said they took care of that off the bill, which was nice I didn't have to ask. My sister ordered just the mushroom Marsala sauce and pasta with no meat and at first they sent out just pasta with very little Marsala sauce but no mushrooms. 20 minutes later they brought the mushrooms and sauce. The sauce was tasty but with cold noodles not so much. The veggie pizza was decent, again nothing exciting. Big waste of money for one eh not so great meal. 

Update! I was contacted by the regional manager who was really apologetic and convinced me to give Buca another chance. He was very sincere and cares a great deal about his restaurants and the customers so we will be giving them another shot and hoping for a better visit. Was really impressed that I was actually contacted by someone and that they wanted to make it a better experience for my family. Will have a new review after our visit!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Although, most of our visits are for to-go orders. The service has always been friendly and we like the food. We usually don't veer off our regular items. We stick with chicken limone, chicken Marsala, and spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs. 

Remember the food items are family style and the prices are the high moderate side. My family of 5 can eat here for under $80, but you can easily pay $100 if you get another side or dessert.

I'm glad they are generous with their fresh bread!

Come here dressed casual as many families dine at this location."}
{"text":"I am just not a fan of this place.  It makes me say....eck.  I've been twice and both times I feel like i'm going into someone's cluttered house and eating leftovers for dinner.  The only fun thing is the wine...but even the table wine is eck.  But..it's table wine so I suppose I can't be too picky.  This place is just not for someone who actually loves Italian...it simply can't be.  It reminds me of frozen food.

If you try to go on a date here (why?  why would you do that you cheapskate?)  then get ready to get turned down for anything else that night.  This place is just blaaaaah.   If you want to experience authentic Italian in a home environment, go to Italy.  Honestly...your money will be better spent."}
{"text":"Ordered family size Chicken Parmesan to be delivered. $35 for the order plus tax delivery and tip. Comes with no pasta. We called, they only give you chicken. Really? Food was mediocre. No pasta for that price was ridiculous. So if i order a pizza there does it cost extra for crust? Spaghetti and meatballs only comes with meatballs? Gin and tonic only comes with tonic? This place is one to avoid."}
{"text":"This place is excellent for large groups. On this particular occasion, I was just picking up pizza as it's my girlfriends favorite pizza. Pepperoni is great. Last time we also got some white pizza that everyone loved. It had tons of garlic on it. Yum!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere here previously.  Lately the food has declined.  Have also ordered take out a few times recently and each time food was prepared differently __ new chefs?  With the last time we ordered we spent two days with the porcelain.  Whether this was due to the food or illness of the preparers no way of knowing, but again the lovely light sauce we have experienced in the past came bathed in fat laying and floating on top.  Also the bread was changed from the Italian Bread they use to serve to a small hotdog like bun/roll.  It is a shame to see their prices going up and the food quality declining.  The last time we dined in one of our orders was substituted without advising us, when brought to our waitresses attention she just disappeared and only returned after we completed our meal.  We actually served ourselves refilling our water glasses, coffee, etc from the bar.  Unfortunate to see another establishment go down hill.  Previously enjoyed several occasions and meals here."}
{"text":"Everything was way too spicy. Our server was annoying and over bearing at first and then half way through dinner, she was a ghost. We could've went to a 5 star fancy restaurant for the amount of money we spent here. Never again."}
{"text":"Always drive by this place when you go to the Pineville mall and decided to sign up for the reward club and they sent me a spend 40 get 20 off and a free small pasta dish. Me and my girlfriend went and I got a large pizza and she got a pasta dish and jeeze the small pasta dish was huge! My pizza even huger being a large. If your a sauce lover make sure you order extra sauce on your pizza. Wasn't saucey enough to me. This place is very cool all the pictures on the wall, the wine ceiling and how they walk you threw the kitchen.  There is a table to eat at in the kitchen. If your looking for a cheap meal this could be a bad spot for you. Dishes are pricey but they are family dishes so they come with a lot of food. Would be very good to go with a group. Pasta dishes are between 15-30 dollars. Pizzas are 15-30 dollars as well.  My pizza came with about 18 slices. Lots of leftovers which is always a good thing! Look forward to going again with a group to try all the other pastas. They give you a free thing of bread and pour olive oil in a bowl for you to snack on."}
{"text":"Italiano mmmmm need I say more haha. Actual yea I should. Okay so the waiter told us the portions could feed two or three people, man did we not listen. This was really the case. One small could feed two or even four people. Food was good, service was fast, the servers were great. What else can I say that hasn't been said already?"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat when in Vegas or Hunington Beach. Great salads, pizzas, and deserts. Service has always been good and fast."}
{"text":"So so so disappointed. We went in tonight on Thanksgiving expecting to have a great dinner and experience, but...
Let's start with the good, the food was delicious, well most of it. We started with the calamari and antipasto salad, the salad was absolutely delish,  the calamari was served in a large beer goblet, the top was good, the bottom was unedible, as all the grease settles to the bottom and the calamari was just greasy, the breading was completely gone, therefore it was not crispy deliciousness. We also had the Penne al Forno and the baked rigatoni, both were very very good. We finished with the Italian cream cake, also very good. 
As for the cocktails, the cranberry splash and buca bella was good, the salerno(?) was just ok.
The service was absolutely horrible, I believe our server was Marcus, we had to ask for bread, side plates, olive oil, refills, he only removed 1 thing from the table, the calamari goblet, we had to push everything to the end of the table for him to take , PLUS, we had to ask him to actually clear the table so we could have some elbow room to eat our dessert, he brought the dessert and forks and left, we had to flag him down yet again to get napkins. He never refilled our empty water glasses, or asked if we would like them refilled, just awful. I'm sure he was not happy with the tip, but you get what you actually earn. He was not pleasant, friendly, or engaging in any way.
Go for the food, but if you end up with Marcus, ask to have a different server!!"}
{"text":"Upon entering this establishment, we were greeted with an awful odor. After a few minutes discussing it we came to the conclusion that a bathroom drain somewhere is flowing the wrong way. All this aside we decided to stay and tough it out. Some of the silverware was dirty. The bread was good! The chicken saltimbucco was over cooked and therefore dry. The saving grace was the tiramisu. It was amazing!
Our service was shaky at first but got better.
So check the smell and if u can take it, grab some bread and tiramisu and run! 

Solid 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for dinner. Great server, good food to share. Not my favorite Italian food in the world, but adequate for a nice evening talking with friends.  Try the spicy chicken and Italian cream cake for dessert."}
{"text":"My parents and friends met my husband and I for my birthday dinner here tonight and I was pretty disappointed overall. 

Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait about 10 min to be seated. Not a big deal since there are so many fun things to look at on the wall, though.

We started with some garlic cheese bread that was skimpy on the cheese but pretty good when dipped in the fresh marinara. The small salad was good and enough for feed all 6 of us easily.

My parents ordered a pepperoni pizza, we ordered the steak Milanese and my friends ordered a Quattro formagio pasta dish. We were told several times that are food was only a couple of minutes away until we were finally told that the chef had burned the steak. The pizza came out right after and was very good, but the rest of us still didn't have our food.

The pasta dish came out next and my friend's husband asked what was in the dish because he was a vegetarian and wanted to make sure he knew which items were meat free. The waitress said only one of the items had meat in it but that didn't end up being the case. He even asked again after he tasted sausage in the shells and she said it was only cheese and spinach. After a few minutes she came back to tell us there was chicken sausage in the shells. Too late.

Eventually our steak Milanese came out and it looked delicious with the fresh tomatoes but didn't taste that way. I expected the breading to be crispy and instead it was very soggy. That taste drowned out everything else. I was very disappointed.

The waitress was nice and took the steak off the bill because of the delay but I was overall unimpressed and won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went for my birthday yesterday, and our waiter was simply the sweetest, he answered all our millions of questions about the different kinds of pasta, about what combinations are best, what should we try and he helped my lady surprise me with the entire staff singing and bringing me out dessert. He was so kind and cheerful, the food was warm, great taste, didn't take forever to cook and the icing on the cake was when we left our keys way at the back out the restaurant and he chased after us to bring them out to us. We will be back, the service is great, the food is amazing, great fun and amusing decor, and the staff really just seals the deal on this location. Thanks for a great time!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to dinner at a chian resturant here you go. Let me start by saying I love Coke and this place only has Pepsi so we start off on the wrong foot. The food was good and the atmoshpere is pleasent. If you are looking for the Chilis or Applebees of italian food here you go."}
{"text":"Went in with some friends on a whim. We were very surprised and pleased  by the excellent service and the food was delicious. Will definetly be making this place a regular spot."}
{"text":"We really love this place, such great service and food is always consistently amazing. The Shrimp fra diavolo is our favorite.  The portions are awesome and we never go home without left overs. Only problem is we have to fight over them the next day if they last that long."}
{"text":"Came for Thanksgiving thought it would be nice for a change boy was I wrong made reservations 2 weeks ahead of time was supposed to get kitchen table didn't get it ! Then went to order gnocchi waiter brand new says they don't have ordered a Guinness beer says we have it be right back comes back like 15 minutes later to tell me they don't have.this place used to be good boy did it go down hill ! So disappointed !"}
{"text":"Oh man. Came here on a Saturday night with 7 coworkers on a work trip. We waited in the lobby, for lack of a better term, for literally 10 minutes before a hostess came. There was another party sitting down that looked like they were waiting for the rest of their group to join them - they weren't. They'd literally taken a seat because they'd been there waiting to be seated even longer than us! That's completely unacceptable. From that moment on, I knew this was going to be a shit-show of a dinning experience so I started a timer to record just how awful it really was. It took over 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us and take our drink orders. Amazing! We put in our food orders and almost 46 minutes later got our dinner. The food was decent. Nothing to write home about or return for. All in all, our experience was over an hour and a half. Our drinks were never refilled and the entire customer service experience in that restaurant is deplorable at best. They also walk you through the kitchen on the way to your table. There was shit everywhere and it was filthy to say the  least. See my attached picture of the floor."}
{"text":"Service was very attentive and they handled our party pretty well.  The spinach and warm tomato salad is a much better option than the regular mixed greens.  The creamy pastas are way too heavy for my taste.  Regular spaghetti and meatballs are nothing to rave about.  Pizza is pretty decent and reminds of how they cut pizza at little ceasars.  You will mostly have alot of leftovers to fight over.  The sirah wine is a good paring for most of the pastas there."}
{"text":"I absolutely HATE chain restaurants!

Although in this case, I have to make an exception.  I'm really into the food at Buca.

I used to live in the SF Bay Area, and I had to wait damn near 2 hours to eat at the Buca located at downtown SF.  I now live in Chandler, AZ and the first time I visited a Buca here, I didn't have to wait any longer than 30 seconds.  

I usually have a standard list of items that I order for the entire table when my family goes to Buca:

Bruschetta
Linguine Frutti DiMare
Margherita Pizza
Pepperoni Pizza
Chicken Marsala

I also frequent other independently owned Italian restaurants, but Buca holds a special place in my heart, and my stomach.  They have a signature flavor to their dishes.  

The best waiter in the world, Lee works at this particular one.  Request to be seated at his station and give him a big tip!"}
{"text":"My first time coming it was good the service was friendly the food big and great its a bit pricy but its ok  we had the Colossal sunday and OMG that thing was huge believe it or not me and my husband we eat it all cuz we love ice cream  the only thing that bother me was that i subscribe for emails and that was like 3 months ago and nothing yet."}
{"text":"Do not order a carafe of anything its mostly ice :(
We ordered Rigatoni with meat sauce and it was cold. We ordered dessert and coffee and the coffee was cold. This place is going down hill. 
Forget the little things like putting limes in my sangria and giving us tablespoons to eat our cake. 
I am a little fussy but after we sent the coffee back for being cold we were brought hot coffee and no milk. I asked the waiter for milk and he told me to wait. He had begun to take the order of a party of 14. I called to waiter at this point and said if he planned to take all 14 orders before bringing the milk the coffee would get cold again, never-mind it was not available to have with the cake.
This is really sad"}
{"text":"Food was good. However the service could be better. Our server was pushy, and made us bus our own table before bringing out our entrees. Seriously aren't you suppose clear the table yourself?"}
{"text":"The waitress Dawn gave us the best service everrrr! The food was so delicious and Dawn gave us the best recommendations for what to order. She was so sweet and we will definitely come back again!! :)"}
{"text":"The tiramisu deserves 5 stars.  It was define.

The ambience 4 stars.  Very Italian-esque and at-home feel.  Pictures everywhere.  Some nude or partially nude, if that bothers you.

The food 3 stars.  I've been to at least 3 other Bucca's in my life and this one just don't compare to the others.  It was good.  The pasta was al dente like it should be and the meatball nice and soft but the rest of the food I thought was just OK.  The green beans were way too crunchy for my taste.  We also got some kind of pruscetto (sp?) stuffed chicken which I thought was way salty but I think that's what pruscetto is right?  Salted meat?  

Service was OK.  We got bumped around from waiter to waiter (actually, I think one of them was a bartender).  I like continuity!  He did hook us up with some extra bread so kudos for that.

Overall, I think we come here mainly for the tiramisu.  As far as meals go, we can probably get it elsewhere for cheaper (it's just 2.5 of us so family meals are much for us - both quantity and price) but every once in a while, we get that hankering for tiramisu.  YUM."}
{"text":"Waiter was awesome! Experience was fun but highly overpriced for what you get! Everything was good, but honestly I feel like I could make this in my kitchen. Some may like that aspect, but I didn't care too much for it! Huge place! Great location!"}
{"text":"I had my best friend's baby shower here and I first dealt with Ashley Newcomer when I was organizing the shower and deciding what I was going to do. She was so great and answered all 5000 questions I had. She made sure to accommodate everything I requested! On day of we had Amy as our server and she was amazing! I can't emphasize enough how helpful, calm and attentive she was. The staff at this location is so friendly I can't speak highly enough about these 2 and everyone else that helped. I would definitely have my next gathering here as well as eating at this location when I'm craving a delicious Italian meal ;)."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with out dinner last night. I had come with a group of 16 people. The server looked overwhelm which was fine. But we had ordered around 8:50 and our dinner came our exactly at 10. It was ridiculous! No manager no one came up to us to let us know about anything. The first time I came there I loved it! And came back for my birthday and was just a huge disappointment! Never again."}
{"text":"My family of six came here for dinner and it took way longer than necessary to get a server to our table. It took at least 15 minutes to just get water to the table. Our service became better through the night. The food was amazing and the portions were huge. By the end of our meal, we realized we had not gotten bread for the table. We had to use the same plates that we ate our appetizer and salad on to eat our main course."}
{"text":"visit Oct 1 as part of a wedding...
First time here,always wanted to try it. Have always been a big fan of Olive garden, so ere it goes....

Portions are freaking huge...One small plate can definitely feed two people and maybe even have leftovers!
Everything I ate and drank was free so here is what I sampled:
Fried calamari+baby octopi   A
Caprese (always a fan)   A
Caesar salad (nothing spectacular) B-
Prosciutto Chicken (fricken amazing) A+
Rigatoni (less than stellar) C
didn't try the spaghetti
desert variety plate:
strawberry cheesecake (good,but I've had better) B+
Chocolate decadence (great, but a little dry) A
Tiramisu   A

My drink was house Chardonnay, and it was great

Based on my free experience, I would definitely go again, and this time try something with lobster or more garlic :D

I might also mention that up until that day I had just completed a 5 week straight 500 calorie a day diet, and this was my breaking point-free food. SO I enjoyed myself thoroughly.
Hope your experience is as good!
Bon Apetito"}
{"text":"Buca is a household name in Italian dining so I don't really even need to tell you that the food here was amazing... you should already know that by now. But the service here was incredible and deserves 10 stars (too bad those don't exist here). Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Such amazing food! Our waiter Alex was so good/ esp patient with all the crazy kids we came with!"}
{"text":"My cousin hosted his wedding reception there and we all had a great time. The appetizers were solid and the ambiance in the back area they had for us was really nice. It was a little odd having a ton of other diners around where we were celebrating their wedding, but you really didn't have a lot of interaction with them over the course of the night.

Food was excellent. Because of the length of the reception the main dishes had cooled slightly when they brought them out but that did not dampen our spirits at all. Drinks were good -- I got a few cocktails but they were mostly gingler ale and not much Whiskey. But all in all, I think they hosted our group really well."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with menu variety, portions, price and service. I was not expecting such good food for a chain restaurant. No comparison to the Olive Garden. I highly suggest the Penne San Remo. They use family style for the entrees. Two small entrees more than enough for three people. Take this into consideration before adding on appetizers, breads and salads."}
{"text":"My friends and I had been drinking quite a bit over the weekend and were just really wanting a hearty meal.   We stopped in and had to wait about 15 minutes but then were ushered to a table.   The menu had great items to select from but it was a bit uncomfortable when one friend didnt want what everyone else wanted. This is FAMILY STYLE so you get one dish or two to share with everyone.

We had a delicious salad - cant remember the name but it had pancetta and it was delicious.  We had baked rigatoni as well.  It was more than enough for all of us.  With a drink each we paid around 30 a piece. So, it isnt more affordable to eat family style and it could be a pain if you have a group of people with very different taste buds but it turned out ot be an ok experience for us and the food and service were both pretty good."}
{"text":"While I AM a snob when it comes to chain restaurants - generally HATE them - and am a champion of the locally owned business, I actually enjoy eating at Buca Di Beppo at Station Square. I haven't an ounce of shame about this. Eating here is FUN. 

The decor is Italian-American kitsch on crack - every nook, cranny, and square inch of wall space is filled with some fabulously tacky knickknack, souvenir, gilt reproduction of Michelangelo's David, vintage family photo, or 8 x 10 glossy of Gina Lollobrigida and Connie Francis. And, honestly, any restaurant that has a table with a rotating head of the pope as its centerpiece can serve me a TV dinner in a tin tray and I'll be THRILLED. 

The food is better than that, though. It's not the best Italian food in town, or even the second or third best, but it's good enough. Entrees are served family style, so you have to share, and that's part of the fun too. 

It's super-crowded on the weekends, but if you can get a group together some week night, I promise it'll be good times. Service is s-l-o-w, so get comfortable and have another glass of wine."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now and both servers that I had were absolutely wonderful! The food always has a great taste and the wait for it is never long. My best advice is to go during their lunch hour. The food is better priced and it is just as good! Dinner pricing is a bit overwhelming and I understand that it is served in big portions for a family but honestly our dinner price came down to about $32 per person and we felt that was a little much for what it was. Other than pricing being a bit heavy on the wallet everything else was great!"}
{"text":"The apple gorgonzola salad is delicious. The chicken in the spicy chicken rigatoni was very bland and tasted rubbery.  The strawberry fusion was very refreshing and added a nice surprise to the meal. The bread was cols and the waitress poured the oil and vinegar awkward.  The service sucked and it took forever to get the waitress attention. She didnt look like she wanted to be there and was less than satisfactory."}
{"text":"comida estupenda, el mejor restaurante italiano de las vegas. todo fenomenal salvo una cosa, el aire acondicionado estaba a tope, parecía el polo norte!!"}
{"text":"It's a fun atmosphere. And the help is super-friendly. Don't be in a hurry. And although the food isn't bad, nothing was remarkable. Prices are very reasonable. And the family style allows everyone to taste each item. Best things were actually the Bruschetta and the veggies. Meatballs were a hit, and many liked the sausage. Buca is more of a place to enjoy your large group of people over dinner. But if you are looking for great food, there are better choices."}
{"text":"I have no idea why so many people give this restaurant bad reviews. My family has eaten here about a dozen time in the past year and we have always had a good time. Very good food, good service, and even discounts if you sign up at BucaLove.com that will make you want to come back time and again!"}
{"text":"Shortly after my negative review here on Yelp!, Buca corporate contacted me in Yelp mail to get my contact info to discuss my experience.

Contact info was provided and no one has contacted me.

This is about as spot on as the dining experience...  Fail..."}
{"text":"Into Buca di Beppo for many years. Had several occasions and fun. My last visit will be my last visit. I ordered eggplant Parmesan that was awful it was cold it was tough. The only thing that saved the evening was the server he was very Nice. His name was Dray. The quality of the food has change so much. I won't be returning. It was cold and it was tough. It felt like it was just thrown on the plate.The only star today was the waiter. But the quality of the food was not very good. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went on Mother's Day Weekend (Saturday) without a reservation, which my girlfriend and I definitely regretted. We arrived at a bit before 6:00pm and were told that it would be a 45 minute wait. Not a big deal since we knew about the holidays and possible dinner reservations ahead of us, but we were only a group of two. We're finally seated at about 7:50pm on the second floor in a corner booth. We were greeted first by a manager and then by our waitress who were both very pleasant. Overall, the night went okay after we were seated. By the time we left it was 8:45pm. 

Once we were seated: 
We were only brought one complimentary bread and our drinks were only refilled once. Most of the night our waitress was missing completely. I had to ration out my beverage until she returned but we ended up just wanting to leave by the time we saw her. Also, the men's bathroom on the second floor was disgusting and needed to be cleaned ASAP. 

Food: 
We would highly recommend the Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken! We also had the Spicy Shrimp appetizer and Quattro al Forno (stuffed shells and such), which were just fine."}
{"text":"Went in last night (thursday)  to have a drink.  Around 8:30.  The bar was empty, riddled with dirty dishes and also dirty bar top.  Waited and waited. No one in site to wait on us.  Horrible way to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst Buca in the history of Buca di Beppo!

I have been to many Bucas and this place is definitely the worst. I don't mind the pricing point of this restaurant if it lives to its standard. This location has been giving me bad impression of the Buca Corporation. We ordered Supremo Pizza, Lasagna, Chicken Marsala, Chicken Parmigiana, Prosciotto Chicken, and Calamari.  I had a party of five celebrating a birthday. We were seated at the chef's table per our request and was utterly surprised that the place was empty on a Sunday night. Typically, when we go to Buca, we would need to reserve it far in advance in other places. I have to say this was a warning sign! A dead empty place, full of servers, but no customers. Anyways, we are able to see how the chef works and how the business was run by seating at the chef's table. When we were about to order, one of the chef has to re-do the order the third time because the fettuccine sauce was too watery, apparently the ratio was off when they made the batch, so the server kept coming back to the kitchen. After the third request to re-do, the server got pissed at the chef, then the chef just threw tantrums and left the kitchen. The manager at this Buca was fairly new and was unable to keep the situation in the kitchen under control. I was hoping that I didn't had to take our food back to the kitchen, since we were literally seated in front of the kitchen. 

Lasagna was the worst here! It tastes like a frozen lasagne where the cheese crumbles easily. It was overcooked as well and dry as heck. I do not think it was the same recipe as other lasagna at other Bucas. What is worst is the manager also defended the chef that it tastes as good as other Bucas. I think the manager should get training on how to handle customer complaints and rectify the problem, instead of being defensive. 

I highly do not recommend this place. I would recommend going somewhere local, mom and pops, and high traffic. I would have been worried coming here, knowing that the place is dead. 

Apparently, I was not the only dissatisfied with the food here. There were two other tables complaining about the pizza and the food."}
{"text":"This place is always on point! I make it a point to not go to \"chain\" style Italian restaurants, but I make an exception when it comes to Buca... everything here is fresh and family sized!"}
{"text":"This is an UPDATE on January 21, 2011, to my earlier reveiw that follows below.

After the terrible experience we had on Thanksgiving, I wrote the Buca de Beppo corporate headquarters and sent them a copy of this review.

I was frankly surprised to receive a personal reply from the company's Regional Director.

In addition to apologizing for the bad experience, she refunded the money we paid for our Thanksgiving dinner and sent us a gift card asking that we give them a second chance.

While there was no excuse for the issues we encountered last Thanksgiving at the Mesa location, the parent company clearly cares about their customers so if you have a problem, WRITE THE COMPANY and you might be pleasantly surprised.

As for our return visit, took my dad there for his birthday and we had an OK time... not as good as I remember, but still enjoyable.
***************************************************************************
Review for 11/25/10

2 or 3 years ago, we'd have rated Buca a good solid 3-4 stars for value, but my oh my how low they have fallen.

I don't often rant about a restaurant unless I feel completely taken advantage of. That said, here I go.

Ordered the Turkey Feast for Thanksgiving because in the past Buca always represented a good value. 

HA WHAT A JOKE!  Their use of the word Feast borders on deceptive advertising. 

A \"Feast\" as defined by Webster:

a : an elaborate and usually abundant meal often accompanied by a ceremony or entertainment : banquet 
b (1) : something that gives unusual or abundant enjoyment

They should be calling it a Turkey appetizer, but before I expound further, I want to explain that my wife and I usually share an entree, so you'll know neither of us is a big eater. We went to Buca because we expected to have lots of leftovers over the weekend. NOT

Buca claims it can feed 3 but I could have eaten the six (6) MINISCULE, REHEATED, COOL slices of white meat and 4 tablespoons of dressing by myself. What a RIP-OFF for $24.95!!

The extra side of salad was missing the usual pepperocini (only contained 1) so we had to request some on the side.

The baked Rigatoni pasta was DRY, DRY, STICK IN YOUR THROAT DRY and we had to request extra suace.

And let's not forget the bread... whoever currently orders this for Buca doesn't know the meaning of Italian bread. What they served wasn't much more firm than Wonder bread and certainly a far cry from REAL, Crusty, Coarse Italian bread like you find at Brio, Maggianos or any other restaurant with Italian roots. You can find better Italian bread at COSTCO than at this place... in fact, they'd make a huge improvement in the authenticity of the meal by getting their bread from COSTCO instead of the bakery they are using.

And yes, we could have sent all the food back, but we decided to be Thankful for our ability to go out and enjoy a beautiful day, as well as not cause a scene in the restaurant and spoil anyone else's enjoyment of the holiday. Our response instead  will be to never visit one of their restaurants again.

PLEASE do yourself and your family a favor by avoiding Buca de Beppo at all costs. This company should be out of business so something better could fill the space.

Go to your local Italian restaurant, run by a local family, rather than this corporate theme restaurant that has forgotten the quality and value that made them famous in the beginning.

If we could rate ZERO stars we'd have done so."}
{"text":"This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants where I live back home and I have the opportunity to use a $20 off coupon at this location over the weekend. The bar service was extremely slow considering there was only two other people besides my party of three sitting at the bar, but maybe we just were there on an odd night. The five cheese white pizza is an all-time favorite, and during happy hour the Italian margarita is a bonus. They make it with amaretto which is a nice bonus. The food took quite a while to arrive to us and we were starving, but I guess you can't complain when you are using a coupon and taking advantage of all the happy hour drink specials. Overall, the food and the portions here are so great that it is very hard to find something to actually complain about."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here and the second time the food was amazing. The service though... not so much, table behind me walked out because it took so long for server to take their drink order and she came to my table 1st. I tried warning server that the other table has been waiting but she ran into the kitchen. After 1 he and 20 minutes our server (Zane) came to tell us that we will get a complimentary desert for our food taking over a hr to be cooked. I then asked if there was any bread, and Zane told me they were cooking new batch. He came out told me that the bread was fresh out the oven. It was hard a cold. He lied... food was great service was horrible... 3/5 only because of the food."}
{"text":"The food was good. The spicy ckn penne with the rosa sauce was delicious. The staff had great customer service and the food came out very fast and fresh. It looked appeasing and the taste was bold."}
{"text":"Like this place.. family style.. huge portions... But... You know..ONE thing sticks out like a sore thumb.. the bread. The bread sucks ass. Cold.. baguette type bread, right out of a bag someplace... ONE thing would turn good into great.. .. ok two things.. if a party shows up and has more than 3 kids younger than 12, they should be seated in a section with other families like that.. I know.. crotchety old man, but I think that we're at 6 back and forth trips around the table by a 6 year ikd young lady the is determined to punch a hike in the floor evidently.. and her Mom's call of Anisa, sit down.. doesn't seem to have any effect whatsoever.. this is occurring in unison with the boys cries of \"get off me!\"  Service was excellent.. good was great..  please.. for the love of God.. fix the bread."}
{"text":"I've had Bucca in the past and it was way better than what I was served tonight. I ordered the cheesy garlic bread and chicken stuffed with prosciutto to go.  There was no plasticware included in the bag, the cheesy garlic bread barely had cheese on it and tasted undercooked, the bread that they normally include did not come with any butter or oil for dipping, lastly, I found what looked like black plastic shavings in the chicken. I'm not sure what is going on with this location but I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"Ok. So I have to say, food was not that bad, even though the first bottle of wine was bad and the B-Day cake was horrible. The service on the other hand was a 100% disappointment. We made reservations to have my B-Day dinner celebration here at this location closest to my house. I will never ever, ever step foot in this location, ever again. Unless the service personnel is rearranged. Front desk personnel were great. The waiters on the other hand are by far the most unprofessional unproductive in their field. Only reason we didn't get up and leave, was because I had lots of family members already sitting at the table and it would have been hard to book somewhere else for a big party like that on last minute notice. So we tried to make it as good as possible,, BECAUSE IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But no matter what, these people were just not there. A few of my family members complained to me about how rude and careless they felt the waiters were. Even with my really bad dinner experience at this place, waiters still received a very generous tip,, not because they deserved it, but because we do what's right. Will not recommend nor take someone to eat here. Poor management."}
{"text":"The food is very expensive for what you get, cold when it arrived to our table. We all had very high expectations and we were not pleased all not even with the service.  We weren't greeted by a host etc. Will most definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"The Italians would shoot themselves. Frankly, it is mediocre at best. Could have given them a better review if the waitress was a little better at explaining what she meant when she asked us if we wanted some bread... we said yes and then when the bill came, it was $7.99!  Really? I find it interesting that she failed to mention that this was not a complimentary basket of bread- how convenient.  

Might as well go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"If I could have given this location less than a 1 I would have.. I had made a reservation for 6pm for my sister's birthday. We came in early to get set up and yet we waited almost 30 minutes.. no apologies and the staff was rude. I was so upset that we tried to make this a special day for my sister and this turned out this way. Had I known I would have never come here. Even after they sat us down our waitress was no where to be found"}
{"text":"Bad service, food was cold, and very expensive. Don't visit this restaurant, many many restaurants in the area, all better than Buca di Beppo. No bread for 30 minutes and was cold. No napkins, brought olive oil, but no Vinegar for at least 15 minutes. Charged for entree not ordered ($29). Ordered linguini with seafood, was cold to the touch. Had to returned one entree because too cold. Visited the restaurant at around 4:00pm, few customers and still couldn't give decent service. Complained to manger, he did nothing except correct the check. I'll never go there again and I recommend you visit any other dining establishment should you think about visiting this highly advertised restaurant."}
{"text":"Very impressed at this location! I've been to a few Bucca Di Beppo restaurants when I lived in California and the food was always so bland and not pleasing. This location was awesome! Everything was well seasoned and tasted better than most italian restaurants around charlotte. Our waitress was very friendly and fast. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I live in Las Vegas and this is my go-to restaurant. It is the perfect restaurant for large groups of family or friends, or both! There are a couple Bucca's in the Las Vegas area, but my family likes the one located in the Excalibur. The staff is friendly and are accommodating. The food is the best part, though. You get large portions of delicious Italian food.I have a young son that loves the Spaghetti with Meatballs and he is typically a picky eater. This is a great place to take your family and enjoy delicious Italian food... A must for all!"}
{"text":"They say are authentic italian...but really you can't trick a real italian like me on this food.
We got spaghetti meatsauce and them seemed clearly  canned to me and mixed with a lot of marinara. Also the noodles were watering and overcooked.
Quantity ok but quality not..."}
{"text":"The food is good and plentiful.  It's served family style in large dishes. Nothing special about the menu, on par with Macaroni Grill or Carrabba's. The service was a little slow, especially from the bar."}
{"text":"We ordered one of their large salads to go a few weekends ago, and it was fantastic!  We brought it to a potluck dinner with friends.  For the insanely huge size and great quality, the price was right.  It was also made very quickly.  I highly recommend checking out their menu for a meal to go!"}
{"text":"Over priced fast food quality child size portions. I never leave reviews online about restaurants but this place compelled me to reach out to the public consumer. I left one star on my rating that goes out to the silver fox who sereved us she was nice polight and funny I want her to know she does a great job. But the food is a major problem. I paid for two people tonight and I could have bought dinner for six people at Stieners and the quality of food would still be much better. My tab was $70.00 for two 5 oz mixed drinks that cost 20.00 one of the smallest chewiest burnt orders of calamari for $15.00 and a two person serving size portion of veal that sucked so small 3 tiny pieces of veal with no pasta on the side for $27.00. I was insulted with this meal. I hope my tab helps keep you in business just long enough to change your old fashioned cash grab ways. I will never return to this restaurant so long as I live and if your a patron who enjoys real italian food look up Capos on Sahara. You'll spend the same but you'll have an amazing experience. The only way I would remove this post is they refunded me for half of my tab. I honestly felt we only consumed $35.00 worth in food"}
{"text":"ok.. ok... I know what your thinking, 1 star?  Buca... its based on service alone.

The server we had, first was not attentive, the place was dead, towards closing, seemed more interested in helping close the place than his customers.  His BREATHE STUNK, yeah, its hard to imagine it be that bad that the whole table can smell it.

He \"forgot\" my beer, and then lied about it.  The salad came out and was finished before the bread go there.  Extra olives ordered never arrived. 

And lets face it, Buca is not a good value.  3 folks, salad and dish runs $55? 

Yes, the food is good, no doubt about it.  But based on the repeated bad service I have had at this location, they either need to fire the idiot that keeps hiring these rejects or just find something else to do."}
{"text":"As i'm writing this review, I am currently sitting in the bar area which people seem to hate based on previous reviews. I can see why. I've been here for an hour and have only received my appetizer. Waiting on the rest of my food is making me sleepy. Our server is nowhere to be found and this place is dead. Not a very pleasant experience so far. And ps, my water has been empty this entire time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian food. Saturday 9-17 was my Birthday and we had the best server ever, his name was Shane he was so polite and kept coming to our table to see if we needed anything else. My friend told him it was my Birthday and he did offer if I wanted them to sing to me and I said no Thank You, anyways we were getting ready to leave and I was putting the one piece of bread in the container he gave us and he offer me more bread and I thought that was so sweet of him to do that, then he came back and gave me a little Birthday Cake for my Birthday that just touched my heart for him to go out of his way. And thanks to Shane that was the only Birthday cake I had. 
I will never forget this day because of Shane. We need more people like him. 
And of course the food was Superb. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great value, good food and good service. An island of sanity surrounded by a sea of over priced Vegas crap.  Had some pasta and a beer.   Mmmmm"}
{"text":"My niece selected Buca for her birthday meal, so we were happy to take her. We took the tour through the kitchen on the way to our table, nice touch. Our waitress was super friendly and willing to answers our questions patiently.

Family style dining is fun, probably more so with a larger group to share with. We ordered a side dish of Alfredo for our niece because she couldn't eat a whole dish alone and neither my husband or I care for Alfredo ourselves. We decided to share the Quattro al Forno with ravioli, canneloni, manicotti and stuffed shells. We ordered a small, which states it is for 2-3 people to share. Hmm. Not sure I am buying that. It was a pretty small portion in my opinion for the money and the price. It was good, but not great. Chicken canneloni was my favorite.  The hubby ordered a meatball on the side and while it was big, he said it lacked the ooomph he was hoping for. Bummer.

We would go back with a group, but probably not on our own. I rounded up a 3.5 trip due to the great staff and eclectic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ate great pizza today. Probably best to visit as a group so you can share more food.
Nice service.
Decoration is stereotypical italian. But hey, it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"We always have great service and great food at Buca! We went there on Friday and had a great experience from the moment we walked in the door. The host was very friendly and we had a wonderful server named Donna. She was great!! Very inventive and made sure we were satisfied with everything at all times."}
{"text":"We had the most delightful, filling meal made better by our fabulous server, Jarrett!  Highly recommend and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken Alfredo  which was very good along with very good  caesars salad . The service was great."}
{"text":"The one thing about playing college basketball that I liked (other than the scholarship) was the delicious food you got to eat on road trips. This place is a prime example. Our entire team, plus coaching staff and trainers, ate here when we were in Vegas to play UNLV. 
     I should first say that I believe myself to be a bit of a connoisseur of Italian food, seeing that it was Italian food that we ate on almost every road trip; so when I say that this place was good, it means that it was better than some (but not all) of the best Italian spots in the Western U.S.                  
     The food was delicious, and I should know, I think we ordered everything on the menu after we robbed the Rebels with a buzzer-beater three pointer. I can't quite pin down my favorite dish, though I can say the the bread was amazing. 
     Considering 20-some odd people were eating together, I think that the service was excellent, and the decor kept me entertained when I wasn't staving off the forks and hands of my teammates who were vying for my plate of food. 
     Overall I would recommend this place for anyone who has the cash for a fun night on the town.
     Go Gauchos!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Family style with large portions, especially on the pasta. Prices are good, average for Italian food. Not five stars because service wasn't great but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok Italian food, portions are big, but you pay for them. Kind of expensive for what you get. Service was ok, birthday dessert was a bowl of whipped cream. Expected more for 150 bucks for 4 people ."}
{"text":"I love love love Buca Di Bepo!   So,  since I don't have one in the area I live at, i decided to eat here.  I feel the service we received was ok.  Food took longer than usual.  The pizza came first, then chicken parmesan came out 7 minutes later.  I feel it should have came out together.  

As I went to the bathroom there is a little area the servers go in to the left.  Lol! There was a waiter and waitress kissing---not a hello kiss either! Wtf?? Professionalism people!!  Not the best place to show PDA,  I'm glad my 5 year old didn't see it!  

Not the best Buca I've been to, but, hey, it's all about Management and how they manage people and the restaurant."}
{"text":"Two is being generous.  
5 stars for the server with the longer hair and beard who really did his best with what he was given.

Food is expensive, and coming from the N.E part of the country with a great Italian food scene: this food is crap. 
-generous portions of cold bread and cold food 
-brought my pizza out 25 min before my other parties food. Literally 25 min. (1) dish out of a party of 7.
-bartender screwed up a light margarita for a reg. one. Seemingly no big unless you are a diabetic, which someone in our party was. The server (who was great) and the manager were very apologetic and concerned. 

I doubt this location will be here in 10 years. I'm sad to relay this: Olive Garden is better. Ouch, that really hurt to type. 
If your in Scottsdale just follow the other Yelp reviews to a better Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I love buca, its our go to for family and friends dinner but this location it took more than an hour to get our dinner served...maybe the server is swamped but its at 5 the dinner rush has not even started yet.. I dont know the reason behind it but i was truly disappointed with the service maybe because we were hungry."}
{"text":"The portions are huge and the food is very good but pricey. Everything is a la carte. Service is super slow"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhh Bucca.....I had such HIGH expectations for you! 

Having attended several large parties at Buca di Beppo I didn't hesitate to book my fiance's birthday party for him and 20 of his closest friends. I was impressed with the banquet manager, Anthony, who helped set up our menu and made suggestions regarding serving size and what to order. He was super helpful and accommodating, calling to offer various seating options and confirming our party in advance. If ONLY he had set the tone for out evening!! 

The good: The food was good. Yes, it is a chain, and the food reflects that. But our caprese, fried cheese, stuffed mushrooms, etc, they were delicious. Everyone LOVED the chicken parm and the pasta was great....and the red wine sangria was fabu! 

Attention to mistakes was great. Our server noticed we had been delivered a small app when I ordered a large when I didnt actually realized that......she comp'd the small and sent the large out. 

The management was good. Yes, I got to meet management! Super duper....allow me to detail the BAD. 

The room we were in was ODD. Imagine a long table placed in a room that was literally only 2 feet wider than the actual table on 3 sides. It was like the bat cave of dining rooms. All of the food had to be served from one end, which was kind of an issue with the gigantic hot bowls of steaming pasta. Add to the fact that part of the room doubled as the drink station/serving computers and it was a pretty busy place. 

Speed. My sister arrived early to greet guests and had to hunt down a server to order her drink after waiting 20 minutes. Literally. Hunt. Down. I arrived with the birthday boy and ALSO waited 15 for drinks. Water, soft drinks etc all took empty glasses and special requests for refills. The wait between appetizers and dinner was tremendous (ly odd). They served our green beans 5 minutes after we finished our apps but then the meal came 20 minutes later. WTF? 

Service. I already mentioned this a bit but if you're still reading you might care about the details. Our server was clearly overworked. I'm not sure how many other tables she had in the restaurant but when you're serving a table of 14-20 I would assume they would be minimal....not in this case apparently. People at the end of our table (GUESTS) ended up busing our dishes. A bus boy eventually showed up to help clear and literally took a plate away from a guest with the fork half way to her mouth. Yes.....SHE WAS STILL EATING! 

Our waitress brought out dishes for the cake which I appreciated since I hadnt purchases Buca's B-day cake and sometimes restaurants get weird about that. She left for a few minutes and shortly thereafter one of my guests overheard her complaining about how horrible our table was!!!!!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY??????? I pretty much lost my temper at that point and ended our meal prematurely. While waiting for management I overheard not one, but TWO other servers complain about their tables (as I mentioned we were seated in the drink station area.....so I guess they were breakin' it down in there). 

Management was extremely apologetic and polite although he obviously had doubts about my complaints. I'm going to choose to believe his doubts were related to his staff having an 'off' night as they are usually totally awesome? And to be honest I was soooooo angry by this point I wasnt able to detail the majority of my issues. There were certainly moments of greatness (ie the appetizer issue) when they demonstrated an understanding of good service. They took care of a large percentage of our check (which I wasn't expecting) but I completely appreciated since I had set up a cash bar and in our rush to depart ended up being an 'open bar' on me :-( 

I wouldn't recommend this Buca unless you knew the server or management and were ensured a good time. As a former server I understand the stress of waiting on large parties, but still expect the style of service afforded to smaller tables. I really did appreciate the effort management made to appease our complaints but simply wish we could have skipped the entire drama. And as I mentioned, the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great service by Kurt Awesome food and atmosphete for hungry boys"}
{"text":"Didn't go to our usual place on Lake Mead they were booked soild, so we went to the one on E. Flamingo. Ordered the same thing everytime Linguine Frutti di Mare. This time I was very unhappy with the sause not spicy at all. Don't know if it was the cook or what but the manager had them make a new one, wish I didn't do that. Vomit the whole night. Not going there again I'll stick to my usual place on Lake Mead."}
{"text":"Thank you MIKE for a fantastic dinner. Everyone knows its family style but the portions are really generous.  I ordered off the GLUTEN FREE MENU and the chicken was delicious! The dessert platter was huge!! It had 4 pieces of cake and we couldn't finish it between 4 of us. Ask for MIKE when you go- he is sooo nice and explains all the ingredients perfect."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing dining experience. We ordered 3 family portions of 3 different dishes. We had to send back the fettuccine because the noodles were so over cooked. The spaghetti and meatballs were very bland. The only dish we liked was the chicken dish. 
When we wanted the fettuccine boxed up to go, the waitress said she was going to have us do it because they were having issues with hair getting into the food when they boxed it up in the kitchen. She went on and on about it. Completely ruined our meal. All 7 of us left saying that Buca used to be good, but this would be our last dining experience there."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and the service has been fun - but today, the hostess was very un inviting. I waited up front longer than usual, was never greeted with a smile, then was expected (rather asked) to follow her through the kitchen as she walked (quickly) and pointed at things and mumbled whatever they were. The actual lunch service and waitress was fine - but, if it was based on first impressions - I would have walked out."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! This location is not in a good safe area. Vehicle was broken into and lost everything! Cops were called, never showed up (last day of NFR). Restaurant offered no helping assistance. Experience at restaurant was ok, but they need to perhaps offer some type of security...cameras, a person patrolling the parking lot, something."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the bad service reviews are about. We come here a lot and our service is always wonderful. The servers are friendly and always suggest drinks and menu items and they're really great with our daughter. 
I highly suggest the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and the Chicken Parm and the Margherita Pizza... and..........the Fettucini Supremo.
The portions are huge, so if we have a 4 or 5 people, we usually order 3 or 4 small dishes and still leave with left overs. 

 I'm a huge fan of Buca and will always come back regardless of the location."}
{"text":"Here's a update. The corporate manager contacted me and send me a $50 gift certificate. I took my wife and mother and father in law (there Italian). Service was good and the waiter was on point. The food was great and the whole experience was excellent. Feeling good about the dinner and would recommend the restaurant to my friends. This second chase was great food and service. Thank you we will be returning to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"We ate here because we felt like Italian food.  We had a salad and the spaghetti and meatballs.  They are served in family style (large portions).

The chopped antipasto salad was good.  The spaghetti and meatballs were adequate.  I wouldn't say delicious but it was acceptable spaghetti.

The waitress was friendly and helpful.

The limoncello was amazingly delicious.

I'd go here again.  It isn't cheap. It isn't great.  But for the strip and Italian, it was good and acceptable."}
{"text":"First time at this place and today happens to be my birthday... I love this place!  Food taste is excellent, the portion is big, the price is just right, the ambience is nice and the best part is the service -- it's superb and particularly the server Stewart he did excellent job as I watched him serve me and other customers.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place only 2 stars since the food was actually pretty good, but everything else was just so wrong.  
Most of all the service was terrible.  We had a waitress that was training another waiter.  You would think that would make our service exceptional.  The service was incredibly slow, not only from our wait staff, but from the kitchen.  The couple that ordered 15 minutes after us got their food at the same time.  No apologies of course.  Just a big old 15 minute wait between the bill and them actually collecting the money.  
What really annoyed me was while we were waiting for our food the wait staff approached us to join their online discount club.  Really?  You couldn't give that to us with our bill?  How about a \"so sorry your food has taken over 30 minutes\"?  
In addition to that, I just personally do not care for the decor.  Every inch of the place is covered with photographs and grandma-like decor.  
The garlic bread however was amazing. 
Also be aware that this is a family style restaurant.  Do go with someone that shares your culinary tastes.  The small dishes easily serve 3 maybe even 4 if you get a starter."}
{"text":"This review is for the catering/events department, not for the restaurant itself. I am in the process of planning a birthday party for my husband's birthday. I was looking into various restaurants to host a party with hor dourves, drinks, ect. The person form the catering called me and immediately gave me bad vibes - not friendly and valley-girl accent. After discussing prices, I told her that I thought Buca would be out of our price-range for the type of party I was trying to accomplish. She proceeded to ask me what my budget was. Keep in mind, I am paying for the entire party and guests will not be buying their own food. When I told her my \"small\" budget, her valley-girl response was \"Ouch\"! And then she seemed very annoyed and short with me for the rest of our short conversation. This is not how you keep returning customers. Just because my budget for this particular event was low, it does not mean that future events that I host, won't have a much higher budget. Hire someone more friendly and down to earth please. I am tired of the Scottsdale snobbery."}
{"text":"Understandably, the restaurant was very busy so I tried takeout. They couldn't do a pizza with \"custom\" toppings because \"they use different sauces\". Come on! This isn't what I call top rated customer support. Sorry guys, I'll avoid Di Beppo's in future visits."}
{"text":"I'm by no means a restaurant snob, nor am I an expert. I've had carry-out and dine-in numerous times from this restaurant. We've never had a problem dining here. The food is always great and consistent over time, so is the service. 

This location is not without it's flaws but our overall experience here over two years now is consistently very good. We'll continue to return again and again and we tip well for the excellent waitstaff.

The concept here is this is 'family style' dining. In plain English this means they make one large serving setting it on the table for everyone to serve themselves from. There are very few single person sized choices on the menu. I would always order with the plan of taking food home for leftovers.

Some favorites for us are their meatballs, ceasar salad and spaghetti with meat sauce. The meatballs here are a meal in themselves, they're larger than a baseball.

This is one of the few restaurants I've been to that I would say this but Thank You Buca for over two years of excellent service and great food.

I tried signing up for the email service but the volume of offers in my email was way too much so I cancelled it. Most of the discounts offered were for things I'd never get on days I could never go so it was mostly a waste of my time."}
{"text":"Went there today, New Year's eve to pick up an over the phone order. When we arrived, our food was not ready yet. Understandable, it's new Year's eve After all. 
What got me so upset was when my friend asked the kitchen personnel if our food is ready after we heard him tell  a person who came after us that their order is going out next. My friend asked if our order is almost ready and a bald guy with tattoos in the kitchen responded: \"What!?!?! I don't know, I only know about her order cuz hers is a lot!\" WTH!!! So in other words, he does not care about our order or any other person's order for that matter because ours is not as many as the other person's? I got upset because we're all paying customers, small orders or not. We decided to take our business to them instead of another establishment during one of the busiest evenings of the year and this is the treatment that we get?!?!?!! This man is so rude and unprofessional, I don't even know why he's still working there. 

The food is good but the service that we got from this place is very unsatisfactory and unprofessional that the bad taste of the service resonated to the food. 

I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT EVER AGAIN AND NOR DO I RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION TO OTHERS. I WILL CERTAINLY NOT BRING FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO VISIT FROM OUT OF STATE HERE."}
{"text":"Great food close to home. Much rather grab the small spaghetti to go than make it at home. Be sure to ask for to go plates to save doing dishes because you will be full and satisfied no matter what you try."}
{"text":"We had Paula as a waitress and we were not let down she was punctual and a joy to be around just a very cheerful person which made our experiance that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ok, so i don't leave Yelp reviews but feel I need to.  This place is like the Walmart of restaurants apparently.  I took my girlfriend to dinner because it was near by and we had never tried it and I received a gift card from a friend.  Walk in, tell us its a 30 minute wait (no big deal because we didn't have reservations).  Go to the bar while waiting to get a drink.  Took the bartender about 5 minutes to even get near me enough before I could ask him how his night was because he clearly wasn't going to greet us, and there was only 2 other people at the bar.  Order a glass of wine and a mixed drink and it seemed like we were asking him to make some crazy concoction and not the sangria we ordered.  FYI, he clearly hates his job.  We transfer our tab to our table as we got seated.  Fast forward another 10 minutes before we flag someone down to wait on us.  We ordered caprese appetizer (all raw ingredients, nothing needed to be cooked) yet took 20 minutes to come out.  We order our meal which the waitress (who started out very nice and friendly) told us that would come out fast.  Unfortunately not the case.  She apologized multiple times for it taking so long and ended up taking $10 off our tab for the delay (very nice of them).  Service was mediocre at best.  Food was so-so.  Overall atmosphere looked like they googled \"Italian\" on the internet and printed every picture that came up on google images.  Way too cluttered.  Took another 10 minutes just to run the check.  When the entire meal was over, we realized we just wasted 2 hours of our time on sub-par food.  When all was done, we still had $25 left on our gift cards.  Found a homeless man on the corner and gave him the gift card because we will never go back."}
{"text":"Just ate here and really missed this place. I've eaten at other Bucas around the country and was needing my Italian fix!

We started with the mozzarella sticks / triangles. They were hand made and probably the best fried mozzarella I've ever eaten. However, it's $13.99 for 8 of them. That's double the price of most mozzarella appetizers and we could have eaten 2-3 orders of these. But it was delicious.

So we ordered another appetizer - the mini meatballs. I was under the impression that they were stuffed with cheese but they weren't. They were pretty decent but we thought they tasted a little odd. We weren't crazy about them.  The portion was small and again, this tiny appetizer was also $13.99, which I find expensive for an appetizer.

The house bread with oil and Parmesan was good and we ate a lot of bread. The servers were friendly but were never in a hurry. It wasn't busy at all but we had to wait 15 minutes to get our check once we were done eating. Most of the meal operated at that pace, which I find frustrating. I mean, if my drink is empty, please fill it up now, rather than 15 minutes later!

Ok, so onto the main entree: we ordered chicken parmigiana. We ate the smaller order which had 3 big pieces of chicken and was about $20. It was good, although my wife and I weren't crazy about it because it had little onions all over as well as little tomato chunks all over (as opposed to a nice tomato-like sauce that other places typically serve).  All in all, food was pretty good, arguably much more authentic than other Italian places, and it was a good experience. I think this place can be amazing if you find the dishes you really prefer to eat. 

One other thing: I wanted the usual salad that I had ordered in the past from Bucas and was told by the server that they didn't carry it, although \"all the other Bucas carry it.\" I found that to be a little odd. 

Anyway, we will return but I'd like to see some improvements."}
{"text":"Had a great waitress named Andie that did me and my wife right. Fair warning, the food comes out in family sizes so save the money (and leftovers) by agreeing on one entree with your SO and sharing.

Tasty"}
{"text":"I see a lot of low rathings and I am shocked.

The food is family style, so if you are not prepared to eat, don't go.

The chicken marsala is different, I had tried it here since I never had before, and it is almost like sweet & sour chicken without the sour. The baked ziti, was fantastic tasting!

We did not order a dessert, however, the sunday is bigger than the face of two people and has twelve pieces of brownie....the waiters have to hold it with two hands when they bring it out, so if you have a sugar attack, consider going for that - you will not be dissapointed.

The atmosphere is stimulating, pictures, paintings and portraits everywhere!!"}
{"text":"Had our parent's 50th wedding anniversary there just a few days ago. Utilized the Pope Room there for our large party. 
Staff was friendly, helpful and accommodated several special requests that helped make the night very special. 
The food and service were both amazing. The value for our $$ was extraordinary!!
I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with friends and co-workers. While the food we ordered was flavorful, the service was horrible and slooooow. We waited almost an hour for the food to be served. The waiter could not be located and we had to ask the receptionist for drink refills. The manager (if that was the manager) just chatted with the receptionist staff and did not go around to check with customers. We were ready to leave when the food came. There are better options out there I bet. Avoid this place if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little place! Went for Thanksgiving dinner with my significant other and ordered their special. Everything tasted amazing, service was fast and friendly, definitely a must return!"}
{"text":"They offer ridiculous portions. They food is good but everything came a bit out of traditional order, and I think that is because we had 3 different servers coming by our table. The draft beer was flat...stick to the bottles here."}
{"text":"buca used to be my go to place for decent italian food especially when they had all their discounts/coupons/offers...they still have those promo's..but not for take-out!!!!yikes...i work 2 jobs/husband professional...has yto work longer hrs/ and buca had the nerve to take down...my \"unlike on their facebook page!\"when you go to that page..there are no dislikes/no bad reviews??!!!they are putting what/whomever they want but not any dislikes..that is fraudulent..at the very lest violation of freedom of speech.(and no,i did not curse or use bad language!)"}
{"text":"Came in at 7:30p. Ordered a bottle of wine. Then he took our order, which was a small order of lasagna. But also ordered mozzarella and tomato basil crap, which was $15.00 for 5 slices of each. With no balsamic vinegar to put on it. Waiter comes back and said they are out of lasagna. Really!! It's a Italian restaurant, for God, help them. So our bill was $58.68 for just a bottle of wine and appetizer. We left no tip,for what? We didn't get silverware to eat our appetizers. Or napkins.  Never again even with a Groupon. I tore that shit up. Cause not going back. I left the half bottle of wine behind cause I was so pissed.  Bar service not even better. Waiting for a table."}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit to Buca di Beppo, and it honestly was not that bad. When we arrived, there was nobody at 1st to greet us, but stood around looking at all the Italian themed pictures and memorabilia. 

After a couple minutes, we were greeted and had to go up 2 small flight of steps to get to our table. 

Shortly after we were greeted by our sever, who took our drink orders. They have Pepsi products. I was hoping for some sweetened tea, which they did not have, though had a type of syrup that could be added to the tea to make it sweet. I chose the pear syrup for tea, which wasn't that bad at all. Server also said this was a family style menu or something to that effect. Looking at the menu it shows S and L above the selections, meaning small and large. The small served 2 and more, while the large served 4 and more. 

Not having been here before, we both ordered a small item each. She ordered the Penne al Forno (baked pasta) and I ordered Chicken Satimbocca from the entree section. She took our order and came back with bread, and some type of oil and something else. She poured the oil into a saucer, followed by pouring some type of vinaigrette dressing on top. She didn't explain what it was, but said they had butter as well, which my lady asked for. Still not knowing what the oil/dressing was I dipped my bread into it and was pleasantly surprised. The butter that came was in small packages, and it was not soft. 

Since the dish I ordered took some time to make, I got up from my table to look around the place. It was cozy, and had A LOT of things to look at. The music was themed as well to the restaurant. 

Well, we were a bit stunned when our food came. We should have just ordered 1 thing and split it... like the menu said, haha. We had so much food, we ate it for dinner, and I am even taking the rest for lunch. The food was decent, I didn't care for the chicken dish (not a fan of their artichokes). But the pasta dish was good. 

All in all was not too bad of a place. I will revisit at a later date."}
{"text":"Westlake Ohio location.  Been coming here for carryout for years and you have the absolute worst service I have ever seen. I have never written a review of a restaurant in my life, but you are all oblivious. Simply tell everyone it is a 2 hour wait, period.  I don't know how I have never witnessed a physical altercation when you arrive in 30 minutes like any normal restaurant that does carryout and end up waiting for an hour. I could go back and get the food myself.  I will say it is amusing to listen to the staff say it's never been this bad and here we have you some extra bread.  Get it together.

Hang on, it gets better.  I ordered chicken Limone, spicy chicken pasta and apple Gorgonzola salad, hey just came out and let me know they are ur of apples and can I pick another salad!? I am being punkd, right! Where is Ashton?"}
{"text":"Stay home and eat a frozen Swanson meal, it will be much better than any of the slop this joint serves."}
{"text":"The service is shitty...food sucks...we found a piece of glass sitting in our peach cocktail and one of us could have swallowd it and choked on it...manager asked us to file a security report and thats all they did!!!Please stay away...reporting this and be careful whats in your drink everyone!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very friendly and from out of town. Unfortunately I was not paying much attention to her dialogue so did not catch her name. I was thinking more about work. 

Dinner was soup and salad for opening and then chicken fettucine. 

The salad was ample size and deliciously tasty. The soup on the otherhand was fantastic in flavor. The rizo and spicy Italian sausage was exactly what the soul needed on this cold fall evening. 

The waitress waited until I was completely finished with my soup and salad before bringing out the entree. Nice. The chicken fettucine was hugh and was good but nothing outstanding.

The one thing I did not get was the bread. What happened? I decided to give the place one more visit before I left Pittsburgh but unfortunately I never had the chance...maybe the next trip."}
{"text":"Disaster on a recent Friday night. We were the only two customers in the bar area.
Bread - served ice cold twice
Mozzarella appetizer - tiny for $14.99
Quattro Formaggio - chef said it was chicken in the stuffed shells, but it was nasty sausage. We don't like or eat that stuff.There was no chicken in the spinach pasta either as the menu stated.
Beer - was flat
Pizza - undercooked.

The waiter was in his second day and it wasn't his fault and the manager said and did all the right things and only made us pay for the alcohol. Not going to return as this was really a bad night for BOOOOOca."}
{"text":"Very forced service. Dishes come preseason'd with whatever was left over from the group before smokey service  service will out a smile will be sure to bring the flavor out in your food."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat out last night (which we don't do very often) I didn't write the review last night because I wanted to sleep on it and decide if I really wanted to write it.....

This experience was the worst I have ever had in a restaurant, ever. 
We had originally wanted to go to Abuelo's next door, but they had a 45 minute wait. we walked over here to see if they had a wait, it was only 20 minutes so we stayed, unfortunately. We ended up only waiting 10 minutes, this was the highlight of the evening. We were seated upstairs in the back corner, which was nice and secluded, another plus. The hostess did not try to engage in any type of conversation, she showed us the table and started walking away, I had to stop her to ask for a high hair. 
I'm fairly sure our table had not been previously cleaned because we didn't have placemats or silverware like every other table did. Our waitress came by, asked if we wanted drinks and explained how their portions worked. We ordered our drinks, they arrived and then she disappeared for a good 10-15 minutes before coming to get the order. We ordered Mac & cheese for our son, a pasta dish (can't remember the name) and mozz garlic bread. 

About 10 minutes after we ordered our waitress dropped bread off at the table (which was stale and gross). There was another table that was seated near us a few minutes after we placed our order that also ordered garlic bread and they got theirs the same time we got ours....20 minutes after we ordered it? My sons Mac & cheese came before our bread, that's how long it took. Our waitress kept poking her head around to look at us but never actually said anything. This happened 6-7 times before she finally came over and said \"sorry your entree is taking so long. I rang it in but when I went to the kitchen to check on it and I couldn't find the ticket for it, so they are making it on the fly right now.\" So we waited some more, 50 minutes total from he time we ordered until our entree hit the table. I've waited awhile for food before, it usually doesn't bother me but what really set me off was by the time it finally came it was lukewarm at best! I worked at Yard House so I understand how a busy kitchen works and a check that has been refired should come out extremely hot, not like its been in the window sitting....which is what ours tasted like.

At this point I am furious and just want the check to come, I had like 2 bites of food before giving up on the whole experience. The manager came over and introduced herself and said \"I'm sorry your dinner took so long, we took it off the check\" and walked away. Didn't give us a chance to explain what happened from our point of view, but whatever we just said thank you. The waitress brought us boxes and could tell there was tension so she said \"sorry about that, at least it makes for a cheap date night.\" I get she was trying to ease tension but it wasn't an appropriate thing to say. I'm pretty sure our waitress just completely forgot to put our order in so she grabbed a dish that had been sitting for a while, because if she truly ordered a new one on the fly it would have came out piping hot. 

We will never ever return here again. Such a disappointing date night."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fun birthday dinner with our daughter and friends.  The food was good and service was decent but we were disappointed the gluten free menu (of which there was only 1 in the entire restaurant?!) didn't include a gluten free pasta option??"}
{"text":"If you're ok with food that tastes like it came from the frozen food aisle, then this is the place to go. Ordered the chicken parmigiana and it tasted like boxed breaded chicken you could get out of a grocery store with some extra on top to make it look nicer. High price tag for subpar quality."}
{"text":"The food is above average but the portions are ridiculously large, unless you have a big appetite. I like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would give them a 5, if I didn't feel some of their dishes were cheaply made but all in all they are pretty delicious! I'm a fan of the baked ziti but my boyfriend just raves about the Eggplant parm. He said it's the best he has ever had in his life (his 29 years of life)."}
{"text":"In celebrating our anniversary we choose to go to Buca do beppo with our friends.   It's been a long time since eating here, and after last nights experience it will be a lot longer before we go back.   The bar was out of Jack Daniels - something I will never understand how a bar can not have that staple - in fact when I said that I couldn't believe the bar didn't have Jack Daniels - the bartender said \"well that's rude\" to me.  The waitress was ok but I had to ask several times for my ice tea to be refilled, as well as ask for the desert menu.   The food was average and the consensus at the table was that the restaurant was now acting like a Denny's -  no offense to Denny's but we expected more from Buca di Beppo.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Food and service were both great! We stopped by around 4pm for an early dinner and it was pretty quiet. 

I always order the chicken carbonara (small) and a Shirley temple. This time we also tried out a bowl of the minestrone soup. 

Portions are huge and a small pasta was more then enough for my sister and I. We even had some leftover pasta to go. The soup was very tasty and it's quite filling as well. 

Our server was fast and checked up on us a lot of times. On the weekends it does tend to get pretty busy here so expect some waits.  

The chicken carbonara (small) runs for about $24 and the bowl of soup (enough for 2) runs for about $8.

{"text":"This is my first time going to this restaurant  since it was Valentine's Day my husband had set up the reservation a month in advance and requested to have a heart shaped lasagna when we arrived all the order we received was incorrect. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Celebrated Mother's Day and the food was good but as you know for the money you have to pay for large portion and know you will take some home. Very disappointed that when we got home we realized we left our food on the table. They through it out $45 worth, but would not offer to replace it. It's spaghetti Really. Makes me sad."}
{"text":"I was with a prom group of 48 who came here for the \"prom package\". This was a three course meal that we prepaid for and everything. The food wasn't revolting or anything. But the day after, about 25 of us got sick. Vomiting, stomach aches, migraines, fatigue you name it. We called the restaurant and they merely said \"we'll look into it\" and never called us back as they promised. The school nurses got involved, which brought the health district involved. They realized we have contracted norovirus. How can they take this so lightly?! I'm surprised they haven't called back many of the students who called them to report the food poisoning, begging them to take a free gift card or something. For crying out loud they took our names and numbers and said specifically they will call back the next day.

{"text":"Came here on our way out to Vegas from Phx. Our waiter Spencer was very friendly & knowledgable. Made sure things came out fast because we told him we had a 9:15pm flight to catch. Food was very tasty, only thing I would critique would be that the meatballs were just a tad on the spicey side but other than thateverything was awesome!! Kudos to Spencer!"}
{"text":"Best eggplant parm. and really good pasta dishes. Since all the meals are family style there are portioned for 4 or 5 people. So if you go with two people its pricy. But if you go with 3-4 its really reasonable and really good."}
{"text":"totally terrible service. i've been to other buca locations in the bay area and i think i'll stick to that.

i recommend getting the chicken marsala though. it's really good"}
{"text":"The food here is okay (2.5 stars)and does not completely satisify your appetite. Every time we have eaten here, we were hungry shortly after. Go figure. Well, the service here on the times we have visited has never knocked our socks off. Just okay. Very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy. It is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food. The garlic knots and calamari are consistently tasty. Not a place we want to run to on a regular, but good enough for a \"snack\"."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Okay service.

The best thing here was the cheesy garlic bread they served us from the beginning. The main dishes were not good at all, looked and tasted like throw up. And why was it so fucking dim, could hardly see my date's face. They had someone taking pics and selling to us... which was alright. My date was ecstatic because I don't usually allow others to take pics, camera shy and they usually take too fucking long.

Pffft. Olive Garden is better. Sad to say."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly! We got sat in our own private room, which was open to the kitchen. It was a little weird at first to be able to see and hear the chefs and kitchen staff, but it ended up making for a fun environment. The food is tasty and the portions are huge. We ended up over ordering by quite a bit! They are conservative when they say how many people each dish serves."}
{"text":"Just got finished dinner with the swimming and diving team. Overall a great experience- the service was out of this world and they all were very friendly. Our team is here for Training trip and we are originally from Rochester, NY. The meal was really good and I can't wait to go back to another Buca in New Jersey. Overall great meal!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food usual. Sign up to be a member and you get great coupons!!  It's family style so the portions are big."}
{"text":"Stuffed chicken was very good. We had the fettuccini Alfredo & garlic mashed potatoes for our sides. The fettuccini was really, really, really thick, but had flavor and the noodles cooked right. The mashed potatoes were awful, $12 for a side that had absolutely no flavor. Bland doesn't begin to describe the lack of the taste of the potatoes. 

Also, the noise level was way up there. We could barely hear the waitress and it took nearly yelling to be heard. 

Again, the main entree was good but past that no way. We will not be back."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite place! This is a family style restaurant, so get ready to debate on what dishes will be ordered. The serving sizes are true to the descriptions.  I've been going for years, including during my pre-gluten free days. We LOVE the garlic bread and margherita pizza,. Unfortunately, the percentage of gluten free dishes on the menu is decreased, however, they do have a gluten free menu. I recommend the chicken saltimbocca. One tip- we never order sides (usually just pizza, entres, and salads) because there is so much to fill up on in terms of dishes. The atmosphere is always fun and they are great with large groups of people. My sister had her wedding rehearsal dinner there and everyone was happy."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my family. Server was friendly but the place was overly priced. We ordered a large Caesar salad which was nothing special and it consisted of about one and a half head of lettuce(romaine) ,a few croutons, pamesan cheese and caesar dressing. That's it. 22.99 plus tax. WOW!   Large pasta dish and bread, no drinks and it came out to 65 bucks +tax.  Way over priced. Sorry but will not be returning."}
{"text":"We came for lunch and though we were the only table for a good chunk of our visit, service was quite slow.. I think the server, Evan, was just super lax; he took his sweet time before greeting us and getting drinks. But he was nice and checked up on us often during the meal and boxed everything up at the end.

We had to ask for the lunch menu cause serving sizes even for a small size off the regular menu would be way too much for two people to eat. Those entrees didn't even come with a side and that would be separate. But anyways, it didn't make sense why they wouldn't provide that at the beginning either.

I dined at the location at Ballys a month prior to this visit for a catering event and that was what made me want to return here. I had the chicken limone and was craving it thus that was what I ordered, with a side of spaghetti marinara. BF got the spicy chicken rigatoni. 

When the food arrived my lunch combo seemed like it was switched; it was as if I ordered a spaghetti marinara with a side of chicken limone lmao. The chicken itself looked like half a chicken breast! Nonetheless, it was good but the one I had at Bally's was better. The rigatoni had peas which I don't like but bf said it was also okay, quite heavy though.

I'd say come with a lot of people. I don't think a party of three or less will enjoy this place much even for the lunch menu portion."}
{"text":"A large group of us reserved a table for a girls night out. Our service was so incredibly slow it was ridiculous. It took them 20 minutes to bring us drinks, and not all of us at once, maybe 3 or 4 at a time. The food was lukewarm and tasted like it came out of a can. There was also an admin fee added to our check. When we asked what it was we were told it was a fee for them going through the trouble of reserving us a table.  Way too expensive, poor service, and bad food."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Buca di Beppo and I have to say that I was impressed.  The food wasn't the best Italian food (and probably not the most authentic, either), but I enjoyed the aspect of sharing that the restaurant promotes.

Between eight people, we shared four small dishes and two salads, much less than the waitress-suggested four large dishes and two salads.  The entire party was quite full at the end of it, so I'm glad we got the small sizes.  One of our party had a birthday and they made an effort to make it fun for her.

The interior was a bit confusing and I got seriously lost on the way to the bathroom, but that's okay.  It's also a little intense on the eyes (read: gaudy)."}
{"text":"We decided that this year, we would go out for Thanksgiving dinner instead of the usual.  Made reservations for 9 @ 4:00.  Got there about 15 minutes early, so expected to wait.  We waited till about 4:20.  We were seated next to the rear door, so there was a cold breeze every time he door was opened(they were using the outdoor patio to increase seating capacity).
We finally ordered our meal.  After a fairly long wait, our food was delivered.  What a disappointment.  Turkey was dry as a bone.  One tiny dish of cranberry dressing, and a small serving of potatoes.  There was stuffing under the turkey that was terrible.  Who thought that anise would be a good seasoning for turkey stuffing?
The only thing that I would call \"good\" was the potatoes.
I have spent Thanksgiving on a destroyer off the coast of Beirut, and that dinner was far and away better than this mess was.
The cost for this \"culinary adventure\"?  $295 for 9 people.

Never again !

Buca is passable for their Italian food, and I mean just passable.  I grew up in an Italian house, in an Italian neighborhood, speaking Italian.  I've owned and run Italian restaurants. I'm still the partial owner of one of the largest private Italian restaurants and clubs in the world  (over 35,000 members). It's hard to impress me when it comes to Italian fare.  There are very few that I would call good Italian food, Buca is not one of them.
BUT, stay away from these people for Thanksgiving dinner.  I made the mistake, don't do the same."}
{"text":"Ok, so Buca felt bad that we had such a bad time and kindly invited us back for another try. They didn't know it was me until after the meal. I have to say it was excellent this time-we didn't make reservations but were sat immediately, our waitress came by frequently to see if we needed anything, the chef and the manager also stopped by to make sure everything was going well. Our food and beverages came out quickly and were edible this time. Every staff member that we spoke to were extremely friendly and attentive. I actually would have given them five stars this time except I think its a bit overpriced. We ended up getting two small salads, a small order of meat balls, small eggplant parm and a side of spaghetti and 2 non-alcoholic beverages. The total was about $76 bucks but we did have enough leftovers for like two days. I don't know if they were just extremely understaffed last time or what but it was a much more enjoyable experience the second time around."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Buca for years. I always brought my family and friends in Seattle. However, recently went to one of the locations in Vegas. The food was good and the service was great but the corporate music sucked big time. It was sad to no longer hear the Italian music of Dean, Frank and Perry and others with rare exception.  It almost feels that Planet Hollywood that now own Buca has a problem with Italians.  I am sure if the restaurant served soul food they would not be playing Country music.  Bring back the Italian music, it's the right thing to do."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant at four different locations and every time I go, I walk or should I say, crawl out with a full belly and a smile from ear to ear! - Everything you order here will be great and everything you drink will be as equally appealing! - We have yet to have enough room for dessert, but this last time our neighbor table ordered some form of dessert bowl and it had to have been around a foot in diameter! LOL - You cannot go wrong with Buca, but make sure you've got a full wallet because you definitely get what you pay for!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place is only one star ahead of Olive Garden (which I don't care for )  in terms of the quality of the food... but it is pricier than OG. (Because of the price-point, I would acutally rate this place 2.5 stars instead of 3.) 

It is your typical Italian-American corporate chain cuisine. If you are hungry and want to find something \"nicer\" than the Olive Garden but not on the level of gourmet authentic Italian dining, this is an ok choice... especially if you are a family with lots of hungry mouths to feed.  

If it were totally left up to me, I would not choose to go here. Ever.  However, we have a lot of good friends who really like this place (??!!), so on occasion, I will suck it up and take one for the team.  

One problem from my perspective is the \"family style\" dining.  Typically, I am much pickier than my dining companions and I feel like I have to settle for something that I would not order if it were just up to me.  (And the same is true in the reverse, my dining companions try to find something to order that I'll actually eat). 

But, they do have enough options that I can find a chicken or seafood option. There are also a couple of selections of baked pasta that do not include meat sauce. 

When I eat \"Italian\" food, I typically like to enjoy a glass of wine or two. As expected for a place like this, the wine selection is not very good and is  more overpriced than the typical restuarant wine mark-up.  

Even with a coupon and not ordering the most expensive things on the menu, I generally end up paying more than I feel this place is worth. I'd prefer to take my business to a smaller locally owned restuarant any day - and especially when it comes to Italian food. 

I have only been a few times, but on each visit the service was a-ok.  The wait can be a little long depending on what time you get here, but the staff tries to make up for it by being super-friendly."}
{"text":"Great family style Italian restaurant with a decent selection of pastas and pizzas.  Huge portions and great for sharing in big groups.  The meatballs are even the size of softballs.  Get a reservation if you plan on going during peak times.  Wasn't too impressed with their desserts though... maybe just a bad night. 

The place had a fun vibe and the waitstaff was really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Ive only been once, but it was a very good experience.  I thought the atmosphere was fun, although a little crowded.  The service was good and the food was great.  It may be a little expensive but it's worth it.  I look forward to going again!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the baked rigatoni and mozarella garlic bread we ordered.  It was more than we could eat, and they didnt have cheaper options for 2 people.  Its not like you would pack anything to go anyways, being in Vegas."}
{"text":"I went with friends for lunch. After being seated in a small room, I was turned off by the smell and my shoes where sticking to the dirty wood floor.  I left with one friend.  Three friends stayed.  When I went back later to rejoin them, one lady was given the wrong dish. She had to wait 15 minutes to get her food.  All three where charged $5.00 for a side salad that cost $1.99. Another 10 minute wait for refund.  The restaurant was not busy.  Dirty and bad service."}
{"text":"The decor is a bit odd but the food is good.  Large portions.  Stick to the lunch menu unless you want to loosen your belt. The best part is that if you call in early you can get the chef's table for no extra cost."}
{"text":"This chain has slipped way off the charts recently. We had a horrible experience at another Buca location and then decided to go to this location to use the credit they gave us for that bad meal. This meal though was equally horrible. Two different bread baskets came out ice cold and nobody seems to know if the bread is supposed to be served warm or room temperature. This bread was neither, until the waiter finally put the bread in a bread warmer for us on our request. We then wanted to try some of the World Pasta month specialties and they apparently ran out of the noodle used in the chicken Campenelle dish. We subbed another noodle, but they made us the totally wrong dish. Finally, they bring out the right dish, but it was not good at all. The pieces of chicken were hard as a rock and the dish looked nothing like the photo on the menu, just alot of uncooked onions and tomato sauce. The sparkling sangria also needed help as the $13 drink was mostly ice and contained only lemons and limes which you can't eat and sangria needs to have edible fruit soaking. Just a total mess, stay away."}
{"text":"I always love the wait staff at Buca, they are the best! That being said, everything else is meh. The food is over priced and not that great. If you make a reservation, expect to wait at least 30 minutes, if you don't make a reservation, expect to wait at least 30 minutes... see what I did there? The hostesses are pretty terrible... I don't honestly know why we go back..."}
{"text":"When in Vegas watch out for David Gordon manager at Bucca di Beppo in Excaliber. Not professional, disrespectful. Found what appeared to be roach leg in my pasta he claimed it was a sun dried tomato.....yikes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Buca di Beppo for a long time and it used to be good. To start - the hostess was extremely rude. She was going to place us at a table by screaming kids, so I asked to sit somewhere else. She got annoyed with us, grabbed the menus off the table, and then put us at a different table, tossed the menus down, rolled her eyes and walked away.....wow! Second - The food was very bland, the pasta dish we got tasted like spaghettios...yuk. Third - I had to use the bathroom, and what a shocker......There was urine all over and around the urinal, toilets had urine running down sides of the toilet, the hand towel dispenser had tons of dust on it, poop was smeared around the kids changing table, mildew was around the sinks and mirrors, floor was extremely sticky, bathroom smelled like urine, and to top it off there were bloody boogers smeared on the wall. I told the waitress that the bathroom needed to be cleaned that is was discusting. She must of mentioned it to the manager because he came to the table and asked me rudely what my problem was that the bathroom was up to his standards. WOW! I was so mad that the manager thought the bathroom was clean that I went back into the bathroom and took pictures and showed them to the waitress. She was even grossed out. Manager needs to be fired! Needless to say we will never be returning to this place EVER!"}
{"text":"I had a $20 off  $40 purchase.   We ordered the small veal Marsala, side of pasta and the small apple salad.  I drank water and my husband had soda. While the food was very good, it was costly. The bill was $60 but thankfully with the coupon it was $40. I left $12 tip but if I didn't have the coupon, it would have cost us $70 including tip. In retrospect, we should have ordered a large veal because it was only a few dollars more.  We did not have any leftovers. 

The manager was very friendly. Our waiter was very nice and attentive but the kitchen could not keep up with orders. It took a very long time for our entree to arrive."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant and I may not be back. It took the waiter about 4-5 minutes just to greet our table. We ordered an appetizer and he didn't come back right away to take our actual order. We ordered the quattro al forno which was supposed to have 4 different types of pasta and one of them was missing. The waiter didn't once ask how our meal was or if we needed anything. I will also add that it wasn't all that busy in here as it Easter Sunday. Our friends ordered baked rigatoni and the pasta was undercooked. I wouldn't recommend this place. I was a waitress and I think I give people a fair chance when I go out to eat. Oh and we got a different waiter at the end and our first one never came back to the table. Gotta love shift change!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place, it is inside Excalibur in Las Vegas, old school Italian family style food. We ordered penne pasta and they make to order."}
{"text":"We had Buca di Beppo host our daughter's wedding reception in their separate dining hall.  We had a fantastic experience.  There was no charge for the dining area and they charged a very reasonable price for each entrée.  The staff was super attentive, with no delays between courses.  Quite a feat considering we had 74 guest attending.  With no reception hall fee, no catering/delivery fees, no decorating fees, our total cost was less than $2,000.  The only extra we had was to have a wedding cake delivered.  Our daughter, her husband and all attending had a wonderful experience.  We recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Finally got great service , thank you Carlan! We got the large calamairi, spicy chicken rigatoni, shrimp Florentine and the colossal brownie. Everything was great! Our last visit we had horrible service we waited 15 mins. B4 getting our drink order taken and they weren't busy ! Two thumbs up day"}
{"text":"Wife and I came because it was a friday evening and every other resteraunt was slammed. Service was excellent, food tastes ok. I had been here a few times years before. I knew it was built around large portions and advertised as family style.


Small calamari app, stuffed mushroom app, Margherita pizza and an ice tea = $63.00 

The portions were not large. My 110 Lb wife and I cleaned our plates. The only reason we did not get dessert is because the prices were ridiculous. 

I think it was 11 or 12 for Tiramisu. In a chain novelty resteraunt?"}
{"text":"We came here for mine and my niece's birthday on a Saturday in December. We had made a reservation for 20 people and had pre ordered everything. We were sat at three separate tables. Our service was terribly slow, and they double charged my husband on his card when they were supposed to have only charged a minimal amount because he paid in cash. They couldn't get their ish together at all. Pretty rough experience. I will never ever ever go here again, nor will I recommend anyone else go there either."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Took my whole family out to dinner tonight to celebrate my mom's birthday and the food was not good. The chicken Marsala was way too sweet and the chicken wasn't even hot. We ordered several dishes and they were all cold expect for the eggplant parmigiana. I will not come back and I'm ashamed that I spent so much money there."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday 2/8/2015.  First sign something was off was when we walked through the kitchen and the \"chef\" was reading the picture cards on how to prepare the food.  Only 4 tables seated, we ordered a pasta dish and a pizza.  Well 70 minutes later we were done waiting.  Asked for the manager and he couldn't have been more rude or condescending.  Never going back and certainly explains why this restaurant was dead and everything else on Scottsdale Road was packed.  Looking forward to a new concept coming soon to this location."}
{"text":"Beware, terrible service.  It took 20 min for the order to be taken.  It took us more than hour to get food. We were ignored the entire time that we were there and forever to get drinks refilled.  The waitress instead was chatting with her friends and ignored us by not checking on us.  She arranged tables next to us instead of serving us.  She offered to get us bread and then forgot.  We had to ask for check and even that took a while.  Not coming back .  

The food was okay.  Portions for meal were good but the side dish portions were small and not worth it. 

It took more than 2 hours of waiting for a spaghetti dinner ....  avoid this location if you do not feel like waiting and being ignored."}
{"text":"Good Italian food but the servings are huge. We ordered from the lunch menu thinking the portions were smaller but no they are still enough for sharing. The best part was the lemon cake for dessert a little expensive $13.99 but it was enough to eat half in the restaurant and half to take back to our room so I guess the price wasn't too bad since I got to each twice"}
{"text":"Beware of placing delivery orders through apps like Door Dash, Uber Eats etc with this particular branch. This location has accepted orders and then cancelled them last minute on me. On one occasion, they didn't even inform us they canceled the order. I had to call the delivery service to inquire where my order was an hour later, and they called Buca. They were told \"their internet was down\" and never received the order.  Yet, I received an e-mail confirming the order which requires the restaurant to accept the order for it to be confirmed. This suggests they accept a lot of orders and when they can't fulfill them, they conveniently cancel them at the last minute. 

I love their food but this location is not particularly managed well and these types of tactics are not appreciated. I absolutely would not trust ordering food from them using any App or delivery service."}
{"text":"Service was good, and the restaurant has a nice vibe to it.  The food was mediocre at best.  Biggest problem was the amount of dust in the place.  It was nasty. i actually dusted our area with a napkin before we ate.  Asked to see the manager who I felt dismissed us with excuses, that basically he has only been there 3 weeks and is trying to raise the standards.  Did you not see the dust the day you walked in?  It was obviously there for a long time.

Went to their corporate site to complain and there is no place to reach out to them. On the Contact Us page it is just a bunch of FAQ.  I find it odd that there is either no way to give feedback, or it is so buried you can't find it.

FYI Buca if you are reading this no need to contact me.  I am sure not returning and there is nothing you can do to change my mind about that.  You need to do a lot better."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! We came here to eat on Christmas Eve and they were not busy yet. We ordered the Chicken Marsala , Penne pasta and chesse bread and brought food home and gave us two and a half meals !!
The staff was ok. Our waitress was slow in bringing us refills on our drinks and our check when we wanted to go. But the delicious food made up for that. 
This location is inside Excaliber upstairs. You can make reservations online too.
We will be back. I believe they open at 10:30 and close late 7 days a week and all Holidays."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much - and Buca Di Beppo was exactly what I expected.  Ridiculous, obesity-causing portions (we got the small, which appeared to still be enough to feed a family of four), moderately tasty food, and an atmosphere that screams \"CHAIN!\".  If it weren't for the $25 gift card, I wouldn't have bothered going... but I'm not one to turn down a free meal!  So, for a free dinner, it was A-OK.  I certainly wouldn't bother going back if I was actually paying though... there are way too many local gems serving up genuinely delicious pasta to devote my money to."}
{"text":"OMG - I just had one of the best Italian meals in a very long time.  Started the meal off with the Buca Trio platter & a  Disaronno sour.  We shared a meatball & for the main course, we had chicken Parmesan & Cheese Manicotti.  Desert was none other than the Tiramisu.  We sat in the kitchen & got to know all the staff:  thanks to Andrew, Mo, Jeremy, Ray x2 & Norrese for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great Italian food! This place is great for parties and big groups. The prices are honestly just outrageous, so I would save it for a special occasion. It's around $15-$35 for each dish, but it is family style."}
{"text":"Walking the strip after attending a Vegas wedding we stumbled upon this place . Glad we did ! Shared the large spaghetti and meatballs and ordered extra meatballs .. good service , reasonable price . No wait in line to get in and eat !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for dinner around 10:30 on a Tuesday.. Not many people in the restaurant. We got our drinks quickly and food followed in a decent time frame. We just ordered a few appetizers: fried mozzarella, mini meatballs, and garlic bread. We both love fried mozzarella, it's our favorite fatty food.. And they unfortunately have no ranch here! That's what makes them so good so they were bland.. Had to use Caesar :( Other than that the restaurant was just meteorite. Waiter, Ian, was friendly and quick to bring things out and help us."}
{"text":"First ever visit was Monday 02/12/18 @ 7pm. I like the decor. Server was Michael. Friendly and funny. Portions are pretty big. Don't get large unless you have a least 4 people. Had Veal Parmesan and it was excellent. Also had pasta and sauce. I really liked the texture and flavor of the tomato sauce. You can also order different types of bread, but the bread that comes with the meal is great. Crunchy outside with soft middle. Wanted dessert but was stuffed AND had food left to take home. We are definitely going back to this restaurant!"}

{"text":"I dont understand the bad reviews! Today was my first visit there.  I went with my parents during off-hour lunch times, so maybe that was a big difference between other reviewers and myself.  It was very dead, which was great.  My parent's go there all the time usually during lunch.  They request a certain section on the lower level by a bar toward the back right ( from the lobby).  They always get a waitress named Helena, who was an absolute gem!  She and my dad talked about the MLB ( baseball) for a good 5 minutes, and as a big baseball fan, I was impressed by how much she knew!  

I ordered the Chicken Parm.  I have no idea what other reviewers are talking about.  I got an awesomely seared chicken parm dish that came with spaghetti.. All for like 9$!

My parents loved their food too! 

I loved all the Italian \"schwagg\" on the walls, it was fun to look at for a bit.

Temperature inside was perfect.

I guess some people just like to complain.  

And please, take your kids to McDonalds... not places like this.  Seems to be an Arizona thing....

PS-  If you come during a Friday/Sat night Primetime dinner hours, I am sure, like EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD..... you can expect things to be a bit more bustling."}
{"text":"Awesome service on New Year's Eve from Angelo!  He was prompt amd very courteous.   Food was excellent as well!  Portions were huge, so had to be careful not to over-order."}
{"text":"Service and food was good, would had liked bigger portion size for the price. The small size did not feed me and my girlfriend."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to go for a good, old-fashioned Italian meal.  The decor is riduculously kitchy and stereotypically \"Italian\", but a lot of fun.  If you go with kids, I highly recommend asking to sit at the \"kitchen table\", a booth that's actually located right inside the kitchen!  You get free entertainment as you watch the chefs and waiters scurry about.  (It's usually tough to get this table for dinner, but fairly easy during the lunch hours.)

The food is very good, and the \"small\" portions are easily enough to split between two people.  We ordered a \"sampler\" meal, which included ravioli, cannelloni, stuffed shells, and manicotti.  Delicious!  Our little guy ordered the spaghetti and meatballs off of the kids' menu, and barely finished half of his meal.  Prices are reasonable, given the portion sizes, and I have found several coupons for $10 off of a minimum $20 purchase, which is a great deal!

Tip: Come for your birthday and receive a free dessert (if you have room)!"}
{"text":"Bomb diggity customer service by server Lamad.
New to buca and killin it. Thank you much for the great service and the wonderful food. Everything came out in a timely manner and looked tasty, tasty yummy too!"}
{"text":"I've genuinely had great experiences at other Buca di Beppo locations, but not this one. Am I just unlucky?

Today's lunch experience was really the final straw. We arrived for lunch as a party of 2 to an empty hostess stand. There was nobody else waiting. We stood around for 10-15 minutes before a cook peeked out around the corner of the kitchen and let us know someone would be with us shortly. It was probably 5 minutes later when the hostess showed up and seated us, but it felt like forever.

Every single time I have been here, it has taken way, WAY too long for our food to arrive after ordering it. That includes today. I didn't look at how long it had been since we ordered when we finally got our food, but it was probably around 30 mins. For lunch, that's unacceptable, considering 1) how little people there were at the restaurant and 2) how the party of 2 seated after us received their more complex dishes within 10 mins of ordering.  My boyfriend's chicken was also very obviously reheated. The chicken had telltale signs: cold around the edges and extremely hot in the middle. Actually, his whole meal was probably forgotten and then stuck in the microwave. It was just sad looking. I generally like the baked ziti from Buca but mine wasn't really that great tasting compared to previous times I've had it. I don't expect a chain restaurant to have fresh-that-day-and-super-amazing ingredients but... this lunch was a disappointment.

I think our unhappiness scared off our waitress. She came by only twice after our food was served. First, she asked how our lunch was going, and almost immediately ran off before I could say more than \"okay\". Then she dropped off our check and a box after we had to ask some random plain-clothes wearing guy (the manager, probably) for it. Then the same guy picked up the check and brought back my card and said goodbye. We walked out of the place, right by our waitress, who didn't say anything. Sorry, lady. :(

I don't know. I still genuinely like Buca's tiramisu and, at least until this one I just had, their ziti. I think if I ever really desperately crave these dishes again I'll just get it to go instead of having to sit through such awful service."}
{"text":"Had dinner there the other night.   Restaurant was dead but food took forever. Spaghetti sauce was watery and spaghetti was not al dente.  Chicken parm was bland.  Bread was stale.  Waiter was very sweet and apologetic.   Been here before and it has been very good.  Guess they got complacent.  Left angry"}
{"text":"We really wanted Italian food but wanted it to go-didn't feel like sitting in a restaurant this night.  We called Bucca di Beppo and placed our order-very nice lady on the phone.  We let her know that we had a coupon for $10 for our order of $20 or more.  
When I got to Bucca to pick up the food the lady that helped me was plain rude! She took my credit card and I asked if she had discounted the coupon and before I could answer she swiped my card. I got my phone out to show her the coupon on my phone and she said \"we only take coupons you have to give us.\" As I was still talking to her she walked away from me-out of the room and showed up behind me with my food-again while I was still taking! Honesty I don't know that I have ever been treated so poorly! 
The food was good but I wouldn't recommend going there if that is how they are goign to treat their customers. There are plenty of other options out there with good food that will be happy to take my money!"}
{"text":"Bread was cold, tap room temperature water (tasted unfiltered and gross),  tomato mozzarella and basal had no olive oil and vinagrette !  The Vegas location had smaller proportions than regular restraunts.  This Vegas restaraunt does not offer certain menu items such as penne arriabata .  Where is the consistency and quality control. Buca company owners I am disappointed in how your different locations can vary as far as menu options .  Maybe you should have a talk with Cheesecake Factory on consistency of menu options"}
{"text":"The first and, so far, only time I've gone here was a pretty good experience. I was unaware that it was family style. So was my date... But it ended up making the date that much more interesting since we had to come to an agreement on what the heck to eat. Staff was very friendly, especially the host! Server could've been better but she certainly wasn't the worst. Great food and very generous portions!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Buca! We enjoyed the atmosphere and love the laid back environment. Our server was attentive and pleasant. We of course had plenty of food and had plenty to take home. We enjoy the spaghetti and meatballs, prosciutto stuffed chicken and the antipasta salad."}
{"text":"Gross. I will never ever go to Buca again. It is processed crap. We got chicken Alfredo and the chicken wasn't even freshly cooked breasts, it was canned chicken. Plus the Alfredo sauce was laughable. I am normally not this picky with chain restaurants but when I am paying 80 dollars for two people to eat dinner I expect it to be much better than it was. We had a ton of food left over and we just threw it in the trash."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  How can spaghetti and meatballs taste so good !!?? Tomato, Basil and mozzarella was fantastic. And of course the garlic bread....again with mozzarella on it was sooo good. Thank you to all the staff from the kitchen to our server. We had a great eat dinner and experience last night."}
{"text":"Prior to my experience this evening I would have given this location five stars. While my husband and I were having dinner there was a large group that was extremely drunk and loud. They started by singing but quickly crossed the line from amusing to obnoxious. They were yelling and screaming so loudly that my husband and I could not even have a conversation because we couldn't hear each other. What was most disappointing was the manager's response (or lack thereof). He came out, circled around them a bit, but said nothing. He could have simply asked them to quiet down but instead he stood off to the side complaining to some employees. Other guests were clearly uncomfortable and irritated yet the manager did nothing. Overall my experience was very disappointing."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE. We ordered and paid for a Christmas dinner delivery a month in advance and never received our food. The restaurant (and Janet) would not answer their phones or return voicemails. Extremely unprofessional behavior. We will never return to Buca di Beppo."}
{"text":"Buca, Buca, Buca, I get you ... I see what you're aiming for and I respect that.

But the next time you serve me what was clearly pre-made lasagna that is now back to room temperate cold because it is the first thing you reheated before making all the other food items ordered, we're going to have a big problem.  Dry pasta, barely any cheese (none of it melted), and bland meat that felt more like filler than an actual entree.

We got there and were seated promptly.  Service was good up until a party of 10 showed up down the hall and then we were the forgotten table all by ourselves in one of the sections.

The whole thing tasted and felt boxed and pre-made.  Nothing was genuine nor fresh.  Even the dessert ... I could taste freezer burn on the ice cream and the whipped topping ... the brownie was just chalky.  Bland!!!

...I usually spend more time on reviews, but I just don't have much to say.  The pricing does not meet up to the food quality.  The service is 50-50 based on how busy they are.  And overall...there's several better Italian offerings in this City.

...would I return?  Maybe, if enough folks in our group voted for it."}
{"text":"My family and I have come here many times in the past and had great service, but tonight ruined it for us all. We came in and the place was nearly empty. Sat down, ordered, got our appetizers 30 minutes after ordering, and the entries took AN HOUR after that to come out. I know people are dramatic but I'm being totally serious. Our food came out super cold and bland, it was gross. My father called the manager over and he had such attitude and was not professional at all. He offered to re make our food, but after waiting forever for crappy quality, we didn't want to wait any longer. He then said \"we'll tell me what you want me to do then.\" My after became very upset and the manager walked away without offering any way to fix the situation! Our server was very attentive and we assured him it was not his fault, we were very upset with how the manager spoke to us. The manager came back and was cutting off my father with every word being very rude, defensive, and unprofessional. After countless arguments our food was paid for, and we left a big tip for our waiter for being so patient. Management needs to learn a lesson in customer service. We will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The food here is nothing special the portions are huge!! We had Cesar salad it us way too much parm the bruschetta was great!! Our server Shane was FANTASTIC!! This is the second time that we had him as a server! He is very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations!! I watched him with his other tables and he gave the same great attentive and friendly service! The food again nothing to write home about but we will come back just for Shane!! The manager did come by and ask us how everything was and he did apologize about me not liking the food but that's ok! I appreciate more the fact that he came over and was concerned !"}
{"text":"I thought about wording this somewhat proper, but I will word the way a blue collar working man like myself speaks. 
We were less than greeted by someone who I can only assume was a manager, partly due to his attire. Anyway before saying hello the dude was a total dick and asked us if we were coming in looking for a table, l inke we would be there looking for anything else. Normally that would be an issue, but guy was glancing at his watch like we were coming in 5 mins until closing time, and we were far from closing time. Long story short my wife and I had just returned from a long trip and were looking for a nice solid meal, to end our trip. 1st impressions are important and the literal 1 minute I was in there spoke volumes of the service to come. F-off to the manger at the door for just being a rude duck."}
{"text":"First. Beautiful interiors. Good for date,good for family dining,and parties.
I went with my mom  Actually My mom is pasta-lover so We asked to the surver what should we order,and he helped alot (unfortunately,forgot the name) honestly,Taste was ...so-so. 
Sorry but taste was better in this place about 5years ago."}
{"text":"I hosted a party of 21 ladies on Saturday. I dealt with Trisha when I booked the Luncheon. She was professional and covered all charges up front with me.
Anthony was the Manager on duty and he was amazing! He interacted with the guests and checked with me 3 times during the Luncheon make sure everything was to our liking. Our servers were delightful and seemed to enjoy serving us.  Food was delicious!! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Service has been great lately, I wish they offered healthy organic pasta and sauces, the more I read about GMOs (genetically modified) foods the more I realize they are toxic for us.  Virtually all wheat, soybeans and food grown in America is GMO unless labeled organic or GMO free."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!, called ahead and asked for one of the neat rooms since my son-in-law had never been there and they seated us in the bar!! It was loud and crowded. Our waiter Aaron, had a major chip on his shoulder, he was rude and even asked us if we had already paid for the drinks we had ordered at the bar, while waiting for our lovely table. We told him we had but he looked at us as though we were lying (really??). From there it only got worse, we had to remind them several times to sing happy birthday to my son-in-law and when they finally did, they brought out a candelabra for him to blow out (pretty chintzy). Food was mediocre at best! Never asked to take us through the kitchen, which they are known for and my son in law never really got to see the decor of any of the rooms(except the bar). I could go on and on about the rude service but the thing that really got me was when they brought the salad and plates out, the plates were so hot that the lettuce wilted and went limp and soggy, the minute it touched the plate! Please, don't waste your hard earned money at an establishment that doesn't give a rats *** about pleasing the customers but rather how many people they can heard in and out in an evening.
Needless to say...I will NEVER go there again!!

Laura
Disappointed diner'"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better its totally correct! However, if you live close by and want something to feed the family that is ok and relatively cheap, this a good place. It''s very loud inside and the decor is very busy but nice. 

My reason for one start is because three times now we have ordered to go food and it seems that our dish was sabotaged each time! Twice came without chicken and all twice with the bread being super cold as taken out of a freezer recently. One time came swimming in sauce and it became disgusting to eat. 

I called the restaurant for one of the occasions. They didn't act if it was important or a big deal. They refunded me only after I requested and it took over a day. I was told someone would call me back to follow up and I received no calls. 

If you are in business to serve people their meals, you should take a little extra precautions that the food is done correctly. I should not have to get home with hungry kids and have items missing. This should never happen twice or even a third time. 

It seems to me that this Bucca di Beppo is careless with the food they serve and how they treat their customers."}
{"text":"Ooooookay.  Here is the deal about buca.  I do enjoy the food but I am very outraged by the prices.  The waiter here has a crush on bradford and I'm straight but brad is a sexy guy.  

Soe we got a couple of beers and an app and three meals for over a hundred clams after tax and tip.  So 1 star is deducted.  

If you go there get the chicken saltimbocca.  Sheer delight!"}
{"text":"We hosted a large family gathering at this Buca di Bepo and we were pleased with the high level of service provided despite it being a busy Friday night in Vegas. Dave was unfazed by the size and demands of our group, from delayed party guests to multiple requests for specific kid's meals. He quickly assessed the needs of the group and tailored his service without skipping a beat. He definitely deserves commendation for his hard work and dedication. Our event was a huge hit."}
{"text":"What I'm talking about is some good ole down home Italian cooking,and a real family feeling of Welcome! I flash back to the mid-70's and how close the Burroughs of NY made ya feel like a family. And everyone comes to Mama's for dinner kinda place.

Now I have been to a few BDB's throughout the country and everyone offers some really good eats but it's the feel of this particular BDB's that shines out the rest. There generous portions are so large you'll get stuffed in no time. Here they have a choice of sizes to the menu plates.
I suggest that you get a couple of the \"Family Size\" plates cause you'll want more later as a midnight snake.

The first time I went to this location was just before the holiday's and close to closing so I assumed (about 10-10:15). I brought my slave after a day of chaotic running around,
The place was almost empty with the exception 3 men all talking Italian in the booth two over from us. Italian standards were playing and our waiter \"Ken\".
He had a very distinctive Bronx slang and was the perfect touch that a restaurant like this demands.

Polite, patient and knowledgable, Ken knew exactly what we needed and wanted for dinner. He made us feel instantly like we were family treated us likewise. His suggestions were right on the money too.

The food and wines were very palatable with the exception of the house wine (so pay the extra $5 and get something better).

The second time was with a large group of about 10 and lemme tell you again the service, food, drinks, jokes and laughter so delicious the we didn't wanna leave after 3 hours with absolutely no pressure to go we were exhausted and ended with picture momentos of that night.  We even have hung the pictures on our wall at home.

So if your feeling hungry and want to feel the love of friends and family the go to Buca di Beppo and don't forget to ask for Ken for that true authentic feeling of Mama's home cooking."}
{"text":"Amelia was a beyond awesome server and food was great!

Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"At Buca, you always feel like family!  Always smiling servers and the kitchen staff is willing to say hi, no matter how busy.  Stephen (server) is always happy and always anticipates drinks/orders. This was the 3rd time as Stephen serving and always a delight."}
{"text":"Went there late one Saturday night, I was surprised to see it mostly empty.  Although I will say this place is on the expensive side... but you get a lot. 

Our server was great, in fact we were given a tour of the kitchen and got to say hello to the kitchen staff. 

The bulding inside is fantastic, there are so many pictures and things to see on all over the walls, and including the toilets.  Some of the old photos are very funny!!

I dont eat meat and cheese normally, but my server and I am sorry i forgot his name, actually suggested he create me a dish... which he did... and boy was it good. 

Great atmosphere, good food, made me feel like family for sure."}
{"text":"We've gone here for many special occasions over the years. The service is not bad and there's a variety of Italian food to appeal to most everyone. 
As cool as the family style can be, it really seems like it's never easy to decide with everyone or do the math on the appropriate amount of food. I've never left there without multiple extra boxes. Perhaps I just need to go more to adjust my models for Bucca di Beppo ordering? Haha. I suspect this is just built into their business model. 
Their food is good, but not amazing. I don't know why I always think it's going to be better than it is. My favorite is the margherita pizza, but you can certainly get better pizza lots of other places in town. In terms of any of the other dishes, same deal.
If you have a big party, Bucca di Beppo is perfectly pleasant place to go."}
{"text":"Way over priced and marginal quality food.  Red wine was served at room temp versus 58 - 62, full of scumbags doing vapor cigarettes and staff never stopped them, I paid 125 for food and wine worth 20 dollars and had to tolerate typical Vegas scumbags doing vapor cigarettes and being loudmouth losers!"}
{"text":"It's too bad. This establishment at one time was our family favorite. 

More than once we have had a disappointing experience. 

Today was no different. The server / bartender was attentive and our complaint is not against her. 

Our entree was delivered and the standard \"the dish is very hot\" warning was given. While on the surface the cheese and sauces appeared hot - one bite into the items tasted like luke warm pasta / meat / cheese. And \"luke warm\" is a stretch. More like room temperature. 

Totally ruined the expectation of a quality meal. 

Yes, the manager was contacted and we were comped. 

We were also offered the opportunity to return on another occasion for additional comped meals. But, honestly - we are just done. 

Would rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If I could rate the food and staff separately I would. 5 stars for the staff and 3 for the food. Food was alright, little bland.

Silly Billy was our server tonight, he was such a joy. Kept the mood very high dipite the issues we had with the food.

The first issue we had was with the salad, we asked for no olive in the salad, and the olive was not removed, and there was also the base part of the lettuce in the salad. That part you don't eat.

The second issue was with the Brussels sprouts. They were VERY hard and undercooked.

The staff did their best to help solve the issues with their food. The staff was amazing, attentive, and very friendly. Silly Billy is by far one of the best waiters ive ever had. I'd gladly go back to see him and eat more of the cheese cake.

The problems seem to be coming from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Wife and I dined here last night. Our waiter James was just the right amount off friendly and did a very good job. We started with the cheesy garlic bread which was excellent. The misses had the lasagna while I had the spaghetti and meatballs both were excellent.  Food is all made in house and very good lasagna is best I've ever had out."}
{"text":"Way over rated now.  When they first started it was novel and wonderful.  It is good for groups and special occasions.  It is pricey.  The pictures on the walls are are fun,  The food was much better before.  Very large family style portions.  They do have a chefs table that looked interesting."}
{"text":"First time here food was good. Atmosphere was good. But the staff was not customer oriented. Our server Dustin knew we were new there. His concern was on the fight that never came on tv due to wifi issues. There was customers going behind the counter. These customers had to be friends of the bartender. Overall too laid back didn't seem like a professional environment what so ever. You'd be fooled by the decor and feel of the restaurant. Went here for a quite dinner with my spouse"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend coming here for lunch. Apparently they have one server who can only handle one table at a time. Maybe placed an order for pickup?"}
{"text":"I was there for a bridal shower. We were walked through part of the kitchen to get to the reserved area. When we left, another guest told us we could walk through the restaurant but an employee redirected us through the kitchen. I felt this was tacky for a restaurant. To be treated as such is very disrespectful. The food brought to the table was cold and the Caesar salad was dry with barely any dressing. Another guest asked for more dressing but the staff never brought it. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Must translate to \"Palace of Pomodoro\"!  Not a big pasta fan but their sauce is perfection and Chick Parm is just right with thick cheese slipping off in a melted bronzed Magma of a heart warming grandeur.  
Plus the Balls di Meat were tasty as well.. firm but with a beefy tenderness.  Oh and the Bruschetta was Bro-shutta yo mouth amazing!!  Not to mention the portions were fair for take-out, I fully expected to get hoodwinked when we got home. But the shear weight of the bag hinted this could be a real belly buster!  With our coupon we got 4 meals worth of Italian Indulgence for $4/eater!!"}
{"text":"Horribly overpriced, more expensive than normal off the strip bucas. I called ahead and asked if they would accept a gift card with a coupon that was given through their email club they said yes. When I got there they said no they can't combine the two. The booths were completely dusty and smelled horribly. Looks like it hadn't been dusted in months! yuck! Will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Recently tried this place again via uber eats. Just overall not very excited about it. The prices are extremely high and even though it's ala Carter they don't meet the price points needed. They did not even provide any cheese with a spaghetti and meatballs order. The bread was fresh and meatballs were tasty but just way to expensive and overrated. Being from Chicago this is just sub par."}
{"text":"Do. Not. Go...unless you get Jarrett as your server. Party of ten took 2.5 hours from sitting to paying after having the manager get involved twice. Watched Jarrett work his tables and I know the experience would have resulted differently if Jarrett was our server. Jarrett is the man who eventually got us taken care of."}
{"text":"Two families went for dinner with some friends. We ate at the same table and had two seperate bills with gratuity  on each. When each family tried to use their coupons the manager said they could not do it because if was the companies policy. The food was alright and service was ok. Ask about the coupons before you eat and the beer was two expensive. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Went to Bucca di Beppo yesterday with a party of 5. All of us thought the place was neat...somewhat \"corporatized\" but still neat. The food was decent to good... service (sergio) was outstanding. We all left extremely full and satisfied. The bread should be warm ...(only drawback). Because of where it is and what it is price was moderatly high After all it is pasta and sauce...but we got 2 large dishes and my son got a kids pizza.. We had plenty left over. Go enjoy the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Omg had this for the first time today!!! And let me just say the food was amazing had the lasagna, salad and a chicken pasta was my favorite with cheese! Definitely will be back chief jose was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Food was excellent and service was great. Started with a calamari appetizer which was the best I have ever had, lightly fried and perfectly cooked! I had the spicy chicken rigatoni which was delicious and the girlfriend had the ravioli with a request of alfredo sauce which the server was more than happy to fulfill. She was very delighted with her ravioli which she also found delicious. To top it all off, our server was friendly, quick, and consistently made sure our drinks never went empty without us ever having to request another drink. Prices were a little high but well worth it considering the quality and huge portions. Sorry Olive Garden but you have been replaced. THANKS BUCA!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here since it opened, both eat in and take out. The last time was my birthday in December and have NEVER Had a bad meal. It's always tasteful,hot and as always plentiful. The wait people have always been nice an helpful. We once stood in line outside the mall in freezing rain for 5 hrs and looked like drowned rats and went there to eat after and they still treated us with respect."}
{"text":"Im not from around the area and it was my first time there yesterday and I loved it !
The customer service was excellent ! 
The food was delicious , the music was my favorite , such a perfect place for a romantic , Italian dinner .
I plan on coming back here again on my next visit to Arizona ."}
{"text":"Overall, a decent place and don't mind going back!
I would give it 3.5 if I could. 

I've only gone during lunch time,and both times I've arrived, there hasn't been a hostess to greet me. The first time I went, I had to walk around the restaurant to flag someone down. I usually sit in the bar area and have noticed that other customers have the same experience. 

The waiters are pretty friendly, which makes up for your initial impression. I've experienced both attentive and not so attentive waiters, but again, overall pleasant customer service. 

Food is pretty satisfying. You get a good serving size and if you're not too hungry, you can save half of an entree for later. 
I've had their tomato,basil soup (yum!) and their ziti (double yum!) I definitely crave their ziti every time I go. 

My boyfriend has had their Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and Chicken Parmesan.  I always try a bit of his food and both of us agree, it's pretty freaking delicious. 

Only disappointment is their garlic bread (who screws up garlic bread?!) It's really dry and I'm used to really buttery garlic bread. I've also tried the mozzarella garlic bread, which is better, but not the best I've had. 

Again, I've only been at lunch so I'm not sure how it is when it's busier. You'll have a good experience though."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant the food is awesome very big portions I went there with my whole family for Father's Day we had so much food left over that's how big the portions are and we had 12 people with us the restaurant is beautiful inside and out for the price of the food it is definitely worth it because how big the portions are I would recommend sitting at the chef's table if you don't have any kids that looks fun we sat at the Popes table if you have a bigger party I would recommend sitting there"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I didn't realize at first that it was \"family style\". The portions are very large, and the price is excellent when you consider how much food you're getting. It took over 10 mins for our waitress to come to our table after being seated. Other than that, we had an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"As a party of two, you'll have to agree on an entree because they are served family style with enough food for 3.  We agreed on the rigatoni which was outstanding. 

Service was excellent & staff was enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Visited July 2014. My two friends and I stopped by late at night for dinner. After all the hype it was a mediocre experience that ended up with all of us getting food poisoning - I'm fairly sure it was this place as we'd all eaten different things for 24 hours leading up to eating and sharing meals here.

I will say our waiter was fantastic, I wish I'd got his name, and we were seated very quickly. But the food was average. I've made better lasagna and I'm no Jamie Oliver! Then the next morning we all had upset stomachs...I couldn't believe it would be such a reputable place but like I say, we hadn't all eaten the same thing for a whole day before. It's a shame."}
{"text":"This Italian chain restaurant serves all their dishes family style; a small usually feeds 2 people and a large 4. There were 6 of us, so we ordered 3 entrees. Mom and I ordered a small chicken limone, dad and grandma got the baked ziti with meatballs, and my bro and boyfriend got the penne al forno. We also ordered a caesar salad to share.  

Our server brought us bread with oil and balsamic vinegar to start. The bread was yummy. Soft and warm on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I love to dip it in the balsamic/oil concoction. I ate way too much of this delicious bread. The salad came out shortly after and it was totally dry. We all agreed it needed more dressing so we asked for some on the side. The dressing was pretty bad. It's definitely from the bottle and we were all disappointed. Skip this and try a different salad. 

It wasn't long before the entrees came out. The chicken limone was my favorite. It's chicken breast with capers in a lemon butter sauce. It's tangy and delicious. I think we should have ordered a large size, as the small was just 3 pieces and everyone wanted to try some. Dad and grams had a huge bowl of ziti, with 3 huge meatballs that were as big as my head. Okay I'm exaggerating, but they were pretty big. Sadly, they weren't very flavorful. The pasta was okay. It had fresh ricotta, and mozzarella cheeses with marinara sauce. I didn't try the other dish, but the boys seemed to like it. It was similar to the ziti, but had prosciutto, pepperoni and spicy sausage. We realized how similar the pasta dishes were and wished we would have ordered something else. Oh well, next time. 

We had to have dessert, so we ordered the colossal sundae to share. It comes in a huge cup, with brownie pieces, 6 scoops of ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces, and whipped cream. I don't think there were really 6 scoops of ice cream, and the cup wasn't even filled all the way. We finished this easily. 

For all of the food we ordered it was just about $100 for 6 of us, not including tip. Our server was slow. He kept forgetting to bring us water and other stuff we asked for throughout our dinner. I would say this place is a step above Olive Garden, but not somewhere I would run back to or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"VERY VERY Noisy and beligerent people seated next to us who even threatened the 10 of us all over 75 years old.
Large portions of mediocre at best food
Looks like it caters to young families
Were afraid to leave and staff escorted us out with no apology.
Not even close to Maggianos for quality and service"}
{"text":"fun atmosphere and good food.  Really liked the bread and the meatballs"}
{"text":"Jarrett was our server. He was awesome and very attentive. Food was delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We discovered this location a few weeks ago and have already gone back for a second look. The two pasta dishes (baked penne and pasta rosa) were delicious and plentiful for ourselves and young daughter. The second trip we splurged on the apple gargnzola salad. It was also delicious although a bit short on the apples when compared to the menu picture. The service was outstanding both times. I like the walk through the kitchen when you first enter to go,to your seating.  My on,y issue was our table at the bar which became colder and colder to sit at as the meal progressed to the point both my husband and daughter had to wear coats.  We sat elsewhere the next time and it was comfortable. They also seem to be short staffed fromoverhearings of staff chatter. I'd recommend they keep that back room. Otherwise the experience was great. Very family friendly too."}
{"text":"This is the place to eat!!!!

There is a vast majority of high end items, and everything is made from scratch. Everything is made from scratch. I feel this Buca is getting a bad rep, but there is new management, and really everything is delicious. There are many reasons to choose this Buca di Beppo. One of the best things I have experienced is the celebratory dinning, another great aspect is the family style eating experience, and finally the atmosphere is true and authentic. 

We went here with a large party, and we all split a numerous amount of dishes. We had plenty of left overs, and all left satisfied. The entire staff was extremely grateful and helpful. We loved our service. Having family style options is great because everyone communicates about each dish and the party really stays lively. This establishment really nailed it when it comes to aesthetics. The restaurant really looks like an authentic Italian restaurant. Also, what a top end liquor selection. They had every wine imaginable and a full bar. We really like Buca and hope everyone makes a visit in. IT'S WORTH IT. Go in to Buca in Champaign for a great experience."}
{"text":"I went to this Bucca Di Beppo at the Excalibur in Las Vegas to celebrate my daughter's 1st birthday and we all had a blast! The food and service were good and they let us bring our own cake. I've been to other Bucca Di Beppo restaurants and this is one of the better ones I've been to."}
{"text":"Great place. Food was delicious and hot out the oven. These shrimp were crispy under all that tomato sauce and cheese it was smothered in. i gave it a 3 because they don't have a light menu for people that want less than the average two_three portion selections... Pretty pricey if you don't have a discount coupon here."}
{"text":"Well I have now tried Buca twice.  The first time was a few weeks ago at the summerlin buca. It was about 830 pm and my soup was not hot, the chicken breast prosciutto tasted store bought and frozen (and had a bone in it!!) and the lasagna was mediocre. Our server was great but the food service was very slow. I discussed this experience with Buca and they asked me to try again. To give them another chance because that is NOT their normal service or food preparation. So I did last night. We went as a small group before playing mini golf. Tried some different dishes and this time went to the paradise location. Our server seemed new. Or busy. It was 9 pm when we sat down and it took a long time to even get drinks (someone else brought our wine and beer) and bread. Then our applies came. The ceasar salad was ok. The stuffed mushrooms were tasty however getting like 7 mushrooms for like 14 dollars is ridiculous! A waste of money for sure. We continued to pour our own wine. We finally got our mains. The linguine with all the seafood was good apparently (the Guys shared that and I don't eat seafood). The chicken sausage ziti us ladies got. It was terrible! There was absolutely no flavor. No salt. No nothing. I ended up getting some marinara to try and \"give it some pizazz\" and still. Blah. So once again left there very unsatisfied. And thinking again \"what a waste of money\" because even after using the 20 dollar certificate the bill was still 100 dollars plus tip. Seriously like throwing money away. :-( so very sad when so many people tell me how good it is. Do I just have the worst luck?"}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of associates, are family style. The bread was great, service attentive, and most importantly the food was great. 

They seem a hair on the expensive side, but the dishes serve multiple - order on the lighter side

Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"We walked in on a Saturday night with a party of 15. Knowing they might not be able to accomodate us, we had other options in mine. We were told we could be seated in just a few minutes. Well, 20 minutes later the table is finally ready. Our server was nice, but overwhelmed. It took at least 10 minutes just to get drinks out to the table, and they were non alcoholic. There was a table of prom kids behind our table, and when they left, the table sat with dirty plates all over it for at least 15 minutes. Not very appetizing, plus I felt bad for the next group having to wait until the table got cleaned. The plus side is that the food was great! When we finally got it. Very slow out of the kitchen. The server couldn't even go around our table to refill water or coffee because the table behind us was so close- very annoying. So, I will rate this place a 3 star. Hire some bussers. Teach your staff to pre bus. Have more than one server on a party of 15. Food was very good, but it took a LONG TIME."}
{"text":"We have eaten or gotten take-out here several times. I like the fun decor and atmoshpere, except that it can be WAY too loud. That just means another group is having fun, but they get some pretty large groups and it is quite annoying to be seated a few feet away.

Regardless of the decor, don't come for the food, because it is not very good and is apparently *very* inconsistent. We have tried their baked dishes and didn't finish them because they were bland and just didn't taste good. Usually the spaghetti with meat sauce is practically all pasta. You can ask for extra sauce but they want to charge you for it (at least this is the case for take-out). The meat sauce has a funny taste. It isn't old, but the taste reminds me of something that is old.

Nonetheless, when we went out of town we decided to get pizza (usually good here) and pasta from Buca di Beppo to leave with the kids, and this is when it got bizarre. They must have made too much sauce that morning, or maybe it was a weird prank, because this time the \"spaghetti\" was probably three-quarters meat sauce! Weird; and not appetizing, and not a normal meal. And we didn't even ask for extra meat sauce. But the strangest thing is that when we got home from our trip, we found out the kids didn't eat any of the pizza. They would heat it up and throw it out because they didn't like it. I decided to have some just to get rid of it. It was pretty limp so I baked it in the toaster oven on the highest setting. Tried a bite and despite being re-baked, it was just plain mushy. It turns out there was meat sauce in the pizza -- lots of it! My wife did not order any meat sauce on the pizza. If all pizza tasted like this, I would never eat pizza again.

This tale might have ended okay if the restaurant did the right thing. Since the pizza was a total loss, my wife took it back to the restaurant the day after we got back. It is hard to believe but they would not give a refund, \"because it's been a week.\" This is not a good way to do business.

*UPDATE 05/28/2013*

I was pretty offended on behalf of my wife when I wrote this, she having been brushed off by the person on duty at the cash register. Regardless, the fact is that my wife is back to buying take out here, now and then. So the food isn't (normally) bad, although it is still a matter of taste."}
{"text":"We won't be going back again. This is our second visit and while the first was not amazing, this time was truly horrible. We ordered a salad to start. 3 bites into the salad and the entrees show up... so much for our salad. One bite of the chicken saltimbocca proved that it was made ahead or purchased and then frozen and reheated. The artichoke hearts were obviously canned and tough. It was awful and it was promptly returned. The spaghetti and meat sauce was passable but I did not try the meatballs my daughter ordered. The were so huge and dense, I can't imagine they tasted good, let alone the texture. We ordered the chocolate \"lava\" cake and it came so dry that all we ate was the middle and the ice cream on top.. microwaved for sure! When I confronted the manager and said that I thought he overused \"chef mike\" he knew EXACTLY what I meant and smiled, but did not deny it. Chef mike in the land of chefs is the mircowave... a HUGE no no in any professional kitchen that cares at all about the quality of their food... the biggest waste of $75 in recent memory... stay away!!!
Chef Jill Miranda, Ames to Please Private Cheffing."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking.  Food I'd perfectly salted.  Service is friendly and fast.  The decor is perfect."}
{"text":"We used Buca di Beppo for 2 big swim team dinners during a team travel trip to Chandler, AZ. They were awesome! We ordered food for about 45 people for 2 nights.

Lori is the sales manager, and she was extremely helpful. After we placed the order online back in September, she called and emailed to introduce herself and to make sure I had her contact incase we needed it closer to the trip. Then, she reviewed all of the dishes to make sure that they would be okay for the 3 swimmers on our team who have severe nut allergies.

The order was delivered on time, with the plates and serving-ware that we requested. Everything ran smoothly, the food was great, and the service was better than most of my catering experiences. 

I have used this business in Chandler in years past and the service was nowhere near as good as it was this year. I believe that Lori is new and she made all the difference in making sure that we had a great experience."}
{"text":"I came here last minute to use my Groupon. The waiter, john, was very patient and efficient. He brought out the fresh bread right away and refilled our drinks. The meal was a small penne portion and more than enough for two. It was very yummy. At the end of our meal, the server forgot to run the Groupon and my card was already charged for the amount. The manager, Jay, came to our table to handle the situation in a very professional and respectful way. We are beyond impressed with how they handled the situation. We will be back to this location because of the incredible customer service."}
{"text":"This is a delightful and popular restaurant serving a wide array of Italian favorites. I went for a group event and a large compartment within the restaurant was reserved for us. The servers were every attentive and friendly and the food was very good. And the portions were really huge! Most of us ended taking home part of our orders. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual and the low level of lighting make for a more relaxed mood during dinner. One of my main complaints about dining places in Scottsdale - especially in the Old Town section of Scottsdale Rd. - is that parking is difficult to find, but that does not apply to this restaurant. In addition to the parking areas surrounding the building, the restaurant has additional parking just across on the southern side of 1st Street, and of course there are additional parking spaces on 1st Street itself."}
{"text":"Excellent food calamari nice and tasty. Lasagna was exceptional really enjoyed it. Our server Lamond cant say enough about him he was great treated us like family"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the SO on a Saturday night. Wait was initially supposed to be ~40 minutes but only took about 25 to actually get a table. There seemed to be an excess of hostesses (5-6 up front talking to each other at any given time).

After being seated, it took about 10 minutes to get a drink order taken. Waitress attributed to having to help with a birthday on the other side of the restaurant. We immediately ordered the mozzarella garlic bread for an appetizer as well as the spaghetti and meatballs for our entree (dishes are \"family style\" so they're intended to share; would not recommend if you can't count on each entree having a couple of diners to tag-team on or plan on everybody having a lot of leftovers). Took awhile before we had our drinks refilled and our entree arrived about five minutes before our appetizer did. We initially told the waitress we didn't want the appetizer anymore since it hadn't arrived and we already had our entree. She immediately talked it over with the manager who then came over and decided to not only comp the appetizer but offered to comp a dessert of our choice as well. Also, the waitress was incredibly attentive after.

The mozzarella garlic bread: \"Decent.\" The bread itself was firm and crisp on the outside, fairly moist and chewy on the inside. Adequate amount of cheese atop all of the bread. There was also actual garlic cloves tucked under the cheese instead of the usual garlic-butter you'll find at most places. This was a bit unexpected and took some getting accustomed to, but it actually tasted pretty good once I adjusted my expectations. 

Spaghetti and meatballs (small): \"Decent.\" Pretty well-portioned to share between two diners. Noodles were typical, cooked properly. Sauce didn't taste overly sweet or ketchup-like, such as you'd find at Olive Garden, nor was it overly herby like some country-style sauce; it was a good intermediate. Entree could have used a bit more sauce. There were two large meatballs, one per diner. Outside was mildly crisp and inside was moist. Very creamy mouth feel. The flavor was a bit lacking. The meat definitely needed a bit more pepper and, perhaps, garlic thrown in and they would be excellent. 

Italian Creme Cake: Lemon cake was dense but tasty. Not overly lemony and not overly sweet. The mascarpone cheese filling was excellent. Ours didn't have much of the raspberry-hazelnut sauce, but what there was tasted decent. 

Conclusion: Initially, we were going to nix BdB as a place to return to based on the service, however, between the waitress and manager making sure we were well taken care of after the initial lengthy wait for a drink order and the kitchen mishap regarding the app, we felt they went above and beyond what was necessary to keep us happy. 

Food Overall: B; I've had better (Spaghetti Warehouse); I've had worse (Olive Garden, Old Spaghetti Factory, Carrabba's)"}
{"text":"Food Amazing! The alcohol beverages way to strong to enjoy! The waitress, painfully slow, no greeting, no nothing. Finally get the food.... then the check... 20 minutes still waiting for change... And we remember why we only go once every 2 years...."}
{"text":"I always come here with those $10 off coupons from the mail of $25-$30 meals.I love the food.I always order Frutti di Mar.My fav. dish. Service is good whenever I go..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately....totally unimpressed! It is very expensive for what you get.  The huge bowl of pasta were painfully spicy.
It was hard to find the shrimp that was hidden in it.  The mashed potatoes came out cold in a hot dish.
I would not return.
The servers were very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I was on vacation with my family this week in Tempe. I thought it was so cool how they give you a tour of the kitchen. I had never seen anything like that before. Our server shane was was extremely knowledgeable. He suggested the sausage and arugula pizza and the brussel sprouts. Both of which were amazing. Next time I'm in town I'm absolutely going back."}
{"text":"The food is a step up above Stouffer's. We didn't know this was a family style dining place until the server told us. But this wasn't the issue. We got the baked Ziti and garlic mashed potatoes. The pasta I'll give a 3/5 the mashed potatoes a 2/5. Definitely not worth the price. Overall, the service was good though."}
{"text":"this place is awful, the food is also awful.  Noisey enviroment.  definately, i will no go back .  I wish yelp would have a spot for no stars.  I would even give one!"}
{"text":"This may have been one of the worst buca restaurants I have been to! Cold food, long wait for a reservation made prior and the manager needs to learn better customer service!! 

We definitely won't come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Service is top notch, atmosphere is why we come and the food isn't bad. Not great, not bad, but decent. Shrimp Diablo is solid. 

Would give it 5 stars but their security guard had a staring problem. I get it, there's some beautiful women walking in but come on. You're supposed to be there to make guests feel safe, not weirded out. Was a bad way to start our evening"}
{"text":"Much better than I expected. I agree with EJay and Rich.
Lots of food, loved the salad with granny smith apples and walnuts.
Every inch of the place is covered in italian decorations and the place feels cramped at times, areas are sectioned off into smaller sets of like 6-10 tables, feels like a maze to navigate.
Staff seems overpowering, not sure if it sounds scripted but to have a young guy pushing alcohol and appetizers is not welcoming to me

Might be good for a date if you like the same food or want to feel 'cute'.

Will definitely come back for take-out because of the portions!"}
{"text":"Would have given no stars, but had to give one to post review. This just a chain restaurant, with can and frozen foods. 

Unless you're a large party would not recommend, or if you have never had authentic Italian food. 

Was just here, price of food not worth it. Service was non existent, waiting for order to be taken was inexcusable. 

They seem to be more interested in the partied over 8 due to the automatic tip added to check. As for the food spaghetti marinara was lukewarm quickly became cold, tasted like can tomatos, broccoli Romano came out cold. Broccoli was raw barely blacked. 

Never saw waitress until requested check."}
{"text":"I love this Restaurant! the food is great, service is awsome and the drinks are stout! this place has a great feel to it."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to with a number of friends or family members. All the dishes are prepared family style, serving either 3 or 5 people...with very good sized portions for each person.
The three of us ordered two dishes, with the assumption that there would be a doggy bag, and there was. We had spaghetti and meatballs and Spicy Chicken Rigatoni. There was a basket of fresh bread included; we could have ordered a garlic bread as an extra side. The bread was very nice when served, but very dry by dinner's end. It was served with a mix of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, but I asked for, and received butter to spread.
I was not a fan of the meatballs. I am not sure why I did not care for them. It may have been simply the texture as they (2 large meatballs on our platter) were very soft, falling apart easily. The spaghetti was great.
The chicken dish was much more to my liking as not only were the noodles easier to eat(rigatoni), but  it also had a nice seasoning in the sauce. There was a nice amount of bite-sized chicken pieces in the dish.
There is a very funny part of the ad near the entrance to Buca. They advertise that they have a very nice bathroom. It was not a bad bathroom, but I have certainly seen nicer ones in many other restaurants."}
{"text":"Been to this location mainy times and so far everytime has been good.  once they had a hard time keeping up with drinks but that was the only fault that i have found.  food is great and portions are huge and we always walkout with leftovers.  prices are moderate but you can always find coupons or online deals to help offset the prices.  we will be back again!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice and the food is amazing. Someone wrote here that the food tastes like it's either frozen or straight out of a can. I've had frozen italian and canned italian. The first thing you notice when eating at Buca is how FRESH the food tastes. Even the herbs in it seem quite fresh and complimentary.  someone also wrote that the atmosphere was loud and that they sang birthday songs a lot. Well to get around that my advice is to eat at home. This an italian restaurant. Nothing should be quiet about it! Enjoy the food, enjoy the cuture and go home. Some people will complain about ANYTHING."}
{"text":"The food, people atmosphere, environment and service is exceptional at Bucca, I have eaten hear several time alone, with just my wife, with my wife and daughters, with my wife daughter and a couple friends and even with large groups of 50 plus people. In every instance I was amazed at how friendly and grateful their employees treated everyone. I will give one small disclaimer if you are an easily offended person not only should you never leave a review for anyone but you probably should just stay home instead of going to a place that celebrates the history of Italian food. All of you at Bucca should be proud of your business and what you have accomplished. Keep up the exceptional service. I will continue to come to Bucca and we are planning to have our Christmas party at you restaurant again this year in December. Most likely our party will be between 80-100 guests. I hope your all ready for my company."}
{"text":"Great service in the bar area which had good happy hour specials. We shared a lasagna which is one of the best lasagna's ever!"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour and 20 minutes and never got seated. Manager did not even come out to manage the chaos outside.

Never again"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing here & last night I went in with my boyfriend and Hector helped us out and made a great recommendation on the stuffed chicken! 

Thanks Hector for your awesome service & for your great recommendation!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go!  The food is served family style.  We went there for my Dad's birthday and there were 15 of us but they accommodated us nicely.  The bread is especially awesome.  Love it with the oil and vinegar.  The only complaint I have is the acoustics.  It can get loud in there.  Kind of reminds me of the Macaroni Grill in this regard."}
{"text":"Whet to this place with some friend and didn't like it too much. One of our biggest complaints is the poor service. It took about 45 minutes to get our food after ordering and were not checked on infrequently. By the waiter. We were on the second floor, which might have attributed to the poor service. But there is an elevator I saw some of the servers using.

This place is on the higher end of moderately priced. They only have two sizes, small and large. Small feeds 2 - 3 while the large feeds 4 - 5. We did it family style which seemed to be more efficient. I wouldn't come here thinking you can get a individual meal for a that is inexpensive.

Overall the food was pretty good.

The arrowhead area is really nice. There is a lot of stuff to do. Parking is easy but can get full on the weekend.

I will probably try this place again. The bad service we got was probably not the norm."}
{"text":"You will not leave Buca di Beppo hungry, unless you only order water! Every time I've visited this restaurant I have been pleased with what I've ordered.  It might be the most authentic, but it's pretty darn good.  If you're in the need to feed a hungry crowd, look no further!"}
{"text":"Parking is a little awkward but not a problem.  Easy to get to.

I like the eclectic decor. Lots of lights and sights.

Celebrated my aunts birthday here and we were happily satisfied.

Came in for lunch and it wasn't busy yet, which was perfect.  We were seated immediately and was able to place our order within minutes. 

Drinks and appetizers came out fast! 

Enjoyed the salad and fruitti di late as well as the double chocolate cake. 

The complimentary bread was good and filling and was paired with the olive oil and pepper.

Loved the set up with the lit candles to blow out for the birthday celebrant.  The staff goes out of their way to make your party feel special.

Excellent food and service.

Kudos Buca Di Beppo team! 

Be back again when I'm in town to celebrate future birthdays."}
{"text":"A great spot to bring the family if your love Italian food. They serve large portions or larger portions! They only have family style servings, so make sure you pick something you all can agree on. I highly recommend the spicy chicken rigatoni. Also, the mini meatballs are a great appetizer. Odds are you will have leftovers, so you get to enjoy this food more than once!"}
{"text":"i felt like i was going back in time to the 50's or earlier......

it looked so authentic, they really put some time into this place. i really felt like i was going into some old house converted into a restaurant.

even down to the hair tonic and combs in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom.


and you WALK THROUGH THE KITCHEN to get to the bathroom. i thought it was the coolest thing i've ever seen.


the prices are high....but the portions make up for it.

the italian heroes on the wall in pictures was a cool touch as well."}
{"text":"First visit: We ordered a pizza from the menu on the wall. The ingredients were olives and tomatoes. When pizza came it was covered in onions, and there were a smattering of small chopped olives and tomatoes..it looked like an onion tart. My kids refused...to eat this. We also had to go get our own tea and water, as our waitress forgot, she never refilled...we did that too.

Another visit: my daughter wanted to have her birthday dinner there with some friends. We made reservations months in advance and called day before to confirm. They were confused when we got there....didn't acknowledge we were waiting...and finally took us into the dining room. They tried to sit us at a too small booth that had a huge tear in the seat. NO. We finally got our seat at a table that was actually large enough for all of us...service was spotty. 

on to the food. There is nothing spectacular about anything they serve. It tastes like chef boy rdee, or frozen dinners. Serving family style is nice, but it is akward to go with friends and do this. 

Last visit 4 of us went....3 of us were sick for several days after...2 ended up at emergency room for IV...1 went to doctor for phenegren.....we will not be back after that experience for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We went there with a party of 10 after the Arizona Winds Concert Band season finale and had THE most wonderful dinner!!! It was my first time there and you can be sure I'll be a regular from now on !!!Francis was our server and she was outstanding !!! Very pleasant and helpful and right on top of things !!!  The food was incredible and I'm just disappointed I hadn't tried it sooner. 
I cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Made reservations days in advance for 645pm arrived at 630and was finally seated 45 min later. Girl running the check in desk was very confused and seemed to loose track of everything. My party was asked if we wanted indoor or out door seating 15 min apart. She kept telling us our table was being cleared but they kept seating others. Finally after 45 min they did seat us offered no apologies or anything"}
{"text":"Not an impressive restaurant for the second time. First time I placed a large to go order of fettuccine supremo only to get home to a dry pan of noodles with  one chicken breast. I called and spoke with the manager to express my disappointment, and he was sorry and he presented the resolution of a gift card. Giving the restaurant another chance, tonight I ordered Shrimp Fra Diavola. I made sure I asked for extra sauce(just in case). Needless to say I was disappointed again! Who puts 10 shrimp in a large pan of penne noodles that is supposed to feed at least 4 people(seriously I counted).  Thanks but no thanks Buca, I'll stick with Vapiano's, you might want to take a page of their book of quality."}
{"text":"We went for dinner while we were in Vegas. Food was very good. Waitress was very nice and friendly, explained everything to us as it was our first time there. Price was good. We stayed at the Luxor and walk over. We would go back again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have dine at this particular location many times and I have always been very satisfied with their service up until yesterday.
I came in with a party of 9 people due to my little brother's birthday. The food was exceptional and I enjoyed it but our server was slow. We waited maybe about 25 minutes for our food and after we ate, we waited for another 35 minutes for him to acknowledge the fact that we wanted to order dessert. (we mentioned multiple times that we were celebrating a birthday) We still received slow service from our waiter. Why? He was too busy talking to his coworkers. I get it. It was slow and he may just wanted to take his \"time.\" It bothers me that this particular waiter doesn't believe in exceptional customer service and instead would rather blow off his customers. 
We should have just told the waiter to pack our dessert to-go. It shouldn't have taken 25 minutes to give us our dessert. After we were done we waited again for him to acknowledge that we wanted to pay already. Really? My family and I were fed up. He's lucky that my parents tipped him 25 bucks. He shouldn't have gotten any tip for the poor service he gave us."}
{"text":"I had forgotten why I don't frequent these chains, but now I remember. I'm embarrassed that I even asked the bf to take me here after all the places we're used to eating in NYC.

Then complained about everything........:/ the place was dirty... food all over the floor and our \"freshly\" cleaned table has food stuck on it.. waitress brought bread that was still doughy on the inside and side she'd be back with some olive oil.... it never came until I asked for it and new bread when our food came. When our food came it was dropped on our table like a hot potato and nothing was said.... I at least expected they would say.... ENJOY!!!! Let's just say this will be the last time I frequent this so called Italian restaurant:/"}
{"text":"wife absolutely loves this place.  I don't get it.  it's good but certainly nothing special.  however tommy lasorda yelling for everyone to say they love the dodgers was pretty epic!!! caesars salad is good but highly recommend the apple gorgonzola salad! garlic bread is strong enough to kill vampires.  baked ziti was pretty bland. the stuffed chicken thing was pretty decent.  meh. next."}
{"text":"It was so dusty in the restaurant itself. The food wasn't very good or even cooked well, the wait staff wasn't friendly... generally disappointed in this location, won't be returning unfortunately. I honestly can't believe that this is next to some really great eateries."}
{"text":"Staff was busy and unresponsive, while having secret conversations at the bar with open seating. Obviously food portions were big, however not worth it. Did not feel very warm, like your big Italian family dinners."}
{"text":"My friend from out of town and I came here on her last night because i was recommended by an associate of mine. I was incredibly disappointed. It's a monday night, three tables in the dining room (as far as i could tell) the server never told us his name, and seemed frazzled from the get-go. That should have been our cue to leave, but we decided to stick around for a bit. The service was simply awful, and I'm pretty easy to please, as I've waited tables for over five years The food was mediocre at best, the caesar salad was probably the best thing that we ordered. 

i will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place because of it's unique style. It's more of a home style feel than your uppity Italian restaurant. They serve in portions for 2 or more to share food like a traditional Italian household. The food is good and my waiter was great!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in the mood for Italian but didn't want to travel too far on a cold winter evening and we didn't want to spend too much.  So we decided to try buca di beppo at Southpark Mall. 

 We were not aware that we could not order individual meals.  But OK...we both like chicken marsala and salad...so we opted for that.  However....the \"small\" chicken marsala said to feed 2-3 people was 3 breasts covered in butter and mushrooms. This came with no sides.  So we ordered A small cesar salad that feeds 2-3.  And a side of plain pasta covered in what seemed like crushed tomatoes out of a can.  There was barely enough for two people.   Pretty much flavorless.  My daughter had a soda and I had water.  Our bill was $55!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I cannot even express to you my disappointment in this meal......and the price!!!!!!!!

If I hadn't been out with my daughter I would have really complained.  Not that in today's society it would have made much difference.  

But be assured I will NEVER visit this chain restaurant again.  It was simply awful food.  Service was minimal and the bread was gross too.

The only thing this place has going for it is atmosphere.  It's cute.  But you can get authentic Italian cuteness in little Italy with much better food and appropriate prices."}
{"text":"We share an antipasto salad and penne cardinale...both were excellent.  First time back in quite some time and we really enjoyed the food.  Service was excellent, we sat in the bar area."}
{"text":"Food did not come out with the rest of the table's. After 20 minutes we had to cancel our food and got no apology. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"This place is in the mall in Champaign. Atmosphere 5 stars, cozy and romantic. Service 5 stars, could not have been better. Food 4 stars. I had the eggplant parma. which I would give 5 stars. Friend had the veggie pizza which she gave 4 stars. The bread was kind of boring and the dipping sauce not the best. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food! Lots of pictures to just view and have fun looking at them. Also guessing who the people in the pictures. I had a great time here with my friends and the Sundae that we had was huuge!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the place, it can get busy and noisy but the food is worth it. Meatballs the size of baseballs and good family style portions. I usually get a large tray to go and me and the family enjoy it, I find coupons for $10 off so for around $25 I can feed 4-6 people something good."}
{"text":"Restaurant was dirty and shabby . May be better for huge groups but would never eat here on a date . Food is typical american / italian not anything special ."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Wednesday.   
When we were seated, they walked us through the kitchen- which I thought was strange and unsanitary.   What restaurant walks guests through the kitchen to seat them?   The food was decent enough.  Huge portions - enough for 2-3; but if you each want something different, it will cost you.  The meat sauce was surprisingly very good.   Everything is ala carte- including dinner salad and sides.   We had the green bean blend side and I was assured they were fresh green beans.   They were definitely frozen but decent enough.  
I would call it just an ok dinner.  Not horrible but not a place I would go to again.  
I think the walk through the kitchen really turned me off from the get go.   Can't imagine how many people have been walked through that kitchen coughing or sneezing or whatever.   gross"}
{"text":"Family style Italian restaurant that serves up your typical Italian fare. I think the food and sevice is better than other casual Italian restuarants I've been to. If you go with a party of two, I recommend just getting a salad and entree and that should be enough. If you go with more people then you could order more entrees or opt for the larger sized plates. The entrees are large because they are meant to be shared, hence a family style restaurant. If it's your first time here they will explain the menu and plate sizes to you. I have only been here a couple times, but look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Great place, off course, delicious Italian food with great family environment.  Their food portions are incredible. I have been going to Buca di Beppo for over 20 years, and I will for another 1000 years."}
{"text":"Awesome place and environment.  Went here with my wife and kids.  They had a great time.  Actually met the manager Raymond.  He made sure everything was perfect and we had a good experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Marsala here. I've had Chicken Marsala elsewhere and I always seem to get some gravy mess, but here it's just like a wine sauce, like it should be. They make it with their own Marsala wine, but they don't sell it to the public.  :("}
{"text":"Well...what can I say about this place. 

The look of this place looks like it was decorated by a 7 year. There are so many colors through out this place, it was borderline feeling like being at a circus. 

We entered around 130pm and the place was empty. We were sat at a table and when we asked for the happy hour they talked about. We were told we had to go to the bar are to get the special so we were moved.

Ordered one of the lunch special and it came out quickly. The meat and sauce were good however the noodles were very hard. I did not when finish my food.

The cheese sticks were good and also hot. Best part of the meal.

The server although nice was slow. He would leave to get something for us and would return 5 mintues later.

I do not ever see myself returning."}
{"text":"Overall great experience! This was my second time dining here and the food isn't upsetting :) Portion is big enough for 2-4ppl and that includes the desserts! I'm a huge dessert critic. The tiramisu was so delicious, creamy and not too sweet, a bowl fed at least 4 of us. I guessed they made it fresh, it wasn't dripping with condensation from sitting in a fridge(my experience from other restaurants). The cheesecake was a bit too sweet for my likes :("}
{"text":"The smell when you walk in the place is pretty good. Especially when it is cold outside.
There is a wonderful smell of sauce and spice cooking. Love it.
The staff here is friendly and the decor is great!
It is always a busy place. They recently put coupons out so that makes them even busier.
Food is very good here. Nice and hot as well.
It can get beyond loud when everyone is in here. This is a trend i have noticed more than once. Lots of noise.
But, food is good and the price is great. Bathrooms are clean.
Sounds like a plan!"}
{"text":"Bummer.. way to long a wait and not just to be seated on a Wednesday night. We ordered 2 of the easiest things! Mussels that should take no time at all and spaghetti and meatballs. The mussels we good. A few unopened not edible. The spaghetti was over cooked and swimming in water. The upkeep is dismal at best. No pride in the maintenance. Photos missing, old carpet that smelled of beer. We had so many good memories here. Disappointed we won't be back. Our waiter did his best."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Over cooked pasta, EVERY TIME!!!  Their claim to fame is the amount of food served. Too bad the food you get is awful."}
{"text":"I've only experienced the Buca experience one time years ago, so when it was mentioned as an option I was more than open. We decided to get it to go since we had tons of kids with us. 

I just want to start by saying this place lacks the understanding of customer service and I feel it's been forgotten that these employees wouldn't be employed if it were not for paying customers, but just an opinion. 

We walked in and passed 3 employees, one was even a host! Not ONE word in acknowledgement was spoken to us in the first 4 minutes. Worse, we walked up to the \"to go\" window and someone was actually standing there, she looks up and walks away.  FINALLY, Jacqueline says hello and begins to help us. We tell her our name, our order and that we have a coupon. She looks at it and first tells us that the coupon can't be used at that location. We show her on the coupon where it says that location SPECIFICALLY. She then says something along the lines that her manager told her earlier that they can't use them. I ask why, she says she doesn't know just that her manager said they can't. I then ask to speak to her manager, she comes back and says he's busy right now but he said the coupon can only be used on Easter Sunday. I then show her on the coupon that it says EASTER WEEKEND specifically on the coupon. She then begins to stutter (mind you she's already given me multiple reasons why it can't be used). She then goes on to say how again her manager says it cant be used and how SHE has no control over it. I then ask ok \"so its just bad marketing then right, since it says easter weekend, only on to go orders and your location\" (all requirements we met). She was definitely struggling for words at this point. Then I asked \"and your manager is too busy right now to talk to a customer? Its ok, I just want to make sure we are on the same page, that's all?\" She slyly shakes her head in aggreance and then I ask for her managers card.  She left to get one is what I assumed but within 15 seconds she returns with her manager, Dereck (I believe he mumbled his name was). 

He then apologized and explained how there are so many coupons out there \"people are using\" that he can't keep them all straight. Just some advice, as a manager never admit you have no clue what is being used as marketing for your place of business. It makes you look unorganized as a business, with management that isn't fully informed. 

Long and short, 20 min later and an irritated customer later we were able to use the coupon. Thing is it wasn't even about the coupon honestly we could have cared less about it since it was only a few bucks but the lack of concern, service and hospitality that we received from the get go was what topped off what I will classify as a horrible Buca experience. Doubt I'll go back and I wouldn't recommend it either."}
{"text":"This is the place to get cheap drinks while waiting to get into Thunder From Down Under next door. Their happy hour runs all day and includes $2 beer and $5 cocktails. There's hardly anyone here in the evenings too so service is fast. Load up ladies because you'll need it!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want to eat overpriced Chef Boyardee.  Nothing tasted fresh or homemade.  The food was incredibly bland and tasted as though it had been reheated in a microwave.  Sloppy presentation. Never in my life have I had to send a dish back until visiting this joint and all I ordered was pasta!  How does an \"Italian\" restaurant mess up pasta?!  This place makes Olive Garden look like a 3 star Michelin restaurant. You couldn't pay me to return."}
{"text":"I probably like this place more than others. The decorum is unique in a good way.  I had the salad with feta, spaghetti and meat sauce, and the Tiramisu for dessert.  This place will not win any awards, but the food is somewhat tasty and you will not leave hungry.  Note: You can really taste the alcohol in the Tiramisu."}
{"text":"The food here is horrific. The shrimp pasta had the same shrimp as the ones you will find in your cup of noodles. I've ate at Buca di Beppo before and hadn't gone back cause it sucked and well, they haven't gotten any better. Save your money and just eat out of the snack machine, it's very comparable. Chef Boyardi is rolling over in his grave, it ain't right, leave that man alone!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food was not.  We ordered prescheudo stuffed chicken.  The dish cane out on the verge of being cold and competely lacked flavor.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"I had an unfortunate experience here today. We placed a to-go order via phone, and when I arrived to pick up the order, it was pre-bagged, and all items were checked off (as if they were included). This $90 meal was ordered for my uncles birthday dinner, which included a Cesar salad (he's diabetic), and two other items. We were charged for the salad, but it was not included. Because he is on a strict diet, the salad was going to serve as the main part of his meal. Understanding that things happen, I called the restaurant within a few moments, and a male placed me on hold mid-sentence. I remained on hold for 5 minutes. After I gave up and disconnected, my mom and I repeatedly tried to call the restaurant for 1.5 hours, but no one answered the phone. It would ring and ring, then loop back to the automated system. 

I recommend checking your bags yourself to ensure that all items are included, and going in person to speak to someone. Apparently the phone line isn't a priority here."}
{"text":"Visited the Buca in Vegas, everything we had was scrumptious, salad was yummy, baked manacotti, so light and delicious, and the meatballs were perfectly seasoned and cooked just right, they had a nice marinara over them. We enjoyed the bread as well- we had two orders of it! My only personal disappointment was that they only served Pepsi and I am a Coke drinker! But I just ordered iced tea and settled that! It was a great experience, and they even took a lovely photo of us, which we purchased."}
{"text":"Folding table, warm wine, cold mash potatoes and a forgotten order...not their best night."}
{"text":"Thanks to my annual birthday Buca requirement combined with a 50% off pasta deal today, I discovered that my favorite family style restaurant is also a great place for a solo diner, because of the delightful bar area!

Brittany (spelling may vary) the bartender, and the \"milkshake maestro\"* whose name I didn't get were great to chat with and Brittany knows her stuff (easily troubleshooting my half correct ecertificate number, and quickly identifying the last remaining Buca in Florida :P) 

I should add that the \"small\" spaghetti and meatballs here is my favorite pasta dish to order anywhere, because I KNOW that I can scarf down as much as I want, and still have another entire round 2 meal for later that day (or the following breakfast :D) if anyone wants to share, I go large and we add spicy sausage to the deal!

I will surely be dining here on a whim more often, company optional!

*- no they dont have milkshakes... I was excited like you are now and then similarly bummed too, sorry!"}
{"text":"We ate the cheese bread with alfredo sauce and the trio of baked pastas, and something didn't agree with either of us.  We basically wasted one of our Vegas nights (my aunt's birthday celebration to boot) because we were feeling so crappy after eating at Buca di Beppo in Excalibur.  One extra star for decent service at the bar."}
{"text":"If you've ever gone you'd know they are a bit on the high side when it comes to prices, but it's well worth it. We went around 9:45 P.M. on a Saturday and there was maybe 4 other occupied tables. Our waiter Richard was very nice and attentive. Our food came fast and it was very good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a family style Italian place...Buca is the place to be! Their portions are meant to be shared and they're seriously, not even kidding, super filling.

Came here a few times, but my most recent visit was for my sisters birthday. We ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni which is penne pasta with chicken and peas, and also has a kick to it (sooo good! Probably my favorite pasta here), the shrimp florentine which is a garlic flavored pasta with shrimp (honestly was not my favorite, tasted very placid and needed like 10 pounds of salt!), the Italian broccoli Romano which is practically just broccoli with salt and pepper, and the chicken saltimbocca which are chicken breasts served with artichoke hearts and lemon. This was plenty to feed 5-6 of us!!! 

Each entree comes with either a small or a large plate. I would recommend ordering a small if it's you and one other person. Because like I said...their portions are HUGE. 

Here's a tip: if you go online on their website and subscribe, they will send you a coupon for a free pasta on your next visit! Super worth it if you're always here. Make sure you check your email because that's where they'll send it, usually the day after.

Till next time Buca!"}
{"text":"So, I went to Buca di Beppo a couple of months ago as I was in P-burgh for a meeting.  I hadn't eaten since the morning and was very hungry and thought I would drop in for an early dinner.  Bad idea.

I came in alone and not with a group and I came in early.  Not really their target demographic; however, they had no idea what to do with me.  So what did they do with me?  The put me in some back room near a kitchen.  Just me, some gangster memorabilia, big band music... and an empty room near the kitchen.  I eventually found a server and told him that I would eat at the bar, you know, where there are other people...

They let me order off the lunch menu, that was nice, so I ordered a lunch portion spaghetti.  Another bad idea.  The spaghetti sauce was terrible, tasted like catsup, the pasta was \"old\" and seemed like it had been in the refrigerator for a couple of days and the meatball tasted like they walked over to McDonalds and asked for some hamburger meat.

I realize that Buca really isn't structured to serve the one-man early-dinner customer.  And that is another drawback.  The place is located in a business center area.  They need to know who their potential customers are.

The Station Square location is kind of odd, it is tucked in by the river between the tunnels.  However, just walk across that cool bridge and find a local place across the river in the down town area.  Avoid Buca unless you are with a big group and want a pasta-heavy meal.  Actually, there are Italian restaurants across the river or further up Carson.  Just avoid Buca.

Not going back to Buca, in any city.

Aside, P-burgh is a cool town and I can't wait for my next trip back."}
{"text":"I have loved going to Buca for years.  
This past Sunday, 9/18/16 I had a craving for their chicken lemone.   The chicken used to be prepared by being hammered flat and served with the lemone sauce on top.   When my food arrived the chicken was the same as if you cooked a boneless chicken breast.   There was very little sauce on it.  The side of spaghetti was very small and not much marina sauce on it.
The side salad was very good. My server was excellent.
I never did complain but, swore Buca off my go to restaurants for a while.
The booth right beside mine had a mother, her little boy and grand parents.  They allowed the boy to talk loudly throughout the meal and he kept saying, \" Mom your food looks yucky!\"
Come on Mom this is not your house. Your disregard for other peoples enjoyment is rude.  Next time go to McDonald's where all the kids are screaming and your son will blend in.
I should have asked to move but, didn't.  Wish I had."}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the Buca di Trio, fried calamari was sooo good. We also had the Supremo pizza with our appetizers. For our entrees we had the Shrimp Florentine & Stuffed Chicken. Our waitress/bartender/cashier/ all jobs in one...lol Brittany was the bestest ever!!! Give this lady a raise!!! We will be coming back, and soon! Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for our family dinner before my son's surgery tomorrow. We had amazing food and our server Jarrett was amazing! Thank you very much Jarrett for making our family dinner a great one!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now so I can give them a proper review.
THey always try to get you a seat as quickly as they can and the staff is above friendly. 
We came here on Saturday night for a quick dinner.  We were seated very quickly.
We got a booth in a very loud room. There were a lot of teenagers there so the noise was unreal. We could not hear the waitress, we had to yell and so did she.
Our waitress was a sweet girl named Megan. She was very sorry about all the noise and said it should end soon. 
2 of the tables finally left but, the one that stayed had 7 of the loudest teens I have ever experianced in a Public place. 
Anyway,never mind all that.        The Food!!  So many choices to be had, We ended up by getting a mixed plate of stuffed shells and Cantonolis, It is called Quattro al Forno. 
Plus we had bread first with vinegar and Olive Oil. We were not too hungry this day, so it was really a lot of food. 

They have really great starters, the Calamari is fantastic.
We did not have dessert but, we saw some of the desserts being brought to other tables.  The Ice Cream Sundae is huge,all served in a giant Maritini glass. 

Everything is family style so keep that in mind when you order. There is a lot of food here. Great place to have a party or family get together.
 The staff works really hard here, I do not know how the can do it everyday. The noise is just over the top.

Another thing that is a little differant is you walk through the Kitchen to get to the dining area. You can even make reservations to get a table in the kitchen. 
Which surprised me is very popular to do."}
{"text":"Buca sponsored our last three races! We love them and our runners love them! Great tasting food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Italian food? (If you don't, just go with it.) I'm definitely a fan of Buca's food, not their service. Even on a slow night, everything takes forever. I know that every time I want to eat at Buca's, I'll have to prepare myself for the monologue from the waitress. If it involved their food specials, I'd be fine with it. Instead, I'm borderline harassed to fill out a card. No thanks. The only other issue I had was when they ran out of mozzarella.

They. Ran. Out. Of. Mozzarella.

I'm pretty sure I asked the waitress to repeat herself seeing as how mozzarella was on every single dish I wanted to order. I pressed on. I mean, it's common for an Italian restaurant to be out of a main ingredient, right? ...

Anyway, as far as the food, I'm a fan. I always order their stuffed mushroom appetizer, which could very well be an entree. Also, I make sure to share a dish with someone because there's no way one person could polish off all that pasta. (If you can and do, congrats!) I've never been disappointed with their food. I try a new dish every time I go, which isn't normal for me, but I know the menu's descriptions are accurate.

Some dishes I enjoy: Ravioli al Pomodoro, Spicy Chicken Rigatoni, Linguine Frutti di Mare, Gnocchi al Telefono, and Chicken Carbonara."}
{"text":"In need of a place to take a large group of people? Want to take your kids but need to save money? Then Buca is for you! With 4 kids and a tight wallet my wife and I look for place where kids eat free or the food is cheap and plentiful. While Buca doesn't offer kids free food they do offer GREAT food at a reasonable price with portions large enough to SHARE and SPARE. 

The dinning experience is great! The restaurant is split into semiprivate rooms with only a few tables in each space. There is a real family feel here! Although, the photo's and art that decorates the walls have sparked some interesting conversations with my 7 year old the decor is really fun! 

I certainly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a great place to bring a group. The pricing is great for those who like to do family style. Luckily, since it was me and by bf and we went at 3pm, they have a lunch menu with individual portions. Which were still very big and filling... and delicious!

Had no room for dessert unfortunately.. but will try them next time! Maybe if I can gather 6 people, we can try to colossal brownie sundae thing! YUM

Its also a good place for catering and parties. Very roomy restaurant (kinda separated rooms for a bit more privacy if needed) but not enough parking! You gotta park in the business plaza next to it... but that's not a big deal."}
{"text":"The best garlic bread, chopped antipasto salad and spaghetti and meatballs.  Our favorite restaurant whenever we are in Phoenix or Anaheim."}
{"text":"Terrible slow forgetful service!  Worst Eggplant Parm ever!! Tough & chewy.. a dish that used to be my favorite @ Buca.. and now the worst!   A 45 min lunch took 2 hours!!  FAREWELL Buca di POOPOO!!"}
{"text":"Jarrett was our server and he was super amazing. He walked us through the menu and had lots of good recommendations. The food and service here were beyond good!"}
{"text":"We come here every 3 to 4 months and every time we are wowed! Today Jarrett our server and Hailey the manager didn't disappoint......  it's cold bring a jacket..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for traditional Italian food. This is a great place for a large group or a couple, all of their dishes come family style in a small or large portion. I have had their baked rigatoni with meatballs, spaghetti with meatballs, and their rigatoni with spicy Italian sausage. All of these dishes were cooked perfectly using just the right amount of sauce and cheese. The meatballs are super moist and have great flavor. Now when it comes to desserts I am always a sucker for their Tiramisu which is amazing and is great even as left overs. Overall I love coming to Buca di Beppo for a great Italian meal, they are light on the wallet even with having portions so large you are almost certain to bring home some left overs :-)"}
{"text":"Overall I had a poor experience. The only thing half decent about the meal was the service. Came with a large group which I have to say was good because of how large the portions are. Overall taste of the food was very sub par. Started with some calamari that was very dry and rubbery. Then all the pasta dishes we had were poorly seasoned and very over cooked. Good service bad food"}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night, and it was swamped.  We waited a little while, but did get seated in a reasonable amount of time.    Talk about overpriced and not very good.  We both got the spaghetti and there was hardly any sauce on it, so we asked for a side dish, and the size of the side dish of sauce (for both of us) was laughable.  It had a decent taste, that's why there's two stars instead of one.  I had to ask again for more sauce, and they brought us another little tiny dish of sauce.   And we also sat there for a good long time with empty soda glasses.  I would never go back to this place."}
{"text":"I can't believe there was a Buca in Summerlin and I didn't know about it! Been driving all the way down to the E Flamingo location all this time! We visited this location on a Sunday night and were seated in booths in the bar area, which was perfect because football was on TV. Although the bartender was our server, he was pretty quick and came back many times to check on us throughout the meal. 

There was 4 of us so we opted for a large proscuitto stuffed chicken (5 pieces) and a large baked rigatoni (don't do it, it's HUGE! - 2 lbs worth). Needless to say, we finished the chicken but had plenty of pasta leftover. This is the first time I've ever had leftovers at Buca, so I was surprised when we asked for a box, the waiter came by and packed our pasta into boxes for us and threw in bags of warm bread as well. 

This location doesn't get as crowded as the Flamingo location, however, you can make reservations as well if you'd like. We had a great time/meal here and I'll definitely be back, especially because I wanted to try their dessert but we were all too full to attempt it..."}
{"text":"We live close to this restaurant and we love going there often! It is good for the family with small kids, the food is very good, servers are always nice and kind. Ricardo has been our server for a couple of last times and he is a great guy! We keep on going there. Oh... and their cannoli are the best in town!!!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation and went last night. I'm glad I did because it was packed!  I didn't have to wait long to get seated. My waitress was awesome. I ordered calamari which was pretty good. We also ordered the baked ziti which was ok. It needed a little more seasoning. Even though I've been to Buca before I was scared to come here because of all the bad reviews. Sometimes you have to experience things for yourself but I'm glad I went."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I had at Vegas..!
Sausage and pepper and the stuffed shell with ricotta and sausage...!
I sure will come back here and the service was good!"}
{"text":"they served us giant bowls of pasta for our party of at least 10 people, so much that with our left overs we could probably do it again at home. The spaghetti and monster half pound meat balls were excellent. We also had Bruschetta, Penne Basilica, and some other dishes. 

They have some much good food to choose from that I really wished they made smaller portions or we hand more people so that I could try all of the dishes. I LOVE ITALIAN FOOD. 

The walls are full with so much random pictures, they even have a pope room where if you wanted to dine with pope in the middle of the table. So be sure to look around before, after, or even during your meal. 

I would have like them to serve us complimentary slices of Italian bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, as most places I've been to do, but it was extra. 

when buying with a large group try buying just one of the large dishes, they said it feeds around 6 people, i might agree except i could really put down some italian food,"}
{"text":"Nothing special. I've been to Buca di Beppo multiple times and not once did I ever crave to come back for another meal I've  always just though it was ok. But this last visit will probably be my last, from the food to the service I just was not pleased , We placed the order based on other yelp reviews and got the spicy chicken rigatoni, it came out super fast I thought it was too good to be true, and of course it was. 
It was so bland it tasted like boiled pasta, we asked to send it back and they resent it the same way, we could hardly eat it, so we asked for marinara sauce and another waitress brought it out with an attitude. And the rest of the servers along with who I am guessing was the manger on deity were discussing and contemplating who would get the next large table right next to our table in such an unprofessional way. Even the water tasted awful! All in all the only thing we actually enjoyed was the bread that came with the bruschetta ,that was really good! Yet the bruschetta was filled with onions so it killed it for me, but the other two seemed to enjoy it. Sorry Buca this was another disappointing visit."}
{"text":"This review is not for the food but for one of the male managers of the Peoria, AZ location.  He is an absolute tyrant.  I was dining at this establishment and witnessed him degrading and cussing out the young employees.  If I had not already eaten I would have walked out of this place it was disgusting and I will NOT be back to support this A**holes paycheck. I hope many of you won't either, drive the extra miles to a different location.  Who wants to support an establishment with a manager that does not care about embarrassing and degrading the employees in front of customers, NOT ME!"}
{"text":"I've been dining here for many many years and i will continue to do so due  to me being a pasta junkie and we are in Vegas at least once a month..Food is always great however service always seems to be a hit or miss,Staff has a real I don't care attitude and our last visit was really the worse experience in the history of ever.06/04/16...Again food was great as always,However we had to ask for bread several times,Our server disappeared and never returned a bus boy had to bring us bread after asking 3 times for bread from other servers,our meal was delivered by a strange server and after meal was dropped off the check was dropped off before we started the meal...
I have never had the check dropped off with meal delivery,
Anyway great food but the service and management are really in need of a house cleaning.."}
{"text":"What can I say, we ate here once and never went back! Got there at lunch and then ignored, finally got a waitress, brought our drinks and disappeared, so we waited! Finally she took our order, don't know who was cooking because I could have made it faster! I thought prices were a bit high for what we ordered! Husband was not pleased, and said well that's the last time we eat here! The food was not very good, he said I made better at home! We are still looking for good Italian food, so far having no luck!!"}
{"text":"Went here Sunday evening for dinner with my fiancé! Our sever and every person we interacted with was very friendly. The bread came out first with olive oil and balsamic. I liked it a lot! Next came the apple, walnut salad. Very fresh! Although the dressing was a bit bitter. For our main course we had baked ziti and a meatball. Both were delicious. 

Viewing and smelling the bathroom was disappointing! I had to hold my breath! Gross! I can see how some people call this place \"dirty\". It's sad because the food and people were great!"}
{"text":"Maybe it is cultural, but I do not like the food here. I want my own food  and not have to eat what everyone else wants.
We had a chicken dish last time with capers that was so dry that drinking water with it at the same time was a necessity. I felt like a raccoon.
It was too loud for us to have a real conversation and I didn't want to yell."}
{"text":"I have been to a number of Buca's across Phoenix.  I am a fan of the food and the unique atmosphere.  Perfect place to have a party, in fact I had my college graduation party here a few years back and it was a blast.  Place was designed for family sized gatherings.

My only gripe is that this place is not really designed for one or two people.  In smaller groups the bill seems very high and the portions seem to be a bit lacking, your wallet can take a real beating if you want to have a diverse experience.

Still I give this place a big thumbs up, just make sure you book a party and visit the pope room."}
{"text":"The food is served family style. We ordered spicy chicken and fettucine alfredo. The spicy chicken was spicy and tasted ok. The fettucine alfredo was very granular and seemed to come from a packet. The olive oil used with the bread had an off flavor almost like it was rancid. 

There are much better options for the price."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for $10.00 off a purchase of $20 and thought we could go and have a nice dinner. The ambiance is always fun and gaudy there. Makes me giggle a bit. I honestly have not been to a Buca di Beppo for about 8 years so I was excited to go based on my memories of having family dinners there and loving the food. Well, I guess maybe I got spoiled with better Italian food along the way because today's meal wasn't really as good as I remember. Maybe, my palette has changed over the years?  We started with fried calamari (all my boyfriend's), and mozzarella garlic bread. He said the calamari was a little chewy, not as crisp as he prefers, but he finished it all. The garlic bread is always nice there, but the bread seemed to taste a bit stale at the bottom. They always sliver fresh garlic over the bread. We shared the small eggplant parmesan with a side of spaghetti and it was ok. There were two stacked pieces of eggplant parm, breaded nicely, with a good amount of cheese. The spaghetti noodles were great, they were cooked perfectly!  All in all, I guess I didn't like their marinara. It seemed too acidic to me, like they dropped some vinegar in there accidentally or something. My bf makes sunday gravy and I guess I'm spoiled by that flavor that my tastebuds changed. Buca is a nice place to get together with friends and family for family style food, but it does get expensive."}
{"text":"A cozy, tasty experience!

THE UP-SIDE:  A huge space divided into many small, cozy rooms.  Every inch of this place is designed and decorated to give you the feeling of being in a good Italian friend's home; albeit, an Italian friend who's family came over years ago and hasn't redecorated since the early sixties!  Believe it or not, it really works and feels sorta cozy and homey.

The food is served in HUGE family-style portions and is meant to be shared between people dining.  They do not skimp on the portions, and everything I tried was quite tasty.

The place is usually packed with people all having a great time.  When I was there, nearly half the restaurant sang \"Happy Birthday\" to strangers that were celebrating.  It was odd, but nice.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  Yeah, it's corporate and manufactured to make you feel \"at home.\"  Something about that always bothers me.  The food isn't high-end, but it is very good for a chain.

THE SUM-IT-UP:  Look.  Sometimes you have to skip the unique, hip, little out of the way restaurant to dine with family and friends at a bigger, chain-type place.  If that's the case, and you find yourself struggling to make reservations for Mom and Dad, the grandparents, and a bunch of cousins, this is THE PLACE for you.

It's campy, cozy, very lively and fun.  And, the portions are tasty and huge!  So stop being too snobby for the suburbs and go here now!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming here. This is a family or group style restaurant. The portions are huge! If you get a small you can share with 3 people, large bowl you can share with 5 people. 

I had the spicy chicken rigatoni it's okay but to spicy. I also had the cheese ravioli it was good. The chicken carbonara is good. Also the baked rigatoni is good. The bruschetta wasn't really impressed with it's just tomatoes, onions & some cheese. Usually they give you bread & butter & some olive oil, but we had to ask for some. 


They usually sing for you if it's your birthday (different birthday song) & bring you a candelabra with candles to blow out. When I came for my birthday they didn't give me anything like cake or ice cream. They said they don't do that only the candles. But today we went for my friends birthday and they gave her an ice cream. So I don't know what else to say about that. 

This restaurant has 2 levels. Not sure if there is seating on the first floor cause they always brought us upstairs. They even have an elevator! Inside there's so many pictures every where. Every inch is covered! Where we sat there was wine glasses on the ceiling! Totally decorative! They do take reservations."}
{"text":"Say what you want about this place and shut up with the 'authentic' argument already- their chicken parm is BOMB! I don't care if purple people from china made this italian chicken, it doesn't lose it's credibility of flavor. at least not for me.

however, they lose 2 whole stars for price and dumb menu. seriously $20 for two chicken breasts? and nothing else? stupiddddddddd.

there are no other options for dinner either, its like get this huge plate of chicken for an overpriced amount, or nothing else. i personally opt for the kids meal- 1 chicken breast and side of spaghetti @ $6. that's more like it.

every window has a light up sign that say things like 'italian dinner' or 'come eat' or something. one of them says 'health inspected'. that is the weirdest thing i have ever seen. it just makes me wonder why it is necessary to point out that it is health inspected???"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. We would come back again. Staff was very attentive. Liquor cheap at the bar - Happy Hour all day!  The food was consistently fine as you would expect at a chain restaurant. Portions are huge! For Vegas a great value."}
{"text":"Here we are having dinner with our children (group of 12) and they sat a group directly behind us. This group is trying to have a good time of their own, but no way should have been seated next to us. I can see many other tables available. Major fail Buca :-("}
{"text":"This time we just ordered the tiramisu for take out. A couple girlfriends and I were having a girls night in and wanted something sweet! It was to die for! I've never had a bad experience there. Make sure you have at least 4 people going or plan to bring home leftovers! The food is fresh and tasty and the service is delightful! A little pricy for pasta dishes but as I said the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday a couple of weeks ago. I had driven past it a million times, but never realized what it was. When you walk in, you almost feel like you're at an Italian home. The typical checkered table, Christmas lights, vases.. very Italian atmosphere.

Everything served up family style, which I liked. We ordered stuffed chicken, stuffed pasta shells and Caesar salad. Everything was good. Not completely authentic, but decent Italian food. It's a bit pricey, but definitely a place that I would check out once a year or so."}
{"text":"I've been to two Bucas in NorCal (SF and Campbell). Went to this one on Flamingo Friday Dec23 and the staff was great. Ordered lasagna, spaghetti, and ravioli with spinach. Food was cooked perfectly (although I would prefer more sauce on the spaghetti). Meat was not undercooked. Pasta was not overcooked (like the Campbell location). Ordered to-go, so I can't judge the whole dining experience. Being off-strip, I hope they don't try to sell tableside photos (like the SF location). I'm visiting the city but I'm not a tourist. I just want good food. Yes it's pricey but they give you a lot."}
{"text":"Visited Peoria location Monday evening for dinner.   Hadn't been to Buca for quite some time, so decided to give it a try.   
Our waiter was fantastic.   Jarrett was attentive to our table, very pleasant, and did a fine job; no complaints regarding the service.
Quality of the food was not ideal.   We ordered our favorite item off their menu, the apple Gorgonzola salad.   Unfortunately, the produce was not the freshest.   The lettuce was a bit brown and my wife actually picked some pieces off.   I still ate it; but whole time I'm looking around a very empty restaurant, one that I remember as always having to wait to get a table, and wondering if this  decline of quality is reason why only a handful of tables were seated.   Our pasta dish, the spicy chicken rigatoni, was fine; no complaints there. 
Hope our experience this time is the exception rather than the rule as I remember really enjoying the place when they first came into the valley.   But looking at the number of tables sat, and cars in the parking lot compared to other restaurants in the immediate area, I'm thinking it may be indicative of overall current quality.   Hope they turn it around."}
{"text":"Went here for a multiple birthday dinner, we made reservations for 8 and more people showed up. The servers were so helpful - moved us to the pope room (which was a bit creepy, oh well) and gave us a constant upkeep on drinks. Food was pretty good, service was spot on. Too much food though, I should think, but it IS an Italian style family dinner. 4 stars for awesome service."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, the bartender was very busy but had s terrible attitude & not into customer service.  He was irritated that we wanted to try a couple of wines prior to purchasing a bottle. The co-workers were good to each other but not into the customers. Even the manager brought food out but let it sit rather than figure out who should get it. We spent $100 for two people and we won't go back. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Our Sunday funday consisted on trying something new in our area. And we ended up at Buca di Beppo. It was wonderful. They had asked my boyfriend and I if we had ever been in before and we said it was our first time, so they gave us a little tour. The entrance to the dining area is through their kitchen which I thought was super cool. The gentlemen in the kitchen were all super nice and respectful and welcomed us in. Our server was awesome!!! This place is great. We had their spicy chicken rigatoni and their cheese bread, both delicious!! 
We will definitely be back again!!"}

{"text":"Ever since Planet Hollywood purchased Buca and changed the recipes, this place has started to suck just a little. I USED to love this joint. Now, I just like it. The prices have gone up about 20% from just a couple of years ago. NO MATTER WHAT, do NOT go to any Buca without a $10 OFF coupon. The Entertainment Books are flooded with them and they are easy to get a hold of online. Smack in the face with your $10 coupon and enjoy a good, NOT GREAT dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very good food.  Not the BEST Italian food I've ever had but definitely worth the trip and good quality overall."}
{"text":"Happy hour here from 9pm - 12am.  Exactly what I needed after getting my ass handed to me by that two deck blackjack dealer.  Sausage rolls and some other type of good Italian appitizer.  Good service too.  Got a table in the bar area looking outside toward the girls coming (so to speak) and going from the Thunder From Down Under show.  Watching girls walk in high heels for the first time in a year with a slinky top is a BLAST!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend last night. First time. In my limited experience for restaurants, this is the best Italian food I've ever had. We ordered a apple gorgonzola salad with walnuts and raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Best salad I've ever had. For an appetizer we had calamari that my friend wanted. I've only had it a couple of times at other restaurants and never was impressed. Now I'm impressed. The texture was different than the thin dried crunchy calamari I've had before. Loved the marinara sauce. Had a slight kick to it. Then we had the lasagna. Loved the taste, I don't know if it was the sauce or cheese but it had a taste I've never had in lasagna before. My favorite lasagna ever so far. Our waiter was upbeat and returned numerous times to check on us. Lots of families eating there. I knew it was going to be good when I had to circle parking lot looking for a place to park. Finished the meal off with chocolate cake. Just found out there is another location in east mesa close to home. I hope its as good as the Scottsdale location. Thought it was going to be overpriced until I saw the small portions were for 2 people and the large was for 4. Generous portions. I don't know how anyone single can eat there though as I didn't notice anything smaller for 1 person."}
{"text":"Really good food but service was not at all good! We waited so long, our waiter was not a people person, didn't tell us about portion sizes, and the place was pretty dirty. (Can't imagine how the kitchen looks)"}
{"text":"The food was good the service was outstanding!
Our server was named Victoria and she was super nice. Went out of her way to make sure we were well taken care of. 
I would go back again.
Good family place with plenty of food.

{"text":"Came here with my family this past week.  Besides the annoying people at Excalibur trying to constantly sell something the overall experience was great.  The food was super yummy and priced very affordably. If you go to the Buca Di Beppo website they will send you an offer for a free small spaghetti, alfredo or baked ziti.  We opted for the baked ziti which was delicious. My husband ordered a pepperoni pizza which he enjoyed.  We had more than enough food for us and our two children. It is not fine dining but for a family in Vegas or a large group it is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Delicious italian restaurant located in a nice area in Las Vegas. Not too far from the strip. I went there 3 times in August 2008. I ordered alfredo fetuccini with shrimp, margarita pizza, salad bread (garlic bread with tomatoe salad on top and cut in 4 squared pieces). I suggest you to order the smallest size (personal) since I the portions are huge!!"}
{"text":"Janine is awesome!!!! We are still on our adventure of finding a new home after the sale of our home and went here for something to take back to the hotel for dinner. Wow!! AMAZING service from this woman and honestly everyone in the place!!! We were immediately greeted at the door and escorted to the bar to place our order. Janine was VERY helpful and friendly!! She was also kind enough to listen to our story and then prepare a bag of plates, utensils for dinner AND our left overs as well as offer us courtesy drinks (soda and water) while we waited for our dinner! Janine is a bartender there however, she clearly takes pride in where she works and if I didn't know her position, I would have thought she was the owner!!! I will DEFINITELY be going back here for the amazing food AND exceptional service!!! Thanks Janine for making dinner this evening a simple process!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here with my family many times and have never had such a bad experience. We decided to call in an order to go so we could enjoy our meal at home since it was my birthday. First off, when I went to pick up to food(we ordered chicken saltimboca, ravioli with meat sauce, and a meatball), the girl at the counter asked if I needed any cheese or peppers. Of course I wanted parmigiana. I asked her if she put it in the bag and she said yes. I got home, and there was one packet of parmigiana...one...for my whole family to use. There was no plastic ware, napkins, or anything else in the bag. We open up the food and start to serve and found one of the bread loaves sent had mold growing on it(picture attached). I had thought they baked the bread there, but apparently, they just warm it there. Many of the ravioli were adhered together and the meat sauce must not have been stirred well because the first bite I took was full of pepper. The chicken was cooked well, but their quality control is lacking because on piece had a heavy handed amount of sage and was inedible. The meatball was good however. I called the restaurant to inform them, but was placed on hold for over 5 minutes, and I didn't want to wait in the phone during my birthday party. I'm disappointed in the quality of the service and the food received, and I'm not sure if I'll be eating there again."}
{"text":"The only reason my husband and I took our kids to dinner, was because I purchased a groupon. Well....never again will we step foot in this restaurant. Immediately, sitting in our booth the cushions were so worn out, I thought I needed a booster seat! They need replaced!!! My husband and son who are the seafood eaters in the family, got the sampler appetizer. Which they did enjoy. My daughter and I split the white pizza, which was recommended by our server....very disappointing. I think Little Caesars pizza is better and cheaper. The boys got the linguini and clams, nothing great. 
We were all so disappointed, it was an expensive outing. Especially  since parking isn't free. Live and learn!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here tonight with my family. Andie, our server, was amazing. She was honestly one of the best servers I've ever encountered in the restaurant industry. Her attention to detail, friendly attitude and genuine smile that never left her face made for a very comfortable/memorable dining experience... Also, the food was on point and the hostesses at the host stand were very friendly and hard at work. I noticed them bussing/setting-up tables, delivering waters and engaging with the guests. 5 Stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Restaurante maravilhoso! Excelente comida e cervejas geladas. Excelente ambiente e atendimento! E o melhor, ótimo curso x benefício! O melhor de todos!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. It is an absolutely horrible place to go if you are by yourself. Food is served family style, so take your sorry single self to a different establishment"}
{"text":"I've been to several different locations and have never been disappointed. While the wait at another restaurant was about an hour, I spotted this place across the parking lot and immediately smiled. I love this place. 

This location gave a quick little tour of the kitchen. I've never been to a location that did that. It was cool and smelled oh so good. 

We had a pretty cool waiter. He had a sense of humor which is a plus for me. And of course, the food was amazing. Even tried something different and fell in love with it. Everyone left with full bellies."}
{"text":"Been to the ones in San Jose and San Francisco. This one was delish as well. The $10 24oz drink with $7 refills rocked."}
{"text":"If the idea of awkwardly taking a tour of the kitchen followed by a maze through overrated Italian singers only to be led to a picnic table of the worst food ever... You are in for a good time.  DISGUSTING! Worst Italian food ever! They shouldn't even call it Italian food. It tastes like a frozen lean cuisine. The bread was even bad. Overpriced! Don't waste your time and money going here. 

This place really should receive a total of negative stars but yelp wouldn't let us post.   Sad"}
{"text":"Here early for a party and been sitting at the bar for 20 minutes  and no one has even acknowledged us."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I was very nervous to eat here but I had family in town and we decided to give it a try. It took them about 5 minutes to realize we had walked in. The entrance is a little secluded so maybe they need a louder Bell for the host to hear. This was a very family oriented Italian restaurant. 

Food Experience:
The food comes in large portions so order to share!!! These prices seem expensive until you see the portion size. (Keep that in mind) The fold was delicious as well. We got a large supremo pizza, chicken parmesan, and baked ziti. All which were amazing and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day. 

Service Experience:
I can't remember our waiters name buy he was tall and slender.  But he was fabulous!!! Very attentive and nice. He came back several times to make sure we were satisfied with our food and experience. 

Overall we were very happy with our experience here and can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill in the last few years. Stopped in tonight 1/17 and was told over a hour wait. So we waited and waited and waited some more.  Then we finally got seated and waited some more! Then l finally got up and asked for a server. When she came to the table she was very pissy. She didn't refill the drinks and the food took FOREVER!!! We won't be back and it's a shame because this placr used to be awesome!"}
{"text":"For the price and portion.. I was expecting better.
Yes, it's family style.. They went on and on about it, the portion was decent, but I wouldn't say it was that big. I've seen a fair amount of places with portions that big for less than that price. Granted I'm from Wisconsin and I went there on an empty stomach, I was going all out. So yeah, Buca calls it family style, I call it one hungry Wisconsinite portion with 1/3 to take home. 
Anyway, noodles are quite inexpensive so the dish better taste pretty damn good to be worth the price, and to me.. It was lacking. That extra money is basically going to the atmosphere and experience. ( which my friend said that the Buca on Flamingo is much cozier)
My friend and I ordered 2 appetizers ( with a coupon through Buca's website) We had the antipasto salad, and  mozzarella garlic bread. I enjoyed the salad, and the bread was decent, but it took at least 20-25 minutes for it to come out. The waiter wasn't the greatest either, and he looked busy, but I really felt like we were put on the back burner compared to his other tables. People that were seated after us were receiving their appetizers before we did, one family even had their pizza come out while we STIll waited for our appetizers! 
I ordered the ravioli al pomodoro, and trust me, it wasn't worth 25 dollars. To me it tasted quite basic, and the sauce tasted like it came out of a Ragu jar. I have to say that my friend enjoyed the sauce, but it looked watered down and tasted pretty basic.
My friend ordered the penne arrabbiata, that was okay, I liked it more than what I ordered, but still nothing to write home about.
When the bill came out, the waiter had forgotten that we had mentioned earlier that we had a coupon, we had showed it to him earlier but he needed to see it again for the code, but because it was through my friends phone, it only allowed him to open it once and it couldn't be used again. Our waiter said, \"sorry\" but there was nothing he could do. I think he really didn't care, and was sick of dealing with us, he wanted us out of there ASAP. He had mentioned earlier that today was his last night before his vacation so... Hmm. I understand that the coupon issue wasn't the waiters fault, but I've worked at restaurants before where you try your best to please the customer, he made no attempt to offer up the manager or try to help. It wasn't like we were lying since we showed the coupon to him earlier.
I know it's a chain, and I really noticed it in the food, perhaps I'm picky, but I prefer a smaller, non-chain, authentic Italian restaurant, where you might get a slightly smaller portion size, but the food is cooked with thought and doesn't taste like it came out of a bag, jar, or can.
Needless to say.. Not going back there again."}
{"text":"Pasta and salads very good, maybe not \"real\" Italian fare, but I like it.  The apple gorgonzola salad is very, very good, and I get it every time I eat here.  I wish this place would do two things:  clean their carpets more often and replace the carpeting on the steps, and lower the volume on the piped in music."}
{"text":"Thank you for wonderful service by your staff Jarrett and trainee Frances . 

The food came out quickly and as always enough to feed a large family

Refills came quickly with our water and soda

Celebrated my husbands birthday with a song and dessert"}
{"text":"Environment: I went here on a lunch date with my boyfriend and we were literally the only ones in the restaurant, which wasn't bad but different. It was quiet and dimly lit and the walls were covered with some pretty beat photographs.... overall the environment was cozy.

Service: our waitress was great,  she was up beat and very attentive ( we were the only ones there so how could she not be?). Like all good servers she gave us our space but made sure all of our dining needs were met

Food: awesome! The  bruschetta was out of this world. I ate do much of it that I could only eat a bite of my rigatoni 

I would come back"}
{"text":"My husband and went here tonight and I have to say, this was the most amazing dining experience I have had in a very long time! Our server Hailey (same name but not me hahaha!!) was absolutly wonderful! She was so genuine and sweet! She was having a rough night because of another table and she never let that get in the way of our service! My drink never went lower than half gone before she had another drink at our table. She is so amazing!  I also had the pleasure of meeting her manager, Mike. You can tell he really cares about his staff and has complete control over his resturant. I had to call him over to gush about Hailey and you could tell he was very proud. I will forever go to Buca! The food was amazing and the staff is outstanding!!!!!! If I could give a rating higher than 5 stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our meal here. The service was very slow and the food was absolutely tasteless and overpriced. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"sat. aug. 20. 2016-worst italian meal i have ever had! this used to be our favorite and has taken a nose dive, BIG TIME! come on, the marinara/pasta side dish was so over cooked, it could have passed for soup! absolutely no taste! pasta so over cooked, it was as thick as a #2 pencil??? REALLY, THIS IS ITALIAN??? cold bread??? 49 minute wait from salad until a simple pasta dish is unacceptable. both dishes were cold, tasteless and late, had to beg for extra bread. since when does an anti pasta salad, not cheap, have little to no meat?? maybe four olives and one was spoiled and pretty much set the stage for a horrendous evening of dinning. our cute little 16 year old waitress must NOT understand an ice tea refill should come with a fresh lemon. i got warm tea with my old smashed lemon on the bottom of warm glass. really, at $2.95 for a tea, no fresh lemon? $22 for a small spicy chicken rigatoni, looked like it was dropped in kitchen, all the noodles were busted, over cooked and dried out! chicken was like jerky, gawd!! hard to believe, save your time and money, this place is worthless for dinning!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful environment!!!! So much to look @, food comes in hearty portions, friendly service. Totally enjoyed my visit & dinner."}
{"text":"I visited here before and it was really good. Not so much this time. The place was empty yet the kitchen couldn't get spaghetti and meatballs right. It came out very watery and I sent it back. When it came back, it was still watery. I gave up. Not sure I'll be coming back here. Dissapointed."}
{"text":"You come here for the family meals and will be full after you leave.  We had the mussels in the white wine sauce, spaghetti and meatballs and the pesto stuffed chicken.  We ate it all and enjoyed it.  No big surprise with the dishes."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Buca Di Beppo and unfortunatley will most likely be our last.  We decided to try it on the recomendation of my wifes co workers.  Usually if we eat Italian out we go to Carrabbas but we are always looking for new places.  It started out ok we were greeted right away and seated quickly, it was early though so there werent many people there yet.  The waiter was new and couldnt find the kids menus right away but no big deal it is family style dining so just order big plates of stuff and share.  Well it quickly went down hill from there.  They brought out cold stale bread to dip in olive oil and balsamic.  We ordered the chopped anti pasta salad which wasnt bad but we ordered no onions and clearly they didnt realize until they had already put some in there and then tried to pull them out but missed a few.  For the Main Course we ordered Chicken marsala that was overcooked slabs of chicken breast that almost tasted microwaved which was covered in an overly sweet pre made tasting sauce (I have had alot of marsala before and never did it taste like this) my son thought it was orange chicken, lol.  Along with the chicken we ordered the famed garlic mashed potatoes which reminded me of my childhood and the PASTE I used to eat in 1st grade!!!  The worst mashed potatoes I have ever eaten.  They were obviously way over mixed.  You could literaly spackle a wall with them and the flavor was not good either.  Oh yeah did I mention the waiter smelled like an ash tray.  This was not waht I expected at all and I will not be returning the price tag for the pain was $80.00 which normally isnt bad if the food is descent.  Maybe it was just a bad night but there are too many other good places in town to try this one again."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain and a bit pricey, but with the family style food, there is plenty of leftovers.  We ordered two dishes thinking we would not have a lot of leftovers, but we were wrong.  We loved the different salads.  In additional we ordered a combo platter.  It lasted us for three days, so the price per serving came down quite a bit.  Service was good despite the two huge parties that were there.  This is a good place for groups."}
{"text":"Hubby had never been to a Buca, so we figured why not? Of course we went during I'm guessing prom night...which on a side note when did prom start to look like a bunch of strippers running around? Wow. Anyway it was really busy, but no huge wait time. Seated promptly and began to look over the menu. 
Our server was amazing and very quick with everything, and had excellent communication and was really friendly and prompt even with the onslaught of teens next to us. 
Anyway, someone accidentally picked up our order sho we had to wait a moment more which was perfectly fine in my opinion. Food was good, but we both felt it could use a little more sauce. Ordered a cocktail, which was good, boozy, and of course came with a souvenir glass. I don't live that idea, cuz I really don't even want a souvenir glass from an actual destination place, but oh well. At the end when our bill came, they had taken of the entire entree because we had to wait so long. I was stunned. I really want even upset about the wait, however I.appreciate it because it makes me want to be a repeat customer. So thank you for providing customer service and we shall return!"}
{"text":"Hmm. Well our last buca experience wasn't bad, but this one was pretty disappointing. Unfortunately we were hoteling it for Christmas and there aren't many food options for Christmas day. I booked a 530 reservation for 5. We were seated after 6:30. I realize it was crazy busy, but at least have a way shoo people can sit in their cars while they wait. Adobe there is no waiting area with seats and it was freezing outside. I also realize that you don't want to rush people to get out, but you have been in business awhile and probably shouldn't run it like the airport. Overbooking just ruins everyone's experience. 

Once we were finally, and somewhat rudely seated, I was appalled. In our area was two large tables and two small tables with dirty dishes just sitting on them. So here you have people waiting but you have open tables everywhere. The second bad part was that those tables were never cleaned up while we were there. Kinda unappealing. 

Our server was nice enough, but wasn't up to par flit a mediocre restaurant. It took over twenty minutes for our basic drinks, bread was forgotten several times and we had to ask several times. Ordering our food was well over 30 minutes into our seat time. 

When food finally did come the kids pizza was a sad excuse for pizza. Soggy and super greasy. The gnocchi was way overcooked and virtually has no texture beyond mush. Alfredo was an empty flavor palette. The only good part of the food was the chicken saltimbocca. That was delicious. Refills were illusive. Service was MIA. 

Again, I realize it was a crazy busy holiday, bit i still expect a restaurant to perform. You still need to provide a service and be friendly. The food overall was fine, and did the job, bit I was not happy with the experience. I'm not one of those people who rudely complain or treat servers/hostess/hosts anyone. I wasn't whining and making a stink about standing and holding a sleeping 7 year old in super packed entryway for over an hour...The least you can do is your best."}
{"text":"YUCK
Meatballs were like rocks
No Mas
Never had a good meal at any of their kid friendly birthday places"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of about 15 friends. They put us in the Pope Room, so we had the pope in the middle of the table to entertain us. 

We were pretty loud (mostly me), but our waiter was super awesome in working with us and recommending stuff. He was super nice and took great care of us. 

Service was a little slow, which is understandable with a group of our size. 

Here's what I shared with three other people:

Artichoke Florentine Dip- super yummy with crunchy little bread slices, plenty for 4
Baked Ziti (Large)- loved the ricotta, PLENTY for 4, enough for 5 regular people without monster-appetites 

Turns out to be pretty affordable if you come in a group and you don't mind all eating the same thing.

I also had a few drinks, so don't judge me. Be happy I can offer so much review! 

Also, the drink menu isn't online (except for the wine, which doesn't help me), so the names are what I can remember, which isn't correlated with the fact that I had about 4 drinks...

Cheap Red (just ask for their cheap red), 9 oz.- good about for 2-3 people to share
Blended (something) Margarita- pretty delicious
Red Sangria- sweet and yummy! Comes with an orange slice and cherry

Overall, great for groups, or a first date. :]"}
{"text":"Jarrett was great! We had a large group that kind of dwindled away but he was the best guy!"}
{"text":"Visited on Friday, August 4th. They were having some power issues and we asked repeatedly if they would still be able to serve food. They assured us that the power would be coming back on shortly. They seated us. And never came back. We did see one waitress going back and forth several times to another table, but no one brought us silverware or asked us what we wanted to drink. After waiting for 7 minutes, timed on my watch, we got up and walked out, RIGHT PAST THE GIRL THAT SEATED US. Not even a word from her! On the way out to our car we did see several servers in the parking lot on their phones, smoking, chilling, etc."}
{"text":"Loved the tour! This place was really nice with 2 levels full of Italian artwork covering the walls made the atmosphere warm, fun, and inviting.  Like your grandmother's living room! Everything about the restaurant is \"large.\" Huge portion sizes made it perfect for sharing and separate private rooms made it cozy for large families enjoying a night out. Our service was awesome as it was my friend's birthday they brought an oversized birthday card signed by the staff and gave her a special happy birthday song rendition. I enjoyed the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and the Cheesy Bread Florentine, while the others had Baked Rigatoni; there were no complaints and plenty in our to-go boxes!"}
{"text":"I agree with Walter, old school style Italian.  Had I known this, I would be visiting the location in my home town of San Diego.  Reminds me of the wonderful old school Italian reataurants in Newport Beach and Anaheim (near Disneyland) that our family frequented as children. Food was excellent and better than what I was expecting."}
{"text":"This is great for family style dinners.  If you want some extra fun reserve the table in the kitchen.  Come hungry and in a big group so you can order a few dishes to eat and share.  This is great for large groups and parties."}
{"text":"The wait is fairly long. If you're bringing a group, which you should be, make a reservation, even though you'll probably still be waiting a bit. Do bring a large group because the food is served family style, and if you're a small group or only two you'll end up paying a lot and getting a lot, and taking a lot home."}
{"text":"Service was only ok.  The food was not.  Wanted a break from the casino,  didn't want fast food,  but that would have been better. At least at fast food restaurants you expect to be treated rudely.  Pasta was bland, skimpy on the sauce and salad came with the hot food.  Overall,  yuck."}
{"text":"I do NOT even want to give this restaurant one star. This restaurant should be closed!!! I bought a groupon last month and went in to use it for a take out order. While I waited in the bar area off of the lobby, I noticed that there were these plug in floral air fresheners. It smelled horrible all around me. Apparently they are attempting to mask the dirty smell that was coming from the carpeted floor and walls around me. Next, I thought that I saw a mouse!! I was not sure so I stood up and went into the well lit Lobby. It smelled in that area also. I decided to go upstairs to the ladies room. The entire way up the disgusting odor was all around. I passed the kitchen area into the filthy bathroom. I didn't use it, I turned around and returned to the Lobby. I paid for my order, gathered it and left. I am not going to say what I did with the food.  Do NOT eat here. 

ATTENTION STATION SQUARE..... YOU NEED QUALITY RESTAURANTS IN AN AREA THAT MANY TOURISTS VISIT!! This city has an amazing culinary reputation! I can't believe this place is open!"}
{"text":"Short story:  We wanted a fun night with the kid and take her somewhere besides the local Mexican food joint we always drag her to, but instead waited forever for adult food and left without getting our main dish because it took so long.  At least the kid got to eat dinner since her's arrive 20 minutes before we lost our patience waiting for ours.  Left to a pissed off server slammed plates and telling her manager how horrible we were while we were walking out because we had the audacity to ask to have the pasta removed.  $60 for a kids meal, some iceberg and romaine lettuce with Italian dressing, three drinks, and service with a \"smile\".  Glad to see customer service at it's finest.  Would be a one star had I not been there previously and last night might have been a isolated incident.

The long story: I've been to Buca numerous times previously and had really good memories.  Heck, I asked to be taken there for my 18th birthday when I was a kid.  Since it has been a few years, we thought it would be a fun place to take the kiddo since she had never been.

We made reservations but it really seemed like we didn't need them on a Friday night as a table of 5 was sat behind us about 10 minutes later.  The hostess was pleasant and gave us the kitchen tour.  It took quite some time for our server to arrive since she actually met our kid first while she was on a mission for the bathroom.  She asked for our drink orders and the second I asked about wine she said, \"think about it and I'll be right back\".  Bring backs some waters and a sprite.  She comes back for a food order and my wine order.  When the wine arrives, I discover it's an $18 glass of vinegar and she admitted she told the bartender she thought it was bad.  So, new bottle opened and the wine was actually really good, but now we are 30 minutes into the meal.  Salad arrives and then about 5 minutes after that does the cold bread and our kid's meal.  So my husband and I wait.  And wait.  The slowest eater on the face of the earth is now down with ALL of her kid's meal and our dinner hasn't arrived.  Mind you, the table behind us as previously mentioned had already polished off their salad and pastas.  We are done.  We put out the credit card on the end of the table, she sees it, and runs back to check on our food.  SURPRISE!  She arrives with the food.  And we tell her to box it up since it took so long and we are done.  Boxes up the food and blames everyone else.  Brings the bill WITH the food on it that we didn't even want anymore.  Husband asks for it to be removed and says to just leave the food on the table.  She gets pissed; she slams plates at the table behind us.  At this point, I stop defending her and it's all on her service.  Throws the new bill on the table and makes a sarcastic comment about the pasta being gone.  We pay and tip her and her attitude accordingly, leaving the pasta on the table. As we are leaving, we see her complaining to the manager about us, but he sure didn't seem to care to check in.  At no point were we rude until those last 5 minutes.  We were polite about the wine, didn't complain about not getting more water, didn't mention that the salad was mediocre, so it's definitely not surprising that the pasta was the deal breaker.

Next time we will make the drive to a different area and spend the same amount of money for unique food and better service."}
{"text":"I just left from here, and now back to work!

I had a lunch entree called Lemon-Chicken Saltimboca.  This was a meal choice favorite of the hostess.  When I'm a newbie, I usually ask staff which entree they like.........and I order it.

The waitress was pleasant and friendly.  My food came within an good amount of time considering I informed her I only had an hour lunch.  

To start, I ordered a coffee x2, and I do have to say that the coffee was bold and served my mellow demeanor well.  I am perky as I need to be for work.

My first bite of the Chicken was an absolute wonderful surprise!  I never 
had such a satisfied palet.  It was chicken breast topped with a few articoke pieces, peas, and a lemon sage sauce.  Fettuccine Alfredo served on the side.  Great contrast!   Soft bread was served with an oil and vinegar mix for dipping......WOW, I really liked that.  

So everything was just about perfect........I wanted my water without ice, but it came with ice.......oh well......I'm still A-OK 

Next time I go I will order the Collossall brownie sundae to share with my family."}
{"text":"The service is beyond slow despite it not being busy. Salad and bread are extra! If you don't like to eat garlic DO NOT order the garlic bread. It has a bunch of small chunks of garlic....so you are pretty much eating garlic with bread. The food was ok. In comparison to Olive Garden I would say it's about the same."}
{"text":"So far I have been here a handful of times to this location.. not as busy as San Diego but still good.. the portions are large which I Love.. it's all good here and I love Italian food so I am happy to know there is a Bucca here in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Nothing homemade about this place/sauce is about as mild/non flavored as you can get...Save your money, go elsewhere...we ordered 4 dishes for a party of 12/with 2 bowls of salad/some soda drinks $250.00 with tip....which was about $20 of ingredients in the meal. Noodles overcooked/actually mushy. You can tell everything is out of a can/jar."}
{"text":"We went there as one of our only options for a deal while vacationing. I received great service. The food was really good and we all had a fabulous time. The serving are on the huge side but it's so good that you want the left overs."}
{"text":"The food is great. The service was so slow.  The food came out in a timely manner then after that our server disappeared.  We had to get up and ask someone else for our bill.  It took 20 mins for the server to come over, then he said OH you want boxes to go? We said yes and our bill.... Then Nothing.... we waited 10 mins and asked another server to please help us.... he said I will get your server, we waited  20 mins.... a manager came over to 4 tables in our area but didn't stop at ours, I even tried to get his attention. We waited another 15 mins then walked to the entrances and told the hostess we wanted to pay and leave.  Guess what?? We had to wait!!! OMG! finally, the manager came over we explained the situation he had to go find our server to get our bill so we could pay our bill and leave. UGGGGG we were there for 2 hours!!! 45 mins was waiting for food and eating the rest was waiting for our server."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday had too walk up out my seat too get my beer personally from the bar. The chicken marsala is not even really Italian style its sweet chicken with syrup . The complimentary bread was not even warm my pasta was served cold and everything was overpriced. No coupons were honored and the waitress was very busy and did not give us very good service and had a bit of an attitude. Very disappointed in the lake mead summerlin Buca first and last time I will go there especially on my birthday not cool. We waited forever just to get a box too go we were there for almost 2 hours for a simple small order and a kids menu item major set back for my day."}
{"text":"I ordered food Saturday night from Grubhub.  Waited 1 hour and 40 minutes to get cold food.  I called Mark, (Manager).  He told me he was off on Sunday, but would follow up with me on Monday.  That didn't happen.  He didn't even care until I told him I was going to put up negative reviews.  Anyway, I finally received a refund.  After spending over an hour on the phone with grub hub.  Glad I received cold food, and a refund.  I will never go back to this locations."}
{"text":"From time to time, it is inevitable. No one can ever be spared the experience of going to a chain restaurant, and quite frankly, sometimes there are hidden surprises out there. I'd like to go on record by saying this Buca di Beppo is one of them.

Immediately upon entering, I felt as though I'd been transported into a movie set. There were hundreds of pictures on the walls, each depicting some famous or wannabe famous person. There were wonderful pictures of the beautiful, stunning Sophia Loren that surely ignited scandal in the fifties. There were knick-knacks, tchotchkies, statues and signs everywhere, and it felt surprisingly uncluttered, like a grandmother's living room, each picture a memory long since forgotten but easily reminded.

And then there were the people -- To get to the dining room in the basement, you need to go through the kitchen, then down two flights of stairs. Every single person who saw our party walk through the kitchen said hello. And not in the way as to seem as if that it was something they had to say off a script. The cooks, the dishwasher, the cashier each said hello in different ways. We were greeted at the bottom of the stairs by a few servers in a warm and welcoming manner and I had never seen anything like it.

The manager was funny as well, joking with a patron who said he was full by replying \"Good. We don't want you to walk to the car, we want you to do dishes and work it off so you're hungry again.\" Not a forced, rehearsed line -- something genuine from his own humor. I love to see that sort of interaction between people, especially when it catches one off guard.

I know what you might be thinking: Peter S., what about the food? Well, look: If you have an italian family, this may not be Grandma Willhemina's gravy and bread, but it's damn good. The meatballs were easily as big as my head (and my head is large in it's own right!) and the pasta was dressed perfectly -- there was just enough sauce for the noodles to be coated without dripping all over the plate, just enough to sop up with a piece of bread or three or four. The Chicken Parmesian was exquisite, the chicken cutlet tender and covered with baked mozzarella to form another kind of crust on the existing crust. The Lasagna? Oh, boy. The Alfredo? Oh, please. The Caprese? My belly's going to burst.

My biggest surprise was the pizza. My son and I have an agreement when we go somewhere, where we both split our meals. I get a piece of what he's eating, he gets some of mine. His pepperoni pizza was fantastic, the crust thin and stone baked, the sauce sweet and garlicky. And when I asked him how his meatballs and spaghetti were, he just gave and thumbs up and devoured it.

The best part of the meal came at the end, when we were sitting around chatting. The dining room was empty aside from our party, and I could feel the ambiance all over me. Frank was singing, and there was laughter in another room. I couldn't help but feel as though this was 1958, and the boys yukking it up in the other room were Dino, Sammy, Frank, Joey and Peter, instead of just a family from Bay Village.

Make no mistake, People of Yelp, and People Who Take Words of Strangers To Help Form an Opinion: This isn't four stars for a chain. This is a legitimate four stars, mostly for the people and a good bit for the food as well. This Buca di Beppo is one of the better places to grab some italian fare on the West Side of Cleveland. If you've got to suffer through a chain, don't. Go here and feel like you're part of the family."}
{"text":"If you are ordering drinks through this Yelp (Eat24), just know that this location doesn't have lids for their drinks. The literally pour it in a clear solo cup and expect you to take it that way. We ordered two apple juices and one Pepsi. Couldn't have my kids trying to hold their drinks with no lids back to the hotel room. So I asked the bartender if he had saran wrap. And thank goodness he did! He was nice enough to help me out with that. 
Food was just ok. Definitely costs more on the strip than if you're eating away from the strip. 
Probably not ordering take out from this location again. We only did it cuz we didn't want to leave the Excalibur hotel."}
{"text":"Take out order today (mid afternoon)...chicken parm and create your own pasta.  Chicken parm was good!  First time trying CYOP.  I thought the CYOP would be a light and fresh tasting dish but the chicken was over cooked a lot and the entire dish was pretty dry. 

The woman answering the phone and taking orders was cordial but clearly not thrilled to be working.  

This is our fourth time trying this location (1 dine in/3 carry out) in 1.5 years.  We started doing take out after the initial and sad dine in experience.  

We had a decent reward club coupon which drew us in (again) today.  Almost $50 for two small dishes without coupons.  We won't pay full price for this service and food.  The chicken parm never disappoints but it can't continue carrying the entire experience."}
{"text":"My expectations were high because I chose them for my post wedding dinner in Vegas Buca did not make the grade not even close! I've eaten at other bucas and the food wasn't this bad. I was dealing with the events coordinator that was very friendly she assured me that everything that would be set up prior to our arrival and it was but not everything was. The space they gave us was a tight fit for the 34 ppl we had. The attendants were slow to fufilling requests. It took a while to get to the main course. The food was ok some of the pasta didn't have any flavor. I would never never ever go there again. They left a bad taste in my mouth for life!"}
{"text":"If you want great Italian food and a place where you can actually talk with your family and spend time with them I've great food you can share this is the place for you.  Great food, great staff and it feels as if I'm at my grandmas house for a home made meal.  This is a great place for a big group or family.  I'm from Los Angeles originally and this location is the same as it is in Pasadena.  I had such a good experience, when I go back home I'm going to go to the Pasadena location!"}
{"text":"Saturday night.... We were seated right away. The manager found Game 3 of the Stanley Cup... The customer service was superb (thank you, Damen!) and the food.... Phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible experience. This was by far the worst restaurant experience we have had in Vegas. My boyfriend and I decided to try and eat there for lunch since we are staying at the Excalibur. That was a MISTAKE. The waitress kept touching my boyfriend and I let it go because I didn't want to make a scene. It progressively got worse and he made a comment about how uncomfortable he was and how badly he just wanted to leave. Our food came and that's when it got worse. I for the fettuccini alfredo and it was sitting so long it started to get a thick film over the top of it. So gross. Look, it could have been a man, woman, alien, I don't care. It's about respect. Wether in a relationship or not. You shouldn't be touching customers. I wish I could have enjoyed the meal. But even if the experience and service was better. The food was not up to par. UPDATE currently have the worst stomach ache"}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere! Great food. But a $140 dinner for 2 I expect more. Birthday celebration & dessert isn't free? Fine. But at least make the cheesecake as the menu states. Service was sub par at best. Made my decision easy to never go back again."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with friends and had a great time.  Josh was excellent.  Food was great and there was a lot of it.  There were a lot of Bdays that night and it added to the energy of the restaurant.  Exactly what I would expect from a strip location."}
{"text":"Warm decor and friendly service!

Our waiter was not kidding when he said the portions were big! There were four grown adults in our party and we could not finish the fettuccine pasta and pepperoni pizza we ordered.

Only gripe was that the pizza was extremely oily."}
{"text":"Buca's not the best Italian food you'll ever have.  It's not the best Italian food you can get in Vegas.  But, my friend Daniella is from a very Italian family and they come here all the time so it can't be that big.

If you've never been here, the first thing to note is that everything is served family style.  As such, I've found it's much more enjoyable to go with a BIG group of people so you get a varied choice of a bunch of different things.  I went last night with one friend and we got the gnocchi and chicken marsala.  And, while the gnocchi was good, you can really only have a small portion before feeling like a dumpling yourself.  The marsala is different - it's much sweeter than what I'm used to, but still very good and is served with big, plump mushrooms.

Their salad with prosciutto and gorgonzola is fantastic, and we ordered a $10 tiramisu wondering what a $10 tiramisu looks like.  Well, we found out.  It came in a giant bowl and 3/4 of it is still in my fridge.

No, you can't have any.  It's all mine."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Took almost an hour to get our meal and it was a step above a hungry man frozen dinner."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend nobody go this restaurant because they are racist employees. I wouldn't do delivery for them. Please do not take your black friend to this restaurant because your black friend will feel uncomfortable to eat at this restaurant. Please do not order food from Ubereats app at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! 
We eat here every single time we visit without fail. 
I've eaten at other locations in other cities and they weren't as good as the vegas locations are. 
My favorite thing is the Mozzarella garlic bread! Order the large because your family will devour it! 
Also, ask for a side of the pesto cream sauce and you'll thank me later :)
Always friendly service. 
Tip: served family style so the portions are usually 3 pieces for the small and 5 for the large."}
{"text":"So, I will say that I have only been to one other Buca di Beppo and man let me tell you... two totally different experiences! This experience in Old Town was terrible! From the hostess to the MOD, just bad.  Ordered an appetizer, it was luke warm at best...the main dish was good and so was the side. The server in the bar had all the tables and it was just him. Not filling up water, taking them and maybe returning them with the correct glass (straw...ewe!) to the correct table.  Yuck

There are much better Italian options in Old Town ---Olive Garden is right down the street."}
{"text":"If your primary objective is to have a relaxing place to go with friends or the kids and the food does not matter very much the Buca Di Beppo is the place for you.  The food is OK but that it about it.  When you get past the quantity you realize that the food is pretty bland. It is the Olive Garden of family style Italian.  A chain that does family style right, although it is a bit more pricey, is Maggiano's Little Italy.  There you can get loud, enjoy your friends, but have much better quality food."}
{"text":"Amazing pasta! Anything with the rosa sauce is great, plus spend an extra dollar for mozzarella on your garlic bread. So good :)"}
{"text":"I don't care that this place is in the Excalibur and you have to find your way through the smoke filled casino to get there, once you're inside you have no idea what is going on outside the red walls of this place.  Food is always consistent, good and hot!  Huge portions made for sharing - and be careful ordering anything LARGE there, they mean it.  On a business trip so could not take home the left over pasta, too bad it was good.  Service was good, never waited for anything.  I'm glad I finally found people to go with to this place, it's no a place one person could eat alone without exploding!  Love it for the great food and service!  Wish it wasn't inside the Excalibur but it's fun to see the old place every so often."}
{"text":"We have always been big Bucca fans!  We have frequented Chicago and Minnesota locations.  This is our first time at this Bucca.  Food was excellent as always.  We are big fans of the Mixed Green salad with the prosciutto and Gorgonzola!  Also love the baked ziti and chicken saltimboca.  Our server Jarrett was great!  Friendly and helpful and knew how to handle a table with little kids!  This was my birthday dinner this year and it was great a choice!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight! Our food was delicious, hot, and saucy. Our server, Stacy, was quick, charming, and provided an excellent customer service experience! My first time here and I really got an impression of a well organized strong staff, will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"They get a 4 because they were out of tiramisu and we ordered a chicken meal we didn't get. They didn't try and charge us for it though. We did have a large party and our poor waiter was busting his butt with the bar and s huge are to work. The food was good I wouldn't get the stuffed chicken again because I couldn't taste the cheese I wanted more cheese for sure"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fun visit with a big group of friends recently. Service was EXCELLENT and food was perfect size for all of us to share.  The food was delicious....not necessarily authentic, but it was served hot, fresh, and tasted great. I would definitely go back to this location again in the future."}
{"text":"For years I have been wanting to eat at Buca di Beppo and it just never happened.....until now, when in Vegas!  We ordered a Bruschetta (I must admit I am a Bruschetta snob).  The bread it was ordered on was done just like I like - crunchy on the outside and sofft in the middle.  The bruschetta I felt lacked Balsamic Vinegar which our waitress was kind enough to provide us with a lovely balsamic glaze that we drizzled on top - PERFECT.  The meal selection was Linguine Frutti di Mare.  My only complaint here was that I did not have enough room in my stomach to finish; which was probably due to the fact that I ate most of the bruschetta (did I mention how much I LOVE bruschetta?) and that we asked for a meatball \"just to see how they were\" and the one she brought out was HUGE!  The wine selection could use some improving, but that wont stop me from visiting another BUCA."}
{"text":"Reasonably good food. Terrible service. Took half an hour for the salad, then another half hour between the salad and entree. The server offered me a box for the salad when she brought the entree, didn't give us fresh plates between courses, and didn't refill water until I asked. Bringing the check was the only thing they did efficiently."}
{"text":"It was my first time At This location and the server was decent but kept rushing us to finish. She would check on us and run off without letting us finish answering if we needed refills or anything else. Midway through our food my entire party of four saw a waiter sneak a finger into someone's drink refill while he thought no one was working. If I ever go back I'll make sure he isn't my waiter and if he is I'll ask for a change. I regret not saying anything at the time."}
{"text":"The food was good, but very overpriced for what you get.  We were the only people in the restaurant at noon. Our server was great, but overall we were underwhelmed."}
{"text":"A small error on the meal ended adding an additional 45 minutes to our meal! Being ignored is NOT the way to care for your guest when YOU make an error on the order."}
{"text":"Average, average, average.  It's not bad, but there simply is no \"wow\" factor that you want when you go to a restaurant.  The family style forces two people to agree on what they want any given night, and I don't like being boxed in.  Food is good, but nothing really what I would call above average.  Service is friendly and very good, but can't really overcome the middle of the line everything here.  Sorry; wish it was more exciting."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Buca Di Beppo and had a wonderful experience leading up to my actual encounter with them. 
I made reservations with them a week before and admit that their attitude over the phone was great! They were always pleasant and very helpful. 
Fast forward to the actual day: The two waitresses we had weren't terrible but I felt very rushed towards the end. It was my son and daughter birthday's combined. A couple things that bothered me was, apparently the drinks aren't free refills, which isn't a big deal, but it would have been nice to be informed before I purchased (3) of them. Towards the end, before we were even done with our dinner, the cake was brought out (which I didn't even ask for bc we weren't done with our dinner) and before we were even done with our cake they started cleaning up (this was at 8:30) and they don't close until 10 (11, I believe). 
I really enjoy Buca but I'm not sure I'd go back to this location."}
{"text":"This was a fun and delicious dinner to celebrate a birthday.  We had stuffed shells, spaghetti and meatballs, delicious green beans, and a pasta with different kinds of seafood.  Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked.  We also had calamari to start and it was very good."}
{"text":"Very sad I didn't get my buca di beppo CHERRY POPPED !!!! they sat us in the fucking dungeon and didn't take us around the restaurant On fucking New Year's Eve.. and we made a reservation2 1/2  months in advance...We were sat in the boring dungeon I would've had more fun in the play area at McDonald's very disappointed..... The manager Michael Nichols said our specialty is catering to large groups well excuse me my fucking money is just as good as theirs everybody that goes there should have a good experience not just large groups so fuck Michael Nichols we will not be back"}
{"text":"Happy hour all day sounds great, but its for specific cocktails and beer as most places. The food is great and the portions are quite generous as it is served family style. Make sure you go during dinner hours so you'll feel you've gotten your money's worth. We dined in the bar area twice and both times the service was horrible. I'm not sure if it was the set up or if our servers just lacked experience, but I asked myself several times if anyone was even working that day. 
Overall, it wouldn't be the worst experience ever if you aren't focused on service."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo is my favorite restaurant. I love going here. I love the food and I especially love the atmosphere. Unfortunately the reason I have to give just 4 stars is because the service is totally hit or miss. I've gone with large parties and had excellent service. I've gone with small parties and had lousy service. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. All the same, it is a must-try if you're in the Phoenix area. Someday I really want to eat in the pope room!"}
{"text":"Food was good service was good, but this was second time we went and they don't have lasagna?"}
{"text":"I was going to pass on reviewing this place, but I left behind a \"You've been Yelped\" card and didn't want to be proven to be a liar...

My parents were in town and it was my brother's birthday.  The only Buca in Omaha had closed so they wanted to come here while they were in town.  It started soon after we sat down with a kid screaming bloody murder at a booth beside us.  Maybe the parents would take him outside to calm him down?  No such luck.

We ordered a few items, with my parents ordering a salad in which a special cheese was a key ingredient.  After halfway through the salad we realize some thing is off.  There is no cheese.  So we bring this to our waiter's attention and he goes to the kitchen and comes back saying they ran out of that cheese.  So.........instead of informing us of that they just throw out an incomplete salad and hoped we wouldn't notice?  

The rest of the food was ok, when we thought we tell them it was my brother's b-day to get the piece of cake and b-day gift certificate deal, they were, you guessed it, out of cake.  So they substituted a piece of cheesecake.  

For that and for taking the salad off the bill, I can give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Over priced and not family size portions like stated! The bread was hard and dry and I can't believe they are still in business...."}
{"text":"This place is complete chaos. Nobody seems to know what's going on. It took over an hour for our food to come. The service was awful."}
{"text":"Great as always, great server, he was handling at least 20 tables and took care of me well. Ian was his name. Food was amazing, love eating at this restaurant when I get a chance because I love big portions and take home."}
{"text":"Tried Buca di Beppo for the first and last time tonight.Went with my brother we got stuffed shells .The stuffed shell may have been the worst I have ever eaten.My brothers home made ones are much better.We also got Mozzarella Garlic bread which was disgusting and two Italian Sodas which were good.It was 38.00 for a food which didn't include salad or bread.I'll never go there again.Piece of advice for Italian chained Restaurants go to The Olive Garden more choices,cheaper prices,better food and you can get bread and salad with your meal.I will give Buca di Beppo credit on one thing it was cool looking ambiance"}
{"text":"I got a $20 off coupon with a purchase of $40. So I decided to give this place another try. Last time the food was better but not great. This time the food was really poor quality. I ordered a $15.99 Caesar Salad, first off if someone pays that much money for a salad the bowl should be full it was 2/3 full, not a big bowl. Another thing the lettuce was horrible wilted and black around the edges, gross. The employee who prepared the salad through in the end, gee thanks. 

We ordered the Fettuccine supremo it tasted flat. Not much flavor in the sauce. They used shaved chicken and not much of it. Not even a whole breast of chicken. Six pieces of broccoli. The noodles were of poor quality. We ordered the small it was $23.99.

We also ordered the garlic bread. It was the best part of the meal. It was made on cheap not fresh white bread. Horrible for 10 bucks. 

I'm done with this place! To many other good places to eat in Chandler, that use good quality ingredients for less money."}
{"text":"I must admit that I haven't been here since my senior prom. I was craving garlic bread and made the trip over from Phoenix. Hot fresh and yummy. Husband had the lasagna which was great too. Our server was very prompt and the manager Mark checked in after our meal to ensure we were happy. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food. However, 5 USD for one meatball is a little bold!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience especially our server Jewell. The food was perfect as was the entire experience."}
{"text":"Good place for family gathering.  We had a birthday celebration there.  Both service and food were good."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Buca by my Investment Banker. He told me he takes his family there all the time and they love it! So I guess he was calling me family by taking me there. The portions were huge and the food was amazing! By the end of the engagement, we had made a deal pertaining to a new Investment portfolio- so I suppose you could say he won me over! I can't count how many times I've been back to this place. I love it every time!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Arrived on Sunday when they first opened. I'm sure they served me yesterday's leftovers. No flavor. Fun atmosphere, but I won't be back"}
{"text":"Confession: I have NEVER cooked a turkey and I don't want to. Too freakin' big and it's too much work. I already make Thanksgiving breakfast so I have a pass when it comes to the turkey. So, Buca it is and they have never failed me. They always work with my request on substituting the sides for more mashed potatoes which is a big factor why I order our dinner here every year. I also called Thanksgiving morning to change my order from half pans to full and that wasn't a problem. Found out last minute that we'd have more guest than expected. 

Out of all the restaurants that we've tried in the past for our turkey, this has been the most liked by our family and this year so did our guests. We like white gravy on our turkey instead of brown so I just use the gravy from the country fried steak I made for breakfast. 

We are not crazy for stuffing but we like Buca's. Thanksgiving just wouldn't be complete without it anymore. I think I'll make a reservation to eat there next year. 

We got 4 boxes of pumpkin pies with our feast. I gave 2 boxes of them to my brother to take home since his kids liked it so much. By Friday morning, mine was all gone!

The bread was sooo soft and creamy. It was all gone when I woke up Friday morning. I was looking forward to having some with butter :-/

Mashed potatoes basically is loved in this household as much as we love rice. So yes, overall nothing was wasted. 

It's pricey... but there were 15 of us and we had it for breakfast and lunch too for Friday :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a friend's birthday celebration. The service was a bit slow, especially as the restaurant was not that busy. Our waiter was not knowledgable in their allergy menu. Nonetheless, my gluten free friend found an item to suit her. I would think allergens and the specialized menu would be a part of training?

Otherwise, the food was delicious. I ordered the penne al forno and it was super good! Pasta was not over cooked and there was plenty of meat in the dish. 

Their wine list is also extensive. Definitely an upgrade from that other Italian chain."}
{"text":"I had one of the best waiters in the world.  One of those guys who always speaks about 10 decibels too loud but who will do whatever it takes to ensure you are a satisfied customer.  When I told him that I'm vegan, he went to the kitchen to ensure that the ingredients in the meal I wanted were all vegan (which they were).  I ordered the veggie pizza (without cheese).  It was thin-crust and absolutely delicious.  He asked me if I wanted balsamic vinegar and some olive oil on the side.  I said yes, and he put some in a little plate for me.  The bread was great, the pizza was great, and the waiter was great.

My family loved their food as well.

The bathrooms have some of the weirdest art up on the walls of butts and elephants doing suggestive things and fat people and naked Greek statues and every weird, crude, amusing thing you can think of.

If I go back to the Burgh I'll be back to Buca di Beppo."}
{"text":"We frequent on occasion. The food just just okay. Not bad, but not great. Certainly filling though. We do enjoy the salads. Service is a hit or miss. We have had some great servers, and other times they were literally horrible. However, it is a fun place to eat with friends and family if you get decent service."}
{"text":"I was happy with the food, except the bread.  They were slow to bring it out explaining that the entrée came up sooner than expected as if there was something to the bread preparation.  The bread was sliced and put in a basket - very cold almost as if it was in a refrigerator.  No salad was offered as part of the meal.  The price was pretty good compared to other restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I love it. I was skeptical at first because of the reviews but I'm glad I came in. I suggest try it yourself and don't base it of of the reviews about $$. If you go and order 2 dinners your paying anywhere from 10 up on a plate. It's the same here except it's one huge plate. The Penne Basilica I got was huge. It states feeds 2 or more and now I have plenty to take home and eat later. I loved the little tour we got while being taken to our seats that was pretty cool! Also ask for Alyssa she was our waitress and was super nice and friendly. What are you waiting for STOP reading this and get down there!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there. The quality of pizza and ither services are average. The waitress was so rude and impolite. One homeless guy suddenly grabbed the first piece of pizza!!! So wired... 
Do not recommended to anyone"}
{"text":"It cracks me up to see people whining about the portion sizes being large. This is a *family-style* Italian restaurant. Their dishes are meant to be shared among everyone at the table! The food is delicious. I have never been disappointed. My fiance and I came here last on our anniversary in March. My only complaint is that the desserts were a bit overpriced. But the food is good and the decor is lovely too."}
{"text":"Man I really enjoy coming here, but the last two times I've been here the service has gotten worse and worse. Last time we waited 20m just for someone to come and take our drink order. Asked to see the MOD several times and no one promptly showed up. At the end of dinner the MOD came by didn't comp anything off our bill and just made poor excuses for the staffs lack of professionalism and speed. I haven't been back lately. I do enjoy the baked rigatoni with a side meatball. My mom always orders the alfredo. Portions are meant to be shared but we don't, we just take them home to have leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"I seat on the bar because I was in a rush and the bartender Igor and Nicole take care of me, I only can say that they give me an amazing trade in my hole dinner delicious food the pizza was amazing the wine really tasty it's a colorful place, I recommend seat on the bar the attention it's great...I'm gonna be back"}
{"text":"I recently visited this location attending a business mixer event. WOW these portions are HUGE. They have small and large sizes - I hope you are really hungry when you come here. 
I really enjoyed the interior - old nostalgic photos, italian music in the background and the family style of service. I wanna say that I felt like I was at home sharing my meal with family - after all when you are dining with me - you WILL be sharing your food. =0)
The restaurant is separated by different areas but still open concept so its great for group events - there was a birthday party going on in the next area too."}
{"text":"11/03/2017: UPDATE
I have added a star to my previous review. As soon as I emailed corporate about my experience in detail, I was contacted immediately by the divisional Vice President who apologized sincerely and directly dealt with management and staff at the location. A more favorable outcome was offered and in return I wanted to update my review. The situation was now handled correctly by management which I sincerely appreciate since I have many years in the service industry as well. It's basic customer service.

10/30/2017:
Visited tonight for my girlfriends birthday dinner and brought friends and her mom that I flew in from L.A just for dinner. Thought this location had the best reviews of all the locations in the valley.

Absolutely terrible management. Our group was originally large so we confirmed the Popes Room. Upon arrival the group number shrunk but we were still told we would have the room. The host told us otherwise and she checked with the manager. She never told us we did not have the room but we were led to a regular table. Bad communication and bad management! 

Our waiter took a good 5-10 minutes to first visit the table and tell us he would be with us shortly. Another 10 goes by and he stopped to take drink orders which took another 10 just for waters and soda. Another 5 for the sangria. He rarely stopped by except to finally drop off food.

He dropped off the check and told us he would get boxes for the leftovers and never returned. I pulled the manager over and told him all of the disappointments. He gave us a \"discount\" maybe taking a little tax off.

DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION. WE ALL COMMENTED HOW SHITTY THE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE WAS AND TIPPED AS SUCH.

Disappointing experience and even more disappointing birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Food was good but super over priced. Made a reservation for my daughters birthday - rushed us even though they weren't busy - specifically told them it was my daughters birthday yet brought the check when I wasn't at the table and gave the bill to my daughter. When I brought this to attention of hostess - told oh ya! you were here for a birthday then turned away, blew me off and started to seat a group that just walked in."}
{"text":"Jarrett, our server, rocks!  He made our dinner more fun.  Look for Jarrett the next time you come to Bucca!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Buca in a hot minute, being two Pizza Bagels from NY - Italian & part Jewish for those playing the home game - we tend to be picky about such things, especially me. Scott was given $50 in gift cards, and we just had lunch to-go. 

This is white people Italian food. L'Madigans will dig, and that is ok. Scott had the veal and wasn't impressed, especially for $28.99. The meatball was ok, and sausage & peppers side was AOK, too. Years ago I remembering thinking portions were huge: this did not feel like $50 worth of food to me, especially without pasta. 

Serviceable \"Italian\" for the Olive Garden crowd...they have a Pope Room which is fun for a group. Meh.

TL/dr: if you say \"matz-a-rella\" and think Olive Garden is Italian food, you will puffy heart this.

* This is really a 2.5* review now, both of us had agita all night from the food * 


** the woman who took our order, cashed us out, and packed up our meals was on point, she brought my rating up **

*** Agita. I'm repeating it, because their food will repeat on you :/ ***"}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service. You will never leave hungry. The atmosphere is friendly and the people make you feel comfortable and relaxed."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday as we have for several years. Reserved a table in the kitchen they had a mix up with the reservations and had to change it to two hours earlier.  No worries as they comped is free appetizers. The service was slow and low to par heard servers swear in the kitchen twice. We didn't get offered refills on our waters or drinks. Had to tell the server it was my birthday and no singing as they had done in years past with the calenabra. It was a disappointing night of celebration."}
{"text":"I think this location has management issues.  The whole experience tonight gave the strange feeling the restaurant is on the verge of closing down.  The interior seemed dirty- especially the men's bathroom.  The air in the whole restaurant had a slight \"wet mop\" odor.  We were greeted at the door by three employees who didn't seem like they knew what they were doing.  We had a line of sight to three empty tables but yet one said \"hold on I have to go see if we have a table\".  5 minutes later he came back and seated us.  

The prices are outrageous for very average food- and that's putting it on a curve. 14 bucks for a margarita?  The spaghetti with meat sauce was cold and watery.  The meatballs are extra-16 dollars for 3 of them- and I could have done better making them myself.  I went to cut one in half- didn't take much pressure with a knife until the meatball literally fell apart in pieces.  Caesar salad was made by one of those packets you can get at the supermarket.  Server was nice but we never saw much of her."}
{"text":"I love this family style restaurant the service is outstanding a server regularly waits on me her name is Bailey she is an outstanding server always has a big smile on her face and is so nice like all the other servers the food is plentiful and outstanding & I have so many good memories coming here sometimes w/ my family & friends and myself thanks so much for all your warm hearty good Italian food w/ great hospitality I always recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Dustin Moore took great care of us, checking on our table often and making sure everything was correct and tasted great. Our server Dionte was amazing as well very attentive and polite and made sure our water never made hit the bottom. The food was amazing and the family style makes for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Looked and saw this place is open on Thanksgiving. Nothing about recommending a reservation was stated. Host was very rude to anyone that was a walk in. Lack of training on the system. I just feel bad for the people that actually wait over the time she gave them and asked  about it."}
{"text":"Come as at least a small group as everything is served shareably sized family style-the small chicken dishes contain three large breasts each. Small basket of garlic bread is at least 18 inches of an italian bread loaf cut in pieces and prepared.  Whimsical nostalgia decor of family pictures and memorabilia provides entertainment. The food is good standard Italian with attentive service."}
{"text":"Staying again at Four Points. Dinner was so much tastier than last year. Dawn our server was delightful and good. She (and others) dealt with a party of about 30 while we were there and she didn't miss a beat at our table. Try the Malbec, very smooth."}
{"text":"I like Bucca,.  We come here sometimes with just the kids and split a pizza and order of green beans and it's always fast, good and the kids enjoy the place.
Sometimes we come with a large group, and that's always fun too.  Reservations are good for large groups, of course."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves \"Italian\" food to those who have never been to Italy. The food is mediocre at best, the quantity is overwhelming (designed with huge families of overweight people in mind) and espresso tastes like instant coffee. The decor is done in incredibly poor taste even for a \"family\" restaurant. Definitely avoid."}
{"text":"For me, this is a chain that really does a good job delivering a mass-produced experience. 

What is most amazing to me is how fresh and tasty the tomatoes and tomato sauce are for a chain the couple of times I've gone to a Buca. It makes even simple dishes like eggplant parmesan really good.

I've also had fine experiences with the wine and tiramasu they have that can make a family or friendly gathering at a suburban chain a good time. Or you can just go with a date and start a bottle of wine and sneak the rest into to the Harkins theatre thats right by there.

The comfy booths and attentive service has always helped as well. This location also features a seemingly long lost Wilson brother waiter. You'd swear working at a suburban Phoenix Buca was part of Owen's rehab program. He's got some pretty good indie movie recommendations too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and im sad to say its going downhill. The service is always good, but the food hasn't been. I used to absolutley love the baked ziti but the past two times I've came its been tasteless. I visited today only because of a coupon i recieved in the mail. Not only were the noodles not good, our bread was burnt. We asked for more bread and it was burnt also. 
The thing I dont like the most is that the bathroom is located in the kitchen. This is not ideal for the elderly. You have to go up two flights of steps to get there."}
{"text":"This place has really decent food for a chain, and is very nicely decorated. Its fun to look at the funny pictures and figurines- you never know what will be next to the table where you'll end up sitting. It's really more for families or groups than for couples. Portions are huge, the cocktails I've had were good, the dessert I tried was only ok."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever!! Waited for about an hour just for our appetizer and after an hour and 15 minutes we left because our food was still 15 minutes out. There was a ceiling leak at a nearby table and their sanitation score was 90. Avoid if possible!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow.  Asked for manager, he said he would check on our meal.  It took over an hour and he never returned to our table.  Server and manager hid in kitchen.  Server offered us a dessert for the long wait, but I asked them to take a dish off the check instead.  Server disappeared with our check and she took forever to return to our table.  Went to look for manager again, but he was hiding in the kitchen.  Same thing happened to us two years ago, but I thought I would give them another try.   I will never return and I'm writing to their corporate office.  Also, everyone around was sat after us, got served and also left before we were even finished with our meal.  Extremely horrible service."}
{"text":"I should have known this dinner would not be a good from the moment the waiter came to the table he looked like he just crawled out of bed, his name was Michael, then he spilled a glass full of ice water on a woman at the table next to us.  Let me do something different for this review because there were so many things wrong:
*The food was terrible
*The food too long to arrive at the table
*The meatball order did not arrive until the end of the meal
*The pizza dough was sour and my kids just ate the cheese
I will never ever go back to Buca for any type of meal."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Italian restaurant. Their servings are huge and the food is always tasty! I've been to this location many times and I've never had a bad experience. The price is worth it. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time back to a Buca di Beppo since we left Chicago in 2002.  A zany place where every room is a collage and story.  Photos adorn all the walls, even in the bathrooms.  And the themes are irreverent, like The Pope room, tastefully done, but, zany.

We took our 8 & 11 year old grandchildren here and I was surprised that they \"didn't get it.\"  They did not get the humor of the rooms and themes, so I guess that comes with more maturity.

Food is Italian and they have a pretty good menu.   But beware that the dishes are served FAMILY STYLE, which means that the food comes in portions that will accommodate 4 or more people.  It gets tough when you have two fussy grandchildren who each want something different, especially when we grandparents want something else.

You can end up with an awful lot of food.

Fortunately, they have a kid menu, so we went with the kid cheese pizza and lemonade.  Whew!  Wife and I did the calamari and penne al forno.  The squid was rings and tentacles and done very nicely.  We asked for more marinara sauce which was freely given.  Used the sauce also for the penne.  And the penne was flavorful with that marinara.

Having traveled in Italy, we very much like the Sicilian wines and others from the Puglia area on the heel of the boot.  Buca does have a number of such wines and they were just great with our meals.

Kids were non-plussed, but it mattered not to us.  We just enjoyed the zaniness and good service.  An A-OK experience."}
{"text":"The food is good , place is so nice and clean !! But service is horrible, is terrible!!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for anyone else, and I won't. Tonight was my first time at Buca and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and my experience. I recommend sitting in the kitchen and enjoying the deluxe treatment. I will be back for more of those baseball sized meatballs."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for my teenaged daughter and her friends for her birthday. Called earlier in the week and made reservations. I had to call the day of and move them 30 minutes, they were very accommodating and change it. 
I had only been here once before in SLC, so I asked our server what we would be best. She made some wonderful suggestions. We were a party of 9, we ordered a small antipasti salad, a large margarita pizza and spicy chicken rigatoni. 
   Our drinks came out in a timely manner, followed by the salad which could have fed everyone. They then brought the pizza and pasta at the same time. All the food was delicious, and service was great! 
For dessert we order a chocolate brownie sundae which easily fed all of us, I believe we ended up leaving some. 
  Our server was absolutely awesome, I believe her name was Ashley. 
  My only complaint is halfway through our meal, they were cleaning up the floor in the section behind us, and it was annoying hearing the broom and dustpan for about 10 minutes behind me. Also wondering how much dust was being stirred up around my food. With all the decorations, its a bit dusty."}
{"text":"Coming all the way from San Antonio Tx. This place was awesome. Great food, friendly staff. I'm hoping to come back."}
{"text":"This will be brief.

The service was good, she checked on us. And was very helpful. 

The food, I could have done without. Pasta is bland, very lil flavor. It all around sucked sad to say I was hoping for better. Seems like the cook had his hand slip with the red peppers because I had to stop eating, it was way to spicy. Not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at this restaurant chain, because who doesn't like \"family-style\" portions (Plan on going hungry).  We also like that they have some Vegetarian selections on the menu.

This particular location is inside the Excalibur casino, which requires the usual tempting and distracting walk through their casino to get to - Well worth it tough. We decided to try out this location, because we were walking back from the Luxor to buy show tickets, which turned out to be a \"bust\", and we were tired and hungry - So we needed some Buca di Beppo lovin to make us feel better.

We dined early at this location, so we did not wait long for a table (probably about 10 minutes at the most). While waiting, we decided to have a glass of wine at the bar, with our server providing an excellent suggestion from the wine list. Once seated, our server provided some good Vegetarian selections from the menu, so we went with the vegetable lasagna and the house salad. The food and service here was as good as expected for this brand.

BTW - If you are not in the mood for meat, and want some really hot and yummy, they their Eggplant Parmesan. It's the best we have ever had."}
{"text":"How could you not love Buca's? So many fond memories in the Pope room. Great lasagna, chicken Marsala and salads. I love the atmosphere too, how could you not love it?"}
{"text":"Good solid lunch experience. Rigatoni, chicken carbonara and cannelloni.  All three of us were happy. Good service."}
{"text":"Severely disappointed in this place. We went with a large group, which I understand can be difficult, I've worked in restaurants, I get that. We arrived a little late, everyone was getting salads when we got there, but I don't find that as an excuse to serve us a good 15 minutes later than everyone else. When every other person in the room gets a water, drink refill, boxes and dessert before we do, that is just bad service. I alone spent $15 on wine, another $30 on the food and yet received awful service. The waiter brought us our check before we were offered boxes or dessert, and everyone else was practically on their way out the door because they had already paid. When a large group comes in that you are literally making thousands of dollars off of, don't you think you'd get better service?
The worst part of it was when we asked the waiter for the manager. He left, did not come back for about 15 minutes, and when he did come back, he brought us our checks and said there was nothing they could do. We then again asked for boxes, dessert and a manager. When the manager came out, he was EXTREMELY rude and basically told us \"too bad\" because we were with a big group and we came in \"late\" (let me remind you, people were just getting salads on the table when we got there, that's not THAT late) so it was our fault. He eventually comped us a meal, but he was so rude about it that it didn't matter. I was shocked, I have worked in restaurants and been in a lot of restaurants and I have never encountered a manager that was that horrible. I don't think we were asking for too much, just the same service the rest of the group received. I obviously won't be back and won't recommend this place to anyone, ever. They don't deserve the money I gave them in the first place. If I hadn't been with friends who had reserved the party, I wouldn't have paid them. THAT'S how bad the manager and the service was."}
{"text":"signed up for email and they gave me a coupon for a small spaghetti, baked ziti or fettuccine Alfredo.  We chose the spaghetti and added meatballs.  Yhe meatballs were as big as my fist and the whole dish was fresh and delicious! It served myself and my husband until we were both stuffed and still had enough left over to feed 1-2  more people!  I absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We came here one evening expecting a high end experience, and sadly we were disappointed. 
Cons:
1. The tables and booths are so close together !! I could hear everyone's conversations around us. 

2. We ordered the family style lasagna (for 4 people) and let's just say it was really a one person serving. Not only was it a small portion, but it was expensive !

Pros:
Friendly service"}
{"text":"Eh, Alfredo is better at Olive Garden and spaghetti was bland BUT calamari and stuffed mushrooms are amazing! Love they take you to your seat through the kitchen. I'd recommend appetizers and Italian soda :) servers are great, friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of dinning during an engagement party, but the bar tender was still attentive and fast with my service. I'm under the impression that if I was to come during normal dining that I would have a wonderful experience. The staff was really busy, so there was a lot of traffic. Over all I had a good experience. The food was good as well."}
{"text":"Service is always excellent, food is always fresh me and my family love coming here on holidays and special occasions!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, significantly better than Olive Garden, but not how ma fixed it by any means. Still, if you're craving Italian and in Vegas, it's pretty good. Also they have great sangrias! The waiter with the beard who just had a new baby was awesome. Super attentive and very friendly."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Buca. We always over order too, but enjoy the left overs. Food is great. Good lasagne and Chicken Parmesan. Great atmosphere for family meals."}
{"text":"My visits here only include group dinners and orders from their to-go menu. My experience with the staff has always been pretty good, but the food is only okay.

What makes eating here so worthwhile is the $10 off $20 coupons that they always seem to have around, both online, via e-mail, etc. I had three of them in my Entertainment Coupon Book.

I like their fried calamari because they not only include the rings, but also the full body of squid... *crunch, crunch* Their linguine frutti de mare is quite tasty if you are a fan of seafood. I have not had this elsewhere to compare, but I like it, especially the part where I get to open up the clams. 

I have also had the stuffed shells. A picture of these might cause you to start drooling; that is what got me! Unfortunately, I was not fond of them. They are quite spicy (which I was unaware of when I was ordering, that was my bad), but they did not taste good in general and you do not get very many shells.

They do banquet catering and off-site catering. They even have a wedding brochure. 

I only go here when I have a coupon, but for italian food --- I would still prefer Olive Garden. Unfortunately, they are always more packed than this place."}
{"text":"Josh C. was the best! We had such a great time at this restaurant. Super thankful for Josh's wine suggestion- it was amazing. Thank you Josh! Great food. Even better service. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"4/15/17. Still a great experience. I love everything about this place.



I give up. I added a star based on their ravioli and their salad with apples and gorgonzola. So their you have it. Finally a four star rating after many years of sampling."}

{"text":"On a visit to Las Vegas, we wanted Italian food and decided to try this location since it was on the strip. At arrival, we were greeted right away. Our waiter explained to us that their dishes comes out in big family size portion. There were 6 of us and we ordered baked ziti, chicken alredo, prosciutto stuffed chicken in the smaller 2-3 portion size. All 3 dishes were very tasteful and we also had left over to take with us. Will definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last week and it was awful. Do Not waste your money. The lobby smelled like sewage. We ordered garlic bread, rigatoni, and chicken Marsala. The chicken was very dry and Barely edible. We waited for 30 minutes with a 2 and 4 year old and no bread; not even the garlic bread we ordered. No waitress either. We ended up getting our entire meal for free because it was so bad and the wait for the food was so long. It was a gloomy Saturday afternoon and very dead."}
{"text":"After having a horrible experience at the Station Square location the VP of Bucca called to offer me a $75 gift card to give them another chance.  I switched locations to the Robinson location and it was much better! The food was a lot better but the service was great! We had Brian (dark hair) and he did an amazing job! We were there with 3 children and he was very good with all of them. He was very attentive and any time we needed anything he was right there to ask. We had the chicken  parm, caprese salad, spicy sausage Bolognese, stuffed shells, and the penne ala vodka.  Everything was very good, but the vodka sauce was especially delicious! I think this location make up for everything that was horrible about the Station Square location. Thank you again for the gift card!"}
{"text":"It's Buca Di Beppo.  Its not great its not bad.  What else can you say about the place?  The place is great for groups but food is just so so.  Disappointed that not even a small happy bday dessert given to a 11 year old birthday girl after they sing happy birthday."}
{"text":"We always love coming here, the food and service are great!  I just wish you could order single portion dishes as well.  It makes it difficult for our family of four to dine here more often."}
{"text":"Ate here 3 times during my stay. Food? Pretty good. The service on the 1 night I ate in the actual restaurant was just ok though. I will give them the benefit of the doubt because I'm pretty sure he was also bartending and waiting tables."}
{"text":"My one complaint with my visit was I didn't get any bread.  It seems to be happening a lot lately, where I go to a restaurant that offers free bread, and I am overlooked.  Oh well.

At this location, the first thing the hostess will ask you is \"stairs or elevator?\".  At first I was confused, until I realized that the restaurant is on the second floor.  We took the stairs.  Next time, I will take the elevator and push all the buttons, although I imagine there are only 2 buttons, one for each floor.

If you are new to family style dining, it can be a bit hard to understand that the menu prices seem high, but each platter serves a lot of people.  The \"small\", which states it serves 2-3, is actually enough for 6 meals.  I mean, you'd have to be a huge eater to think a small only serves 2.  I've never ordered a large platter, but I imagine enough food to feed an army.  Anyway, a small platter runs $20-$30.  More than enough food for a family of 4, especially if you get the free bread and order an appetizer.  If you look at it that way, it's a bargain.  Everyone in your party just has to agree on what to order.

For $45, we got the spicy pizza and the chicken carbonara.  The pizza was delicious.  The chicken carbonara was delicious.  Food took roughly 20 minutes to arrive.  That's a good thing... it does take time to cook meals.  

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  

One suggestion.  Just give me my bread."}
{"text":"Their dinner portions are meant to be shared among others. Prices vary from 30-40$ and can be split to about 3-5 portions. Lunch special ends at 3PM. I'd recommend coming for lunch specials if you are eating by yourself. Those prices vary from 13$-18$ depending on the entree. I got the spicy chicken rigatoni. 13.49$. Wasn't too spicy but if you can't handle spicy then i would just either make it not spicy or pick another entree. Rigatoni was cooked nicely but the serving size of the chicken was under my expectations. Chicken was also soft too, as it seems like the chicken was cooked with the sauce on a simmer. I personally like chicken when it's pan fried to give it a crispier texture but it wasn't bad. 
TL;DR: Would recommend but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Come for lunch specials if you're solo.

Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"Celebrated my son's graduation at Bucca. Loved our server \"DaJon\" . He was very helpful and tried to warn us about the portions and amount of food we were ordering. We should have listened! Food was great and all 8 of us had plenty of leftovers. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Updating my review: Thank you to the Jeremey Coleman, Divisional VP for assisting me with this issue. He called me on a Sunday afternoon asking what had happened. I appreciate him making a call on a Sunday to clarify the issue. He was prompt and professional about the issue. He complimented us with a gift card for us to return at a later time. We thank you him for taking his time on a weekend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Wish they had larger drinking glasses for the sangria. The sangria was good.  The portions are huge. The apple gorgonzola salad is delicious. We had cheesy bread, salad, stuffed chicken breast and seafood linguine. Loved everything. Got a gift card at Costco. $74.99 for a $100 gift card. That's my kind of deal. The place was clean and the staff is friendly. They weren't crowded we went during the week."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Our 3rd time this week. A fun place to eat. Great place for families and groups. Kid friendly. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I couldn't WAIT to take my boyfriend here!  I used to meet my friends at the Buca in Mayfield Heights eons ago.  Although I'm sad that there's only one Buca left in our area (Strongsville) I was thrilled with our experience! 

 The hostess took us on the legendary tour of all the rooms and the kitchen (on our way to our table) which is a must-see for new diners!  She pointed out our chefs and the illustrious \"chef's tables\" that can be reserved by patrons that want an \"up close and personal\" experience inside the kitchen.  

Every room has a theme and we were seated in the back corner of the Cardinal's Room complete with red and gold touches.  There is also the Pope room (featuring a glass enclosed Pope bust in the center of the huge round table), the wine room with over 400 bottles of wine on the ceiling, the Poster Room with a vintage inspired arched ceiling, and several other kitschy rooms.  The Mayfield Heights location had a \"Frank Sinatra\" room which is sadly not showcased at the Strongsville location.

We ordered the Caprese Salad and the baked Ziti with Garlic Mashed Potatoes, the Penne Arrabiata with spicy Italian sausage, and (seriously?) the Tiramsu.  We were in heaven!

Friendliness prevails at this restaurant - from the hostess to our server Lindy to the other diners in our room!  a VERY friendly, homey, romantic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I don't believe they care in their sauce I believe they just let the place go right down the hill it's a shame because I used to like it"}
{"text":"Spaghetti Western is a great authentic Italian family restaurant. It is family owned and operated from Italian's. 

The penne aribiatta and tiraimisu is awesome.  Order it everytime!!"}
{"text":"Buca is a great place to get a lot of food that you can share.  The food is tasty and can be a good place to go when you want something a little more than Oreganos or Olive Garden.  I would recommend this place for big families or parties that like family style food!"}
{"text":"Dinner was great! The house wine is delicious. Jarette really helped us through the menu and was a pleasure to be around. Very much enjoyed our dinner this evening."}
{"text":"Very mediocre.  Too expensive for the quality of the food and service.  Our food wasn't cold when it came out, it wasn't hot...more luke warm.  The salad was wilted with way too much dressing and the dessert tasted almost freezer burnt? The service was sooooo slow.  I took a group of people there for a celebratory dinner and I can say with 100% certainly I will not choose this place again. Oh, and the waitress spilled water on my husbands lap.  Good times.

UPDATE: Someone from Buca replied here to give them my email address supposedly in an effort to make it right.  Guess what's they never contacted me back!  About par for the course I guess.  Taking my rating down from 2 to 1.  Now I think they are fake.  They pretend they care.  They probably just asked me to give off the perception to other people reading reviews that they have the heart to make things right for the customer.  Not the case.

UPDATE Jan2015: Emily Bishop the Division Vice President emailed me saying she wanted to \"restore my faith in Buca\"  I promptly responded with an email about what happened... Guess what?.... NO RESPONSE BACK!  (It's now been over a month) Wow is all I have to say...."}
{"text":"I wanted to take a moment to tell whoever is in charge of a situation I experienced. Three weeks ago, my husband and I had a very bad experience. The waiter was not attentive, our food was cold, and when asking for a manager, he never got us one. However, he claimed he did. The story is too long, but because of a wonderful assistant general manager, she took the time to make everything right for our following visit. Honestly, I hadn't planned on returning.Our recent visit from July 13, 2017 was extraordinary. The two key people that changed our opinion of Buca di Beppo was   Vicki Banusevich and Fallon Natolitani.  We had impeccable service as well as wonderful food.Thank you for having a caring staff. This experience could have had a different ending."}
{"text":"It was my birthday!! So birthday lunch here it was. OMG so there is this amazing Mozzarella Garlic bread you have to get as an appetizer!! It's mouth watering.The portions are served a la carte, therefore portions are family style. The Chicken Parmesan was delicious and more than enough. I tried the Peony which is similar to a sex on the beach. For 13.99 you get to keep the glass as a souvenir   awesome isn't it? Yes! The waiter was kind, attentive and friendly. I was surprised with the colossal brownie as the team sung happy birthday and blew out a candelabra. AMAZING!! I LOVE THIS PLACE! 
(Only downfall were two screaming kids)"}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant didn't even order any food was to disgusted after using their restroom."}
{"text":"Got there at 6:30 and were seated right away. Waitress came by 10 minutes later smelling of smoke for our drink order.  We ordered four beers and 6 waters. 20minutes later our drinks came with bread along with the cloud of smoke following out waitress. We were already starving and didn't care that the bread was cold!! Not even hot as the waitress stated it was fresh out of the oven! 10 minutes later she came back for our orders.  Food came 50 minutes after being seated. As there was one large party and a few other tables. A glass of water was spilled and after sitting there for 10 minutes using the place settings and napkins we had to soak up some of it we flagged down the bus boy for help. Only one time during our dinner did the waitress come by. 
Then we needed boxes, 10 minutes later she came back. Then it was the same with the check. I wish we didn't even tip her. She was in no rush, no concern for her tables and zero personality.
That is the third time in three years we have been there and I remembered why we never go there..... THE LACK OF SERVICE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a company dinner and let me tell you to come here HUNGRY because you get tons of food. We had a 5 course family meal and it was ok. The service was good and the food was good compared to the prices. In other words it was cheap so the food tasted cheap but I was so hungry I really didn't care!
They also have happy hour all day which is nice!!"}
{"text":"Great service, fast and fun. Makes you feel at home. Manager Josh was awesome, Michelle's super cool. Thank you making giving us a great experience."}
{"text":"Family style Italian cuisine- delicious, generous- had to take home- dinner and lunch the next day! No comparison to the horrible Olive Gardens we have in NM. Also noticed a big difference between Bucca in Vegas and the one in Alb- I thought chains all carried the same standards and quality? Anywhooooo- this is a great place to eat while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to several Bucatini Di Beppo restaurant - Louisville, Colorado Springs.  I loved them, but this one needs some serious cleaning.  And I got sick on my last visit so I'm a bit cautious to go back."}
{"text":"We came here to use up a gift card that was given to us for Xmas.  We ordered the small portions because it was just the two of us.  It wasn't enough though. So I had to keep asking for more bread.  But I go here just to have to the Veal or Chicken Saltimboca.  It's soo good.  We also had the chocolate cake.  It was hard to track down our server whenever we needed something.  That was the downside."}
{"text":"Came to this location last week with another couple. 

We ordered an appetizer of calamari, I didn't have any but the other 3 in my group loved it. So I had my fill of bread which is served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I don't know if it was just our server but the ratio was way off, more vinegar would have been ideal. 

I think saying the entrees will feed 2 or more is extremely misleading, we ordered 2 entrees based on the suggestion it would be more than enough. It wasn't. 

We had one order of Cheese Ravioli and one order of Chicken Marsala.

The sauce on the Ravioli was bland, not a lot of flavor. 
The Chicken Marsala had a great flavor but just three small pieces of chicken and nothing else. I really expected it to come with a little pasta or potatoes. Very disappointing. 

I left with 3 people who weren't full and with a lot less cash in our pockets."}
{"text":"I shouldn't have to ask for bread with oil and vinegar.

I shouldn't have to ask for refills.

I shouldn't have to sit in a boiling hot dining room when other rooms (being much, much cooler) are open and available.  The fat man at the next table smelled like their greasy trash compactor.

I've never been impressed with the service here.  The food is only ok.  They stress the large portion sizes because it appears there is nothing special about the quality of the food.  And the nudity on the walls makes this place entirely inappropriate for children or immature adults."}
{"text":"I went there with my Family over easter weekend.  

The service staff I would give 5 stars to.  

HOWEVER, This being my first experience at Buca Di Beppo, I expected at least Olive Garden Quality.  My Nephew and I shared the Spaghetti and Meatballs.  The Meatballs were yummy, however there was a complete lack of sauce on the pasta.  The meatballs maybe had a ladle of sauce, but the pasta had what I would call tomato water under the meatballs.  Not yummy!  

The Pizza was crisp on the edges however the dough was soggy under the toppings.  I did like what my niece had, I don't remember the name, it was Chicken Alfredo, Sausage macaroni basically. 

 I would give this a higher rating however in terms of value to money spent I felt this place needs to apologize for itself.  The food is mediocre, the pricing is too high for bad food.  At least at the Olive Garden I get a fresh salad that comes with my dinner, not here, it's ala-carte.  I think I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $18 for Spaghetti and meatballs.  

Any one who's ever been to a church spaghetti social can tell you that for $5 you can get a plate of pasta with a rich meaty sauce that is way better than this place.  While the church Spaghetti comes with a little guilt, Buca's comes with shame.

I'm sorry Buca - But this was a fail."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying we go to Bucca about every 4 weeks, kids love it, my wife and I love it, and the food/service is great. Msybr last night was a fluke.

We stopped by last night for dinner around 7pm. Happy to see there was no wait on a Friday night.  We were seated promptly and a server came by to take our drink orders. Unfortunately, that was the best service the entire night. (Travis noted someone else would take over).

We placed our order of 2 kids chicken parms and a small Shrimp Fra Diablo. We knew it would be spicy since we had it before.....we just didnt know it would be flaming hot. 2 forkfills in and both my mouth and my wife's were on fire. My forehead was like a waterfall. If only we could let our server know it was way too spicy........ah, our server. 

Our server was MIA the entire meal. Checked in before we started to eat and asked if we needed anything else. 'More bread please.' Now, if you've ever been to Bucca,  you know you gotta have bread and dip it on the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Problem was, our server brought us what seemed to be 4-5 inch mini loaf of bread, cut into 4 pieces. There were 4 of us so you do the math. 

Once the bread was dropped, either 'C' forgot about us, took her break, we turned invisible, however you want to describe it, but we never saw her again until the end of the meal. No drink refills, no 'how's everything tasting?', nothing. Can you please bring back Travis?

Our small SFD was probably only 10% eaten due to its extreme spiciness. Now, my wife loves spicy food, so you know its gotta be way too spicy if she complains. Ever have that let down because you craved a certain dish and it was totally not what hoped for or expected? Yeah, it was one of those nights.  

Our server 'C' finally materialized and asked if we needed a box. We did take the overly spicy  leftovers and we'll give it another shot at home. I had a $20 coupon from Bucca that i used, and, because of our stellar service, i tipped on post coupon amount and a tad over 10%. Sorry, no way tipping my standard 20% on PRE coupon amount.  

Some takeaways......Bucca, maybe in the future you could ask patrons what level of spiciness they would like their food, like our favorite Thai restaurant does? Second, customers, ask to NOT be seated far in the back as you will be in the forgotten zone and never see your server. Finally, to Bucca again, how about the manager makes his/her rounds and check in on patrons?"}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes for someone to greet us. 45 minutes for a drink and almost an hour for bread. There were like 20 people at the bar and we were seated in that area. No one helped the bartender (who was also our waiter) until I got up and said something to the manager. My husband never got the coke he ordered. Overall, we were pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"My son had just come in from his Army MP Graduation and wanted Buca for dinner. We live locally so Buca is a restaurant we frequent often. Sad to say. The food was terrible. Ordered a Lasagna and a Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. The Bread was stale, the pasta wad soggy and the sauce tasted old. Suffice to say, this was the worst experience we have had at Buca. 5 people in our party and we all agreed it tasted pretty horrible, making for a ruined celebration. My wife anf I both have had stomach pain since last night. Never again! The manager did offer to replace the lasagna? With what, another bad lasagna?"}
{"text":"Ate at this location last Sunday with my wife and daughter.  Very good food and huge portions!!  We ordered the \"Bucca Small\" size lasagna and still had plenty to take home with us, and I'm a plenty big eater!  We also tried the sampler appetizer with fried raviolis, cheese sticks and calamari.  It was also excellent, the calamari was particularly good and prepared just right to be tender and not tough.

The meatballs are a Bucca signature dish as each one is 1/2 lb.  They are a must try and are very good and taste homemade.  The prices are a little higher than you would pay in an family restaurant like Olive Garden, however it is an excellent spot to celebrate Valentine's Day, a birthday or special occasion.  Very excellent Italian cuisine, we will definately try it again soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of the  meals that I really enjoyed while in Vegas. It's not the place to go if you are in a hurry.

 If I have the time to enjoy a good Italian meal in an atmosphere that is relaxing and visually appealing that's also quiet enough to engage in good conversation this is the place for me! I loved the food, traditional Italian, not over done. I'll go back."}
{"text":"More like Buca de PooPoo...we went here for my mom's birthday but only because we had the twenty dollar off coupon. First things first, the door didn't open properly. 0/10 entrance. My mom presented the coupon and the waiter proceeded to card my mom pretty brusquely. Then when we ordered our food the waiter put on an extra meatball and asked if it was ok. I mean, duh! More meatballs! However he failed to tell us that it was an extra seven dollars. Then the sauce was watery. Didn't expect much. Afterwards they sang to my mom for her bday however we didn't even get a small slice of cake or scoop of something, just a giant candle that my 5'1 mom had to stand up to blow out. The coupon even said we could get a cake but under some bs reservation conditions. Like wtf...we could've gotten a cheaper better meal at red lobster and gotten some free cake. Crossed this restaurant off our list!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Thursday for my birthday dinner. 

We were seated immediately and were addressed promptly by our server. 

We did not receive the house bread, which bummed hubby out. Its his favorite. 

Each of us ordered our own small meal and a side of cheese bread (best thing ever) 

Our food was delicious however my husband took a bite of some of his food and found a small metal wire in his food. It did cut the inside of his gum. We brought it to the attention of our server. She apologized and brought it to her managers attention. They did comp his meal but the manager never came out to discuss it with us. We wanted to know what it was from but the server told us she didn't know. 

Besides that, the meal and food was great. Our server was great. 

Just not happy with the attention level of the manager. You would think with the amount of money you spend at this restaurant it would be more attentive."}
{"text":"Me and my husband got take out from here and we're not impressed, to say the least...  We got fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was horribly bland. It tasted like nothing. The mozerella garlic bread just tasted like fried bread- there was no flavor or seasoning and you couldn't even taste the mozzarella.  

The food was supposed to be ready at a certain time but it took them 20 minutes to get us the food (and we even arrived 5 minutes behind schedule). It was our first time here and the signs for take out said 'curb side service' but no one ever came out so we had to go in and the hostesses weren't exactly helpful or welcoming- indifferent is a good word.  Perhaps online it should state you need to go in to pick up the food (as some resteraunts actually take it out to you when you order to go and paid online already) or change the signs that say 'curb side service' because this is misleading.

After waiting 20 minutes to get our food that we had ordered an hour earlier- you would think it would be piping hot but it was more like lukewarm- and that's being generous.

The portion size was pretty big, we got the smaller size and I think it could feed at least three people or more...

Unfortunatley the food here is just blah and we will not be returning, first impressions and all...

If you are looking for good Italian food- keep looking!"}
{"text":"Food was substandard and options really really limited on the midnight (if you call 11:30 pm midnight in Vegas) menu. The margarita was below average."}
{"text":"At 5pm on a Saturday, my visiting niece decided that she was really in the mood for Italian for dinner, so, after 15 phone calls to totally booked restaurants, we ended up at Bucca di Beppo at Station Square...
You all know the set up...family style, \"Small\" dishes serve 2-3, \"Large\" are for 4-5.
For 4 of us we ordered a pasta, a meat, and a salad to start, all smalls, and well enough food.

The bread is the \"Italitan\" equivalent of Wonder Bread...soft, flavorless, no crust to speak of, but at least they bring olive oil (with a little balsamic) to dip it in,

The Caesar salad was perfectly ok.

The \"Famous\" Spaghetti and Meatballs...OK, the meatballs are quite good...really nice texture, and a good, if not exciting flavor, and the pasta was correctly cooked. But the sauce...A few squashed canned tomatoes and at least a pint of tomatoey water. No real seasoning or flavor whatsoever. It might have helped if the grated cheese was, in fact, Parmesan or Peccorino Romano, but it tasted like it was all filler...which is to say that it really didn't taste...at all.

But...

The Veal Saltimboca was, surprisingly, quite good...nicely cooked, the veal tender, the ham nicely done, and the artichokes grilled...very good, really.

I think, if I were to go there again, I would order a meat or two, and get a side order of fettuccini Alfredo, which is hard to screw up."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the chicken pasta with artichokes and the pasta with shrimp was delicious. Casual and dark, in Excalibur, moderate piece- huge quantity - great prices."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give our server Joe a shout out! He was friendly and attentive.  First time bringing my parents here and he helped us order, recommended the pepperoni pizza and boy it did not disappoint! The spicy shrimp appetizer was my favorite.  Calamari sauce was heavenly.   We ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni as well.  Wonderful evening with the family,  awesome decor and I love the family style of the restaurant.  Will come back again and again"}
{"text":"It's easier to count the things right than wrong with this place. 'Free' birthday brownie cost $5 on the bill, waitresses response was 'sorry' as she walked away. Food tastes as if it has been sitting all day then microwaved. The taste in my mind was this, think of a catered lunch at work and you miss out when it is initially served. Go back a few hours later, pick up a few soggy pieces of chicken parm and throw them into the microwave. Presto, you have our experience tonight. Portions are good, but good portions of crap is still crap. After coming here for my wife's birthday and us all leaving feeling less than satisfied I will not be back here, and would not recommend this place to anyone. For less than half the $100 bill we could have went to Olive Garden and had better food with less of a headache."}
{"text":"The location is convenient and I think it's nice to have a real restaurant attached to the mall. I think Buca is somewhere between Olive Garden and Biaggi's. I've never had a salad here I DID like, which is surprising. It's also disappointing because they do have the family sized servings, so it's a total waste if you're unsatisfied with something. The pasta is always al dente and tastes good. My children are in love with the fettuccine alfredo, but I think it's a little lackluster. I have tried the eggplant parmesan and it was far too chewy and tough to manage. The chicken dishes have always been pleasing and satisfying. Adult beverage selections are limited and pricey compared to other restaurants.

Make sure you get the house bread with the balsamic/oil mix. That's the best part of the meal!"}
{"text":"It pains me write a bad review for Buca because I generally really like this place and have been here for years. I typically switch it up between 7 or 8 different entrees. This time we got lasagna which was good (no complaints) but the chicken carbonara was just terrible. I never remembered it tasting this bad. Chicken was extremely bland, flavor just wasn't there: like I said I go here around 10 times a year but very disappointed in quality now"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and although the portions were big enough the food was extremely bland and seemed to be rushly made. A kid in the booth behind was trying his darndest to skewer me with his fork from over the seat back. Told him to stop but the mother did nothing to dissuade the poor mannered tike. Probably came on a bad day as I have been in their Buccos that were run according to hoyle. Orders came out in the wrong order and no one seemed to want to address  the elephant in the room. The kid with the weapon narrowingly slicing into a part of my anatomy. Meh to you and unless your food and service improves it will not be one of the many place I frequent."}
{"text":"I will definately be coming back in the future! Food was real real good. Highly reccommend the brussel sprouts, shrimp florentine, and canolis. Service was amazing, ask for Jarrett!"}
{"text":"Attended a pre-wedding private party at this establishment this past weekend.  I had trepidations about this restaurant as a native New Yorker and Italian, I was not sure of the authenticity of the Italian food.  Boy was I wrong!!!  It was amazing!!!!  The food tasted authentic, delicious and plentiful.  The drinks were superb.  The service was fantastic!!!  I know there is now one in NYC and plan to bring friends and family there!!!"}
{"text":"The service here was awful. We had a total of 4 people in our party and were treated horribly. I would honestly rather eat at one of the fast food places in out hotel before we come back. Our server didn't clear our plates once, took 15 mins to cash out one bill with cash, we were not given any refills of beverages, nor thanked once when we left. Also, we went to the bar for drinks before our dinner and when we asked the happy hour specials, we were thrown a menu at us and told \"these are it.\" At least at Dicks last resort they have an excuse to be rude.... Def last time coming here."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

I have been a fan of the Buca chain for a bit now as it tries to survive the Olive Garden, Bertuccis and Maggiano's Italian restaurant chain war so we decided to give this location a try. As always they serve the small-large option so I went with the small as I feel it feeds one person with left overs in that regard. So to start we got the meatballs appetizer which was actually really good had that little bit of browning to the meat ball and great taste so A+ on that and a mixed Milan Mule cocktail that went well with the food.

Main course went with the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni which was ahh ok.. now I've had this dish 2 other times and both were better then his location and serving size seemed a bit less. Some how it seemed like the sauce was a bit less spicy and if I recall it used to be a bit more of a blush sauce but either way it seemed lacking in taste. Now you can opt for extra spicy but I never recall having to.  My girlfriend got the Penne al Forno which was really good and seemed to be the better choice.

The staff were friendly, the location was typical inside with all the pictures and relaxing interior. They have an outside location which is different then some other locations. You can park at the outdoor lot or garage which runs around $5. 

I would give them 3 1/2 if I could on the review just seemed like it needed a bit more kick in the pants taste wise on my dish but it won't stop me from returning I still like this local option over Olive Garden at times.

Bucca I'm still a fan and will return!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice but the food was pretty pricey for what they gave you. Food was okay, not great. Food took a while to get to us as well. It's okay if you're staying at the Excalibur but there are better Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for any special occasion I may have. They always know how to make our visit just great thanks to Josh"}
{"text":"The food was ok. I would rather go to a Mararoni grill. Waiter brought the food we ordered to the wrong table"}
{"text":"My sister and a friend are here a few years ago and both had good things to say. So we all decided to go together. My first visit. 
The consensus:  very disappointing. 
Ordered a salad, chicken dish and bowl of  fettuccini pasta. The chicken was made from a frozen breast and was a relatively tasteless dish. Also, not as large of a serving as I was told to expect from their \"family style\" menu.  The fettuccini Alfredo was also a small portion even though we ordered the \"large\" bowl size. The sauce tasted like canned Alfredo sauce and the dish was served like warm. Best part of the meal was the Apple Gorgonzola salad. I honestly could not recommend this restaurant and do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"I recently moved from San Francisco where Buca di Beppo was a huge hit. 

When I saw one close by to my new house in Las Vegas, I got really excited. 

Believe me, the food is just as amazing as it was in SF but it's the service at this location that really sets it apart from other restaurants.

The last few times I've gone, I had Sarah as a waitress. She's very knowledgable about the menu, she has a great attitude, and she's also very understanding/accommodating. The last time me and my boyfriend came in, we walked in 5 minutes before they closed and dined in. We felt really guilty about holding the staff passed closing but everyone, and I mean everyone including the manager, was really sweet! Lewis, the Sous Chef, brought our starter and entree out. At the end of the meal, he came back around to ask how we enjoyed everything. I was highly impressed. It really showed a sense of compassion towards the establishment to see the Chef come out and ask how everything was. It was completely professional and very much appreciated. 

The entrees are HUGE and even the \"Small\" can easily feed two really hungry people. The Baked Ziti with a side of Garlic Cheesy bread is really good. The Shrimp Florentine is also really delicious! Come to think of it, I haven't tried anything from Buca that I haven't liked.

Long story short, this place is AWESOME! The service, the food, and overall atmosphere is an A+. 

Definitely one of my favorite places to dine, don't be surprised if you see me there if you go in to eat :)"}
{"text":"Oh My Gawd!!! 

1st the decor - its like my Sicily grandmother can't to visit, feels like home.
 
2nd the folks - we got to sit in the kitchen and the show was awesome.. Ray,  Jeremy, Mo, Andrew and Norrese were so friendly and entertaining.. Norrese showed is every plate going out too help us make up our minds. 

3rd the food - it was amazing, they are going to have to took me or of here... 

If you come here be ready eat or take home leftovers because the portions are huge... If you are 3 or less small is fine"}
{"text":"Myself, along with other members of my family  from Richmond, VA were visiting family in Pittsburgh when we tried Buca di Beppo. Not having one in Virginia, we thought it would be a great way to feed multiple people in the most economically way. Waitstaff was really friendly.  We ordered five different dishes that unfortunately had to be brought out at different times because there was a collision in the kitchen which sacrificed two of the meals. The food that came out was dry as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The server also inquired about one dish whether or not it had soy and reported that it didnt so we ordered... Come to find out it actually did have soy in it and told us when it was served. Had we known that, we wouldnt have ordered it. Although our time there was a complete disappointment, the head cook came out from the kitchen to apologize and completely comped our meal! I would give this restaurant another try solely based off the fact that they had outstanding customer service!"}
{"text":"We waited for 20mins. No waiter came to take our order. We even asked for it. Eventually we left without being served. However, the atmosphere is nice and a lot of room. But overall, we left hungry and disappointed. I don't recommend this place. :)"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 8 people the night before Saint Patrick's day /a busy busy night- the only problem was , in error I made my online reservation for the wrong date & showed up with 8 people , oops! I explained my situation to manager Lorenzo Shaw and he did some maneuvering for us and accommodated our party by actually making room for a table in the bar area! Wow so so nice of him and he did it with a smile and made us so welcomed to his restaurant as busy as they were ! I was very impressed and am so appreciative of what he did for my family! It made an  awful situation into a great night for us! We had a delicious meal & a terrific evening thanks to Lorenzo Shaw !"}
{"text":"I dine here quite often, the food is always fresh & delicious! Rivals any fine Italian restaurant on the strip. The manager Robert was very gracious in taking our coupon even tho we had already paid -our fault- and he was jus so accommodating ! I must also mention Cindy who is always there & is very nice & so helpful we always have a nice conversation ! Thanks buca for great food & great service ! Loyal customer !"}
{"text":"Done with food and still haven't received our coffee and juice?! The hostess had to come and help us."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on St. Patrick's Day hoping to escape the crowds and definitely found it at Buca. When we came into the restaurant, they took us through the kitchen first and all of the cooks greeted us warmly. There were a variety of \"rooms\" each with a different theme, and the host explained them to us on a short tour on the way to our seats. It was really neat!

We really liked that the meals were served family style, and they were well-priced. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the Quattro al Forno platter along with a couple of beers (because it was St. Paddy's Day, not because beer really seems to go with Italian food at all). I loved the food, especially the creamy pesto sauce that came with the stuffed mushrooms. The service was phenomenal; the waiter checked on us frequently to fill our waters and was prompt with serving our food and giving us the bill when we asked.

We came in with a $10 off a $20 meal coupon, and they'd given us two more before we left.  We would have come back anyway paying full price. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Make sure you are not in a hurry. The food is fair... All is family style. Service is so slow, they must be undertsaffed. We came because someone in our party has a coupon. Not my favorite italian place."}
{"text":"Made it to the lunch special I love it here the food is always good and big portions. Their service is great the environment is peace full and makes me feel like a real Italian."}
{"text":"I love Buca, but this specific location has a cowardly manager. Went here on Veterans Day with my parents, both Veterans, for dinner. When we walked in, the first thing we asked the hostess is if they had any specials for the holiday. She said \"Yes, you get 10% off of your bill!\" Delighted, we decided to make Buca our spot for the night. Spending over $140, we get our bill with no discount. When asking our very nice waitress about the 10% courtesy, she explained that the discount was only given if you presented a coupon sent through an email. We politely asked to speak to the manager to express our disappointment with the miscommunication and the waitress obliged. She returned 15 minutes later ALONE and informed us that the manager was busy and that he said there is \"nothing he can do, no exceptions.\" Nice dude, reeeal nice. I guess losing long time customers is not a concern. 5% off or a simple apology would have been plenty sufficient but instead we received the cold shoulder. That's a nice thank you to the men and women who have served your country..."}
{"text":"The food is dangeroliously delicious. I have used them for catering before and it always goes off without a hitch. The portion sizes are the same as if you were dining in. The employees are awesome here. Despite this place being crazy busy they managed the madness effectively. 

The boxes and bags are super sturdy so you don't have to worry about everything collapsing on you as you walk to your car. They will give you plates and utensils and even parmesean cheese if you ask. 

Seriously if you're in a pinch and or don't want to deal with the hassle of cooking for a large group you have to try Bocas catering service. I added an item at the last minute when I arrived and they didn't fret about that at all. They simply added it up and charged me. 

The price point is spot on considering all of the food you get. The quality is crazy good. 

Here's the 5 star factor. It just smells so damn good as soon as you get out of your car. That sweet smell only gets better the closer you get. Once your inside you don't want to leave."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said by those who've left 1-2 star reviews? There are very few positive things to say. Salad was decent. Bread was undercooked. Fettuccine had no seasoning, not even salt or pepper. Eggplant was a bit mushy. Spaghetti and meatballs were also lacking in flavor. The tomato \"sauce\" was really just crushed tomatoes and not saucy. Gelato was decent. Overall, the food disappointed big time. 

Our group of 14 had the distinct pleasure of sitting in the creepy Pope Room. There is a bust of a Pope in the middle of the round table. Weird. And tons of Pope-related pictures on the walls. The room itself is too small for people to get in and out easily. No music, too bright, too stuffy. Stay away from this room, even for a large party. And the giant lazy Susan just makes things awkward when people on opposite sides try to move it in opposite directions. 

Service is slow. We had one server for our whole table. Nice guy and did okay for having such a big table. 

Drinks at the bar were overpriced. 12.99 for one shot of crown royal. On the strip I would understand, but not for a mediocre chain restaurant off the strip. And the bar tenders appeared to be arguing with each other while at the bar. 

Girlfriend said bathroom could use some attention. 

Not coming back. You've been warned people. Don't expect much."}
{"text":"Buca's is amazing!!!  We first went to one in California and now that we are moving to the Charlotte area we are sure to come to Buca's for family fun!  We had the Apple Gorgonzola salad that even my 10 year old son liked! Then we had the Chicken Marsala and mash potatoes and topped it off with chocolate cake.  My children enjoyed their make your own brownie dessert in the kitchen too!  Thanks Norrese Ball and the service team for a wonderful evening!!!"}
{"text":"After speaking to the area manager.  We decided to go back and give bucca another try.  We went today and it was great.  Jarrett our waiter was awesome.  Thank you again sven."}
{"text":"Live buca in Seattle...figured same service.  Receptionist  very friendly. ...From Tacoma of course! Our waiter seemed totally disinterested  in us. Had to ask for refills of drinks....everytime.  food was good...as usual....til I saw a small roach on my table.  I jumped up....killed it. He came to table asked if all was ok. I pointed to animal I squished on floor. His response. ...oh yeah. Ignored. Brought us take home Containers. ....set them on table. Never picked up dirty plates or offered to box  our meal....that came to 70 for is. Disappointed  and last time at this Buca.....too bad."}
{"text":"Awesome! We celebrated my sister's birthday here last night and our server Colin was amazing! We have a pretty large family so there was a lot going on but he we very patient and fun! Our experience was great! The food was delicious (as always) and the birthday song is on the place mats so you can sing along! Everything was great, everyone was happy! Food is great! Customer service is awesome, thank you Colin!"}
{"text":"The worst Italian food I can remember The sauce is flavorless and the chicken bland. No idea what they were calling a cannoli. On The other hand, the service was absolutely fantastic. That's the only reason I gave it a two otherwise I would've been stretching to give it a one."}
{"text":"Our first time here was on April 16th for my moms birthday and my brother confirmation dinner because we wanted to see what the place was all about. 

As soon as you enter, it looks pretty small because of the smaller size of the entrance/waiting area, however as soon as you walk into the dining area it is a HUGE maze of tables and walkways, perfect for large groups or small groups. We definitely did not see any wall that was not interesting to look at. 

The service was pretty good. We had a friendly waiter, and the host and hostess were nice as we entered. I think the only thing I would've appreciated was more info on how to order/what to order. Portion size was what we were confused on when it came to entrees/pastas and sides. Thankfully we came with two of our cousins that had been there before to explain it to us when they arrived a bit later. 

The food was amazing! That's the best part. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with anything you order, so just go for it! We even were surprised with a slice of \"celebration cake\" and the birthday/celebration song sung by the waiters at the end of our meal. Thanks Buca for a good night :) (but please don't run out of Calamari right before we order it!)"}
{"text":"This Buca is pretty standard if you've visited the franchise before. The ambiance is nice, the servers are friendly, and the food is high-quality. As is the case with many other Vegas franchises, the prices are higher than what you would pay at another location. Despite this, however, the portions are large and tasty. I would recommend the Mixed Antipasto Salad, Linguini Frutti di Mare, and Baked Rigatoni. Additionally, if you have a sweet tooth like me, be sure to get the tiramisu: it's fantastically rich, creamy and absolutely delicious. All in all a good choice if you're looking for filling food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"After 8 of us arrived 10 minutes early for our 7 o'clock reservation, we were told that our table required a minimum of 10 people to be seated. Waitstaff rushed around, managers (and even cooks) came out to update us on the status of our table and at 7:40, we were finally seated... on the chilly patio.

It took a while for our waitress to arrive to take orders, but one of the cooks was nice enough to send out 3 appetizers gratis for our long wait time. Food appeared in a decent amount if time and it was standard Buca fare. There was enough to feed an army, with a ton of leftovers to take home.

We frequent this location every year around the first of October and most likely will be back in 2013. Hopefully next time it won't be so hard to get a seat!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic family dinner!  Our waitress Jenna was the best most professional yet welcoming person!  The food came out hot and plentiful.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I made reservations online for the day of my daughters 19th Birthday. It's her favorite place for bday celebrations. I was apprehensive because we haven't had great luck at a Buca that was closer to our house. Had a bday and it wasn't even mentioned. We even told them when we checked in. Anyway, everything started off great when we entered the restaurant and said we had a reservation and they immediate knew it was us. And acknowledged my daughters birthday which made her happy and made me breathe a sigh of relief. 

The server was great. And as usual, the food like at all Buca's was excellent! 

A very good time. Thank you so much for making it special!"}
{"text":"I love Buca! I think it is much better than the \"other\" Italian chains! It is family style, where you get everything on a platter or in a large bowl and share with others at your table. The server says at lunch you can order single meals as well. The Chicken Parm is the best I have had. We also get the half pound meatballs! The are unbelieveably good! The sauces are all made in the restaurant, which is why it tastes so good! LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Very nice environment with family style service; good for a larger group meal.
Not impressed by their food, though."}
{"text":"Worst service at any restaurant we have ever been to. Took 30 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation , then it took another 20 minutes after we were seated to get service.  Our food took another 25 minutes to arrive at the table, and then was served cold! And they brought the wrong salad order. 
We complained to our server, who then gave us a long explanation that they were short-handed because no one wanted to work because they had money from their tax returns. Also one of the employees had been killed in a car accident the week before, so those who did show up to work were depressed.  
OK, we just asked for different food that was at least warm, and she again reiterated, they were short handed so it would probably be at least another 20 minutes. We said, we just want hot  food. 
17 minutes later food arrived back \"warm\" not hot. We ate a bit and asked for to-go boxes. Another 10 minutes and we got to-go boxes and the check. We had decided not to say anything to the manager, because of the employee death, we were just going to pay and go.
As we were walking out the manager asked us if everything was ok, so we responded and told her about the negative experience. She literally shrugged and said the same thing the server did about taxes, the car accident etc.  never once did she apologize, or offer a coupon, or free dessert etc.  She clearly did not give a damn.
We will not be going back there, and none of our friends and acquaintances are like to go back there either after hearing of our experience. 

Still no response from management..."}
{"text":"Gross!!!  This place is dirty and the food was horrible.   We arrived at 8pm and waited until almost 9pm for our food.   We ordered chicken with lemon and capers, 3 tiny pieces of overcooked chicken, probably a total of 8 ounces for $23!  Then came the ravioli which was watery with some canned tomatoes on top.  

And then they start cleaning up the room we were in, sweeping the floors while we ate!  They probably wouldn't pass a health department inspection. 

Would have given 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Looking for a place to eat in Pittsburgh and the hotel staff at the Hilton directed our group of teachers (from Maryland) here and supplied the free shuttle from the hotel.  The atmosphere was nice (though the table next to ours was a bit loud).  Food was excellent and huge portions, even though we ordered off the single-serve menu, rather than the family style, because we had to have itemized receipts for our expense accounts.  I got eggplant parmigiana and it was the best I've ever had. I couldn't even eat the spaghetti that came with it as the serving was huge!  Other diners in the group were pleased with their choices as well.  We shared an appetizer sampler that consisted of calamari, shrimps, and mozzarella.  I didn't taste the cheese, but the rest was quite good.  Our server was excellent and attended to every detail.  When faced with the task of five separate bills and the complications that go along with that, she smiled and treated us like celebrities.
This is the funny part--the walls of Buca di Beppo are plastered with pictures of all sizes and shapes.  At first, nothing seems out of the ordinary.  But on closer examination, some pictures reveal strange little inconsistencies that cause one to do a double-take.  For example, Mona Lisa topless!  Needless to say, we had quite a few laughs over these.  My personal favorite was a little Easter Bunny--or so it appeared on first glance.  I'll leave the rest up to you... Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I usually love the Buca di Beppo restaurants. I have been many, many times when I lived in San Francisco and I have always loved it. However, I had the worst experience at this location in Las Vegas. 

 We arrived at the restaurant after 3pm for a late lunch. Although the restaurant was almost completely empty, when we asked for a table, we were told to sit on the bench outside and that we would have to wait a few minutes. We saw the hostess constantly running around looking like she was very busy and talking on the phone. Keep in mind that the restaurant was empty, so I am not sure what she was running around doing. We asked for our table again, but we were once again told to wait. After almost 15 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. During this time, two other couples were also told to wait, and they also left. To add insult to the injury, she had a horrible attitude - she was quite rude and dismissive, acting like we were doing something horrible by making her get up and do her job. Definitely the worst service I have experienced in a long time (if not the worst service I have EVER experienced).

Honestly, the entire thing is a mystery to me, as I have always loved this restaurant, but I guess they need major re-training of their staff. If I could give it zero stars, I would, but I can't, so I'm giving it - grudgingly - 1 star."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was even better. Last time we came here our son was going into the Air force.  It has been too long since visits."}
{"text":"Quick service made reservations at 8:30 was done by 9:26. I had chicken parmesan and my boyfriend had the spaghetti meatballs both were good. The total was $68 which isn't bad considering the amount of food. My only  recommendations are that the sauce was watery and when I asked the server for a little cup of sauce she brought me one then charged me for it without a heads up."}
{"text":"We were told it would be an hour wait. After an hour and half we go and ask the hostess how much longer. They gave our table to someone else because they responded to our name, while we were at the bar while a few members of our party got a drink while we waited to be seated; even though we had checked in with the hostess shortly before the hour to make sure we didn't miss our name to be seated. They made sure to seat us at table right away after realizing that they gave our table to someone else. No big deal, we understand it wasn't the the hostess fault that same a-hole took our table, but after waiting an hour and half; we were told our order of food would take 45 minutes to come out before we had even placed our order. We were only a group of four.  Tried to go on the website to offer a suggestion on their corporate page but they had no option for that so instead I'm putting it on yelp. A buzzer, a number anything to identify which guest come at which time would have been nice in this instance. Needless to say, we ended up going to a fast food joint because after waiting for almost two hours for just a table we didn't want to wait 45 minutes to eat."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here often; my office is near Buca. Food is amazing, service always good! I have the spaghetti with shrimp, a fresh salad, and sparkling water.  Always hits the spot and not expensive. Bread is always fresh and I love the decor. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  First, I really hate that they walk you through the kitchen on your way to your table.  It seems so unsanitary.  

Then, as soon as we sit down, the up-selling starts.  I really, really hate it when a server goes over and over the drinks and appetizers trying to up-sell you.  I can read a menu.  I don't need every drink and appetizer described to me.  Same thing with dessert.  I understand that you see my children and think that by going on and on about the desserts that my children are going to beg and plead to get dessert and that I'll cave.  Nope - not going to happen. 

I had the bruschetta and it was such a huge disappointment.  It was chopped tomatoes slapped on top of a huge loaf of garlic bread.  The best part of real bruschetta is the crispy, toasted bread followed by the garlicy tomato topping.  This was nothing more than diced tomatoes with no seasoning on top of a huge loaf of bread - the result was bland and mushy and nearly impossible to eat.  seriously gross. 

We then had the chicken pesto pizza.  Again - gross.  It was positively dripping in pesto cream sauce.  It had so much sauce on it that the cheese on top slid off and the sauce dripped all over the place.  Really, really unpleasant.  

Also, we were there at 4:30 so the place wasn't busy yet but, the service moved at a turtles pace.  Maybe it was so slow because the server was up-selling every other table as well.  On and on and on.......about the appetizers, drinks etc....  

Overall a huge disappointment.  I will not go back there again."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for work functions and overall this place is in the middle when it comes to Italian places.  The food is just O.K.  Most of the items I have tried I feel any average person could make at home and the quality would be the same.  

The sauce doesn't have a lot of flavor depth but not bad in taste either.  It is a great place for a large group as the atmosphere is fun and inviting.  It is also family style so you can try a number of different items at a time.  The wait staff has always been great when I have gone.  They check in with you pretty regularly.  

They do have a pretty cool/creepy pope head table that is set on a Lazy Susan so it spins.  You can always have fun turning it to awkwardly stare at other members of your party through out the night.  Overall I just do not have a lot to say as there was not any thing particular  good or bad that stuck out to me.  It is just very middle of the rode."}
{"text":"Meh! Brought the family here due to a gift card that I received as a gift. Hostesses and wait staff was friendly enough. We got seated right away and got our food relatively quickly. The kids ordered off the kids menu, which listed that drinks are included. They both got chocolate milk. The food was bland and unimpressive. But what irked me was that we were charged separately for the kids chocolate milks. I reminded the waiter that they're supposed to be included, but he explained that only the fountain drinks are included. REALLY? It did not say that in the kids menu and I, like many parents I know, don't even give my kids any carbonated beverages. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We always enjoy going here but tonight I discovered that they deliver! Our food was hot, garlic bread was fresh and they gave us everything that we needed to enjoy our meal at home. The best part is not dragging two toddlers to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Buca is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I visited there around lunch time and got seated promptly. The waiter was very attentive and I felt very well taken care of. Each dish was cooked perefectly and the porportions were amazing!"}
{"text":"Buca Di Beppo is amazing! Our server, Nikki, was absolutely wonderful. Every server/staff member member we encountered was incredibly friendly. The pizza Bianca was amazing as well. 10/10 will return soon :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time with the Champaign location. I usually eat at the Phoenix AZ one and I give them a 5! This one was good, menu has changed some. Service was great. Food was good. Our mozzarella appetizer could have been much warmer so the cheese was more \"stringy\" but entrees where good. They do serve family style but do single entrees as well. Prices are very reasonable. I would dine again."}
{"text":"Buca Di Beppo...hard to go wrong here. Old school family style eating. 

This place is dated, but part of its history. It's been around a long time. Not real fancy. Pretty simple. Clean. Friendly environment.

At this particular restaurant, our server was kind, fast, and attentive. We never went unnoticed with an empty glass. :) Gave us a brief tutorial on how it works around there. Food servings are large. It's Vegas...a little pricey. But definitely a lot of food. You won't leave here hungry at all. 

Drinks were also pretty delicious. I don't know why, but I was kind of surprised. But yeah, our drinks were delicious, good pours, and nice presentation. 

So yeah, if you are in the mood for Italian, super hungry, this is definitely a recommended spot. We didn't have any wait times to be seated when we met....it's not the flashiest spot, so, I can imagine it doesn't get super busy here. 

We'll definitely come back here when we are in the mood for Italian."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Service is horrible. We were sitting near the bar and we had some loud guests. So we asked  the waiter if we can move to a much quieter location.. we didnt get any help, so we moved ourselfs after 15 minutes of waiting to be moved. We apparently sat in a location, where a party was going to be hosted.. did not know that until the waiters started to gossip and gave us some dirty looks. I stood up and politely told them we did not like the way they acted. All an all, i wanted it to put that all to the side because it is my wife birthday. I will recommend this place but be aware, u may receive poor quality of service."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my late mothers birthday. Buca was her favorite place, she loved the pasta San Remo. This is my 2nd yr celebrating her birthday here enjoying our favorite meal. The service was fantastic, I couldn't have had a better server for this special day. My Chopped Antipasto salad was delicious and so was the pasta San Remo. The bread was warm and fresh. Love and miss you mama, my sweet love bug!!!"}

{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018: 38/100

Big Tip: Sign up for their email list because they always mail you coupons, pretty much the only reason why I still come to Buca now is because some of their coupons have pretty good deals!

My boyfriend and I are cheapskates, we only come to Buca when they have good coupons, and the best ones are the ones where you can order takeout and take $20 off. This time, we decided to dine in since the coupon specifically requires that you dine in. 

We weren't aware that Buca doesn't serve table bread to you. When our waitress asked if we wanted bread, we said we would like some (come on, who would refuse *free* bread?!). Turns out, it's not actually free, and I felt slightly scammed because why would she ask in such a way when it's not provided? 

Other than that, Buca is Buca. Large portions Italian food that will literally stuff you for 3 meals. My bf and I opted for the build your own pasta, along with some Brussels sprouts with Prosciutto. The Brussels sprouts were not bad, and the portion was larger than other restaurants (given that it was also $11 and that it is Buca). 

Overall meh experience. For the price that I paid (even after the coupon), I felt cheated because of the bread. Probably sticking to getting takeout for a long time."}
{"text":"I had been to Buca di Beppo once way back in the year 2000 and had fond memories of the place. I had always intended to go back much sooner, but that only happened this past Thursday. 

Ehh. The shine is off. 

It wasn't bad by any means. We just left feeling quite...underwhelmed. 

Going around 4pm on a Thursday certainly has its perks, as we were only 1 of 2 parties in the entire place! So we were greeted promptly and  seated quickly. I was diggin' how the place is set up with the whole Italian thing. There was so much to check out on the walls.

They have most menu items set up as small and large. Small apparently feeds 2 people, while large will feed 4 people (or 2 really, really hungry people). We opted for some good ole lasagna and a basket of mozzarella bites. The food was just not that great. Not only that, I was really bracing myself for a good size portion and it was kind of puny for all the hype. lol

The mozzarella bites were pretty good though. we wooffed through those things before even polishing off the lasagna.

The young man who was our server was polite, friendly, and attentive. In fact everyone we came across was very nice. The issue wasn't with the service, just the lackluster food.

So, it wasn't horrible, but with so many dining options in town I honestly don't see myself going out of my way to come back here.

3 stars."}
{"text":"You do get a lot of food, but I think it is a tad pricey. I think the food is just ok, not bad, not great. If you go, you must try the colossal brownie sundea! Biggest sundea ever, and they don't skimp on the brownies either ;)"}

{"text":"Food was amazing and very filling! Enjoyed the setting, seeing all the different things on the walls was entertaining. Made for great conversation starters! I liked the create your own pasta dishes a lot and wish I could have tried the wine! I was shocked to see that this place only had three stars on Yelp..."}

Came in here for lunch because I work right down the street and was craving some pasta. The place was dead on a Monday at 12:15. Zero cars in the parking lot, and I debating even going in. Sat at the bar for 5 minutes by myself before being acknowledged with a less then friendly \"what can I get you?\"

Ummm, oh hello, thanks for the warm welcome. How about a menu? 

Ordered my pasta and wine, for her to proceed to spend ten minutes looking for the bottle, asking me if it was red, and maybe they didn't carry Malbec. I asked her for a wine list, and I'd find something different but she continued to ignore me, and looked on the computer. \"It says here we have it\"

Finally she finds the bottle, and clearly had no clue how to open it. The struggle was so real I wanted to rip the wine key out of her hand and open the damn bottle myself. 

The food wasn't bad. Wasn't the best. Big portions, but not worth going back for.

When it came time to pay, server was no where to be found. And I did laps around the restaurant trying to find her. I could have dined and dashed 3 times before a manager noticed me. 

\"Can I help you with something?\"

\"Oh you know, just trying to pay\"

\"Do you need a bag?\"

\"No, I don't.I don't even have a box, I need to leave. Please cash me out.\"

\"Let me find your sever\"

Finally server comes over with a bag..... Awesome. I don't need this now please cash me out. 

Seriously, I was one the only people in the entire place. This place has no excuse for the terrible, terrible, terribly slow service."}
{"text":"Ordered to go last night. Showed up when the emailed said it would be ready. Stood there for another 15 mins without one word said to me. When it was finally my turn the lady running the area had on way to much perfume which covered the aroma of the food. I couldn't understand what she was saying. Before I could say anything she took off into the back. I was still needed to pay and was left standing there. Finally a manager asks if I was being help and took my payment. 
By the time I got my food home ( five min drive) everything was cold. There was barely any sausage in the bake ziti. Not very happy with this experience when I have been going to same location since I was a kid with my family."}
{"text":"Food is great and served in very large portions so I would definitely recommend coming here if you want a fun family dinner night. livingsocial.com gave me a 20% off coupon for free so I saved $8 on my meal."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, ask for the house bread, they didn't have any \"sold out\", drinks took forever, Food had no flavors and is extremely expensive ,I have to go to Mc Donald's to get my own ranch,then they bring the plates so we can start having our appetizer, and got a dirty plate, when I ask the bus boy working on the table next to my table, for a clean plate he even made jokes to the fact we got a dirty plate??  I would never go again and  I know now if i ever have the craving for pasta again, just call any  other \"carry out pizza\" and get the chicken  Alfredo Im sure any other place can make better pasta than this place"}
{"text":"As long as you guide your wait staff and tell them exactly how you want your meal, all should be a -OK! :)) I did. Both times I was there and both times, left exceedingly happy and satisfied. First, I didn't know the need to be so specific, I counted on the fact that they would probably know as it was an authentic italian restaurant but turned out not quite the case. My pasta came quite overcooked. Really saggy. I wasn't a happy camper but I thought to myself that probably was all I could get in Pittsburgh. Until the waitress asked what was wrong (I must have had an expression on my face! LOL!!) , told her and she insisted that she took it back and bring me a new portion \"al dente\" as it should have been in the first place. Then she brought me a heavenly plate of goodness. I asked for extra tomato sauce that also was generously accompanied. Linguini al dente, in red sauce with shrimps. Grated parmesan as much as you want, salt and pepper and a mixed green salad with hot pickled jalapeño peppers..I couldn't be happier. I will make very unusual comment here: the fresh pepper that is left in the grinder at your table and sea salt also in the grinder..are really exceptionally good!! So fresh, so potent flavors..Service is great. Portions are huge, definitely for sharing, family style. Well, yes, shrimps also were a little overcooked but I will overlook that, if you indulge me!! :) Definitely not good for your waist line. If you want to indulge in the freezing cold weather and don't mind to leave with a full huge belly..go to Buca di Beppo.. Your wallet and all your taste buds will LOVE you!! :))"}
{"text":"I was craving for Italian food the other day and what's better version of Italian than having a perfectly good spaghetti. This food has been my most favorite since my sis in law always took me to this place and order the linguine de mare (seafood spaghetti that has the black mussels, clams, squids, and delicious spicy marinara sauce). It's the bomb! So I went there and order one along with black mussels. The place was really crowded on Friday nights and there's a lot of people having birthdays so we got waiters and waitress singing and clapping for birthdays songs the whole night. The free appetizer comes, bread with olive oil and vinegars. I tried to ask for butter but my waiter was kinda forgetting my request cause the poor waiter had to take order and sing the birthday songs in three tables. And finally the black mussels was arrived and its totally become my favorite food of the day. The sweetness and freshness of the mussels along with white wine, garlic and butter just gave the superb flavor away. I immediately felt in love with this food. Finally after the appetizer was gone and the black mussels too we waited again for 20 minutes until our spaghetti is coming and we already full cause of the long waiting and the appetizer. Luckily the taste of the spaghetti was still great so i don't regret my decision to wait in this place. Overall I learned my lessons to have carry out anytime I'm cracking that black mussels and seafood spaghetti."}
{"text":"First time coming here. We had 6 people and two kids, celebrating a birthday. Our server, Tommy, didn't refill drinks without us asking three times. We timed how often her came to our table- approximate 20 minute intervals. He forgot one of the meals. We spoke to the manager who said he was going to take off $50 worth of items, only did $33 and said, \"I never said that, I don't remember that.\" Well, Tommy said those same words with our orders and drinks... Never coming back. Waste of time and money coming here."}
{"text":"Maria...host, rolled her eyes and seemed to have a attitude problem
Kyahl?  Sounds like Kyle. was actually pretty good, he answered my mother in law's questions to the best of his abilities.
The food is always kind of hit or miss...the veal parm was good but the macaroni rosa was very bland and the broccoli in it weren't cooked and the pasta was a more al dente than we are use too...there was still a crunch"}
{"text":"My husband and I were very disappointed!  First off we walked in and it was extremely cold...I guess they want you to move on and not get to comfortable.  For a restaurant that advertises Family Style...this is hardly a family friendly restaurant...  The pictures all over the walls are extremely suggestive.  Women with deep cleavage, naked comics, a woman with huge watermelon halves held in front of her chest.  I would NOT bring my children to a place like this.   We were very hungry...so the cheese garlic bread was...well...food.  It was marginal, but better when I dipped it in marinara sauce that I later requested.  The $10 broccoli was practically raw...too crunchy and not very good.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was the worst.  Noodles over cooked and flavorless.  I found myself putting salt and pepper on for some flavor, then mixing in marinara and my husband poured a ton of Parmesan cheese on his as well. It never really tasted good...but we were hungry...which makes it worse because you eat it anyway.  The Prosciutto Chicken was delicious, but the portion was small for $24.  Service was marginal as well.  All in all...I couldn't wait to get out of there.  We spent over $60 for an all over bad experience.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Buca. I've been to this location before and loved it the last time. However, I've never been there for lunch before. They tell you that they downsize the entrees for the lunch specials. That's a lie. They still bring you a full-sized dish. If you've ever been to Buca, you know that a full-sized dish is perfect for two people.

I had soup, salad, and a side of spicy sausage in a marinara sauce. Super delicious and very filling. If i wasn't trying to be good, I would've tore up some rigatoni or baked lasagna. I went with a party of 8 and it was terribly tempting. Everything smelled delicious and I heard nothing but good things about the taste. 

I was surprised by the prices as well. I would recommend splitting a \"Buca small\" entree with someone. Cheaper, and you'll still have enough to chow. Perfect for a lunch out with your co-workers. The only downfall was the timing. An hour long lunch turned into a 1.5 hour long lunch. The size of the group was a factor, I believe. If I go back for a lunch, it will be for a lunch on the weekend sometime."}
{"text":"My wife and I met another couple with a young child for dinner. We ordered a small Works pizza which was excellent. In addition we had the chicken parmasean which was average and the ravioli with meat sauce which is on my \"no fly list\", but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. 

The problem with family style restaurants is that you tend to over order and spend way too much. I would give the Food 4 stars, the Price 3 stars and the Service 3 stars. Our meal with tip was $106 or $26.50 per adult (the child didn't really eat anything). I would only recommend going to Buca if you were in a group of 8 people or more so that everyone's cravings can be satisfied instead of having approximately 6 servings per dish and finding out that only one or two people in your party enjoy that particular dish."}
{"text":"I love the food at this chain.  They have HUGE portions here, which is great.  

Heres why the bad rating.  Service
We were greeted several minutes after sitting down and the server seemed to not really care a whole lot about doing his job.  After getting drinks, he asked about an appetizer, which we ordered.  About 10 minutes later we placed the order for the food and waiting another 15 minutes before asking what happened to the appetizer.  \"Whoops, I goofed\" was the response we got about why we had not gotten this yet, since he never rang it in.  He said he would do that right away, which we cancelled since the food should be there shortly.  
Found out, he forgot to put the order in for that too, so after 40 min from ordering the appetizer, we got the food.
The server was hardly seen the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas last weekend for my brother in law's graduation. My in-laws had planned a dinner for all of us at Bucca not knowing that I recently went on a paleo diet for health reasons. For those of you unfamiliar with paleo, it's no wheat/gluten, no dairy, no added sugars, all natural, etc.... You can imagine the anxiety I had going to a full on Italian restaurant! We had a party of 20 and the dishes were already ordered ahead of time. I told our waiter my situation. I believe his name was Ian... I let him know that I could eat meat, fruit, vegetables but not to stress over it, I could pick and choose. He literally brought me my own salad (no cheese, dressing, or croutons), then made me my own plate of grilled chicken (which he told
Me they specially made for me without flour), grilled vegetables, and when they brought out desserts (which I admit I still had a couple of bites of regardless) he brought me a beautiful bowl of fresh fruit. This accommodating, flexible, friendly caring but staff deserves way more than 5 stars. I am so appreciative of their service!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to Bucca in the past several months and i feel i have to share a review. Same exact experience both times as far as service. Went on Sunday at around 6pm. Every other restaurant around Bucca had a wait, not a long one (Cheesecake factory was 30 min) but it looks like people are starting to avoid this place. When we walked in there was nobody waiting and there was barely any tables taken. I didn't understand why i had to wait a couple minutes to be seated, but hey I'm not a hostess and I don't have the scoop on the availability of waiters on a weekend during dinner hour in one of the busiest areas of the west valley. Once me and my girlfriend got seated we waited approximately 15 minutes to receive our drinks followed by another 5-10 min for bread. Our order was fairly easy today (small pizza, small order of fettuccine alfredo). We got our meal about 20 minutes after ordering, which is fairly reasonable and i was happy about that. But, the fettuccine was cold and you could clearly tell our waitress forgot since someone else had to bring it to us. We ate our meal and decided to save most of it for left overs. Then, this is where the turn happened. Once done we pushed our plates away and waited for our waitress to come back so that we could order desert and get to go containers. After 30 minutes we finally see her and she went straight to a table that had just been seated took their order and walked away. All while i waived to flag her down and said \"excuse me miss\" she walked away. I saw to go containers in the waiter station next to me and took the liberty of grabbing them to box myself. It wasn't until she brought the other tables food back that we finally saw her and asked for the check, which took about another 10 minutes to do.

Basically, if you have alot of time on your hands and have nothing else better to do than this is the place for you. I really enjoy the food here, however the service you have to deal with is mediocre at best. They pay no attention and i received the same exact service 2-3 months ago. I even sat in the same booth. It could be just the area of the restaurant we get stuck in but after two times i'm skeptical. I want to go back and give this place another shot but part of me doesn't want to waste my money.

I would highly advise just ordering to go instead of putting up with their staff, because the pizza is very good. 2 stars for the pizza."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place.  Been there a few times and I would recommend it to anyone.  Great food great atmosphere.  Of you are having 8-10 people ask for \"The Pope Room\"."}
{"text":"What's not to love?  Really great food served family-style with attentive service, a great atmosphere and all of those pictures to look at, to boot!  

We always get the mozzarella garlic bread, the 1893 salad, chicken Parmesan, spaghetti and meatballs, and another dish which today was the baked stuffed shells. Everything was top notch!"}
{"text":"I don't really like giving chains 5-stars but I think Buca deserves it for several reasons.  First off the servings are huge, which allows you to order a few things for the table and have your party pick a large variety of tastes.  

Second- the price point is not bad for the amount of food you get with entrees ranging in the $15-$30 range (depending on serving size).  if you sign up for their e-mail club or coupon clip you'll see a $10 off purchase of $20 or more.  Get a small pasta and two drinks and you've got yourself a very reasonable date!

Lastly the food is very good.  Maybe they don't have the bread sticks or salad like Olive Garden, but the dishes themselves are very good.  As you'll see with my other reviews of Italian places, I use Buca as my \"base-line\" to compare other maybe fancier places."}
{"text":"The food at Buca had always been good and it's a great place for parties. That being said, the only thing good about our latest visit there was the food. Our server was rude and barely tended to us. We were celebrating a birthday and paid the $15 charge to bring our own cake. Apparently if you bring your own cake they will make you pay the fee but not bring out plates, forks, or sing to you? Very disappointed in the fact that the birthday girl had to wander around and grab plates off of other tables because our server was no where to be found and then watch another table get sung the birthday song...we must have gotten skipped? Very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"My parents, sister and I ate here for lunch today. I don't really have any complaints about the food, but the layout of this place is very strange. We were seated on the first floor. To get to the restrooms, you either have to take the stairs (or the elevator) to the second floor and walk through the kitchen. I have never seen that before.

I have also noticed the cleanliness standards are lacking in this place. It smells mildewy and that needs to be addressed.

I would be willing to give them a second chance and try one of their other locations, but not this one.

{"text":"Italian atmosphere.  Always seems busy with kong wait times to be expected.  Portions are real big so might want to think about sharing.  Their beer selection is terrible unless your favorite beer is bud light.  Food is ok quality pizza is pretty good.  I give it 3.5 stars. If going on weekend night be prepared to wait at least a half hour."}
{"text":"Loved coming here the food was very delicious and our server was very friendly and full of an energy love the setup of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Good food, but very slow service and extremely overpriced for a bowl of pasta, bowl of iceberg lettuce, eggplant parm and 2 beers each, for 2. Over $100!! I could easily made it for much less and fed 8."}
{"text":"Sitting here now as we speak, sat for several minutes watching others who were sat after us get served. Wasn't about to deal with this a second time within the past couple months so i went down n said something. 
Bread only if requested, came out cold.  Zero offer of olive oil or butter included. Someone brought plates and literally ran off after. Still waiting for my drinks.. 
We shall see how the rest unfolds... i dont imagine it will be too well. It's a slow Monday night as we sit in the corner upstairs forgotten again. Only reason i come back is because of the coupons they keep emailing me. 
Totally ridiculous, last visit was extremely similar."}

Love the atmosphere and food definitely  will be my go to restaurant everytime we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"I think the rating this restaurant currently has (3 stars) completely fits the experience that my family and I had. The food at this restaurant is always good. (Except for the calamari, it was TERRIBLE. Chewy, overcooked, and just bad) The family style, flavors, and overall food quality was solid. 
I think the one thing holding this place back is the service. I've never come here and felt my service was good. It's always been just mehhh. We waited forever for our drinks because our server said she keeps running over to bar and they're not ready yet. They should consider a bar runner, for such a large, yet busy restaurant.
Overall, I'll be back. Because the food here is always consistent. I just wish that they changed up their servers and had a little bit more front of the house management."}
{"text":"We were excited to be in town; my wife's brother was getting married. The rehearsal dinner was held at Buca di Beppo. I was prepared to enjoy a delicious, Italian dinner. I tried to pace myself, knowing that there were probably going to be many courses.

Throughout the night, two servers were on the ball and granted all of our requests. They were friendly and helpful (especially considering there were many kids in our group, including mine).

I was a fan of the very first course, a delicious caprese salad. It's so simple, yet so elegant. I love that it represents the colors of the Italian flag. Yes, I'm corny like that.

The second and third courses were salads that I wasn't particularly interested in. They were good, but not really my thing. 

The fourth course was fried calamari, and it was delicious. The marinara that accompanied it was stellar, and I of course squeezed fresh lemon over the top. I was already thinking about trying to save room for the entire meal. I knew that they were going to go all-out (after all, you only get married once [in theory]).

The next course was a spicy chicken pasta. The pasta sauce was good, as well as the chicken (although some people thought it was too spicy). I liked it.

Course number six was a shrimp pasta. It was quite good. There was a lot of savory shrimp inside, and the sauce was tasty.

Everyone began rubbing their tummies, feeling full, and anticipating dessert. That's when the groom-to-be stood up and announced, \"I hope you all saved room for the main course.\" A lot of us laughed, but he wasn't kidding! Oh man, I ate too much already. But bring it on, they're only getting married once, right?

Out comes huge family style plates of chicken parmesan (I've lost track of the course numbers by now). I dove right in to discover it was well-breaded, seasoned, and delicious. I was really feeling full at this point when the chicken with capers arrived. It was moist, tender, and had a flavorful sauce.

Next, some succulent, well buttered broccoli arrived. I made myself eat some (we need our veggies).

Everyone was doing their best to continue eating when enormous trays of meatballs in marinara sauce made their appearance. Needless to say, no one left hungry.

At last, we had made it to dessert (most of us barely being able to move). Huge trays of cheesecake surfaced, as did tiramisu. It's safe to say we all gained a few pounds that night. Overall, it was a large, enjoyable meal. Congrats to the bride and groom!"}
{"text":"Really crappy pasta. The chicken was just thrown into the pasta with no flavor. The order was chicken Alfredo and it was bad. Never again."}
{"text":"I have gone there a few times myself and the owners and people they hire are absolute douche bags.  The rude behavior and attitude that comes with just there hostess stand looks like it translates all the way back to the kitchen.  So much, I was mentioning it to staff at nearby restaraunts to learn that it looks like this place is on the way out the door because they do not respect union agreed upon rules and treat their employees so badly there are a ton of grievances stacked against them.  (Allegedly)  So, keep reviewing, cause it is supporting the employees who work there trying to make a living! And being treated less than."}
{"text":"Never going here again. HORRIBLE! 
I took my boyfriend for dinner here for his birthday because it was his first time. First of all our waitress Bree looked like she was on 10 cups of coffee, and secondly the family right behind us were really upset because Bree lost their credit card which was what they payed for I'm assuming. Ugh who loses a credit card!?!? Ok so now to our issues, well we both asked for waters and she asked \"with lemon\" we both said yes she' comes back with 2 water one with lemon and one without lemon she's said \" oh I forgot I didn't know if u wanted it with lemon or not\" so I said it's ok no worries, then while my boyfriend was not looking I told her it's my boyfriends birthday today she's winked back and said \" ok got it\" as were having our dinner she boxes up our food and Says \"any dessert for tonight\" I said yes \"plain cheesecake\" she's said \"I'll bring that right out for you\" as I waited and waited and WAITED they never came and sang happy birthday to my boyfriend and she brought us our tab and I said uhhh did u forget our cheesecake she's said\" oh yea I'll bring it right up\" This was really upsetting due to the fact that it was my boyfriends birthday, she DID not deserve our tip she was a horrible waitress. Were never going back to this bucca de beppo. Flamingo location is way better. *Thumbs down*"}
{"text":"This was our first night in LV after 20 hours of travelling and wanted somewhere within easy reach of our hotel for dinner. Buca di Beppo is inside the Excalibur Hotel complex and offers 'family sized' Italian meals - that means for us Brits that the portions are big. We had the large Pepperoni which was too big for three of us with a few slices remaining on the board. The pizza was thin crust and the pepperoni was quite tasty but the tomato sauce was a bit insipid.

Drinks are on permanent happy hour so we could get a Light Beer for just $3 a glass. 

There was a little issue with initially getting served but this was due to the bar area only being covered by one person at 8:30pm. When we were served though the guy was great and looked after us really well, making recommendations to save money.

Bearing in mind it's inside a hotel it's a good bargain and acceptable for a quick snack."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We waited over 10 mins to be acknowledged.Only to wait another 10 for our server to come back and take our order.Then waited forever for our food.We got our food and started to eat our server never came back to check on us. As we ate he clocked out and walked right in from of us. NO one came to check on us!! I asked to see the Manager on duty which took 5 mins which was a waste of my time. For the money we paid was not worth a penny."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by all of the low ratings! Until I started reading them, and most of the negative is based on their service! We also have a problem with the service! The Family! Only came here because another restaurant next door was going to be a long wait. So, while we were walking back to our truck. Daughter mentioned, lets try Buca! Since non of us have ever ate here, and we always like to try something new. We decided to try Buca!!!!! Now this was a totally different experience. When we first walked in, we noticed all of the pictures hanging up. If you have little ones, you might have to explain a few things to them about some of the pictures! We were met by a couple of hostesses, after a few seconds of trying to determine where they want to seat us. One finally grabbed a few menu's and introduced herself to us. After a little tour through the kitchen, and surprisingly noticed they also have a table for customers in the kitchen! We were seated up stairs! Kind of feel sorry for them going up and down the stairs all day. Especially the food servers!! We were warned about the servings, since a small feeds two-three. Now this rating is based on three things!
1) Service! 
Not very good! There were times we were waiting for our waiter. We received our salad before our appetizer! For the price of our bill, service needs to get better 
2-STARS
2) Taste!
We ordered and expected to bring home left overs! Pepperoni Pizza, Actually I loved this pizza! One of the best! Next time I will asked them to cook it well done, for that crispier crust. We also had their chicken Parmesan, Daughter loved this one, Mommy and myself agreed with her also! Then the girls of course wanted a cheese cake, this was also very good. 4-STARS
3) Price!
Now, when you come here. You are going to spend some money. Just the three of us, our bill was over one hundred dollars!! I don't mind laying down a hundred for a meal. But the service needs to be better. 2-STARS

Overall we had a great time, and we will be coming back."}

{"text":"I was in the mood for garlic bread and fettuccine, so I went online and googled places to eat in vegas for italian food. Of course the hotel strip restaurants pop up first, but in a 10 best website, Bucca di Beppo was listed for Vegas as an off strip Italian place serving fantastic food.

I had to try it.

About 3 miles away from my apartment there is one, nestled in a corner with a bright neon sign that shows even in daylight. You pull up, expecting parking to be in front of the door, but theirs is located behind the building--meaning a walk to the entrance. I didn't understand why at first, but keep reading.

We walk in and the first thing that will catch anyone's attention are the photos on the wall. There are literally hundreds depicting families, individuals, animals, holidays, sports--you name it, it's on the wall. The setting is classic Italian restaurant--the red cloth and the best part was the menus, which are the placemats. I love the convenience of it in case you want to order more. We decided on two classics--lasagna and fettucine alfredo. Since we arrived at lunchtime, we received free garlic bread with cheese. Their garlic bread is to DIE for, with real thin slices of garlic and fresh oregano and basil. It's fantastic and we ate two basketfuls before our appetizer showed up. We had their stuffed mushroom with proscuitto and mozzarella--a must try. It was creamy, salty sweet, and the bed of pesto cream sauce was incredible. After we devoured the sauce and mushrooms, our main courses came out.

If you've never been here, there are three ways to order: small, large, or \"mio\" which are individual portions for lunch. If there are two of you eating, try getting the mio sizes, because my boyfriend and I assumed that small would be just right, and we were dead wrong. For the price you pay, the portions are incredibly large. Their pasta and lasagna are beautifully presented on traditional plates, family style. At first I was hesitant to cut into anything because it looked so pretty. After taking a picture, we cut small slices of the nine layer lasagna and took a large portion of pasta each. From the small order of lasagna, we had more than half of it left over, and the small slice we did eat was an honest meal in itself! The waitress even asked us if we touched our pasta--that's how much you get.

As for taste, it's divine. Not only was the alfredo sauce creamy, thick, and decadent, but the pasta was cooked perfectly. As for the lasagna--if you are a lasagna person, this place is it! Thick noodles, layers of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and a tomato sauce that is to die for! It's sweet but balances with enough acidity, and the chunks of tomato in there are so good to just scoop and eat alone. We also ordered a 1/2 pound meatball, and I assumed that the sauce would be the same sauce as the lasagna. It's not. They have sauces for each specific dish and the meatball sauce was heaven! The meatball itself was so good that it was devoured in a minute, literally.

They gave us a free gelato cone which is small but after a meal like that, quite enough! I reccommend trying their pistachio and triple berry. It's yummy! For a price ticket of 60 dollars, this place is not only quite affordable for a party of four (yes that price is ordering food for 4-6 people), but for two people on a romantic date. I highly reccommend that you stop here and eat some great food if you haven't yet. It's worth every penny and definitely every bite."}
{"text":"We made a trip out to Vegas for Thanksgiving and conveniently were staying in the Excalibur hotel. This is conveniently within the hotel which was really nice. We booked a Thanksgiving reservation ahead although, it wasn't needed. We showed up at 1:30 and there were maybe 2 other families in the entire restaurant. The wait staff were really great! Very friendly and super fast service. We had a traditional Thanksgiving meal for 3. We are a family of 4 and decided to order a side of pasta as well. This was VERY much unnecessary. The portions were huge!!! Even with 4 of us we took a ton of leftovers. It all turned out really delicious! We love Buca di Beppo's anyway. But they were on point for a Thanksgiving meal as well! Highly recommended. Great experience!"}

She was running from table to table. She gave us oil and balsamic, took at least another 15min  the bread to come.  Im the one getting up for extra plates, oil and balsamic vinegar. It was very annoying. Such a long wait. Will never go back again..."}
{"text":"Average Italian food. Nothing really spectacular. I had the lasagna. Was fairly bland. They had to replace the first piece I got due to there being a piece of what looked like plastic wrap in it."}
{"text":"First of all the scenery was exceptional, prime choice of artwork. The seating choice wasn't too good would've like to of seated a much larger table but not complaining about it too much. But the reception was phenomenal felt welcomed and comfortable, also customer service was excellent waiter was on point with refills, except the time my home boi Jake asked for one and got a flat Pepsi. Although the pepperoni pizza was too thin for my liking it was pleasing and well cooked and satisfied it's a bit over prized for the quality. Overall fantastic place to grub with friends and family"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time and money on this restaurant. If you are hungry for large portions of cheap pasta, go to Olive Garden  or some local restaurant instead. The restaurant was very run down, a bit dirty, and smelled unpleasant inside. It also seemed a bit like a stuffy, dark basement with a lot of junk on the walls (yes I know this is supposed to be part of the theme). The food is served as large portions meant to be shared, and might be an ok deal for larger groups, but it was not a good deal for 2. We ended up spending almost $90 for one shared pasta dish, one shared salad, and two large beers. We ordered one of the pasta specials (short rib orecchiette) and it was OK, but definitely not worth the price. The server was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit with friends. Warm atmosphere with stereotypical Italian pictures of mobsters and celebrities. Service is always good and food portions are plentiful. Have yet the have anything on the menu that I didn't like. Great fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"We went on Mother's Day, to the location in Summerlin. We reserved ahead of time which I recommend. Very noisy, but it was a holiday! Big portions served family style, pretty basic Italian offerings. We did get the Brownie Sundae for dessert and it is huge! Really, the 4 of us -3 adults and a teen- couldn't finish it. The waitress was friendly and attentive, the decor is fun. A good place for a family celebration but probably not a great choice for a date!"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I have been here multiple times and it's good. The pizzas, pastas, salads, and desserts are good! I highly recommend the baked Ziti! The staff is friendly and helpful. The waiting room is very limited in space and can be frustrating. The dining space can feel small due to the dark depressing colors and the clutter all over the walls. Prices are a little high and portions are enormous. I can have enough left over food to last two days after the visit. Overall it is an ok place."}
{"text":"My family loves Buca and we often go for our Italian fix. This location was probably our worst experience. 1. The smoking benches with ashtray are right in front of the entrance. You end up inhaling a whiff of smoke as you walk in, and even the lobby smells like smoke. 2. The food took forever to come out. 3. The food was bad. We ordered the chicken rigatoni and a veggie pizza. I asked for the rigatoni to be cooked al dente but it was overcooked and bland. The pizza barely had any veggies on it and there was way too much cheese. The edges just looked like a cheese pizza. Our waitress was very nice and I'm sure it's not her fault that they were under staffed and the chef can't cook. We won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I had my baby shower and her baptism here I love the ravioli and the pasta with broccoli and chicken pesto. The service was great as usual. Jackie was our server for the shower and baptism she was awesome. Karen P."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, it was super slow which should have been a sign. Got seated after waiting a bit, it was clear it was rookie night.  Waited about 7 minutes, no server came. Finally walked up to the bar and got drinks, then listened to the server and bartender bicker about whose table we were. The server even came up and apologized, but proclaimed she wasn't our server. Five more minutes, still no one to take our order, so we left. Horrible service, wish I could review the food but never got the chance. Went next door to Texas Roadhouse and had a great meal with excellent service."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Clearly hand crafted while you wait. But seriously, there should be a small, medium and large option. The \"small\" portion could feed 4 easily. It's impossible for one or two people to dine here unless they order one item and there's still a ton left over. I would love to come back but only with a larger group."}
{"text":"Buca Di Beppo is a chain restaurant and for that I dock a star, but they do have great Itailian food.

Everything is family style so dont be surprised when the prices look high, almost every portion serves between 2 and 5 people.  I went on a business dinner with 8 of us and service was great.  Since they are used to handling big groups of people, our orders were nothing new.  Nice to be able to have a good meal with lots of people and finally not complain about the service.

Decent wine selection, tasty desserts and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very strange experience.  When we came in the manager embarrassed my 12 year old daughter by asking her why she had never been there before.  I'm mad at myself for not saying that all of our friends said that it was not very good and then walking out.

My wife thought that the kitchen tour was weird.

Finally got seated.  Service was poor and the food was worse.  Apparently they think that anything can be turned into Italian food by putting shaved garlic on it."}
{"text":"Had the spicy chicken rigatoni, and it was delicious.  The sauce to pasta ratio was too high, so if we lived in the area, we'd have taken the leftovers and could have eaten two more meals by adding some extra pasta.

The service was terrible.  We ate here the night before running the Pittsburgh half marathon.  The place was busy, but there were a few empty tables around us.  Our waitress took at least 20 minutes to do everything.  Twenty minutes before our order was taken, 20 more minutes before we got our drinks.  Half an hour to bring us dessert, and yet another 20 minutes to get our check, and almost half an hour to take our credit card.  We were at the table for over 2.5 hours.  She was almost never in the room, so we're not sure what she was doing, but it was some of the worst service we've had in quite some time."}
{"text":"We went there after worship service on Sunday and everything was just so fresh and tasty.
I like this place just as much as I like Magiano's.  Italian food is my favorite and they did not disappoint me at all.  It was really good and so was the service.
I will be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"This place is so tasty! The service is so awesome & I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys delicious Italian food."}
{"text":"There isn't a whole lot I can write about Buca that hasn't been said before.  The theming is cute, family style can be fun or not depending on if you can all get along in your choices and the food is pretty generic.  There is nothing here that will knock your socks off but it surely isn't the worst food you can have either.  I feel bad that I don't have a whole lot to say about this place but it's a chain and it's all been said before."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night with my sister and her boyfriend and it was awesome! The Baked Rigatoni was on point! Perfect amount of cheese, sauce, everything! Service and staff was super friendly as well! Portion sizes were perfect!

Perfect place for groups and great food!"}
{"text":"Two and a half stars, neither A-ok nor real bad. 
I was at Carolina Place around 1:30 pm and decided to give this restaurant a try -I was told it's the best Eyetalian in Charlotte.

First the good part: I ordered the baked rigatoni with meat sauce and hot Italian sausage. It was excellent -if like me you like strong flavors and spicy both- nothing I'd expect from a chain restaurant. The lunch portion was huge, too much in fact.
that's it for the good.

Service was absolutely dismal for no good reason. It was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch. I think the dinner prices are very high for Southern Italian style pasta dishes, especially considering we're in Charlotte and I think their idea of \"family dining\" makes life easier for the cook but does nothing for the customer. 

My idea of fun dining is exactly the opposite, I want to taste as many different things I can, not pig out on a mound of carbs."}
{"text":"We went to Buca on a Monday night, it's a favorite restaurant for both of us. I have never had worse service anywhere. Our waiter got a bigger table and pretty much ignored us. He never brought us bread, he didn't even bring out our food. When the food did come out, the waiter almost dropped both of them until another waitress helped him and then slammed the plate down on top of my phone and wallet, with no apology, and walked away. We still hadn't gotten the refill and water we asked for at this point. Our original waiter decided to make an appearance and my boyfriend asked him to finally bring us our bread that we should have gotten 45 minutes earlier. We asked for the check and he forgot to apply the $10 discount for the coupon I had given him. Then when he came back to box up our leftovers, he dropped the entire plate on the table, shattering my wine glass and pasta flew all over the place. He was very apologetic, and then brought out our check again. After horrible service and shattering a wine glass and having pasta spill all over, he didn't even comp us the $2 side of Alfredo sauce my boyfriend asked for. Absolutely ridiculous.

UPDATE:

After reading this review, I was contacted by the manager and received THE BEST customer service ever. Craig was extremely apologetic and just an overall sweetheart. He offered to send us something in the mail for our next visit to Buca and we accepted. The next time we're in Vegas, we will be giving this Buca another shot, just because of how awesome Craig was. Thank you Craig for your great customer service!!"}
{"text":"So for a first timer, it was cool how they directed us towards the kitchen into the back. Decorations were pretty cool as well, especially all the old to new wine bottles on the ceiling. I expected more for taste, and presentation on the food. It was good, but I like \"cheesecake factory\", and \"olive gardens\" pastas alot more for prices, and quality! As for service, our waittress only refilled our drinks once, and was hardly around for us to ask for anything. We had to wait 30mins while eating for napkins that were never provided before our meals, and refills. Poor service for me and my wifes first experience, and it was our 1yr marriage anniversary!!! Im not writing this review angry, as this is the truth of my honest experience. If its anything we look towards in any restaurant like any other person out there, its \"Quality\", and \"Service\". Unfortunately that night didnt fall under that category. Its my last experience for this place. I recommend everyone to go to \"cheescake factory\", or \"olive garden\". Better tasting food, price is right, and services are better provided."}
{"text":"As a family we have always loved Buca Di Beppo at any location. The food is great, the service has always been excellent, however, the wait time for food delivery and the final bill, keeps us remembering why we come and will we return.   Over all the experience of Buca Di Beppo is wonderful !! We love the family style dining and have made reservations for years for all occasions. The price isn't bad for what you receive as well as discounts and coupons are everywhere if you look for them. 

I know with all this being said we as a family will return."}
{"text":"Lunch was Wonderful ! The food was delicious as always!  We like the Buca in Station Square, out in Robinson it seemed to be the best place for lunch. We were not disappointed. 
Service was friendly and quick to take our order and accommodating to our needs. 
The kitchen was quick in preparing our order. 
I just LOVE the Chicken Carbonara and order it every time. Small family size so complement other pasta dishes we want to try. 
I love the wine bottles decorating the ceiling, decorative and function able as well. 
Highly recommended !!"}
{"text":"Go hungry

Buca di Beppo is an old fashioned Italian style restaurant with a relaxed and homey feel.  This was my first visit to this Buca Di Beppo location and I have to admit I was a little disappointed.  

On my first visit I decided to take advantage of the  take out service  rather then eating at the restruant. The small portions at Bucca  Di Beppo  are enough for at least two people if not three, so be guided accordingly. For large families, the pasta dishes looked like they would feed quite a few people, however, I tend to look for quality, not quantity.

On this visit I ordered the baked rigatoni, chicken Parmesan , mini meatballs, mozzarella garlic bread, and chocolate covered cannolis.  The meatballs were delicious, however the rest of the meal was average at best. The bread, pasta, and chicken dishes were soggy and not seasoned very well, maybe it's something you have to eat at the restaurant.  It just wasn't very good.  The Cannolis were okay, nothing special.  I guess I was expecting more.  It was disappointing at best, especially after spending 72+ dollars.


I might give Bucca Di Beppo another try at some point."}
{"text":"It's very average all the way around for this Bucca. With all of the amazing dining options available in Old Town I'm surprised it's still at this location. Even though I live within walking distance, today was the first time I've given it a shot because I was in the mood for some Italian food and it was the only place open at 11. All three dishes my family ordered were average, not horrible, but not exceptional in any way. The one nice attribute that this location has is the patio that looks over Scottsdale road. I can't really recommend it for anyone looking for Italian in old town."}
{"text":"Big portions.  Be prepared to share.

We had the lasagna & the chopped antipasto salad... both were delicious.  The lasagna was freshly baked (the plate was about a thousand degrees) & stuffed with cheese.  Left me wanting more meat though.  The salad was everything I want an antipasto to be-- just the right amount of cheeses, meats & veggies. Ordered smalls & the two of us definitely left full.  Our total with a glass of wine & a beer was about $50.

Good place to celebrate a special occasion-- there is plenty of room for big parties.

For a chain restaurant, they're doing it right."}
{"text":"While the service was good the food was not. shrimp scampi  was bland. They did not have any salad available and they ran out of lemonade. I keep giving this place a chance but it continuously disappoints."}
{"text":"They are located inside the Excalibur.  We stopped in for lunch and WOW it was THE BEST Italian food I have ever eaten! We ordered the thin crust pizza with everything and it was outta this world good.  They brought us warm bread while we were waiting for the food to arrive, which was also good and we both walked away stuffed.  It was a little pricey but worth it in my opinion. My only regret was not being able to go back and try some other dishes before we left but will be going back to Vegas in a couple of months and cant wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the drinks, food and service. Victor was our waiter he was friendly and helpfull.. The food portion size was more that enough left overs... I got the fettuchini and my husband got the lasagna..yumm."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo is so over rated! I don't understand why anyone would come here for Italian food. It just screams typical chain restaurant and I could easily make this kind of pasta at home myself (and I don't cook much, especially Italian).  

I came here with a large group of people for a birthday party and I will say that we had very good service, especially being a group of about 25 people, they were very accommodating and nice. Our waitress was so friendly, even after a couple of complaints from people about cold food and such, we had great service. 

But my table ordered chicken parmesan and a spicy red pepper chicken pasta and we were less than pleased with the food. The pasta was tasteless and contained very little chicken, like maybe a few pieces sprinkled throughout the large sized dish. The chicken parmesan was way too breaded, and also lacked flavor. I would not order either of those dishes again. The salad was pretty good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo, what an odd little Italian restaurant. In all honesty it was our last resort. My sister and I drove past to get a feel for the place when we saw a neon sign saying \"Health Inspected\". This was disturbing. It made me think that maybe this place had been shut down before for health code violations. Why else would one feel the need to make such a statement? But we were hungry and our options were limited so we went in.  We were greeted by an overly enthusiastic brunette who led us on a journey through the kitchen to our table. I have to admit that part was pretty neat. You can actually watch the chef cook the food if you want. 
The atmosphere in the restaurant was incredible. There were so many randomly strange pictures covering practically every inch of the walls. In the far back of the room a picture of the pope, on the ceiling that one skinny Italian guy from the Sopranos, and so many little statues everywhere the restaurant was very unique, I enjoyed it very much.
 The food looked so mouth watering when our waitress brought our meals straight from the oven to our table. I took a bite of my Chicken Cannelloni, the noodle was tender, the mottzy spinach medley was stringy melty goodness, the rosa sauce was rich, a touch sweet and all around goodness. The chicken pieces however were few and far between and the chef was skimpy with the sauce. This would have been all right if I was a vegetarian but as it stands I am not and I was expecting more chicken. the raspberry Italian soda,  was tasty as well refreshing, but it tasted exactly like the Olive Garden Italian Soda. I wonder if they have the same supplier.
 All in all the experience was less than great, the service was good considering there was only one waitress for our entire section of the restaurant, the food left much to be desired, the atmosphere however was very unique and by far my favorite part of the whole meal."}
{"text":"Mixed greens salad was sloppy and slimy! For $17, I expected way more in a salad. Please, guys. Lasagna was almost $30 and only so-so! My husband and I couldn't believe we dropped $70 after tip for the crap we ate. And the waiter was cold and expressionless and never checked in on us...the place wasn't even busy! If you want to stay in business, try WAY harder, Buca! I've had better food and service at fast food restaurants! Never going back."}
{"text":"Environment is interesting albeit needing some clean up, staff is friendly and efficient!  Now for the negatives: this is definitely an Americanized Italian food place.  All the pastas were overcooked and overpriced.  The main dishes were not very flavorful, chicken was tender, seafood overcooked, sauces uninspired.  I love warm bread but the garlic mozzarella bread was almost inedible I'm sad to say.  The desert had mostly whipped cream, a little ice cream and a chunk of brownie.  Overall impression is overpriced, over cooked, under flavored.  There is no way I will be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible experience. Aaron, our waiter has no business working in the industry. He lacked any and all empathy for our food that took over TWO HOURS to be brought out. Every single table around us got their food first even though we had been seated long before them. He continued to fill up my pink lemonade cup with water and acted put out when I'd ask for another lemonade.

The manager on duty comped our entire meal. It still then took another hour for our food to be brought out. When Aaron dropped the bag at the table he stood there, clearly expecting a \"thank you\" and when he did not receive one as we simply stood up to leave, he threw his hands up and said, \"yeah. Thank you\".

We will never be returning to this location again. We very much appreciate the manager handling it, however there was zero follow up after he spoke to us and every time he walked by he avoided eye contact at all costs. Considering we were there an hour after he spoke with us, a follow up would have been nice."}
{"text":"Buca is good, just not great. Came in for a large party and they \"accidentally double booked\" the pope room. Reservations were made a month and a half in advance, yet we were the ones to lose the room. We ended up smashed in the center of one of their dining rooms and it took 20 minutes to get checks figured out after we took them back and did all the work for our server. 
I love the food, drinks are a little expensive and the service is always friendly. Again, I like the place. Just don't love it."}
{"text":"Waiter was slow and not too attentive to us even after we said we only had an hour before the movie started.  Food was average.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Buca do Beppo isn't really an Italian restaurant. It's an Italian-American restaurant which served Americanized versions of Italian dishes. The decor of the restaurant is a throwback to 1950s Italian-American kitsch with red and white checkered vinyl tablecloths on the table, Christmas lights on tacky fake marble statues, memorabilia of the popes everywhere and a photo of Mario Lanza hanging over the urinal. The food is definitely not delicate, featuring heavy breading and dried pasta that stuck together while boiling. I had the veal saltimbocca that was tasty but you couldn't distinguish that you were acting eating veal and Italian ham the breading was so heavy. My side dish of fettuccine Alfredo tasted more like over cooked box pasta with hot cream. Still, the waitress was super friendly and the overall charm of the restaurant went a long way."}
{"text":"We had reservations but were seated late due to the previous party still being at the table. The hostess was very nice and apologetic about this. While we waited for our table, other customers were being told that it would be at least an hour and a half wait. This place was not crowded, in fact as we were being seated I saw many empty tables. Our waitress was not the greatest, she was pushy and short with us. This is a family style restaurant so you can either order a large or small plate. I thought even the small plates were way overpriced and the flavor was way underwhelming. The service was very very slow. Unfortunately we were seated near the kitchen and at some point we heard a commotion that sounded like a kitchen fire. The decor was dated and busy and also filthy, I noticed inches of dust and cobwebs on their kitschy decorations. I would not willingly go back to this place, I've had way better from my own kitchen!"}
{"text":"I booked my wedding reception through Buca way back in July.  Shelby used to be my contact but I don't think that she is with Buca anymore and Trisha had taken over.
I was told that I would have the cardinal room which would hold a max of 46 guests.  I had 41.  I thought plenty of room. NO WAY! 
I had 4 people leave because there wasn't enough seating for them, mind you I paid for people that didn't eat or drink, but it's not about the money.  We were SO crammed into the room that people couldn't wait to leave.  It was hot, the service was really slow. People left hungry. it was a disaster.
Please think before you book your reception with them. I called to tell them about it and got a crazy attitude. I wish I would have known better."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good it come in large proportions and it is the best. I personally recommend the ravioli and chicken. But it is a little pricey (15-20) about per dish but each fish may serve a few people what we did was we ordered A few dishes and we all shared them. It was great service it was refills right when you where empty. It is a little chilly in the restaurant so make sure you are prepared."}
{"text":"This last time we were so disappointed with our visit. We were told they do not have any salad. Really !? Seemed hard to believe. They couldn't go to the store and buy some. We ordered a small baked pasta. It came out cold with hardly no sauce. We asked for more. The waitress gave us extra for free. The portion was smaller than what I remember. I ordered coke to drink. Every cup I received was flat. The service was still good. Just the food was not up to quality. Very disappointing this time."}
{"text":"We have been fans of Buca for a while now.  We don't usually make it to the Scottsdale location, but this time we did.  And they did not disappoint.  The carbonara  was very good, as was the supremo pizza (thin crust, slightly charred, crispy, and very flavorful sauce and toppings).  Service was reasonably good.

So far it's probably the best Italian food we've found in the Valley.  Which is amazing for a chain restaurant!  There may be some mom-and-pop place that's better, but we haven't found it yet.  This is our first choice for Italian."}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a national chain.  I still like this place.  They are a bit pricey, but nearly always one can find a good coupon.  Heck, get on their email list and you'll get one every couple of weeks.  Check out my previous reviews, they still apply.  Cluttered ambiance, extensive menu, etc.

Today was a free buca small pasta with coupon.  Limited selection, but it was a full-sized buca small (which was enough for both of us with some left to take home).

Good pasta. Big, flavorful meatballs.  Sometimes simple just hits the spot, and the spaghetti marinara with the \"side\" meatball did just that.

Service here is always friendly.

Except for pizza, this is my preferred Italian place.  The pizza here is good too, but I prefer Grimaldi's if I'm going for pizza.  I keep looking for a good mom/pop place, but have yet to find one that appealed to me.  In fact, there aren't that many around at all.  Most are chains."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for my mothers birthday and it was very delicious. I love how their portions are made for sharing family style. Prices are reasonable and service was great. One thing I did not enjoy was their red Sangria, overly sweet and I was really bummed about that. But either than that great place."}
{"text":"Wow.  It's been a looong time since I updated my review here.  Not sure how that happened!  We come here a few times a year.

Buca di Beppo is a national chain.  I generally prefer places that are not, but this is one of the exceptions.  The food here is consistently good.  Service can be a bit spotty with your server disappearing for a while.  This is most common when they are slammed, which is almost every night.  Come in at an off-time (like 2pm or 9pm) and most of the 'rush' is over and service is better.  Wait time is also less (without a reservation our wait time would have been about half an hour based on what they were telling walk-ins when we arrived).

As I mentioned in a previous review, the decor is cluttered.  It's my understanding it is supposed to resemble someone's basement.  When I had a basement it wasn't that cluttered.  Some of the imagery is a bit crude, but it doesn't really bother me.

The food is served \"family style\".  A big plate or bowl in the middle of the table, and everyone digs in.  You can order a \"small\" or a \"large\" of just about anything.  They have a good variety of dishes from traditional fare like spaghetti and lasagna, to non-pasta entrees like chicken marsala, to stuff I'm pretty sure they just made up (spicy rigatoni, etc).  Some dishes if you want pasta you have to order it as a side.

We have come here a few times in the past three weeks, so I will cover it all here.  What follows was the last few visits.  Two visits were take-out, so table service was not an issue.

We ordered a Penne San Remo.  While it's not one of my favorites, it's OK.  Our daughter loves it.  She was quite happy with it.

We also ordered a pizza.  Their pizza is good, but this did confirm for me that if I want pizza I will go to Grimaldi's.  Grimaldi's is better.  In this case the pizza was a second dish ordered because someone wanted pizza.  Our primary dish was lasagna (which I wanted!), and it was very good.  I really like their lasagna.  Their lasagna is better than the one I make, and it gives me something to shoot for when I make mine.  Maybe someday I'll beat theirs.

Sometimes you just want something simple.  We had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Their meatballs are huge.  The marinara sauce is excellent.  When you have the craving this one hits the spot.  Yes, I can make this at home but mine is different.  

The spinach and sausage ziti was new to us.  The first bite was not impressive for some reason, but by the time I finished my portion I liked it.  I wouldn't say it was their best offering, but it was good.

And last night we had the Penne al Forno.  That was surprisingly good with the prosciutto, pepperoni, and Italian sausage.  I may have a new favorite baked pasta dish.

They have endless bread service.  The usual way to eat it is to combine olive oil and balsalmic vinegar in a bowl and dip the bread.  My wife likes to add pepper and Parmesan also.  The oil will separate from the vinegar which works for me because I don't care for the vinegar.  So I dip away from where the vinegar has pooled.  The bread itself is just an Italian bread.  Not really much different than the baguettes you could buy at Safeway.  Good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"The food was anything but impressive. It lacked the wow factor that me and my family were expecting, especially when the portions are so large. To finish off the experience our waitress explained to us how their kitchen has a problem with getting hair into food. It more than less ruined our dining experience."}
{"text":"This was the worst $150 experience I have ever had, tasteless food, hard cold bread that was probably frozen prior. I was so disappointed with the food. They are not that flexible with adding or substituting their menu for dietary or health needs so don't expect it because they wouldn't know how to price it or ring it up, no refills unless you ask. I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Of course, I never realized that the Buca di Beppo is a chain to begin with. When my friend and his wife were talking through about this place, I maintained that I haven't been to one anywhere near my place and therefore, they promised to take me in here for dinner post all the walk and talk in the Edgewater National Park.

Once I entered the restaurant, the ambience was something that took my mind away -with a lot of paintings, photographs, statues and what not..!!

Oh - the fun part had to arrive... the food. \"Small is the extra large!\" - Or so should their ads state I guess. 

We ordered some baked ziti, roasted rosemary potatoes and penne vodka. When the dishes arrived, I was definitely lost as to how three people are going to be able to complete even a fraction of the whole thing laid out there..!! But that didn't prevent me from ordering and almost getting drunk up on their tiramisu. It was really soft and excellent. 

The baked ziti was slightly over hard at the edges. However, it was definitely good. The penne vodka was good as well. 

Big plus - food. Ambience - great. Seating - great. Noise levels - average"}
{"text":"So, we try to avoid chains.  You know, the formula, the boring usual stuff.  Buca actually turned out pretty well, though.  The Caesar salad was fine, but the Italian sausage as a side dish was actually quite good.  We built our own pasta dish and it turned out well!  The rosa sauce was very tasty.  I would say that for a chain restaurant, it was pretty decent."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  But they over charged me .  I called the manager and they said they would send me a coupon for $25 off my next visit.  I never received it!  So the next time I went there I pointed it out and still had the receipt and the so called managers name.  To get a smile and nod.  So watch your charges!"}
{"text":"I usually don't eat chain restaurants, but I have to say this is really good. The atmosphere is great, wait staff were very friendly and professional. The chicken saltimbocca was absolutely delicious. We will defi"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the friendliest restaurants around (although I could name a few more). A very eager to please, cheerful staff and some very yummy dishes. The decor is . . .uhh \"old world Italian\" (I'm referring to the 60's), but the servers are cheerful, offer suggestions and want to make sure you're happy with your experience there. The food is served \"family style', so if there's only two of you order the \"SMALL\" portion and you'll have at least two more dinners out of it! We loved the \"create your own pasta\" option. . .we ordered the \"small\" and yes we'll be getting two more dinners out of it. A fun place offering good Italian food at reasonable prices, what's not to love? Sign up for their \"e-club\" and you'll get some offers that make them even more lovable!!! Oh, my husband had to order their homemade cheesecake with raspberry sauce and hazelnut topping. I thought it would last him three days (he's not a big eater, nor am I) - he practically inhaled it, the whole BIG slice!!! Shame on him."}
{"text":"Great family style Italian restaurant!!  Old school atmosphere, reasonably priced!!  Definitely an option for those who enjoy old school style Italian."}
{"text":"Ok so we had.not visited for a while and we were looking forward to a nice evening   2 couples. We had an appetizer that was undercooked but as it was a vegetable ok.  We ordered Sangria in a liter. It was weak tasting but ok. No big deal. Now the entries. 3 of them HUGE disappointment. First of all the pasta was lukewarm  The entries with chicken in the pasta were just sliced chicken addd in. No flavor. They had no seasoning   Didn't absorb the sauce  Lasagna was the best but served only lukewarm. We had been looking forward to this visit as it was a place our late Mother liked a lot   It was so poorly executed and tasteless it was a waste of 150.00  needless to say we can't recommend Buca any longer. Only reason for giving 1 , the server was polite though inefficient as far as refills etc"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would... but unfortunately, I can't. We arrived at the restaurant for a late lunch at around 3:15pm. Although the restaurant was literally empty, when we asked for a table, we were told to sit on the bench outside and that we would have to wait a few minutes. We saw the hostess constantly running around looking like she was very busy and talking on the phone. Keep in mind that the restaurant was empty, so I am not sure what she was running around doing. We asked for our table again, but we were once again told to wait. After almost 15 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. During this time, two other couples were also told to wait, and they also left. To add insult to the injury, she had a horrible attitude - she was quite rude and dismissive, acting like we were doing something horrible by making her get up and do her job. Definitely the worst service I have experienced in a long time (if not the worst service I have EVER experienced)."}
{"text":"Great customer service, but My family and I had severe food poisoning, 3/7 of us. Horrible experience. Never eating there again."}
{"text":"Good food, LOTS of food on the double dish. Garlic bread is amazing!! Waiter Jarrett was very nice. Helpful with the menu, outgoing and talkative with us."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant as a couple and wanted to have a lovely dinner. As soon as we arrived they sat us inside near the bar area. It took 10 minutes to get the food menu and the drink menu. Within five minutes they took our drink order. Mind you it took another ten minutes to get our simple margarita and iced tea. The server wasn't only serving us but also serving 3 people at the bar. 
We were ready to order and kept eyeing the several servers passing through but none offered to help or to see if we were ready. After another ten minutes of waiting they finally took our food order and brought us bread. No silver ware no napkins, nor any offers of oil or vinegar. After 10 minutes the server was going to the back and we had to call her over just to help out to get our silver ware.
Mind you the food was wonderful, but the service was awful. Only come here if you have all the patience in the world. As for us we arrived about 30 minutes late to our show."}
{"text":"Just terrible. The entire meal was bland, the dishes and knives were dirty, and the entire menu is outrageously overpriced. I honestly can say with certainty it was the worst dining experience in my life. It cost nearly 70 dollars for Pasta, artichoke dip, and bread. The bread was 6.99...why the heck was the bread not included? I'm surprised they didn't charge for the water. I strongly advise you avoid this horrible establishment. Bucca Di Peppo? More like Bucca Di Poopoo."}
{"text":"I loved the baked ziti but the meatball was terrible. Dry old. Burned. No flavor. What puzzles me is why the menu says its one of their special items. Clearly they don't make them fresh"}
{"text":"I've been to this specific location two times so far.  Had male waiters both times, and both guys were very friendly.  I knew I loved the arrowhead location, so for Thanksgiving my friend and I decided to go here, and for Xmas eve my friend and I decided to return with her out of state family in hand.

The out of towners loved the place, said they never knew it existed until then.  They believed the staff to be friendly as well, and stated that they would look for one in their home state and they hoped it was as nice and friendly as our Arizona one.

They also loved the location, surrounded by old town Scottsdale, great places to walk around if you're into taking a little stroll after your meal.

Both times I've been to this location I made sure to do reservations because I know how busy they get and how the lines get long and ridiculous, which should say something right there on how good they are if that many people are willing to wait an hour or more sometimes.

With reservations in hand, we didn't even have to wait a minute both times, they sat us immediately when we showed up.  Each time we had multiple courses of food, shared of course since the portions are large.  And both times the waiters were right there, they were anticipating our completion of a meal between the 3 courses to make sure the next was out shortly.

So there you have it, friendly staff, no wait if you get a reservation, amazing yummy food, and affordable!!!  Geez, was it nice and cheap!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Buca's a couple times a year for over 8 years,
I like that there are 2 stories to this restaurant, with plenty of fun seating options. There's an elevator as well as a staircase.
I still haven't sat in the kitchen though!
The service is never exceptional, but it's always a-ok. Since I usually only come with my bf to this location, I've come to accept that a 2 person table isn't going to get the same attention as a group.
At least the beverage glasses are large, and I usually only want one refill.

The food is as good as any other Buca's I have been to. I love the margherita pizza, chicken parmigiana, spicy chicken rigatoni, chicken saltimboca, chicken limone, and spaghetti with meatballs. Also, the caesar salad is one of my favorites, especially with a side of anchovies!

Buca's is also home to my favorite tiramisu. It's made fresh in house, and is worth every calorie. Moist cake without being soggy, and the mascarpone on top is so creamy without being too rich, topped off with the perfect dusting of cocoa powder. I'm really thinking about changing my dinner plans tonight so I can go get me some tiramisu!"}
{"text":"The antipasto salad was AWESOME.  The lasagna and chicken pomodora was---eeehhhhh.  And the restaurant was FULL of dust.  They had obviously not cleaned the millions of knick-knacks in a year.  I don't care to go back--it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Had our service been anything better than pathetically bad, Buca would be a solid 3 stars.  So here's the deal on the service.  I got a coupon in the mail for a free spaghetti with marinara.  That's what brought us in.  But we also ordered two appetizers and an entree to start with.  I commented that I thought the coupon was a nice idea to bring people in (give away a little spaghetti but sell twice that in other menu items).  His response was \"yeah, if people are like you and order other stuff, but if they just order spaghetti and water... (insert monotone robotic voice).\"  Well, okay then, he should be grateful we didn't do that.

Everything we ordered was terribly slow to come.  Kitchen's fault?  Maybe, but we notice where the other servers on the patio are coming and going, our server is rarely seen and when he is around, he's dragging his feet appearing to be on his way to the gas chamber.  Other than taking and delivering our order, he did nothing for us.  While not rude, he was not pleasant or overly friendly either.  The other guys on the patio helped us out with drink refills, clearing plates, etc.  After a long wait at the end of the meal, he returned remarking someone else was supposed to be helping.  We ordered dessert to go, another terrible wait, and asked our food be boxed.  Finally, he brings the dessert and realizes he never brought the leftovers.  Off he shuffles.  Upon returning, he says he's sorry about the wait.  Not half as sorry as he would be upon seeing his tip I'm sure.

As for the food, it's good, but nothing outstanding.  Even for family style plates, I think it's slightly overpriced.  When they say a small serves 2-3, that's 2-3 lunch sized portions.  If you're a \"healthy\" eater, count on 2.  Here's what we ordered:

Small garlic bread.  Really good bread slathered in fresh garlic, but $7.99.  Yes, it's a good sized basket, but it's still just garlic bread.  Perhaps bread should be offered at no charge.
  
Small mozzarella caprese.  Five nice thick slices of tomato with good quality cheese and whole basil leaves.  $9.99 but worth it.

Small spaghetti with marinara, normally $9.99 but free.  I would say this serves two for a main dish, three as a side.  Marinara was okay, nothing special.

Small chicken parmigiana.  Tasty but overpriced at $17.99 for two breasts IMO.  Remember it does not come with any pasta, just the chicken.

Tiramisu.  Best value at $9.95.  It's the size of a small pie and could easily serve four, but I didn't think it was fantastic.  It's a little too \"wet,\" like you could squeeze the cake and get a cup of coffee out of it.

We wanted to have a after-lunch drink, but the service turned us off to that.  Might come back, might not."}
{"text":"They took our entire party of 18 without a hesitation, had a table ready right away! My brother was incredibly happy with the decision, and the service and hospitality of the staff and the manager, Linda was impeccable! Of course I'm not taking about Buca... I'm talking about Grape Vine!

I'd give this restaurant no stars if I had the choice. We arrived at Buca for our reservation for a party of 17, for my brothers 21st birthday. The server took 20 minutes before she even came over to take a drink order, then when taking my brothers order, refused to sell him liquor. We thought it was a joke, until she explained that their new \"company policy\" was that they can't serve liquor to anyone with a vertical ID. His ID is 2 weeks old, brand new, government issued ID. She had the manager come over after we complained about this policy and how ridiculous it was. She then told us that she will not serve him alcohol, regardless of his birthday or his ID, and told us that if we gave him a drink, they'd kick our party out of the restaurant. Unbelievable. And to top it off, the server walked passed our table three times, over the course of 15 minutes before coming back to us, and all she asked was \"so what are you going to do?\" At that point, we got up and left.

Will never return to this location, let alone this chain. 

My recommendation? Go down the street to Grape Vine!"}
{"text":"This place was really great. I went there with 3 other women and we were headed to a show at 7pm. We were sat right away and advised our server we were heading to a show so we needed to leave at a specific time. We also has a few coupons that we had gotten because we signed up for them last year. Our server dealt with all of this wonderfully. 
We ordered a small caesar, a small baked rigatoni with ricotta, and a dessert. The food was so awesome. It was fresh and wonderful. The small portions were big enough for us to share and allow us to leave the resturant full, but not too extremely full. 
The dessert we got was called the Mount Vasuvious. It was chocolatey and ice creamy and raspberry sauce covered. Just delicious! 
I liked the Italian theme also. I thought the different pictures of popes and Italian people were really interesting. There was nothing negative about this Resturant. They did a really good job and next time I am in Begas, I'll be visiting again for sure."}
{"text":"I have never had Chicken Marsala that was so sweet, it was unbearable. Entire dish was cold. So disappointed, YUCK!!"}
{"text":"Worst service the hostel hostess was the opening 
The server was rude and not at all capable of her job . I got my party of 13 our own drinks all night
Our food took two hours the when it came it was dry burnt and cold
The manger was rude which explains why the staff was rude and incapable"}
{"text":"Normally Buca is good , but prices went up and  quality went down. 

I finished a glass of Cabernet and it looked like a spit chewing tobacco all over the glass with sloths sediment 

My wife ordered a  linguini with clam and marinara sauce .. 
It  had the consistency of soup broth .. Had to be redone ,  an inconvenience 

Fun atmosphere ,  service  was adequate 

We picked Buca for consistency .."}
{"text":"you know how sometimes in people the outside does not match the inside, this is this restaurant's case. The outside does not match the inside. Meaning the inside is better!
Ending up in there not intentionally but as a decision made literally in a second \"there!\"  (as I pointed w/my index)

- Ambiance is awesome, it feels like true Italy (to me) this includes the awesome decor, this was the \"ah! factor\" so much to look at! and Italian classic music was a plus! 

- Service: great! not sure if it was the time and date or what but it was good (I note this because according to other reviews this has been the flaw) 

- Food: great, almost awesome, classic and big portions

Overall, a great experience, a definite come-back and I would suggest the outside expresses more of what the inside is!"}
{"text":"Terrible! There was a bug in my salad, the lettuce wasn't fresh, they burned the garlic bread then redid it but it tasted like the garlic was spoiled , marinara sauce tasted like it was also spoiled, service wasn't the best, although they comped the salad and garlic bread. Bathroom was filthy, ripped, cushion on the booth seat! We will not be back!!! Go to Oregano's!"}
{"text":"Very surprised in a good way. Because, I do have to admit that I came here with much trepidation. But a Groupon coupon convinced me to give it a try. I was ambivalent about the decor. Sure, it was somewhat humorous in a self-deprecating But-Hey-I'm-Italian-I-Can-Take-It sort of way. It was good for a few chuckles and made for an interesting walking tour room to room. It certainly was visually interesting.

The food was well done for every dish. Portions were generous, too. I can honestly find no fault (excepting the price) with the food. I'd eat their Lemon caper Chickens with Artichokes again without a doubt. And I thought the Sangria was subpar (I'd call it a red wine spritzer!). 

I couldn't figure why water was seeping all over the table, until we noticed the glass has a crack from top to bottom. Yikes. And don't waste my time inspecting the glass at the table like a CSI detective. Just whisk the sucker away and apologize. I didn't crack it! So service is rather weak. And even though I ordered a drink, when I don't order a second, Don't Abandon My Table!

Food was better than anticipated, service was not. Borderline on a return."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying their food is top notch, my favorite is baked rigatoni with whole wheat penne and I have the italian sausage replaced with ground beef. I wish they offered a small salad with the order instead of an addon but you definitely get your moneys worth in quantity. ALSO, if you are on the lookout there are ALWAYS buca coupons in the sunday papers, in valpak, and if you search for google apps on android. So if this was based on food I would give Buca a 5.

I took my Italian gf to Buca on her bday at her request and I must say the dining experience was the WORST either of us have ever experienced. We went during the week and they had maybe 8 different \"tables\" or groups dining in...they put us all in the same room (with the other 4-5 rooms EMPTY) and bunched us together with everyone. I'm literally sitting side by side with another group on a bench inevitably hearing every word of their conversation. Ideally you take your gf out on her Bday you want a private personable dinner where you can talk without hearing every word of someone elses conversation....that alone was bad when they had so much room in the restaurant. 

On top of that we had the worst waitress ever, Cassandra.....she harassed us literally every 2-3 minutes asking us if the food was okay, talking about the weather, etc...she was interrupting us CONSTANTLY. My gf and I began being short with her so she would let us enjoy our dinner and she just didn't take the clue. On top of that the host who worked at the front door kept coming back and doing the same, CONSTANTLY. It's nice that people care that your meal is okay, but theres no need to ask us how our meal is literally every few minutes when I'm eating the same thing. My gf and I could not talk without the constant interruption.

Horrible experience dine in but we have continued to go back for their TAKE OUT....We generally will call 20-30 mins in advance, then showup to get our orders and its still not ready often we'll have to sit there and wait another 10-20 mins like they didn't start it until we got there. The food is so good, and they give you SOOOOOO much (leftovers for days) it makes it worth it but the customer service is very low in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have been going to Buca for over 20 years even in San Francisco and I have always been very very pleased. However this time I went to the location on Val Vista with my $20 birthday certificate and was treated very very badly by the manager on duty on the evening of February 9. She refused to except my birthday certificate saying it was not valid bad day yet I had a printout of the email and in no place on the emailit state that. She said she couldn't do anything for me because it was half-price pizza night. Are you telling me she doesn't know how to operate her own computer after the way I was treated my meal & my glass of wine should've been comped but instead she asked me to pay for it which I did. I will no longer be a customer at any of you restaurants in any of your states you have lost a long and loyal customer due to the Mishandling My Situation by an untrained ignorant management team at the Val Vista location!!!  Go to Rigatony's!"}
{"text":"Okay let me get started I've gone to this restaurant twice first time not bad of an experience. Second time we'll it was just horrible we were seated at a table when we had asked for a booth. When we had questioned the waiter he went to the kitchen to ask his Co worker is he'd take us in his section where the booths were. We were hearing them argue that one didn't want to take care of us and neither did the other!  At this point we're were frustrated and starving so we waited until the waiter came back to tell us he will be helping is even tho its not his section.


Once we received our food all of our pastas were extremely hot on the outside and the top layer but once you dig right in it was all cold! Unbelievably we stayed and ate what was hot and left . I would not recommend this location. Wish I remember the waiters name! Horrible service and food!!"}
{"text":"Popes round table is the best place to sit with a large group! Out of everywhere my book club has tried this is our collective favorite. We can see and hear each other, our service is always good and so is our food. I know we will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! The inside of this place is so cool. Tacky Italian dining at its finest. Literally my new favorite place. The food is super yummy, huge portions. Don't bother with a table, go hang with Matt at the bar. So great! Attentive, polite, and on top of it! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had a party if 23 and made reservations the night before. Buca accommodated us easily and happily. 

We had a prefixed dinner. Salad were placed on the tables right before we sat down. A caesar salad and a house salad with Italian dressing. We were served Fettuccine Alfredo, Spaghetti with a meat sauce, Chicken Parm and cheesecake for dessert.

The dishes were good. The only thing I didn't like was the cheesecake, it tasted like it was frozen for a while. 

The service was great. Drinks were great. Atmosphere was perfect."}
{"text":"We recently held our small wedding reception at this location on 2/18/12 and I would absolutely NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone with ANY kind of party. First off, if you want to make a reservation for a celebration they make you sign a contract. You damn well better make sure that EVERYTHING they verbally promise you is put into that contract. The lady we talked to on the phone, Jennifer, said the rooms were \"semi-private\" and \"partitioned\" meaning that they were off to the side and that we would have our own space to mull about and have our little party. We all showed up after the wedding and from the get-go, it was a bad experience. Our tables weren't ready so everyone had to hang out in the packed lobby for 15 minutes (it was February and quite chilly outside so that was really our only option besides sitting in our cars). When they called us back, our \"room\" would have been great for a party but they had sat 3 additional tables in there with us! Instead of letting us spread out and sit comfortably amongst the booths and tables, they crammed as many of us as they could into these long booth/table combinations so that anytime anyone in the booth area had to get up to go to the bathroom, the entire side of the table had to shuffle about. When we asked the manager about this, he denied that they even offered private rooms (though I passed many on our walk through the restaurant). Instead of checking with the sales coordinator, he made us pull up our contract on our phone right there so he could point out that the contract does not specifically guarantee us a \"private\" room only that they reserve the right to make changes and only attempt to honor our seating requests. We decided to just sit down, shut up, and make the best of it. Our servers were nice and the food was good but the whole thing just felt rushed. We were still able to get up, have a little toast, and hang out but you could tell the other 3 tables in there with us felt really awkward about having to share their space with a party that they were clearly intruding on (though it was no fault of their own). When it came time to pay the bill, the jerk-manager begrudgingly gave us a discount for the inconvenience. My sister and I noticed that this included a reduction in the servers' tip.  When we asked jerk-manager about it he looked quite disgusted and made the snide comment that \"everyone is going to have to suffer for this.\" I found it to be absolutely unacceptable that the poor waitstaff who makes $2.13 an hour had to suffer for their mismanagement so in the end we left them a rather large tip. They couldn't clear us out of there fast enough, while we were all trying to get our coats and say good-bye, we were having to dodge busboys slinking through trying to clean so they could seat another large party. We ended up going with Buca because Maggiano's required a much larger reservation fee for an actual private room. In retrospect, I wish we would have gone with them, the price would have been worth not having to put up with that manager."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely horrible. We had reservations for 11, two weeks in advance. So management knew we were coming, yet they didn't prepare for our group. We hardly had our drinks refilled, we ordered basic items off the menu and it took them almost 2 hours to get the food out to our group... TWO HOURS.. Twice we had to hunt down staff to ask for refills and water.  Once the bill came, it came out to roughly $35 a person which included tip. Looking at what we got for $35 I would definitely not recommend dining here. The food taste is mediocre at best. For $35 we could of went to other establishments and had a 5 course five star meal. It was great to hang out with friends. We all agreed not to revisit Buca for any future group needs"}
{"text":"A mess from top to bottom.

We walked in at 8:00.  Slovenly host, slurping on a soda and chewing the ice.  Ten minute wait, but when we were actually seated, most of the tables around us were empty.

The place was a mess -- unbussed tables and the nearby bar counter was loaded up with dirty glassware, some of which came crashing down at one point.  Servers were tossing silverware and dishes into a dirty collection area right next to our table.

Servers ambled through the place like characters from a slacker movie.  It took about 15 minutes for our server to come to the table and he appeared drunk, slurring his words and couldn't seem to walk straight.

Ordered.  Another 15 minutes to get our drinks.

The big bowl of green salad came and it was green all right -- practically nothing but iceberg lettuce.

The final straw was when two kids sat down at the next table and our server sat down with them.  They were obviously friends and carried on a conversation that would be more appropriate for a gogo bar.

Abort.  I found the manager and said we wanted the check.  He had a besieged look on his face and was hardly surprised.  Seemed like he had seen it all before.  He took our drinks off, we paid and left.

It's too bad because I love the concept of family-style Italian dining and remember some good meals I had at this place years ago."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday dinner this past weekend and I wasn't too impressed. Everything on the menu is like family style, small feeds about 2-3 people and the large feeds 4-5. My husband and I ordered the chicken Alfredo with broccoli and when our food came out I must say it was a pretty big portion for a small. It actually fed 4 of us. I was very disappointed because they had no hot sauce, but I understand some places don't offer it. The meal was bland , it didn't really have a taste to it. It was just missing something. 

I must say our waiter was delightful ! He was very attentive and always made sure we were taken care of. 

I gave it a 3 star because if it wasn't for our nice waiter, I'd just give it a 2."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for about as long as I can remember, almost 20 years, but we only recently started going to it a few years ago.  I'm not sure why it took us so long, because it's super noticeable coming off the highway heading towards the mall.

Anyways, my dad's a huge fan of Italian food, so he likes to go here whenever he's craving anything like that.  They recently started doing family style -- where each Small Plate serves 2-3, and each Large Plate serves 4-5.  We were stumped -- we wanted to try a few different dishes, so I asked our server.  Enter the Quattro Formaggi, a 2-chicken, 2-pasta dish for $20 that was perfect for us.  Great rec from the server, and he took care of us really well.  

Food was good -- a little cheesy for my tastes, but I'm not the biggest fan of Italian.  It was still good, and my dad liked it a lot.  Leftovers were gone within a few hours.  Also, their bread is good with the oil and vinegar.

The cool thing about this place is that once you walk in, you've got hundreds of pictures and images on the wall -- I don't think that there's one blank white/red space at all.  All black-and-white and sepia pictures of people enjoying pasta, movie stars, baseball players, boxers, you name it.  It's kind of overwhelming, but it adds a cozy-ish atmosphere to the place.  Very Hollywood.

Overall a good experience, with excellent service.  Come with your family."}
{"text":"This restaurant is going downhill. I\"m guessing since other locations have opened nearby in the hotels this is where they have sent all their worst staff. Went in recently and waited in the front for about 20 minutes with no staff nearby to help -this was not at the end of shift or anything so no excuse to not have a staff member at least checking for walk ins upfront. Once finally seated the staff was running around like crazy trying to take care of the few patrons that braved the dinner experience. (It was by no means \"crowded\") they had the bartender helping with orders. The kitchen was messing up orders and then fighting with the staff over it. Took over an hour to get our food. Meatballs were burnt everything else was \"okay.\" I've been to many different locations from CA to WA to NV and never had an experience like this, I highly recommend trying a different Las Vegas location - this one will shut down soon."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday Wednesday. Server was very good. Place was pretty empty. Food was so so. Nothing special. We came here years ago and it was much better. Food has gone down hill. Very expensive as well. Just not impressed. They need to step it up a notch. Very plain, boring, basic food."}
{"text":"Came here to have dinner with my whole family in celebration of my eldest nephews 21st. We ordered the antipasto salad, pepperoni pizza, eggplant and chicken parm., and baked ziti. I died and went to a marinara and cheese filled heaven! I am the queen of making eggplant parm. (This is my official title.) But they have beat me at this dish. It was so good, crispy, not soggy at all. Delicious. If you've never been I highly suggest you go with a few friends and order all of the above mentioned and don't forget your elastic waistband pants! Overall it is a great atmosphere, the decor is great to look. My 3 year old exclaimed that the photo of the lady with the big melons looked like his mom. The lady literally was holding melons! Ha! Lots to look at. Great place to enjoy a meal with family. I love this place. It is a bit on the pricey side but I feel it is worth it for the portions and not to mention the food is great."}
{"text":"My first visit to this establishment made possible by my husband for Mother's Day. He was looking for a family-friendly restaurant that would be appropriate to include our infant. The waitstaff made our night out easy for us to enjoy. We had a corner booth that gave us room to spread out and a sling for our car seat carrier. The bread was soft and warm. Our pizza had the right amount of spice and tang. There was only one disappointment of the evening and that was the supposed mixed green salad we ordered. There were no mixed greens, only iceberg lettuce. The salad was fresh and good, but it was not mixed greens. We chalked it up to being Mother's Day weekend and the fact they were hosting a lot of graduation dinners. This is a good place to eat and the atmosphere is right for any occasion."}
{"text":"On April 17 this year we married in the Little Church of the West- and we planned a family dinner at Buca di Beppo in the Excalibur.

We were served by Johnathon who was great! Our drinks and family style pastas were good.
The youngsters in our family enjoyed the specialty drinks.

Staffing was short but (I hope I spelled his nam e right) our server kept up the pace and I think he even stayed after the rush to keep everyone happy.

The headache of dealing with the Excalibur valet parking rush did not dampen our spirits.

Good thing I had squeezed into my blingy dress and got married before dinner- lots of garlic bread and drinks later I was a larger but happy bride!!"}
{"text":"I would like to highlight the excellent service my friend and I experienced on Monday 4/2 in celebration of some very special news. Mars was \"all over the table\" making sure that we had ample warm bread and that our orders were exactly as we wanted. He allowed us to have our private time to talk but we never felt like we didn't get the attention we needed. Service with a smile. 
Manager Noresse came over personally to follow up because we they did not have the Balsamic that I love for my bread, so no worries, he and Mars got to work and brought us yummy Balsamic Glaze, which actually tasted even better! We tore that up!
Several servers came over to offer a big \"congratulations\" with a the amazing lemon cake and a big candlestick to make me feel so special. 
Although the meatballs and spicy chicken pasta weren't as good as usual, I can say that the client service as well as the $20 off of $40 (super high value) coupon from the e-club made this trip very memorable. Ask for Mars and Noresse and you will feel like King or Queen for the day!!!"}
{"text":"Went with my husband and kids for the first time and loved this place.  The food was amazing.   We had the stuffed shells, stuffed chicken and lemon chicken scampi type dish with capers (forgot name).  So good!   I will definitely have my company Christmas party here this year."}
{"text":"Loved it when we lived in NM so we were happy to have dinner here (especially after the nasty buffet the night before at Mandalay Bay). Zach was our server and was good, as was the food. Always plenty of good food to be had. The chopped salad kicks Olive Gardens salad to the curb! We also had garlic mashed potatoes, garlic bread, lasagna and the best manicotti ever! My only disappointment was that they no longer have Spumoni (the one in NM had the best spumoni I ever had). I was really looking forward to it :("}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant in Chandler AZ on Ray road Sunday February 12th with my friends.  I must say that every time we go back there we are more and more disappointed.  The value of the food vs. the cost just is just ridiculous and the taste, well lets just say it used to be a lot better.

Another very disappointing thing is that when I tried to order a non alcoholic strawberry dakari, I was informed  that they could not serve it to me at the table and I would have to go to the bar and drink it if I wanted it.  I ask you, what kind of crap is that?  If I ordered a coke or lemonade they could served it at my table or even a regular dakari with alcohol but that was not what I wanted.  They told me some story that I believe to be nothing but BS about the liquor laws, and found out I was right too.  To confirm this, I just had dinner at The Keg restaurant in Chandler, yes the same city governed by the same laws as the Buca I ate at on Sunday, and I was informed by the manager that to his knowledge there was no such law in Chandler or AZ.  He even confirmed that with another manager.  I got my non alcoholic dakari with my dinner at my table.

Sometimes I can over look bad food or even bad service from a restaurant but I have a hard time overlooking being lied to!  The only good thing I can say about our visit Sunday night was that all the employees there were really nice.  They lied to us but at least they did it with a smile on their face."}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot after a not so great experience going to their Thanksgiving meal.  I will have to admit, they redeemed themselves.  The food was very good and the quantity was very good.  Myself and another ate, had salad, lasagna and a chicken dish, brought about half of the food home.  The tiramisu for desert was excellent and huge, unable to even finish half of it.  Service was very good and did not feel rushed at all.  

Only complaint is that this place is loud, but that is part of what this place is about, family style and enjoying the company.  

I would go back for the regular menu."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this location.  I have eaten at Buca many times, and really enjoy their food.  So then it comes down to location....this one was good.  Friendly service, seated fast, overall I would give this place the highest marks."}
{"text":"Michael Nichols the general manager of this establishment is not much a manager he's more like of an apologetic person because our dinner last night sucked on angles. I do now realize that \"Buca di Beppo\" caters to \"larger parties\" but that's technically discrimination towards smaller parties I do understand it's a holiday but just like the so called manager did explain that the upstairs dining area could accommodate smaller parties his hostess staff choose to stick us in a side room where we had to enjoy our night. Wasn't much of an enjoyment people speak so highly about the interior and it's entertaining I didn't see anything entertaining about where we dined, oh that's right because we got stuck in a small dining area because the hostess was so overwhelmed we had to catch the grief. When we asked to see the manager just to explain and voice our opinions he felt that nothing was wrong that we're just complying over being sat in the bar area. Being apologetic is great I get it you don't know how to be a manager as much as your hostesses don't know how to control the from waiting lobby but all we wanted was the same experience everyone else got as my mother had never been there before she wanted to explore this so called cool restaurant but if the hostess & manager act like they only \"cater to larger parties\" I think I'll refrain from returning as this manager thinks he's staff did the best for us they could possibly do"}
{"text":"I came here because I had a coupon for a free fetucenne Alfredo. We also ordered the caprese salad. The food portion was huge. We were able to get 3 servings from the pasta and it was a small portion. We had awesome service and I can't wait to go back to try the other items on the menu. We asked about the spaghetti sauce and he brought us a small bowl of it to try to see if we liked it. Who does that??? That was so awesome!!!"}
{"text":"We had an absolutely horrible experience here celebrating my grandfathers 75th birthday with 4 generations last week. 

We have been patrons here for several years and even had our rehearsal dinner here (to the tune of $5K). The service has never been phenomenal but the atmosphere is great for families and the food is pretty good. 

Back to last week, with six we made a reservation for 530 and the restaurant was pretty dead. We ordered appetizers and entrees and it almost came out too fast, and the two courses overlapped. Our drinks were never refilled. Then we waited approximately an hour to get our check. We paid by credit card and when it came time to sign and tip, our debit card was nowhere to be found. We tore the table apart looking for it and then politely asked our server (Breanne?) to check in the back to see if she might've left it near the register by mistake. She assured us she didn't and says she put it in the left pocket of our bill and that we must've lost it. Taking her word for it, we tore apart the table again and even asked nearby tables to to look under theirs as well. 

45 minutes later we never saw our server after again and since we were pretty sure we never got the card back, we asked if a manager could help. The manager, Marie assured us again that they didn't have our card, but a few minutes later she came from the back with it and basically handed it to us and said \"bye\". In my experience in the restaurant industry, a saga like this that is the restaurants fault absolutely warrants a comp of the check. However I had to ask if there was any way they could compensate for the trouble they caused. Marie shrugged and comped an entree but we still paid a ton for this horrible experience and the server still got the full tip. 

This experience sadly ruined the night even when they had at least 2 chances to make it right. I wish there was a way we could re do my grandfathers 75th birthday but he left the next day to his home state."}
{"text":"This restaurant has everything you need. The vibe there is incredible, makes me feel like I'm in Italy, munching on my favorite eats. It is quite pricey, and any meal you order is big enough for 2 or more. I tried several meals, because as an avid food inspector i just try several plates to get a correct opinion on their food. The pasta was incredible, the tomato sauce had a great spice to it and the noodles were a perfect size. The pizza was very cheesy, but not big enough to be worth $22. I was pleased with the customer service , expect the Pepsi they handed me was very watered down so they replaced it for me. I would definitely come back to this place with a group of friends. I recommend."}
{"text":"Love bucca!  Always delicious. From the caprese tonthe stuffed chicken pruccietto all delicious!  Add great service and Bam!  Jarrett was amazing and always knew what was needed.  Treated us as royalty.  Amazing start to the long weekend"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  Ordered take out for the first time - eggplant parm and salad.  Delicious!  The eggplant could have been a bit more tender, because they cut it nice and thick... and maybe a little more marinara, but we were definitely impressed.  Who knew!"}
{"text":"If you have LOTS of time on your hands then come on and give them a try.  But waiting for over an hour now just for the main dish to get here is a bit ridiculous to me.  Waitress seems easily distracted, especially since she confused our order. The bread was super cold. Not sure if that's the norm. But it took a good 35 min just for us to finally receive that!  I don't think we will ever come back here again."}
{"text":"I'm not mad, I'm not even saying that the food was bad.  I just wasn't happy.

The service was decent & the food was plentiful... it seems that they were going for quantity over quality.

I wasn't really impressed by any of the food except their pizza was okay.  The best way that I can describe their food is \"generic.\"  I wasn't blown away, like I was hoping to be.

I was visiting Las Vegas for my 30th birthday, a local friend kept telling me about this place.  She was hyping it up like I was going to orgasm with each bite.  I was like \"hell yeah, I'm there!\"  Well, my short sightedness smacked me in the face like it normally does.  

I am fortunate enough to have grown up in an Italian-American family, in an Italian / Italian-American neighborhood, my grandparents barely spoke English, I have more Italian restaurants at my disposal than I can count.

I should have thought this one through before saying yes."}
{"text":"I have to start this review by saying I've been in love with Buca for years and years.  Back before they got bought out, I used to go all the time, but once they took my favorite dish (macaroni rosa) off the menu I got sad and now I don't go as often.  However, they sent me an email a week ago saying they'd brought back some old favorites.  Guess what was on that list?  Yep, you guessed it, Macaroni Rosa!!  Needless to say I have been twice in the last 2 weeks.  It's almost as good as I remember it... although it does seem to have more garlic now.  They also brought back their best salad - the 1893 salad.  It has meats and cheeses in it and it's awesome.  My list of Buca favorites (besides the macaroni rosa) includes the chicken limone, chicken parm, ravioli with meat sauce, and green beans.  Go with a large group or expect lots of leftovers because everything is served family style.  Although, they do have a lunch menu now with individual portions and they are never busy at lunch time.  Join their eclub - they'll send you coupons, which make the bill easier to stomach.  Bottom line - their food is fantastic.  If money grew on trees I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"The food is very mediocre not worth the price. I don't understand how an Italian restaurant can mess up pasta but there it was, undercooked. No flavor. No taste. And no refills to help wash it down. We had to ask 3 different times for another beer to go with our meal  Then proceed to chase down the waitress so we could finally get the drinks... Horrible service.  Don't waste your hard earned money here. Go to RigaTony's!"}
{"text":"Christmas day is a hectic day for them to remain open. They totally helped being open especially in Vegas for out of town family, and families large enough but small enough - to not have any dishes at home to wash on this special holiday.  Reservations made through Open Table.

Dionna, our server, was quick on her feet and patient.  She repeated our order after ordering.  For an evening such as this, it's deserving of the servers to get a little more tip - especially if they were accomodating... And still offered dessert even though diners know one can feel like a stuffed turkey eating here.

As with my SoCal review, we can never get away from having their spaghetti and meatballs.  This never fails.  Although we do think about another type of pasta, discuss it a few seconds; the result is still their spaghetti with meatballs bigger than the size of a tennis ball.  

But we did throw in something we hadn't yet tried- their stuffed chicken parmigiana.  Lesson: if having stuffed chicken parmigiana, omit ordering any appetizers.  You'll be satisfied with their warm bread and olive oil.  

Unless your a professional food scarfer, and for whatever reason you have that extra expandable stomach with a hunger switch that takes forever to shut off.  By all means, eat and be merry!"}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant for the first time this past Saturday for a friends birthday, and the food was good! 

I knew it was family size servings, and the menu states that the Large portion feeds up to 5 people, but honestly it can feed a family of 7! We had a party of 12 and ordered: two pastas, a pizza, and a salad, and had tons of left overs! The portions are huge, and like I mentioned the large size can def feed more than 5 people. 

The table reserved was nice, and apart from the noise. So it was nice being able to hear everyone, and enjoy conversations without having to yell. Their birthday celebrations are cute, and different in a way. They sing, and bring out a big candle, along with a dessert for the birthday girl/boy. It was nice.

Only downfall was that when we were seated servers would walk past our table, watch us sit there, and not offer any drinks or service. After 10 minutes of waiting one of the girls in the party got up, and asked the host who our server was, and how we've been waiting for someone to take our drink order. Finally, he shows up, and provides us great service throughout the evening! 

Overall, it was a good experience minus the minor hiccup. I would def go back."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was AMAIZING best burger I have had better than five guys or in and out and I've worked in fast food my whole life and have been a manager quite some time so I am usually really picky , great food ,great people , and we got our food in no time"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night. Put in our name for a party of two, waited 40 mins for a table. Just sat there after they called name after name... till we saw it was just the two of us there... I finally stand and ask how much longer is it going to take... the woman asks for my name then says we seated you 20 mins ago! Oh really??? Then why have I been here in front of you for the last 40 mins? Then she apologizes then grabs menus and tries to seat us right away? Not too busy now??? Just too shady... and we left... definitely not a way to run a business..."}
{"text":"Had an awesome girls night celebrating a birthday!!! Jarrett is the best server out there"}
{"text":"Ever since I started eating at Buca, I stopped going to Olive Garden and other mediocre eating establishments altogether. The reason is simple: Buca's food is delicious. I really think Buca needs to hype their pizzas more because they are some of the best pizzas you will ever taste. And for those who complain about the prices; 1) You get what you pay for in the food business; and 2) Join the eClub. 

The eClub sends me coupons on a regular basis. For example, the Mother's Day coupon was spend $40 and get $20 off. That's a great deal. Since I've been coming to the Mesa Buca, I've come to know the manager George who does a lot of the seating arrangements. He will respond to any issues you may have and is happy to accommodate special requests. 

Overall, it's a great place to eat whether it's a romantic evening for two or you are with a group of people."}
{"text":"Nice quiet Sunday dinner. Party of three and we were sat immediately. 

The anti-pasta salad and chicken limon are to die for. The chicken is so very moist cooked perfectly and the lemon (limon) sauce with capers is just perfect. 

The only bad thing we had tonight was the Brussel sprouts. They were cooked to death, burned all the way through and tasted like burnt fire. The waiter was very apologetic took it off our bill and offered a different vegetable free of charge. 

Very nice experience!"}
{"text":"Walked in in the pouring rain to a snotty hostess telling us it's a 45 min wait with no one there. Saw the dining room with about 10 empty tables while 4 parties walked out as we were trying to find another place to eat. We were told yeah we just can't make it happen right now. Rude!!!"}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo has always been a favorite! Although this Buca di Beppo branch does not offer the same homey feel as the ones in San Diego, the Buca in Las Vegas was enjoyable as well. 

After a very long drive from San Diego, our big family decided to stop by Buca for a family style dinner. Their dishes are definitely meant to be shared so it is best to come here when you have a bunch of people tagging along with you. For their antipasti, the mozzarella garlic bread and fried calamari is a must! Make sure you ask for extra marinara sauce because you would want to dip your calamari in that tomato goodness. For the insalate, you will never go wrong with the Caesar salad. That bowl of greens is very refreshing! For pizza, order the spicy arrabbiata although I think it is a bit weak for my liking. If you name something \"spicy-whatever\" make sure that it is spicy enough. The large linguine fruitti di mare made up for the not-so-stellar spicy arrabiatta. Always a favorite, their fruitti di mare is a must for seafood lovers.

I would have given this restaurant a 4 but gave them a 3 instead because of the spicy arrabbiata. And even though the fruitti di mare was very good, at least 6 of the mussels were closed. I think that was poor preparation. Such a shame..."}
{"text":"Heading out east with a large tour group, we stopped for dinner at this national chain.  Sigh ... t'was the tour company's choice, not mine.  Having endured underwhelming meals at Buca locations in Illinois, I was prepared to cringe and shudder.  

But this location earned 4 stars because their staff was particularly friendly, accommodating and efficient.  In general, Buca is geared towards group dining.  Rather than just one large dining room that becomes impossibly noisy when crowded, their restaurants are divided up into a maze of smaller, conversation-friendly rooms.   Serving each course family-style is much more expeditious than doling out individually plated meals.  Special requests for food substitutions due to allergies, etc. were handled quite well here.

We indulged in generous platters of salad, chicken Parmesan, fettuccine Alfredo, spaghetti with marinara sauce, and cheesecake.  Nothing fancy or gourmet here, just straightforward Italian-American comfort food freshly prepared and served piping hot.  And this chain's year-round Christmassy décor is ... well, never boring.  The photos of nuns driving bumper cars always crack me up."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service we have ever had. After booking for an 8pm with Open Table, we found out that the restaurant doesn't accept reservations after 5pm. So why does Open Table book reservations after 5pm? Because clearly Buca di Beppo doesn't like Open Table reservations based on our terrible experience at this restaurant. 

We were seated in the bar area and didn't see a server for 15 minutes. Finally someone working the bar came over and took mercy on us. We ordered drinks, an appetizer and a main dish. About 15 minutes later we got our drinks and appetizer and we thought things were going to be okay. 

How wrong we were. We literally did not see a server for the rest of our visit. We asked someone about our entree after waiting another 30 minutes and they snapped at us that the restaurant was busy. We finally got our entree after 90 minutes. We could not believe it. Servers kept walking past our table and completely ignored us. Obviously here is what happened. We were never assigned a server because the bar person who took our order didn't follow up. We waited and waited for a check which of course never came either. We had to walk to the front and ask the hostess for our bill.

Clearly Buca di Beppo does not care about customers (especially those who have Open Table reservations) and it's safe to say we will never return."}
{"text":"Best italian food in Las Vegas. It is so tasty.....

Whatever you do, you MUST order the cheese garlic bread with the marinara sauce.....trust me your life will be complete without it.

Now they say that their small serves 2 or more people..., Honestly, I'd say after eating the cheesy bread that could serve 4 or more people...so much food.

The customer service was delightful as well which always makes me happy :D"}
{"text":"We have been back to this location by the urging from corporate. We were not disappointed! The sauce was much better, service was really good, we were seated right away and served hot & tasty food. Whatever the issue previous, they must of worked it out."}
{"text":"Good food. Love the Spicy rigatoni and antipasto salad. Disappointed in the terribly slow service."}
{"text":"Wow, one small dish at Buca di Beppo is the same as two large dishes at any other place!  So don't expect to ever go hungry after a visit there!  This past week, I went with a group of six people to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday at Buca di Beppo in Scottsdale.  We made a reservation online (which can be made through their website or through OpenTable) and were seating pretty quickly upon arriving.  We made a request for a \"good table\" and apparently were brought as far into the restaurant (through the kitchen and around several corners) to a round-table in an alcove with quite a fun personality.  

As we showed up to dinner in the later hours of the evening on a weekday, there were few other diners at the time, so we practically had our own server to ourselves.  We ordered a large dish of chicken limone, salmon sorrento, and a create-your-own-pasta with pesto.  Those three dishes were SO MUCH that it made an entirely additional meal of leftovers for four of us the next day.  The service was great for the most part though it appeared that one dish was left behind (as it arrived much later than the other dishes).  Oh, one of us did order a glass of wine, and we added a salad as an appetizer.  

After the meal, the entire staff arrived with a candelabra to blow out for the birthday girl.  We all joined in with the birthday song (which was written on the menus).  We chose a delicious jumbo piece of chocolate cake instead of an entire small white cake.  You can get one too by joining the eClub.  When joining, you get a pasta discount (which sometimes changes) along with a birthday special $15 off a $30 purchase PLUS the full cake when you make a reservation to celebration with a group of four.  

Certainly an experience worth having at some point though be aware that the small dishes are good for 2-3 people, and the large dishes serve approximately 5 people.  All quite pricey but delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Great for large groups and celebrations!"}
{"text":"I think Buca is actually a pretty great place as long as you follow the formula:
Bring online $10 off coupon
Bring a good group of friends who will share 4+
Be flexible 

Came here for a white elephant christmas lunch with 11 people. Ordered cheesy garlic bread, meaty salad, two types of rigatoni, eggplant parm, and proscuitto stuffed chicken. Only leftovers for one serving of pasta. Success! Everyone was happy, full, enjoyed making fun of the creepy rotating Pope head on the table for sharing, and were well catered to by multiple staff. My water was always 1/2 full :)  Final tab under $20 a person with drinks and over 20% tip (they don't add gratuity too which I love!)

Music was the perfect level too which I don't think should be undervalued. No shouting to be heard but not so quiet the whole restaurant could hear our conversation. Buca can be a good time as long as you come prepared!"}
{"text":"That is really a zero rating. This place is the worst I've been to in many years. I was there on Christmas with reservations. We might as well have had no reservation. The wait was at least a half hour,and the lobby was full. No seating. Hostess was rude and clearly hated being there. Believe me,they should have let her stay home. When we finally were seated. There was no napkins or silverware. We asked several times,and finally got some after the appetizer arrived. It stunk,as did the prosciutto stuffed chicken and baked ziti. Mentioned to the server that the ziti was lacking sauce and dry. He never did a thing about it. We never were offered a dessert menu,and were quickly given our check and hustled out. Never again. Good bye Buca."}
{"text":"The food is great and the portions are epic. The service was great too.

My friends and I were getting drinks at the bar and I did not like how my bartender-server was too outgoing. The man would not stop talking about himself. If I want a obnoxious bartender, I would go to a bar instead."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service! You get a lot of food for what you pay for. I would highly recommend coming here if you're craving Italian. The cheesy garlic bread is a must."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary/Valentine's day.
We are never disappointed.
Service, spectacular.
Good, plentiful as it's family style.
Tiramisu that I could eat every single day.
Weekends are very busy, so make reservations."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, lasagnea, and chicken... I just order three plates for a family of six and brought home tons of food that we could not finish....excellent to eat relax with family"}
{"text":"**edit** David, the manager, reached out to me about this experience and was very attentive to details about our dinner last night. He genuinely seemed to care and wanted to make it right, inviting us back and to call and make a reservation so that he could put a personal touch on things. Thanks so much David for improving the situation!!    

**original post** Overall frustrated. Restaurant was not crowded on a Friday evening and our server couldn't be bothered to interact with us, instead he was covered for by his awesome coworker, Jen. 

I'm not one to not leave a tip--in this case I left cash for Jen and a note for our server about why he wasn't tipped. Hopefully things get better."}
{"text":"We came here for my brothers rehearsal dinner. The service was excellent, the food was above average. The spaghetti and meatballs tasted burnt. At least the cheesecake at the end was good."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo - We were at the Westlake location on Easter Sunday. It wasn't crowded. The service was about average but the food was the worst Italian food I've ever encountered. Cleveland has many excellent Italian restaurants but this isn't even close. Let me explain - the salad plates were hot and I mean like they just came out of the dish washer hot; there were 4 adults and we spent about $125. The best thing I can say is that we bought gift cards ahead of time so had fuel perks from our grocery store. We ordered one meatball and it was cold in the center; the chicken prosciutto was warm but there was almost no prosciutto in it; we ordered broccoli and the server came back to tell us they were out but we could have mashed potatoes instead - who ever has mashed potatoes with pasta; we also ordered alfredo and it was incredibly bad - it was as though it had sat out on a counter for a long time, the sauce was congealed and completely inedible. Couldn't locate the manager on duty if there was one so we couldn't register our unhappiness with the meal. When I got home I sent an email to Buca listing the above and was told someone would be in contact with me from the restaurant - I'm still waiting. Interestingly enough, I was at the beauty salon today and we were talking about what we did in the way of eating on Easter Sunday and I mentioned this and the woman next to me said she'd had a similar experience but didn't complain because it would have had no results and the woman working on my hair said she would never, ever go back after having two bad experiences. I can guarantee I will never, ever go back. It was a horrible meal."}
{"text":"Good food, but first you'll have to walk through spilled sewage on the sidewalk, outside their front door."}
{"text":"Kinda pissed, they won't let me us my coupon because I'm seating with another couple? We had two separate bills and ordering our own food?????? Bast@rds......."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. The restaurant is very big and so are the portions. It is pricier but that is because of the enormous size. The smallest size entree can feed 2. We got manicotti and baked ziti and ended up taking a lot home for a delicious lunch the next day. The bread and the olive oil they gave tastes pretty good. The bathrooms are also clean which is very important."}
{"text":"Based on decor, I think the intent is you feel you are dining at Nona's house.  Given the overwhelming stench of mildew, moisture, and feeling of dampness, you feel like you're dining in Nona's kitschy basement dungeon/kitchen, and Nona is having issues with water and her foundation.

Seriously wtf.  I knew they used space heaters to heat the restaurant in the Winter, but something is seriously wrong and likely unsafe with thier building.  My friends wanted to stay an eat, so against my better judgement I had lunch and considered it multi tasking -- eating and inhaling toxic mold spores at the same time.

Our waitress was nice.  I ordered the Pasta Del Sol and my friend had the Chicken Parm.  I also had a wilted, yellowed caesar salad with my pasta but I didn't send it back bc I was starving and obviously down for anything (for eating there in the first place).

the pasta del sol was so so, but anything involving carbs cant be too wrong.  The chicken parm was actually VERY good, and it was a relatively inexpensive lunch.

I wont be back though, its seriously grody inside and if there are no mold issues they at least need air purifiers thruoghout.  I hope someone from Buca corporate reads this and takes action."}
{"text":"I ate at Bucca di Beppo a day after eating at Il Pizzaiolo in Mt Lebanon.  This was unfair to both my waistline and Bucca di Beppo because it did NOT hold up against Il Pizzaiolo.

Also, i'm doing Weight Watchers and I ended up so far over my point allowance I'm pretty sure I'm getting kicked out of Weight Watchers.

The food at Bucca is heavy, salty, full of garlic, and expensive.

I also do not like dining family style.  I was there attending a birthday party where I did not know everyone and sometimes food can bring people together but in truth I just wanted to order what I wanted to eat without having to ask if everyone else would have some too--because every menu item is $20.

I love chain restaurants and I believe they CAN have good food but the red sauce at Bucca is one step above chef boyardee. 

I am giving Bucca 2 stars because I did enjoy the stuffed chicken breasts and I think the atmosphere of the restaurant is a fantastic place to have a party--we were in the Pope room and it was so fun!

But then, the food came out...  I feel bad for all the reviews where people say, \"This reminds me of the sauce my Mama used to make...\" :(  Your mama can't cook.  I'm sorry.

I will probaby be back because the desserts were good, but the next time I come back I'm going to take extra blood pressure medicine (even the salad was salty!), and stick with ordering a few appetizers."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend that said the food was great and not too pricey considering it's a couple of minutes away from the strip. Katy mentioned the seafood linguini which was amazing!!! Service was personable highly recommend going back! Thanks Katy for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo will fill you up!

I have always been a huge fan of Bucca. The atmosphere in these restaurants are very fun and support the theme they are trying to represent. I really love how they tour you through the kitchen on your first visit. Very classy and old school Italian vibe.

I can here with a friend for dinner. I remember I was starving when I arrived here, and couldn't wait to eat! The service here was outstanding! Our waiter Samantha took very great care of us, making sure we had full beverages and if we needed anything additional. 

The menu has a fine selection of pastas, entrees, and great dessert dishes.

I ordered a pasta dish a la carte, I did the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. Also ordered the cheese bread with it. The Alfredo sauce was very delicious with a sweat flavor to it. 

Next time I visit this place I am going to try their spaghetti dish, and also try a glass of their wines. 

Such a great experience coming here, and I truly do recommend it!"}
{"text":"It's a little different since it is family style serving.  Not use to have to agree with my husband on what to order lol.  But, wow great food huge servings.  Nice staff.  Would definitely recommend the stuffed shells."}
{"text":"Something to keep in mind when deciding whether to go there: they serve meals family style. The 2 person size feeds two very well. The decor and atmosphere are very eclectic and cool!"}
{"text":"I've been to Buca di Beppo before at other locations, but this branch made me remember why I am not a regular.

They sat us in the rowdy bar area (where guys were getting drunk and shouting at the TV prior to noon!) even though we came for lunch and it was so cold that you could probably build a snowman.  The management might want to save money during the winter but who wants to come into a restaurant that requires a jacket for warmth?  Even after requesting more heat two different times, it never came.  The bartender was the server and she didn't hide her ambivalent attitude toward her job.  I'm not sure that I blame her for that.

The pizza was also a complete rip off (go to Papa John's if you want pizza)!  The crust was as thin as paper and the proportion of cheese to pizza sauce was about 1 to 5.  The food echoed a desire of shareholders to up the profit margin.  After all, for most of their items, there is a reason why they offer the big portions that they do - it obviously allows them to reduce expenses (staff, energy, itemized purchases) and increase profit by serving in bulk under the guise that it is an \"Italian\" thing to have large portions to share.  If you've ever been to Italy, you know that they all don't eat according to such a model!

The Mozzarella Caprese is good though, and can almost be a meal for two when coupled with the complimentary bread.  The bread is nice and soft, but like a child, you are restricted to having the server pour the oil and vinegar.  Aside from the yummy bread and Caprese, I do not find much of a reason to return."}
{"text":"I have great memories of going to Buca and having delicious shareable plates, bursting with flavor. I had a less than stellar visit recently.

I ordered the chicken and prosciutto entree (Gluten Free) and made sure to mention it twice on the phone. I also ordered a side of pasta and marinara.

I arrived on time but they'd botched the order so had to wait around an extra 15-20 min. That was annoying but they did throw in some garlic bread. 

When I finally got to the pasta it was boiled noodles with a spakling of sauce. I ended up spending $9 for boiled noodles basically. I could have done that myself in my own kitchen.  

So all around, not a good visit. Its pretty frustrating to wait around and then get stiffed on the sauce."}
{"text":"First time at this Buca location. Just had dinner, and am so pleased with the friendly service. The food was good, the waiter was AMAZING, the hostesses were absolutely delightful. I would give 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at Bucca and beforehand all I knew was that it was Italian... The atmosphere and decor are very NY/family/warm. It was nice to look at all the pictures on the walls :)
After looking at the menu we decided to get the fried calamari as an appetizer. It was a decent amount and the sauce was good. I was pleased with this dish.
For my main entree I decided on the spaghetti with meat sauce...
It took about 20-30 minutes to get to me, I am a patient person but I was really hungry... But I didn't let that bother me :)
I got the Small dish thinking it was just a plate and boy, it was a bowl to feed 3 people at least... By this time I was a little full of bread, water, and calamari... But I did like the flavor of the sauce as well as the noodles... I was satisfied with my spaghetti...

Next time I know to take more people and split dishes :) there seems to be a lot of reviews with complaints on proportion so we will keep that in mind... 

Ps one of the strawberry desserts looked awful yummy! I need to try it next time!"}
{"text":"The food was on point with any other Buca di Beppo location.  Not overly sauced pasta, hefty hefty portion.  And the chicken in the chicken Alfredo was cooked to near perfection.  $45 for a heaping bowl that can feed a family of 6 easily is a pretty decent deal when in Vegas.  The di Beppo 1893 salad however for $25 is a rip off.

why 2 stars for good food then?  The service was bad.  We were quickly seated but it took the waiter well over 15 minutes to greet us.  Quick and friendly was his greeting when he finally did arrive.  But once the food was dropped off by the food runner we didn't see him again during the meal, having to ask for refills from other servers.  The guy that came to refill our waters, I asked him if I can place an order of bread with him but he said he'll get the waiter.  Who never came.  When we finished our meal the waiter shows up with the check (never asking who our meal was).  We asked for boxes and that took an additional 15 minutes to bring out even though there was only two other tables in his section.  Instead of getting us boxes and closing out our tab he was cleaning other tables and doing side work.  

Good food.  Not so good service."}
{"text":"Not impressed, to be honest.  The fact that portions are large and \"to be shared\" meant we had to try to agree on something or pay a lot extra for two separate choices.  We have very different tastes.  

Finally agreed on stuffed chicken and a green salad. That the entrees don't come with sides was a little surprising.  

Our waiter was very nice and service was quick.  It was certainly convenient not to have to leave the hotel."}
{"text":"Great food with huge portions. I'm from the east coast and this is some of the best Italian food I've eaten in a while. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the server we had was wonderful. I recommend the pasta....of any kind really."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with with my inlaws as a thank you for watching the kids. Once again Jarrett made our night special!  His charming personality always shines through. He enjoys his job and it shows in all he does. The food was wonderful, as always!  My favorite was the Shimp Fra Diablo!"}
{"text":"From the time that I booked my reservation for a large party (30 days in advance) to the time our dinner was completed, my experience with this restaurant was poor and unsatisfactory.    I repeatedly tried to preplan my event for my daughters graduation  to find a delayed response with poor customer service from their \"banquet manager\" Jennifer. 
The food was poor quality with a lack of options for variety.  Topped with incredibly extremely slow service (half of my guests left before all good was brought out and staff was more concerned about packaging leftovers than getting all the food I paid for out).  On top of poor tasting food - I feel like I just threw away my money and graduation memories of my daughter.
When complaints were made to management, the resolution was \"I am not sure how we can resolve this.\""}

{"text":"Last night my husband and I enjoyed our anniversary dinner at Buca. We love Italian food, and my husband has a very large appetite. This was my second visit and his first. We enjoyed the kitchy decor. My husband had a soda (driving), but I thought celebration. I began with a Cosmo Fizz. Delicious and strong. The bruscetta was creatively served and was good. The meatballs were as big as my mother's, tasty though plainer, and the tomato sauce is simple and delicious. It enables you to taste the food it is paired with. My husband enjoyed the chicken parmesan with a side of pasta and sauce. I ordered the chicken marsala with rosemary potatoes and broccoli for sides.  The chicken marsala was on the sweet side with almost a glaze feel to the sauce. It was ok. The potatoes and broccoli were yummy. To accompany my dinner I had a glass of Ste. Michelle reising. It was light, crisp, refreshing, and delicious. We ordered tiaramasu (sorry about the spelling) for desert. While it was tasty the lady fingers had not been soaked enough making it a bit dry. Ashley was our server. She was very friendly, thoughtful, and attentive, and knowing we were celebrating our anniversary she did not rush us. Overall a good experience."}

{"text":"Looking for true Italian? This is the best pasta I've found. We had the spaghetti with meat sauce. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the gravy was spiced to perfection. Our second dish was manicotti again the pasta was cooked perfectly the best manicotti ever. The service was also great. Family style service is just like eating at home. My family of five ate for about $80. Overall a really great birthday dinner for my wife. Thank you, Buca."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is spectacular!!! Request Andie Haro!!! She is a great server!! And special shout out to the manager Raymond who was very accommodating to our party!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here Friday night it was great! The apple Gorgonzola salad was my favorite! Followed closely by the Bianco pizza, great flavor combo!"}
{"text":"Not sure why other Yelpers are complaining about service, but we had no issues and no waiting (maybe because we had a 9:45 reservation on a Thursday night). My friends and I agreed on the dishes we were gonna share beforehand and ordered the second we sat down, also letting the waiter know that we'd appreciate the check ASAP as we have tickets for the 11pm show next door ;-p
We ordered the my standard spaghetti frutti di mare which was delicious and seafood-filled as always, and a salad. 
After paying our check, we left the restaurant and realized that we were so efficient with dinner that we still had time to kill! We spotted a happy hour which offered $5 sangria, so naturally we went. We then realized that we're just in the bar area of the the restaurant. The sangria glasses were huge and it was delicious. 
I wouldn't go out of my way to come here (Excalibur eek), but good option for dinner if you are at this end of the strip for some reason"}
{"text":"Our server was friendly, but not very attentive. The restaurant was very cold, and the spaghetti was mediocre. I ordered the sparkling sangria, and it was a cheap bottle of sparkling rose with some fruit floating around. Took a long time to get the check."}
{"text":"Recently went to Buca di Beppo for a 30th birthday dinner for one of my best friends. Giving it a 5 for the awesome service. Traci was amazing! Everyone else was amazing as well and helped each other out if we needed refills or plates removed or anything. I had previously visited a location in Columbus and wasn't very impressed but this visit def changed my opinion. My only complaint is that the spaghetti didn't have enough sauce and was kind of bland for our group but that was quickly resolved when they brought us some extra sauce. Stuffed shells were delicious!! I'd def visit again!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I are foodies and we're always on the hunt for a delicious new date spot in Vegas as locals! We went last night and had a great experience! For Italian it's a little pricey, but keep in mind that the portions are family size so it's perfect for sharing. We started with the trio appetizer, the baked rigatoni and the stuffed chicken with prosciutto. Now I need to say that I am extremely picky about Italian food being a born and raised New Yorker, but I thought the meal was really good. The sauce for the rigatoni was a little sweeter than I like but the creamy pesto sauce for the chicken was great! Of course my boyfriend preferred the rigatoni to the chicken! Good experience and great service! Also the Excalibur has a killer food court selection so you can grab a Krispy Kreme on the way out! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We came in tonight for a casual dinner after work. We've eaten at Buca before and it has always been enjoyable! Tonight unfortunately, the AC was out and the place was still packed. It wasn't too bad in temperature so we decided to sit down anyways. We sat in the bar area where it's typically quieter. Our server was very kind and honest about the situation. 

We ordered a pizza, salad and cannelloni. All we're delicious. 

At the end of service the manager, I believe her name is Vicky, came to our table and personally apologized for the AC issue. She gave us a complimentary dessert and apologized again. Because of the hospitality of the staff this evening, we were willing to stay and eat and plan to come back."}
{"text":"Yeah they have big portions but i didn't notice anything special about their food. I got food poisoning from the spaghetti and meatballs I had here. The atmosphere was cool but I was packed and the waiter looked so stressed I felt bad for him."}
{"text":"Love, love eating here... the service was fast, the food was fattening and the restaurant was in a great location and family friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered eggplant and chicken parmigiana. Plus Apple, Gorgonzola salad which is delicious. A small is more than enough for two ppl. So is a side of spajetti. The eggplant had two huge stacks which were delicious. My husband had three huge patties but something was sort of off. But he ate it. Then I tasted it and said this is veal. We asked the waitress to give us at least one chicken to take home. Well she made it right. 
Which was delicious , more so than the veal. My husband was very happy with that. . Anyway great customer service and wonderful meal. Of course we will be back. Then another customer on way out handed us a 10.00 off making the day sweeter. We have lots of leftovers. This is a place to share entrees that is if you can decide on the same thing. So happy they were open today."}
{"text":"Always love Buca. Took my boyfriend here for his birthday. This was his first Buca experience. Our server Jarrett was friendly, attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the menu.   We will be back many times!"}
{"text":"On our vacation we stopped thru Vegas to see family and have dinner on a Sunday. My cousin was being deployed the next morning for 7 months, and Buca Di Beppo on Tropicana was his favorite place, so of course that's were we went. Lorenzo, the manager, greeted us and was extremely friendly. Nick our waiter was great at first. He explained the menu and everything was wonderful. We ordered  several drinks, appetizers and entrees (well over $200). The food was awesome! We hung out, ate and visited. Meanwhile he brought us our bill, before we were asked if we wanted more  drinks or dessert. Because we were so busy visiting I didn't notice that one member of the party gave their credit card for the bill. Up to this point it was a great experience, then to my surprise a hostess came to our table and informed us they had a reservation party coming in and they needed our table. Completely caught off guard we didn't respond. Looking around there was over half of the restaurant seating available. We were interested in more drinks and dessert but because of this rude lady we got up anyway and continued visiting outside. No one came in after we left. I returned inside to use the restroom before getting on the road and the table was still dirty 25 mins later. My local family that spoke highly of this place is completely disappointed in this \"family\" style restaurant that cut our family time short!!!"}
{"text":"we ate there for the 4 or 5th time never disappointed food  is always great service a little slow
but worth it will recommend to friends"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great portions and delicious food. Service was fast and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Buca is mall food. So, when I walked in, I expected it to be at about a 3 star level, and that's what it was. The pasta was fine (not great, just fine) and the sauces were okay, a tad on the heavy side. Their \"famous meatball\" was impressive in size but flat in flavor. The antipasto salad was good, but we got so sick of how cheesy it was. Could have used more meats and less cheese, for sure. (But, they're tailoring to the mall demographic, so I get it). The prosciutto stuffed chicken was good. There was WAY too much breading on it, and I ended up scraping off a lot of that. The chicken was a tad chewy, but not outside of what is to be expected for this kind of place.

The service attendants were quite nice, though. I have nothing bad to say about them. 

The restaurant was FREEZING. I know they advertise having A/C as a positive attribute, but that doesn't mean it should be 60 degrees in there. I literally was blowing on my hands and rubbing them together, and that was with a hoodie on and long pants and work boots to keep the rest of my body semi-comfortable. 

We went because we had a $50 gift card. If it wasn't free, we probably wouldn't have gone. We probably won't return unless we're given another card or we're in a major food bind and have to settle for a place like this."}
{"text":"I'm currently eating here now. My server is terrible. It took 20 min to even get bread. The bruschetta is a pile of tomatoes in a large martinis looking glass. My drink has yet to be refilled. This sucks."}
{"text":"Sat down for lunch at 11:36 and our entrees were served an hour and 15 minutes later at 12:51. It was 4 adults and 4 kids and during lunch hour... restaurant was barren. Hard to understand the mess up. Manager did comp us so that was appreciated.
Chopped Salad was great, ziti was ok, Chicken parm was good."}
{"text":"We just do not get it. Buca is very popular for tourists and locals alike. And we just do not understand why. The restaurant is nicely decorated with a lot of nostalgia. It does have a great ambiance.

However, the service was poor and the food was below average. We attending a birthday celebration with reservations for 18. Our server, was not only trying to handle our party, but several other large parties in his section. I will confess, he did his best to be patient and efficient, but he was in way over his head. 

We could not get drinks, bread, or dinner in a timely manner. Our reservation was for 6pm. We placed our orders at approximately 6:30 pm and it was not until 7:20 that we were served. 

When the manager finally came out to help our server, it was because members of the other parties in our area were complaining. And then they tried to help everyone. Eh, maybe a bit too late to placate the patrons.

The food was warm and not the quality we expected. In retrospect, we would recommend Bravo Italian Restaurant in the Galleria Mall.  Or their sister restaurant, Brio, at Town Center. Their method of service is much more efficient in that all of the employees work together to make sure your meal is served quickly and hot. And their dinners are not served family style, so you can get what you like, individually as opposed to in mass. The food was over priced, but the portions we large! 

While we typically like to leave positive reviews, we just could not find a few good reasons to give one to Buca!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Bucas for the first time with my wife. Let me tell you it was a horrible experience! We were seated in an empty room on which the ac was turned on to its max. We felt like in a freezer. The service did not start off to be that bad but quickly showed how understaffed the crew is. The food was disgusting...tasted like a froozen Walmart Lasgna. How think that the food tastes great at this place has no clue about Italian food! Never going to return or recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go for my family this time.  The service was friendly and timely.  The food tasted terrific.  We had the Chicken Parmagiana, Baked Ziti and four cheese pizza (which was just ok-  thought it needed more cheese) and a Mixed Green Salad. I prefer dining in because the fun, lively atmosphere and family-friendliness."}
{"text":"This is may be my favorite Italian Resturant in Cleveland.  Chicken Parmesan great, eggplant Parmesan tremendous, Italian Sausage with peppers fabulous. Tonight Shrimp Florentine tremendous."}
{"text":"I was out in AZ for business about 2 weeks ago for a whopping 24 hours... maybe less. 

My co-worker and I decided to hit this Italian place after settling into the hotel. I guess this stretch CAN be busy, since there's a whole training facility across the street, but that night, it was DEAD empty. Actually, there was nobody standing at the front of the restaurant to greet us! The place is overflowing with pictures upon pictures upon pictures, all of Italian families and kids and famous people, religious figure and so on. They had a special area called the Pope's Table (or something similar) with a bust of John Paul II in the center of a Lazy Susan. Tacky? Absolutely. Interesting... sorta. 

The main dining area is upstairs. The server was very pleasant though, but I wish the food was better. They serve buffet style, so they have their menu set up as \"small\" and \"large\", with small serving 2 and large serving 3-4 people. We settled on something simple, tortelloni. But it just wasn't good. It was kinda blah and that was disappointing considering we passed a grill and a steakhouse before deciding on this place. The wine, however, was very good! But that's the wine. The riesling was damned tasty.

And then the kicker. So the fire alarm goes off and you know, I'm from NY, we don't screw around when it comes to alarms.  The server just kinda looks at us and is like, \"oh that went off 3 times today, its no big deal\", and goes about his business. We were half out the door! I said enough is enough, paid for the bill and left. 

Crazy Arizona."}

The meatballs were a little mushy and lacked a presence other then the size.  The pasta was good, cooked perfectly and tasted good with the sauce. The chicken parm was fantastic. Simple yet tender and plenty of flavor. The salad was bitter....?  The bread was great, the cheesecake was excellent.

{"text":"We came to Buca di Beppo last week for a late lunch after my step-dad's funeral.  I chose this location both for its proximity to my home and because I knew they had several large tables to accommodate a party of 10.  I expected them to have fairly generic but decent Italian comfort food, I expected the over-the-top decor and quirky art, what I didn't expect was the level of service which was the nicest I've had at any restaurant in the Valley.

When we told our server about the services we'd just come from, he was both sympathetic, warm, and a great judge of our mood.  He was kind to my mother and got her drink first thing.  He was tolerant of my son who had missed his nap, and he was never too busy to fulfill our requests for substitutions to the pasta, extra napkins, more wine, or separating our left-overs into multiple boxes.  To be honest, the food was what I expected - decent but not stellar.  But the service was 5-star and on an occasion such as this, it really made the afternoon less stressful and as pleasant as possible.

Thank you Buca di Beppo, my family and I look forward to returning soon (for a happier occasion of course!)."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make before I go any further with this review: My husband and I occasionally visit chain restaurants when we really don't want to put much effort into going out to eat.

OK now that is out of my system, I can continue. We've been to Buca before (visited the location in Columbus probably about 8-10 times with friends for group dinners) so we know the concept and that it's about sharing and all that jazz. We ended up at this location on Sunday night when we were trying to find *gasp* TGI Fridays. Well let me save you a drive to this part of town and tell you that Fridays is no longer there. Anyway, we saw Buca and decided to suck it up and eat there. We had about a five minute wait and then were led back through the kitchen (as you are at any Buca) to our table. We had some confusion with our service because at one point we were told our waitress got a big party and wouldn't be handling our table anymore, and then she did for the rest of our night. Weird.

Unfortunately the food was not as good as we remembered. The cheese garlic bread was cut into squares and wasn't served in a pie shaped. The caesar salad was under-dressed, but as a plus it held up nicely as a leftover for me to have the next night for dinner. Chris thought the chicken parm was not as good as it used to be (we think they changed the recipe or something). My side of fettucini alfredo was good thankfully and heated up nicely on Tuesday night as my dinner. All and all, the food was a major disappointment even for chain restaurant standards!

The bright spot was that for $69 (includes tip) we got four meals out of the food we ordered. Buca was a 2.5 star experience for us, but I'm rounding down to 2 due to not living up to our standards."}
{"text":"Went last night with a couple of friends. One of my friends is gluten free and vegetarian.  They gave her a GF/V menu. She ordered the bruschetta.

Way too rich and heavy, I had 1 scoop and that was too much.  We all shared the Cheesecake with raspberry sauce it was supposed to have hazelnuts but they must have forgotten them.  They took us upstairs in an elevator, the service was really slow.  Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My family (my parents, sister & grandparents) came here on a Sunday evening to celebrate my dad's birthday. We had a gift card to use so we \"had to come here\". Needless to say, we left very disappointed...

We asked for water with lemon and got no lemon. The water took quite some time to come, yet the restaurant was fairly empty at this early dining hour. We ordered a large seasonal salad (had too much dressing), a large chicken marsala (although it should feed 6, it had only 5 small pieces of chicken), a small spaghetti marinara (simple but acceptable), and a large garlic mashed potatoes (incredibly small serving- I had to ask the waiter if this was truly the large!). The bread they served was fairly hard and cold. They pour olive oil and balsamic vinegar to eat with the bread, but it really needs some herbs or spices to be tasteful. Needless to say, we left hungry and dissatisfied. The waitress took over 20 minutes to bring us back our change. 

They gave my dad a nice brownie and scoop of ice cream, free of charge, but besides that, this dining experience was uninteresting and misleading (in portion sizes)."}

{"text":"I decided to drag the monkeys and my man out to lunch because a dear friend/co-worker wanted me to meet her new boyfriend. She decided on Buca Di Beppo for the family style dining and the kid friendly atmosphere. 
We arrived at 12:30 and of course my daughter's little DVD player ran out of batteries...so the lovely hostess offered her power outlet at the stand and even tried to hide it behind the trash can (that was super nice of her to care). We were sat almost immediately and Tracy came over to greet us. She was very friendly but very busy so our service suffered a bit (hey...she's only human...not superhuman). No biggie....she was doing the best she could. 
The food was decent...very Americanized Italian but the monkeys loved it...which means we will be back. The prices were not awful either....the lunch portions are the way to go.
Overall I will be back for a family dinner if I think about it. The highlight for me was the gnocchi and the smiles my kids had when pointing out all the stuff on the walls (lots to look at)."}
{"text":"EDIT:  7/14/2012  -- I was contacted by a restaurant representative through Yelp regarding this review.   The message included an apology for my experience and said they wanted me to contact their customer service by email so they could \"reach out\" to me.  I sent off an email over a week and a half ago and they still have not \"reached out\" to me.

My review:

Usually a disappointing experience when I go, and I'll likely not go back.  

Food is okay.  It's why they get a grudging 2 stars.  It's family-style so they bring a big platter or bowl of what you order and everyone serves themselves.  I don't mind that.  Though one thing that's kind of annoying is that you have to order side dishes as an extra with your entree.  For example, if you order a platter of chicken parmesan, you just get a platter of chicken pieces and nothing else.  If you want some pasta or potatoes to go with it, you have to make sure you add it on as an extra dish.  Would it be so hard for them to put a combo-type offering on the menu so you get an entree platter with a side dish?  Even if we pay the same amount as ordering it separately, it's still a perceived value and wouldn't make customers feel like they're paying \"extra' for something that seems like it should be included with a meal.

Service is either very poor or just okay.  Servers seem to all be rushed and busy, like they're too overloaded to do a good job.  Each time I've gone, I've had messed up orders.  Once, we ordered cappuccinos before the meal, and the server went and came four times before he brought them during the middle of our meal...and only after I reminded him the first three times he had come back and kept forgetting the coffees.  When he finally brought them he made an excuse, saying he was busy and the coffee machine was very far away from our table.  Yeah.  Last time, I was with a party of 5.  After we ordered our meals, one of them got to the table very quickly (turned out he brought it to the wrong table and it was supposed to go to the table next to us), while the next three meals came out 30 minutes later, and the last meal, my meal, actually never came out!!  He seemed to forget mine and when asked about it, hardly seemed apologetic at all, just a tad embarrassed, and just said that the kitchen didn't have any of the dish I wanted.  Seriously!?!  He couldn't tell me that earlier?  I ordered another dish to-go since my party was nearly finished eating.  But then he came back a minute later and said he checked with the kitchen and they actually did have my original dish.  Ugh.  What a nightmare of a server.  So after all that, I did get my dish to-go.  Nothing was taken off my ticket, though they gave us one dessert for free for the 5 of us to share.  Pretty lame.

Bottom line:  Poor service.  Food is okay, but not good enough to overlook the service.  If you're craving good pasta, spend your hard-earned money at a different Italian restaurant that appreciates their customers."}
{"text":"I've been to Buca several times and have never been impressed with the food. The atmosphere is fun but a restaurant needs to have more than a fun atmosphere. The food is less than average.

Our waitress was unfriendly and all business. No personality at all. The whole time i felt like we were just an pain in the ass for her.

Now on to the food. We ordered a caesar salad which i could not even eat because the whole thing tasted like fish. I'm ok with a slight anchovy flavor but this was un-eatable. Apparently the dish comes with anchovies standard or on the side. I guess there is no getting around the nasty fish taste, even if you ask for no anchovies at all. The other dishes we ordered were the macaroni rosa, manicotti, and chicken marsala. The macaroni rosa was only slightly warm and lacked flavor. I've had pink sauces before and this was no where close to them. (Maggianos has a great vodka tomato cream sauce) The manicotti was probably the best of the worst but really...how can you mess up manicotti. It's a noodle with ricotta cheese in it. The chicken marsala looked so good with huge mushrooms and a rich sauce. I took one bite and was done. The sauce was so overwhelmingly sweet that i though it was a desert.

The only reason i went was to see some family out of town and the decision was out of my hands. I thought, what the hell, I give it another shot. Buca  Di Beppo. Yet another disappointment."}
{"text":"I went here on Mother's day to celebrate because it was one of the few restaurants that take reservations on that day and everyone likes Italian. It was my first visit since High School so it's been a long time. First, the decor is not exactly kid friendly- with all the nudity (men and women) and odd placement of different pictures/paintings/and weird stuff on display. 

Our wait time was long but that's to be expected on a busy holiday. Our waitress (Megan) was very pretty but I could tell she was overworked as she rushed around the place, spilling my drink from moving so fast. I didn't mind; as long as the food is good. 

I had tried the spicy chicken marsala which was very different but also very good. It was super spicy for me but I cannot handle spicy foods but I thought I was ok when I declined to order the \"super spicy\" version of that dish. I also tried the spaghetti and pepperoni pizza too. The food was very delicious, especially that pizza (surprisingly). 

The portions are meant for two which is not ideal for picky children but it's nice for a date or whenever two people get together. Their food doesn't really come in different sizes, everything is served \"family style\" which I disagree with. 

Overall, the food was great, our waitress was nice, and everyone left full. That's all I care about."}
{"text":"Just finished an amazing birthday dinner here. First time for a couple of us and food and service was exceptional. Jarrett was our server and I have to say he was by far best server ever. Very attentive! Great experience!!!! Will be back"}
{"text":"Can you say- alot of food. First time patron and wasn't that impressed. It's alright nothing spectacular. Just feels like and taste like your at olive garden on steroids."}
{"text":"Always a great place for family style dining. Friendly staff but at times you may have to wait if you don't have reservations."}
{"text":"#1 cool thing about Bucca is the family portions. Love that you can come in and serve the family out of central bowls of spaghetti. It's Almost as good as eating at home. Downside, they use processed white wheat when they make the food. If they used whole wheat, this restauant  would jump to 4 stars in my eyes."}
{"text":"We had to wait because they only had one server.  Several people came in and left when they were told they were understaffed.  The waitress was odd to say the least.  She was not talkative at all and did several odd things. She brought the food and held a plate and just hovered it above the table for us to move stuff and never said a word.  I asked for a refill and received one but she never asked my friend.  She brought containers to the table and then came back and took some of the containers and gave them to another table.  I told her we needed three and she said oh I shouldn't of taken them :/ she asked us several times if we were ready to put the food in the containers and we said we were still chatting that we would do it soon.  She came over another time and started putting the food in the containers and slopped the noodles everywhere.  There were several noodles in the bread basket and on the table.  The food was fabulous but wow, Krista must of been having an off day.  I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe the other server called in sick and she had to come to work when she wasn't planning on it.  It was just odd.  I'll probably return to see if the service improves."}
{"text":"This restaurant should not be this fun or good - but it is.  Eggplant is especially unique; had it twice.  Only complaint is the dining room was way too cool - no, cold - on a recent visit."}
{"text":"The ambience is warm, the service very good, but the food is just okay.  The basics (spaghetti and lasagne) are good comfort foods and enough for two people.  In fact, I felt like I somehow must have ordered a trough of spaghetti, the portion was so large!   However, I had to ask for more sauce.  My friends said they, too, always had to ask for extra sauce when they ordered pasta.  

The caprese salad, usually a favorite of mine had a dressing that was so \"subtle\" I couldn't even taste it.  Others in my party wanted to order something different so chose the veal saltimbocca.  We were assured the small portion was big enough for two.  But when it arrived, unlike my overflowing spaghetti trough, there were three small veal pieces with razor thin slices of prosciutto on top, artichoke hearts and very little of the buttery lemon sauce.  Not worth the $27.99. 

Prices are okay for the basics, especially when you consider one order will feed two.  Just remember to ask for extra sauce."}
{"text":"We are usually extremely patient and understanding with businesses in general however, we just left Buca di Beppo without eating due to extremely poor management . We made reservations weeks ago for Christmas Day and planned our day around the meal. We arrived to find a huge line out the door for take out and reservation seating. We waited over an hour and were not seated nor could the staff provide an estimate on time. The take out line did not move and I did not witness anyone receive their food (take out or dine in). Although the staff appeared to be working hard they either over booked or were extremely short staffed which is a management/supply chain issue. We do not plan on returning due to this negative experience . We left along with several other parties in favor of IHOP which was the best bad choice."}
{"text":"I am reviewing for takeout that we took to our room. 
First, I understand the family style approach, but I don't like it for couples. For my husband and I, we would usually each get something different and share. The way the ordering works here, we can't. 
Lasagna is usually a winner at Italian restaurants, but this was disappointing. The sauce lacked depth and overall, it didn't have the indulgence usually part of the baked pasta experience. The garlic bread was also just mediocre. 
In the end, I felt like I wasted calories. Not a good thing in Sin City."}
{"text":"Takeout NIGHTMARE on Easter! Wow. I have never seen such disorganization or incompetence in my life! My family and I are Buca regulars,  but not after this! I ordered and paid online the day before Easter, and set the pickup time as 11am, the same time the doors opened.  When I walked into the full lobby,  nobody was at the hostess stand or at the carryout window, phone ringing off the hook.  Long, frustrating story short,  I received my 11:00am order at 12:06pm! I had people waiting at my house for this Easter dinner! Way understaffed,  and who is making the schedule!? I asked for a manager and was told that there is NO MANAGER there until later in the day!! And this is Easter Sunday! Terrible. No explaination, no refund,  no apology... nothing but $120 in cold food!"}
{"text":"I'm glad they were able to serve such a large party without much hassle to us. So I commend the staff. As for the food, it tasted very generic as I can't remember which one was the best... I think I remember the apple salad. Yes that one! The calamari, fetta, baked zitti, etc were generic. Although I think the caprese was nice and the chicken parm as well. But for the amount of money spent, I felt like the only thing going for this place was the large family portion style and the fact that it wasn't terrible Italian food. Definitely been to places with better food."}
{"text":"The reason I give this place 2 stars is because of price and average food. We had a party of 6 and we ordered a large lasagna, a small shrimp florentine, small basket of garlic bread, a beer, and 3 soft drinks. My bill came out to be 100 bucks. The lasagna wasn't great. It lacked meat and it was overly salty. I wasn't impressed at all. And a large isn't so large. You would think that the large would be fairly a large portion when it says it feeds 4 or more people. Trust me, when you have a group of men, it will probably feeds 2-3 people. The lasagna was $40 dollars for a cheese lasagna with no meat. It says meat sauce, but it was just salty cheesy tomato sauce with not a single meat piece. Skip the lasagna, not worth it. The shrimp florentine was good and the garlic bread was delicious. Everything here is al a carte so the bread was $10! And the shrimp florentine was $30 for a small size. What kind of irks me here was that they charge for refills too. So when everyone got refills on their root beer and diet coke they charge $1.75 or something for each refill. So, it was 20 bucks roughly for 3 sodas and a Heineken. Wtf. Let me tell you guys, in Vegas there is not a single establishment that charges for refills on drinks. I feel like this place is a money eater and sends out overly salty food. When the waiter came to ask, would you like a refill on your drink, my party made the assumption that refills were free. I'm surprised they didn't charge me for my tap water and the cups and utensils I used. Jeez. My head was hurting from the massive intake on salt after that. I don't mind dropping a 100 bucks for food, if it was good. A bit disappointed with them. Won't ever be back, way too many great Italian places in Vegas to spend that much on mediocre food."}
{"text":"Our waitress Paula was awesome! Great service, recommendations, and personality. We didn't have room for dessert so she dropped off some star bursts candy haha it's something little but a little goes a long way."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Giving this restaurant 5 stars! From the moment we walked in the door we received great service. We were immediately sat down at a table by Jamye and greeted by Cindy. Both ladies were super pleasant and attentive, talk about teamwork camaraderie. As our drinks were kept full and conversations engaged this location definitely made us feel special. The manager stopped and checked our table to make sure we were doing great. (Tall, slim guy with blonde hair) As we were debating on getting dessert Becca stops by and persuaded us to get 2. We will definitely will be coming back to this location. As a Native American woman with children I usually experience poor service and stereo typing at other restaurants. But this establishment has made me and my children feel welcomed and appreciated as a paying customer."}
{"text":"Buca is the pioneer for family style Italian food. Everything on the menu is good especially the lemon chicken. Come with a family or group of people you enjoy spending time with and this restaurant will provide a very fun and memorable atmosphere. If you are lucky enough to reserve the kitchen table you will sit in the kitchen and watch the chefs prepare all the food as well as sample different dishes throughout your dining experience. For a large party, the Pope table will suit you well. It is a very large round table with a rotating Pope head in the middle, very interesting.  The only problem is if you are coming here with just one other person because the portions can be quite overwhelming and get expensive."}
{"text":"I've only been dining out for 34 years, but our trip to Buca today (Christmas Day) was the WORST dining experience I have ever had. 

It started with us making our reservation online.  That was seamless as there were plenty of reservations available. Once we got to Buca Arrowhead, while we were waiting to be seated, 4 different people were turned away because they did not have a reservation, even though there were reservations available online and plenty of empty tables.  As business owners ourselves, we were shocked to see so much money walking out the door for no reason.  However, after our experience, I'm thinking that those folks who were turned away were the lucky ones.  

We ordered salad.  The lettuce was brown, but we decided to let that go.  30 minutes after we were seated, our 4 year old son's pizza was brought out.  30 minutes after that, we still did not have our food.  Our son had long finished eating and was bored. Our waitress visited the tables around us 4 times but never checked on us, refilled our long emptied drinks or given us an update on the status of our food.  But all that aside, our food had FINALLY arrived so we figured we'd dish up and eat fast.  However I guess our food had sat in the back too long.  Our baked ziti was cold and our daughter's chicken parm was rock hard and her noodles were cold.  We had to get up to go find our waitress at which point she took our food back.  Then a manager came to our table and said, \"Sorry about that.  We'll reheat that for you\" and he walked away.  REHEAT?  Seriously?  He didn't even pause long enough to give us a chance to say if we even wanted our food reheated...or I don't know...replaced.  I had to chase him down to tell him that our 4 year old was not going to wait for us to get new food and then wait for us to eat it.  He offered me no solution and did not ask what he could do to make it better.  I finally said, that we would like our salad and our son's pizza comped and that we would be leaving.

Not that I need to tell anyone how to do their job, but from our point of view, had we been given a little attention and concern and not had to come up with a solution on our own, we would have gladly paid for our whole meal.  We left and our Christmas dinner ended having to be fast food.  Thanks for nothing Buca Arrowhead."}
{"text":"Seriously, how many F words can you not use on a Yelp review? How do you order app, a salad and three entrees.  Salad came first then bruschetta (wtf) toast and tomatoes and cheese.  Don't give it a sweet name and take 50 minutes to make it.  Also the fact that we order lasagna and you are out of it?  You couldn't tell me that during the 50 mins that you were making bruschetta?  How long does it take to make lasagna?  Wait someone told me longer I'm sorry I didn't go to culinary school, I guess nether did your cooks \"I use cooks loosely\".
I would recommend a better Italian place but I'm Scottish, I would say stay home drink beer and make macaroni and cheese!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great portions. Overpriced. Pizzas not so my style. Staff not too friendly. Bread served cold. The minestrone soup good, but price?"}
{"text":"What an interesting peek into the celebration that is the Italian family dinner. This place has almost a nostalgic feel to it in the fact that there are lots of large family sized tables filled to the brim with generations of families dining and laughing. The restaurant itself is decorated with old Italian decor and has a real homey feel to it.

Now, my view may be a little skewed because I was here on a first date and it ended up being one of the best dates I've ever been on. This may have made the food taste better but in reality it was pretty damn good food at a reasonable price. I didn't realize that the \"regular\" portion was for 2+ people and was a bit worried at ordering a $20 Veal Parmigiana. The meal came with 3 large Veal pieces all smothered in tasty sauce, cheese, and wrapped in prosciutto.

With a fantastic atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, and delicious Italian food, Buca di Beppo now has a great place in my heart. Can't wait to have a family outing here one day with my less than Italian family."}
{"text":"First time at this Buca restaurant, it qas a great experience. Came for my bday with family, a group of 7 totally (with 1 toddler). Food was great! We all shared 2 orders of the seafood sampler which was pretty good ( i usually dont like fried seafood), we also ordered the cheesy bread which was excellent. For dinner we ordered 3 main meals: (all large size) chicken cannaloni, eggplant parmesan and some stuffed chicken with pesto sauce. All was grear, but the stuffed chicken with pesto sauce was the best.  We split the brownie sundae, cannolis and raspberry cake for dessert. Our waitress was very nice and def worked hard for her tip. Thanks for making my bday awesome Buca!"}
{"text":"I was just here last weekend for a rehearsal dinner and I feel that we all had a great time.  The food was great and everyone was very accommodating considering we had 40-50 people.  The server on our end of the table was great (Mark or Mike??).  He had a great attitude with everyone and I'm sure that can be difficult when dealing with so many people!  I thought the entire staff did a great job accommodating such a large group of people!"}
{"text":"Wow, What a great dinner we had tonight! 

Walking in, we did not have very high expectations due to the location (inside the Excalibur). The host was friendly and welcoming when we first walked in. A manager was also standing at the host stand and warmly welcomed us. We were immediately seated at a comfortable table with good ambiance. 

Our server, Sherrae, came right over to the table and offered some specialty cocktails. She also suggested the bruschetta as a starter. Our drinks were delivered promptly. The bruschetta came to the table and we devoured it. It was beyond amazing. Fresh tomatoes and mozzarella were plentiful. 

Sherrae checked on our bruschetta to insure we were happy with her suggestion which we were! We then ordered our entree which is served family style so we shared a chicken Parmesan and a ravioli with marinara. The food came out to the table quickly and we were able to enjoy our meal. Sherrae really cares about going above and beyond to enhance the dining experience. We never once had to ask for anything. She anticipated our needs and she made sure that we had everything we needed. 

About 3/4 of the way through our meal, the manager, Raymond, stopped by our table to ask if we had everything we needed and if we were enjoying our food. Raymond was very pleasant and we really appreciated the fact that he took the time to stop by the table and check on everything. 

Overall, friendly and attentive staff and good, Americanized Italian food!"}
{"text":"I had never been to the Bucca in Las Vegas so my husband and I decided to try the one in the Excaliber casino and it was delicious. The wait staff was very nice and anticipated our every need. We didn't even have to ask for refills on our soda. The restuarant was very clean and our food was very fresh. Thank you for a great night out and we will definitely be in again."}
{"text":"I had never been to Buca di Beppo until very recently. I've heard a lot about it in the past, and much of what I've heard has been bad things. However, despite all the warnings, I still wanted to give this place at least one try. 

If you aren't familiar with Buca di Beppo, the main concept is that it offers \"family style meals\". This means that when you select something from the menu, the portion is enough for two or more people, from appetizers to salads to pastas. The Food is great and I had enough for left overs! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Horrible, not kid friendly pictures on the wall. Antipasto salad had a lot to be desired. Overpriced pasta. I'll pass."}
{"text":"used to go there a lot...lately not so much. decided to try it again as the salad and
pasta is usually pretty good.
this time...salad ..well...if you could get flavor out of the very tiny schredded items then maybe it could have been good...and if you could find the olives...
for almost 14 bucks..not worth it
the pasta with Maranara..horrible...sauce was watery and BITTER...like did you cook this??? not tasty at all
bread...what happened to the nice bread you could dip in olive oil and balsamic?
this stuff was like pizza dough with the worst chees and garlic spread...ugh..I love bread and I could barely down this...

the one star is for service which was very good..but the place was almost empty so why not?
very expensive for a salad and pasta meal
and almost 4 bucks for ice tea???? 
we wont go back"}
{"text":"Humongous tasty portions with excellent flavor. The staff is so attentive and like family. Eric came to sit with us like a long lost friend while checking on us to see if we needed anything else. Can't wait to come back. All of the leftovers we had after our meal will last us a while."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for my little sister's graduation quite some time ago. It was definitely an experience.

The parking was alright. It was in front. I just hate serving around Scottsdale since the streets are so narrow with my SUV near all these sportsters that are the size of Miatas. I feel like I'm going to crush a car underneath my tires.

The inside was clean. There was plenty of seating. It has a part that is like a walk through kitchen area. Kind of cool. There was a lot of pictures up.

My older sister said that this place serves family style so when we order...each order is meant to feed a family. The food came and it was no joke. It was enough to feed the six of us. Dessert was plentiful too. I left stuffed. 

I would come here again."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Wait staff was excellent. Atmosphere was nice. Food was moderately priced. I will certainly come back. It was a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Webs always had a good experience here. Staff are super friendly and the food is consistently Italian. Fun portions and enough to fill everyone up. My whole family has been here three times and so far we've had a good time.

We are extremely picky where service and menu are concerned. Fun place"}
{"text":"Updated 3/12/16...After Management reached out to us we decided to bring guests with us to give this Buca location another try. I am happy to say that Buca  redeemed themselves nicely. Our  server, Ashley, was spot on. Personality personified with everything we asked for served perfectly! The food was outstanding and our whole dining experience was 100% better than our last Buca fiasco. We'll go back again soon! Thanks Buca!! 

Previous review: Not up to par tonight... I'm afraid it was a one star meal. Brought out our pasta dish two minutes after we ordered it... Before the oil for the bread was poured, and before the salad... and more importantly... before our wine was served... and in addition, the wineglass had lipstick stains. When they brought us the same pasta dish they tried to serve from  1/2 hr previously, it was obviously fluffed up.......and cold. Tried to catch the mgr's eye and that was a no go!! The server got a minimal tip, and we won't be back for a long while. Tried to catch the mgr's eye and that was a no go! They need to get their act together! Not an auspicious start to our weekend! :-("}
{"text":"This place will not see our family again. I made a reservation for our family party of 12 in advance to celebrate our son's 13th birthday. I was completely prepared ahead of time. I arrived 15 beforehand with a handwritten list of food and wine to place the order before all the family arrived. When I handed over our Baskin Robbins ice cream cake I looked the server directly in the eye and told her to BE CERTAIN to place it in the freezer- not the fridge- as it is an ice cream cake. She laughed and said \"Absolutely, Of course!\"

I was disappointed to find that our party of 12 was seated in two separate tables right next to another family that had 3 toddlers. It was a Sunday night at 5pm and the restaurant was very empty. The toddlers next to us were absolutely screaming the entire time and we were not able to hear our family conversation. Surely they could've placed us with more space between us to make our evening more pleasant instead of what was easier for the server.

It took our waitress far too long to bring out my son's cake when we asked again. To my horror, the waitress delivered our half-melted ice cream cake and ran off as I said, \"Oh no! What happened?\"  No one stayed. They ran!! We tried to serve some of the middle that was a bit slushy, but it was ridiculous.  

The waitress emerged with our bill and said she took off our salad because they ruined our cake. The salad was $21. Our cake was $40!! No manager, no apology.

No chance anyone in my extended family will return. It was our first visit and definitely our last."}
{"text":"Not good! Doesn't matter how many coupons I get in the mail I'm not giving them anymore tries! 

Chicken is dry and chewy. 

Pasta is flavorless. 

Garbage."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  The salads are the only thing that remains consistently good at this chain.  The portions are also plenty that has still remained unscathed by father time.  

Bland is the only way I can describe the entire meal.  The marinara was terrible until I added salt and then VOILA! It was genius again.  The meatballs were the worst offenders of the bland bandits.  Not only were they full of NO flavor they were luke warm and smelled like canned dog food.  Worst thing on the table.

My husband ordered a new menu item that was laden in creme sauce and I can't remember the name of it because it was again, BORING! 

Sorry to say but the meal sucked.  The service was wonderful and that is what bumps up this joint to 2 stars!"}
{"text":"I had the fettucini supremo which had a beautiful presentation but was very bland. Chicken hadn't been seasoned, sauce had no flavor it was bad 

My kid enjoyed the pizza which tasted better than my fettucini. :/

Lastly the tiramisu.. it was missing the pudding like consistency and the lady fingers tasted like straight alcohol. No good.

The 3 stars is mostly for the very fun and friendly service we had.

I will only try this place again if someone else pays ."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and prices. Nice varied lunch menu. Prompt, friendly service. I believe our waitress' name was Paula and she had great energy and was fun to talk to! She checked on us frequently and was quite frankly the best waitress we had in our entire trip to Vegas! She was busting her butt at every table!!Highly recommended for a classy, inexpensive Italian lunch with top-notch service!"}
{"text":"I give this place four stars because the service can sometimes fluctuate depending on how busy the restaurant is, and how many people are in your party. The food is always delicious. My top go-to's are the Apple Gorgonzola Salad  and the Shrimp Fradiavolo, you can't go wrong with either. I recommend going in larger groups, as this is a family style restaurant, the portions are enourmous and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Not really impressed, but I did leave stuffed. The portions are quite large so good for a family on a budget. The Shrimp Fra Diavolo is a spicy penne dish which I would recommend. Daughter got the traditional baked ziti which she enjoyed. The Artichoke Florentine dip was tasty but cheesy, the bread that comes with it is tasty alone. House bread is nice and soft. The children's spaghetti is not good at all, stay away. Felt bad for my son, thank good he ate appetizers or he probably would of starved."}
{"text":"Great Service! Great food! Huge helpings! We ordered the baked ziti with the cheese toast and the sausage and peppers on the side. One order of everything and we were STUFFED! Delicious... thanks a bunch!!"}
{"text":"Liked the pizza. Hot. Crispy. Great fried mozzarella. Attentive bartender. Waitress checked on us only once. She wouldn't  come back to take additional drink orders.  The place wasn't that busy at the time. Looks like others had the same problem with the service."}
{"text":"The evening started out well. We were seated on time and had a decent booth in the back. There was another larger party right next to us so it was a little busy. We ordered the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni per suggestions on YELP. This dish was horrible. The chicken was dry and the sauce tasted like pasta water. There was no flavor to it at all. I was there with 2 other people and they had the same experience. We couldn't even eat it so we asked the waitress for extra marinara  sauce. This still did not help much but made it somewhat edible. On top of the bad dish the staff behind us was arguing with each other on who would get the next big table. I dont think as a chain resturant you should be discussing the next big table while customers are in the room."}
{"text":"I decided to eat dinner after this casual Italian restaurant, after driving past various locations of it several times. My veal was tough and hard to cut through. My lasagna was bland. A loud noise kept coming out of the ceiling above me. I was unimpressed and will not return."}
{"text":"So it's a restaurant chain. That doesn't matter to me I'm a fan. I admit that I don't ever eat at Buca unless I have a coupon, but come on they send them in the mail all of the time! I'm also signed up on the e-mail list so they send offers that way too. I received a $20 off with purchase of 2 entrees and wanted to take advantage of it since I hadn't had Buca in a while, and it was better then the $10 off they generally send.  

We arrived just after 5 pm. The parking lot was pretty empty and when we got inside we were able to have our pick of where to sit since they weren't busy. We must have just beat the dinner rush coming in because the restaurant soon filled up. Our server brought some complimentary bread that I had to force myself to put down to save room for my meal that was coming. I could have eaten the bread all to myself! Since Buca serves family style meals the portions are big. They have small and large sizes, but don't let the small size trick you into thinking it isn't much because it is plentiful. 

I ordered the \"Penne Arrabbiata\" priced at $19.99 for the small. It had spicy Italian sausage on top of the pasta as well in the sauce. I wasn't crazy about this dish simply because it had too much sausage flavor. I like sausage, but don't like it overpowering certain dishes. The sausage that was on the pasta also was a bit dry. The other dish I ordered was the \"Baked Lasagna\" priced at $19.99 for the small. This is so good! The meat sauce it tasty and the cheesy goodness it what makes it! There is ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan cheese in this lasagna. Very comforting and delicious! 

You can phone your order for pick-up if you don't feel like eating inside. Buca has several options as far as catering goes. You can pick up \"Party Pans\" (they have a menu for this) if you are having a gathering at your house and don't want the fuss of cooking. They offer different sizes and menu options broken down to how many people you are entertaining. They also offer a catering service where you can have Buca deliver the food along with tablecloths, plates, utensils, etc. so this is probably a great choice for a corporate party. They also have banquet rooms (some themed) and offer group menu options. When the server told me about the themed rooms I wondered what they could be like since there are pictures of naked people hanging on the regular dining walls. I crack up every time wondering how they get away with that since Buca is supposed to be a place to bring the familia, but it is just part of the character and I guess it works!"}
{"text":"Ordered family dinner, and it came without our orders of spaghetti and lasagna. Then, we were offered zero refills on our drinks. Then, we were told they couldnt charge our meals because their computers crashed. This while not being offered refills while we wait for them to get their system back up. Our server was absent-minded most of the evening, and just a terrible experience for my daughter's 21st birthday. They did comp the meal, but only after I complained to the manager (which I rarely do)."}
{"text":"It's not good. The food is really lackluster. Chicken parmigiana was tough and greasy, Spaghetti was stale and obviously from a box, sauce tasted like it was a week old. Wouldn't eat here again 

Service was timely and friendly but food was just not good."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, but you'll pay for it. We paid $11.99 each for single serving of lunch, but it didn't even come with bread! I've never heard of an Italian restaurant serving meals without bread! Every little thing costs extra here, like $5 for bread with your lasagna. It's pretty ridiculous, but a nice occasional splurge."}
{"text":"This is a family style type of place so don't be alarmed by the relatively high prices for each dish! The small is enough for about 2 people and the large is good enough for maybe 3-4 people. I tried the penne basilica, lasagna, caesar salad, and garlic bread. I would recommend getting everything, but the penne basilica because they gave way more pasta than chicken or broccoli (there was only 2-3 pieces). The garlic bread is worth getting because they put a generous amount of garlic on their bread and you get a whole basket! The downside is that it does not come with your meal and you have to pay $9.99. The atmosphere is pretty lively and they play lots of oldy kinda music. This place is really affordable and is really filling!"}
{"text":"If someone brings 17 people \"friends and family\" into a FAMILY STYLE restaurant, I would assume the staff would be competent enough to at least fill and bring a glass of water. Waiting 40 minutes for a glass of water is absurd. Asking for a glass of water 4 times is even more absurd. I had to ask my friend who was seated at the end of the table for a drink. Did they run out of water? It all started going down hill from there. It was quite embarrassing to bring my mother in law here and watch everyone eating their meal except her. They forgot her meal! They didn't forget to bring her food, they forgot to cook it! What? We were all done with our food when they brought her meal. This is a restaurant, you specialize in 2 things, drinks and food, can I at least get a drink?  Next the waiter brought our check minus the change, ??? Wait what? They ran out of change? This is what the waiter told us. Not sure what is going on with this joint? The only reason I am giving Buca 2 stars is because the food was exceptional. If you have a large group of more than 2 people I would not recommend this restaurant unless you want to make yourself look bad in front of your guests, I say this because I have been here on multiple occasions with just my wife. But the last 2 times I brought a group of people here it was a nightmare. Family style is not so family."}
{"text":"Good food but not spectacular to me.
Service was not great.  Server didn't bring bread.  Slow to refill drinks and bring/take ticket.  I audibly heard the server saying he was done with the shift so I imagine the lackluster effort was because of that 
Four stars for food but I took away one for bad service."}
{"text":"Dave m was Uhhhhh Mazing! Could his service be any more impeccable ? So friendly and attentive he was great. Always smiling and talking to our entire group keeping things fun. I wish more servers were like him and I say that because I am a server so I recognize great service!! This guy deserves a raise or a promotion. Bravo Dave you were awesome! Thanks for making our experience here so great. Also the food was good but the service even better"}
{"text":"We made an online reservation for a Friday night through their website. When we got there, the hostess told us they weren't accepting them online and there was an hour and a half wait. Complete BS. They just lost a few families business for life..."}
{"text":"Pros: always have coupons that you can just show on your phone,  friendly staff, free plain bread.
Cons: you can only order in larger quantities so if you have two people you will either be stuck eating the same thing or will have a high bill and leftovers. 

they walk you through the kitchen as a \"tour\" before you're seated.  Menu has variety but not any beef dishes besides veal so any pasta with meat is pork.  They won't let you choose not to have sausage cause I guess the food is already made.  That would explain why the taste is very average.  So it's not really a kitchen as much as it is a reheat/prep area.  I know most places don't make the food there but that's what I'd still prefer.  Or at least trick me and pretend you do."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. The food is mediocre and I prefer Johnny Carino's and Olive Garden over this place. It is always packed and the idea of family style is nice but there is nothing that I crave when I go there."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Buca Di Beppo's? The food here is unbelievable and the portions are enormous. I guess that's why you can only order the pasta plates for groups of 2 or 4. But in reality, there's prob enough food there for 4-6 people. The pasta is cooked very nicely and the sauces are delicious. This location was packed every time I went so I would suggest putting in a reservation during the dinner hours."}
{"text":"From what I can tell all the bad reviews are from people who didn't understand the concept of the restaurant or got bad service. If you don't come in a group don't expect the best service (not ideal for a date). This place really caters to large groups making large orders. Even their food is served this way (family style), which it seems like a lot of people didn't expect. I've been there twice in 2 different years and experienced great service and great food both times. The servers were accommodating of splitting checks as well, even with large parties involved. 

My favorite thing that I've had there was the penne a la vodka, mainly because most restaurants serve mediocre vodka sauce and this one actually holds up well against good ones. I was also a big fan of the chicken Parmesan, but if you mess that up at an Italian restaurant then you're not an Italian restaurant. The shrimp Florentine was also delicious, and my boyfriend who is a picky eater but loves shrimp ate multiple helpings of it and declared it amazing! 

Aside from those dishes my friends also enjoyed the prosciutto stuffed chicken, the fettuccine supreme, and a side of the brussel sprouts with prosciutto (which I tried and were fantastic). 

Touching again on their ability to cater to large groups in this section: I love this restaurant's atmosphere because it has little booths and rooms with big tables for parties. One of the times I was there they set aside a whole room for a party of 75(!!!!!!!!!) and I was amazed. I also like it because the wall is COVERED in old photographs and it's fun to look around every once in a while amidst enjoying food and company."}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery and they won't deliver without 24 hours notice. Salad was delicious and the garlic bread was fantastic. Ordered an Alfred rigatoni that was dry and under seasoned. Lemon chicken with capers were good. Not a lot of food for the price. Might be a different experience if you eat in."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Buca di Beppo for many years and I've always enjoyed their food.  Although I stopped coming after they removed one of my all-time favorite dishes (the tortellini).  It's hard to find any Italian restaurants that serve tortellini (especially good tortellini), so I'm still disappointed that they have not added it back to their menu since Planet Hollywood took over ownership.  However they still offer ravioli's, which are extremely good.  I also ordered the baked ziti & spaghetti.  I've had much better baked ziti, so I won't order that from here again, and I also made the mistake of ordering the plain Marmara spaghetti instead of the spaghetti with meat sauce.  Their marinara spaghetti is very bland but the spaghetti with meat sauce is much better.  
So in summary:
Ravioli- Excellent
Spaghetti with meat sauce- Great
Spaghetti with marinara- Bland, flavorless
Baked Ziti- I've had much better
Tortellini- Excellent (Please bring this dish back to the menu, PLEASE)"}
{"text":"Food was good. Drinks, way over priced. $8 for a tall glass of draft beer. Not even cold"}
{"text":"Jarrett, our waiter, is the coolest guy ever! God bless him and his future endeavors. He truly made my experience here worth while"}
{"text":"The meals are so great,  that I want to grow another stomach to keep consuming the heavenly meals.  The portions are big.  Great sangria too"}
{"text":"The customer service was ok but the food was less than spectacular. Not sure if I would come back but I truly wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"Food is meant to be shared here. It's served family style. The prices for menu items are meant to reflect 2-4 portions. However, they are small & may not feed the number of people advertised. On my first go, I ordered their eggplant parmesan. It was so delicious! I ordered a large for $32 so it was meant to serve 4 or more but it was 1.5 servings for me. There were 3 small stacks of eggplant. Maybe my senses of portion size is severely skewed? On another occasion, I ordered the large calamari for 2 people ($30, though meant for 4). It came out on a 6\" oval plate & was overcooked to little crisps. Totally not worth it. While some of the food is good, it is totally overpriced with small portions."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once on a date and once when my parents visited me last year.  I'd describe the fare as typical mediocre, chain-type Italian-style, except that the portioning is family-style (intended to be shared between 2-6 others).  The first time, I had the veggie lasagna, and the second time, I had the manicotti.  It's definitely filling, but not the most flavorful stuff I've ever eaten.  The meal comes with bread, and on my second trip, I ordered the cannoli, which was also solidly okay.  This is one of the less expensive options in Station Square, and it's a good place to take picky eaters (such as my folks), should you happen to be in the vicinity.  Needless to say, better-quality, more authentic Italian fare can be found elsewhere in PGH.

The decor is...interesting.  The menu explains that the name of the restaurant means \"Joe's basement,\" hence the copious bric-a-brac and lack of windows.  The bathroom is right next to the kitchen, so you can grab a peek at what's going on back there.  Service was decent on both visits."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group and was excited to have a good dinner, however that did not happen. 

First, half of our party was going to be late so we decided to put in an order of appetizers and order two bottles of wine for the table. Ten minutes later the rest of our party showed up.. Another five minutes our caprese appetizer came, then the wine a couple minutes after that. Finally after 10 more minutes we reminded our waitress about the garlic bread we ordered and only then did it come to the table. 

Then as the rest of the party was getting their drinks the waitress spilled a tray of three ice teas all over one of the women in my group and her purse. Since we were a big party and the waitress obviously messed up I thought it would be appropriate for her to offer to comp some of our drinks, this did not happen. 

Later, we were ordering all of our food and we decided to just split all of the entrees. Since I'm a vegetarian I decided I was going to order the gnocchi to be sure there was a dish I could eat, however our waitress informed me they were all out of the gnocchi that night. So not wanting to make a big deal about it I informed her I was vegetarian and since one of the dishes my party had already ordered was the Quattro al Forno (which included the Cheese Manicotti, Chicken Cannelloni, Baked Ravioli and Stuffed Shells), she explained that all were vegetarian except the chicken cannelloni. I hadn't really studied the menu so I trusted what she said and told her that i could get by on eating off of those plates. Fast forward to when we finally get our dinner, someone in my party advocated for me to get first pick at the plates \"without meat\" so I got a stuffed shell and some of the baked ravioli. After eating the baked ravioli i started chewing some of the stuffed shell and realized there was indeed meat in it. I quickly spit it out but couldn't believe there would be meat in the dish. When the waitress came back a member of my party asked the waitress again if there was meat in the stuffed shells and she said no. Then I spoke up and said there was and that I had tasted it. She responded that she would go check on that. She came back a few minutes later and told me what I already knew, that there was meat in the shells. She offered no real apology to me, did not offer to bring me out another dish or comp anything. 

I was so upset and felt so sick after that it really ruined the rest of my dinner and night, not to mention I have been vegetarian for six years and this waitress couldn't even offer me an apology for something that was clearly her mess up."}
{"text":"This was a last minute choice for dinner on a recent Friday night. The red sangria was mediocre at best. Glad I didn't go for the upsell to a carafe. The calamari was ok, I would give it a \"C\". Under seasoned, mostly tentacles, and served with a terrible sauce. It had a really \"tinny\" taste, like it came right from a can. I don't mind canned tomatoes, but I don't want to taste metal. Service was ok, not good. We noticed that every table but ours had bread, so we asked for some. We really shouldn't have had to ask. The lobster ravioli was odd. They were filled with a fishy puree and also had some larger chunks of lobster in them, and then covered with a terrible sauce. The seasonings were just weird and off, and again, the sauce tasted very metallic.  I went with a friend and she got \"that kind of sick\" about half an hour after we left and said she still felt sick  the next morning.  We both had exactly the same things, except for our beverages, and I didn't get sick. Our total for one sangria, two domestic beers, one calamari appetizer and one lobster ravioli entree was a little over $50 before the tip."}
{"text":"What a fabulous experience!  My family was seated at the Chef's Table and the kids got to make their own pizzas in the kitchen!!!!  The service was excellent and Jason the manager made the experience amazing for our kids.  The baked ziti was sooo good and the chicken Marsala was spot on.  Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, relaxing, \"you're part of the family\" atmosphere. Food is delicious. We always ask for Katie. She's our favorite server. We usually get pizza and salad. We are picky about our pizza and theirs always meet our high standards. The pepperoni they use is delicious and the crust is thin and crispy, just the way we like it! We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in this restaurant and my last.  So disappointed.  Got seated okay.  Although we knew it was family style we figured they would have a few items you could order individually if necessary.  Nope.  One person ordered an appetizer and it was $18 - no larger than a normal appetizer at another restaurant.  The portions were fine for pasta. We got the chicken carbonara and there would have been plenty for 3-4 people.  Priced around $25 for the small. We forced someone to take leftovers but I am sure they will be chucked in the bin.  So the food was meh ... the service - well there really wasn't any.  Once our food was served the waiter flew by not stopping and asked over his shoulder if everything was ok.  He didn't slow down to wait for our reply. We sat at the table and discussed our horrible experience for about 15 minutes with all our dirty plates after we finished eating before another person who worked there came over.  Got the check, failed to put our $20 off on it. More waiting.  Also When we ordered beers he didn't ask what size so we got the big ones (we would have ordered the small) - who knew they offered two sizes.  Overall for the price and experience if you want this type of food go to Olive Garden.   I don't know how they stay in business because it was pretty empty when we were there 6:00pm on a Thursday night. 
I know there are people who do love this chain - but it's not for me or the other family I was with."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in with very low expectations.  We realize that this is not fine Italian food, but what we encounter was not even good enough to meet our already low expectations. 
First, we ordered a calamari appetizer and a bottle of wine. The problem started when our food was delivered before the wine. I mean, we finished the calamari and no sign of the wine. By the time the waiter (paolo) brought the wine, it was a little too late to enjoy it. I told the waiter that we would take 2 glasses instead of the complete bottle.
After a few minutes the food came. It was a spicy pasta with chicken. Unfortunately,  the sauce tasted like sea food.  It was truly bad!
The place is crowded,  the food is below average and the service is just as bad...find another restaurant. You will be happier going to an olive garden, macaroni grill or any other chain restaurant.
Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's not the most original, the most swanky, or even the best Italian food. But here's why I love it:

No matter the occasion, no matter your mood, you walk into Buca and feel great. The Old World music, the ecclectic wall decor, the smells, and all of the loud-but-happy people. It really has an infectious atmosphere all its own.

This is THE place for a group, as the portions at Buca Di Beppo's are HUGE! Plan to order a variety of dishes and pass them around the table. Also give the homemade lemoncello a try. Delizioso!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food that wasn't spectacular. Enjoyed the experience for what it's worth. Thank God I had some coupons to supplement the lack of value lol"}
{"text":"We love bocas great service clean and lots of seating. Right next to the mall. Honestly one of the best Italian places I've been to in Cleveland large portions even when you ordered smalls. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I'm not really going to go into a lot of detail on the food as Buca di Beppo is a pretty large chain of restaurants.  It'd be tantamount to reviewing a hamburger from McDonalds, as if it would be different from that of any other McDonalds in the US.  The distinguishing factor between Buca locations will largely be service.  However I will say that Buca has kind of \"sold out\" in the past 10 years and the quality has noticeably gone downhill as they've expanded. 

I went with a friend around 5 PM on a Sunday and surprisingly they were not at all busy.  We were seated immediately and we were asked if we had been there before.  I said yes and then the server went into a spiel about explaining how big the dishes were and we could even order from the lunch menu if we wanted.  OK, why ask if we had been there before if you're going to explain the dishes are huge and feed multiple people?  Anyway, the server took our drink order.  Then a completely different server came over and asked what drinks we wanted.  I explained we were already taken care of before and he asked if we had been there before.  After saying yes he started explaining the sizes of the dishes again.  Are you kidding me?  Thankfully while he was going through the exact same speech we got our drinks from the first server and he left.  

Anyway I won't bore you with the details of the food.  It's above average Italian chain food.  Better than Fazoli's, not as good as Olive Garden.  Service was of average speed.  I had to wait a bit too long for a drink refill, especially considering they had only a couple of other customers.  

Where this experience went horribly wrong was the end of the meal.  We were visibly done and had placed all the plates at the edge of the table and nobody came over to give the check or collect the plates despite passing by several times.  OK.  Eventually a server came over and cleaned up, and asked if we wanted the remainder of the food in to go boxes.  I said yes and asked for the check as well.  He took two dishes to the back to box up, came back and put the remainder of the mashed potatoes on a piece of chicken after asking if it was OK to combine the two in the same box.  I said sure and he put them together, saying there would be no way he could eat that after the two foods had touched.  OK I'm not sure why you felt the need to tell me that, but whatever.  Still no check.

Eventually after both my friend and I were standing up and waiting to leave and waiting for another couple of minutes, I went to the bartender to ask him if we could get the check.  He ran off, came back a bit later and said it was on the way.  After waiting another few minutes I went all the way out to the front where there were 3 staff members and practically begged someone to bring the check so we could leave.  Finally a few minutes after that I got the check but it was wrong.  It took another few minutes to correct and finally we could leave.  

An absolute failure with respect to service in every way.  If they mess up so badly on a party of 2 when they aren't busy, I can only imagine how bad it would be with a large group, if they were busy, or both."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo has fairly affordable comfort food that comes in very generous portions. The restaurant was very nice. The decor of the place gave off a home, cozy atmosphere. 

The service was really good and the food came out faster than I expected it to, which is always great! This is a great place to eat with for families because you can have family styled dinner and share plates with each other.

I wasn't a fan of the sangria. It tasted like someone mixed orange juice and threw in some fruit chunks."}
{"text":"Recently move real close to this place and was excited to try it. Really like it on first impression. It is a neat looking place with a good feel to it. 

We were seated and waited an extremely long time to even see our server. Although we were ready to order our server took only our drink order and ran away to put in our drink order. Our drink order was simply a bottle of wine. We didn't see her again to place our order for another 5 minutes. 

So we order the lasagna with garlic bread and soup. The soup arrives just barely warm with the complementary bread which wasn't even warm. 

Finished the soup and started waiting for the meal. Oh did I mention the wine still had not arrived. I guess the bar was backed up oh wait it was a bottle of wine. 

I try not to completely judge a place based on one server. So the food arrived and it was bland. 

Food wasn't great and bad service but that could be a one time thing but on the way out in the foyer there were two employees across from each other having a discussion. We passed between them and out the doors. They simply continued their discussion without so much as acknowledging the departing customers. 

So it wasn't and individual server having a bad night. This is obviously poor management."}
{"text":"I was parked at Station Square after the EQT Ten Miler so we decided we'd try a restaurant in there that would be toddler friendly.  
When we entered the restaurant it took them a few minutes to figure out where to seat us.  This was fairly puzzling because when we were walking through the restaurant it seemed mostly empty.  We were seated in a small side room on the top floor.  I'm glad there was an elevator because without it would have been a chore to get the kids up the stairs.
I hadn't been to a Buca di Beppo in at least 20 years so I forgot that all of their entrees were served family style.  Our server did explain this to us and also talked about how many people were typically served with each menu choice.  She explained what some of the favorite menu items tend to be and was very helpful in picking out items.  She also encouraged us to just order one kids meal which we definitely appreciated because the kids meal portions were huge.  I see that a lot of people complain about service, but our server was attentive and helpful.
We had the Mozzarella Garlic bread to start.  It was very tasty, but a bit over priced at $9.  
Our entrees were Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken and Shrimp Fra Diavolo.  The kids had the macaroni and cheese.  We really loved the chicken.  It came with four substantially sized pieces of chicken.  It was flavorful and had a nice amount of sauce.  The shrimp fra diavolo was simply \"meh\"  The shrimp were small and kind of rubbery and although the sauce was spicy, it didn't have much flavor other than spice.  
My husband and I each ordered an alcoholic drink and the kids each had a milk.  Our bill was over $100.  We did get a lot of food for that amount, but I definitely would have preferred a higher quality meal with smaller portions for the same price.
We probably won't be back unless we go with a party of four and are able to split the same entrees we enjoyed but also split the bill."}
{"text":"Compared to the one in Seattle, well, can't really compare it.  Reviews for this chain are all over the map, so I guess it depends on the location and reviewer.

Portions here are just as huge as they are at every other location, and for me, that isn't a plus.  I'm not a fan of leftovers, and I know going in that no matter what I order, I'm taking some home.  I came here with my grandma and her friend, who are in their 80's and don't eat much.  I think we left with more food then we ordered.

The layout of this location is insane.  It's a seemingly never ending maze of rooms, hallways, and passageways.  It was also loud and there was a baby crying somewhere near our table, but due to the layout, I was never able to pin down exactly where.

Service wasn't anything great, and I got the impression that she was getting towards the end of her shift and wanted to go home.

I'm glad I live near Seattle, so if I'm feeling the need for some huge portions of Italian food, I can hit the one downtown."}
{"text":"Food is a little too salty overall. Waiter service is just ok. I usually tip well, but with my server I almost wanted to leave zero because they kept trying to get me order more food than I actually needed and barely checked on my table, and I ended up getting no refills. I will probably come back for the food. surely not to this location though."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Buca di Beppo locations in several cities.  They are a good place to go with a large group.  We went to this location with a group of nine.  The menu was typical.  We ordered the seafood trio, which was nice, and the fried mozzarella, which was also good.  The Caesar's salad was also good.  We ordered pasta entree's and chicken, all of which were served up warm and in plentiful portions.  We left with a fair amount of food.  I would give the food four stars.  However, I would give the service one star.  Two in our party ordered cocktails.  Five of us ordered wine with dinner.  All drinks arrived together with our entrees.  We did not get enough dinner plates.  We did not get enough wine glasses, and had to wait for three more.  Three entrees arrived together, and we had to wait about five minutes for the fourth to arrive.  We had to ask three times for boxes to put our leftovers in.  We were never asked if we wanted dessert.  If the service were spot on, the rating would be much higher, but, I can't justify it."}
{"text":"Ok so it is Italian food, and part of a national chain.  They serve family style.  Over the years, their menu has changed, with more emphasis on pasta dishes.  Appetizers and salads are good.  Entrees are good, but the lack of good side dishes is a nuisance.  Portions are generous, prices are going up with time.  Service was good, attentive.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"When here for Mother's Day, the food was okay and they did not bring any bread to the table?  What kind of Italian restaurant does not give bread?"}
{"text":"First and only time we will eat at these stores/chain. 1) food quality is awful. Dry. Tasteless. Just downright nasty. 2) the decor of the store is horrendous. Worse than the food. It looks like a New Jersey yardsale threw up inside. 3) service was OK but no one can hear anything when the birthday chant is screaming out at 100 decibels. 4) ick. 5) our tab for 'small' plates and a bottle of $10 Chianti was $123.  And we ordered a salad, veal parm (toughest veal ive EVER eaten) and a pasta side. Ridiculous!!  We felt like someone robbed us. 6). Hideous. Dont spend your money in this chain. Nastier than Olive Garden, and THAT is tough to accomplish."}
{"text":"Nice place for a casual date! 

The penne al forno was good, but the garlic bread and spicy rigatoni with chicken were very excellent! 

The service was also consistently good. 

Recommend!"}
{"text":"The wait to be seated at Cheesecake Factory was over an hour, so we walked across the parking lot and were seated immediately. Like other reviewers, the food was really good and lots of it, the service was mediocre, slow and didn't bring bread for a while and water glasses ended up drained, etc. But we enjoyed it very much anyway because we weren't in a hurry. Good food and no wait for a party of 8."}
{"text":"I feel bad for rating this restaurant 3 stars, but they just didn't live up to the hype. The only part of our experience that deserved 5 stars were our servers, who were great, fast, friendly and knowledgable of their menu. Their portions are HUGE and are meant for sharing between 2-4 people. The flavor of the food however, was mediocre.. I'd even say subpar. I was expecting the mozzarella caprese to be made with balsamic vinegar, but instead it was only drizzled with olive oil, so it tasted very plain. Also beware, if adding sun-dried tomatoes to your \"build your own\" entree, because there was an ABUNDANCE of them in our spaghetti.. I kept having to either spit them out of every bite I took, or fish them out on my plate. It was definitely overkill. I'd suggest ordering them on the side."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful customer service and food! There was a super belligerent and unpleasant man eating there and the staff there handled the situation very professionally"}
{"text":"It's okay.  It's a fun place to hang out with friends, get a beverage, and maybe order pizza or pasta (or better yet, the salads are best, in my opinion).  Not evenly good.  I have given it lots of chances, and the consistency is a bit questionable. Also, fairly pricey. But where else can you get such a fun environment with kitschy photos and a comfortable seat in a diner?"}
{"text":"Buca's is a great place to go with a group or family. Their plates are large portions so it is good to share. If your group is comfortable with each other like ours was, you can pass each of the dishes around the table and get a sample of everything!

This being said, none of the food stands out as spectacular, just your tastier than average Italian-American pasta place. I tend to order the Apple Gorgonzola salad because it is a perfect mix of flavors. The spicy Rigatoni was the table's favorite of the dishes. We also ordered the lasagna, fettuccine alfredo, and prosciutto-stuffed chicken."}
{"text":"Despite my negative first experience here, I found myself back recently and we actually enjoyed dining here. Service was much better and more professional (for both lunch and dinner), if only just a bit slow afterward for getting the check. Food was not half bad either. Meatballs were on the big side (then again, so was everything else), but very hearty, especially with the marinara sauce. We really liked the make-your-own combination pasta, which allowed us to customize everything from the pasta to the sauce to the meat and vegetables. With up to three veggies and a meat, it was a pretty filling meal, even with the small size for two people. The marinara was a bit watery when we got this, but that was the only negative that we found."}
{"text":"On Saturday September 2nd my family and I decided to go eat here. Now if you have eaten here before you already know the bill is going to be well over $100 if appetites are packed, but the food is so good and the portions are so large it is considered money well spent. Staff was great. Although our Sangria was  watered down,the replacement was satisfactory. Some portions of the $27 appetizer were either under or over cooked. Main dishes were good. However, when my aunt and I made our way to the ladies room we were left completely and utterly disturbed. Now we all know that public restrooms are always in question as far as cleanliness, but their restroom made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up! Not only was it poorly maintained, The toilet seats look like acid is eating away at them.  Water pressure so low that it not only leaves previous toilet paper stuck to the  bowl but also the previous persons defecation. 1st stall. GROSS!. 2nd stall OMG!!. 3rd stall SERIOUSLY!!! I doubled back to the 1st stall mad because I needed to go and had no other choice. Before I knew it my aunt too realized the madness and was waiting to use the stall that I was in. As we were walking out my level of being confounded grew. I turned around, went back inside, and asked for  a manager. Apologetic, yes, sympathetic, no, I felt his words were just that ... words coming out of his mouth. There was no true embarrassment and certainly no remorse. I left feeling like either he has heard this before  enough so to be numb to the fact or he simply didn't care of my opinion. Well at least not enough to rectify it! $145 spent and my feelings are now Bucca Who?"}
{"text":"Very poor service for an expensive meal!  Portions are small for what they say feeds 2 or more.  Waited forever for service.  Was not offered bread, had to ask.  Food was not what I am accustomed to at our local Italian place.  Very below par.  Do not get calamari, rubbery and again small portion for $10.99.  Oh yeah, the place is filthy!  Skip this one!  Better off saving a few bucks and enjoying your meal at Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Was going to give this location 1 star for the unacceptable service we received from an employee named Kelly. Most rude, disrespectful customer service I've ever experienced. There was another worker as well who saw me come in and literally just walked away. Disappointed I didn't catch his name. We ended up waiting forever for our food, and Kelly was blatantly rude the whole time rolling her eyes, had no sense of customer service or accommodation. However, because the food was delicious and the manager did everything he could to make the situation right for us, we'd give this place a try again. We really enjoy the shrimp fra diavolo here- has to be one of their best pastas. so we were pretty disappointed in the service we received , because we are avid customers of Buca di Beppo from Ca to Az"}
{"text":"We visit this location quite frequently and purposely sit at the bar where the bartender Fallon is the best. She is super knowledgeable and remembers our drinks and food order. She makes us feel at home is one of the many reasons we come back quite often."}
{"text":"I ate here today with my friend while we were in Vegas stopping on a cross country move.  It was my first time here and my friend's first time ever at Buca's.  Our host and server Quincy gave the perfect aggressive hospitality service!"}
{"text":"My soon to be hubby had his work holiday  dinner here. There were about 15 of us and they seated us without everyone being present which I thought was nice since some places are strict about that. 

The decor is odd and slightly off putting, it's overdone and strange at times. We were seated in the Pope room, which you can guess is decorated with Pope memorabilia. There was a giant Pope head enclosed in glass in the middle of our table on a lazy Susan. Strange/odd/bizzare are the best words to describe it. 

Food, let me just preface this by saying I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it because it's hard to find good Italian at a decent price in this city. Heck it's even hard to find decent Italian at a higher price in this city. The food was bland, and it made me sad. I honestly don't remember what we ordered because it was one of those meals you easily forget. 

One star for service 
One star for price"}
{"text":"Rehearsal dinner for my sister's wedding was here. We had an upstairs room reserved. Somehow me and my running buddy got pushed into a corner not seated with anyone else. The waitresses said we'd have to share with another table, two tables and several children away. As in share food. 
I was like why can't we just have a smaller plate for our table? Oh we only do family style. What about a two person family? 

It was really irritating.

Food itself?
Eggplant Parm was good.
Spaghetti........eh. Really their sauce is bland and sorry. 
Cannoli? not the best I've had but not the worst either.

I understand my sister was trying to feed lots of people as cheaply as possible but being told I had to share food with another table and keep getting up, dodging amateur photographers and seeing if they're done wiht that platter yet can we get any food............ I wasn't digging it. and I wasn't digging finding the hidden bathroom on the second floor either. 

So much better food elsewhere and you don't have to pay to park for the tourist trap that is station square."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. No refills took 45 min for a large bowl of pasta which tasted like store bought pasta with Ragu sauce. This place makes Olive Garden taste authentic."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences of my life. I've never been so disrespected by staff and management as I have here. Steer clear!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time going to this place and I was pleasantly surprised!! From reading previous reviews I was a little nervous since I was planning to throw a surprise dinner party for my boyfriend. Right away, we were greeted and they lead us up stairs to a private room (the Pope room I believe). Since we had a large group we had two servers which was nice! The food was absolutely amazing! Large portions which was fun since we could share our dishes with each other. 

Overall, Buca is a great place with delicious food! I would definitely go back again.!"}
{"text":"This place leads you to believe that it is authentic immigrant Italian food and it does not come close.

First, the bread is dense, mushy, cold, white bread . . . much like Wonder Bread. The garlic bread is even worse, just very greasy white bread that made my Italian husband feel sick after only one piece. The olive oil is old and bordering on rancid. 

The salad is disappointing but edible. 

The shrimp florentine was tasteless, and the shrimp appeared to be seared (but not cooked through enough) on a flat grill in some mystery grease. There was a foul taste and odor on the shrimp that seemed like spent oil from the deep fryer, or even worse -- could it be meat fat? (caution vegetarians!) There was some cheap tasteless oil and no sign of sautéed garlic to give it some taste. I tried squeezing the lemon from my drink and grinding some pepper on it, but it was beyond hope. If I wasn't very hungry and in a hurry, I would have sent it back. 

My husband had a small personal plain cheese pizza and was charged more than what you would pay for a large cheese pie at any quality pizzeria. He said it was terrible. The cheese was awful and there was too much of it. Again, we were very hungry and running out of time so we just ate what we could and let them throw out the rest. 

There is nothing Italian about this place. If you are accustomed to good authentic Italian food this place will assault your tastebuds, drain your wallet, and argue that they are serving authentic immigrant Italian food and you don't know what authentic and quality is. Don't waste your breath trying to give constructive criticism-- they can't handle it and won't act on it. 

Create Your Own Pasta - tasteless sauce, chosen components missing, pasta glued together. POOR

Eggplant Parmigiana - it's not parmigiana - diced tomatoes instead of sauce, a small amount of lousy cheese, tasteless. POOR

Eggplant Parmigiana - after asking for sauce and cheese without the diced tomatoes - not much better. It's clear that they cannot produce a decent marinara sauce. POOR

Desserts: huge, overpriced, unimpressive. 

We've tried to like this place because the waitstaff in the bar area (Matt) was great but after being grossly overcharged for huge portions of poorly made food that is just somewhat edible and not enjoyable, we give up."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for awhile and decided to try this place out again. Tried the spicy chicken rigatoni and it was great!  As always, this place delivers on large portions and is a great place to come with friends to share the food with."}
{"text":"What I like is that all food is shareable! Large portions and great menu selection .. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a fantastic meal! Great service.  Sat in the bar and left stuffed. Portions are family style."}
{"text":"So you e-mail me a coupon for 50% off any pizza on \"National Pizza Day\". I go place an order for a couple pies at 6:30 pm but am told that you ran out of pizza! You mean that you did not plan ahead and have enough supplies on hand? Don't bother sending me any more of your meaningless coupons. I will go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the most fun places to eat in Charlotte, especially if you can snag the kitchen table. It's a kitschy, tacky, wild and funky place, and the food is huge, plentiful, and delicious. The prices aren't bad, either. 

I like the family-style service, although it's easy to over-indulge because everything is so good and so in your face. 

It can get a little busy, so sometimes the servers seem a little overwhelmed. The food can take a while to come out, so although the atmosphere would be great for kids, if your little kidlet is impatient, I would recommend finding somewhere else to go on busy evenings. 

They also offer curbside service if you aren't feeling the atmosphere, so order ahead of time, and they'll bring it out to you."}
{"text":"Recently came here for dinner I can't think of any other place that would compare to this. The atmosphere was fantastic and the service was top notch, server was attentive and friendly and very accommodating. I had the spaghetti and meatballs which was hands down the best I've had. The servings are big enough to share and it was so delicious that we had no left overs. My compliments to the chef of this place, keep up the good work! We will come again and next time I'll the lasagna so chef make it a good one!"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience ordering online for me family-had a 10% coupon and a $10 gift card. When I placed the pre-order it took my discount 10% off and rejected my $10 gift card saying the numbers were incorrect! I figured when I checked the box \"pay in restaurant\" I can straighten out my gift card with manager. I didn't realize I got charged already!
 I went in on 12/31st gave my prnit out of my online order to Cindy who was very nice and helpful. The manager came honored my gift card for $10! I was happy! Food was good bit on the pricey side but it is new year we are celebrating. When I checked my account I noticed I was charged for my online order and also when I picked up my order:( I called back talk to Cindy who said it is only pending they voided that online order so it should be okay now. Well, it is not okay both was charged and Joe the manager suppose yo call me back yesterday but didn't. 
My husband and I drove to Buca di Pepo Summerlin asking for the manager Joe he wasn't in. Zack the other manager was in but he couldn't d anything except told me he has to get in touch with GM and Corporate to resolve my issues! WHAAAT? The double charge is on there computer clearly I have my bank statement printed out showing the charges what is the problem? Joe manager called me back at 3:00pm found my online order on his computer sending it into corporate to get my credit it may take 3-5 business days?? Buca di Pepo has my $60.37 since 12/31 4 days now and they let me wait another 3-5 business days??? Lousy customer service, bad website, after several phone call and personal appearance  I'm super disappointed by the lack of decision making of the managers at Buca! Walmart gives me my money back the same day I expected a much better service from a HIGH END restaurant like Buca di Pepo! Who knows how long before I see my money back to my credit card???Shame on you!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food so I don't mind paying the extra dollar for great quality. We ordered the cheese spinach bread that was $14 which was NOT worth it all. Then are entrees came in which was much smaller than I thought. Our bill came up to about $60 including a qpon from groupon. First and definitely the last time coming here. I'd suggest to do Olive Garden or Red Lobster instead."}
{"text":"I was there with my wife and some friends for my wife's birthday.  The two of us just ordered a  drink each. The two drinks on my tab came out to $40.00. The drinks were $16.00 each and the waitress decided to add $6.00 gratuity.  $40.00 for 2 drinks? REALLY? I live in Santa Clarita Ca. And visit that location many times but if that restaurant corporation is OK with ripping off customers then I will no longer go to any of their locations."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my brother and my husband's birthdays.  We will never pick this place again.  The service was SO slow and the food was mediocre at best.  We only had 1 red crunched pepper between 9 people.  The jar was passed back and forth throughout the dinner.

Supremo Italiano - It was only thing good from this dinner but not the BEST pizza   (spicy Italian sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella, provolone and meat sauce)

Chicken & Sausage Ziti - This dish was so watered down.  Tasteless!  HORRIBLE.  (chicken breast, mild Italian sausage, red onions, roma tomatoes and spinach in garlic cream sauce)

Linguine Frutti di Mare - This dish was ok.  (shrimp, baby clams, mussels and calamari in spicy red clam sauce)

Spaghetti with Meatballs - This was another tasteless dish.  The meatballs was horrific.  The meat was low grade and after eating it, I lost my appetite.  I don't think it was meat at all.  YUCK!

We waited 45 mins for tasteless dishes.....   And spend a couple hundred of dollars."}
{"text":"The restaurant can get pretty loud and it is big inside, seemingly with a labyrinth of dining rooms to dine in. Service was friendly but they did run out of the house wine we were drinking and were limited on other choices that they had in stock. I have no idea who would want to sit in the kitchen but the option is there if you should choose to try it.

To summarize:

*Vegetarian options: the eggplant parmesan was very good. The eggplant was not soggy, fried correctly and sauce accompanying it tasted homemade.
*Spaghetti and Meatballs-Al dente but I was told the meatballs lacked substantial flavor.
*Chicken Carbonara-very good, creamy and you won't be able to stop eating it!
*Traditional wicker basket chianti was very good, smooth and fruity!"}
{"text":"Apple Gorgonzola salad was very good. Much small than the portion given in NYC and Atlantic City, NJ 
The cheesecake tasted old and dried out, but the raspberry sauce was spot on. 
Service was just okay and they certainly were not busy. 
Won't be going back  and we love Buca."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The prices are bit higher since it is located inside Excalibur, but it's fair given that you don't need to go out. The staff and yummy food (including vegetarian options) make it totally worth the money. plus he portion sizes are generous. Love it and highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Yes. 5 stars for making my lunch wedding reception so memorable and awesome! I had an early wedding ceremony in Treasure Island Hotel and my first choice of reception place is the Maggiano's. However, the booking rep there did not realized that the room I have been eyeing for a while now, signed a contract, has been booked months ahead and only advised me a month before my actual wedding day. I know, what a mess. So I contacted this branch and the sales coordinator, Ms. Shelby Hellweg immediately responded to my inquiry. On February, she sent me the banquet prices and it was really affordable. At first we are looking for less than 30 guests so she gave us the smallest room and provided some ideas. Signed the contract and she asked us if we have anymore questions. 

At the very last minute, we did not realize that we will be having more guests so we needed to amend the contract. She made it ALL STRESS FREE for me and my husband! =) She reserved us the EGGPLANT room w/c can accommodate up to 72 guests. In the end it all worked out. 

She was really easy to talk to and responded to our non stop emails in less than 24 hours. When we finally met her in person (the day before our wedding reception), she showed us the semi-private room, dropped of our table arrangements and she made sure that she will take care of everything. 

RECEPTION DAY:
-- Ample parking space!!!!
-- Guests came in really early but the manager and the servers accommodated them right away. Drinks and food came in just in time. Servings are huge (family style) and lots of leftovers and allowed us to bring everything home. They assisted us in neatly packing the leftovers and even gave us some containers for our wedding cake and cupcakes. 

We didn't feel rushed and everything went smoothly. The guests had so much fun and I was glad we were treated well here. I am recommending this place for wedding reception on a budget. The food is awesome for sure and the servers were awesome. Forgot their names.  

Days after my wedding, I left our wedding champagne glasses and Shelby was kind enough to call me and notify us that she's willing to ship it back to us for free. They are really great here!"}
{"text":"Came here for some good Italian food, but I'd rather have went to Olive Garden. Customer service was okay and the environment was cool, but the food was WAY over priced then it should've been. The food did not even taste all that good and left a bad after-taste in my mouth. Paid $36 for a family sized plate of chicken saltimbocca to feed 5 people.. it was only 5 pieces of chicken which I ate 3 with no problem.. $10 bread tasted like graham crackers with cheese melted on them. Honestly, won't be coming back any time soon. ~"}
{"text":"Buca is one of my go to Italian places for take out. It's a chain so the food is consistent, but feel more attention could be placed in their parking lot. Sucks to have to park outside of the restaurant parking lot when they have curb side parking, and one of the two spots is taken by their unoccupied catering car."}
{"text":"Ok so i had always wanted to try this place but never got around to it, until last weekend I went for our company dinner. 

It was a very different environment then i had thought. Place was crowded filled with large party's we were one of many parties there. It took us about 20 mins to get our table, services was a lil slow but there were like 25 of us. We started with salads we got this Apple Walnut salad it was sooo delicious it was served with cheese bread also very good. When we got our main food it was family style huge bowls and plates big portions. We got the spaghetti, also raviolis, as well as lasagna and a couple other plates pretty good food wasn't the best Italian Ive had but it was still pretty good. After getting completely stuff the ordered dessert omg best part of the meal, they ordered Strawberry Cheese Cake , Tiramisu , and the Colossal Brownie Sunday i had the Tiramisu which is one of my favorite desserts of all time and by far one of the best Tiramisu I have tasted delicious!!! 

Over all had a great time, this place is great for big parties and they have good food and a great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"It was good. Not great, food portions wonderful, staff good. Had a coupon. :) Not a bad choice for a night out. Great cocktails."}
{"text":"The service at this location is poor at best, the décor of the place is tacky and flat out disgusting to say the least. If you make the mistake of eating there try not to be unlucky enough to sit at the \"Chefs Table\" in the kitchen as there is nothing \"chef\" about the place. Not only will they irritate the hell out of you by showing you EVERY sad dish that comes off the nasty, dirty line, you'll get the pleasure of seeing employees texting and walking around with mouthfuls of food while they bash the customers. Back to the line, I know it's common to scrub and clean at the end of the service times but seeing old trash and food that has obviously been sitting on the floor for days that has been smeared into the tile is enough for me. Stay away, far away. You can find better, fresher Italian food in the ethnic food aisle at your nearest Giant Eagle."}
{"text":"Found a hair in our pitcher of sangria. Our waiter never even apologized. Then never came back to check on us. Worst service I've experienced at a high end restaurant. Never again"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and spent almost 40 minutes before getting served my soup and salad...

Soup, and salad.

They weren't even very busy but there didn't seem to be enough staff to handle everyone that was there. Also I was disappointed that they don't have the soup salad and half sandwich combo they've always had in the past. All the rest of their menu is pretty expensive for lunch. I really don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Management has reached out to me extended me an offer to make this right.. will be taking my mom back there hopefully.. Thank you for following up."}
{"text":"What a great experience our family had at this location. Our table was reserved and ready when we arrived, on a busy weekend-sold out status, and we were a large group of 22. Our servers were quick, listened to special requests, didn't miss a beat.  Portions were very ample, great taste, and never were we ignored. Best part was dessert....  Entire crew came over to sing Happy Birthday and brought candelabras and 3-humongous brownie&ice cream sundaes with oversized cupcakes for all to enjoy!!!!  Well done. Thank you again for making another family event very successful."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and sweet! From the minute we walked through the door we were greeted nonstop. We sat down immediately on a Saturday night. The experience was exciting for our kids. Our waitress Megan was super sweet. We ordered a few items that weren't available and the manager Shauntelle was so apologetic that she offered to replace it on her. The food is family style. And you already know what to expect. It's good enough for the price, not fancy, but consistent. Perfect atmosphere for a family with 3 children. I highly value good customer service. We will be more than happy to bring our family back to this restaurant! Thanks for your excellent service !!"}
{"text":"1 meal serves 2!! Very generous portion! Prices are reasonable. ..you pay for what you get...Delicious!!

Service was fast. Waiter was really friendly and accommodating.  Unique / relaxing ambiance"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! The Bartender who turned out to be our server took forever with drinks, didn't get silverware until 15 minutes after we had been there, cold food, and more excuses then should be allowed by a server at one table. Spent well over 300 hundred and will NEVER go back. Will definitely tell friends and family to head to another restaurant but BEWARE of this place!"}
{"text":"I went here several years ago and, although I loved the atmosphere, the food was so bad I swore to never go back. When my friends were adamant about meeting here recently though, I grudgingly decided to try it again. The food was greatly improved and the decor was as fascinating as ever. As has been mentioned here before, the acoustics aren't very good so when it's packed, you have to yell to hear one another. But, they do still let you go thru the kitchen and even have a table in there for those who want to eat in it so I gotta give them kudos for that. The only real problem we had this time was that our server was super slow in getting to us and kept forgetting a plate for me because he thought there were 6 of us vs. the actual 7. He took so long one time, I got my own plate from a nearby stack and my friend went up to the bar herself to get her drink. He finally started getting better about making time for us after that though and even brought her out a humungous birthday dessert that we all shared while enjoying their singing. After this new experience, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I actually like this Buca better than the one in Summerlin. It's all open space which gives it that family style feel. Of course the portions are served family style which feeds 3 or more people (so order accordingly! It's very easy to over order!). Our group ordered the stuffed chicken and the fettuccine supremo. This way more than enough for light eaters in a group of four. The stuffed chicken is AMAZING which I would suggest to any person who decides to come here. It has a great crunchy outer breading and inside the chicken is super tender and full of flavor in addition to the ham and the creamed filling. Super delish! The fettuccine supremo was also good. What you would expect of a typical pasta. The sauce was thick and creamy and filled with helpings of bell peppers and sausage.

They also offer happy hour which is $2 domestic, $3 imports, $5 glass of wine and specialty drinks at the bar only. Their house wine is ok. They offer a sample tasting of it, but honestly, it's a little boring and dry to me. I opted for their moscato instead which was light and sweet. Service was also ok. Our server was attentive as he could be in a busy restaurant, but he did satisfy all of our needs."}
{"text":"I'd like to thank them for being able to fit a party of 25 people on Christmas day after another restaurant canceled on us without any notice. I love that everything is family style. It makes it really easy for a big family like that to order and be able to try a little bit of everything. The service was really good, the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it was really cold in the restaurant, which may or may not have been the reason for the food coming out slightly cold and then also our order of gnocchi wasn't cooked all the way and was more of a dough ball, but it still tasted good :)"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the service. The bread was stale, the salad was decent, the Alfredo was bland and the chicken part was hard and chewy. I think that I got leftovers from the weekend. When I pay almost $20 for the meal, I would at least hope the food was fresh. 

But the waiter Kip was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Bucca's and never had any issues with the food or service. This was our first visit to this location and it was on Valentine's Day. Kids wanted a heart shape Pizza (which they had), but come to find out it was only for to go orders. The waiter never offered if we would like to purchase it. Which I probably would of paid for no matter the cost. The service was sub par. The kids personal pizza came out 15 mins after our main course arrived. A manager never cam to see how our experience was, or just to check on the table. Food was good, but this is a poorly run Bucca's. Sadly we will not be returning to this location. We will try other locations but refuse to come back to ROBINSON."}
{"text":"Been going to Buca for years, aways get huge plates of good food here, good service as well, nice surroundings. Amazing pasta dishes, unless you have a very large group of people with you there will be delicious left overs!"}
{"text":"Jarrett was our server. He was friendly and attentive. This was the first time we've eaten here and our bread was served warm. Thank you Jarrett."}
{"text":"I am not going to take down the previous review, because this shows how much a company can recover! 

This part of the review was from me not telling anyone in Bucca that I was visiting again and was of my own accord, they have changed this facility around in a heartbeat and I can't tell you how much. The food was better, the experience was better and the overall feeling was better! It feels like the Bucca that I was introduced to many years ago. 

Cheers and good luck!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the food great! We got the large Alfredo which said it could feed 4-6 people and we have plenty leftover. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love this location ... Jarrett is awesome!!!! He makes sure we are taken care An happy!!"}
{"text":"I've had Bucca Di Peppo as catering before, it was just OK. 

We decided on Italian and since Bucca Di Peppo was in the hotel we were staying at, there was a 30 minute wait (Saturday night)  So we walked over to one of the gift shops and bought a few things for the kids while we waited. Once seated our orders were taken quickly, my drink was delivered quickly and the waiter explained how big the portions were and took the time to give recommendations for us.

I am blown away. Yes it was busy,  but our server was SUPER attentive, he came by 7 times, checking on my drink, if the food was good, but not in a rushing or pushy way, he was just passing by and would check on us.

The food was fantastic! We had meatballs (the pasta was the only thing lacking, it was WAY over cooked, and watery in the bottom of the bowl) But the meatballs were AMAZING and then we also got chicken stuffed with cheese and prosciutto, we got potatoes as a side. I'm so glad that we tried this place. I got lemon basil vojitos and which were PERFECT!

There was a lot of food, and we couldn't finish the left over which we didn't take because we were in a hotel but it was worth it. Since we have one here in the area we live in, I think we will take the kids next time, its SO worth it to go sit down and enjoy it all fresh."}
{"text":"Bucca di Beppo advertises Italian family style dining....well, I don't know much about Italian families, but I know there wasn't enough food for my Jewish family.

The way the sizing works at Bucca di Beppo is that a small dish feed 3 and a large dish feeds 6...except that those numbers are not very accurate. 

My family was celebrating my grandmothers 75th birthday and this was the only place she would even consider going. She loves the atmosphere and she loves the food. I understand where she is coming in those regards. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting  (4/5) and the food is pretty decent Italian fare (3/5-a little skimpy on the sauce). It's really just the amounts I protested.

Our party of 9 ordered 1 large dish and 4 small dishes. By Bucca di Beppo's logic, that amount of food should feed 18 people and yet my family was scrounging for food by the end. We all expected to walk away from that table completely stuffed and regretting that meal the next morning when we stepped on the scale, but we all walked out feeling pretty light and not at all regretful.

My problem is not with the food at this restaurant, but with their measurements. I think I'll go back to Bucca di Beppo, but this time I'll come knowing that I need to order much more than they recommend."}
{"text":"I was interested in Buca due to the affordable prices and then really fell in love with the menu.  It was a gamble to get my wedding catered by a restaurant I had never tried before but it was recommended by a friend so I figured. Lets do it. 

I called only one day in advance! The general manager was super helpful. I think his name was David. But there's two David's who work at that location.

It was truly an awesome experience they were early and fast and efficient. They kid brought the food all the way to my room on a cart.  All of my guests were really impressed with the food. My son only ate the bread because he never likes anything so I thought that was nice they had a package to purchase that offered bread.  My husband doesn't eat vegetables or spaghetti sauce so he ate the mac n cheese pan. And everyone else ranted and raved about how good the spaghetti and meat sauce was and the salads and the egg plant Parmesan was absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much for making my day even more special."}
{"text":"This fantastic little gem in this crazy town is perfect for couple's, family and friends!  A well picked staff adds its own personality to the experience of delectable tastes and delicious beverages paired to offer the most spectacular combinations! We loved having Dave as our Dinner Host and the management team was outstanding in coordination of our meal!  A must visit when in Vegas for sure!!!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! My husband and I live a half mile away from this restaurant and I have been telling him how good Buca is and that we needed to eat there. Finally last night, my husband agreed to have dinner there. We were promptly seated in the bar area, initially they were going to seat us in a small two top, the place was virtually empty so we asked if we could please have a booth. Which the hostess grudgingly allowed us. Our waiter, Adam stopped by and asked us if we wanted to order drinks and an appetizer. So we said yes, we ordered a glass of wine each and the small caprese which was 15.00 for five slices! What? We also ordered a small salad and the chicken rigatoni Nero style. Our waiter acted like he was too busy to pay attention to our table. We snagged him and asked for bread, which he said he would bring later because it was in the oven. It's dinner time, why wasn't the bread ready? When he finally brought the bread he left it at the edge of the large table and left a small bowl with merely a splash of olive oil and balsamic. And also left it on the edge of the table where we couldn't reach it. We had to go around to the other side to bring the bread and balsamic in front of us. We had to chuckle because there was only enough olive oil and balsamic for each of us to dip once. Our waiter was MIA so my husband got up to go get more. The bartender saw him and kindly said that he would get more for us, which he did. We only received one plate each that was to accommodate our appetizer, our bread and our salad. We were surprised that we had to use the same plate for all three. Our waiter made cursory walk bys without stopping to check on us. When our entree arrived, we were presented with clean plates. Items were dropped at the table without even an acknowledgement of our existence. The Chicken Rigatoni had good flavor only because we asked for it extra spicy, but the pasta was not done and there was so little chicken included in the dish. We literally had one or two bites if chicken each on our 23.00 chicken rigatoni entree.  When our bill was presented to us, and when I say presented, I mean dropped on the table, we were shocked. We each had one.glass of wine and they were 15.00 each; we did not expect that. This meal totaled out at 91.85, not including tip. We decided even if we didn't eat the leftovers that we sure in the heck were taking them with us. We asked for 'to go' containers and they were literally thrown on the table. I had to laugh because I was so shocked that our server couldn't be bothered to plate our leftovers in the containers.  We still each had wine in our glass, so again we weren't going to leave that liquid gold behind, so we sat and finished it. I have been to a couple of different Buca Di Beppo's before and had good experiences, however this location was horrible and I will never ever return here or to any other location. Way overrated when food is not the quality of the price charged and when the service is so bad that you actually have to laugh and not get mad. The only light was that the bartender, Jason was helpful and friendly. Perhaps he could give Adam a few tips in service."}
{"text":"Jared from Buca made me a fan before I even tried the food. I ordered thru a second party app for delivery when the driver decided to not deliver my food. I called and Jared assured me that they would make it fresh and get it taken care of for me. It wasn't the stores fault that the food wasn't delivered, but he went out of my way to make sure the food was fresh. Thank you Jared!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service !!! Then employees are a mess with no knowledge of anything on the menu. My server said are you ready to order, we said yes . He told us to start ordering (he didn't write anything down) then after he said okay let me check and looks at the menu and couldn't repeat the order for us. GET A PEN AND FREAKING PAPER IF YOU CANT TAKE AN ORDER WITHOUT IT...he went to get a pen and paper and didn't even come back for 15 mins!! We waited forever on a random Thursday afternoon. When they were dead . Horrible horrible horrible . They should just closed down!!"}
{"text":"Turns out it was the $85 dinner from hell... As we walked out after paying, my wife has declared this the \"Italian Denny's!\"

I WISH I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I MADE RESERVATIONS!

Started off strong... Massive potential!  Easy reservations were made using Open Table. We found easy parking out front.  We really loved the walk through the kitchen to get to the dining room. The old world Italian decor is great.

Super sweet waitress named Ana was the best part of the experience and that's were the amore stops!

We ordered a small family sized spicy chicken rigatoni, a small Margareta pizza and a side of spaghetti and meatballs. It looked so amazing on the menu. 

When our food was dropped off, Ana asked if there was anything else she could get us...  Um... Yes. Silverware please!  There was a grand total of 1 silverware rollup for a party of 4!

For the record, it is too bad the way the item looks on the menu doesn't equal how a dish tastes. Unfortunately what came out was cold pasta and hot chicken for the rigatoni, the Spaghetti and meatballs had very little sauce and the meatball tasted like a bland ball of hamburger meat. The kids liked their pizza so at least our sanity remained in tact.  We got a replacement spicy rigatoni... I took 1 bite of the chicken and that was it for me. It grossed me out so I stuck with the pasta and lightly spiced ball of burger. I asked for more sauce and ended up using the entire shaker of grated Parmesan cheese to no avail!

Since you've made it this far, stick around for the highlight: I totally loved the part where Ana asked if one of the kids wanted a refill. She delivered the fancy plastic kid's cup of water sans the lid in one hand and a dirty broom and dust pan in the other. Seriously!!!  But wait, there is more...  When she realized that she forgot the lid, she came back with the lid in the OPPOSITE hand and the dirty broom and dust pan in the other. At least she has bubbly personality and she was literally drenched in sweat. But she was sweet so she has that going for her!?!?

This was only my second time visiting a Buca di Beppo... I visited one in Orlando 13 years ago and remember it being really good. Must have been nostalgia and great company. 

The next time I get a bright idea to eat Italian at a chain restaurant, I'll stick with Maggiano's. Thanks. 

Seriously, we are not making this up. Everything in this review is 100% accurate and legit!

Coincidently located on Scottsdale Rd and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Went in with a party of four for a birthday lunch. We were seated in a room with a party of more than 15 and it was LOUD!! Asked to be moved and we were then seated near the bar. Our server was attentive of our table; drinks were filled, table clean, checked on. We had got the spaghetti with meatballs and chicken bacon carbonara. The spaghetti to me was better than the chicken. I was let down and the chicken dish was my pick. Birthday boy was given free ice cream and birthday song. When she comes back to being our bill she looks near the door"}
{"text":"My nephew's birthday was last week and we came here because he wanted some good ole spaghetti & meatballs.

The food wasn't spectacular, but it was good and really hit the spot!  Meatballs are the size of your head and the tomato sauce tasted more like freshly canned tomatoes rather than one that has been cooked down to stew..  But boy, the portions are HUGE!  We also had the penne with chicken & sundried tomato in cream sauce.  The pasta was cooke al dente and the flavors worked really well together in this dish.  And the chopped salad?  Good.  Stuffed mushroom?  Ok, but the pesto sauce outshined the mushrooms.

Needless to say, we stuffed ourselves silly but still took leftover home to last for a week.  My nephew was happy and had the biggest smile when the entire dining room sang happy birthday to him.  This is a fun restaurant and a great place to celebrate a birthday!!"}
{"text":"Mini portion Togo. Best lasagna ever! I love eating left overs from here. Happy birthday mom."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the service is hit or miss. My first visit was for a dinner party, and my experience was phenomenal! My husband and I went back a couple weeks later for lunch, and we enjoyed ourselves once again! I was definitely a fan!!! My third visit, I brought a girlfriend with me! I kept raving about this place to her. The service was the worst yet!!!! Our server was awful. Some people just aren't cut to be servers. She never refilled our waters, she didn't bring the oil and vinegar for our bread, and when we mentioned that our dessert we ordered was still frozen, instead of offering us something else, she only offered a to-go box to take it home and eat it later. I haven't been back since this visit which was in November. The food is good and consistent, and I hope I have the courage to return. I may just order to-go. Please Buca...get your servers on the same page!"}
{"text":"Normally very happy with this place but came here for Mother's Day.  16 people. Made reservations using open table for 7:15. It's now 8:50 and still don't have food yet. Very unhappy. They obviously overbooked and couldn't handle it."}
{"text":"Wow.  So much to say about the Thanksgiving 2015 experience. I realize the last time I reviewed Buca was in 2007, and my have things changed.  It's a chain, I get that, more on that later.  

We arrived with a reservation for 6 but added two who were not eating.  That threw them through a bit of a loop but they handled it well.  If it weren't for the staff being able to rework the reservation, they would have gotten 1 star.

What I remember most fondly about Buca was their garlic bread with cheese.  It used to be served in this cast-iron pie dish.  Not anymore. Instead, this gummy, undercooked (COLD) garlic bread arrived at the table.  I guess cold is the theme for the meal.  The house salad did fine but was sort of not impressive enough to distract from the cold bread.  Wine was served.  And drank.  And drank.  Because it took our food FOREVER to come.  We ordered the traditional Thanksgiving meal for 10 and a large side of pasta (when in Rome).

After our meal arrived, we dug in.  Turkey Breast (so SO DRY) on top of stuffing (which most folks liked) both were COLD.  Mashed potatoes (those were pretty good, but cold.. If they weren't cold, I would have had seconds). Green beans (cold).  We told the waitress but she was empathatic.  The manager came out and offered to give us more food but because we had waited SO LONG to begin with, we dug in and didn't find it necessary to wait again for more food.  Pasta dish was cold on the top and hot on the bottom.

I think a lot could improve on this visit.  The restaurant wasn't packed, so there was definitely some disconnect between the kitchen and the servers.  I likely will not return to Buca.  The empathetic management and poor quality of food is just not worth the expense."}
{"text":"The absolute biggest waste of a precious date night away from new baby. $60 for two people to eat the worst chicken Marisella, small plate of pasta, and two glasses of house wine. We are still hungry and pissed!"}
{"text":"A disgrace to Italians everywhere.  To consider this Italian food, we may as well consider Pizza Hut an Italian restaurant.  I do not normally go to chain Italian restaurants, but was here for a group dinner.  Unseasoned food... Very bland.  I have literally had better hospital food.  No exaggeration.  Decor and atmosphere was reasonable.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"For the forth time in a row I showed up here with my family (12 of us) for a birthday dinner, and the reservation that we had made was not in there book. Thats 4 out of the last 5 times I have been there in the last 2 years. I'm really losing faith. They did manage to get us seated after a short while, but were clearly not prepared for the large table. The server was obviously working another section and then had to take on a table of 12 as well. And It showed. took almost 30 minutes just to get our drinks. The dinner took almost 4 hours and we were all frustrated and ready to leave. Might have to find another place for big birthday dinners in the future."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  Very flavorful southern Italian cuisine.  Lots of garlic.  Live the buca salad then just about every dish. Love the chicken saltinboca.   Also the kids meals are great.  Dessert ok  service great. All in all we keep coming back. Fun fame place."}
{"text":"The customer service is appalling. Nothing like trying to flag down wait staff after you've been waiting to pay for 30 min, just to watch a little group of them laughing and dancing around like THEY are the tourists. Cheesy bread was awesome. Alfredo was bland. Find a better place to go that will treat you well."}
{"text":"Ordered Valentine's Dinner to go. Horrible experience start to nasty finish. Tried to call with my issues. No one picked up the phone.  Reported to Buca website no response. Only bonus...a marinara sticker dated 2/13 use by 2/17, with our pasta..gross! Try getting your family to eat more food when find trash in your food."}
{"text":"There was a really long wait when I came here with family on a Friday night. Unfortunately for us, there was some big prom-babyshower-post wedding celebration going on. Those people took up half the restaurant. 

However, the food was good and the waitress we had was really attentive and got us everything we wanted pretty quickly. Calamari was good. I had the chicken stuffed prosciutto, which I thought was pretty insane!

Word of advice: get reservations regardless or you'll end up waiting almost an hour for a table if you come at the wrong time."}
{"text":"I ordered spaghetti and rigatoni for take out. Nice girl at the counter tries to ring up my order and computer will not work. Played with it for about 8 mins. She gets manager Joshua Gleason to help. He plays with it for about 5 mins and restarts it. Waited for the reboot and still not working. Food is sitting on cart. She finds Joshua again. We have now been here for about 20 mins. He plays with the computer and can't get it to work. Nice girl walks away, Manager does not offer an apology, acknowledge our presence, says nothing to me. He took my card and walked away. Finished the transaction elsewhere and returns my card to girl in the takeout area. Who passes it to me. Very poor example for his employee who was very nice. He never offered an apology, a dessert, a discount. But first and foremost an apology. I was VERY disappointed with his actions. When my kids were teenager and had friends over, I ordered lots of food from Buca in Chandler. They are adults now, and servings are too large. So I haven't been back in a while. I will not return to the Scottsdale store again."}
{"text":"Super unfriendly staff. We made a reservation for a party of 12 with a wheelchair. We were sat at a table for 10. The manager, Robert, told us he didn't know what to tell us and we couldn't be moved. He suggested we dine somewhere else. Happily."}
{"text":"Great place to try Italian food. Nice decoration and good service. Their tomato sauce is unique and a must to try. They also have great menu of desert too. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The food was ok and the service was awful. They bussed our table WHILE WE WERE THERE. The beer was hot and flat and in a hot glass. It's just not good. If you need to feed 20 people on a whim then it's manageable, otherwise avoid it."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain. The (excellent) waiter told me they make the sangria, sauce & meatballs on site fresh each day. Let the sangria soak in fruit 24 hrs before serving. Pasta beautifully cooked (wish they had a whole wheat option). Sauce & meatball delicious!  They let me order off the menu bc was here on my own and normal servings are family sized for two or more. Caesar salad fresh & not overdressed, w lots of freshly grated Parmesan on top. Love the kitschy atmosphere. 

Recent visit. Antipasto Salad outstanding!  Scampi pasta not so much. Under seasoned. Not enough garlic. Plenty of fat but not olive oil or butter. Some bland vegetable oil--all the calories and none of the flavor."}
{"text":"I was less than impressed. The meatballs were greasy and very bland. The price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive. Based on the reviews I was excited to try, but I will stick to Olive Garden or even Stouffers lasagna."}
{"text":"We had great food and great service here. The Dolce platter is a combination of 4 incredible desserts. The portions here are extremely large! We also had the supreme pizza. They have happy hour all day long with very reasonable drink prices at the bar."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Ordered a to go through yelp. Got to the restaurant 23 min later. They gave us the wrong order! When brought back server placed the blame on us. Then to make it worse manger told me my order was just entered 20 min after order. I asked what took so long. His answer was it is faxed to them and he doesn't have time to sit in the office and wait for faxed orders. So he gets them when he has time to check. They were rude about it. Good food horrible service. You don't blame the guest."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while, but every time I do make it in, it's always a pleasure. We lucked out and got here pretty much right when it opened on a Thursday. Had the place to ourselves, had a super nice waitress (from France I should note) chicken parm was the bomb, meatballs were excellent and the spaghetti with marinara was awesome."}
{"text":"Third time I've been here in a 10 year period. I've never had good service and find the food to be about 3.5 stars. Last night was the worst... absolutely horrible! We were there for a friend's daughter's 21st birthday. They were out of the beer we ordered, then they were out of pizza. Yes, pizza!!! What Italian restaurant runs out of pizza at 7:30 on a Saturday night? We were in there for well over 2 hours due to slow service, and when we mentioned our unhappiness we weren't offered any kind of discount nor did they give the birthday girl a free dessert. The bill was $175 for 6 people... absolutely not worth it!!! When we went to pay the credit card machine was down. I'm not kidding. Our waitress had such a bad condescending attitude the whole time and acted like we were bothering her. I hope I never get invited to a birthday dinner here again, even if I'm not paying. 

And to top the shitty birthday off, the waitress wouldn't accept the 21 year old's license because it was vertical. She had been 21 for less than a day. Geesh. Luckily the manager approved it."}
{"text":"Awesome place for the whole family. Such a unique way to serve food. Very Italian with lots of entertaining decor. The service was awesome.... super friendly!! And the food was outstanding... my favorite is the calamari appetizer."}
{"text":"We generally like this chain but have sworn off (and at) this particular location after multiple tries over several years. The lack of service here makes it a VERY unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"As par for the course, I see the reviews for this place are all over the map.

Honestly I came here specifically because this particular restaurant and location participates in a dining for miles program, and I needed a few miles to keep my status alive with a particular airline, and this place was nearby...

I made an Opentable reservation for 4p (figured I'd get 100 pts for that as well), and arrived at 3:45p which was past the lunch menu cut-off. I sat at the bar, the bartender was friendly and courteous, and offered me the lunch menu to order off of, which I truly appreciated. Really, he could not have been more helpful.

I ordered the standard spaghetti and meatballs (pik attached), and honestly it was pretty good. Came with a side of bread and oil.

So I have nothing negative to say, it was a pleasant experience all around. A-OK :)"}
{"text":"Baked Ziti is to die for absolutely delicious! Definatly reccomend and am coming back!"}
{"text":"I was brought here for a family meal & love it. The atmosphere is fun and the food & service make me want to return. Thank you."}
{"text":"I didn't really have any expectations prior to visiting Buca di Beppo.  My friends and I just wanted to have a nice dinner before watching a show.  And Buca di Beppo is conveniently located at the Excalibur hotel, so we decided to eat there.  

The wait was about 15 minutes, and when we got to our table, our server (forgot his name) was so attentive and friendly.  I enjoyed the atmosphere, very casual and relax - it's a family style restaurant where they serve large portions to share.  

We ordered Baked Ziti and Salmon for all of us to share (4 total) and it was plenty enough that we had left overs.  

I would go back there again to try their other entries."}
{"text":"We went to Buca di Deppo for a birthday party. At the entrance we were greeted by the hosts and escorted to the table. The place looks like an old Italian home. It's nice to look at the decor when it's your first time but it does get old eventually. The first thing that I have noticed when I sat down was that my wine glass was dirty. Food was served very quickly. The salad was definitely old as none of the veggies had any crisp. The salad was limp and soggy. None of the dishes that we ordered were fresh or tasted good. Disappointing experience, came home hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed to the point I will probably never return. We went for dinner after the dinner rush at 7pm, this place was super noisy to the point where we couldn't have a conversation with people at the table. Seemed like they were seating by the rooms vs by server, so once one room was filled up they would seat in another area. 

My biggest complaint is that I ordered Veal Marsala, my veal was VERY overcooked and tough to even cut into, I did tell our server who swapped out for Chicken Marsala however it took them about 40 minutes and by the time I was super annoyed and not hungry let alone my friends and family were already finished eating. Also, two people at my table ordered meatballs, they were also overcooked and came to the table luke warm, they were not eaten and asked to be taken off the bill. The manager said that the meatballs were boiled and probably at the bottom of the pot and not stirred. 

Christina was our server and probably the ONLY thing positive I can say was that she was very sweet and accommodating however I would suggest giving this girl a promotion to manager as the manager who came to speak with us never introduced himself, had a bad attitude and did the bare minimum by taking the meatballs and Marsala off the bill but his attitude wasn't one of a manager should have. The only way I knew his name was that his initials are on the bill and it on the door. 

And for a suggestion.....it would be really nice if they offered gluten-free pasta for those of us with allergies since they are a pasta establishment. I had 5 things to choose from, and 3 of those I couldn't eat...you know the rest of the two other options. Meh!"}
{"text":"We arrived here at 8:47 and the doors were locked. We saw the hostess standing there by the door, she looked at us, turned and walked away. The hours for today are closing at 9pm, this is Vegas, this is ridiculous! So disappointed!"}
{"text":"This past Wednesday we hosted a birthday party for 80-year-old mother. Kimmy helped us plan everything and since we were planning from Los Angeles it could have been very hard for us but she made it very easy.  The servers were great the atmosphere was wonderful they did everything that we asked everybody had a great time.  thank you to Kimmy and the Buca staff for the most helping us host a successful party for 34"}
{"text":"Very awesome restaurant. Waiter was nice and knowledgeable when asked questions.  It's a family size portions place and they are huge! 
Highly recommend the cheese ravioli!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was good. I don't know why they have some bad reviews? I have never had anything bad from Buca."}
{"text":"We went here for my husbands birthday. I ordered mozzarella garlic bread, received regular garlic bread yet was charged for the mozzarella one.... obviously people not paying any attention. I did not bring it up due to being a celebration. Due to that lack I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, drinks, and menu selection. Love the off the menu option of mussels! Absolutely delicious and the wait staff ROCKS! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm seeing a lot of reviews that mention poor service. Not the case here. I would give 4.5/5 for our service. Our waitress was attentive and patient. We had a lot of questions and picking a few dishes that everyone will like is not an easy task. She came back a number of times to check on us until we were ready to place our order.
Food was average, it isn't bad, there was just something about it that didn't click with me. One reason might have been that the sauce was too sweet.
My biggest complaint was that the table was rather dirty and was kind of squished into a small alcove with similar tables. I don't know if I would come back, I would probably try the to-go option in the future but only if I had a coupon or something."}
{"text":"Okay the food was slightly better than I remember it. Haven't been here in 10 years... Won't be back for another 10... Service was rushed and weird for lack of a better term... Salty food, over priced beverage, and the people I ate with we're slobs! :)"}
{"text":"Tonight  my husband  and I went to bucas  because  we received  an email  saying they had linguini  and clams in a red sauce or white  clam sauce. I was so excited  about  dinner  tonight  because  linguini  and white clam sauce is one of my favorite  things. First  of  all  the waitress we had didn't  have a clue that this dish even existed, then when she got that figured  out I was VERYclear that I wanted white clam sauce. We wait for  30 minutes  for our food and when the linguini  comes out its  got lots of clams nut no white sauce.  Instead it's a runny broth at the bottom  of  the  bowl. I told the waitress that this is not what I ordered  so she went and got the manager.  When the manager  came out he explained  that this runny  brown  broth at the bottom  of my bowl was a white sauce. I told him to take dish back. Once again  we leave this place unhappy  and dissatisfied. We will never go back again. This food is just crap."}
{"text":"It's a chain.

Chicken Parm isn't bad, especially when you aren't paying for it.

Ya feel me?"}
{"text":"Great food & service at Buca di Beppo, surprised with all the negative reviews. I would have given 5 stars but out wine glass could have been a bit cleaner."}
{"text":"Too bad, I had to give them a star!!! IF I  would have a choice... NO STARS, at all! They said they were busy,  to receive our appetizer one hour later!! Like fricking seriously... I wanted to get up and leave, but my party said give them 5more minutes. Ughhh... food sucked!! Service was slow!!! A couple came in 20 mins before we left and got their appetizers 15mins after. WTF!!!! Sorry, I'm still furious because I paid SO much money for food I can cook at home and be done in 30mins."}
{"text":"The fam n I went here to meet up with a friend of my boyfriends (who lives in Vegas) & his family, since it's kid friendly & not \"strip\" crazy. Our reservations were for 5:00pm & our show started @ 7, so I was hoping they'd be on the ball...well they were!

The waiter was very helpful & quick, the food was out to us in a very timely manner & it was delicious! 

We ordered:
*Margherita  Pizza
*Spaghetti
*Linguini in clam sauce
*Caesar Salad
*Chicken Parmigiana

all of which was hot & so so so tasty & filling...not to mention decently priced due to it being off the strip...We left the restaurant at about 6:20, perfect timing!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is always lively and I love the serving staff. The food always fills me up. Perfect for friend gatherings or family outings. Not really a place for a romantic rendezvous or intimate evenings due to the fact it can get loud at times. Overall I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food...with lots of leftovers. It definitely won't be our last visit. Really wanted to try the warm spinach salad but knew I wouldn't have room for dinner...next time salad and cheese bread...which was the best!"}
{"text":"Took the family here to celebrate my Son's Birthday.  He likes Buca because of the large portions of food.  Even though it's a chain, I don't mind coming here....as long as the family is happy, I'm happy.

We ordered:

Gnocchi w/tons of Gorgonzola Cheese

{"text":"Always liked Buca, but Ive given up on this location. Have been disappointed for the last time. Service almost always mediocre. Food quality has gone down. We even did the kitchen table, which is always fun at other locations, bit a total drag at this location. This most recent trip yesterday for 2 family members birthdays was the last time Im going. Terrible service and no HappyBirthday song or anything special. Sorry Buca Arrowhead, chio."}
{"text":"Taking our four young grandchildren I checked ahead and saw that it was rated good for kids. I disagree! What about all the photos on the walls of naked women, naked boy urinating, etc. as I took the little girls to the bathroom, one of them told me to \"don't look at the walls, just look at the floor.\"
On top of these, we paid $70 for 3 kids meals and one adult sharing dish of spaghetti and meatballs.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service and good food(taste and portion), for very correct prices. A good place to try out of the Strip."}
{"text":"Huge portion great prices and delicious food.  Highly recommended!  Staff was very good."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the service and food. It is definitely way over priced! When I spoke to the manager about why is it that servings were so small and so pricey he was not sympathetic nor could he give a response that made any sense! The quality and quantity of the food isn't what It was before and I mean about 3 Years ago! We didn't seem to be a priority to the server because it seemed to them like we didn't have any money. It is really upsetting when you go somewhere and they well very much stereotype. We will never go back nor will we recommend to anybody to go! People save your money and go to either Casa Di Amor or Olive Garden! We felt ripped off and unimportant! Mind you we came in when it was not busy at all!"}
{"text":"It is a lovely place and the food is good, but the protions are so big you have to share... I have never hadthe chance to order what I reallyw ant because I ened to compromise and share with someone else... :-("}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst. We arrived just before 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon. While we were waiting on the hostess to show up, one of the staff (apparently she's the manager, we found that out when the table behind us made a complaint about their slow services) ran passed by us and out of the door like we were invisible. So we waited. Finally someone showed up and seated us (the manager returned to tell the hostess how hot the weather was outside while she tried to show us our table). 
As we walked through the restaurant, it was very quite and nearly empty. Our waitress took our order relatively quick, and brought out bread etc. per usual. We didn't realize how long we waited until our 4 year old started to become fussy. 45 mins! We didn't get 1 dish! As soon as we could find our waitress, we asked her whether our food was on the way. Her response: 'any minute now. But I can bring out the salad first.' Sure. It took her another 10 minuets to bring out our salad. By now it's over an hour and we still didn't get any entrees. We told our waitress to cancel our order and walked out. 
Get your acts together and hire a better management team!"}
{"text":"The worst.  Please just save yourself the trouble and pick somewhere else to eat.  Trust me on this one.  Unless you like to eat in filth and enjoy bland food, you will regret having set foot in this place.  Filth everywhere, we should have exited immediately.  Close your eyes when using the restrooms.  Sinks are grey with scum - unflushed toilets - glad I waited to see this until after I ate.  Carpeting is worn, faded, and filthy.  Ugh - one of the absolute worst dining experiences.  I am crossing my fingers that I don't end up with food poisoning.  If the rest of the place was this bad - I really wonder how the kitchen could possibly be up to par."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved it here! Jarrett was our server and he was great!! He completed the experience or should I say enhanced. The food is good and priced well for family portions. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I used to love eating here, but tonight was the last time I'll ever go there again. My boyfriend & I decided to go to use a gift card I'd gotten awhile ago. I made the mistake of telling our server (Deanna) this when she asked if we were celebrating anything special. Once she heard that, her kind and helpful manner went out the window. We ordered our drinks & appetizers around 6:45 had almost finished them at 7:15 before we had to get her attention from the table next to us to order our meals. 
I am not an impatient person, & have worked in the service industry for almost 10 years, but it was getting to the point where we felt like we were an inconvenience to her. She didn't bring us our food, extra napkins, or anything after taking our meal orders...it was all bussers, which I have to say were amazing & took great care of us. 
We asked for the check, mind you every time I had to ask her for something was when she was helping the table next to us, who was a party of 6 that she sat 15 mins after us, & got them done & out almost a half hour after us. 
Once we got the check it only got worse. She left it sitting with us for another 10-15 mins, came and snatched it when she finally came by, and then stayed in the back with our gift card & debit card for another 10. When my boyfriend asked what was taking so long she said it was because she had to run the gift card and then transfer the difference? When she finally brought  it back she mumbled \"sorry it took so long but it's because of your gift card\". 
When we left I checked the receipt because the gift card was for $50. She had only ran it for $46.25. Odd right? So I checked our bank account, & she had in fact charged my debit card twice. We went in and spoke to the manager & explained what all had happened, & when she called Deanna over, she claimed that she thought our debit card was the gift card. 
I don't buy it, she was awful to us because she assumed since we had a gift card that we wouldn't tip, then blamed us for our checkout process being so long on the gift card, & then when all was said and done, you didn't know which one was the gift card?! Sorry but no. Save yourself the time & headache & go elsewhere. I'd like to believe the best about people, but it was clear that this girl took it upon herself & decided that we were an inconvenience & wouldn't tip her because we had a gift card. When in fact we are quite the opposite. Even if we were the worst customers & just taking advantage of a cheap meal, that's not for you to decide! Nor is it your place to make paying customers who come to YOUR choice of profession, feel unwelcome & at fault for your own greed & bad attitude."}
{"text":"Great environment, great food!  Unfortunately, our server, who we'll call Nick cause that's his name, just didn't have it together.  We waited so long for our wine my son had to get up and go get him.  We could see him standing in the kitchen just waiting for food to come up.  When we finally got our main meals, he had forgotten to bring us our appetizers which had been sitting on the counter right in front of him, so ALL the food came at the same time.  We were there celebrating and I have to say, the bad service did detract from our evening."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, very original. The moment you walk in their door they ask if you have been there before. Then you go through a tour of the place. They have their own table in the kitchen you must reserve and you eat while watching the chefs cook. It's a family style so it's really perfect if you have a bigger family. For just two ppl it's a little harder cause their portions are so big that you should share. We weren't blown away by their food. It seems as though they use their large portions to overcompensate for the lack of flavor. There food was good just didn't seem to \"wow us\". It's more of a really cool atmosphere. Service was decent. Overall great restaurant."}
{"text":"The Best Italian Restaurant in Charlotte, NC. They have lot of Italian American pictures/memorabilia decorate the walls, different seating area (rooms) have different theme. We went their for dinner and I would say their size is big compare to other restaurant. I ordered a draft beer and I got a King size beer glass. I ordered Eggplant Parmesan small portion and still I was not able to finish it. overall it was very good experience so I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"As much as I loved Stratta the last time, I had to budget a bit this time and get food that is actually worth my money. I found this Buca on the GPS to be very close to the Hard Rock. Infact it was just down the street from the Hard Rock on Flamingo. I came here on a Sunday evening, and there was next to no one here at 6pm. It took a total of 2 minutes to get seated. 

The menu is exactly like any other Buca's around in Socal. I ordered the Quatro Al Forno which comes with 4 different kinds of pasta and a meatball on the side. The total after tip had to be less the $20. This wouldn't buy me a single plate of food at the Wynn. The management there was very friendly. I remember them asking me how the place compared to the ones in Socal. I lied and told them its superb, when really it was on the same level. Its a franchise, what else can you expect but some good proportioned Italian cooking at the Buca?"}
{"text":"Do not order catering from this place. I called in on 6/23/15 around 9:45am and the girl who took the order was so rude and was literally talking bad about be to the cooks while I was on the phone, and screwing me over by secretly putting more on the tab than I was asking for. Incredibly unprofessional. Will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but this place can get very busy and loud. I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic evening, but it is great for large families, parties, and two or more guests. I have yet to have a dish that I didn't like. 

I recommend getting your bread when you sit down if it is crowded because it may take a while to get your food. I have been ere several times and my favorite dish is the eggplant Parmesan one. There is also a really good seafood pasta, but you'll more than likely want to add salt because it is a very light dish."}
{"text":"We came to this location because it was nice and convenient for us to meet other family members. We had a party of 10. The food was pretty good and service was also good. The reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars is because it was unbelievably hot. Like we were sitting there sweating. We asked if the a/c could be turned down but if it was, we couldn't tell. At one point I asked my husband if it was hotter inside the restaurant or outside, in Las Vegas, during the summer. We were miserable."}
{"text":"My husband just took me there today and I loved it! We had to share the baked ziti plate because the plates are HUGE. I also had an Italian margarita and of course it was delicious. Definitely going to be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Outstanding service! (Branson in the bar area works the floor like a pro). We had a pizza which was tailored to our liking and spicy chicken pasta which was magical. Quick Service and delicious food exactly what we are looking for"}
{"text":"You can't be bothered to bring us water or ask for our order or even stop by at all for 15 minutes? Seriously? Then you seat other people and offer them drinks? Um yeah, no. The service was intolerable, and I'm writing this as we walk back to our car. Off to find local Italian!"}
{"text":"This isn't one of my favorites, but better than Olive garden.   Sauce is extremely acidic.   And waitress was far from good.  Very snobby.  I would much rather make the drive to little Italy any day as go back there.  Not worth the money we paid."}
{"text":"Went with my parents and kids. We got a large baked ziti, large spaghetti w/extra meat sauce and added meatballs, garden salad and garlic bread. Took a while to get our drinks, with no straws. Asked for straws. Got our salad. Server said garlic bread is coming right up. Finished salad and drink. Then a few minutes later came the straws. Asked for refills. Finally garlic bread came. 10 mins later after eating some garlic bread, refills came. Good thing I had my straw. Then came the meal. Not too bad. I seem to have a problem in this town asking for extra things and not getting it, or getting the very minimum one can possibly receive. The extra meat sauce came in a dipping sauce cup(about three tablespoons full). Seriously? Then it came time for dessert. Was going to get some ice cream, but two of my kids are allergic to milk, so I asked if they had sherbet. A simple yes or no would have sufficed. Instead I got huffed at and had a dessert menu shoved in my hand and was told \"this is what we have.\" So I dropped the menu, said forget dessert and asked for the check. RUDE! They got two stars for their portion sizes, but that's about it. Their food isn't anything to write home about, or get a good review. Prob won't be back."}
{"text":"Salad had too much dressing but broccoli was perfectly cooked. Not too crunchy & not too soft. The server was nice but forgot my spaghetti. Hope I didn't get charged now that I think about it. She did give great tips on what's great on the menu & they were better than average. A photographer came by, took a shot and returned with 2 pictures and we paid ridiculous $20. But I have to say that was the best picture ever anyone has taken of me. Usually I look like dorky nerdy old maid but that I tire of me was hot so my husband bought both of them."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience here. Although, the server was sweet and helpful, the food unfortunately was a joke. We ordered a sausage pasta dish, and a stuffed chicken plate that were both bland, overlooked, and not worth the somewhat steep price we paid for it. The place is not visually appealing either, the vintage cluttered look only brought out the large amount of dust scattered on the decorations."}
{"text":"We love Buca and have been to plenty. We always seem to get great service and food and this location at the Excalibur on the strip is no different. We had a large group of twelve so they set us up in the Pope Room. If you have never been to Buca, you can call ahead for a group of around 10 to 14 people. It is a large round table in a round sectioned off area with Pope and other Catholic pictures and memorabilia. There is a big lazy Susan in the middle with, guess what, a bust of a Pope! Its a fun place to sit.

We ordered the pizza which is thin crust and delicious as well as the apple salad, one of our favorites. We had a fettuccine Alfredo, a spaghetti and meatballs, macaroni and cheese & a spicy shrimp ziti. As we were guests, I did not participate in the ordering. My wife and our host did the ordering and they nailed it.

The service was great and they were constantly there with our drinks and removing dirty and unused dishes. 

If I had one complaint is that if you are coming to Buca specifically there is a parking charge. I know that there is another Buca in town that is a stand alone building so our host picked this place and it was fine. The casino is nice anyways!"}
{"text":"I was never going to write a review of this awful place as I couldn't justify the modest effort it would take to push the computer keys on  a review of such a low-brow, bland restaurant. But then I read a positive review a few before this one and I had to chime in.
Okay...here goes:
Compared to this place, the Olive Garden is Joel Robuchon. 
However if you think that tasteless food (in large quantities), served by bored, zombie wait-staff is something to cheer about, and you've hit all the buffets in town, then perhaps this is your kind of place.
However, if food with taste and style and care is what you're willing to pay hard-earned dollars for, then this is the Gateway to Hell.
God help all who enter."}
{"text":"Portions are huge! Our server linsey was awesome. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating was that two of our utensils had a little mess on them. It looked like when it went through the dishwasher it wasn't wash throughly."}
{"text":"Count this as no stars!
My husband, 2 kids and I came into this restaurant Monday about 2 pm to grab a little bite to eat. 
We didn't want much since we had tournament of the kings tickets for that night and I heard they serve a lot of food. 
I mean what's a better place to share a plate than Buca di Beppo right? Isn't that what their restaurant based on. 

We came and the restaurant had maybe 4 customers in there, we still had to wait 10 minutes for a table that was ok not really a problem. We were seated and the waiter came looked at my kids and his mood changed completely he was so rude!! My kids were seated nicely no peep out of them so that wasn't the problem he must have just not liked kids, anyway so we order our food and drinks he had an issue with our order because my husband and I wanted to split a lunch size plate and my kids split the spaghetti and meatballs (my son is 1 how much is he really going to eat) after that he was horrible! I mean I would have paid a split plate fee to avoid his horrible service. He brought out the bread and didn't offer oil and vinegar but he brought it and was very attentive to the table that was ordering a couple plates. The hostess had to serve our table because he wanted nothing to do with us (I'm thinking because of the tip size with a lower bill) I'm actually a really good tipper being a former server so I wouldn't tip based on the bill anyway. 

He never checked on us again. 

My daughter ordered the Pisa punch with the light up cup and she had to yell EXCUSE ME!!! To get the guys attention when she asked for a refill he said we had to pay for a refill I told him that was okay go ahead and get her more he took her cup and brought her another but charged me for 2 cups with punch not just the refill  that's fine but since I paid for the cup can I have it lol! 
In the end he was a major damper on our fun filled amazing day in Vegas. 
We go to 2 Buca locations in SoCal and love them but I don't think I will be a customer anymore if Buca allows their establishments to be run that way in any state."}
{"text":"I adore Italian food and Buca is my go-to choice here in town. This location has been around for over 10 years and the quality of the food has been consistently good. 

Everything on the menu is family style, so the portions are huge. A small size feeds about 3 people, while a large will feed 4-6. The fact that I can devour a large bowl of pasta by myself is truly a testament to my gluttony, and to the deliciousness of the food here. 

What's good besides everything? My family usually starts with a calamari - crispy, fried to perfection with a delicious housemade marinara sauce on the side. Apple Gorgonzola salad is a must try - always fresh, with sweet candies walnuts paired with the tartness of Granny Smith apples. 

For entrees we usually get the chicken marsala, which is always tender and bursting with flavor. Spaghetti and meatballs are bomb - the meatballs are the size of a child's head and SO good. The spicy chicken rigatoni is also delicious - cheesy sauce with a little kick. And don't forget the pizzas! Just try it and you'll never eat pizza anywhere else. 

The decor is traditional Italian - tons of black and white photos and other cultural memorabilia. There are multiple floors with tables of every size and private dining rooms for huge parties. For first timers you will receive a tour of the restaurant kitchen and inhale the heavenly aroma! 

Service is as good as it can get. I feel like this restaurant is understaffed most of the time so wait times for food, drink refills, etc can take a while. Our server one time was running around nonstop between multiple tables, each with parties of 6+. 

I will say that they are conscientious for mistaken orders. We asked for a small pizza and the kitchen had made a large, but we were only charged for a small and got to take extra leftovers home!

Overall I'm one satisfied customer and look forward to my next visit, soon!"}
{"text":"This place has very good food and definitely friendly servers. We were a group of 4 and even though it was super busy at the time that we went (Tuesday @ 7) during winter break; we were served really quickly and efficiently. Our server was amazing. He definitely deserves some stars. The food was well-seasoned. I went to Italy over the summer and I rather have these guys food."}
{"text":"All food is served family style and Meant to be Shared\"
 
This is one of those fun, themed, chain restaurants that manage to retain their unique identity, even though there are 51 other locations.  You would never guess that they all look just like the one you are in right now.
 
Okay, this restaurant is strictly for people with big appetites, a true love for starch, and lots of cheese (so, no atkins diet, lactose intolerant people please).  No need to list the assortment of classic Italian dishes like the Fettuccini , Lasagna, and Chicken Parmigiana, but one thing you must know: you have two choices between small and large portions.  Because this is family style dining, you either get a serving for 2-4 people, or 4-6.  This is traditional italian cooking, in a setting reminiscent of a devoutly catholic and Italian home. Pictures of the pope, Joe DiMaggio, Sophia Loren, and everyone Italian, are everywhere.  The particular location we visited had over 2,000 photographs on the wall.
 
There is unique seating throughout the restaurant.  Reserve a table in the kitchen (seats 6-10), or for large parties, reserve the \"Pope's Table\" that seats 12-18.  With upstairs and downstairs seating, there is plenty of room, and each corner of the restaurant will give you something to feast your eyes on.
 
Everything Italian, you can hear traditional Italian Folk music overhead, or classic Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.
 
My Favorite:
Antipasti:
Garlic Bread  with Mozzarella.     5.95 (small) like a pizza pie of bread, with whole garlic cloves and plenty of mozza
Entrée:
Chicken with Lemon       13.95 (SMALL) two tender pieces of chicken breast, doused in a lemony caper sauce. I get it every time I come here.
 
go to the website, and they list the entire menu.  see their list of accolades, or make a reservation online!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal and the service was really on point. Everything was excellent. Surprisingly, though we had an issue with the veal being overcooked. When we informed our server, Joe, he took care of it immediately and without hassle. Not only did Joe take it off the bill but he also replaced the dish. Then, Chef Eduardo came out and personally apologized to us. We were very pleased with how it was dealt with and even felt they had gone a little over the call of duty and then a complimentary dessert arrived at our table. It was incredible! I can't believe how much everyone cared that one dish out of our whole meal was less than fantastic. It is refreshing to see that customer service is alive and well at this Bucca Di Beppo. Thanks Joe, Bob, and Chef Eduardo for making our dining experience so enjoyable. See you next time!"}
{"text":"I wa ass visiting the area when we decided to visit for dinner.  Upon walking in their was a 2 hour wait for a table without a reservation, but the bar was open.  This is a family style place, so ordering dishes is either in small or large and shared amongst the diners.  

Service was informal and familiar.  As we dined, others came to the bar and seemed to know the bartender and staff by name.  This is great and made me feel welcomed.

The food - I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and it tasted like it was housed with food - a bad after taste.  The food was OK, not nearly the quality I expected for the price.  We ordered the Apple Gorgonzola salad, brussel sprouts, salmon, and Shrimp Florentine.  The salad was average and made with iceberg lettuce.  The menu said it was to be made with mixed greens.  However, the dressing was nice and light and the apples crisp.  The brussel sprouts were absolutely wonderful - cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The salmon was well-done and dry - I was not afforded the opportunity to request that the salmon cooked to medium well.  The Shrimp Florentine seemed to have precooked shrimp and alot of pasta.  There was less than an ounce of spinach.  

These dishes totaled about $125.00.  Again, for the price if the meal, the quality of the food was not in alignment.

If in town again, I will likely give it another try.  As it was a popular place, it seems as though they may have some local favorites for dishes."}
{"text":"this is the worst experience I've ever had at this restaurant. I am BEYOND disappointed and just plain hungry. 

whenever we come to town, we like to come here because we don't have one at home. I made a reservation and got here about 5 minutes early. 

the first thing we smelled was an amazing garlic smell in the parking lot. unfortunately the closer we got to the front doors of the restaurant, the more it smelled like raw sewage. then we found out that we would have to wait because our table wasn't ready. and they don't have pagers so you HAVE to wait by the front door or you can't hear the girl with the tiny voice call your name. so we had to stand in that smell for 45 MINUTES. 

despite our reservation we waited almost an hour. we watched other people get tables and come out already fed in the time we waited. then when we finally got a table, they couldn't accommodate our party of 7 so we had to split up just so we could eat. what was supposed to be a nice welcome meal to celebrate a friend coming to arizona for the first time has turned into \"let's eat and get the hell outta here.\" 

our appetizers were cold and our entrees were alright. when we ordered drinks there weren't any clean glasses so we had to wait again. then we got nothing but a quick \"uh sorry\" about the entire thing from our hostess. 

the one shining star in all this was out server, Christina. she was awesome.

but NEVER AGAIN. the star is for Christina. if it weren't for her, I wouldn't give any stars at all. the manager needs to be retrained, the hostesses need a class on customer service and even that might not help."}
{"text":"I would like to take a moment to extend my sincere appreciation for the service that was provided by a particular bartender named Nicole.   My husband, father, mother and I attended the Buca Di Beppo bar for 3 days and thoroughly enjoyed our food and exquisite drinks.   Nicole's skills were obviously fine tuned, her drinks were made to perfection, and her service was first class.   Due to Nicole's service, we will surely return to this location in our future travels from Florida to Las Vegas.   Kudos to Buca Di Beppo and Nicole for providing an optimum experience."}
{"text":"First time here and the service is absolutely atrocious. It's a Tuesday night and we waited over two hours for a table. Upon being seated at our table, it took nearly half an hour for our server to return and take our order. My beer has not even arrived yet.

One of my family members has celiac disease and we were told upon entering the restaurant that gluten free pasta was served here; my sister can not eat regular pasta as it makes her very sick. We waited for hours and were finally told that there was no gluten free pasta. Unacceptable. Train your staff to properly handle food allergies and stay informed about what's on the menu. 

If it were possible, I would rate this restaurant zero starts. This is a truly awful dining experience. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Customer service was terrible. I don't care how good the food is. I get it, it's a Saturday night and you wish you were off but you have a job and customer service should be a priority! Hostess doesn't even make eye contact while talking just looking down. Bartender was extremely rude and unpleasant to say the least! After 30 minutes of waiting at 10pm for our table I went back up to see how much longer and she said oh we can take you now... Pointed to a table and said go sit, took 15 minutes before we grabbed the manager ourselves, Thankfully he handled everything and made sure our food was brought out quickly."}
{"text":"I want to Thank the Catering Staff at Buca Flamingo for an exceptional experience.  We celebrated my wife's retirement after 39 years in Banking.  The party was a surprise and Buca helped in every way.  The 45 people who attended raved about the food.  Buca was already a favorite.  I highly recommend  Buca for any of your party or large group needs."}
{"text":"The wait was very long which made us late to our flight . My food was okay I had the chicken parm with fettuccine not satisfying made me burp all day. I expected more out of this place . Will definitely not come back"}
{"text":"We had a party of 11.  4 adults and 7 kids (11 to 2).   Salad and garlic bread was great.  Main courses were bland.   Service was just okay.  Restaurant wasn't busy.   Took a long time to pay."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. Service was slow and we were always waiting for something longer than normal. Food was good, but not enough sauce came on our stuffed shells. The sauce that did come with the food was dry and stuck to the plate. Not a great presentation. Waitress was nice, but seemed overwhelmed on a night that wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"I'd be surprised if this place got rated poor by anyone, the food is spectacular and the gelato is to die for. Cute dainty atmosphere and nice staff."}
{"text":"So I'm reading the previous reviews... and Buca di Beppo is a little gem?! I'm not sure I agree with that. First of all, it's not little. Secondly, it's a pretty decently known chain restaurant, so it wouldn't really be a gem in the sense that it is something to be discovered. Either way, this chain does have its value. 

Buca has become a regular place for celebratory dinners with my co-workers. We've been here a few times, but only on weekdays when it is pretty empty and easy to get a big table. The prices are pretty fair for a big group, especially after you split the meal, the drinks, and the check. The family style meal is also really fun for a big group. I like that it is a casual restaurant that allows for a dinner group to be loud and rowdy. 

As for the food, you can definitely find better and more unique Italian food at other restaurants. At Buca, the food is just mass produced on big plates so that everyone can eat like a family. Everything I've ever tried is good enough. 

Oh, and definitely get the sangria... it adds to the fun night for sure, plus it's tasty."}
{"text":"Meh. 

This is okay. Interesting kitchy atmosphere, but the food is lacking. I think Buca thrives on the \"quantity versus quality\" philosophy of most Americans when it comes to food. We ordered two large salads(antipasti and apple walnut) and a small entree for two couples. The waiter made sure we meant \"small\" and not \"large\" and seemed to be taken aback by our lack of need to gorge. The salads were good, but nothing you can't do at home...although we ALL know even a mediocre salad is better when someone ELSE makes it! The entre was sub-par. It was a \"sampler\" of a few things...that all tasted relatively the same. The stuffed shells were OVERWHELMED by the amount of fennel in the sausage. 

I would have to say that the best part was the bread. The iced tea was also good. 

An okay place if you want massive amounts of \"Olive Garden\"y Italian."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the service was poor.  They must have really overbooked Christmas parties last Friday night because our party started at 6 pm and the appetizers came out at 8, then dinner 8:30. At 9 pm, after everyone had eat'n, no one wanted to stay for dessert because they'd already been there over 3 hours.  I hope we didn't pay for the dessert with our party package, cause everyone left.  My husband owns the company we had the party for and we won't book anymore company parties here because of the poor service."}
{"text":"Dirty and horrible service. Every silverware roll we got was gross. The plates were just as bad. We had to ask to put in a drink order. We had to ask to get a set of silverware. We had to ask to get plates for our bowl of pasta, while it was sitting on the table getting cold. And best of all our server was cleaning the toilets and serving us at the same time."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of family style dining (get your fork off my plate!) so it's not exactly what I would want to do. That being said the food was awesome. Price is on the high side and I didn't like that the young hostess didn't ask us before hand how we felt about eating upstairs or walking up steps when there was an elevator there. That is something that needs to be asked right away before seating anyone. My partner in crime didn't care for that either and service can be slow at times.
I plan on going back due to the food and for that alone it gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here from start to finish. The service was exceptional and we tried one of their specialty pastas that had prosciutto, Spicy sausage and ricotta cheese. We shared a small and had leftovers for dinner the next day. Garlic bread rounded out our meal and unfortunately had no room for dessert though it looked wonderful as well. 
Love the warmth and decor of this place and hope to return sometime soon."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and the place was empty. We were seated quickly and were given some bread and butter. 

The ambience is very rustic and homely. Wall filled with pictures and painting from yesteryears. It didnt appeal to me much. 

We ordered garlic bread, vegetarian pizza, eggplant parmigiana and spicy veg rigatoni. The garlic bread was alright and had too much of whole garlic pieces on top of the bread. It was like eating just garlic alone. The vegetarian pizza was awful and didnt taste good. There was too much broccoli. The hit on the table was the eggplant parmigiana and spicy veg rigatoni. Eggplant was breaded and fried, it was topped with tomato based sauce and tasted delicious. Rigatoni pasta was one of the best I have had, the sauce was delicious and we wanted to just go on eating. 

Any one who visits this place should know the quantity is huge. Overall a good place to go with a huge crowd and the price is average."}
{"text":"A little overdone, I know, but I like chowing down here from time to time. First off, though, it's important to know going in that portions here are ginormous. If they say it serves 2, it actually probably serves 3 or 4. If they say something serves 3 or 4, it's probably 5 or 6. And so on and so forth. You get the idea. 

They have a few special eating areas, including the pope room, for larger groups, and the kitchen table, which is right in the middle of all the action. The kitchen table is a perfect conversation starter for dates and keeps things interesting throughout the course of your meal. 

Just be sure to get some to-go boxes when you're ready to go . . ."}
{"text":"7:30pm Saturday night and they ran out of pizza!!!!   How does that happen?   Also didn't have a specific beer on tab.  Still waiting on tea refill too!   Unfortunately our first time and probably last.   Our waitress, Shelby, wasn't very attentive, and we felt she was a little condescending.    We also noticed she boxed up another tables leftovers but didn't offer to do ours.   And to top the night, the credit card system went down and it had to be done manually.   No discounts for all this bullshit.   Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Although this restaurant has an awesome name, the quality of the place has gone down hill significantly. There was no host when we arrived, so we found our way to the bar. The bartender was absent but there were large open plastic containers of san Gris sitting around. After waiting for a while and asking two people, we were finally able to land a menu and place an order. The food was average. The service felt like we were an inconvenience instead of a welcome customer. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible! Whatever you do, do not eat here, go anywhere else.

We came here on a slow lunch day--I mean the place was practically empty.

The services was painfully slow, took so long just to get acknowledged and the food took even longer.

The portions are huge and the food was gross. We ordered a chicken fettuccine and bread sticks. The food was gooey and clumpy, and the bread sticks were chewy. 

This place makes Olive Garden look like a 5 start restaurant.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with some friends. Jarrett was our waiter and he was extremely helpful in describing the menu, providing recommendations, and constantly checking in with us for refills. Great food and excellent service by Jarrett. Would happily come back again and enjoy having him as our server."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  There was just the 2 of us and she doesn't do marinara and I don't like alfredo much, so we shared a pepperoni pizza and ceasar salad.  I really like the food there.  Will have to return at some point.  Oh, one more thing, our server was on her 2nd day there and she was amazing!  I wish I could remember her name, but she got a very fat tip that evening"}
{"text":"It's Buca Di Beppo.  The food is going to be mediocre Italian because that's the type of restaurant it is.

Our waitress must have had something against my father in law.  She was rude when we sat down, she didn't take his drink order, and she didn't bring him water.  Too bad he was the one paying.

But the food was good and it came out quickly.  She eventually warmed to my father in law and he got his drink and was happy enough.  

Three stars because you know what you are getting food-wise when you walk in.  Service makes or breaks chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is always great! Family style eating so be careful when ordering"}
{"text":"Thank god this Buca has the old menu!

Linguine with meat sauce
Veal Parmesan 
Fried Cheese

I love their fried cheese, it doesn't look or taste like it came from the Sam's Club freezer. Their Veal Parmesan is also amazingly good for a chain restaurant. It comes out crisp even though it is covered with sauce. I don't make it hear very often due to the abundance of local restaurants in the city, but when it gets late or I am close I have no issue stopping by."}
{"text":"Wow was I impressed my the professionalism of this place.   II ordered   chicken parm .    The meal came and it was very nice.   After 5 minutes the manager can over and apologized that they brought me veal   parm and told me my dinner was on the house.!   I love both I was happy either way but I was really impressed with the admission of an error and that they thought the right thing to do was comp then whole meal.  A few minutes later the manager brought over the  chicken.   They earned me respect!   Too bad I will probably never come back to los Vegas but they earned my loyalty  !"}
{"text":"The bread, the wine, the MEATBALLS, pasta, shrimp, more wine!!! All perfecto ! And location at station square is amazing"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restraunt! We loved the chicken pasta!"}
{"text":"Greg, our server, was wonderful. He made our dinner so special. Veal, mozzarella Salad, and bread were delicious.   You must try the Sicilian Punch at the bar for happy hour! Those were so good!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5

Pretty hearty big italian family meal. Liked the concept of this restaurant... alot actually, its presenting a nice family experience in Station Square. This was my first time in the square, and we didn't get a reservation at our first choice restaurant, so we came here. Good experience... delicious italian food that everyone shared. Older establishment but nonetheless a good personal experience with family/friends- WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. 

Pictures everywhere... not the fanciest eatery, little pricey- but you share. Deserves a better rating than a 2.5, perhaps a 3+."}
{"text":"In 2004, my employer was doing construction nearby. An employee from BdB dropped by with cannolis and some other food to welcome us. They gave us catering menus. We later used them for group business dinners--nice stmosphere, great food, good facility. And I do \"to go\" orders maybe 3 or 4 times a year.  Just did their lunch offer a few weeks ago. All of this from a simple gesture of cannolis!"}
{"text":"Yeah don't do it. We came and had a reservation which they didnt have. Waited 20 min to be seated and then they have one server for 12 tables. No drink refill. My son had to walk up to the server for a drink refill. I get they are short staffed but an almost 2 hr lunch is not worth it."}
{"text":"We have stayed away from Buca di Beppo because of their reputation for huge portions.  We would be in the area for an appointment and decided to go here after for an early dinner.  As form the portions, we're at the age where early dinners and take home boxes rule!  :)

I had checked the menu online and knew pretty much what we wanted before going there.  Our server, Casey, was a gem!  She asked us if we had been there before and answered questions and gave advice as we asked.

We ended up ordering a small portion of their summer tricolore salad.  It was a good starter of sliced tomatoes, mozzarella, and avocado rings topped with fresh basil and olive oil.  A very summery kind of salad.

For our main course, we chose the spicy chicken rigatoni described on the menu as chicken breast, garlic, crushed red pepper and peas in a spicy rosa sauce.  This came with a recommendation from a friend and it was a good suggestion.  (Thanks Shawn H.)  The bowl of rigatoni was huge.  Note that the menu states that a small order is meant for 2 or more and a large order is meant for 4 or more.  We had generous servings at the restaurant, not overdoing it though, and we brought home a container for an additional meal.  The take home packaging even had a reheating instruction sticker on it.  

Since we didn't overdo the main course, we had room for dessert.  They have a couple of desserts that have single serving versions (well actually they're also for 2 people in reality).  We got their single serving version of the colossal brownie sundae.  It came with two brownie pieces, two scoops of ice cream and some whipped cream.  A very nice dessert for two people to share.

I was very pleased with this first visit to a Buca.  Considering the amount of food, the price is reasonable.  Service was outstanding.  Thanks, Casey!  We'll be back to try some other things.  And, by bringing home a box, it saves me from having to cook a meal on a future day.  Score!"}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo is one of my favorite restaurants. The food was good tonight but not the best I've ever had from this restaurant. The chicken parmesan was not as crispy as I would like but the service was great and the staff was amazing. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"My wife and I always joke that we are going to go here and eat. We have both been there in the past and the place is simply overrated. I would rather eat at Olive Garden for better Italian food which doesn't say much. Go elsewhere for Italian food."}
{"text":"Meh about says it.  I've been to this place a bunch of times.  In hindsight I don't know why.  Italian is one of my favorite foods and I've never had anything, other than the garlic bread, that really stands out here.  Yeah the inside is neat and the staff is always good... but the pasta sauce is nothing special.  Everything seems like bland Italian food, in comparison of the many other options in the category especially.  It also isn't cheap.  For chain Italian restaurants, I'd take Olive Garden, Carabba's, Brio.  

Also, I somehow end up with in this place with work people or friends that don't like some damn thing.  I'll eat everything, but considering the menu is just OK as it is, I end up getting stuck with the most mediocre dish at a medicre restaurant.  This makes me want to stab someone.  Family style is great if you are with your family, if you are with a bunch of vegetarians... REDRUM! REDRUM!  Yeah yeah, I can get individual orders now.  So I can be THAT guy, that goes to a family style restaurant and is like, NO, I'm ordering my own thing, you all suck.  While YES, that is totally true, I don't want everyone to necessarily know it.  Pizza places is where you are supposed to go with a group of people and argue about what to order, not pasta places."}
{"text":"I had dinner the day before because its near to me I love to go to Bucca. If you wanna have a family time with real italian food its a great place. The one i go to a the excalibur is a busy joint so don't expect quite ambiance. Most of the food are flavored in garlic, I am not huge fun but like it."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice, once for prom in 2005 and then again for a friend's birthday in 2013 so my review is a bit dated. 

Obviously it was completely packed the first time I came in, I ordered a pasta dish with clams that had maybe 4 pieces of meat in the entire thing, it was good but for the price it definitely wasn't worth it.

The next time we decided to go all out between four people. We got two appetizers to split, one being a salad and the other a stuffed chicken breast. The stuffed chicken breast was amazing and we all agreed. Even the salad was very good...until we found a large horse fly after finishing almost the entire thing.

Now I'm not squeamish about finding insects in my food, in fact I'm pretty understanding and rarely even make a fuss about it but when we brought it to the server's attention we were treated like we were over reacting.

Again we probably wouldnt have over reacted had it not taken nearly half an hour to even get our appetizers, or if we had really been acknowledged in any way most of the time we were there. So we got a bit heated about the matter and the server was KIND enough to give us the salad for free, nothing else was comped in our order and the rest of the time we were there we were treated like they just wanted us to leave. 

We hadn't been rude nor did we even demand anything be done about the fly but it made our entrees less than enjoyable. In fact I don't even remember what we got! Definitely won't be coming back to this place when there's infinitely better options out there.

It's just an overpriced rip off of Olive Garden that doesn't even taste as good, with poor service."}
{"text":"The bad link in the chain...
On any given day I am a big Buca lover, I go to a few times a week to the Summerlin location, but today I had family to meet across town and made the unfortunate suggestion for this location.
Starters: Buca trio; 
      Calamari ( over cooked to a blackened shame of it's former self)
      Stuffed mushrooms ( cold like they had just been sitting out until some happened to order the poor things)
       Fried mozzarella ( soaking in marinara that seemed mostly comprised of water)
Entrees:
       Penne Basilica the sauce was the only saving grace, the chicken was \"curiously\" soft and squishy, as was the pasta. Oh and the broccoli? Oops sorry they were out, at 6 pm..
       Chicken Parmesan: I could let the burn edges go, if the rest wasn't soaking in the same tomato water excuse for marinara sauce. 
       Sausage Ziti: could you possibly believe they made sausage and sauce too bland to finish? Yeah my brother was shocked too.
The icing on the cake? Food took over an hour to get to the table after the appetizer."}
{"text":"Raw meatballs, don't like the way the menu is set up, I want a side salad, I don't want a one man salad bar."}
{"text":"I wondered why I hadn't been to this place before....then we had a $50 gift card, so we went there, and now I know why.  While the service was amazing, the food was eh and expensive.

No doubt that I am an Italian snob.  Yes, living in Italy spoiled me and I decide whether a place is a good Italian place based upon its ability to provide amazing gnocchi.  This place is not Italian.  It is better to define it as Italian-American.  Large portions.

There is a charge for bread.  A charge for pasta.  A charge for vegetable.  I sent the green beans back because they tasted like someone poured lemon juice on them.  I didn't think it was possible to mess up green beans, but yes, they made it happen.

It was really expensive for eh Italian food.  I can make better at home.  I will stick to the authentic places in town and there is plenty.  Maybe this is the place for a large group meal for kids going to prom, not for two adults."}
{"text":"it's good family style italian, just make sure you bring the family."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 1800 on Valentine's Day for our first time experiencing Buca, we arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation and checked in. 

I witnessed people show up 20-45 minutes LATE for their reservations and even a group of 6 that made reservations for next Monday get sat prior to us in a 40 minute time span. Needless to say it was very irritating and standing waiting for 50 minutes in a sardine can environment to be sat did not help. 

At this point we were finally at our table and I really had little faith that this would be even a decent dining experience. 

Then walked up our server Jarrett. He started to turn the experience around with his great attitude and service. Very personable and not overbearing, he allowed us to enjoy our meal without trying to push us out the door and turn tables. If you go I highly recommended asking for his area. 

The food was great, I was pretty impressed with the salad. We had some garlic bread with a side of marinara and that was another turning point. If you have fresh tasty sauce the basis of the food will be good! The lasagna was great and the cannolis proper though I would have asked for no chocolate sauce. 

Overall the freshness and quantity of food to price is very good, we have lunch and dinner leftover! 

Jarrett and the good food definitely turned things around and made us a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Second or third time I've ever been to Buca. Second time at this location. I know some of my buddies aren't too impressed with this chain but it's not a bad place for some good authentic Italian food. Why is it good? Because my Italian friend said so.

The parking lot is pretty small as well as the restaurant itself. When you first walk in, you're greeted by the maitre'D. The waiting area is kind of small with two benches for convenience and comfort. Actually, it's not that the area is small but more cluttered.

All the dishes are available in small and large portions. Small portions are suitable for 3 person parties while the large portions can (supposedly) satisfy 6 people.

Environment: From ceiling to floor, the walls are decorated with Italian decor and pictures of their glory days including \"Miss Buca\" of several years. The seating areas look antique which correlates well with the rest of the facility.

Waiter:waitresses; not too bad. We ordered a lot if food and that have been the underlying reason for her many visits to our table. Regardless, she did a good job of making sure my buddies were happy and satisfied. Most impressive was the fact that she memorized our entire customized order. No pen and pad. Just memorization.

Food: Started off the night with French bread with wine and vinegar for dipping sauce. Nothing unusual or extraordinary. For appetizer, we ordered the large spicy calamari which is basically the \"fried calamari\" dish cooked with banana peppers for a nice kick. Slices of roasted banana peppers were used to garnish the fried seafood. Marinara mixed with garlic sauce added the perfect salty taste to complement the spicy and flavorful morsels of squid. For entrees, we had 3 dishes, pizza and two chicken selections. The pizza was a thin crust masterpiece covered with a small layer of fresh tomato sauce and melted cheese. Sausage and roasted tomato were scattered on top of the rectangular shaped pizza. The crust was crunchy on the bottom and slightly chewy on the top. The cheese was perfectly melted so that with each bite, you had to check your chin to make sure no residual cheese remained. Nothing spectacular about the sausage. The first chicken dish was slightly fried and covered in pesto sauce. The chicken was stuffed with mozzarella which oozed out with every bite. YUM! The last chicken dish was unremarkable in every way. Covered with a white cream sauce and capers.

Drinks: diet pepsi (they don't have coke).

Recommendation: EAT!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, went with a friend on a Saturday. Amazing pasta and variety of items. What makes it even better is the fact that they walk you through their kitchen before sitting you down on a table. Awesome food and good waiters. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"i have to revise my review of their customer service. The food was excellent and the cost was reasonable for a big group of people, no problem with that!  As for service, we all can have a bad day and still be a great place to take the family. I will go back again after hearing how much they do care about their customers. Thank you."}
{"text":"Food was average. Al a cart, so no pasta served with the chicken Pamasian (which came with 3 patties on a plate). Service is very slow. One waitress tonight (Friday) for 13 tables. She was friendly but not good at multitasking and often forgot things (took my salad fork but didn't bring me a diner one, no water refill etc). 
Left over pans brought to table. Never trust me to box anything with marinara... just saying."}
{"text":"absolutely atrocious. I went here with a friend and we ordered a smallish pizza which was hugely overpriced and we waited an hour to get it. It was unbelievably greasy (the greasiest pizza I've ever seen) and was undercooked despite the long wait time. When you peeled the cheesy scab like structure back you could see the undercooked dough. sad!"}
{"text":"Pretty bummed that you have to order delivery 24 hours in advanced :(. Only reason why I'm ranking this place a 3 star but I do enjoy the food!!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. We used to go to the Seattle location, and it was top notch. This was literally worse than an Olive Garden (which can be OK). We had the individual meals on the lunch menu. Soggy salad, no bread, soft spaghetti. Yuck. The server was asking everyone to go to a website and give her 5 stars, and she would give us a free dessert. Everyone did. We lied for free cake. Don't bother doing lunch here. Better Italian in the Luxor food court."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. My boyfriend and I got seated all the way in the back in a corner when they weren't even busy. SAT THERE FOR OVER 20 minutes and no one ever came back to even get our drink order in. Absolute disgrace. We left after sitting there in the cold dark corner BUT on our way out, we see a waitress sitting at the bar shooting the breeze with the bartender. And then all the rest of the teenage working crew was huddled around the front door WASHING THE WINDOW GLASS. Then the cherry on top was the hostess quoting \"thanks guys have a good night!\" Yeah, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I have dined here now a TOTAL of 6 times....  Each time, TRYING HARD to find the place to be \"excellent\"...  And each time, walking away disappointed in one aspect or another of this restaurant.
This last Sunday (July 31st, 2016), I took advantage of an emailed coupon for 50% off their Lasagna.  Sadly, the Lasagna was FANTASTIC the first trip into this store (5 trips before) - I order it each and every time I have come back and it is NEVER the same?  (Although one trip back  - again a 50% off coupon for Lasagna - they had RUN OUT OF LASA"}
{"text":"The pipes were dripping from the ceiling onto my face and the bartender told me it was the air conditioning vents! Not a great eating atmosphere"}
{"text":"After reading and hearing rave reviews of how great this place and since it's conveniently located across the street from my hotel, I decided to try this place. As I walked in for my reservation, I was greeted and provided a tour around the restaurant, which although part of a ubiquitous chain, maintains a traditional Italian look. My guest and I decided we were going to order a bottle of their house white wine, small order of \"mozzarella\" garlic bread, chicken parm with spaghetti, and a salad . Although I had a great impression because of their customer service, I had to deduct a star because even though on the menu it states \"mozzarella garlic bread\", the mozzarella cheese was practically nonexistent--which was unfortunate since I love cheese-- and the garlic bread was mediocre; hard Italian bread, cut up into small squares. Also, if you order the chicken parm, don't expect a free complementary side as the chicken parm comes by itself so, of course, we had to order spaghetti. On a brighter note, the salad was great, so I recommend ordering that! I spent $92, which I felt was kinda pricey considering that lackluster garlic bread."}
{"text":"Good food.......too expensive though......i'd rather pay less and take home less leftovers.
After living 30 yrs in ny......fresh bread.....no...good fresh bread is absolutely
A must in an italian restaurant.
Worst cold bread ever!
Sorry buca......its the truth.....even the server admitted she hears this from customers.
Want insane bread....check out BABBO !! Yum!!!

Ps....my girlfriends Buca ravioli were really good !!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Was given the option when making reservations for 6:15pm or noon for thanksgiving dinner. Arrive at 6:09pm for our party of 2 reservations at 6:15pm and told 30-45 min wait. What's the point of reservations? I have myself and my disabled mother. No place for her to sit. Just had surgery for brain cancer and the hostess couldn't even give us a seat at the bar. We have been this establishment as a thanksgiving tradition for 7 years now, between the Scottsdale location and Seattle. This will be the last year we continue this tradition due to the fact that you have to wait 45 minutes after your reservation. Very unprofessional. Disappointed to say the least. I only make these reservations to take my mom here because she loves this place even though they have mediocre Italian food.

Had to edit this review. We were seated 30 minutes after our reservation. While walking through the kitchen to be seated, a server turned around and ran into my disabled mother and her walker. She then got yelled at by another staff. The table we were sat at was set for 6 people when only 2 of us, the first chair I grabbed was broken as well as the chair my mom sat in. This place has gone down hill. Would compare this place to a Denny's.

7:51pm... no food yet. Took 45 minutes to get out appetizer. We're now 10 minutes past the time our server told us our food would be out at max... normally I wouldn't complain but this is thanksgiving.. not a single face in here looks happy and all we're hearing about is \"how busy we are..\"

Update, food arrived 1.5 hours after we were sat 30 minutes late. Stuffed shells were hard and over done with barely any cheese on top. The stuffed prosciutto chicken had barely any prosciutto inside and was extremely dry. Server took it back. The bread was all cold, frozen butter... desert took 15 minutes to arrive when ordered. Been to these establishments all over the USA, this will be the last time we ever visit. Terrible food, terrible service, terrible management due to the under staffed holiday."}
{"text":"My father in law got sausage that was clearly too hot. The stuff was very accommodating and brought out extra sausage for him to bring home. Over all great decor good food great service. See ya next Easter!"}
{"text":"There aren't many things I get w.red sauce bc mine is best, of course   But, once again, the eggplant Parma & fettuccine alfredo were excellent. I love that the eggplant is sliced thicker than many places, it's crispy, tender & isn't swimming in sauce (got some on the side). The way they stack it leaves part of the cutlet plain, which I really enjoy! Requested al dente pasta, which had just the right about of rich, creamy sauce for my liking. I did add black pepper and more grated cheese.  Had it delivered via a Doordash w. a current special $1.99 fee. Lunch portion & I have a 2nd meal. $17.99 w.all"}
{"text":"Despite Yelp claiming the minimum order for delivery is $20, the woman on the phone just told me the minimum order for deliveries $100.  That's less than acceptable, and regardless of the quality of the food, the bait-and-switch is undeniably unnecessary and rotten."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed this dining experience.  The server was great and knowledgeable.   The food was good, even the chef came out to greet us!  The decor was quite interesting.  They even had a pope room with his head on a lazy Susan!"}
{"text":"The baked ziti was superb! For a healthy portion of high quality pasta under $13 it's the best value in the area. My fiancé and I devoured it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant and I am glad that we did. The decor of the restaurant immediately grabs the patron from the time one walks in the door until you leave. I love the pictures and images all over the restaurant it gives it flair and a sense of old Vegas. The low level lighting at the booth we were sitting at was so elegant too.

Our server was so gentle and welcoming he assisted us with all the menu questions that we did have. The menu that they do have is in true Italian fashion and encourages sharing which we did. The menu does specify that too that the small serving is for about 3 people and the larger servings are for 5-7. We ordered a small pepperoni pizza and still took home left overs between myself and my twins. We also had the mini meatballs and they were so good that we ended up with two orders of them. The mini meatballs are made from scratch and have mozzarella inside of them. 

After eating I did save room for dessert too since I have heard they do it here the best. We ordered the brownie sundae and it was huge. It was full of brownie bites, vanilla and chocolates ice cream with Carmel sauce through it. Then on top was whipped cream all over with colorful rainbow sprinkles. It does not get better than that ! It was so large that I could not even finish it, even with the twins. Next time I'll order dessert first."}
{"text":"I wonder when the interior designers snuck into my Gramma's house and got the ideas for the interior of these restaurants? They have all the knick-knacks that every Italian household had. I still remember every room had a picture of Jesus, one whole wall of my Gramma's kitchen was decorated with calenders, why you ask? They were colorful, and everyone from banks, to churches to the local funeral parlor gave them out at Christmas time, they were a cheap way to decorate, no lie! Italians loved colorful little things that they could put everywhere, and this is what you get at Buca di Beppo.

The food's not bad either, I had a dish that was pasta with a delicious plumb tomato and fresh herb sauce. I swear the \"single\" serve lunch special was a pound and a half of pasta and easily twelve ounces of sauce. Was it authentic? Nah, not in the least. Was it good? Damn right it was, fresh herbs kick the flavors of everything up. The waiter started off the lunch by bringing over a few baskets of warm bread, and \"making\" a dipping \"sauce\" as we called it back in the day. he mixed some olive oil, dried herbs and balsamic vinegar on a plate, we all dug in!  Gramma would cut her home made bread and heat up a little olive oil with smashed garlic, add salt and pepper and we'd dip our bread into it for an authentic Italian lunch. We'd also have dried salami, chunks of Romano cheeses and fresh fruit with wine. That's the way we used to eat back when I was growing up with my \"Little Gramma\". 

Buca also has giant meatballs, lasagna, ravioli, and a pretty darn good looking sicilian style pizza done only with flesh mozzerella, and fresh basil on a bed of simple sauce. Come hungry and be prepared to take home lots of doggie bags."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit about once a month for our 'date night'.  Love the food (usually get the Quattro al Forno which is a sampler; and the Mixed Green salad). Sometimes the service is great, sometimes its just ok.  We keep coming back as it's a nice change from Olive Garden, which is the only other Italian restaurant on the north side of town."}
{"text":"We got there during a quiet time and it was nice. The service was great, but those who cleaned a new by table really need to be aware that customers can hear you talking. It is a shame because they complained for a bit before they changed subjects.

The food was delicious and plentiful. I would definitely hit them up again, and hopefully they will fix their \"to go cup\" problem as they didn't have lids for the Mimi's Cafe cups they used."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of Italian family members after a funeral viewing. For such a large restaurant I felt like they squished us in a corner with 12+ people. Blocking a fire exit... Anyways
The salad we started with was full of flavor and yummy! We tried the Cesar and Italian chop (I think that's what it was called). 
I asked the waitress what sizes to order and she suggested 4 large dinner pastas. It was way way too much food but it was nice to try a variety. The fritta de mar will always be my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great place for a huge group. They have huge portions, so order carefully. I loved the food here."}
{"text":"Family style with some coworkers, we had a very affordable dinner for the 3 of us with the small sized portions. Our waitress was attentive and our meal was quite tasty. I wouldnt give them 4 stars as our waitress did forget to bring us our bread and marinara sauce and needed to be reminded but other than that, the atmostphere was clever, the food was yummy and our drinks were decent."}
{"text":"This restaurant is next to Carolina Place Mall. They serve family style. A small size  feeds two people and a large size feeds four people. This restaurant is decorated with bunch of antique pictures and it has plenty of seats and tables inside. I bought two Groupon deals for this restaurant. Both times the services were great. The hostess or host will give you a kitchen tour. They will serve you bread in the beginning. We had the cheesy bread sticks and they were delicious. Nice and warm. Their portions are huge. The first time we had the spaghetti marinara and it was good. The second time we went we had Beppo\"s Soffici Cuscini and the small size was huge for two people. We did have a brownie sundae and it was big as my head. It was enough for four people to eat it. In my opinion the restaurant wasn't loud. A wonderful place for family to dine in. Without the Groupon deal it is pricey. A small size runs between 14-22 dollars."}
{"text":"Went to Buca di Beppo because we were in the area and were starving for food, all the other local restaurants were in big box shopping centers and were crammed with people.

We ordered salad, pizza, and baked rigatoni. The food came out in bizarre order.... Pizza first, then 10 minutes later, the salad arrived. 20 minutes after that we still didn't have our rigatoni and finally asked the server to remove it from our bill and we cut our losses.

Food quality was meh. I've had much better. I'd say, if you have a whole family to feed, and you don't care about mediocre food, this is the place to go. Big portions, served family style. Don't expect ambiance, great service, quick kitchen, or well-prepared food. But for groups on the cheap, who aren't picky, it's not bad."}
{"text":"I love Buca di Beppo! The food is delicious, the service is great and the atmosphere is definitely inviting and intimate. I've been to this location several times on a dinner date and was seated in a small intimate dining area, I guess meant for couples. 

One thing I don't like about this restaurant or many \"Italian\" restaurant is how diming lit it is. I like to be able to see my food and see the face of the person I'm eating with, but lighting is so dark in here. I know it's supposed to help make the place seem more intimate, but it's not my thing. 

Service has always been quick and efficient. Always seated fairly immediately and our waiter/waitress are very quick to come and take our drink/food order. Since I usually came before the dinner rush, we never had to wait too long for our food to come out. They bring you complimentary house bread and butter while you are waiting. The bread is a hit or miss. The last time I came, the bread was pretty hard and dry. I didn't end up finishing my slice since it seemed old. 

Our food, on the other hand, was so good! All their dishes are served family-style so you can share dishes. Their small servings serve 2-3 people and their large servings serve up to 5 people. This could change depending on how hungry you are when you come. For me and my date, small was more than enough for us. We would normally order a salad and two entrees and share. Take home about half of our order for another meal is always a plus. 

The Caesar salad is my favorite of their salads that I've tried. Everything is pretty perfect about it. Lettuce is always fresh and crisp. Only thing I'd change would be to add a bit more dressing to the salad as it seemed pretty dry for a salad. 

Their Chicken Parmigiana is soooo good! The chicken is perfectly breaded and cooked. Was not dry at all and the flavor was delicious with the just perfect amount of marinara sauce. Another of my favorites here is the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni. Yum Yum YUM!! Was not at all spicy for me, so I added more crushed red pepper on top and then it was perfect. Penne alla Vodka is another great choice as well as their Baked Ziti, Cheese manicotti. The Penne alla Vodka could definitely use more sauce, but it was well seasoned and the pasta was perfectly cooked. 

Our server came around often to check up on us and refilled our drinks often. They are super friendly and love to make conversation with you. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We went on Christmas day with the family of 8. Granted it was Christmas and it was very busy. We waited forever for our food and mentioned it to the server and she said she would send the manager by. The proprietor owner came by and mentioned that it was Christmas and they were busy, no compassion what so ever. Dinner arrived cold and tasteless with on entree missing. When it arrived we were almost finished and sent it back. The server was not to blame and I know that working on a holiday is not fun (but she was super nice). I have worked many Christmases in the industry. Needless to say we have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"Actually, I cannot get full stars because the food was not very tasty but the atmosphere is really good they were so friendly but we were waiting for food for 30 minutes.we ordered calamari was not very good but the spicy shrimp was so delicious."}
{"text":"I've never had to run out of somewhere fearing that they'd come and chase us down but this place was just horrible."}
{"text":"generally, i'm not a fan of 'family style' restaurants.  as mentioned in other reviews the service was mediocre; however, the baked ziti and the chicken parm were above average.   if you've ever read any of my other reviews you'll find that's a lot coming from me.  the 'heaviness' of the meal was what it's suppose to be which is basically sicilian.  i've lived in nyc and was born in philadelphia; consequently, i found the cost not bad.  we had four adults and two children and our bill was under $100."}
{"text":"A little late but I still wanted to get this out.

Came here for dinner to celebrate my graduation. We booked the Kitchen Table, which we were quite excited about. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, only to realize the restaurant had mistakenly double booked the Kitchen Table. The guy from the other party was being a total d*ck, so we decided to let them have the Kitchen Table, especially after the manager (Lorenzo) said he'd let us have our own private dining room and give us a discount.  Plus, we were a tad disappointed that the Kitchen Table, wasn't really in the kitchen...kinda deceiving, if you ask me. We will book the Kitchen Table at the San Diego location next time we go, cause at least that table is in the kitchen, hence the name. 
We sat down in our own private dining area and as Lorenzo promised, we were the only ones in there.  We literally had the waitress (Jennabea) all to ourselves!  It was very nice; Jennabea was fantastic and incredibly attentive!

Anyhow...so the food, as you should know, it's all served family style, and as always, it was all very delicious. Everyone loved their food, there wasn't much left on the plate.  In fact, I had to push my plate away in order to to stop eating.. ha!

I don't give places 5 stars that often, but in this case, 5 stars is necessary thanks to Lorenzo and Jennabea!"}
{"text":"Whether you are at City Walk, Brea shopping plaza, or any other city with Buca, its the same food, just different state. Same Birthday song, same drinks. Difference, it's at the Excalibur in Fabulous Las Vegas! So if you like the same cheesy garlic bread, the same pasta and chicken, then albiet, you'll love this place.

Service was good, especially for the party size we had.

Oh, no walk through the kitchen?! No Kitchen table, and No different rooms. I was so hoping to get the Pope's table. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and the food was absolutely delicious!!  Starting with the bread that was so fresh and yummy. The ceasar salad was excellent except the croutons seemed like they were out of a box. The Buca trio platter was very tasty. We got the large lasagne and large shrimp florentine. There was more than plenty for the five of us. Our waitress was Katie and she was excellent. Kept our drinks filled and was quite attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very cozy setting and interesting pictures display on the walls also hand painted people gone wrong. Maybe the wall painting it's mean to be funny because they looked awkward.

The food is served family style, huge portions. Spaghetti, eggplant Parmesan so on. 

In this restaurant it seems the quality of food is not that important but the quantity is.

Overall the food was really okay, but our waiter was fabulous!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas and were invited here by some local acquaintances, we had never eaten at this establishment before.  We ordered the Cesar Salad, Mix Green Salad, Chicken Limone, Baked Rigatoni, and traditional Spaghetti with Meat Sauce.  We found it really sub-par, typical Italian chain food.  The staff was good.  What surprised us most was the crowd waiting outside.  I doubt we'll ever try this chain again."}
{"text":"Worst Experience Ever!The server we had was a young lady by the name of Bailey. We ordered the Baked Rigatoni without meat and the Mount Vesuvius for dessert. We specifically told the waitress that we had an allergy to pork and requested that the dish that we ordered be served without pork. Bailey later came back after 10 minutes stating that they currently aren't serving the Mount Vesuvius, she didn't offer any alternative desserts either. I became upset at this point because she should have informed us before that they weren't serving it at the beginning. We were in the middle of eating our chicken when we realized that there was pork inside it. We brought this to the attention of our waitress Bailey and she apologized and took all our plates which had our baked rigatoni. We were very disappointed that she didn't ownership of her mistake and the fact that she took most of the rigatoni as well. The least that she could have done was gave us another serving to make up for that. We decided that she didn't deserve a tip after that ordeal. When we went to the bathroom,she later followed me and my friends and screamed at us for giving her a $0.00 tip. This made us very upset, we couldn't believe she had the nerve to scream at us over the tip when she wasn't a good waitress. After this horrible experience, we will never go to Buca di Beppo again and have told friends and family not to dine at this restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the food worse.  It took over 30 minutes just for the staff to ask about drinks.  The Caesar Salad was wilted and brown!! The baked ziti was overcooked and lacked flavor.  We had 2 drinks, small salad and small pasta....bill was $65.00 WTF!!  It was my daughter's birthday and they would not honor a coupon for a free appetizer,  that was presented due to it being an \"internet hoax\".   NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I visited the Chandler, AZ location today with my family. We always visit Bucas the day after Christmas, it's become our tradition! There are 14 of us so the large portions were wonderful and the space is able to accommodate us all comfortably. We ordered calamari first which was delicious. We then got a gorgonzola salad, pizza, spicy pasta and carbonara. All items were tasty. The prices are on the high side but this is expected given the large portions. The service was a bit slow which was disappointing because it was not very full there. There was also an odd odor which brought the ambiance down a tad. However, my family enjoyed themselves and we will likely be back next year."}
{"text":"Buca isn't what it used to be. It's gone corporate and it seems their primary focus is the bottom line. It looks and tastes the same but the prices were inflated,  portions small and ingredients skimpy. 

We went on a Friday night and the place was maybe a quarter occupied. Used to be jam packed with a wait on a weekend night. 

The 3 of us ordered the smaller sizes of one appetizer, one salad, one main pasta dish, and one drink. Plus tax and tip = $75 = totally not worth it!

The bread they brought out was half a loaf of some lame ass generic 50 cent roll. They used to serve at least two different kinds of specialty bread. The marinara sauce served with the fried calamari was watery and served in a tiny cup. The chopped antipasto salad used to be full of olives, peppercinis, and large slices of meats and cheeses; it was mostly lettuce this time. The frutti di mare linguini used to be made with generous amounts of seafood; it was very soupy and contained so little of everything this time.

Again, the decor was still fun and the taste was the same, but we were extremely disappointed with every other aspect. They even went cheap on the napkins.

Buca went from being a basement in name only to just plain basement quality. We'll never go back again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to have lunch with your hubby. The lunch portions are large enough for left overs . the wonderful waitress and the music topped off our meal.  Thank you to the chef and assist chefs for the miraculous flavors which melted in our mouths.  If I could have I would have given 10 stars. We are looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with meatballs. It was mushy and had no taste whatsoever! You can't say this is an Italian restaurant if you cant make meatballs. The sauce had no flavor it tasted like canned tomato. GROSS"}
{"text":"Service was poor.  Hostesses did not seem to want to be there.  Server was ok.  Food was good but not exceptional.  Very disappointed and won't likely be back.  Staff needs to be trained to have better customer service.  Seemed to care less!"}
{"text":"I feel like this place is more about the kitsch factor than the food.  It's made to look like your Italian-American grandmother's house, with pictures and knick knacks all over the wall a la Applebee's.  There are family characters and witty sayings all over the (huge) menu.

That's all well and good, but the food is nothing special.  We shared calamari (warning: they serve the rings AND the tentacles.  Don't order this if you're tentacle squeamish.) and the big pasta sampler of all their baked specialties--the stuffed shells were pretty good, lot of fennel and sausage, but other than that I just didn't get any big flavors from the meal.

Honestly, the advertisements for Italian supermarket brands (cheese, sauce, etc.) in the menu made me wish that I had cooked an Italian meal for myself at home because quite frankly, I can do better than Buca."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with the catering staff from this location. After a horrible situation at another location, I can truly say that the Christine, from catering has once again shown me that Buca di Peppo is amazing.  I am a medical sales educator and do a lot of lunch presentations. My order was simple, the lasagna was amazing and I would definitely suggest this catering men
u to pharmaceutical reps.  Easy,  convenient, and your offices will love the food quality. Thank you Christine for restoring my faith in Buca."}
{"text":"Can you imagine the tackiest, most stereotypical interpretation of Italian American culture?   If you can't, just drop by and check out the decor at Buca di Beppo.   

So, forget the decor.  How's the food?   Well, the portions are quite large, and the flavor is equally common.  From the first bite, you will know you are at a low level chain restaurant that doesn't have a real chef on staff.  Do you want a real Italian culinary experience?  Go to Il Fornaio or the likes. This is the Pizza Hut version of Italian dining.  Eat too much, leave stuffed and yet less than satisfied.  

Then, dessert.... enjoy your diabetic coma if you get the Colossal Chocolate Brownie Sundae.  It is as big as a football.  Don't order unless there is at least 5 people to eat it.  Seriously huge.  

As for this local restaurant, it was very understaffed at lunchtime, nevertheless, when they finally got around to serving us, they were very friendly.  It is the ownership's fault it is not properly staffed, not the employees' fault.  

In a nutshell, there are much better choices for Italian dining.  Choose one."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place and it f wasn't too bad! I got the veal saltimbocca and it started off tasting good but then it seemed to be a bit greasy! The service was good and I did enjoy the Frank Sinatra music!"}
{"text":"waiter dropped my wallet which was ON THE TABLE. Question: how do you drop someones wallet off the table. You would literally have to pick up my wallet and drop it. 

Then she recklessly set it back on the table. She literally fucking puts my wallet on my plate of food with tomato sauce. My MK wallet was dipped into my plate filled with tomato sauce. What. The. Fuck. I told her what she did and just gave me a napkin from another dish that was on my table. What. The. Fuck.
This place deserves 0 stars if anything."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. It feels like they've lost all their passion for creating a fun environment with good food. Just another chain with folks who really don't want to come to work. Seriously don't bother. Restaurant felt dirty and definitely lack luster. Weird sewer smell and dusty everywhere. Children's drawings crumpled on floor. Food was ok at best and service was pretty bad. Highly overpriced for what you get. Unfortunate because it used to be pretty good. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Count me in the \"not impressed\" crowd.

Sure, talk about the portion sizes all you want, but our $26.95 per person (before tax/tip) banquet-style dinner ended up being a bunch of bread with oil/vinegar (yay, all you can eat bread?), some salad, a couple scoops of baked rigatoni, one or two pieces of chicken (mainly tasted of cheese though) cannelloni, a couple pieces of eggplant parmesan, and a small dessert.

I will say that the cannelloni was really delicious, the eggplant parmesan was about as good as you'd expect, and the cheesecake was also really good and different from typical store-bought cheesecake, possibly due to a different cheese being used. Regardless, I can think of many better ways (or one other particular way) to spend that dollar amount for dinner."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this restaurant. Everything we ordered tasted fantastic. The chicken Parmesan was fantastic and the tiramisu was awesome. It's is a great place to go with a large crowd."}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's Day so I knew what I was getting in to. Called around noon hoping to make a reservation. Unfortunately, was told they were not accepting any more reservations. They even went as far to say walk ins were being turned away and not welcomed due to overwhelming demand. I went on Open Table and found I could make a reservation at any time during the day for 15 minute intervals. Booked for 7 pm. 

We were seated at 655 and were instantly told they didn't have high chairs available and my two year old would have to sit in a chair. The stack of four high chairs approximately ten feet away from our table said otherwise. I took one and she had a high chair. 

We sat for 25 minutes and asked for our server to greet us twice before someone finally came over. The server apologized stating our original server had a panic attack and announced she \"just couldn't do it anymore\". The younger guy who waited on us was very nice and through. 

The food was what you would expect. Given the hectic day, it was a positive to be in and out in approximately two hours."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with Dawn as our server for a table of 8. We were seated at the \"kitchen\" table which was pretty cool. Dawn was very attentive and very knowledgeable with the menu offerings.
Food was excellent but the Chicken Marsala was amazing as always."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and John our server was very helpful and helped me understand that the spaghetti was a side to the parmigiana I was ordering as was the salad. As we are waiting for our meals we absorbed all of the fabulous Italiana decor of old vintage Italian photos, they are great!  The warm bread was delicious and he kept it coming!  We also ordered some calamari it was delicious! Our meals were all very good and the lunch portions were just enough!  I would recommend lunch on the weekdays. I have been here before on the weekend or evenings when it is crazy busy. Again John was very nice, personable and our iced teas were never empty!"}
{"text":"To my surprise I saw a sign that said Happy Hour all Day that imports beers $3 and Drinks $5 of course we came into the bar area and sat down.  Order a pizza half cheese and half pepperoni and it was yummy. Service wasn't bad either.  A definite come back on my list of places to eat & drink in Vegas."}
{"text":"It was a great experience! Sharing size were properly set and we enjoyed chicken parmesan and lasagna. Reasonable price and friendly servers. Also after the visit I had to ask them to send me an itemized receipt and they responded quickly."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever seen in this restaurant. They kept us waiting for 20 mins without even asking us for drinks and the restaurant was completely empty! Then the server (the worst server I've ever seen) comes and says \"I have 3 tables before you so if you want to wait\" In other words you better leave is what he tried to sah right? I call the manager and he backs the server up saying he is not like that WOW this is definitely not the service that a restaurant at the MGM corporation should have. This happened today October 9th at 3 pm. I hope somebody takes care of these people who don't have any idea what customer service is"}
{"text":"When it comes to a family or group dinner bucca is a great place to go. They have a nice variety of italian style meals, as well as wine. The ambience can be either dressy or casual, what ever suits your occasion. Some of the food could use a pinch of salt, but hey, thats what they keep the shakers there for. At this location service was great, however, i wish our waitress had been on top of our drinks. I dont particularly blame her, as she was extremely busy taking care of other tables as well, but i noticed a lot of other waiters standing around when they could have taken a few tables them selves. None the less, great food and a great time."}
{"text":"I had not been here in a while and what a dissapointment. Ordered the pasta diabla (the spicy one) as the last time i was there, but this time the only flavor it had was red pepper flakes. Im used to eating spicy and very spicy food but when all you can taste in a mountain of over priced pasta is red pepper flakes until your mouth is numb is ridiculous. I did not notice it in the beginning because of the sauce. I told the server and a concerned manager came out saying something about they had other complaints and that they were training new cooks. Instead of comping the dish they brought me a doggy bag of the same crap ( probably without red pepper flakes) but who knows cause it went into the trash as soon as i left. Omg the heart burn and gastric issues ive been having. To be fair service was ok. Btw for the same $50 average per person you can eat a block away at a delicious place ( the mission), if you can find a table. Bucca is going down in flames and very fast."}
{"text":"I used to work here and served table. Now I'm enjoying myself having a dinner at Buca. Linguine frutti de mar still the best and my fav dish so far."}
{"text":"I just used Buca's catering service for a party in my home and it could not have been easier.  The food was hot, fresh and delicious and the delivery person (Sara, who was so nice) set everything up on my kitchen counter in under 10 minutes.  Money well spent and it could not have been easier - having Buca cover the catering allowed me to enjoy my guests!  They bring the plates, bread, butter, utensils...everything.  I have already booked them again for Christmas Eve delivery."}
{"text":"I love a good Marsala wine reduction and therefore hated the one I got at Buca's. Tasted like a honey glaze and was disgusting."}
{"text":"My family and I used to really enjoy going to Buca di Beppo, both dining in and getting takeout. However, today I ordered curbside take out and was very disappointed. I phoned in an order for Apple Gorgonzola Salad (large), two bowls of soup, small garlic bread Florentine and Tiramisu. I originally just wanted regular garlic bread, but the chic who took my order over the phone talked up the Florentine, so I ordered that instead. She also didn't have a menu handy when I asked about the prices. But, I had a $10 off coupon, so I wasn't too concerned. Well - I should have been. The bill came to $55 - $45 after the coupon. I waited for about 15 minutes in the parking lot for my order, with my kids squirming in the car, though I had arrived 25 minutes after placing my order - which was the amount of time I was told it would take to be ready. Upon arriving at my Grandmother's house for lunch, I was shocked to find that this 'great' Florentine bread that costs $14 only serves 4 people. I'm not talking 4 big portions either. It was just regular old bread with some garlic butter, a bunch of cheese melted on top and some spinach mixed in there. There may have been a small amount of sauce under the cheese. The soup was enough for one person ($6 a bowl? Really?), was ice cold, and absolutely NOT spectacular. It was a plain old, standard vegetable soup in a tomato base with two or three smidges of ground beef. The salad was sizable and worth the $10 - but the signature Italian vinaigrette dressing didn't taste right with it. The Tiramisu was a good sized portion, delicious, and worth the $11 they charge for it. So, I called with my complaints about the bread. The girl on the other end of the phone gave me some crap about how the sauce on the bread was some special blend, and how it was only $2 more than the bread I had planned to order. Thing is, the bread I planned to order was a LARGE order, and the Florentine was $3 more for the SMALL, not $2 more. Besides that, it was just a big rip off. I can make a loaf of bread twice that size myself, that is better than that, with my own secret sauce for under a dollar. And next time, I will."}
{"text":"Writing this review only because I care about Buca and this last visit (Yesterday 03.29.2015) was awful. 

The Good:

1- I made a reservation on open table and we got in 15 minutes early yet we got seated right away.
2- Were greeted by a hostess and she was very welcoming
3- The food as always is good
4- Our server Paulo was good as he was doing EVERYTHING, literally, everything and see the BAD section for more details.

The Bad:

1- Service was VERY SLOW, and that is not because Paulo, it is because Paulo was doing EVERYTHING. From clearing tables, then cleaning them, getting the food out, checking on everyone to make sure they have everything. 
2- Service was very slow
3- Service was very slow 

The management at this restaurant seems that they did not care yesterday. As there were no buss staff, clearing  tables or food runners to get t he food out. They did not care to at least pick up the pace and come over an ask at least how things were, knowing that the section the server was serving at is short staffed. I felt so bad for the server, that i really wanted to get up and do something. 

A party of 5 or 6 showed up after us an the hostess brought them to the same section we were seated, and Paulo the server was making sure we were taken care of but at the same time he asked that group to wait for a few minutes while he cleaned the table they were being seated at. The Hostess did not even bother to help clear the table. Overall it was bad and we have been to too many different Buca locations and this is the first time i see such a mess. 

So Paulo gets 5 stars, the restaurant however gets 3 or less."}
{"text":"If I could give a -0 I would. Came here for dinner, waitress came 2x!!! To take our order and deliver the food. No refills. We had to ask for the tab. $90 NOT WORTH IT. Food was gross and bland. We typically are very good tippers and base our amount on the service, she got next to nothing. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"This was the 3rd time I had eaten Bucca and had a horrible experience. As a former employee of Robert Earl, I know this is not how he wants his restaurants ran. I know this is a franchise but they still have to uphold the standards of Bucca brand. I have written this place off for you."}
{"text":"I had High hopes this place would have some good food. I have been here all week and really haven't had anything good most of the restaurants were mediocre at best. The Caesar salad was absolutely the best I have ever had don't know what they do but they need to keep doing. I ordered chicken Parmesan, figured hey this is an Italian place in must be good. Unfortunately it was probably the blandest chicken that I have ever had in my life. No flavor, marinara sauce was mediocre. Service was OK, but the food was not worth going back for again."}
{"text":"Booked on Open Table, right after I got the confirming email I called the restaurant and asked if the kitchen table was available. I happen to enjoy sitting in the kitchen. So I was disappointed that my wife and my daughter weren't fans of the experience. But Buca was awesome - they swapped us right out into another table immediately without a wait. Woot!

We chose the large tossed salad to start and then three big entrees to share. Yep, that was probably too much food. Huge platter of Eggplant Parmesan. Big tray of cheese manicotti. Ginormous vat of shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. All really delicious, all really big servings. We took a shedload of it home with us.

As for the desserts, they are ALSO sized to share. The brownie sundae, by itself, is enough for five people. And we also had what we thought was going to be ONE canoli but was actually three of 'em. Oy, my tummy hurts."}
{"text":"Great place, fantastic food.. I'm a huge fan of Italian. The hostess was very nice, as was our waiter. The only downfall was that we had a reservation and still waited another 20 minutes before we sat down at the table. The food takes a little time to be brought out, but it is delicious. I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Wayyyyyyyy over priced!!!!! Family friendly environmental with a decent service. The food is a 3/5 over all but the price is just not matched the food. I understand the concept of family serving due to the huge portion but once again, not worth the money."}
{"text":"Dined here a couple of nights ago and had an okay experience. Not bad but nothing that will stand out in my mind. The service was great and our waiter was very good about coming back to check on us even though there was a huge party on the other side of the restaurant that he was also assisting. Good service.

The food was okay. We got the Quattro Forno dish which is four different kinds of stuffed shells including manicotti, ravioli, shells and canolli. The food was cooked well and it had good flavor but it was not anything that I would go out of my way to have again. We also got a small order of cheesy garlic bread which could have stood to be cooked a little longer. It tasted good but got cold really fast and no one likes cold bread.

I do not recommend coming here with just two people. The family style dishes are huge even if you just get one small order between two people. They probably gave us 20 large pieces of garlic bread which we definitely could not finish and garlic bread does not reheat well so I felt like I was just wasting it. I would recommend coming here with a party of four or more.

Not sure if I will be back. Maybe if I have a large party and we need a lot of food for a certain occasion."}
{"text":"I love This restaurant in San Diego but Las Vegas location is a huge disappointment I perfectly understand they're busy, food was good but to me, customers service makes the difference and unfortunately here servers were a little bit rude... In a hurry! I guess it was my bad luck!!! Spaguetti with meat balls too dry, sangría was great..."}
{"text":"Great location and had take out for the Superbowl with a short 15 minute walk to the Aria----great party platters and over fed 8 people with left overs....great Vegas option with groups"}
{"text":"Sorry to say last night's  dinner was not very good. Disappointed they were not busy, dinners came to table lukewarm, had to remind waitress about coffee received our dinner the same time another table received theirs and they were seated 15 to 20 minutes  after we placed our order"}
{"text":"I sent this email  to our reception coordinator on 4/12 and never heard back. I will share it with the Yelp community, and hopefully save someone from having a crappy wedding reception there.

\"I just wanted to write to you about our experience at Buca for our wedding reception. My husband and I were running late to the reception and I got a frantic call from my Maid of Honor telling me that Buca swears that no wedding cake was delivered. I had to get in touch with the bakery, who called the driver who insisted that it was delivered at 9AM and he even gave me the name of the person who accepted the cake. We had to insist that Buca check the freezer for the cake. Finally, they did find it.

Our reception was supposed to start at 1PM. We arrived at 1:30, but my guests were there at 1. Our party wasn't even served salad until 2. Once the entrees came, they were barely even warm. We specifically asked for a vegan salad and entree, which is on the banquet contract, and the server had no clue what we were talking about. My maid of honor had to wait for them to make it, and be served well after everyone else.

The server barely came by. We had to hunt him down to ask for things and ended up having to flag down a different server a few times. We had 3 people that didn't show up, so we had extra food. The server didn't even offer to box it up for us, he just threw away extras that we paid for without even asking. No one offered to help with the cake or even offered us any extra plates to serve it on. We found some plates on a shelf, and had to get them ourselves. We probably would have had better service had we just walked in and been seated at a regular table.

I planned my reception at Buca because my friend had her reception there a few years ago and highly recommended it. She told me how great the service was and how helpful the staff was. This was only my 2nd time ever eating at Buca, and I was greatly disappointed with the entire reception. I just thought I would give you some feedback on how our reception went. \"

Our wedding banquet was about $600. I wish we had spent the money elsewhere. The fact that Buca was right there to make the contract and collect the money, but then ignored my email says a lot about how they do business. Please don't let them ruin your banquet too."}
{"text":"I know it's a restaurant targeted at large parties, so I'd imagine they'd hire waitstaff that know how to handle larger parties (or at least train 'em to).

Our waitress consistently forgot about portions of our order, like a water for one of our 8 people (though everyone else had a water at that point). The kitchen staff actually brought the limes she requested out before the water arrived, probably 10 minutes after our drink order. The second pitcher of beer we ordered after appetizers didn't arrive until after we were finished with the dinner portion. I could go on, but you get the point.

Service was really slow, and it was hot and musty in our section. For a party of 8, 2 hours on a Sunday evening is pretty rough. The kitchen wasn't behind, we just sat with empty plates for a good 30-45 minutes after our meal.

Good food ruined by the lack of service. Too bad."}
{"text":"I actually wrote a review about the Arrowhead location a couple weeks back, and was contacted by management. They offered to make it right and sent me a gift card to come back. My final tab was like $1.02.

With that being said, I had a MUCH better experience here. We tend to joke around with waitstaff a lot, and it's usually a good judge of how the service will be. At Arrowhead, our server was in such a \"hurry\" that she didn't bother to converse with us. Courtney at this Mesa location was very involved with the three tables in our section and definitely rolled with the punches. She even brought the birthday candle/song over for my wife (as our meal at Arrowhead was initially for her bday).

I left happy and full. Carbonara and the mini meatballs were solid. Much better than my last visit!"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer we came here on Christmas night for my birthday. 

Cons: 
-Reservation was for 7 and we waited until 730 for dinner 
-The kitchen was backed up an hour (our food took an hour and a half) 
-Our coffee took an hour to get to the table because our server forgot 
-We had no silverware by the time our salad came
-We had no plates (when we got them we were one short) 
-23$ for chicken parm which is literally 3 chicken breasts, with no pasta. So I ate a chicken breast by itself for my entree. 
-chicken parm had to be remade twice (my entire family finished eating before I got my food)
-our server grabbed the check without asking if we would like dessert (knowing it was my birthday)
-the entire dinner took about 4 hours 

Pros
-the manager came over an apologized for the chicken parm &said he would comp it off our bill (received the check at the end of the night and it was still on there)


Will not be returning. I do thank all the staff that worked on Christmas Day but that was a horrendous experience."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in over a year and it was time to return and see if there was any changes. First, the decor is still cool...lots of pictures, statues, albums on the wall. We were greeted by everybody working there ---very nice. Ordered the apple Gorgonzola salad. It came out wrong and had to be reordered. This is a really wonderful salad....Unfortuately it took 15 Min's to get it the second time. Their bread used to be wonderful too.....hot and fresh full of flavor now it's just plain old french bread tasteless. 
Our entree of lasagna came out on a very hot plate but was cold but burnt on the bottom. Manager came to the rescue and immediately took care of the problem. I liked the idea of having the chef bring out the correct entree since it was his fault and not the waiter. 
Would I go back? Probably not, too many good Italian restaurants in the area that are better"}
{"text":"They get two star because the food was good. Else I would have given zero stars. Our server was not polite at all. He took the order wrong and brought us wrong dish size.
When we informed him, he took away the half dish saying they can adjust if they take half the dish back. So low on courtesy. Are they going to serve it to someone else I wonder.
At the time of ordering we had given him a coupon which being hotel guest we had got at check in. He took it but didn't apply it while billing. When we told him to check, he said give the coupon now. We said we gave it to you while ordering. He said really!! Then he went away. He brought the corrected bill then he rudely asked for our ID and said they want to confirm we are staying here.
It's ok we understand but then he started talking deliberately to adjacent customers while my husband was handing over the ID. Very rude... I felt so annoyed.
We gave tip as it's courtesy on our part but the hospitality is horrible rather absent.
I would say go for good food, don't expect good behavior."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for family outings. We enjoy the food and atmosphere. Today, like many other occasions, we came to Buca to celebrate. This time was quite aweful, I regretfully have to say. We arrived at 730 pm to celebrate my brothers bday and the server we had was discourteous the entire night. Now, I had a job working with customers and sometimes, like most of us, he could just had a bad day. Well this is not the case. Our server \"TRE\" was our server previously and had the same ill-mannered attitude like before. Not only did he make us feel unwelcomed, he did not even check on us to see if we needed silverware, napkins, more drinks, or ask how we were doing. We were never once greeted with a smile and he always made us feel as if we were a bother. Furthermore, we did not recieve our main entree until 905pm (our appetizers took a while as well). I am aware it was saturday and we had expected it to be busy, but the entire time we waited I had spotted him talking with co-workers. I also did not like how he talked to us as if we were idiots. I guess the sarcasm was a little over the top. We love this place, but these incidents might have us reconsidering a new dine-in spot, especially if we are going to be treated poorly."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location because we were given a gift card. It was Sunday, New Years Eve at 11:00am. We were seated quickly by the hostess and given the lunch menu. We did mention this was our first visit to our server. Many items sounded great and were reasonably priced. We made our selections and placed our orders with our server. She gave us our beverages as my husband stepped away to use the restroom. 

A few minutes later the hostess returned asking if we placed our order and I said yes. She asked who took it and told her who took our order. Our server returned to inform me the lunch menu is not available and we had to choose something off the regular menu which is family style portions that we would share. She apologized explaining neither her or the hostess work on Sundays.  

When my husband returned from the restroom, I let him know what happened and we would have to choose something else from the regular menu. We decided we would just go since that is not what we wanted and the prices were hugely different. 

To top things off - after we informed our server of this, we were still charged for our sodas. Since the error was not our fault, you would think that they would have honored our order that was already taken. This was poorly handled and since this was our first visit here ever, we would have hoped the staff would have done their best to ensure we would want to return like simply not charging us for sodas that were $7.00! We definitely won't be returning here regardless if we have a gift card."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 other people and we ordered 3 items because we couldn't decide and everything looked delicious. When the food came we were overwhelmed. The server did tell us that it was family style with huge portions but we figured we would take the rest home. Glad we did! We got the lasagna, the spaghetti with meatballs and the spicy chicken rigatoni. All were so good! I especially liked the rigatoni. It had a nice kick and even though I don't like peas the sauce was so good I didn't even taste them.  I finished about half the bowl and took the rest home and it was still really good the next day. Can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"I don't like to go to chain restaurants, but Buca is in a class by itself!  It is a fun place, staff is efficient and friendly, and all (or most) of the food is great, for the money, which I think is reasonable. I usually go with my sister and her husband. We get the green salad, the chicken limone or chicken saltimbocca, plus the spaghetti with meat sauce, all great (the limone not quite as good as the saltimbocca).  All the small size which serves 2-3. It's plenty of food for all of us and we sometimes take some leftovers home. I don't like the spaghetti marinara as well as the meat sauce, not the same flavor. If you want a fun atmosphere, homey, comfortable feeling, this place is great, whether for a romantic dinner for two, or a get-together of 10 in one of the private alcoves."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get Italian food! AND everyone that works there is soooo nice! I love this place, every time I go I end up happy and full."}
{"text":"Meh. Its average (at best) Italian food. 

We went here last week for a dinner with the hubs company. 

We were in a small semiprivate room and there were maybe 15 people in our group. Our waiter was pretty bad, acted like he didn't want to be there, and at one point when someone FINALLY got his attention after attempting to flag him down twice to ask for a drink refill he actually snarled his lip a bit! 

The food. Some was really good, some was really bad. I had the Caesar salad, it was salad, its hard to mess up. I also had a piece of the plain bread...its really \"doughy\". For the main course there was the chicken Marsala which was very sweet, almost to sweet. The baked zitti tasted pretty spot on and was the best of the three. Lastly there was the fettuccine Alfredo, holy blob of white tasteless pasta. I salt and peppered and added more grated parm to it and it still lacked flavor, it was beyond gross. 

For dessert there was cheese cake and chocolate cake. The cheese cake had no crust but was decent. The chocolate cake was pretty moist and good. 

Will I go back here again? Only if invited by someone else and they are paying, no way would I put my own money towards this place."}
{"text":"The best calamari we had, the service was superb. Great experience in the restaurant
Will definitely cone back in this location."}
{"text":"I am from out of town but frequent this restaurant during my son's hockey games. We have always been satisfied but this visit was impeccable. All restaurants can have a slight hiccup here and there, it's how they go about fixing it that leaves a lasting impression. My son's spaghetti was fairly cold. Not only did they come out with a piping hot replacement, but they boxed up the original spaghetti to have later. This was after they treated us with a free appetizer (prior to our meal, just because) and clinched it with a free dessert. Honestly, we would have been happy with them reheating the meal, but instead they went beyond what was expected. Their manager, Dustin, was amazing and manages an equally great team!! Thanks for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of 11 last night. The food wasn't anything special, but it wasn't awful either. Everything is served family style. I shared a small Penne San Remo with one other person, and it was a good amount of food. Servers were very friendly but service was slow. For a shared entree and two soft drinks it was only $25, so it's definitely affordable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...makes you forget your in vegas.. Best anti pasti salad... Service can be a bit slow at times"}
{"text":"I ordered the veal saltimbocca.  The portion that arrived was not what I would consider to be a family portion.  We paid extra for a side of pasta.  Seems wrong.  Same for the fried calamari appetizer.  If you want a quite place to eat this may not be your spot.  We had to move our table because the party next to us was very loud.  The food was good.  Order a pasta dish if you want quantity,  Drinks were also on the higher end.  $7.50 for a Peroni on draft.   We ordered a second round of drinks that never came.  $50 for a party of two.  We expected we would be bringing part of our meal home.  That did not happen since the portions were not what we were told they would be,"}
{"text":"This place had happy hour specials all day long while we stayed at the Luxor. $3 beers and $5 mixed drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Normally I would steer clear of chain restaurants like this while on vacation. I can visit Buca di Beppo at home, why would I go to one in another city when there are so many other choices right? After a long road trip and getting in very late we didnt feel like venturing out however. Service was great, waiter was very friendly. Food was great as well! A little on the pricy side, but they serve family portions which is why. Don't be fooled by the \"small\", its still A LOT of food"}
{"text":"I thought that this was a wonderful value! We sat at the bar and were served immediately.  We shared a pasta off the make your own pasta menu and it was more food than we could have ever dreamed of eating in one sitting.  Our waiter was friendly, the ambiance was fun, and the drinks at the bar were some of the least expensive I have seen on the strip! A super solid experience all around."}
{"text":"I had lunch and ordered too much food. :) Take home containers and Bags are well prepared by the extremely pleasant staff. Deborah politely seated me in a perfect spot and Sarah provided a very pleasurable experience with recommendations and timely service. I have had the brichetta here twice. Savory juices compliment a tremendous portion of toasted garlic bread topped with deluctable toppings, truly fantastic. The Alfredo Fettuccini was served hot and was delicious as well. This location has a walk through kitchen with a table for two, for that special engagement.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit hidden but they get my 4 stars because the waiters are very people friendly and make you feel right at home . I just wish that the hotel would give them an easier way to get there ."}
{"text":"One star because this place legitimately sucks. I waited 20 min to be seated, then another 20 just to get drink order taken. Drinks came about 10 min after. Flagged down passing busser to send someone for food order and the bartender comes to take it... I was seated in a booth with no other tables in the section. Okey dokey. Food took literally 45 min to arrive. I was fuming & took everything to go. I hate this place. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I was so starving when I got here.  Had antipasto salad and spicy chicken rigatoni. Wow. When I ordered the guy said that's a lot of food for one person!  I said you'd shut up if ya knew what's good fee ya!  And bring me more bread!  Haha after 2 days of nothing but beer..."}
{"text":"We came here for a family dinner and it was my first time. It was easy to make a reservation and we were guided through the kitchen to our table, interesting restaurant setup. It was amusing to see a booth in the middle of the kitchen with folks dining. It's family-style ordering, so we went with the mozzarella garlic bread to start and the apple Gorgonzola salad for the table. The salad was great, loaded with Granny Smith apples, walnuts, goat cheese, cranberries and greens. We definitely finished the large size (serves 5, we were 7).

For our main entrees, we ordered the chicken saltimbocca, shrimp fra diavolo, and the spicy chicken rigatoni. The first one had a strange texture, a bit wet from the sauce, but I liked the capers. The second two dishes used red pepper to add spice and they were good. I'm not a big fan of pasta in general but the portions were generous and we even had some to take home. Service was prompt and the environment was loud but joyful, with several birthdays and prom celebrations. The deserts looked tasty but we were too stuffed from the food, maybe next time."}
{"text":"We had kids with us and I love how they took us through the kitchen to our table. The kids got a kick out of it. Food was delicious and plentiful!! If you go for dinner, it is served family style, which means everyone pretty much has to agree! It also means it can get pretty expensive pretty fast. I would still go back!!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh I love Buca Birthday song!
I came here to celebrate my birthday and the song is the best!!
I should record it when everybody sang the song."}
{"text":"Ordered a variety of items from this restaurant's catering menu for a work colleague's farewell lunch. 

From the appetizers selection we got x2 servings of Buca Trio Platter (fried calamari, fried mozzarella and stuffed mushrooms, served with sauces), I thought the stuffed mushrooms was the best. The Mozzarella tasted stale, and I couldn't finish it and for the fried calamari, I thought it was too tough and oily.

Our mains were Penne alla Vodka & Baked Rigatoni with meat sauce. While I liked the Penne alla Vodka, I've had better. I liked that the baked rigatoni was topped with different kind of cheeses, and the ricotta especially added some freshness.

For desserts, we got the Dolce Platter (Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate Cake, Homemade Cheesecake and Italian Crème Cake) and Chocolate Chip Cannoli. The only one i liked from these 5 was the Italian Creme cake - it was really fresh and lemony. The cannoli was the one I liked least - too oily and weird chocolate taste. Tiramisu, the chocolate cake and the cheesecake were all just meh. The food was functional and served it's purpose but for me, there was no wow or oomph factor, hence the 3 stars (it was a-okay).

Note: #324 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016"}
{"text":"Okay the food was not good at all to much money I will never come back there are so many other Restaurant to eat Italian food better an less money I can cook better an charge less money ..  The ads on line are false the pictures are nothing what you get . they show a round pizza an they give you a square what up with that .. the calamari was bad a not enough foe 15.99 an there large cheese pizza was 22.99 for just cheese.. Stay far a way for this place . I will never go back an I will let my friends know as well.."}
{"text":"Came here several times! I gave 5 stars, because staff are very courteous, real Italian food lol, and the price seems a bit high, but you pay for what you get! I'll always return here!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I went for dinner. After waiting 45 minutes when they said it was a 20 minute wait, we were finally seated. We received cold, icy bread and dipping. After asking for warm bread, we were finally given it when our main entree arrived. So we ordered the chicken parmesan.  What we got was veal! After speaking to our waiting and explaining that we received the wrong meal, he sent it back, but then our bread and spaghetti were cold! Never ending nightmare and it was not the slightest but busy! It was 9:30! Never again! Sorry, I'll go to the Bucca off the strip! Much better!"}
{"text":"pricey, family style, feels like you're in an italian granny theme park, the lack of individual meals and the seating is not very great either....don't know what people see in it."}
{"text":"I have been here probably half a dozen times in the past and I remember liking it. I chose this place for a special day since it was on OpenTable and I was looking for reservations which was nice and convenient on a \"holiday\". However, after Mother's Day I'm never coming here again. 

First off everything is family size now so you cannot order a meal for yourself. You must share with someone else or with many other people. Horrible business model but I'm sure they love it since for just four people it cost over $80 bucks. What a ripoff for an app, chicken and a bowl of pasta. A tiny tray of calamari was $14 and it wasn't as good as other places. Also they had ran out of basil which was a bummer.

Next, the service was severely lacking. our server was extremely inattentive, would ignore requests when we tried to get his attention. He would look at us, wave and go in the other direction. He constantly forgot to bring us drink/water refills, food/bread/sides, seasoning, etc.. after we had kindly asked. We had empty glasses for over 15 minutes. 

The worst part though was when the kitchen undercooked the chicken limone. By the time they recooked it, I had already finished my meal and my mom had lost her appetite. Great way to ruin mother's day dinner! there are dozens of better places in old town and Scottsdale in general. Going to avoid this place from now on."}
{"text":"Came back, and I'd write the exact same review all over again.

Now pass me the potato gnocchi, please. And as for Tony P's issue, sorry Tony - but go marry yourself that British chic and bring her back here for some good Gnocchi and Chianti! I'll buy if you do!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, service was great!  We went with Caesar salad which had a little too much dressing but still good flavor.  For dinner we did spaghetti with meatballs and the cheesy garlic bread.  Bread was really good.  The spaghetti had good flavor, but too much sauce which also really oily.  This actually had more garlic than our bread if that's even possible.  We left tasting so much garlic!  Good place for mediocre Italian food - if you want something more high end or authentic I suggest elsewhere.  I will say our waitress was very attentive and checked on us regularly."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, I've heard great thing about it so we decided to finally try it. I don't thin I'm coming back, the service was good, but the food wasn't that great, I was expecting something way better for their prices. We orderer fried calamari, they were really good, you could actually taste the fresh calamari; we also ordered baked ziti, which was very dry and served lukewarm, and unseasoned. The Bianca pizza, wasn't good, wasn't uneatable; the cappuccinos were mediocre. Overall it was mediocre food, nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I used to love coming to Bucca and enjoyed their food. Now I find it not very tasty and severely overpriced. Veal marsala was overcooked. Linguine Frutti di Mare wasn't what it used to be. Pasta is again overcooked and flavor was bleh. Maybe my taste buds have outgrown this place now that I recognize quality food. NO MORE."}
{"text":"I guess being from the NY Metro area, I was searching for something similar. We went here Sunday evening, place was busy. Service was fine, but my issue is paying $20 for spaghetti and meatballs and not getting a sald? I mean, come on....the pasta was box-like, nothing special, sauce your basic marinara. I just expected more as I was told this is the BEST spaghetti in AZ. If so, stick to the AZ fast food circuit and use your savings for a trip to NY/NJ where pizzerias serve the same thing for $7.95. With a sald. And hot garlic bread. real bread. I won't even go there. I guess when peopl e are in Scottsdale-Spend mode, they don't care about adding $10 for a side sald.  Food was okay, My search for the best spaghetti and meatballs goes on. As far as the rest of the meal, all good, all overpriced, none NYC quality."}
{"text":"We went as a party of 9 (with a reservation) for my boyfriends 23rd birthday on a Tuesday at 5:30 PM. Jarrett was our server and took great care of us! Prompt on refills, helpful with the menu, and super friendly. When we go back we will request him as our server! He is the reason for the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my brothers engagement.  The place was very busy, but the servers were still very attentive and friendly even with all the chaos going on.  The decor of this place is really cool.  I always like dim lit places.

There were about 25 of us, but they were very accommodating.  The food was very good.  For a franchise place they had some good stuff.  What really stood out was the chicken saltimbocca it was probably the biggest hit at the table.  I will be back for that dish.  The whole night was great they really did a great job with everything."}
{"text":"seated in a dirty booth, sat in someone else's crumbs for my over priced, over cooked shrimp Florentine. Server was nice but unable to really give quality service. kinda bummed, had high hopes. Raspberry tea was good, bread too.."}
{"text":"I was here a few months ago and it was such a horrible experience with the wait time and our orders being incorrect. Especially my margarita. Now I remember why I didn't come back for years."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, a few years ago, it was a Christmas Dinner for a Starbucks staff party- I was my best friend's plus one.  Everything was served family style on huge platters. There were appetizers and entrees- I don't remember what we had but I know that everyone didn't leave hungry. It was pretty neat. The decor was very gawdy- the walls were covered with framed prints against a deep burgundy-red wall. It's kinda dark at night. 

I'd been wanting to try this place for a while- we have a bunch of Entertainment Book coupons for $10 off a $20 purchase. We went for  lunch this past saturday, which wasn't busy, there were three other parties besides us. You get fresh bread and olive oil with balsamic vinegar. My husband ordered the lasagna and I ordered the chicken parmigiana (came with spaghetti marinara)- we got the lunch entrees @ $9.99 each. It took a little while but the server explained that there was a big luncheon (in another room) and she apologized for the delay- but it wasn't a big deal. My husband didn't finish his dish. I didn't finish mine either. It was pretty good. I like that the chicken is pounded thin. Our server was pretty good about refilling the drinks and getting us more bread. The bill was $10.80 (coupon). My husband wants to suggest this one to his dad (who's Italian). There are only two locations in Las Vegas (restaurant row- this one & Summerlin). I'm sure it's busier at night, so you might want to make reservations."}
{"text":"Hubby didn't like the food very much the last time we had food from the original location at Restaurant Row (due to the marinara sauce changing, much sweeter).

But it was a different story here, for yesterday's lunch visit. We both had sandwiches- mona panini & smash meatball burger (split it- always been our thing) and our son had a kid's meal (for 10 and younger) @ $4.99, pepperoni pizza- it was huge! Six choices, the others were: mac & cheese, spaghetti w/ meatball, fettucine alfredo, cheese pizza, and chicken parmigiana. Total was $25.41. 

I had a gift card to use. We also checked the menu online. I called to make sure that they were open so I called and got a live person. Yes, we did our homework. (On a past holiday we found out the hard way that the restaurant was closed.)

Jessica was our server. She was quick, attentive and very nice. She checked in on us numerous times. And she asked us frequently if we were good or if we needed anything else. She also offered to sign up my husband because it seemed like he was bumped off of the email list. Not many other customers which was a surprise. Not that we were complaining, because our food was prepared pretty quickly. 

We started off with yummy bread with the oil, balsamic vinegar & herb combo. I had to stop myself or else I wouldn't be hungry for my lunch. The mona panini was delish. All of the flavors really worked together. And the bun was a good size, not too much bread, just enough.  The meatball sandwich was really good too. I liked them both but maybe the panini edged out the meatball sandwich just a smidge. The garlic fries were perfect, crisp, with just enough seasoning. Not greasy or mushy, I don't like that. 

You can say that this visit renewed our interest in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Regret having our Family Holiday Dinner here. The Service was great, but the food - bland and less than even average - we had Spaghetti & meatballs, a big bowl of pasta with some chunks of tomatoes on it and ok meatballs. Chicken Marsala was laced with a lot of sugar - yuk!  Desserts were awesome, reason for a 2nd star. We will not choose this place again -- spent way too much money for a not even mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Update: Dinner for 5 on 5/22/16. 
I promised the regional manager I'd update my review if I ever came back.  This is it. 

Went back to use our dinner comp coupon, and had a less frustrating experience, but really not enough to change the 2 star rating.  Actually I'd go for 2.5 stars, but it's not a YELP option. 

Buca has half of the dining equation right - good food. But the service side of the scale is nearly empty.  

We were please to see that the parking lot was not overflowing - - it would mean a short wait for a table.....

I remember feeling like an intruder. Like we weren't REALLY welcome.  It wasn't like the hostess was growling at us - - - but she certainly wasn't friendly: no welcome, no smile, no \"glad you came\".  Just a perfunctory exchange about the number in our party and our request for a high chair.  It was a little weird - especially since every other service worker in America knows you're supposed to act like you're actually PLEASED that the customer has visited. Heck - the guy behind the counter at 7-11 makes you feel like a friend every time you walk in. 

Our server was obviously new at the job.  Or at least new enough at Buca that they haven't yet had time to either train her or fire her. She was friendly, but timid.  So timid that  no one could hear what she was saying.  Her whisper continued even though she had been asked \"excuse me?\" and \"what did you say?, and \"I can't hear you\" by almost everyone at the  table. 

It was pretty much smooth sailing from there.  Drinks, appetizers, salad, and entrees were delivered timely. At our server's prompting, we ordered the antipasto salad and it was a great pick.  Entrees were delicious and, unlike our previous experience, there was plenty of food.  

It was finally time to leave, but Buca wouldn't hear of it. My credit card disappeared for an uncomfortably long time. We theorized that they didn't know how to process the comp coupon, and perhaps couldn't close the check.  

At any rate, the whole shebang ran $185 (before applying the coupon, but including a tip) for 5 with no alcohol and 2 waters instead of soft drinks. At $37 a head, we'll probably venture elsewhere the next time we're looking to inconvenience a dining room staff."}
{"text":"Not what it once was.  I used to eat at multiple locations and usually enjoyed my meals.  This ones service along with the quality didn't meet the standards of previous visits and each time after it has gotten worse."}
{"text":"As far as Italian restaurants, this place is very average. The service was slow (very friendly though). The pasta was under cooked and the shrimp was small, about the size of a dime. The food wasn't bad, just average. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"After reading some of the previous reviews, I didn't think I need to write anymore, but why not...

The $10 off $20 ticket coupon lured me in. I talked my husband into going there even though the last experience wasn't the best one. So, that said, it was not that good this time either.

First of all, they got rid of personal portion. So we had to choose something we both would eat. Now, my husband and I have very different taste buds. That's why we go to a restaurant!! So I don't have to make 2 different meals for the evening. Also it seems like they have raised the price when they made fancy-new-menu which had more ad by us-air or something that had nothing to do with their food... like Cheese cake factory's menu... (is that just to cover up the fact that they have no variety to choose from...?)

We finally decided and ordered garlic bread and seafood pasta. $9 for garlic bread and $20 for a bowl of pasta... Hmmm why do I get the feeling I'm getting ripped off?

So anyways... food was descent, but I don't like to be forced to get meal for 3 when I just want something for me"}
{"text":"Food was good but tbey put us in a booth that was good for 4 but we were five. It was do tight. Food came out late. Overall experiece was not great. I am a bit disappointed"}
{"text":"We were visiting from California and wanted to take my brothers family to dinner. Awful service!!! We entered lobby no one there... called out \"hello\" after 5 mins. Seated upstairs in an empty restaurant.  We had to ask for bread and she never brought the oil and vinegar,my husband went and found some himself. Took an hour to get our food. Our waitress Marissa kept avoiding us and staying in the other room at a particular table. Besides all this the pastas were not good at all. The chicken limone was the only good thing. Never again will I go to this restaurant!!! Big bill with an even bigger disappointment with service and taste."}
{"text":"Sorry we can't give it a zero. The food was beyond awful.  Went with a group -the chicken Marsala was so sweet that it was inedible, the veal parm was heavily fried & dry and the salmon beyond dry and overdone.  Deserts were a very rubbery tasteless cheesecake and dry dry dry brownie.  Avoid !!! Noise level was very loud and painful because room was small for group.  And the decor of the restaurant was stuck in a time warp and not in a positive nor tasteful way.  Run do not walk away ...."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, but the price for what you get is a rip.  I ordered some chicken with lemon and capers dish and that is all you get:  3 pieces of small chicken breasts in a lemon sauce with some capers = $25.  Granted, the chicken is cooked perfectly, but the sauce is certainly not like the wonderful chicken piccata they used to have (no more piccata there).  Just too expensive to get 3 thin pieces of chicken breasts and NO sides for that amount of money.
My friend got some pasta dish that was also overpriced and, for me, way too spiced with flakes of red chilis which was too hot.  She liked it...but both of us left saying we would never go back because of the ridiculously overpriced meals there.
Now if the chicken dish came with some sides maybe...but just the chicken only for that price:  think not.  
We tipped the nice waiter very well, cause it isn't his fault.
Sorry, Buca, you've gotten too pricey for me for what you serve.  You aren't the Ritz Carlton, and I'm not coming back and either is my friend.

UPDATE:  Ate there again with another.  Again, fantastic service and I mean fantastic!  I didn't like what I ordered, so when a Manager came by and asked I told him (well, I've never been accused of being shy).  He takes the plate and returns with something I had mentioned I loved.  I mean, how can you beat that????
Now the food quality:  Again, excellent!  Had the antipasto salad which was a fresh and crisp and delicious as it could be.  The entrees were cooked perfectly and don't start me on the tiramisu which is beyond great.  
Now for the price which was the main complaint I had before:  Again, there was just two of us, but we went for lunch this time.  The bill came to $60 for 2 entrees, the salad, the huge tiramisu and one lemonade--BUT for all we had--and we brought home probably more than half of it, so now we have a whole nother dinner--the food is definitely priced right now AND everything was fresh!  FRESH!  And authentically cooked (having spent some time in Italy I feel I have some idea).

Where you could really make out with their food and pricing is if you have a party of 4 or more--and if you have 10 people in your party you could super makeout here.  If nothing else, you always know the quality of the food and the service is just superior."}
{"text":"Family style dining not really my thing. What they lack in quality they make up for in quantity, also not my style. We got a dish to share that was supposedly a restaurant favorite, it was very bland. Service was okay, overall disappointing."}
{"text":"So the bf suggested we go here for dinner, and I was like \"hells yea!\" bc I had a coupon! This is the 1st and def last time we will be eating here!

We walked in and the first thing I noticed were the plastic flower outside of the place. SUPER CLASSY!!! LOL. We go inside and got seated quickly, I was dying of thirst from The Secret Garden visit we just had and was looking for our waiter to no avail. We were looking at the menus and another party got seated behind us, 3 minutes later a waiter takes their drink order, brings it back, and asks if they were ready to order! WTF! 

We finally get graced with the presence of the same waiter and he finally takes our drink order, and asks if we would like an appetizer. My bf thinks hes money bags McDuck and orders the garlic parm french bread. I sit there in price shock, I couldnt believe how pricey the food is!! Esp since they had deco of plastic/silk flowers! I'm sitting here thinking to myself, \"I havea 10$off coupon with the purchase of 20$, one freakin plate costs 20$!\" 

Our drinks and app (which were cold!) finally come and I chug down my water, I then go on to ask him about the \"Italian soda/creme sodas\" and if he had ever had one? His answer was \"Yes, but have I told you my suggestions for dinner?\" WTF! I wanted your opinion on creme sodas, not what YOU like for dinner here!!! I then asked for an iced tea and he went away. The meals here are typical italian fare. Spaghetti and meatballs (huge ones) rigatoni, baked ziti, and all that pasta. Then they have chicken and some fish, which was meh on the selection. The bf ordered a small spaghetti and meatballs and a small margherita pizza, I ordered the stuffed small prosciutto chicken breasts. 

His pizza comes out and which looks yummy and we all get a piece... meh. I pile on the parm and it makes it a little better but still meh. The rest of the food comes out and I was like OMFG! Not at the food, but from the utensils that came with my chicken... a fricken bbq grill fork! My 5 year old was like \"WOW!\" I right away took that away, my son woulda had a field day! I look at my bfs spaghetti and was not impressed, pasta was al dente & tasteless and the balls were ok but nothing to fall in love with. I've had WAYYYYY yummier balls in my mouth before; I'm like a ball connoisseur I guess : )

My chicken breasts looked ok, seemed like they were sitting under the heat lamp for a bit. I made myself a plate and cut into the chicken, and took a bite......... I was not satisfied! It tasted & looked like a frozen piece of chicken cordon bleu!  It was bland and tasteless also! UGH! I  also loaded that with parm from the shaker and some salt, it was ok but still dry. FAIL! It also came with some pesto sauce which was ok, but no cigar!

The bill was over 68$ WITH my coupon!! NOT worth the money! Some people may like it because of the large portions, but the quality is terrible! Paying 17$ for spaghetti and 2 balls in insane! And my 23$ frozen cordon bleus were criminal! Horrible!! STAY AWAY! Better yet go to Maggianos and get better quality food (More food & a dessert also!) for about the same!!"}
{"text":"We came here for my husband's birthday with a large group most of which had never been to Bucca before.   We ordered a variety of dishes and they were all good.  Service was a little slow but they did take good care of us."}
{"text":"First time there,we were really excited but left really unhappy,our server was really rude and he took forever to bring me the bread and refill i asked him for,when he brought back our checked with our credit card he barely looked at us and walked away...i dont like to give bad reviews but he really ruined our day..the only good thing was the food and the girl that took a picture of us,we bought the $20 pic and it came out really nice,when we were leaving the two hostess and another girl were talking there and didnt realize we were leaving no one said bye or thank you!"}
{"text":"We had such a lovey experience here at Buca! I had the pasta & salad, fettuccine pasta + mixed green salad. My partner had the spaghetti and meatballs. They were both so delish and perfect plate sizing! As we enjoyed our meal, we had consistent and steady service from our wonderful waitress, Haley. The restaurant is very scenic, with pictures hung on every inch of the walls. My love and I will most definitely be returning soon due to the awesome service and scrumptious food! Thank you Buca for an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Over priced I suggest going to Olive Garden way more affordable!!!!! Don't order the spicy chicken it's like jalopeno with no chicken unless u like really spicy!!!! Only 3 of us and bill was well over 100 bucks close too two hundred they said no happy hour too."}
{"text":"Surprisingly not bad. I don't generally have a very high opinion of Buca di Beppo, but we had a gift card. I went in with pretty low expectations, and I let the people we were bringing there from out of town know this.

We were pleasantly surprised. We got the Baked Ziti and the Pizza, and both were actually good. The ziti was really good, the pizza was meh in consistency but the flavor was very good.

The service started off good, but we stayed until around closing time, and the waitress got some pretty rude attitude towards the end and disappeared to do her closing duties. Other than that it was a surprisingly very nice experience."}
{"text":"Bucca Di Beppo is an Italian chain restaurant specializing in huge portions of mediocre food, with goofy, but likeable decorations thrown around inside.

There is a whole group of diners that believes quantity trumps quality and this chain is custom designed for them. Food is served family style; small orders usually feed 2+ average people and large up to 4. Many people feel you are getting a great value here, but personally I see lots of very CHEAP pasta being served and you are paying through the nose for it.

The pizza's are thin crust and rectangular and did not look very appetizing due to the toppings being slung on it haphazardly and one side was a little burnt, a frozen Frescheta is better than what we were served. The chicken carbonara is nothing like a regular Carbonara, it is served with Alfredo sauce instead the egg thickened cream sauce. 

I can go on and on, a lot of the entrees are pasta, red sauce and cheese, pretty common American Italian fare, nothing exciting. Now was the food inedible or bad - NO, but to be honest The Olive Garden which would get three stars if I ever choose to review it. Quite frankly Olive Garden, has better and more authentic (hard to believe but it's true) food.

Like I said earlier I can see this as a popular place with a certain crowd of diners, it serves it purpose and will continue to be successful, to be absolutely honest, I wanted to like it more than I did. It was a fun atmosphere and I like the concept, but I would much rather pay $14 for an entrée, finish it all and be wowed, than pay $16 for a mediocre pile of food and have mediocre leftovers for the next 2 days."}
{"text":"I had a small wedding reception here this past week with 40 people in attendance. I had been planning this event with the party coordinator, Ashley, for the past 6 months. When I met with her I originally chose a room that could fit 50 people. I wanted something more spacious just in case more than 40 people showed up. When we arrived for the reception we were led to a completely different room that must have only held 40 people considering we all had to squish together. They said they switched rooms because the air conditioning broke in the other one, which I understand that, but they never informed me ahead of time. There just seemed to be a lack of communication all around. The waiters were rude to my guests and didn't even try to do a good job (probably because they knew they would get 18% gratuity no matter what), people were not offered soft drinks or refills when they did have drinks, we sat waiting for the main course for over an hour, there were mix ups with the wine and price of food portions. We supposedly had three waiters dedicated to our party, but you wouldn't have ever known that as they were never really around. The only saving grace of the night was the food was delicious. I would absolutely, 100% NOT recommend this restaurant for private parties. Incredibly horrible service."}
{"text":"Our experience on New Year's Eve was perfect. The gentleman who held the door for us upon entering the restaurant was extremely polite and welcoming. We later found out he was the general manager. He ensured we had a fantastic evening. It is easy to see he cares about his guests and his business, and takes pride in what he does. Both the food and the service kicked off our night the right way. Thank you."}
{"text":"This was such a good Italian place. My friends and I got the Supreme Italian pizza and the Chicken Parmesan. Both were delicious! Their Italian margarita is also tasty. Their prices were reasonable and we didn't have to wait long before being seated. i can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place the portions are family size and prices are reasonable I come here at least once a month. Staff is friendly plus unlimited bread to eat. Great for people who love italian food. The deserts r a little pricey but other than that the food is good."}
{"text":"We have been to Buca several times and generally have had a good experience.  We had the spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna.  It is family dining and the portions are large.  A small spaghetti is enough for two people and the same goes for the appetizers.  Good value. The food is good but nothing to rave about.  It is a place to go with the kids and have a decent meal.  However,  the service was very good. We wanted to change our table and the manager handled it right away.  The waiter checked on us frequently and took care of our requests quickly.  It is advisable to call ahead since it gets crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"We have been to the us chain in other cities but never to the Pittsburgh location 
Went for an early dinner with the family on a Saturday 
Service was just ok 
I know the look they are going for is not exactly classy but the red velvet on the wall as ripped and the my daughter was grossed out by gum she encountered under the table! (I assume I didn't examine it too closely!) not a good impression 
The food however was worth returning for! 
The chicken parm was fantastic and the Calamari was cooked just right! My husband really enjoyed the brussel sprouts also. The spaghetti and meatballs was disappointing! We always order it but this time the meatballs were not as good I think
They must have changed their recipe and not sure if it was due to the spaghetti not being drained properly or the sauce but the bowl was full of water! Had the waitress drain it before she packed it up to take home. Defiantly will skip it in the future! 
Think management needs to get on top of things to get it back to its former glory!!"}
{"text":"We have been to the one in MN several times but this one is huge! Great food, service was a bit rushed but all in all a good place to be. Sign up for their email club before you go!"}
{"text":"Why anyone would eat here is beyond me!
We had a birthday dinner here and the service and food are terrible.
The waiters and waitresses are so slow and don't care.
When we finally got any service we had to ask for bread.
We sat in the pope room and the glass over the pope looked like it had not been cleaned for a long time.
When the food finally came it was terrible.
My daughter and her aunt got the chicken fettuccine and it was dry as a bone. We had to ask for more sauce.
My chicken marsala was not good either.
Also $12.95 for a piece of chocolate cake on some ones birthday is a rip off.
I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"I had driven by this spot many times I did not hear good things... But I was moving out of town and a coworker want to hit it up for lunch so I was like let's do it... I found it strange we were guided through the kitchen to our table... I went with the lunch special Baked Rigatoni - Rich meat sauce and spicy Italian sausage tossed with imported Italian rigatoni and lots of mozzarella. Topped with Parmesan and dollops of ricotta cheese then baked to golden perfection with a Caesar Side salad... I rate the experience as followed.

Baked Rigatoni - C
Caesar Side Salad - B
Staff - B+

The food was nothing to write home about... As I was leaving I still felt weird walking in the kitchen but that could just be me."}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times after events and have always had great service but Friday night we were there about 11 pm or so and we had horrible service for the 1st time, our waitress was very slow and not prompt on refills either we had to go get someone several times for things. Food was okay this time not the best quality as before. Hope it's better next time we go"}
{"text":"Linguine fruitti di mare! That's my favorite dish from this restaurant with extra squid! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Got our food 1 hour we placed our order for 2 people. We got cold food, and bad service not a single apology but a bunch of excuses. Don't tell me it takes longerto cook chicken out of all the meats you cook. Surely not an hour for 6 pieces of chicken. If I could give it a zero, I would."}
{"text":"I had so many people tell me I \"had\" to go to this place that I finally broke down and went.  It was \"moving weekend\" we were all exhausted and starving.  I figured \"family style\" would be great.  So we went.  Biggest mistake EVER.  The staff was friendly (thus one star) the Caprese Salad was wonderful (thus the second star)  BUT...the service was extremely slow, and the food was tasteless.  I couldn't even taste \"garlic\" on the garlic bread.  Our waitress was less than informed about the dishes and when we asked for recommendations she said...\"It depends on what you like\" and we asked what other people ordered the most of and she again told us \"it varies\".  Then when our order FINALLY arrived, they came out 10 minutes later with the same order.  It seems the kitchen was doubling orders or something.  It was a confusing mess.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and got right in!  The service was amazing and very friendly.  I had the ceasar salad (which was THE BEST ceasar salad I have ever had in my life)  Also ordered the chicken parmesan (lunch portion - not the normal HUGE one) and it was still almost more then I could eat.  It really was probably in my top 3 of the best chicken parmesan I have ever ate in my life.  I am a sucker for it!  We sat there for about 2 hours talking (was kind of a business meeting) and they kept refilling us, and it was pleasant.  I love this location (besides the construction going on around downtown Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"First of all, we went at about 2:00 and the place was dead, but we were asked to wait 15 min (which turned out to be closer to 25)  Seriously, there was NO ONE in the place.  Finally we got sat down and the service was good (which is the only reason they are getting a  2 star review)  Getting sat down revealed what I just said too - there was hardly ANYONE in the whole place, yet I still had to wait almost 25 min.  shhheeesh!!!

My food was burnt, and there was not much sauce and it did not taste fresh like the other one I just ate at a few days ago.  

In all fairness my wife had the chicken cannelloni and said hers was about a \"4\" and I tasted it and hers was better then mine, but still I was not impressed with the wait or MY food.

I probably will not be back to this location ... ever again.  I will stick to the downtown Scottsdale location ... they seem to have it more together there!"}
{"text":"Excellent value and service for family meals.  \"Steve\" was our wait server today and provided fantastic service.....appreciate the extra attention to detail and service....he is fantastic.  As Italian family meals go, Buca always delivers!"}
{"text":"Must say, the customer service after the event was great.  The Manager of the Valley area, called and apologized many times, didnt make excuses, and took full responsibility.  He has renewed my faith in Bucca, and will try them again.  Changing my rating 4 stars."}
{"text":"First off if you come here you'll have to pay to park, no street parking or free lots.

We had a Groupon here.  We were seated on the 3rd floor of a near empty place for lunch, kind of odd.

Family style food, very good.  NO FREE BREAD.  You lost me right there!  Every thing here warrants a charge.  Wouldn't go back without the Discount."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and given it was busy and packed, it assured my expectations would be met or even exceeded. I made reservations through OpenTable and was certainly glad I did as there was an hour and a half wait without one.  The service was excellent from the hostess to waitress.  The Fettuccine Supremo was underwhelming as there wasn't any seasoning or much taste to it- I had to add salt and pepper to liven it up. All of the other dishes I observed other people order looked amazing and it seemed as if the taste matches it. Maybe I'll try another dish and my palette will be satisfied the next go 'round.  Oh yeah, the Groupon came in handy, so with the garlic bread, drinks, and entree, our total came to $4.30 with the Groupon. Not bad for a party of two."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend eating there. The food is really amazing. I would highly recommend you try the spicy chicken pasta. The waiter was also incredibly helpful. Absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"this place is fun to eat, there are usually nice servers, and they are prompt with bringing your food and drinks to you."}
{"text":"Julie is the worst waitress. She either can't hear, or she's not paying attention. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and enjoyed the meal and experience. However at 7:20 pm on a Thursday evening the restaurant had a 45 minute wait. There were many available tables. The problem was understaffing and the inability to take new diners in a reasonable time. I watched 19 people leave because of the wait time and more people trying to come in the door. Management was unsympathetic and just shrugged off people's complaints. So we went looking for another Italian restaurant in the area. Not sure I'll ever go back to Buca."}
{"text":"Before going to see The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (which wasn't actually so incredible, save your money and wait for it to come out on Redbox) the BFF and I decided that we couldn't live without cheesy bread and figured this place would have it.  When we walked in there were a few people waiting in the lobby and were told it would be a 35 minute wait for a table.  We were starving at that point and really didn't care about a regular table so we just went to the bar and sat there.

The bartender gave us our menus and explained that everything is served family style so when an item says \"Small\" it servers 2-3 people and \"Large\" serves 5-6.  We decided on Spaghetti with meatballs (1/2 lb. ones at that!!!) and obviously a side of cheesy bread.  A few minutes after ordering we were also brought a basket of fresh bread with oil and vinegar to dip it in.  I didn't really like though that they just use a plate for the oil and vinegar and after the server pours it they take it away.  Ummmm, sorry for my fat kid tendencies but I like to DUNK my bread in that goodness, not lightly dab at it.  So obviously we ran out pretty quickly and had to ask for more.  I wish they would have just left the bottles of the stuff with us so we had some control over it.  Are oil and vinegar hot on the black market right now or something??  I feel so out of the loop!

The cheesy bread came out next and was A-MAZ-ING!  Perfectly crispy on the crust, soft and fluffy in the middle and covered with delicious melty cheese and garlic!  We had asked for marinara sauce on the side too but the stuff was so good I actually preferred it sauceless.  A few minutes after that the spaghetti came out with what looked like two round meatloaves on it, seriously these things were huge!!  Beyond the size of the meatballs I wasn't impressed with the spaghetti at all though.  The sauce was bland without any kick and the meatballs didn't have much seasoning at all and when you're an Italian restaurant you need to be able to do a good job even on the basics.

I will go back just due to the cheesy bread and the fact that our server was great but I definitely won't be ordering the spaghetti again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really like this place.  We used to go to Olive Garden all the time for salad and mussels, but this place beats it by far.  Bucca's mussels bianca, and apple gorgonzola salad are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went to Buca the other day with my in-laws. It is definitely a place to go if you all have similar tastes, or else nobody will be happy. I personally liked the food a lot, but I was craving good comfort food and it definitely delivered."}
{"text":"I already have low expectations for cookie cutter restaurants, but this particular dining experience failed to meet even minimum expectations.  We ordered salad, pizza, and rigatoni.  The pizza arrived first, then the salad about 10 minutes later.  The bread arrived shortly after the salad.  After 30 more minutes, we cancelled the rigatoni, since we had already eaten the pizza, salad, and bread.  The waitress offered us the rigatoni to-go, but we declined.  I won't be in a hurry to return to this or any Buca di Beppo."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Bucca fan. It never takes long for us to be seated, the servers are always friendly, the food is always great, and the desserts are alway HUGE. The only complaint, which really isn't even a complaint, is that when we sit in the bar area, there are always flies. I grew up ghetto, so it isn't a big enough deal to remove a star. LOL"}
{"text":"I don't do Italian very often but on a recent trip to Pittsburgh I stopped into Buca di Beppo directly from the airport. I have been to one of this chains locations in Dallas and was impressed with the food and family style portions. The Pittsburgh location didn't disappoint. We ordered the trio appetizer that included fried cheese, calamari and perfectly done stuffed mushrooms. For the entrees we opted for the stuffed shells w/ marinara sauce (stuffed with spinach, ricotta cheese, Italian sweet sausage and Italian spices) and spicy chicken rigatoni. The portions where stupid big but cooked to a fresh perfection. The service was above average and the atmosphere was uniquely over the top Italian. If your into large quantities of Italian food done right, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for Valentine's dinner and got the same fun quirky service I've come to love at Buca. Our server Kenny was very humorous and really made the experience. Kudos to him!

We ordered the heart-shaped lasagna with a side meatball (cuz cmon, how can you go to Buca and NOT order one of those gigantic awesome meatballs!?). The lasagna seemed even more delicious than their typical rendition which is hard to do! The meatball was juicy and cooked to perfection. We also ordered the strawberry Italian soda with cream which I super recommend if you're not sure what to order for a drink.

Now, we were of course waaaay too stuffed to order dessert, but I'm gonna put my little plug here about that humongous sundae they have. It is nothing short of phenomenal. I must warn you however that you'll need at least four people to finish that thing unless you're Adam Richman (we were in a party of four). This is obviously an item you can't take home, unless you like vanilla brownie soup.

If you are dying for some great quality Italian food, look no further than Buca di Beppo!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this restaurant quite a bit because the concept is great. Family style meals and lots of pasta are two of my favorite things, but recently the service has been lacking and they seem to overwork 1 waiter to the brink of meltdown. We sat down and asked for water which took 10 minutes to get to us and then ordered our meal, but the bread was not presented to us until after we finished out first appetizer and it was without the oil and vinegar. I remembered the bread being warm and soft but it was neither this time around which is disappointing. The seafood trio platter was ok and I think it was suppose to come with marinara sauce on the side but we did not get that. I then ordered a salad, custom pasta and salmon to share with my family. The food was ok and well plated but it didn't stand out. Overall I felt the experience underwhelming and I feel that the management needs to do something about the short wait staff."}
{"text":"My partner and I decided to go here because we were tired and did not feel like leaving the strip. We were both disappointed. I put our name in and was told that it would take twenty minutes to be seated; it ended up taking thirty.

The service was okay if you were paying $30-40 for a meal. We ordered a small gorgonzola salad, a small pepperoni pizza, a small chicken saltimbocca, garlic mashed potatoes and two (plastic) glasses of water. This meal came to $82 without counting tip!

The salad was okay, the pizza was very salty and flat, the chicken was average, there was not much garlic taste to the mashed potatoes and the water was chlorinated with not even a lemon wedge to mask the taste.

Their \"family-style\" philosophy forces you into sharing entrees rather than ordering your own meal. You see, the small portions are supposed to be shared. So I guess people who are dining alone are not welcome.

The service was surly and polite. Take your money and go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"The proximity to UNLV is great. The decor, fun and funky. That's about all the good things I can say about this location.

Seating was prompt, the server was not. It took awhile to get our server's attention when we were ready to order. My friend is gluten free so we both ordered from that menu. We came around lunch time but there is only one lunch entree that is GF, so we were forced to get that and something from the dinner menu.  Also had an antipasto salad.

We stated from the start that my friend is gluten free, and we were ordering from the GF menu. Yet when our entrees came, there was pasta in it. The server said it was GF. Having cooked GF pasta before, and doing research on this establishment, no.. That was not GF pasta, particularly since they never ever have served it at Buca.

About 30 minutes later we got our dish again, this time with like 4 pieces of broccoli. The chicken breast (chicken limone) was considerably small. We also got chicken marsala, which consisted of 3 chicken breasts and like 5 mushrooms. Really need a starch in there. Could they not have put potatoes on the side?

I think we spent about 3 hours and $40 here, all for 4 small chicken breasts, a salad and not much else. I've read about their huge portions. Not the case for GF items."}
{"text":"Brought my son and daughter in law for a birthday dinner as we have enjoyed Buca several times in the past.  Good Lord what happened to this place? We made reservations and were seated quickly and then the service \"four corners\" started.  Our salad was delivered and we had to ask twice for plates and silverware.  5 minutes staring at our salad bowl and they finally brought some.  We had to ask for refills, bread plates and we finally went and grabbed our own plates and olive oil.  The salad and bread were tasty. The entrees were usually good with the exception of the Alfredo pasta was cold, pasta not cooked enough and needed salt.  The chicken in pesto cream sauce was outstanding.  Overall a disappointing dinner with the food average and service horrible.  Next time we may should look else where."}
{"text":"I was in charge of planning a company lunch at Buca di Beppo.  My contact there was Jennifer Brugger, sales manager.  It was a pleasure working with Jennifer.  She was very helpful getting our date set up, and promptly got menus over to us, for us to choose from.  She was quick to respond to any of my correspondence and was always helpful and friendly.
We were accommodated in a large room upstairs, which was perfect for our group.  Food was plentiful and quality was spot on.  All the dishes we chose were tasty and the servers were fantastic.
Our company will definitely keep Buca di Beppo in mind for any of our future needs!"}
{"text":"This location is not very good.  I love buca but this location has gone way downhill.   Ordered spagetti and meatballs, the meatballs sucked. they ran out of bread. lucky I dont give this 1 star"}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience on 4/13, I walked up and management offered me a high top table immediately in the bar area since I was dining alone.  Michael was my server and made great recommendations and favorites on the menu, I went with the baked rigatoni with spicy sausage. The cheese compliments the sauce well with fresh mozzarella on top. The white sangria is also good and was garnished with fresh fruit. Great experience and staff will be back again for some excellent italian food!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 5 for 6:15 and show up at 5:40 only to be told we have to wait til our reservation time, fine no big deal. Then a party of 50 show up and they get priority. I get it, that's a guaranteed BIG bill/check so lots of money for the restaurant but still need to treat the small parties like they matter"}

Excellent foid,ss always! Thanks again! Sherri H."}
{"text":"The usual big portions. Not the greatest Italian restaurant when it cones to flavor.  But great for an inexpensive place to entertain a big group."}
{"text":"Mama Mia that's some good cheese......

Stopped by the mall on the way home the other night, and somehow ended up at the end of the parking lot in a dead end right in front of Buca Di Beppo.  Not sure what drove me into this location tonight, as I have only heard of the GINORMOUS portion sizes, and we were in the mood for something very light, and did not want anything real heavy. I know, this is Italian and everything is heavy, but we decided to give them a try since the parking lot was not nearly as full as normal.  (That could be good, or that could be bad) Anyhooo...we felt like an adventure none the less.

Since this was our true \"first visit\" we felt in order to take the tour....through the maze, into the kitchen, (hey look someone is actually eating in the kitchen) and onto the myriad of other rooms, finally locating our table in a room, with just one other \"festive\" couple.  Apparently a few servers had been cut, so there were a few questions as to who actually had our table.  One would think that was bad, however we did have at least three servers attend to our needs at the very beginning.

Of course, by now, you know I drink water, and my better have always has sweet tea. The drinks were quickly presented and we placed our very huge order of just the Mozzarella Cheese.  We had the complimentary basket of bread, with Olive Oil / Balsamic Vinegar, to help soak up the very tasty Marinara Sauce left over from the Cheese Sticks.

The portion sizes were reasonable for the price, and as expected, it was enough to feed both of us, especially the 2 sections of bread.

This will be on the list for us to visit later on, we when are hungry.

Service was fast and friendly.

{"text":"Outstanding experience as usual. We were seated promptly and greeted by our server just as quickly. It's always nice to see our favorites in the menu, such as the caprese starter and the pear gorgonzola salad, but equally refreshing to see new additions to the menu as well. Cocktails were good too. In all, another great family dinner night out and we're already looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Being from California I've seen this place a few times off the freeway. I've always wanted to stop there, but never any time. So when my fiance's best friend (who lives in Vegas) said we should go here I was instantly happy. And it was even better than I had imagined. 
    When I walked in I felt as though I had walked in to a restaurant in Italy. The decor was funny, like an Italian version of TGIF. But it only added to the whole experience. We wound up spending WAY too much for three people and getting WAY WAY too much food, too. But it was VERY much worth it. The food was awesome. And the quantity was huge. Although it seems a little ridiculous for them to charge $2 for a side of marinara sauce when we just got two $11 appetizers...but hey that's a fancy place for you. Had we ordered one dish and one appetizer I think we would have been perfect...but when your in Vegas you go big or go home. 
     This restaurant is perfect for any size party and for any occasion. The staff is very friendly, and pretty prompt. There selection is great, as well. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had takeout Saturday night. We ordered the fettuccine with chicken it was terrible. The sauce and chicken had no flavor and it was cold. Would much rather have Olive Garden down the street."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start messed up the order had to wait 20 minutes for my wife's chicken everybody else at the table was finished eating. I ordered a fry provolone tasted freezer burnt and was smashed together. There was four of us the bill was $130 for pasta !  Come on $130 for pasta never again will I be at this restaurant !"}
{"text":"I visited the station square location (the second time I ever visited a Buca di Beppo period) this past saturday for my bf's niece's 18th birthday late lunch/early dinner. I expected it to be on par with Olive Garden (which I'm not a fan of the \"commercialized\" Italian places) but I agreed with the reasoning behind going here-we were a party of 11, the food is family style, and there should be enough variety ordered for everyone. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. First I will say, we should have been seated elsewhere. We were, again a party of 11, that was cramped into the back corner of the basement (near the bar), and anytime someone had to get up to use the restroom, there would be a lot of shuffling and getting up amongst everyone. Considering it was 3pm, it was not crowded at all and we could have been sat elsewhere. Our server, Cody, was very efficient-constantly refilling drinks, getting new plates,etc. For appetizers we ordered:the artichoke florentine dip,the fried calamari,the stuffed mushrooms, and the mozzarella garlic bread. In particular, the stuffed mushrooms were excellent (the sage and rosemary flavors were very prevalent) as was the artichoke dip. This was just enough food to satisfy until the entrees arrived. For salads we ordered an apple gorgonzola salad ,which was excellent but is very commonplace at restaurants currently, and a mixed greens salad. As for entrees: the prosciutto stuffed chicken, the veal marsala (my favorite-the sauce was sweeter than a typical marsala and paired excellently with the veal),chicken and sausage ziti (the sausage had a little surprising kick to it although it was supposed to be the mild sausage),spaghetti with meatballs ( I did not sample this but looked basic minus the gigantic meatballs),vegetable lasagna (I did not partake in this either),stuffed shells (I particularly enjoyed the sausage in them). We did bring our own dessert so I cannot comment on that either but I will say my expectations were far exceeded with the quality of the food since this is a \"chain restaurant\". Our party also got a kick out of the decor!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I placed the order on line ( for pick up) yesterday. Still had to wait 1/2 an hour for the food 
They forgot the Cannoli's !!! 
$200 in food and they gave me 4 pieces of bread !!?
Yikes"}
{"text":"Food is standard as usual but service was slow and rude. We were waiting for a while before we can order, tried to get attention from a waitress and she ended up responded back with an attitude about how she doesn't serve our table. Our waiter then came but made us waited even more before we were able to order . As the food was on the table water wasn't filled once. No greeting nor caring. Then as we asked for the bill he made us waited again. Finally we left and not wanting to ever visit again"}
{"text":"Well it is Christmas Eve and we come to this restaurant kind of as a family tradition. Well we've been here two hours overs and we have yet to see our dinner? Its busy but not that busy. I had to get up and get hot peppers oil and vinegar myself. The restaurant should be able to accommodate its patrons. This is really kind of ridiculous and I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Make sure you specify that you want the garlic mozzarella bread with your entree ($7.99) not an appetizer($9.99) even though its not listed on the menu as an appetizer. According to the manager they got new menus in January...I wonder how much extra money they made from this mistake for almost 2 months? Oh and we were the first people to notice! Ha Food was good service horrible. Now I remember why I don't come here."}
{"text":"Uuuuuuuugh. 

If vegetables, pasta sauces that don't taste like generic canned marinara, and any peace and calm are high priorities in your dining experience, don't go to Buca. It's a vegetarian's nightmare (you can eat salad or desperately search the menu for something devoid of meat). The family style setting kind of defeats the purpose of going to a restaurant anyway (\"Instead of all eating the same meal in, let's go out so we can all share the same two dishes!\"). The rooms are loud, the food overpriced, and the experience is stressful. 

Again, uuuuuuuugh."}
{"text":"This is unfortunate.  I hadn't been to a Buca in a long time.  Now I know why.  I've been on their email list for years and finally took my family to try it.  
First, we showed up with a reservation.  Of course the place was packed on a Saturday night, but we were seated 30 minutes after our reservation.  Not acceptable. 
Second, they brought our salad but no plates.  We waited a good 5 mins before someone brought our salad plates to us.  PS they charge an absurd amount of money for their salads.  We asked for bread which was quickly plopped on our table. No butter, no vinegar and no one around to ask for some.
Then came the appetizer (fried mozza) which was lukewarm.   
The entrees were good (hence the 1 star) but they are not worth the money.  
The service was really bad.  Our server was nice but she needs ALOT more training.  Some running around like crazy, and some were meandering around looking like they had nothing to do.  
Last, the bathroom was disgusting.
I am really disappointed.  So much so that I may call and complain.  I rarely do this.  I didn't say anything at the restaurant because they were still really busy.  But it was just not a pleasant evening.  We paid a lot of money and walked away unhappy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit at this location! service was on point & for the price it cant get much better. I would recommend it if you want to have a fun time with friends but not break the bank."}
{"text":"Always the best food never have anything to complain about this place the staff is great the service is great and the food is great can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great service but terrible tasting food.  Our pasta had an extremely aged garlic taste, the cannolis are hard, the cream its tateless or more like oil taste.  Huge servince with a lack of taste.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Buca Di Beppo in a few years and I won't be going back for at least a few more (until the memories of my experience fade, at least). 

First of all, it's incredibly expensive. I understand it's meant to be served family style, but my fiancee and I ordered a single dish, and had a coupon for another free one, a small order of garlic bread and two waters. Our bill: $32 - for ONE dish and garlic bread! It's ridiculous!

Second, the service was terrible. 30 minutes after we were seated, we finally had the chance to order. This isn't to say the waitress didn't come to the table, she did. It's just that when she did, she was in such a hurry that all we could eek out before she was rushing away was that we wanted two waters. We were there for an hour and a half for spagetti. I will just make this at home from now on.

Third, the way the restaurant is laid out, it's VERY loud. There was a party of about 10 people next to us, and my fiancee and I couldn't even hear each other talk. So we say in silence. Now, this is not the restaurants fault, but these people were OBNOXIOUS. The management should have said something. 

And finally, the food is terrible. It reminded me of food made at summer camp - you know what I'm talking about - the mass produced kind with standard pasta and sauce. My fiancee also noted that his chicken parmigiana was terrible and that it's better at Olive Garden. A restaurant I will be sticking with from here on out :)"}
{"text":"We ate there on Saturday night. We had reservations for 5pm, we arrived at 5pm and still had a wait. The place was pretty much empty. There were a ton of tables. We were told 5 minutes. 15 minutes went by and we were going to leave. We had hockey tickets and still needed to catch a cab. That's why I made reservations in the first place!!! Right at the 15 minute mark we were seated. Our waiter was great, helpful and friendly. The décor is outdated and dusty, yes dust coming from the lights over the tables but the food was good and the service was good. if you're staying at Luxor or Excalibur you get a $10 off coupon at check in. Use it and enjoy!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food, we were served rubbery calimari appetizers with a tomato sauce that tasted like we poured it from a can! Pizza was more like a chrispy quesadilla, then came our entrees, I had the Pasta de Mare, mussels were cold 4 shrimp (very small), should have made dinner at home, won't be going back there.  They really need to step it up!"}
{"text":"I have to say, as a local here in Las Vegas, I hate crappy service.  Went with a couple of out of town friends for a total of four people.  Our waiter was just plain in a funk.  Service was slow, food arrived before we could finish the salad (Is it pre-cooked?) No plates provided until we flagged someone down. Never refilled beverages without us asking.  When he cleared the table, he reached into the center of the table and began stacking all the used plates right in our faces. No finesse at all. everything as far as service is in slow motion, and you get ignored a lot.  The only thing I must admit they do with great expediency is drop the check on the table.  Oh and by the way, not once did  any staff member say thank you, while we all thanked them every time they brought us something.  Sorry just poor service, but the food was not too bad."}
{"text":"Lamad is the BEST server I've ever encountered in my 22 years on this planet. I've eaten at hundreds and hundreds of restaurants and have never encountered a server that is so friendly. You can just tell that he loves his job. Amazing personality and he makes us feel at home everytime! Great knowledge of the menu and always gets our order on the table quickly and correctly. I'd visit here solely for his service but the food is yummy too!"}
{"text":"Like other comments. This was our go to place for special occasions. Love the food and decor. We were here on 08/02 for our 36 year wedding anniversary. The service was terrible, apathetic, Etc. Etc. During past visits the waiter made a big deal out of bringing Fresh bread and pouring oil and balsamic vinegar in the dish on the table. This visit I finally had to ask for bread after we got our antipasto and entrées. He brought it and the bread was cold. Same with the wine we ordered. Took forever to get two glasses of wine. Not sure if this will be our go to place anymore."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times with my husband. Service and food were great, except the portions are too big unless you are sharing a plate. Great restaurant for families or large appetites. Wish they had smaller items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was not horrible but it was not great, either.  We had to wait about 20 min to get a table to find that the restaurant was almost empty.  We later learned that it was understaffed.  Our waitress, Andie was attentive but her kindness was fake.  It looked like it pained her smile.  If we knew the restaurant served family portions, we would have decided to go somewhere else.  I was bummed that I couldn't order a side salad.  The only option was a large salad for 2-3 people.  The pizza we ordered was good, but the middle slices were undercooked."}
{"text":"Being in food service I would say they could cater a little more to the couples out there. Good is served family style so you have to agree on an item. Food was ok, but it took a long time for them to get it to the table. This place was not very busy at the time. I think it would've been a lot better if we had been with a group if six or more."}
{"text":"OK food, poor service and by poor, mean SLOW.  Also, the night we went, the place ran out of ICE??  Brutal.   Guess its ok to bring your kids to"}
{"text":"Ate here twice and the meal was comped both times because of ridiculously slow service and below-average food quality. 

For the price, the food quality just isn't there. 

Sorry Buca but you need to be better."}
{"text":"Food was great, plenty to eat and share with the family. Service was fast and fantastic! Had Jarrett as a server, he was nice and helped us navigate through the menu. I would recommend this place to any Italian food lover"}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner at Bucca di Beppo in Excalibur last Saturday  We had a party of 24 and arranged everything ahead of time.  We had to order from the banquet menu and our food for 24 included bread, cesar salad, Italian salad, fettuccini alfredo, spaghetti marinara, chicken parmesan and cheesecake.  It was so much food, and quite excellent.  They were more than willing to substitute chocolate cake for my three little picky eaters and made my nieces special day extra special.  The servers were very attentive and we never had to want for anything.  The manager personally oversaw our dinner.  Overall it was an excellent experience that I enjoyed with my wedding party."}
{"text":"We got here around 7:30pm ordered salad, pizza, pasta and chicken entree.  It took about 30 mins to get salad.  Then we waited another 50 mins for pasta and chicken. When we finished our pasta and chicken, server was asking if were ready for dessert.  She forgot to ring pizza ........ we ordered large pizza... and she said it will take 6 mins.  Of course waited another 20 mins. Then got a SMALL pizza which she said she will take off of the check.  Literally 2 hours dinner.. walked out at 9:35pm.  Ruined our holiday family dinner...."}
{"text":"We were not told it was going to be busy. We had to ask for water and bread. Our orders were taken including my margarita. It was the wrong margarita and it took over 30 minutes to get the drink and food. Food came no salad with my boyfriends food we ate for 15 minutes an additional 10 minutes for our tab we were for two hours never again it took me years to come back from the last service. Their excuse??? Sorry we are busy! What is that???"}
{"text":"If you're looking to grab some good Italian food for dinner, then this place is great. Whether you're going with your family or on a date, it doesn't matter because the atmosphere of this place is unlike any other place you'll go.

Walking in, heck, even the outside of the place, you'll be amazed at the tackiness. Being half Italian, this place brings back a lot of memories of my grandmother's place. It's just so amazingly tacky, from the different types of rooms you can eat in, to the stuff on the walls & ceilings. 

Buca is unique because of how they separate the seating. There are different types of themes for each room & each is very unique. I've sat in the Wine Room twice & filled wine racks cover the entire ceiling. There's also a pope room, with a spinning pope head in the middle of the table...yes...very weird. Also, I believe you have to reserve the booth located in the kitchen, but this is where you can watch the workings of the kitchen from inside of it.

The food here is great as well, with your normal favorites with some other odd creations. They have giant meatballs which are great for more than one person. You can order individual portions, but they're specialty is family style dining. So bring some people with you that have hearty appetites because you get a lot of food here.

This place may be a chain, but it's definitely a must visit if you're an Italian food fan...which I have no idea who isn't. From the uniqueness & tackiness of the place, to the great food you'll get to feed your whole party, you'll enjoy yourself & look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Our party had 4PM reservations for Christmas day, party of 10. Despite not seeming to be too busy (the room we were in was completely empty, at first), we had to request waitress service twice to get water and place our orders. We did not receive any food, other than bread, for 90 minutes. It took two hours to receive our entrees, and they came out slowly over another half hour or so. 

The manager came to talk to us before the food came out and told us their systems were down and the 'to go' orders had been lost, so everyone who had called ahead to place orders who then came in to pick up their food had to reorder at that time. Those people I feel terribly for- they were all rowdy and stuck in the foyer when we were leaving and someone said the restaurant had closed early because of the back up. And people were still arriving with reservations. 

The waitress was clearly upset and angry, and was not attentive to the table and was defensive when she was asked questions or received complaints about the wait or whether the right food was coming to the table (because total orders were not coming, just half orders then later more half orders). 

The people behind us finally left after not getting any food for 90 minutes, and then only getting a tiny pizza to split for a table of ten. Many people had kids with them, and by now the room we were in was full and we were the only ones eating. 

The food was fantastic. I have read the portions are huge at this place, but we did not experience that. The food portions were acceptable but not typical of Family Style in my experience. The chicken in the dishes was perfectly cooked and the chicken parm was the best I have ever had, by far. I would love to have that again, but I will never go back."}
{"text":"I used Bucca for our catering needs for our wedding reception. Everything was just as I ordered. Was delivered on time, hot and ready to serve. Everyone loved the food. And we had plenty for seconds."}
{"text":"Unfortunately,Yelp requires you to give a rating. I can only give one star here. Service was ok. But the food was AWFUL ! There was no flavor,gloopy noodles,and undercooked meatballs. My son had to excuse himself from the table and was literally sick to his stomach after just eating a few bites. We paid $122 dollars for food that was inedible ! We will never eat at another Bucco De Beppo again !"}
{"text":"The food was very good but the prices were a bit high and everything is pretty much ala carte. No bread on the table or the like.

The espresso we had was good as was the pizza. My party seemed to enjoy their meals as well. I've also been to the location in Albany which I've liked. It's not authentic but it's a good choice for quick Italian."}
{"text":"WTF. A friend of mine has been to the one in L.A (?) and loved it so we went here while we visited LV. We were STARVING. We waited FOREVER to be seated. We ordered Fettucine Alfredo, because who could go wrong with Fettucine Alfredo, right? WRONG. it was a huge pile of dried noodles with a sticky, thick, gooey, dry-tasting sauce. Two other tables near us complained about how horrible the food tasted. One guy said what we were thinking, \"it's like my food had been sitting out for half a day.\" Unfortunately, i could no longer eat because I was quite nauseas, and so was my friend. We left feeling sick and extremely disappointed. What a way to ruin a good Las Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Do not recommend if going as a couple!
We had a reservation for 2 adults through Open Table at 6:45 on a Saturday evening. We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation.
As we were being escorted to our table at 6:45 we walked through a very quiet room with booths and small tables where couples were dining. We were not seated there. We were instead seated in a larger, very noisy crowded room with parties of 6, 8, and 10+ sitting around us.
We ordered soft drinks, salad and 1 pasta dish to share.
We were served our salad 30 minutes after ordering and our pasta 60 minutes after ordering. We were not offered bread at any time-we had to ask for it when the pasta was delivered. The pasta dish was served barely warm. We would have sent it back to the kitchen but at that point were disgusted and hungry and wanted to finish up and leave. We were never asked by our waiter how the meal was. He never came back to check on us until we asked for the check. I was prepared to let the young man know EXACTLY how it was! Didn't have the opportunity so I saved my review for Yelp.
We were brought a refill on one of our soft drinks after we had finished our meal and asked for the check. We asked for a to go box to take home leftovers and never received it...had to ask for it a second time after paying the bill. It was over a 2 hour experience! Sorry-not acceptable for a party of 2 that didn't even order a cocktail prior to dinner or an appetizer. Clearly the wait staff was over run with large parties and were unable to tend to our simple needs. Waiters were also bussing their own tables which takes away from waiting on customers. Couldn't enjoy general conversation due to high noise level in the room."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the family style type of dining. The staff was really friendly, the service was fast, and it felt like i was going to dinner at one of my relatives house! Pizza, pasta, salad....everything was great. Big groups are a must and they have monthly specials that cater to all celbrations that you may be planning."}
{"text":"The portions are huge, and stated as such. So we ordered three \"small\" potions to share between the four of us. We still went home with leftovers! Everyone was delish and the staff was very friendly. Recommend the chicken cannelloni, sooo good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Buca di Beppo in years, and I recently had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant with my friends here in Vegas.  From the moment you walk into the restaurant, there is tons of excitement and energy!  Love it! 

First, you have to set expectations before eating here and writing a review - it is a family style restaurant that caters to large groups.   This is not a James Beard Award Winning restaurant, but it is a fun place for groups to grab a meal together.

I called in to make a reservation for 8 people at 7:00 p.m. and Miss Hostess was the nicest person I've encountered in a long time!  Easy Peasy!  When we got to the restaurant, we were greeted by three lovely hostesses.  We were told to wait 5 minutes for them to set up our table (HUH?  The restaurant was half empty!).  After being seated, we were quickly greeted and served by lovely Miss Server Shennae!

For starters, we got the Apple Gorgonzola Salad (Small for 4).  The salad was your typical green salad but was loaded with gorgonzola cheese, thinly sliced Granny Apples, walnuts and cranberries.  It was light, fresh, and tasty!   Grade:  B

For the main dish, we got the Frutti di Mare Pasta (Small for 4).  The pasta was topped with mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari.   The pasa noodles were tossed with a rich and spicy marinara sauce.  I loved the taste of this dish.  I didn't like the texture of the noodles.  It tasted like either the noodles were over cooked or were a cheap brand of noodles.  The texture was mushy and did not have a chew to it like most noodles should have.    Grade:  B-

The kiddos at the table ordered from the kid's menu ($5!).  Each had a personalized sized cheese pizza or spaghetti and meatballs.  Both selections were VERY generous and large!  The pizzas were 9\" across.  The spaghetti and meatballs was served in a medium sized pasta bowl and looked like it was enough for 2 adults.   (It looked so tasty, I wanted to eat the leftovers of the kids, but I refrained!).   Grade:  A!

Best part of the meal was the energy and smiles of Miss Server Shennae!  She was patient and really made it an enjoyable evening!  You can tell she loves her job!  Thanks a bunch, Shennae!

Food Grade:  B
Service Grade:  A!
Worth the Money Grade:  B-  (sorry, the bad pasta noodles and prices did this)
Overall Impression Grade:  B"}
{"text":"Didn't actually eat there, but found ourselves in the lobby after a laborious time trying to escape the seedy area via cab.  Manager gave us complimentary water bottles and directed us to the casino across the street for a cab.  Such incredible service, life saver!"}
{"text":"Buca De Beppo is a great place to go with all of your friends. I'm sick of being penalized with waits or reservations when a group of friends and I want to go out to eat at the last minute. Buca De Beppo however is different. With a family style menu and a mansion of a restaurant I have always got in very quickly. 

As I mentioned the menu is made to be ordered in either medium or large portions. The Medium portions are for about two or three people and the large are more around four or five. Last time I was there we had polenta and garlic breadf or appetizers. For entrees we had Caesar salad, chicken parmesan, and the manacotti. This was for six starving people. The chicken Parmesan is unlike any I have had. Instead of a basic fried chicken breast they  grill it and top it off with fresh tomato sauce and a little sprinkled cheese. The manacotti was also delicious and the cheese was so filling I could barely finish one.

 Our waitress was a bit flighty but she was nice. The ambiance of Buca is also very interesting you won't spend a dull moment at your table because the walls are engrossed with quirky photographs."}
{"text":"We're in Vegas.... I have NO idea why we ate here instead of the hundreds of other amazing restaurants on the strip.

It wasn't bad, but I would def recommend going to someplace you can only eat in Vegas!! It's the same price anyhow.."}
{"text":"Heard back from the divisional Vice President who was responsible for this restaurant.  I appreciate the follow-up and concern.  He plans to talk to the employees.  He invited me back at his expense.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Good family style southern Italian food! Good and friendly service . Not far from a 5 star rating. This place is really good !!! Can't wait to return and try more of the menu! !!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a coupon for $10 off $30... so, why not? We went for lunch. When we walked in, we asked if we could sit in the bar area and use the coupon still. The hostesses, who were holding menus and ready to seat us, said yes. We ended up seating ourselves like normal customers who decide to sit in the bar area, but we were completely ignored for a good seven to ten minutes or so... without menus! Finally, our server came up to us and asked if we needed menus. Duh. I have never been to a Buca di Beppo in my whole, entire life, so yes. I would very much like a menu. Well, the server ended up being pretty nice, though. He took our order in a timely manner, and he refilled our drinks when needed. I ordered the baked ziti, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken carbonara. The chicken on his dish wasn't all that good, as it tasted like frozen chicken or pre-cooked chicken. Other than that, the food was good. Our bill came out to $27 after the $10 off (without tip), which isn't bad, because we didn't finish our meals and had leftovers to take back to the room for dinner! I would rate the experience as three and a half stars... but I'll round up."}
{"text":"The service at this place is horrible. My friend and I were there for 10 minutes watching the manager try hard not to make eye contact. Eventually we ordered from the bartender at the bar. As soon as I got back to the table, the manager came to take our order. 

I'd give it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The server Jarrett was very helpful and made my birthday dinner amazing! He had a great, positive attitude and was very funny. The food servings were huge and fed the whole group, too!"}
{"text":"Appetizers came 40 minutes after ordering. Still waiting on entrees. It's not even that busy in here yet. Wait times are way too long. Food quality is tbd. Better be worth it. Not a happy eater right now"}
{"text":"This review actually pains me a little bit because Buca Di Beppo used to be my favorite Italian restaurant in the valley up until new owners came in and started changing the menu to the point where the food wasn't nearly as good as what it once was and now it just seems so average. On the flipside the service and the atmosphere didn't change and still remains excellent but still doesn't make up for the change in food. Maybe another visit will change my view but for right now still label me disappointed."}
{"text":"To start off the bar in this one is good. The restaurant not so much. Thankfully a lady sitting in another booth told us the garlic bread isn't that great and offered us a piece. Wasn't much 
 garlic at all. My salad wasn't good and dressing was bland. My friend went to sit down in the booth and it fell forward almost hurting him. The manger came out and fixed it but nothing else. Never offered to move us or offer anything.
We do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"There are plenty of fancy overly expensive italian places to choose from in Las Vegas. My husband and I were staying at the Monte Carlo and decided to try this place instead of something fancy. We were NOT disappointed!  The atmosphere is laid back and the food is so yummy. The staff is friendly too. It's also served family style in big dishes to share with the whole table. Perfect for a family meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and accommodate food allergies. Pricey but one of only a few place my entire family can eat safely. 

Very LARGE portions served family style."}
{"text":"My team just got done playing four fastpitch softball games in 110 degree weather and needed some pasta afterwards.  Buca di Beppo staff had all our food ready for us when we arrived and even stayed open for us after closing hours to allow us to finish our food!  Great staff and great people...thank you!!!"}
{"text":"The decor was a bit much, a very busy atmosphere to say the least. The food was decent, the pasta was good however the salad was on the salty side. As for the service; the waitress was forgetful and preoccupied even though the restaurant was not busy at all. We had to remind her to get us eating utensils. The drink menu was extremely overpriced as you get to keep the gimmicky glass that your drink is served in, and they don't give you an option to not get said glass."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely wonderful experience tonight, Valentine's Day. 

Our sever Nikki was probably the best server I've ever had. She was very kind and accommodating to my food allergy. 

We also overheard a portion of her conversation with the couple seated next to us who had never been to Buca before and weren't familiar with any Italian dishes at all. She explained everything to them and it was really impressive to see someone take such pleasure in explaining the menu. 

Buca is one of my favorite restaurants and people like Nikki really make your experience great."}
{"text":"I planned on coming here for my birthday next week, so my mother I decided to come and try it before... SOOO glad we did! The noodles weren't done, there was barely any sauce, no seasoning at all! Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Hands down best service in town! Micheal was such an amazing server! Attentive, funny, he really went out of his way to make sure we had a good time! My favorite's were the Giant Meatballs and also when Michael sang Happy Birthday to me! Thanks Bucca!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is horrible and your out of the very things I come here for! How does an Italian food place not have Italian cake?? To the server Ashely I'm not sure why you had a very BAD attitude with us you should probably take that up with your management for giving you too many tables! There were so many things you were RUDE about like when we asked for water with lemon. Well we got out waters no lemon! However I did happen to notice the table behind us got lemons perched up on their glasses of water no problem! Then you left us sitting with the oil and balsamic plate no bread! You may think we didn't notice you gave our bread to your other table much bigger party but we did! Its servers like you that will have me staying home more often!"}

{"text":"Food is amazing. Coupon we got in the mail was amazing and once service started it was decent. We arrived at 11:45 for lunch and stood at the front reception area until noon when someone finally came out and saw us. We got seated in the bar area and then ignored for a while again. Server came and asked us for drink order. Hot tea and water. That was another five minutes or so. So now it's 12:30 and we get to order. I ask for lasagna  (menu says not available until noon) and get told that it won't be ready until 2 or so. So I get chicken parmigiano.  It was Fantastic.  I would have been upset if we paid full price for this but having a buy one get one coupon made it worth what we paid. Dinner service is way better. Won't do lunch here again."}
{"text":"Great food & great service. Worth every dollar. always clean kid friendly. Server didn't just let us sit there checked on us often. I had a Groupon and that was great. Waiter was very nice about it. It was my mom's birthday lunch and our waiter just lit 3 candles and asked her to make a wish instead of singing, mom was very relieved."}
{"text":"Be prepared if you're a party of two. You will have left overs!! Portions are made for 3 or more!! We did the build your own pasta.  We had cavatappi pasta with meat sauce and meatballs. It hit the spot!! After a day at work, flew into Vegas and watched a concert!  We were super happy!!"}
{"text":"While visiting family in Las Vegas my husband and I had the pleasure of being taken to your restaurant. We had an incredible experience and the food was beyond the best we had while in Vegas. Service was top-notch ,k waiter was on top of our every need. This was our first visit to your restaurant but you can be sure next time we visit Vegas we will once again stop in for an incredible meal. We dined on an anti pasto salad, chicken parmesan and spaghetti. Fantastic meal."}
{"text":"We waited for an hour to be seated, and then left. They only had two servers working dinner. Several people were frustrated and left as well. Result of poor management."}
{"text":"I had to give it one star to post but no stars for the Station Square location would be overrated.  The worst food, bar none, that I have ever been served.  I have consulted yelp on many occasions but only now felt a need to forewarn my fellow diners: Avoid this place. We ordered a salad which was the only passable substance that was placed on our table.  The pasta marinara was overcooked cheap pasta with something like undrained pureed tomatoes for sauce.  It was literally floating in half a bowl of water.

We also ordered Chicken Marsala which came in a sauce that tasted like something between molasses and maple syrup.  That might fly on bacon or breakfast sausage but chicken and mushrooms?  Yikes.

The only high point was a reduction of about 90% on the bill after complaining.  Five stars to our waiter, he definitely did all he could to please us."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a pizza when you just took the late night flight into vegas. They have a Thursday - Saturday special. The food is plenty. Located on the food level at Excalibur."}
{"text":"So I got a coupon in the mail saying 15$ 0ff 30$ so I decided to try it ...I looked up the menu on the website that had no prices wich is so annoying ....I called and asked prices so I only had to spend so much for only myself ....when I show up the price is twice as much as the lady told me on the phone I told the manager he offered me only garlic bread or a dessert I saw bread in the bag so I chose desert he than didn't even ask me what kind I wanted and he told the waiter to bring me a tiramisu I don't even like chocolate !!!! I get the food home pull out the bread its not even garlic bread wich I had assumed ....what kind of Italian food does not serve garlic bread but just a piece of not toated bagatte ???? On top of paying twice as much on the food I wanted to .... The actual food it's self was cold and incredibly mediocre .... I could have done it better and cheaper by myself!!!! To bad I was lazy .... This place sucks I would never suggest it or go back"}
{"text":"Very interesting kitchen tour when you are taken to your table. Great food and interesting place with all the Italian pictures on the wall and music playing. I reserved the Pope romm a few years ago when I had family in town. I think you need about 12 or more to get that private romm but worth it if you have a large group."}
{"text":"Meh.  I've experienced better is right. 

Granted, I did come in with a HUGE party.  It was where our friends decided to gather to eat after their special occasion.  It had to of been about 50 people.  BUT you would think a restaurant that serves such large family style dishes, would be able to handle a party of that many, apparently for one of their staffers, not. 

So our food was basically preordered and the menu was set for us.  Food was okay, it wasn't spectacular thats why I can't even describe it.  I just wanted to review our service though. 

One of the waitresses, was frazzled from the very beginning.  Myself and a few other people in the party observed it early in our dinner.  I mean, she couldn't get the drink orders straight, kept forgetting to bring us simple utensils to eat our food, plates, too, it also took forever to bring our drinks to us.  When we were finally given the bill for our drinks, after requesting it 3x, we immediately gave our card since we had no cash to pay for it.  She came back and said I'm sorry I charged it out to cash, can you pay it by cash?  What?! Your mistake, you fix it.  I mean, why would you even bring that back to your customer.  It didn't upset us or anything, but it seems compared to her other coworkers that served flawlessly, she could not compare.  So our waitress, frazzled.  Not that she was mean to us particularly, but man she gave off she was having a bad day."}
{"text":"Good food but service wasn't great. The \"$8.99 lunch specials\" sign outside is pretty misleading, considering a soup and salad combo is $8.99 and the rest of the lunch entrees are about $12 and up. Our server told us we could order from the lunch menu or family style menu, which would probably save us a couple bucks if two or more of us wanted the same thing. You can definitely share even the lunch portions. We had the chicken parmigiana with spaghetti, the baked ziti and the spicy chicken rigatoni. All three were HUGE portions and I ate maybe 1/3 of mine. Our server was just kind of rude and insisted she couldn't split the appetizer between our checks (I waited tables for about five years and I find it hard to believe your computer system doesn't have that capability), but food was decent and not bad for the price compared to other Vegas restaurants."}
{"text":"Buca used to be one of our favorite restaurants, but the quality has gone downhill fast. After our visit this evening, we will not return.

Garlic bread was bland/favor-less. Not worth the price. Caesar salad was also bland, small and wilted. Totally not worth the $11. (It used to be my favorite thing at Buca, but clearly the dressing is not the same nor is the overall quality). The meatballs were \"okay\" but not the normal spectacular-ness. The quatro al forno/stuffed pasta combo plate was also okay, but nothing like it used to be. We also got some wine, a Buca Chianti, and it was also not worth the price tag. Overall the $100 price tag of this meal was a complete rip off. It was worth more like $40. We should have gone to Olive Garden -- at least you get what you pay for there.

Also the waitress didn't really seem to have any idea about the menu or current offers even though she had worked there for \"years.\" She was nice, but not very attentive. And to top it off the guests at the table next to us proceeded to yell and use tons of profanity and it was clear the employees noticed but did nothing. I don't particularly enjoy going to any restaurant and having to listen to that - nor do I want my young daughter to listen to it. And I certainly don't want to pay that much for that kind of experience. 

Buca has become one of those bad cookie cutter chain restaurants. They are overpriced and the food isn't that good. You are better off choosing a chain restaurant with average or bad food and paying at least half as much."}
{"text":"So I've been to bucca about 10 times in my 21 years of existence but I only come back for the food. Somehow the service is terrible all the way from San Diego CA to Arizona. Anyway; last night me and my boyfriend came in for dinner for his birthday. It was slow and it took us 10 minutes to get seated(which happens every time we are here.) The hostess seemed stressed out and clearly did not want to help us lol. She asked us if we wanted a table or large booth so we just chose the booth because it was offered. When we sat down it was clear she was annoyed that we chose the larger booth. She tossed us our menus and told us our server would be right with us. Our server Jenevieve also seemed stressed out and we felt very un welcomed. While ordering she would cut us off and wouldn't let us finish the name of the entree/'appetizer we were getting, which was rude. When she brought the bread and oil&vinegar, she placed our plate of oil as far away from us as possible, behind the table tent that was on our table. (I can't make this stuff up). Anyway, our food came out in a timely manner, however it wasn't until I mentioned we would be having dessert for his birthday, that she turned her attitude around. She suddenly put a smile on her face, (which I'm guessing was because us ordering dessert was the cherry on top of her tab), and was so cheery and pleasant. I love this damn food but we hate dealing with the shitty service. Oh- this is also from 2 people who work in food, and me being a manager in the industry myself. Get your sh*t together."}
{"text":"Major tourist trap! BEWARE the wine list. Carafe cortino tomato tomato let's call the whole thing off!! Never again & oh by the way I live here!!"}
{"text":"First, on a positive note, our server Ashley was great! She was very warm and inviting, and prompt with our order. My group tried the caprese, antipasto salad, sprouts with prosciutto, and rigatoni. The caprese was the only memorable part of the meal, unfortunately. Antipasto salad was bland, and the parmesan cheese offerings were from a shaker on the table. The sprouts tasted unseasoned and even the prosciutto flavor was underwhelming. My rigatoni had very little marinara sauce, which meant that it had very little flavor-a but like eating plain pasta with a few teaspoons of sauce. It was slightly embarrassing because I brought out of town guests for dinner and we all felt the same about the food. Our beverages also didn't taste as though they had any alcohol at all.

The service was great though! I will go elsewhere for my Italian in the future."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch with my friend this afternoon and we were blown away at how well prepared the food was. I ordered the chicken parmigiana, which came with a side of spaghetti marinara. I usually don't care for spaghetti but it was prepared so nicely that I finished the entire serving that was given lol. With that being said, I was so full that I couldn't get through more than a few bites of the actual chicken parm, so I took it to go. I just now reheated it in the microwave though and it tastes just as good as it did when it was served fresh, so this place gets a thumbs up from me and I will definitely be visiting again. Our waiter, Sean, was also really helpful and provided wonderful service (you da real MVP Sean!!). 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food here. Consistent, spaghetti with king sized meatballs is fantastic. Garlic bread with cheese is really good, pepperoni pizza is delicious. Thin pizza, pepperoni is plentiful, just great pizza. Wait staff is friendly, nice experience."}
{"text":"Came here with a large party. The meal was memorable but not Ina good way. We told the waiter in advance we needed to split the bill and they said that's fine. There were about 35 of us and they are supposedly known for their ability to handle big groups. Unfortunately our food and drinks came out completely haphazardly. Some people had their entire meal while others hadn't even gotten their drinks. It seemed like the people who ordered last got their order first. Some people's food was forgotten. The bills were all wrong. And the food was only so-so. Oh well."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious food. Food is a 5. My only complaint is handicap accessibility. I went to dinner with my grandma and the servers seated us down a flight of stairs on the other side of the building and my grandma was exhausted."}
{"text":"The worst thing about this restaurant is that it looks so darn dirty.  I don't mind all the pictures and knick-knacks, but please clean up the place.  The bathroom is hotter than heck, which, to me, is unacceptable in the summertime.  You can hear everyone's conversation next to you, there was no music playing, and the light fixture above our table had burnt out lightbulbs, so we could hardly see.  The waitress was way too chatty with us, and complained the whole time about the kitchen staff; very unprofessional.  On the plus side, we thought the food was excellent, fresh and plentiful.  Unfortunately, a return trip is not on the horizon."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here. It was a lot of food for the two of us, but it was so good!! We walked it off on the strip! lol~"}
{"text":"We went with a large group and needed to be in and out, without delay. That for the most part was good. We called for in advance, because it was a Saturday night and I suggested.  There was a wait list at door, our group was seated quickly ahead of those. 
Food was OK. Not Steller or anything great.
Chicken parm was mah.. don't think they use real mozzarella. They could have used more and fired it up for a second in a salamander.  Chicken seems as its advance cooked. Fettuccine  Alfredo was bland and not very cheesy, it was all stuck together and undercooked. It's chain Italian for the masses.
Family style Olive Garden. The server was pretty attentive. Some delay between food and desert.  When we left, place was pretty empty and most tables were left with dirty dishes,  there must be a bus boy strike."}
{"text":"We went here for a big family dinner and I was very disappointed.  It's a nice concept but the food was lacking. The garlic broccoli was more like garlic sprinkled with pieces of broccoli - so much garlic we could barely eat it! And we love garlic!  Some of the food was cold and it was just overall .. very low average.  Not great for the price.  The kids thought the Pope table was kooky and fun but that's not what we paid $150+ for... I doubt we'll eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here for family dinner the portions are huge and that can be a plus if you want to just split the dishes. It was not busy but our food seemed to take a while. Didn't bother me since I felt that was because it was being made fresh. I order the eggplant Parmesan which came out burnt and cold. I sent it back and it took over 20 minutes for them to remake the order. My family was already done with their meals and we needed to get to an event so i had to ask a different waiter the status of my order which finally came. Felt like the flavor could have been better but all in all it was good the second time around! I believe in 2nd chances so I would try the place again."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo is my go-to place if I'm going with people that are indecisive about their meal.  Since everything is family-style, I can just get a few entrees that everyone can share.  Service at this location is friendly, and it is easy to get a reservation through Opentable.com.  There is enough variety that even the pickiest eaters will find something good.  The mood is pretty festive every time we go, and everyone meets and greets you with a smile.  My favorite item here so far is the linguine frutti di mare.  It comes with a flavorful tomato sauce and is packed with various seafood, which makes it a good deal for the price.

Last time I went it was in celebration of my mother's birthday, who likes to have the waiters sing to her on her birthday.  I mentioned that it was my mother's birthday in the comments section of the Opentable reservation site, and I mentioned it to the waitress right before ordering our dessert (No free dessert for birthdays, but they do sing for you, she said), but no one ever came to sing for her.  We felt a little disappointed, but the tiramisu dessert we did have was rich, creamy, and quite tasty."}
{"text":"Coupons. Bring them. If you live in Chandler or Gilbert you should get them in the mail. If you don't then Google it. They can save you $10. That being said with a coupon this place is cheap for what you get. The portions are Small or Large. Don't get it twisted, small is not small. It is regular size for a average sized person.  I've never left hungry. Not to mention they stuff you with FREE bread before you food comes which is delicious.  Once the food comes out it is usually very hot and it always delicious. Yes, the service can sometimes be a little slow, but usually not for me because I am friends with a few people that have now served me many times. Treat people right and they will want to do the same for you.  Everyone is usually very friendly. This is one of my favorite places out there. I have never been disappointed yet. I can't think of any areas for opportunity so for that it must be 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is ok as expected. The service here is poor. We had to wait 30 minutes for water and bread. Extremely pretentious for a Vegas hotel diner where you expect hospitality to be number 1 on the priority list. The buffet next door is a much better option and for a party of 12 was about 80 bucks less."}
{"text":"I will go easy on them cause without knowing we went on the first day they opened this location. I should say I have been to Buca before so I know how everything should taste. 

First off the food took forever. Again, it was their first day so they were really on their trial run. We got spaghetti bolognese and pepperoni pizza. The pizza was fantastic. It was loaded with pepperoni just like I love. It could have been a little more done but that is my fault for not asking. The pasta tasted as it was supposed to but it was luke warm. I could have sent it back but it took so long to get it I didn't want to wait. My wife had a craving for garlic bread so we just ordered it without checking the price. It came as chunks of break with very little butter or garlic flavor. We thought \"oh well\" until we got the check and it was $11 for a basket. That was very disappointing. There is no garlic bread in any restaurant in the United States that is worth $11. It's bread, butter and garlic. I can make it better at home for $3-$4.

All in all they have some improving to do. I wish them good luck."}
{"text":"Saturday at 6pm. Hostess lied about the wait time, said it'd be 10-15m and was actually almost 45m. Finally seated. No water, no bread until the salad came. Had to ask for silverware. Took literally an hour for the entrees to arrive. Brought incorrect entree. Nearby dirty tables w items strewn about the floor not bussed for 20-30m. Worst service I've encountered at any establishment in decades. Food was adequate, but all the pasta dishes taste the same. No point going back."}
{"text":"Great team dinner at Buca Las Vegas! The sales department worked with us to design a menu and space that worked for our team of 17 year old boys and parents in town for soccer. Everyone had a great time and enjoyed the food. It was also nice that the price was pre-determined, including tax and tip."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out and the staff went above and beyond! The host named Dany was great about helping me with my complicated order! Thanks to the management for making my favorite: linguini white clam sauce!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. We had a reservation for a large party (16) for lunch. Besides 4 other people, we were the only ones in the entire restaurant for lunch. It took 50 minutes to get our meals!!!  On top of that, while we were waiting, we had to ask for refills on drinks. Inexcusable. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I eat here on every visit! The food is excellent ((evertime)) and consistent! Service 10!! I never eat at the Brea or Claremont locations. The Vegas location is THE BEST! The ones in Cali are no Bueno!"}
{"text":"Food and service are not good.

Not much else to say but it was just bad all around.  Our food order wasn't correct, the follow-up to resolve it was terrible, and the food when it came was overcooked and bland.  Instead of serving good food they just hope to win you over by shoving a ton of bad food in front of you."}
{"text":"Great place and close to MLB spring training facility for the SD Padres. The service was good and Dustin was great. The food was more than plentiful and fresh. The ambience is cool and lots of stuff to look at while eating."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and it felt like being part of a family and not to mention the dinner was delicious. This is such an amazing establishment and I would recommend everyone to go check it out. The stuffed shells were amazing!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the service was very poor. It took about 10 minutes for someone to notice us and order our drinks. Thankfully the manager was around and he took care of our order even before our waitress came. Buca's idea is to be able to share your meal with your familia! The problem I see with this is that for just 2 people is hard to decide on one plate. However, I'm sure the concept works great for big groups. The food is good but is nothing that I would be craving. I would still recommend the apple gorgonzola salad which was great!"}
{"text":"For some reason, lunch this afternoon felt like quite a rush - or more like, service felt like it was rushed and that isn't exactly a compliment. I'm usually a big fan of Buca Di Beppo - foodwise, count me in - but when the overall dining experience isn't up to par with what is expected, I am forced to lower down the rating a notch. 

My parents and I came here a late Mother's Day lunch and ordered a small chicken carbonara, small calamari as well as the garlic pepper broccoli. Our waiter had great sales talk about items on the menu, however, at some point, he started to feel a little pushy. When we weren't even done with our dishes, he came up and asked if we wanted a box for our carbonara of if we wanted it taken away already, when there were still some calamari left on the plate, he took it away without asking...and my parents and I were left staring at each other in uncomfortable silence as he walked away. 

Other than that, the food was awesome. Carbonara filled us up to the brim, we didn't have room for dessert although that tiramisu sample our waiter showed us looked prettttyyyyy tasty. I also highly appreciate the photo service with complimentary postcards per table - with optional bigger photos for about $5 if I remember well. Music was really chill and the atmosphere didn't feel as intimate as the Paradise branch. So that's a 3/5, nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Buca is the type of restaurant you go to only to say you've gone. Their pizza is ok but the atmosphere is fun. If you like garlic then you're in heaven. If you don't like garlic then life will suck for you during this meal. This might be exclusive to pizza and cheese bread, perhaps their other entrees aren't out to kill Dracula."}
{"text":"Never know what to expect at any Buca at any time. Went in at lunch and had a beer and a large salad. Salad was OK as expected, Paulo the server was great !! He was training a new employee and never missed a beat. $20 for $10 Living Social got us in there. Get the deal and visit....."}
{"text":"Did an online reservation for our group for our daughter's graduation. Checked on the day of the dinner to confirm it - so far so good. We should up a little early and were shown to our table right away (we were a party of 12). Since I knew this was family style dining, ordered a large calamari, 2 large salads (antipasti and ceasar) along with baked ziti, pepperoni pizza and chicken. Salads came out OK. When we got our entre plates, half of them were dirty (you could see grease marks in the light and when running your hand over the plate, you could feel dried crusty things on it). After pointing this out to our waiter (who never bothered to introduce himself), he took our plates away to get new ones. In the meantime, we watched another server check the remaining dinner plates on their shelf by running her bare hand over all the plates. I don't know about you, but I was a little turned off by that. We were then given salad plates (guess all the dinner size plates had to be cleaned). Our main entres arrived without further incident. Another server who helped bring out the food asked if we would care for some red peppers - which we replied with \"yes, that would be great\". Red peppers never arrived. Same server (female) asked if we wanted more bread, which we replied with \"yes, we would like more bread\". She took our bread basket and disappeared - never to return! If you don't intend to bring anything back to our table, why do you ask? Upon paying our bill, we thought our server would return....nope! He disappeared also! We left disappointed with the service! Why would we spend so much money only to be ignored? It's not like the restaurant was packed with a waiting line. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I always loved this place in Chicago! Tried to go today for a late lunch - sat down at the bar; the sign says they open at 11:30 - it's 3:30! My date goes into the kitchen to find someone - oh someone will be right there... we wait, we wait... finally we leave and go across the street to RnR! Too bad!! I really wanted their chopped salad and meatballs!!"}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo is a great place to go for a family dinner.  The dishes are all served \"family style\", made for sharing.  I went here with my extended family for Papa's birthday--total bill for 20 people, most of whom were kids, came to just over $200, which is not cheap, but we ordered a lot of food. My personal favorite was the chicken limone.  Lemony deliciousness."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this place. I got Katie as a server and she was super nice, engaging and very knowledgeable about the menu. Because I work in hospitality, I always look at the type of service I receive. I believe that makes or breaks the overall experience regardless of how well the food is prepared. I'll definitely come back. The food was good too. Lol."}
{"text":"As an out of towner just trying to enjoy a holiday with my family, I found it quite entertaining that they chose to come here when we could have gone to a Buca di Beppo back home... but my family is not adventurous and knew that they were serving a \"traditional holiday menu.\"

When we got here, they sat us immediately at a large table and I'm sure because of our reservations they already knew what to expect. A big, loud, Italian mixed family. 

They started off with a huge bottle of wine, and then the food started pouring onto the table (benefits of advance notice of what we would be ordering). I still felt bad for our server though because we can be quite demanding, though he seemed to take it in stride.

The meal was delicious, we had a fine mixture of traditional holiday foods as well as a few of our Italian classics. My only real complaint was that I ate too much and felt very uncomfortable. 
Why then you ask am I giving it only four stars? The food WAS delicious, and the service was impeccable, but you could still tell it was a national chain restaurant, and you could still tell that the servers didn't want to be there working on the holiday.

Would I come back? Maybe, but I will head to one closer to home."}
{"text":"The chicken Marsala was the best we'd ever had.  Loved the pasta too.  Service was excellent.  Only thing needed is better decor and serious remodeling in the ladies room."}
{"text":"They were very busy when we went and we sat at the bar to get a seat quicker.  We ordered spaghetti with meatballs and chicken alfredo which we split them between the two of us.  The bar tender was very efficient and helpful.  He always keep us in drinks and he saw that we didn't want to buy big giant meals so he gave us suggestions on how to get a good sampling without spending a bunch and throwing away 1/2 of the food.  If I'm in the area, I'll stop by again."}
{"text":"UPDATE: The franchisee of this location reached out to correct the issue and seemed genuinely apologetic. I have updated the rating from 1 to 3 stars in reflection of this, as it seems that management does not want this to occur again.

ORIGINAL DETAILS:

Booked through OpenTable to get the points. Arrived at the restaurant and explicitly asked the host to check in my reservation so I could get the points, despite his eagerness to seat me right away because the place was not busy at all. He played with the screen for a bit and acted like he checked me in, apparently lying right to my face: I got an e-mail from OpenTable two hours later indicating that I never showed for my reservation. Not only does this mean I did not earn any points for dining at Buca di Beppo, but it also puts a red mark on my OpenTable account for allegedly not making it to a reservation.

I've raised the matter with OpenTable, but know that right out of the gate that the employees at this location would are more interested in being dishonest about something that probably costs them a 50 cent commission than actually serving up a halfway-decent dining experience. No wonder they're broke and give out coupons like they're going out of style."}
{"text":"we went to this restaraunt the a couple of months ago and it the service was absolutely terrible. I can totally understand being busy and all but nothing excuses how we were treated. Our drinks sat at the bar for a half an hour before they were given to us. Our server was too casual, I don't mind someone with some confidence, but don't talk to me like we've been friends for years: \"sup guys?\" Also, he didn't have his own pen, my friend had to give him one of ours and he totally forgot to put in one of the entrees we ordered. When we called it to his attentuon, he acted like I was lying. He literally said, \"I think you guys are lying.\" He didn't even apologize or anything. We had to wait forever for everything, drinks, meals, dessert and check. Food was so-so, atmosphere was loud and cramped. For families with young kids, it might be ok, but I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time, or money. This place is mediocre at best. The atmosphere is great, especially for large parties. They are very accommodating for something like that. However the food is not that great, I would recommend Olive Garden over Bucca any day."}
{"text":"Excellent service on a Friday night. Kevin took care of all our needs and helped us celebrate my daughter's birthday. Pizza was great. Peroni is cold."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had to ask for bread to start the meal when normally they bring it out without hesitation. Then later refills on water never came. The main entree ordered was burnt when the restaurant was no even busy so there was extra waiting time to wait for the entree to be ready again. When the entree was finally done it came out burnt still on the noodles. Finally when it came to the check it was about 15 to 20 minutes before we left to pay and leave. We were the only table the waitress had and she decided to prepare drinks behind the bar before giving us the check and a box for our food. So she asked another server to get the check for us. When I put my card in the billfold we had to wait for the other server to process the payment while the waitress was still making drinks. It was very poor service and I was very disappointed and confused why she put drinks before servicing her only table. Her name was Cindy and if you ever have her as your waitress there I feel sorry for you. So bottom line I do not recommend this location to go dine at. One of the managers even asked our waitress if she knew how to make a certain drink and she responded yes. Why would the manager ask her that if she was the one responsible and hired as the bartender and should know all the main drinks that need to be served. I don't plan on coming back to this location any time soon. Likely never again."}
{"text":"So this past Friday I held a birthday dinner for my mother here. I chose this place because I had quite a nice time when my company held the holiday party here. Things quickly got off to a bad start. I reserved the Pope Room 2 weeks in advance, called twice and also drove to the restaurant twice within that two weeks, yet when we arrived we were seated at two tables elsewhere. Initially I reserved for a party of 10. After learning my mother wanted her coworkers to be in attendance I called back to reserve for \"up to 18.\" 

I told our server the seating mix up and she went to get a manager, who came back basically to tell me I was a liar. I tried to explain I made the reservation 2 weeks ago and I came back the day before to pay in advance (at which point the manager I then spoke with told me that wouldn't be necessary b/c unless they'd hold card info they don't do advance payment), but before I could finish she smirked & replied \"No you didn't because we don't accept advance payment.\" This did not go over well with me, or the party she said this in front of. I told her do not cut me off and she put her hand on me. I yelled don't touch me & tried to finish what I was sayin but she cut me off AGAIN and went to get Eric (the manager I spoke with about menu options the day before). He explained that once I said our party could have reached 18 people, the option for the Pope Room automatically is removed in their system. The staff would not know I had once asked for that room.

If it was not for Eric and the servers we had I'd give this place 1 star and a BBB complaint because that woman who came out arrived with nothing but conflict in mind. That was a great showcase of poor management; Eric shouldn't be there doing damage control for another manager's behavior. The servers were tipped handsomely for their awesome service & upbeat personalities, although they were quite timid after the explosion between guest and management. However, I will NEVER return to this place."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed. Food were great... but lack service. Not asking for 5 star service or anything, but it would of been nice to check and refill the water."}
{"text":"First off, our server Dustin, was absolutely the top of the line.  Attentive, warm, friendly, professional and a great wine guy.  My wife is very selective and drinks only non-acidic Chard. Dustin recommended she try two tastes and recommended one which she loved AND it was the less expensive of the two. Food portion(small) was huge.  ALso, DO NOT miss the garlic mozzarella bread!! Just don't fill up on it before your meal arrives. We are not big eaters so we have enough left for another couple good meals.  We asked Dustin for some special treatment on the garlic and olive oil sauce and he nailed it (or rather he made sure the kitchen did.)  This is a nice unpretentious place and we will be back.  Entire staff was friendly and attentive.  Smiles all around, including us."}
{"text":"At the southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue stands a colossal castle called the Excalibur. Inside the castle there is an Italian restaurant that serves portions of food fit for a king. 

   It was Christmas Day when I toured the Christmas decorated hotels and public areas of the Strip from Mandalay Bay to Fashion Show. As I was walking through the Excalibur, I spotted Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant. The red colors caught my eye. I decided to look at the menu. The hostess let fall that if you are dining alone that you can have the lunch special all day long. A few hours later, I would return to the Castle to enjoy food portions that would make me feel like a king. 

   This Buca di Beppo is one of several in a chain of Italian restaurants that are owned by Planet Hollywood. Currently there are around 95 of them. Buca di Beppo has risen to fame with their outrageous portions of delicious Italian food that are called a la carte or family style. These portions are meant to be shared. But what if you love Italian food and are on a solo dining adventure? Buca di Beppo serves individual size entrees that are the lunch special. In the case of the solo diner, the lunch special could be ordered at 5 pm or 9 pm. 

   Obviously a restaurant serving king sized portions of tasty Italian food is sure to attract a lot of diners. The upshot is there was a short wait. Time went fast while waiting on a bench overlooking the menazene level of the castle. Ironically Buca di Beppo means Joe's basement in Italian. A few minutes later, they called my name. 

    Buca di Beppo does a nice job with the decor. Despite the fact that this is a chain, , it felt like I was dining in a family-owned Italian restaurant. 

   I walked in here decided on ordering eggplant parmigiano with spaghetti (lunch price $12.99) and a Pepsi ($3.29). As expected the portion was humongous. Who needs a buffet with portions this big. The left side of the plate held eggplant parmigiano topped with marinara sauce, Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and mozzarella cheese. The right side held spaghetti with marinara sauce. I exchanged over $17 with Buca di Beppo for a meal that was both quantity and quality. After finishing all this food, I walked out of the castle feeling like the king."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to go for family style, good food.  I've been here countless times with my family and big groups of friends.  Last night, my friend and I stopped in to grab some dinner after a long day.  We split the apple Gorgonzola small salad with the small spaghetti & meatballs.  I had a glass of their Malbec to go with mine.  
I love going here whenever I'm really hungry because I know I'll leave very satisfied.  The aroma of garlic being sautéed as you walk in grabs you and puts you into a comfort zone.  Speaking of comfort zones, the dishes they serve up here are real comfort food to me.  No fancy new takes on good solid recipes- just real ingredients done right and fresh.  
They use the San Marzano tomatoes which  makes their sauce so full of flavor, rich and less acidic.  The fact that they keep their sauce simple and use great ingredients really makes their dishes enjoyable.  They're tasty but not too busy with any unnecessary extra flavors in the way.  
What keeps me coming back here is the fact that I've always had a very nice meal here; the value to cost, the fun atmosphere, and definitely that wonderful savory smell as you first walk in."}
{"text":"We found this place wandering around looking for lunch.  The decor is a bit cheesy, including a Pope room with a domed roof.  The menu if \"family style\" (aka, everything is super big).  We ordered one appetizer and one entree to share, and couldn't finish everything.  Eggplant parmesan was very good.  Food presentation was average.  Service was average.  Prices seemed a bit high."}
{"text":"I wish after having gone to the bathroom and seen a table in the kitchen that I had eaten there, that was something I haven't seen before. The food was good, not great, very big portions and an overall fun experience. Went with a buddy, I think this would be more fun to bring your family to and do the family style experience. I ordered the ziti, and it came out  piping hot, which aside from the burnt lips, was good. What disappointed me was the caprese, it was really bland tasting. Overall though a place I think you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Pesto chicken sandwich pretty good as were the fries. 
The service,  however, at lunch time on a weekday?  Not so much. Pleasant, just slow."}
{"text":"We had my birthday dinner here this past weekend. The Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken seemed smaller than the locations in Mesa and Chandler and also was a bit dry and burnt tasting. Our salad was very good. The garlic mashed potatoes were not garlic at all and was delivered as the rosemary potatoes, once again a smaller portions from the other locations. Our waitress was very kind and provided excellent service. The birthday song was fun, update and very cute. We were a bit disappointed in the food, knowing the fact that it could be so much better and has been at the other locations."}
{"text":"Well we were the only ones at 11 when they open. Slow service and food was alright nothing fancy at all. The part I thought was a little weird was we recieved a plate of oil but not bread... my garlic breads garlic was so bitter it was nasty and the pasta was pretty good but nothing too fancy that would make me drive back for. Our pear salad had like italian dressing on it was weird expecting something way diffrent maybe it was me misreading but wouldn't think those two would even go together... oh well used a gift card. Definitely better places in the area choose wisely... lol"}
{"text":"Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. Our waitress Alexa sucked long story short. Kinda boring/monotoned. Forgot our drinks. Never refilled our waters. Took forever to bring us our check and change back. It was kinda busy so i'll cut her some slack. Food made up for it though!!! Food is always delicious. Definitely will come back, hopefully with a different server!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the appeal of this place. Sure, the portions are huge, but the food is generic and bland. The spaghetti and meatballs were the worst I've had. The sauce was liquidy and flavorless. And even though the portions are huge, the prices range from around $17-26 a plate. No thanks, not worth it."}
{"text":"While visiting Scottsdale with my wife for the weekend we were looking for a good Italian place and figured why not throw a dart at a wall? So we chose Buca, not realizing it is a popular chain famous for serving family size portions. Since it was just the two of us, we only ordered one dish - a chicken cantelloni made with spinach and a rose sauce. It was a quality choice. We also enjoyed mozzarella garlic bread which was in my opinion, the best part.

Only downfall to this place would be the slow service we experienced and the delay in getting us seated and waited on. Wouldn't recommend this place for a group of 2 or 3. Certainly better suited for larger groups."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a favorite of mine for several years. Dine-in or a catering event the food quality and consistency is always at the highest level. Although this place is a chain, the experience is hometown. Vodka sauce, Penne San Remo, Chicken Saltimbocca rival any great Italian restaurant. Michael Graham treats you like you are at his home as a guest. They are catering my son's graduation party this Saturday. They are sending one of their servers to serve my guest so we can enjoy the party. We are lucky to have this place in Westlake."}
{"text":"BS ++

MI FAMIGLIA!!! This place is home.  It's a great Italian restaurant with roots.  This place is homey and is in the heart of the Strip (off Flamingo).  The salads are good.  The pizza are fresh.  The pasta - MAMA MIA!!! This place is so good.  But what I love the most is the birthday song! I wish I remember the lyrics.  But I would bring anyone here and pull a prank just to hear them sing that song.  I highly recommend the Brussel sprouts with the prosciutto.  BOMB!  The server is super friendly and you can ask for endless soda!

{"text":"It's been more than three years since my original review of Buca, so I figured it's time to write again.

Though we still like Buca, and the experience is one that you should really check out if you haven't already, I'm not sure that I'd suggest you do so as heartily as I did before.

For starters, the plates of food seem to have found their way to Dr. Evil's shrinking ray.  It's not uncommon these days for portions to shrink, but for whatever reason - perhaps because Buca already had large prices to begin with - the difference just seems to be much more pronounced.  We still love the shtick, but it's a bit harder to swallow is all.

When it comes to value, it's not there as much as it used to be.  The flavors haven't changed, and they seem to have put a lot of money into a fancy new menu to get you to buy into their plan, rather than the relatively simple menu that they used to have.  The servers even seem to be working on the hard-sell now, rather than the simple family style that used to work so well.  It just isn't the same."}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed our last visit but this one will probably be our last. 

Our waitress was polite and energetic but lacked in serving us.  She initially brought out our drinks but never asked us if we wanted refills. I had asked if she would bring me another drink when my entree came but I had to remind her. She only came back once to ask if everything was ok. The restaurant wasn't very busy. We watched her provide excellent service to the table in front of us. I don't know if she didn't want to provide that same experience for us because we had a $20 off coupon. Honestly you need some kind of discount because the food is overpriced. Regardless of whether I have a discount or not I tip off of the regular price. Her tip would have been better if she would have given the same service she gave others. I was happy that the manager stopped by the table to ask if everything was alright. At that time we didn't have any complaints. 

I've often wondered why there haven't been any updates to the restaurant. It's very outdated."}
{"text":"Restaurant is interesting yet confusing. I got lost going back from the bathroom. Lasagna is out of this world. Never ending layers and it seriously melts in your mouth. Enough for two people! We also for a side of meatball. Very huge and delicious! Bread is good too."}
{"text":"I've been to several Buca di Beppo restaurants in Maryland before coming to this one. Each time, I've become less impressed with their food. Yes, they serve massive portions, intending to follow their mission of serving family-style meals and thus contributing to the obesity epidemic in the United States. However, the quality of their food is mediocre at best. As the saying goes, \"Quality over quantity (unless the quantity of your meal is the size of a golf ball).\"

So, my friend and I came here for lunch. It was the middle of the week, so we did not expect there to be too much going on. We entered the restaurant and told the hostess that we'd like a table for two. To our surprise, she said there would be a 15-minute wait. I looked around and there were quite a few empty booths. I thought maybe they were short-staffed...but my friend and I decided to look at the menu while we waited. There was another group who came in after us who had made reservations, so they were promptly led to their seats. I started thinking maybe we should have made reservations, but the hostess interrupted my train of thought by telling us that our table is ready. She led us to the third floor, past several empty booths and tables, and showed us to our booth.

Before ordering our food, we had use the restroom. Inside the men's restroom, we discovered a number of very interesting pictures. Of children. Showing their naked butts.

...

So after a good laugh, we made it to our booth and perused the menu. My being a vegetarian, and my friend wanting to do everything he can to accommodate me, we took a bit longer than expected to decide what to order. Our waitress came by two or three times to ask if we decided. I felt so sorry for her because we kept being hesitant and making last minute changes, especially after realizing that pasta does NOT come with the eggplant parmigiana (honestly, who doesn't eat _____ parmigiana WITHOUT pasta?!). Eventually, we decided on the food. I ordered a white sangria and a large Pizza con Formaggio; my friend ordered the eggplant parmigiana with an extra side order of spaghetti marinara.

After 5 minutes, my white sangria came, which was very good! About 10 minutes later, our pizza came. Our waitress placed the pizza board on top of two \"pizza cans\" that serve to elevate the pizza to make room for the eggplant parmigiana and the spaghetti marinara. After attempting to slice the pizza, we banished the pizza cans to the side of the table and laid the pizza board on the table, which made it a lot easier to cut and serve.

The pizza was cheesy, saucy, and good. I felt it didn't have much flavor besides the cheese and tomato sauce. I did my best to search for the \"garlic-infused oil\" flavor that the menu clearly stated, but my tongue could not detect it.

The eggplant parmigiana was okay. There was more fried batter and cheese than eggplant, however. I felt like I was chewing into a thick and slightly wet cheesy tempura. I looked inside and found the thinnest slice of eggplant ever. I thought the eggplant was supposed to be the star of a dish called eggplant parmigiana...?

Overall, the highlight of my meal was the white sangria (not that I'm an alcoholic, mind you). The food was not authentic, the portion sizes were a bit much (I'm sure some people may like that), and the quality of the food was mediocre at best. If you're looking to gorge yourself on Americanized Italian food, this is the place to go! If you want to treat yourself to an authentic Italian meal, steer clear of this chain restaurant. While I haven't been to many Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, I know there are places that serve authentic Italian cuisine somewhere in the city."}
{"text":"I used Buca di Beppo for a corporate marketing luncheon.  The restaurant failed to provide me with plates, utensils, or serving spoons. They also shorted me on my order of bread and failed to slice the bread that they did provide. Those that did get bread were forced to tear pieces of bread off of the main loaf with their hands because it was not sliced. The manager was dismissive of our complaints and failed to appropriately make up for their mistake. I will never use them again!  Go with Cafe Rio, a little more expensive, but much better customer service."}
{"text":"Compared to the locations on the strip the Summerlin location is extremely disappointing. After being seated next to an extremely loud and drunk party of fifteen people (three tables put together) it took over ten minutes to be greeted and another five to get our drinks. The wait staff had no enthusiasm or pleasantry and honestly after like we were a bother being there. 

My girlfriend had booked us a reservation for my birthday and both left disappointed. We'll never step foot in this location again."}
{"text":"It's been a really long time since I've dined at Buca di Beppo since it hasn't been on my agenda, however, my fiancé's company decided to have their holiday party here. There were 20 people in our group and we had one of their sections equipped with five booths and a long table. The space we were given was rather small and the booths were very uncomfortable. The cushions gave way that you could feel the reinforcements under the seating and there was very little room between the table and benches. It was also difficult to interact with anyone other than those at your booth, so it defeated the purpose of having a large group space (the area is not intended for a gathering of that sort). Service was pretty good, but not spectacular. My fiancé's boss had to constantly flag down the server to refill beverages, so I even suggested to leave the pitchers (the server didn't do that though and we continued the refill game throughout the evening).

Apparently there was bread, but none made it to our table, so I didn't have the opportunity to try it. So, our meal began with Bruschetta. The bruschetta itself was pretty tasty and it was served on a large garlic bread loaf, which also had good flavor. However, it was extremely difficult to eat since the slices were enormous and the bread was challenging to cut with butter knives. I've never seen bread slices served that large, with or without something on top of it. Our next appetizer was the Chopped Antipasto Salad with pepperoni, red onions, pepperoncini, cucumbers, Roma tomatoes, kalamata and green olives, provolone, feta, Gorgonzola, and lettuce in their signature Italian vinaigrette. This was good. A bit heavy on the dressing, but otherwise really great combination of ingredients.

For our entrees, we had Fettuccine Alfredo, Spaghetti with Meat Sauce, and Chicken Marsala. I tried just a bite of the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was fine; it's not something I would ever order since it's much too boring. The Spaghetti was unsurprisingly overcooked and the meat sauce was all right. Still, the most eatable dish. The Chicken Marsala was blah. Chicken breast was overcooked (dry) and the sauce was too sweet and tasted too much of wine, in a bad way. It was a good thing I wasn't hungry or I would have been pretty cranky. 

Dessert was Tiramisu and Double Dark Chocolate Cake. I went straight for the tiramisu since it is one of my favorite desserts, but alas, I was disappointed. The dark rum soak was overpowering and the harmonious flavors of espresso, cocoa, and Mascarpone were mangled. The chocolate cake earned a shrug.

Needless to say, I didn't enjoy dinner very much. I mean, the best item was the salad. Positive notes: I like the family-style dining, their decor is fun, and with a better seating situation, I think it's a great atmosphere for a family/friends gathering."}
{"text":"Terrible! 

First I order the veal and it gets to my house (yes I did uber eats/always do and never a problem) and there is no pasta! Wtf! 

Next came hours later. The veal did look greasy and not good. I ate it regardless. That's when it all went bad

I've never been on my toilet more in my life. 


I'll never go back. Thanks Buca!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food was ok. I asked for no onions and my pizza still had onions in it. My waitress said, \"she tried to remove as many onions as she could but its mixed with the peppers so...\" When I say no onions I mean no onions. You could have told me before finishing my pizza that onions are mixed with peppers and i would have said fine no onions or peppers. Also the menu is set up so the \"small\"(not small and i have no idea why they are called that lol) is meant to feed 2-3 the larges. Well my wife and I wanted to try diff things but the \"smalls\" were all around $20 plus and were are in a hotel(not trying to deal with tons of leftovers) so we end up sharing a pizza and my wife didn't like it. I woulda gladly paid for a couple $15 plates considering the quality of food and service here. The menu setup is wack and everything else was ok...."}
{"text":"Food of course was excellent. Hostess not personable, we had 2 waiters but they never communicated to each other so we needed to ask twice for any thing."}
{"text":"Went here after an event for a banquet of about 40 people. Was a little hesitant of the $20/person charge, but whatever. We were there for the experience and the food. 

Our 4-course meal consisted of bread, cheese pizza, spaghetti in meat sauce, and gelato. We were all pretty hungry but as we were scarfing down the food, noted that it was good, but not $20/plate excellent. The service was really good though and I'd probably come again with a smaller party."}
{"text":"The bf and I had plans for July 3rd in Ahwatukee but since the entire city was out to watch the fireworks, our plans got squashed and we decided to just grab dinner and call it a night. There wasn't a wait at buca and we were seated in their wine room. I hadn't been there in a couple of years and the bf had never been so we made some rookie mistakes. We started with an order of calamari which was really good. We decided to get two small entrees (main mistake). He had the spicy sausage with ziti dish and I had the stuffed shells. I wish our server had emphasized how big the servings are because they are giant. The two small entrees could have easily served at least four - so it is best to share a small entree if it's just two people. The two entrees were good, nothing spectacular but good. the service was good and the dinner was overall a good experience, I probably won't be back anytime soon though."}
{"text":"First time here. Having the Linguine Frutti di Mare. Scrimp, Baby Clams, Mussels and Calamari in Spicy Rosa Sauce. That's just the beginning!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Atmosphere was cool. Service wasn't the best.  Kind of felt like they hustled us.  After we ordered our waiter asked us if we wanted bread sticks and salad made it seem like it came with what we ordered. Didn't ask what size we wanted. Just brought it out.  Then when the check came out we were charged for a large garlic bread and large salad.  Which was 30 additional to what we ordered. Other then being hustled food was a little bland.  Baked zete was over baked. Made it really dry. Shrimp Florentine needed salt. Most likely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I came to this place with a great mind set. I had heard so many good things, but wow was I wrong. The whole place is filthy. My spaghetti was as cold as Antarctica and my server was as equally terrible. She happened to spill the whole water pitcher on my lap. I would like to say the food made up for the inconvenient service, nut every bite made me hate the place even more. 
When I first walked in it has a weird setup. You must walk through the kitchen to get to your table. That is a bit odd but nothing that would make me dislike it. The people there were nice accept my waitress. She had quite the attitude. Once again that does not mean that the whole place is terrible nor the food.
Like I said I gave it chances, but they fell through in every category. The food was cold with no flavor. It was a real annoyance and definitely makes me never want to go back to this place again. This was a waste of time and money and gets two thumbs down."}
{"text":"This place is terrible,I went for my birthday on the 29th and the candle they gave me to blow out had a lot of candle wax on it. They couldn't even clean off the wax."}
{"text":"One evening after having dinner with my family

{"text":"Pros:
- Obscene amount of food for the price you pay
- Good garlic bread

Cons:
- Feels less authentic than Olive Garden if that's even possible
- Kitschy decorations
- The waitress asked my coworker if I'm over 21. Why didn't she ask me? Did she think I needed a translator because I can't speak English? Or did she think I'm so young that my only response would've been goo goo ga ga pppllllffttttt?"}
{"text":"Went here on 5/11/2018, and was served by Jarrett. Had an amazing time as always. Great waiter and great food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Met with friends we haven't seen in 6 years. Stayed for 3 1/2 hrs! Our server was great from beginning to end. Michael T. was our server. Lots of patience. :-)

This place is very well managed. Everyone was very friendly. Manager even thanked us for coming in and opened our door. Very nice.
Food was good too. Lots of it! Ordered family platters. 
Great experience."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about this place as I don't have kids, so I didn't need the family sizes, but I had a great experience at this restaurant.
The employees were soooo nice.  I mean genuinely nice.  Our waiter gave us a lot of really helpful hints and great service and this made our meal much more enjoyable.  I can't speak for all of the restaurants, but this one was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Eh...this place is okay. I've been to other locations that seem better than this one. Food is so-so, staff is friendly enough, and the atmosphere is fun but it's never been my first choice for Italian when in Chandler."}
{"text":"I went here recently for a group event. I chose this location as they had a private room for a decent sized group which is hard to come by in Old Town (without having to spend over $200). When I arrived, I was disappointed that it wasn't really a private room. I was hoping for something with four walls as it was for a business type meeting where we don't want strangers overhearing our conversations.

The service was very friendly and great. The food was also good too. The large portions says that they feed 4 people, but it definitely feeds way more than that. We had so much leftovers where everyone could take some food home."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Took my wife and son here on Sunday night and the food and service is top notch. I felt like I was back home in New York. The linguine with mussels, shrimp, clams and calamari was the bomb. I finished the rest 2 hours after I got home. The waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"A little cost-prohibitive for the budget conscious, I will concede to that. But that's the price to pay if you want Italian food that is, in my opinion, the best Italian food chain. Forget the OG, that place is terrible. The pastas and the salads at Buca di Beppo are delicious! The dishes at Buca are served family-style, so one order can serve anywhere from 2-4 people, depending on how hungry your crowd is."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this location, but I was disappointed with the service. The servers were not friendly. The server looked at us then choose to help the other table first even tho we had been there first.I work at a near by hotel and I will not recommend this location. The food was ok I could not enjoy it because I was so upset with how uninterested the server was in their guest."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally go back to Buca for pizza. However our experience was well below par. The bread was cold and actually wet! The huge disappointment came when the pizza arrived. Toppings were sparse; it was not visually appealing and tasted bland."}
{"text":"Big big portions.... Plan on taking food home with you! The food is pretty good, I like the spicy ziti dish. I didn't care for the fettuccine alfredo sauce it was bland. But the fresh baked bread was nice and the garlic bread with cheese is a must have. Go with a group and share or plan on taking home left overs!"}
{"text":"People that go to places like Olive Garden and Buca, then complain about chain restaurants crack me up. It's like going to the DMV and expecting not to wait in line. You know what you're getting before you get there. Wise up. 

Buca is fun for a chain. Their eggplant parm rocks, as does their cesar salad. Four stars because you get to walk through the kitchen when you come in and they bring a wine bottle with the menu, I love not having to wait for wine. 

If you are looking for real home made Italian go to Giuseppe's. But if chain suits your fancy Buca is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I have to give Buca di Beppo props on the ambiance they create.  You cannot find another restaurant like it (or if there is one - I am not aware of it).  

For those that are not familiar with Buca di Beppo, it is an Italian restaurant that serves family style meals.  Any dish you order is meant to be split between members of your party - so if you have a party of 2-4, you really only need to order 1-2 dishes for the party.  Me, being the picky eater that I am, I would rather order my own dish than share.  

At least with this experience, did not have the best server.  He did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job.  He was willing to split the bill among the five people in our party, but one person in our group ordered an alcoholic beverage and the price of her drink was split amongst the people in our party.  

They might only do this if there are people in your party that have not eaten at Buca di Beppo, but when they take you to your table, they walk you through the kitchen (which has a table for patrons to eat their meals at).   The only plus side of going here for meals."}
{"text":"The food is decent, however one of our dishes came to the table fairly cold. The other two dishes were nice and hot. The server was horrible. She simply stood there and asked if we were ready yet. No suggestions, even when asked. The sangria tasted like koolaid, and the bar drinks were so weak and watered down that my drink was sent back and I couldn't even drink the final version. I just gave up. It was a two ingredient drink, not something complicated. Anyway, I had a person who appeared to be the manager argue with me about my drink. I will not be going back and will tell my friends not to bother.  Oh, and the server had to add our bill up twice and it took at least 20 minutes to charge us. We could see her from our table and she was truly clueless as to how to put the amount on the cards."}
{"text":"We went in on a Sunday evening for a huge business dinner. We probably had 15-20 people. All of the staff was very helpful. The food was good and the cheesecake was to die for! But one server in particular stood out. Christina was helping us during the dinner and afterwards when a few of us stayed at the bar. She was fun, friendly and Knowledgeable!!! She was very attentive and made us feel at home. Often when receiving service in a restaurant you will feel like the server is only there to do their job (because that's all that is required) but Christina went above and beyond and made us feel like she enjoyed being there and that our company was not only welcome but appreciated! We will come back just for Christina!!

P.S. I think the staff should get to wear costumes on Halloween because they are awesome and it would be fun!!"}
{"text":"I stand corrected. When I'm wrong, I'm wrong. For the record, it doesn't happen often, but when it does, I usually admit it. I have to say I was completely wrong about Buca di Beppo.
I'm thankful that I'm a person of second chances. If I wasn't the person I am, I would miss out on some of the finer things this world has to offer. One of those things being, one of my new favorite Italian Spots.
I decided to give this place another chance. My friend and I arrived at 5pm, just like last time. As we entered, the hostess was standing at the podium and she had the nerve to be smiling. It's been a long time since I've been anywhere where someone greeted me with a smile. Oh but she did! She was also very perky and attentive too. I like that! Make me feel like you're happy to see me lol.
We were seated promptly, and once the hostess walked away, the server, Ken, came right over. He was pretty cool. He took our drink orders and brought them back fast, along with the \"free\" bread and the oil and vinegar mixture that I remember ol so well, from our last visit. He then asked if we were ready to order. We were in fact ready, so we proceed to do so.
We started with the mozzarella garlic bread and Baked Rigatoni. It sounded like a beautiful combination. To be honest, I were skeptical. I was just hoping whatever we ordered, tasted better than the Fettuccine, from last time. I also was going to get into a fight with the cooks if I paid $10.99 for a cheesy-garlicky brick, and I didn't want to go to jail over food. Joking!
We reluctantly started on the \"free\" bread. Surprisingly, it was soft and tasted nothing like the boot they served us last time. It was actually good.
Meanwhile, Ken, came back with a salad for the table next to us. Being greedy, I called him over and inquired about it. He gave me a few details and ran to get the menu, so that I can look at all of them. He brought the menu back and pointed out and described EVERY SINGLE SALAD. Ken showed me more attention than my last date did. 
So we decided to order the $14 Caesar salad. I don't know if Ken had anything to do with that or the fact that we were extremely hungry. Either way, he put it in and came back with it after about 6 or 7 minutes, a little after he dropped off our Garlic bread.
Speaking of Garlic bread, I'll probably never have any bread that will be as good as it was. It came with about 15, perfectly cooked, pieces. It had the perfect crunch around the edges and the softest and moistest cheese in the middle. Can someone say worth every darn penny! It was just delicious.
We almost forgot all about the salad that was sitting there all scrumptious looking. We scooped out some of it and it was really good too. It was well worth the money.
Around that time, Lorenzo, the manager came around. He's a really nice guy. We chatted about my experience and I was honest with him about everything. He subsequently, apologized about the last visit. I could tell that he was really passionate about his job. I was delighted to let him know that EVERYTHING we had just tasted was perfect. 
Lorenzo asked what entrée we ordered. I told him it was the Rigatoni. He told me that the Rigatoni is really good but his favorite is the Quadro el Forno, which was $20. It actually sound really good. Being me, I wanted to make sure that we experienced all of the best recipes that they had to offer. We ordered that one as well.
Ken brought out both entrées fast. I have to tell you, they both looked delicious. We looked like we had enough food to feed a clan of pregnant women. We took a couple scoop of both. My friend and I both just looked at each other. The food was nothing like we've had in a long time. It was just impeccable.
We liked everything about the Quadro el Forno dish. The cheese was perfect, all of the pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce had the perfect spice. It was excellent.
We enjoyed the Baked Rigatoni too, but the pasta seemed to have been cooked al dente. I like soft pasta, myself, but my friend thought it was perfect.
We ate maybe 1/3 of both pastas and then Ken brought a \"To Go\" container, and we packed the rest. I have to say, for the record, we ate it for the next 2 days. It was just as good heated.
Lastly, Lorenzo came back around and made sure everything was ok, which everything was awesome. He recommended, along with Ken, that we try a dessert. We were damn near stuffed to complicity, but we did want something sweet plus everything looked so good.
We ordered the Colossal Brownie Sundae. Our face dropped when we saw that thing come out. It was bigger than any dessert I've ever seen. It had to be for a whole family. We maybe ate a fourth of it a packed it up. It was magnificent though. The brownie was warm and soft and ice cream just complimented the cake to the fullest extent. It lasted 3 days, after that day.
In all, the experience was 100 times better that the first visit and the food was 200 times better. We'll definitely go back, maybe even today!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our first anniversary here, and we sat at a Kitchen Table. Interacting with the staff was great, they we're all fun and friendly. The food was delicious; we ordered fried mozzarella, chicken Saltimbocca, and Fettuccine Alfredo, and it all tasted amazing, especially the house bread!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had my rehearsal dinner for my wedding here back in October.  We had scheduled the room for 30 people on a busy Friday night.  My party got held up and showed up late.  The management was very understanding and polite (though they were losing money every minute our party ran late) .  The Food was hot and fresh and the service was exceptional.  I would suggest BDB for dinner or any small to midsize group function."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Service was excellent.  Bring a lot of family members.  A lot of food to eat and then take home.  You have to try everything.  Stuff shells were superb."}
{"text":"Great waitress but horrible food... I love Italian but this falls short of 'true Italian '. The decor of the place is a mixture of a bad TGI Fridays crossed with a veteran of foreign war hall with elements of a crumbling prison. If you eat in the bar area, bring an umbrella as the plaster from the ceiling is falling down, exposing a huge hole in which a few roof rats can make their way in or plaster will end in your food.  Seriously, avoid this place at all cost...there are way too many nice places in walking distance from here."}
{"text":"Went here for my girlfriends birthday tonight. We had a party of 11 and no reservation, and they sat us in 5 minutes. The food was the best we've had in a long time!! From appetizers, pasta and dessert, everything was fantastic. We had Jarrett as our sever, and he made the entire night of orders a breeze. Our drinks were never empty. This place was perfect for a large party celebrating a birthday, I highly recommend. Ask for Jarrett if you want 5 star service."}
{"text":"These guys are extremely S L O W.  They open up at 11 am.  I got here at 10:55. There was party of three a head of me. They open the door. We came inside. We waited and waited and waited. Finally the waitress on us for our name and they will be calling us out on a short while. (Keep in mind I was the second customer of the day)

Five minutes later - she seated me. And I waited Again. Eventually the guy show up with bread and oil and vinegar on the plate. He took my order. 

So I wait and wait. Now they brought out the spaghetti. It literally smell like canned of tomatoes opened up. When I look it the sauce it look like canned of crushed tomatoes on top of the pasta. When I stir the sauce with the pasta. All the tomatoe juice and went to the bottom chuck of tomatoes was laying on top. They don't give you spoons. All they give you is fork and a knife. 


The bread is good but they give you very hard butter. Not good to spread bread. Salad is also extra

For an individual- it is not the place for you. They serve big portions so share with whole party. Prices are ridicules high."}
{"text":"Food is great....on the pricy side but I think its worth it. The service is just so so."}
{"text":"Went on Xmas Day. Had a reservation and was whisked in to a table. The female waiter we had took about 10 minutes to get our water and drink orders while another table of 6 with a kid were seated  after us and got their water, drinks and appetizers before us. Our server was switched without any explanation to us, and our food then came out in a timely manner. Everything was tasty, from the Caprese salad, Stuffed Mushrooms, to the Short Ribs, Chicken Saltimbocca, and Stuffed Chicken Prosciutto. Was disappointed they didn't have the ingredients for my first cocktail choice ( The House cocktail Buca Bella) but the Italian margarita was tasty but a little light on alcohol. I'd love to come back on a day that was not as noisy and demanding  and Xmas Day.
Caprese Salad: A- (Tomato was a little soft)
Stuffed Mushrooms: B 
Short Ribs: A
Stuffed Chicken Prosciutto: B
Chicken Saltimbocca: A+ (I even attempted the recipe at home!)"}
{"text":"My sister took my husband and I here to eat on my last day in Vegas. Sooooooo good! I've never seen my husband eat so much before. Food was so flavorful and customer service was good!"}
{"text":"Buca Di Beppo is definitely one of our favorite chain resteraunts.  The food always tastes more home cooked.  We love this particular location.  The service is always fantastic.  We continue to come back!"}
{"text":"For 6+ months I'd had a reservation for my son's rehearsal dinner at their first-date restaurant, Buca in Station Square. I only wish someone had told me they were overbooked for the night. We were a party of 40 put into a room for 30, with a separate area with 2 additional booths, not what I had expected and not a good way to \"Blend families\" . We were also told there were 2 other rehearsal dinners that evening, which I'm assuming is why even though we were 20 minutes late for our reservation, it took another 30 min to get settled; we needed additional chairs, waited for salads & bread & champagne for a toast. For this 30 minutes we had 1 server for 40 people. Also, the temp inside was about 90 degrees, no lie. The 2 infants were down to only diapers in an attempt to cool them off. The staff told us they are not allowed to fan themselves to playoff the burning temp. You could see the sweat on the brow of many.  Our reservation was for 730. Around 820 we started to receive bread, etc. At 830 finally additional servers were able to jump in; I'm guessing one of the other dinners had ended by this point. Once we got the additional servers, the food & service was excellent. However, as the host it is very stressful to watch 40 people waiting for food and receiving the wrong drink orders if getting ANY at all. When I addressed each issue with the manger, first the dissatisfaction with the space and then at the end of the night the delay in service, she disagreed and almost argued with me. She gave me NO discount or satisfaction not that anything could have saved the night. We finished @ 1020pm, A bit late for the night b4 a wedding. I was so aggravated after planning this for months. I highly encourage you to consider other venues for your party.  Just not a good value; POOR MANAGEMENT!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at 2 locations of this restaurant. The one was in Huntington Beach and I have forgotten the other one. But my point is that they serve really good Italian food. If you are on a carb-load program, hut thus place up!"}
{"text":"My family and I came in to have dinner last night and we were seated right next to a table full of happy, loud teens. And my 4 month old grandson, not being used to loud noises, wouldn't stop crying. So I asked the management if they can move us somewhere else. And they did! With a happy smile too! They have an awesome, wonderful staff! I will certainly be dining in more often!"}
{"text":"Seriously Good Meatballs!

I'm so happy I've discovered this place.
Good home style pasta, meatballs, marinara souce.
Good quality home bread and butter (you supposed to eat pasta with bread and butter)
Good service, if they busy it might take a bit longer to get your food, but it's worth it!

Tip: they will let you use items from their Lunch Menu if you show up all by yourself even at 10pm.

Tip #2
Better bring a friend or two, as all their menu items are designed for 2 or more people!"}
{"text":"I have definitely had WAAAY better Italian, but if you're going for quantity vs quality - this is your place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie pizza. $20.00 for a sparsely covered pie. There were about five pieces of each veg. On the whole pie. It was also barely cooked, not crispy at all. I paid for extra cheese and ,wow, if that was extra ,the regular amount would be scant.  This has given me a bad impression and think the place is overpriced and not real concerned with quality"}
{"text":"I really love this chain of Italian dining and try to drop in on occasion.  The food quality is pretty good, service was always prompt and the location clean.

My only complaint is they give you TOO much food.  I find even the lunch portions to be a bit much to eat in one sitting."}
{"text":"As I have said in my previous review, this place is fine when serving a small group (less than 4). So I was somewhat afraid that my cousin chose this place to have his wedding reception. I just prayed and hope that there will be no repeat of the experience I had at this place.

Over 50+ people attended the reception and the place was packed! It was funny that there were 3 other groups of newlyweds celebrating. To cut a long story short. Everything came out great! The servers were clockwork and very attentive and the food was good. No complaints at all and everything went smooth as butter."}
{"text":"Check out the sanitation score when you go there.... 86% as of May 11,2017
Service was horrible... the hostess sat people that walked in before us and we had a reservation. Well I guess it was a blessing bc while we waited I noticed the sanitation score. 
We walked out . Plus the last couple of times the service and food are not great."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very generous portions and the best waiter on the planet. Jarrett is outstanding and made the night fun for all. A great place to bring the family for a night out."}
{"text":"Just came here for Mothers Day pickup for catering. They blew the entire order. They asked me if I could wait 30 minutes while they fixed the order.

I cancelled it. I am going to cook burgers. Forget these clowns on a holiday. It is a sure fire disaster."}
{"text":"The place is overcrowded with kitschy things on the walls and in every corner. We also noticed all the flowers outside were fake and pretty worn out, which made the place look ridiculous, cheap, and unkempt. So for environment, we would rate it a 2 star.We placed our order online, which was convenient, but when we showed up to pick up our food the place was dead and we couldn't find anyone to help us. Two employees actually made eye contact with us and then went right back to talking and slacking off. After about 10 minutes, someone did finally wander up front to get us our order. 

We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, Penne San Remo, stuffed shells, and chocolate chip cannolis. The meal came with french bread but the bread was stale and cold. The mushrooms weren't too bad. The sauce was tasty but the stuffing overpowered the mushrooms so it ended up tasting like sharp cheese and sauce. The penne san remo is supposed to contain artichoke but we only found two chunks of artichoke out of a container with enough food to feed 3 people. So that was disappointing. The sauce was also really bland and the chicken was overcooked/rubbery. The stuffed shells were ok, no major issues, they just weren't worth the price. Actually, none of the food we got was worth the price. We paid over 60 dollars for a dinner that was maybe worth 30. All in all we weren't impressed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"This was a first for me.  We were with a wedding party and the menu was set.  it appeared to be a family style meal with 3 courses and many items were brought out, some I have no idea what they were since I rarely eat Italian.  My favorite was chicken saltimboca, wow.  a lemon sauce was on this along with prosciutto, who doesn't like prosciutto, am I right?  The service was great even with such a large party we were all attended to very well."}
{"text":"Can here with a party of 20. Were seated fairly quickly and ordered family style meals. Service was average, food was good however we felt crammed in a room which we shared with 40 other people. Price is on a point. Will return"}
{"text":"I have been to various locations before and really enjoy the food. However, I decided to go to the flamingo location tonight for my birthday dinner with the family and my experience was total trash. First we walked in with a reservation and our table wasn't even ready. We only waited about 6 minutes so it wasn't a big deal. We get seated and it is going good until I realize we have been seated for a little over 10 minutes with no greeting or anything. Finally someone comes over and says, \"Has your server been to your table yet.?\" Then our server comes over and while we are waiting for a couple people to arrive we try to order drinks and an appetizer. Our drinks didn't come to the table for about 10 more minutes and they came one at a time. Finally our whole party is complete and we are all kind of just hanging out.... have yet to see our server come around again. When she does she stands at one end of the table and takes the whole tables order from one person which is fine. But instead of letting us know we probably ordered too much food for our party size, considering the portions are huge, she acted like it was going to be just enough food for us. We wait about an hour and 10 minutes in total before our food finally comes out and we are super disappointed at this point. They didn't even pre bus our table to make room for our dinner plates. So while they were putting them down we were literally handing them empty appetizer plates and dirty napkins and silverware. We never received more napkins or silverware either. The side of mashed potatoes was literally cold, like the butter didn't even melt on them, and they tasted like they were scraped out of a TV dinner. Our side of garlic mozzarella bread is nowhere to be seen. Chicken is a little dry and way too buttery not quite enough lemon. We all have empty drink glasses majority of our time and until I track down our server and let her know there are multiple issues with the table she didn't even check back. I let her know and she takes the mashed potatoes, brings back the same exact dish of them and says they are hot now. I didn't come out to eat to have microwaved mashed potatoes. Still haven't received water or soda refills. And at the end of our dinner the small amount of staff they still have on comes to sing to me for my birthday. At the end of the song I blow out the candle and the server asks if I want the birthday cheesecake, kind of implying that it is maybe a free dessert. I say no and someone at my table says yes. It ended up being on our check. A $12.99 piece of \"birthday cheesecake\" that I said no to when she asked. Odd. Anyways. We are looking at the check and we ordered the spaghetti with meatballs but after we ordered it she comes back and says they are out of the \"homemade\" meatballs. And they can do the meat sauce instead. For some reason we are still charged for the meat balls which is only a 5 dollar difference but still. I bring it to her attention and she has to adjust the bill. In the end I will say I am NEVER going back to this location again. Clearly they need new management and more staff because they had no idea how to run a restaurant in there. If I could give this place 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo is pretty darn good for a chain in my opinion. The Westlake location is my favorite in this area. 

Buca has a great atmosphere. The restaurant has an interesting set up. There are little nooks and crannies to sit in and there isn't an ounce of wall space that isn't covered in some sort of knick-knack, painting or photograph. There is always something to look at, but it can be a bit overwhelming to the individual with ADHD. My favorite room to sit in at Buca is the Pope Room. Basically the Pope room has one huge round table with a Lazy Susan in the middle of it. In the middle of the table sits a case with a bust of the pope. This room is great for parties with families and friends. 

The best way to order at Buca is to get a variety of dishes and and share. Each dish come in small and large so don't expect to need to order one small dish per person.  I have never had a bad meal at Buca. For being a chain I feel the food is pretty good quality and tasty!

My boyfriend is on a gluten-free diet. Surprisingly, Buca has a dedicated Gluten Free menu. It is actually pretty extensive. The wait staff always seems pretty knowledgeable on this menu. Just mention to the hostess that you need to order off the this menu and they will bring one out to the table. Finding a good restaurant with a decent gluten-free menu can be very difficult when eating out. Buca is a breath of fresh air!!!

I would definitely recommend Buca di Beppo to anyone who likes Italian!"}
{"text":"WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!

I came here with my husband and my 2 yr old son last night (4/2/15) for my birthday and it was the worst experience I have ever had. First, we had to wait for a seat for about 20 minutes (at 8:00 PM). It seemed that we were being avoided. We then get seated and immediately place our food order along with our drinks. There was a large birthday group across from us but I figured since we were just ordering spaghetti that we wouldn't have to wait an extremely long amount of time. As we wait and completely understand that there is a large group ahead of us, we ended up sitting there waiting for just SPAGHETTI for 30 minutes. Then the manager comes over and said, \"oh we made a mistake on your order and it will be ready in about 10 minutes. ANOTHER 10 MINUTES FOR SPAGHETTI. We ended up just leaving without our food. And with an extremely hungry 2 yr old. There was no \"hey let me give you a voucher for next time or hey I'm really sorry about that\", nothing. I will never go to this restaurant every again and will never suggest it to another person. 

This actually happened at the location on Val Vista about a month ago as well. Horrible service."}
{"text":"To me the food is spectacular here.......like nothing is subpar or seems like they skimped on it. Nothing feels out of a can or frozen junk it all seems pretty high end. Its a different type of restaurant because you get served in \"family style\", what this means is whatever you order is portioned for multiple people. It's a great place to go in groups. It's a little pricey compared to some other chain restaurants but remember #1 it's in a very nice area and #2 you're paying for large portions intended for multiple people (and most likely taking alot home) #3 it's high end food. The staff is very nice/attentive (especially the girls) i usually try to tip at least $15 just on my own."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place only has three stars. Jarrett was a great waiter. Fantastic and very very attentive. We don't eat out a lot but because of his service I'll make sure we come here more often. Thank you Jarrett!!"}
{"text":"Oh, so tacky and cliche. That's what makes Buca di Beppo so great. From the Christmas-light-wrapped statues outside to photos of nuns running through the ocean inside, everything gaudy and over-the-top about Italian-American culture is embodied in the restaurant.

The experience starts with the escort to your table, which takes a detour through the kitchen (where there is also a booth table. In the kitchen.) and around by the Pope Room used for large parties (with a creepy wax bust on a rotating dais in the middle of the table).

Food is served family style. A \"small\" plate will feed 2 to 3 people. Everything is very tasty - I personally love the baked pasta dishes, the garlic bread, and their salads can be a meal by themselves, too. Not a place you want to come unless you are feeling hungry.

My only complaint is that their only Charlotte location is in Pineville and rather tough to get to for me. But when I'm in the area, a great place to stop!"}
{"text":"If you love giant entees and eating family style then this is your restaurant.  The decor is cooky and fun!  A fantastic date would be to eat at the table in the kitchen!  The kids would also like the \"kitchen\" table if you can get the reservation!"}
{"text":"The three of us had lunch today. Started with the fried mozzarella which was great. The main course we ordered the small lasagna, the taste was good but it was cold in the middle. But the service was good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. We go to Bucca's for anniversaries,birthdays and just because. We always order the spaghetti because it reminds me of my mama's. I love the food, the decor and the service."}
{"text":"I really should have known better-being that I was spoiled in NJ with such fantastic italian food.
Once again, another restaurant (chain or family owned) that does not offer chicken francaise! What do I have to do to find some chicken francaise in AZ?!
Anyway..food was bland-you have to order pasta seperately? really??? It's not included? what italian place doesn't give you a smidge of pasta? Even olive garden gives you some pasta!
Oh well..server was great, so I gave the extra star for the super waiter and I actually love all the kitchy stuff on the walls."}
{"text":"Only my second time in and only went because of the birthday coupon. I guess it isn't really a savings when  you don't eat what you ordered. Bartender/server welcomed the two of us and handed menus. My wifes menu had marinara sauce all over on the inside. She pointed it out to server and she retrieved it and said she would bring another. By the  time she actually brought another menu she had grabbed the one off the top of the stack and yep, you guessed it, same old filthy menu! So we pointed it out again, server took the menu and we ordered. During our meal my wife went to grab a menu to identify what was what on the plate (ordered some stuffed pasta with 4 different items). She gets back to the table and guess what? Same freakin menu just put back on the pile. No one even attempted to clean or leave behind the bar this nasty menu. I suppose that is why my feet stuck to the floor under our table. I'll look forward to their up coming equipment auction due to closing. So many choices at Arrowhead you just wonder?"}
{"text":"Our family had decided to go to this Buca di Beppo for a graduation party because we have always loved the food. Previously before the date of the meal we had reserved a party room and the day before, and of the meal we had called the restaurant and checked in on our reservation and they said it was all set, but upon arriving they had put us in different tables and given someone else our party room. Usually this would be no problem but most of the food at Buca di Beppo is family style and the tables they put us in were split apart, we managed with this set up but that is not why I'm am rating us low it is because of the manager. When we got to the restaurant they said our table is not available so we requested to see the manager. The manager named Marie just did not care at all about our concern that our table had been taken, she didn't even try to help us get another table set up that was all the employees. Marie, the manager did not take anything off of our check or try to do anything to help us. So if you are looking to eat at Buca di Beppo do not go to the arrowhead location, or try to find a day when Marie is not there."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with Buca!!  While it is far from fine dining it is also a solid choice!  I have never had a bad meal at Buca.  I like their Salads and bread.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Marsala!  They use their own Marsala and I have yet to find a better one.  The portions are huge and you will always leave with lunch for the next day.  Their Tiramisu is one of my all time favorite desserts!!  You can't go there without ordering it!  Unfortunately they also petiodically have retired some of their very best dishes.  R.I.P. Prosciutto Rollatto and Sambuca Chocolate Sauce!!"}
{"text":"Dined in Monday night, Hosts were awesome! Food was amazing and the manager was great! Will definitely be coming back soon! Thank you for such a great experience."}
{"text":"we came here for a birthday dinner with several other large parties in the room they seated us in.  The wait was incredibly long, it took two plus hours to eat!  The wait would not have been so bad if the food was worth it but it was very mediocre.  The salads were the best part of the dinner.  We don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good lunch!  Good fresh food, excellent service so I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing is that by the time you pay for each little individual thing, I think the value of the family dinners at Maggiano's far exceed the value here.  I will return again for lunch but would do family dinners at Maggiano's for sure.

We split a Garlic Bread with cheese, had two drinks and split the Quattro something plate (one Cannelloni, One Manicotti, two shells and some ravioli) and the check with a $10 off $20 was still about thirty bucks with tip."}
{"text":"Good Italian food, and great waitress.  Large party but got good service anyway.  Bread would be better served warm.  Restaurant needs a face lift, though.  Everything is worn and the hand drawn undies on the Greek lady rears was very tacky to look at my entire meal.  And all the booth seats were ripped.  I'd be more inclined to go back if it wasn't so run down.  But the food and service was decent."}
{"text":"Portions are not as large as advertised. Two of us ate the most of large lasagna which is supposed to feed up to 5 people. I was never able to complete a regular pasta portion in other Italian restaurants.

Atmosphere is nice, with all the lights and framed pictures."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but not great.  It is a little on the bland side, but still very edible.  The portions are gigantic, if you don't have 5 or more people eating the same dish, get the small size.  The service was very good on this visit, though we were the only people in the place on a Tuesday afternoon."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for my first time the other day and I definitely enjoyed it. The portion sizes are quite large, so you can share with other members of your party. We ordered 3 dishes: the lasagna, a salad, and chicken. We were all fully satisfied with what was ordered and I would definitely come here again. Their happy hour is also a plus."}
{"text":"So I have allowed some time for my last experience to digest and feel i can write an objective review.  I and my family have for 3 years gone to this restaurant for Thanksgiving.  Each year we have made a reservation in advance by at least one week.  Each year we have had to wait to be seated at least 20 minutes after are reserved time.  (Last year was 35 minutes)  As i sat and watched the front I noticed that people without a reservation were giving the exact same wait time as people that made reservation.  This is unacceptable, why would you take reservations if you are not going to honor the agreement and seat the people on time.  Why would you make someone that took the time and gave to courtesy of calling ahead wait as long as someone that did not bother.  Either accept reservations and make non-reservation wait longer or do not accept them and have everyone wait the same.

After we got seated we ordered drinks and an appetizer.  They brought me the wrong drink and after waiting 35 minutes brought the wrong appetizer.  Then the food arrived within two minutes of the appetizer (which we had returned for correction).  When they did bring us the correct appetizer it had almost no cheese on it and was luke-warm.  

Overall the experience is not something we are planning to repeat.  So we have 1 year to find a new Thanksgiving location."}
{"text":"It's no Joe Mama's, but it is an interesting place to eat, especially in the case that you're going with a large crowd. The restaurant itself is an eclectic looking maze, I spent 10 minutes trying to find the bathroom. The food comes in options of small or large, large feeding up to 5, small up to 3. The food is good but not great, and the meatballs are the size of my fist. Online you can occasionally find coupons for $20 off with no minimum you have to spend, so I would suggest that if you're looking to go."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a nice dinner with friends and family.food was great, service was awesome, and they give u large quantities! We finished off our meal with a brownie sundae, huuuuge!! Enough for four! I will definately be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying the food was amazing,  haven't eaten  here in years and I don't remember the food being that good but man was I wrong. For a chain style restaurant it was as good as good gets ( by no means great but a solid good ). We had the baked ziti and it was like my mom made it covered in nicely baked delicious cheese. 

So you might be thinking  why did I only give it 3 stars? Well the waitress was not pleasant at all , the overall atmosphere is up beat and she was a drag. I find it interesting that in such a family fun atmosphere someone  so dull could work there ( not sure if that was the right there , or is it their ). It's a shame I feel like she kinda kept stomping on our tables mood. 

Well to recap food good server we had mood killer. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Here for a wedding reception dinner and it was amazing. Our server Joe was very attentive. I'm full, satisfied, and sleepy from the carb load. Great food, great family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The service wasn't the best.  We had a party of 8, our table was ready when we got there- definitely make reservations for anymore than 4.  The restaurant was very clean, but since it is in the Excalibur, there was no restroom inside the restaurant, you have to go out to where the buffet is.  Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and large family style portions, my favorite is the veal parmesan. Been here numerous times and they get really busy, not always the best service and is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"David the general manager was a complete gentleman with excellent service!  5 stars on customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big fan of Italian food. I come here for the atmosphere/décor. And because I like their Spaghetti and meatballs, yum! It's a bit pricey, but hey what Italian restaurant isn't? You'll definitely dig the look, and the food. The servers are friendly, the food is good. When you get there, they walk you thru the kitchen, like old timey mobsters lol. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"I'm a pasta lover, and this restaurant always hits the spot! Well-trained, happy employees. Eye-catching all-consuming interior decorating. Great for families and/or friends to catch up, or for dates. My favorite!

Tip: Make a reservation or come early, this place can often get a little busy on weekend nights."}
{"text":"The stuffed mushroom is THE BOMB! So good, that pesto sauce. We also ordered the Shrimp Florentine was also good. Their small size serving is good enough for 3 to 4 people already. And that Tequila Sunrise, gave me a little buzz. Very satisfied, everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"We had an event here with 40 family members and it was perfect. When arranging for the event, the cooks made special arrangements for a few family members with dietary needs. Those two individuals felt particularly well cared for and appreciated the extra effort to avoid gluten and dairy. The staff was very efficient, replacing bread, drinks and salads as needed. Everyone was impressed with the food and service. I would definitely recommend this location for large events."}
{"text":"Yuck. The food is basic non- exciting Italian and very bland. My big problem was the ambience...dusty dried flowers and picture frames...filthy carpet, and DO NOT use the restroom."}
{"text":"The ambiance of buca di beppo is quirky and fun. The food was good - not the most amazing Italian food but it was fine for the price. We shared a vegetable pasta dish and started with garlic bread. The garlic bread was ok (even better the next day when heated up at home).  The chocolate gelato was a nice end to the meal - though again not the best I've had. This would be a fun place to go with a large group - especially since the meals are mostly made family style for sharing. Our waiter was great."}
{"text":"We ordered take out through postmates today for dinner and I was very disappointed. The veal was disgusting, it had a horrible after taste and was really tough to chew. The chicken parm was ok not great. The brownie Sunday was a huge let down too. They were a bunch of frozen brownies with ice cream. I don't recommend anyone go here. It was overpriced dog food!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. The decor is plain and boring. The service is acceptable. Not the worst Italian food I ever had, but pretty close. Tried a variety of food from here. Everything was extremely tasteless. Seafood was not fresh. I left hungry.

If you don't mind low quality Italian food and want something fairly inexpensive with acceptable service, it might be an acceptable restaurant. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it even if you're already at Excalibur. 

Food 0/5
Service 3.5/5
Decor 1/5
Value 1/5"}
{"text":"We had the popes table. 14 people. I know thats alot. Server was not feeling well,no issue with that but.... service was slow, very slow. We had to start to clean off the table. The kid was flying solo, no one helped him. It also was my childs b-day. We got the big sundae thing which was tasty  The downside , the brownie bites in there could have broken a tooth. Still frozen. They sang the b-day song , fine. No issues. But the manager barged in swooped up the still dripping candles off the table ,saying there are lots of birthdays today. What, do they only have one set? And, the candles were about 1/2inch big. Do they have a candle shortage. Not well organized.
Food was tasty.

Update: Person from company reached out to me. I suppose it seem like my post reached some ears. Submitted my email and ph# to her . Still waiting for her to contact me. 1/19/18


UPDATE TO UPDATE: STILL NO WORD  FROM THIS MYSTERY WOMAN. Begining to think she does not exist. 1/25/18


3rd UPDATE: STILL NO  CALL OR EMAIL , 1/31/18
4th update2/5/18, nada."}
{"text":"I had dined here the last time I visited, but this visit was for my wedding dinner reception. What an outstanding job they did. We only had one waitress wait on a table of 12. She did a fantastic job. 

Our original reservation was for 7:30, but the ceremony was over earlier than I anticipated. I called and was able to get it changed to 6:30. We were about 15 minutes late, but were seated immediately when we got there.

As soon as we were seated, the drinks and the food just kept on coming out. We had a set menu done ahead of time and were served immediately. I love that the food is family style. We had so much food and it was all so good. We were bummed that we couldn't take it with us. But none of our hotel rooms had microwaves.

The manager was great and so were all the staff. I love this place for family occasions. I will gladly be back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Food was fine, except the salad, but the front of house staff did a mediocre job at best... won't return."}
{"text":"My wife and I got stuck in Excalibur when it was downpouring outside and choose this restaurant out of the few food options there are in the building. We mainly made the decision to go there because we wanted a quality pizza that would hold us over till dinner. They serve large helpings of food in all their dishes.  Having had some of the best authentic Italian pizzas in both the US and from Europe, the quality was basically in my opinion the same as your local supermarkets frozen brands. Based on the taste and price, it was overall a 2 star experience."}
{"text":"If you come here, you better come here hungry.  This is a great Italian place.  You gotta come here with friends and family to make it worth while.  All of the plates are set up family style, so be ready to share... just like at mamma house!

Our college's Italian Club came here for a night on the town.  The place was very accommodating.  We got a private room and a few servers to make sure our experience was as good as it could be.  The service was pretty good for a party of 18 on a busy Saturday night.  The waitress actually mistakenly gave us extra platters of cheesecake, but believe me we did not mind.

The food was delicious.  Chicken Parmesan was my favorite, but the meatballs were a pretty close second.  Bread with oil and salads made a great antipasta for us.  All of the pastas the place made for us were pretty good too.  I mean nothing compares to my mom and grandma's, but the food was pretty good.  Like I said, the chicken  parmesan and meatballs were really good.

The waitresses brought us some cheesecake for dessert.  Ehhhh it was alright.  We did not get to choose our desserts individually.  If we did, I probably would have went for the cannoli, but hey, the cheesecake wasnt too terrible.  My suggestion is try something else on the dessert menu.

All in all it was a great time.  One of the best atmospheres to eat dinner at if you have a big group.  So, if you are looking for a place to celebrate something with a group of people or you just wanna go indulge in massive amounts of food, come to Buca."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the service,  lots of quantity but lacks quality,  everything was very bland and the Chicken Marsala was so sweet i thought i was eating sweet n sour chicken at an asian restaurant.  for $20+ a plate i've had much better."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Italian restaurant. 
It's a very loud place and I felt was too busy for me to even pay attention to one thing. There was too much going on that day. There was wedding parties, big families, birthdays, and so on. 
I was on a date and felt that it was way too loud and crazy for a nice \"getting to know each other\" type of date. So, I'd avoid this place if that's what you're going for. 

The ambiance was everywhere. Reminded me of an Italian version of TGIF. Yanno, random things on the wall and every waiter and waitress running around everywhere. Also, singing the happy birthday song to every table.

As for the food.... the waitress suggested we should order carefully as the food are all family style large portions. There's 2 girls on a date with one another, we weren't going to eat that much. I'm not a fan that they were all large portions though. I wanted to try other things on the menu, but I wasn't going to order it if they're all family portions. SO, we ordered the lasagna and some garlic bread. 

It was a HUGE portion! There was a lot of garlic bread too! The food tasted a little bland for my liking. I felt the sauce wasn't giving me anything. I had to put a lot of parmesan on it to taste anything. The garlic bread wasn't too bad though. I liked it. At the end, we both didn't even finish our food. We took it to go. All in all, the experience was only well worth it because the waitress was very kind and always checked on us. Food wise, eh. So-so."}
{"text":"If you like the whole ala cart type places, this place is for you. One option to split for $30 and doesn't come with any sides not even bread for the table. Food was meh for how expensive everything was. Won't ever be back, Rice and company at the Luxor is a million times better with way better prices."}
{"text":"Okay maybe it was an off night or this is just a bad location. I was not pleased with the service, and our group were the only ones in the place. It was after 8:00pm maybe they were trying to close up. 

Food was not cooked well  (cold) and the orders cam out wrong. The appetizer never made it to the table.

I've been to another Buca and had a fabulous experience so give them a try, hopefully they will read this and do it better next rime."}
{"text":"I love coming here to eat. If you sign up for e mailes. You will get so many coupons. I also get the gift cards at sams club whenever I am shopping because you save another 25 bucks with them. We love the food. They are always fast on getting the food to you."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here on a Friday night and were really excited about it b/c we'd seen one near my old job in Carlsbad, CA. It was really packed so we thought well people don't wait in line for bad food, or do they?
We started with the apple gorgonzola salad b/c it was listed on the calorie count (very minimum info available for that so if its avail it must be ont he lower end of the scale that they are willing to divulge).

As for the entree they serve in these huge family style portions. The small serves 1-3 people and the large. who knows.. The Cardinals offensive line maybe? Well we ordered the quattro soemthing or another. It consisted of stuffed shells, mannicotti, chicken cannteloni and ravioli. The sauce was very minimal and tons of cheese. I left feeling guilty for thinking I'd just consumed an entire wheel of cheese- My bf was very disapointed in the ravioli - he thought it would be the best since it was the center of the dish. Wrong. It ranked dead last. We both agreed that the stuffed shells came in 1st place. If I went back to buca I'd def. go with the stuffed shells. To be honest though.. Las Vegas has so many other great restaurants the next place on my list is the sicilian place on E. Trop. so we'll see. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"I feel as though this place has gone down hill. Got here around 7:15 and was told it was going to be a half an hour, I was okay with that because it was my friends birthday and she really wanted to come here. Ended up being seated at 7:25 which was great. But then we got to our table and that my friends is when the waiting game began, and went on and on, and on and on. First out drinks came out right away. Our waitress delivered them and said she would be right back, then 15 mins go by. Then we order. We ordered the garlic cheese bread and waited 20 mins for that and of course it was cold. Waited 45 more mins for food. Which was not great. Baked ziti was dry and crispy. Not soft and filled with sauce. The only good dish was the chicken parmesean. Two of the tables next to us ended up having problems with their bill. And we sat next to dirty tables during our entire visit. Our waitress would stop by and check on us about every 20 mins. Only had one refil on my drink and had to drink my friend's water. The SADDEST PART WAS THAT THIS WAS MY FRIENDS BIRTHDAY ! We were so fed up with waiting that we didn't even tell them it was her birthday because we were tired of waiting so long! We needed up leaving around 9:15. Save your money and go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Came here this evening with the intent of using an advertised coupon.  Well, they would not honor the coupon even when I showed them in the app it was not giving a code.  Then the pasta dish was horrible. Chicken tasted boiled and unseasoned.  Had it replaced with something else.  Oh well.  This will be my LAST visit here as even the manager was unwilling to override and apply the coupon.  She was very unhelpful and another reason not to return.  I say avoid this place and find a better place to eat.  Maybe Va Bene. Cost more but superior food and management.  And leftovers the day are even worse.  Run fast away from this place"}
{"text":"Came here on our last night in Vegas. Sat us in a large booth. Server was very polite and on point. The hardest thing is trying to find vegetarian friendly food in Vegas. Ordered the Fettucine Alredo and asked for chicken on the side. They had no problem with it at all. Would highly recommend this place over a buffet considering the price. And if you stay at the Excalibur you get a $10 off coupon. 

Come here to overload on carbs and have a good night sleep!

Yeah Buddy!!!!!"}
{"text":"First things first, I'd like to say Thank you to management and staff as they were very accommodating to us during our visit. 
I hadn't heard much about this place but once I did. I just had to try it out for myself and see what all the talk is about. 
Traditionally I know vegans don't really have a place in Italian restaurants due to the cuisine being primarily cheese and meats. Thankfully they had a wide variety and very a helpful waiter who made sure my choices were animal product free. But first I must acknowledge the atmosphere of this place. It is a traditional Italian home and family like environment. With what looks like hundreds of pictures of Italian culture; family, love, togetherness and the appreciation for the simplicity of enjoying one another's company during a delicious Italian freshly made meal. 

First the bread with the oil and vinegar was in my option delicious. The bread tasted fresh and very soft.  I ordered the Apple Gorgonzola salad (I hope I spelled that right) and I must say this salad was absolutely amazing. Obviously I had the Gorgonzola cheese removed so I'm not sure how it tastes with it but It was sure good without it. I was able to share a small with my girlfriend and it was plenty enough plus enough for take home. To remind you I am a big guy 6'6 ft tall and I weigh 275lbs and just half of their small salad gave me exactly what I was looking for. 
For my main course I had the veggie pizza and needless to say I ate the entire thing. It was just scrumptious!
The best part of the experience was We having the pleasure to meet one of the managers Lindsey Luzier. She just happened to be there and made sure our welcome was a warm one. She was very friendly and accommodating. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. 

From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out I was amazed and convinced that this place will definitely be a must revisit for me."}
{"text":"I came here the Saturday before Easter, due to life events I am playing catch up on a lot of my reviews but this location did a great job accommodating a party of five adults and four children. I made reservations online and upon arrival they placed us in our own little tiny room section that was decorated beautifully . I posted a photo it was a night that had amazing service . I am not used to that when going to a chain especially with such a large party. To be honest a big reason might be because they don't automatically add gratuity on to the bill . Keep in mind that could always change so don't bank on that . I got a whole bunch of gift cards from costco to make the meal more affordable but if you join their bucca club they are always sending coupons . My favorite food of the night was the gnocchi but beware it's got a bit of  a kick!!! Now that I am writing about it I want to go get some right now!! This is a great place for good Italian food without is being outside of your budget!

I'm gonna list what we got but spare you the details of what it is because let's face it the menu can tell you that just fine . All I can say is everything we tried we loved and had left overs!
Bucca trio platter 
Large mozerella garlic bread 
Prosciutto stuffed chicken
Large ziti 
Small
Beppos soffici cuscini
Rosemary potatoes"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here because we saw several signs promoting an ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR. It was awesome ha Each drink was $5.41 at the bar. I had several red sangrias lol 

The food here is served family style so the portions are huge. We had the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni. It was pretty good, not enough chicken in the dish but it was just enough to balance out the large amount of alcohol we downed lol"}
{"text":"It was the MIL's birthday and darn it, she wants her freebie!  She must have spent hours researching restaurants that give treats for your birthday before settling on this one.  Yep, this is one of those times when you take it for the team.

I dropped my wife and her mother at the door, then went to find a parking spot.  When I got back and the four of us formed up in the small waiting room dominated by the elevated podium, the manager greeted us from on high and confirmed that we were complete.  After getting approval, he led us into the kitchen.  Walking your guests through the kitchen is a cute gimmick, but could backfire quickly - like when your guests see garbage on the floors, dirty cutting boards, cluttered with food scraps and cooks standing around looking bored.

This is a vast restaurant with several separate dining areas, all decorated very period schmaltzy Italian with lots of statues, dark fabrics and walls filled with images of I assume, Italian people.  We were led to a booth in a room with a center table filled with 15 teen-aged girls.  Just us and them.  Never mind that the restaurant was practically empty, with plenty of other quieter places, this is where they chose to seat us.  I guess this must have been the 'birthday party room\".

Our server was very astute.  She realized before we sat down that we wanted privacy.  Lot's of it, and we didn't want to be bothered with things like ordering our dinner, filling our drinks, delivering our order or checking in on us.  She let us ponder our predicament, unable to converse over the crowd of teens.  Besides, she had her hands full with the table of girls.

Eventually, we got our order in.  We chose to start with a delicious basket of garlic bread, followed with a wilted brown lettuce Caesar salad dusted with Parmesan powder.  It tasted like clorox-soaked spinach.  Moving on to the entree, our choice was a large Chicken Parmesan with a side of pasta and marinara.  I guess in this Italian-style place, your entree that is traditionally served with spaghetti is not.  You have to order it separately.  After allowing our entrees to cool in the kitchen for a bit, she eventually brought them around, dropping them on the table and quickly disappearing, with nary a word.  She had a very hands-off approach to service, which left us plenty of time to wonder what she was up to.

After mucking through dinner, it came time for the big birthday celebration.  A recently-thawed cake.  A candelabra.  A stupid made-up birthday song that the servers were forced to sing.  Who cares.  MIL was happy, she got her free dessert.

On a last note, when you do the birthday thing, there are several expectations.  First you must have a coupon.  Second, you must indicate online when you make a reservation for it.  Then, you must prove it.  This requires your printed coupon, your email reply to your online reservation indicating a birthday and several forms of ID to prove that you actually have a birth date.

Would I go back?  Not a chance, not even for free cake."}
{"text":"I don't get a restaurant that bills itself as \"family style\" that seats a group of ten in a booth that looks like a tunnel - one way in, one way out and no way for the server to get to the people buried at the deep end.  The people on the end near where you exit end up assisting the server with setting, feeding, refills and clearing.  What am I giving a tip for?

Anyway, the food is mediocre at best.  I was forced to go because apparently I am the only person in my extended family that was gifted with taste buds that work.  We ordered a bunch of stuff, and judging from what I had, I would guess it all pretty much sucked.  I ordered cheese ravioli with meat sauce.  The cheese ravioli was acceptable for frozen raviolis, but the meat sauce appeared to be a handful of broken-up hamburgers tossed into some watery marinara.

Please.  If there is a Christian God, answer my prayer and please talk to my family and tell them there are better places out there for Italian fare.  $250 later and all I feel is the onset of indigestion."}
{"text":"This place was a shambles. OK, so it was Labor Day, but if you are going to give most of the staff the night off, then do not take lots of reservations and tell everybody that comes in it is a 10 minute wait.

Having been told that it would be a 10 - 15 minute wait, 30 minutes later we where still sitting around, twiddling our thumbs. We were then told that some other party of three had taken our spot. When we finally got seated we then sat for another 15 minutes before a waiter came over. He did at least apologise and said he thought another waiter was taking care of us. We stopped him mid welcoming speech and ordered a large pizza, that was supposed to feed four or more. The three of us finished it quickly and were still hungry. The toppings were sparse and totally missing on some pieces.

I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Came in Friday evening for dinner about 8:30 PM.
Had the Spicy Chicken Penne with Linguine Noodle in place of the Penne noodle. Somewhat spicy, but needed a bit of salt/ garlic to boost up the flavor. Also, ordered the Spicy Arrabbiata Pizza which will feed many! It's a thin crusted pizza with great toppings & very tasty. Our server was pleasant & we \"over all\" had a nice time dinning here. However, Felt it's a little pricey for what it's worth..
FYI- they do offer kids meals for 10 & under too! :)"}
{"text":"Although we visited on a Saturday evening, we arrived around six, we were seated within 10 minutes because the restaurant was not very busy.  We were taken to a table which was not yet cleaned. After waiting a while for a waiter to take our drink order finally the manager took the order.  A nearby waiter recognized that we had been sitting for a long time without drinks or a waiter.  Because of him our waiter arrived a short time later and took our order.  We would have enjoyed our mozzarella garlic bread while we waited for our entrees, but it all arrived all together. The food, with the exception of the bread, was lukewarm at best.  While several tables around us cleared out, I never saw a busboy clear the tables.  We were disappointed by the discombobulated staff and disorganization in every step of our dining experience.  I honestly doubt I will returned this location."}
{"text":"Revised: 

Mediocre food, but it's great for large groups because the portions are huge. To be fair, some of the food items are pretty good - above average even. However, some items are simply awful. Their chicken is crappy and their alfredo sauce is flavorless. Most of their dishes say \"chain\" to me. Their prices do not though. 

I've ordered takeout from this place more than a few times - typically pizza. For 20 bucks, you get a lot of food. I actually really like their pizza - the pepperonis they use are the size of your fist. The Caesar salad here is gross. Hit or miss from dish to dish. 

I have mixed feelings about Buca. I think I'm between a 3 and a 4 on this place... originally, I had this at a 4, but I'm now changing that to a 3. The service there is great and I really like the decor and atmosphere... it's just that the food can be so hit or miss. 

The main issue here is that there are several italian restaurants in spitting distance that are heaps better. This place serves the needs of a special niche - large group dining. Take a friend here for a birthday bash. Have a family get together here. Dungeons and Dragons reunion meeting. Dinner for two? Forget about it..."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent and service is always great. Best family style Italian restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour....$3 beers all day. Good service, no to crowded, looks the same as the California locations. Relaxing atmosphere, everyone looked like they were enjoying themselves, maybe because they were all buzzed."}
{"text":"Just updating that the manager tried giving me a coupon to have me delete my review.. Of course I wouldn't do this because its just not right. 

Anyways my review still stands and never ate at one location since this day."}
{"text":"Not bad, and really good value if you use coupon"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm home. This place is so full of comfort and hospitality, you'll think you've been welcomed home by your grandma.  Fallon took amazing care of me tonight. Thank you. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I am only deducting a star because there were heaps of empty tables and not enough staff so we had to wait half an hour. The food was spectacular this time and totally 5 star. Pizza was just perfect and our waiter was lovely. The chicken parmigiana was divine like last time and the cheesecake and mudcake were perfect. Great red wine recomendation. Seriously glad we gave it another shot. Very very worth it"}
{"text":"I've been to Buca Di Beppo a handful of times.  This was my first time at this location though and what a disappointment!

With a party of about twenty, we ordered several large plates to share.  

To start, we began with the Chopped Antipasto Salad ($15.99).  This was probably the only tasty thing I enjoyed and I definitely didn't get enough of it.  Fried Calamari ($14.99) was the next to arrive.  When it comes down to it, one can never mess up calamari as long as you eat it while it's hot.  Some of the entrees I had a taste of included the Pepperoni Pizza ($19.99), Spaghetti Meat Balls $21.99), Chicken Marsala ($24.99), and Veal Limone ($24.99).  The pizza was not good, period.  The spaghetti meatballs was not bad, and the chicken marsala was the only decent entree available.  The real disgusting dish was the veal though. Blah!  It looked bad and tasted bad. 

When it came down to it, the dinner cost me $40 and I was still starving when I left.  It was such a waste! 

Service was okay - not bad, not exceptionally good.  Just average.  

The only highlight was the nice guys sitting at the bar who ordered a round of shots for the girls in our birthday party.  Hooray for nice guys!  (They were also a good sport too!)"}
{"text":"We took my father to Buca di Beppo for his 61st birthday. Prior to arriving my mother made reservations specifically stating it was my fathers birthday. After finishing our meal my mother showed our waiter her reservations specifically saying it was my father's birthday. Our waiter never acknowledged my father's birthday; however, three other tables around us received cakes with candles and were sang to!

Aside from the poor service from our waiter the food was terrible. I've had some of the best Italian food there is, and this by far is the worst! This will be our last time at Buca di Beppo. For the waiter that completely ignored my father's birthday karma is a bitch......."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  The servers are rude and not attentive to my needs.  It is impossible to enjoy a gathering with family or friends since the atmosphere is incredibly loud.  Bring earplugs if you plan on dining in!

The food is served family style and the portions are large.  However, the quality has gone downhill in recent months.  The pastas are either over cooked or still raw.  The sauces have been skimpy and lack flavor.  The Alfredo used to be good but now it tastes like salty warm milk.

I ordered to go and wasn't made aware of an item not being available until I went to pick it up.  They had my phone number; I don't know why I wasn't called."}
{"text":"We arrived early (around 4:30) to beat the graduation rush. It wasn't busy yet by any means, but the service was awful and slow. The waitress was less than enthusiastic from the very beginning and after checking on us only once after giving us our food she disappeared, so I had to flag someone else down to pay the check. That lady I flagged down was a lot nicer and brought us to-go boxes (but without the plastic bag). The original waitress finally came back and gave us our receipt and said \"Let me get you a bag\" and went off again. If she would have given me a second to speak, I would have said no thanks. I wasn't going to wait 10 minutes for a bag. Oh, and never once were we offered a refill of our drinks. For the price you pay here, you'd expect better service."}
{"text":"Spot-on family restaurant. Cant go wrong with calamari and pasta. Nice sicilian vibe and  ostalgic atmosphere. Service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo is know for its great culture and large plates.  Chandler Buca offers personal attention to its customers with a positive attitude.  Joe the Paisano has produced a restaurant that reflects his easy going attitude and dedication to high service and food quality. 
Buca is a great place to host a large group of people.  For small events rent out a room with no extra charge, what is better than that.  

If you like chocolate try the cake or treat yourself and a few friends to Buca's Tiramisu."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and likely won't be back again after tonight. If I'm spending $50 per person on dinner and drinks at a chain restaurant, I should be able to expect friendly service at the least. Mary was totally annoyed by our presence from the time we sat down. Bread never came, and drinks took forever to come out. Every time she came to the table, she seemed down right pissed that we were there. The food we eventually got was good, but when we had leftover, Mary dropped three tins in front of me with instructions....\"for the leftovers.\" I've been here many times, and always thought it was nice when the server took the leftover and brought it back all packed up and ready to go. Charge me $200 for chain Italian? Ok. If it's a good time, I'll play along. Charge me $200 for chain Italian, and treat me like you're doing me a favor by bringing me a beer? I won't be back."}
{"text":"Judging by the lack of responses I am going to assume that no one here really cares how crappy the food or service is... 

Our server was awful... she took forever for drinks did not know how to open wine, had zero personality and seemed basically awkward at the table. We were there for a birthday that was paid for in advance, yet she saw fit to discuss the bill with the entire table. 

All and all the food was bland and supermarket stale. If they did not drench the cake in frosting it would've been completely inedible as I don't know they managed to dry the cake out that much...

The icing... was the state of the restrooms... and the manager told me he just checked them ... see pics below and you be the judge ."}
{"text":"I came to Buca with some co-workers for a job well done celebration. I'm not a real fan of chain Italian restaurants, but Buca is different with the atmosphere, being able to handle large parties, and if course family-style dining. We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky. Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair. Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat. 

We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad. The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking. 

We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good. We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat & potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly. To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas. It was really good. We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good. No one seemed to be holding back. 

We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata. The deserts were fantastic. Really good and everyone enjoyed it. 

The service was right on. Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks. Food came out in a timely manner too. So I have no complaints about the service. 

So overall, I had a very good meal with lots of variety of food and massive amounts to fill up everyone. Coming here is about having a fun time and good Italian food. So enjoy, eat up but don't forget to unbuckle that belt after you eat all that food."}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered baked ziti and penne al vodka pasta. Penne al vodka was spicy and we really enjoyed the food.

Even though there was a wait time,the service was fast.Reasonable prize and the quantities that they serve is more than the what we expect!! Plan accordingly. 

We stayed at Excalibur and so we got 10% discount which was Amazing. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I like buca di beppo when I've tried it in other cities. This one lacks a bit. We still enjoyed our chicken Parm, spaghetti, and cheese bread. The Alfredo was very disappointing though. Served cold at first then replaced with hotter version still no flavor. We told the buser when they asked and they said they hear that a lot, the. Why not fix it?!? Oh well is was a decent meal and I like the family style. Oh and the creme cake is great."}
{"text":"Went to Buca on 29th of December. Service was horrible. Hostess tried to sit my family at a table not ready after reservations were made. Started to order food and our waiter just walked off to get us water while I was in the middle of talking to him. Appetizers were good and received in a timely manner. Main course took a lot longer with some items cold. 

Our table was close to the waiter/waitress station and the conversations were highly unprofessional but staff members. Staff complained about the ordering system, customers, and the sangria. Not sure why the sangria, but oddly enough they did. Saddest part, the table next to us sat for 15 min before the waiter acknowledged them. They walked out. No leadership at all with management hiding in the shadows. Don't waste your money. I hate to say that because my family and I have been going to the restaurant for 20 years. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Less than one star.
I have ordered from them 4 times, 3 of which the order was WRONG.
Food was COLD, bread BURNED and STALE.
Attitude of the cashier was less than friendly.
They got my order wrong, but, instead of just giving me the large pizza, rather than the correct small pizza, they cut it into thirds.  
I got 1/3 of a cold pizza, while some other unsuspecting customer got a cold, old pizza.
I told them I would pick order up AT 6:45.  It had been made early, so it was cold, needed to heat it in microwave.
The online system was out of order.  I called in the order, cashier confirmed SMALL, but they made LARGE.
I heated in microwave and I live 2 blocks away.
Third Time is NOT a charm.  I is a signal to go somewhere else.
And, to make it worse, the manager acts as though it is the customer's fault that the order is wrong.
For the prices they charge, they could at least include some courtesy and a smile."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.   Been coming for over 15 yrs to the Summerlin location.  Quality has totally gone downhill.   Ordered pepperoni pizza, fettuccini Alfredo and spaghetti and meatballs.   Pizza was ok but pastas were horrible.  Absolutely NO taste.   Everyone in our group of 5 agreed.   It's like they forgot to use any garlic, salt, basil or pepper.    One of guests in our group hit the nail on the head...we should have known something was up when no garlic smell was either inside or outside of restaurant!!!!   Told manager and she said thanks for telling her.   Will NOT be returning.   Sad.  Had so many good memories here.    Olive Garden is so much better and not as expensive."}
{"text":"The food are like average nothing special, soda is like 3 something to 4 bucks and I don't get refill then we have so much on our table but charge like 18% automaticly in each of our bill but then we all split it so we all get charge it's suppose to atleast like 15% I mean our server is like nice and stuff but if I want to get charge that much percentage of the bill atleast I get a refill for a fountain soda that cost like a freaking $1 smh it's my first time and not big with Italian food I got the pasta Alfredo fettuccine whatever taste so plain I ate mostly likely the Parmesan garlic bread I mean who can't make that better .. But I'm just saying make the money worth so I'm not coming back to this place ever again !!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious as always and our waitress Kelsey was very sweet. We ordered the custom pasta and mozzarella garlic bread which came out fairly quick."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this location. My mother and father planned a wedding months in advance, and decided to have the reception/dinner at Buca. We called a month and advance and asked if they would put their cream lemon cake on hold for us because that would be our wedding cake. we told them the quantity how many we needed and asked for them to put a note on our reservation. First off, when we called to put on this request the woman on the phone was extremely rude and told us \"we have big parties all the time we'll have enough cake\".

Now that's fast forward to the wedding day. We get there and have a party of 20 people. Our bill was over $1000 and we only had one server. Overall the service throughout the dinner was poor and slow and the waiter was extremely rude. When you would request something he would say \"I don't have time for that right now I'll get it when I do\". To me that's unacceptable and poor management, if you see you have a party of 20 people assigned more waiters. Then now let's get to the cake. We ordered the cake, the same amount we told The lady on the phone a month ago, and we were told they didn't even have half the amount of pieces that we wanted. We spoke to the manager and he told us that there was no note on our reservation and that pretty much there's nothing he can do. We expressed to him that this is a huge disappointment because this is a wedding cake and he just shrugged his shoulders like he didn't care. No compensation for the poor planning on their end or the upset on our end. After about 15 minutes of us deciding what we should do, he came back and said he \"found cakes in the back but they have been in the freezer\". If you've ever had this cake you'd know it tastes best at room temperature. I'm glad he ended up finding it but considering it wasn't at serving quality and not as good as it would have been if they had been set aside like we asked them to, we were still disappointed. And then we were still charged for the cake!!! 


Overall horrible management and organization. When you mess up on a wedding parties order, at least have some empathy with the party. The wedding cake is a big deal and now all we will remember is horrible service we had when we think back on this day and reception. Makes me not even want to go back to the Bucca in my hometown."}
{"text":"Place is a bit overwhelming but not unexpected from any Italians point of view. Great options on the menu, they have thee best salad but a bit high in price for a dinner salad with nothing in it. And it says serves two, not the case. 
Dinner was great, shrimp pasta dish could have used a bit more garlic. It was not as spiced up. Gnocchi was to die for! 
Server, WEIRD woman."}
{"text":"Really delicious food and awesome service. I got seated in the pope room which was super cool :)
The Diablo pasta is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Large crowds can be confusing but the food was great and our large crowd enjoyed the evening. They did a good job keeping our orders straight for about 25 people. I enjoyed my dinner very much I thought it was the best food in a long time. Only thing was they could have brought out some butter for the bread, but they did so when we asked. 

Great job to the servers here! We are repeat customers and come here for after Taekwondo Tournamemt dinners as a large group. We keep coming back for a reason!"}
{"text":"After this experience, I can say my husband and I won't be back to Buca di Beppo again. From the start it was a terrible experience. We arrived exactly 11 minutes before our reservation which I know because the hostess essentially scolded us. We arrived, let her know we had a 6pm reservation for four, she asked if we wanted to wait for the rest of our party or go ahead and be seated. Thinking we'd grab a glass of wine and relax until our sons arrived, we said we'd go ahead and be seated and that we'd like to sit on the patio if possible. We were then told that she was going to wait to seat us, not because our table wasn't ready but because our reservation wasn't until 6pm and it was only 5:49pm and then she went on to say we might not be able to sit on the patio because it might not be open, although there was a table seated out there already. I have never arrived early for a reservation to a restaurant that wasn't full and been told, well I am going to wait to seat you because your reservation isn't for another 11 minutes. That's a loss of revenue in extra drinks and even appetizers. While our server was good, the food was mediocre at best. In fact, I think the food on a buffet not only taste better but is of better quality. The quality of product offered by Buca has really gone downhill. I took a moment to let the manager of the restaurant know how the hostess had handled things when we arrived and he seemed uninterested in the situation and simply made excuses. Overall with the poor customer service and the mediocre food, we won't be back as it is just overpriced for the product served and offered."}
{"text":"Awesome. Family style meals.  great food service experience.  Meatballs that weigh you down.."}
{"text":"Getting takeout from here is like pulling teeth. The slowest place you'll ever go to. Never ever again."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  We made a reservation for 25 for my wedding reception and we couldn't have been happier.  They remembered to take care of my gluten free guest and they made sure all of our other guests were treated like royalty.  The food was amazing!  We had the chicken limone, cannelloni and another pasta dish that was SO GOOD!  The manager came by to make sure we were happy and of course we were.  After speaking to our guests they said their food was as good as we thought ours was!  These days I prefer to eat at home because I hate paying good money for food that I can make even better at home.  This is one of the places I would put on my short list as a go to for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken rigatoni was not spicy @ all, sauce watery and tasteless. Had a $20 off coupon on phone. Showed it to server before ordering.He wrote down the coupon #, when check came had to ask to have coupon applied. Server returned to say coupon not accepted in computer. Asked to have manager look @ it and was coupon could not be used because we didn't but certain dishes,
Food was disappointing and so was the service."}
{"text":"Our first experience with Buca was very pleasing, our server JAKE was very knowledge of the menu, and didn't even need to write down what we ordered, and he never made any mistakes. very impressed.  the décor through out the restaurant is just to cool and a trip to the restroom is an adventure.   We love the family style meals and was unaware this is how they serve all meals,  it would have been nice for some type of mixed meal, to try a variety of things especially for us newbies.    They are a bit pricey. but all food was very tasteful."}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas for 3 years now, and only just last week did I hear about this restaurant from some co-workers. Four of us went to dinner on a Sunday at 7, and the first thing I noticed was the full parking lot. I expected it to be half empty, at best, at the end of the weekend. The second noticeable thing about this place was the interior decor. I've read some of the other reviews on here about the decor, and while I can see why some patrons didn't care for it, I loved it. I loved the black and white photos on the walls, the antique furniture in the lobby, and the empty, multi-colored wine bottles in the racks on the ceiling. All of that, along with the Greek-style statues, gave the place an old-world, homey feel. I couldn't wait to taste the food.

Since there was four of us, we each ordered a small entree. I was able to sample the chicken saltimbocca, chicken marsala, shrimp florentine, and fettucini supremo. Simply put, all of it was incredible. Until now, I though Olive Garden was the best Italian I'd ever had, but this place makes OG look like McDonald's. The portions, even on a small entree, were more than enough for four of us, and we each took home plenty of leftovers.

And then, as if that wasn't good enough, I decided to sample the dessert menu. I ordered the Italian creme cake, the cheesecake, and my coworkers ordered the chocolate chip cannolis. In my limited foodie experience, most restaurants have the desserts delivered and kept frozen until ready to serve. They taste no better than what you find in the freezer section of your local grocery. This was most definitely NOT the case with Buca di Beppo. Of those three that we sampled, my favorite was the cheesecake. Really good cheesecake is hard to find, and this place more than did it justice. The giant slice came with raspberry topping and hazelnuts. It was hard not to be rude and devour the whole damn thing in front of my co-workers. The Italian creme cake was also to die for, and the cannoli was amazing. (I'd never actually had a cannoli before, but, judging by the other desserts, I'm sure this place would take the blue ribbon if it put them a contest.)

All in all, I was thoroughly satisfied with my dining experience at Buca di Beppo. and, if I could afford it, I would eat here every night."}
{"text":"Not very vegetarian friendly. They only had one vegetarian option (squash ravioli), and the best way I could describe it is MEH. They may or may not have vegan friendly salad, but I'm not sure. Conclusion: NOT a place for vegans or vegetarians."}
{"text":"I really don't get what all the fuss is about, we've been here twice and each time it was just...okay--not bad, but not amazing like everyone says it is. 

Service is fine, but I've definitely had better, tastier Italian. 

Especially this last time; we were at a rehearsal dinner, and they had bread, salads, chicken marsala, meat spaghetti and alfredo. Everything was just bland and dry, maybe because it was a big rehearsal dinner, but still. Being that Bucca di Beppo is in downtown Scottsdale and parking is horrendous, we probably won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was skeptic about service at this place, but i didn't experience anything negative. 
We ate late lunch/early dinner at 4pm. 
The welcoming staff took a little till we were sited, our waitress was kind and helpful. The food (minestrone soup and the shrimp florentine were both really good and plenty) 
I have nothing negative to say about tis place. I enjoyed myself"}
{"text":"Don't bother wasting your time or money going here. My boyfriend and I have been to various Bucas with no problems at all. We had just finished coming from a tour with Molly Trolleys. 
We got seated in the area where the bar is at and waiter was nice. After placing our order which was a side order of spaghetti and fettuccine Alfredo with two meatballs,  we asked and decided to move to a different booth due to cold air ventilation. 

Our order came out fine and as we are eating I glanced up towards the bar and to my sighting I see what I thought to be a rat run across the floor. I took a double take as I couldn't believe it and raised my voice to my boyfriend in disgust to see what actually happened to be a mouse run under the original booth we were previously sitting at.

I was so disgusted and my boyfriend and I were in shock that we stopped eating our food and didn't even finish our dinner. We stood up and told the guy at the bar if we can get our check. I quote my boyfriend told him dude I believe and think you have rats in your restaurant as we just saw one run across the floor. The bartender said and I quote \" no sir we don't have rats we only have mice\". My boyfriend and I looked at each other and at him to tell him we want our check and done. 

As we are standing and waiting, the bartender came and told us that the manager would come to see us. During our waiting period to get our bill and have the manager see us, guess what?!?! We see another mouse run across the floor. At this time we are totally disgusted and done and the guy who was our waiter came out to let us know our bill has been taken care of.

My boyfriend and I are disgusted and hope not to get sick from eating here. We are also in shock that an employee  (bartender) would respond as if it's normal and ok they have mice. I believe this is a serious health issue and sanitation concern. I hope others read this review before considering eating at this disgusting and horrible establishment"}
{"text":"The food just wasn't too good. It wasn't _bad_. It might have been better than something I would have made at home. It just wasn't very good. And at around $18/person for my party, there are plenty of better options.

The atmosphere was awesome though! Very Italian. Lots of cool pictures and statues and stuff."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place. I can't believe I didn't know it existed until now. I'm a sucker for Italian food, and this place is just the place to be when the cravings are extra. The menu is just perfect, everything sounds delicious. I wasn't sure how to decide. Eventually I decided on lasagna. It was absolutely delicious, best I've ever had honestly. I loved the fact that they give you the exact about that you feel you should be paying for. The prices may be a little bit high but it's absolutely worth it. On my second visit I was beyond excited I know it's already perfect although seeing the prices may scare you at first. Haha. It's all worth the trip. Every time. I'm in love with this place."}
{"text":"A friend took me to Buca di Beppo, assuring I'd love it, and he was right. I'm a sucker for Italian food I gotta say, this place is just a must. I liked just about everything about the restaurant. The experience was great. I fell in love with their lasagna. I dream about it. I can not wait to return."}
{"text":"The lasagna: the noodles were so overcooked that when I ate a bite of it, I could not distinguish the texture of the noodle at all. It was like eating a mushy glob of ricotta, crappy tomato sauce and cheese. I love Italian food. When it's bad it's good. This wasn't even bad. The frozen lasagna from the grocery store for a dollar is better. The bread was decent, but expensive for something that should probably be free ($4.99)."}
{"text":"Food was ok. It wasn't bad, just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute, but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to eat there occasionally. We would have our Anniversary or Birthday's there but the last two times they must have changed the cook and there dishes were dry not enough tomato sauce, we would get the eggplant parm full plate it was huge but it got smaller and smaller and was dry as well. The steamed mussels used to be good too,with the white and red sauce mixed the last time we went the size was smaller and they barely put enough sauce, The calamari was very fishy smelling. I think it went thru some transition so we are going to try it one more time. I am going to ask for extra sauce and extra cheese. They did not even warn you the last two times that the servings were huge? Wish us luck."}
{"text":"Not a fan of one of the managers here. He wouldn't accept an online coupon I had, so I spent nearly an hour looking through my old emails. I couldn't find it, so I finally left. He didn't show any empathy and concern, and he kept saying how he was powerless to do anything for me. One of the owners (?) offered me a gift card, but the entire experience left a very bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't go back to this Buca di Beppo location."}
{"text":"My sister was visiting from Australia and has a thing for Buca so we ended up here. 

Caesar salad- disappointing that they got rid of  serving anchovies and lemon on the side since that was made it into a good, real Caesar. It's not that hard to keep small cans of anchovies around since they keep for ages. 

Caprese salad- it's standard and hard to screw up. The components were all fresh. 

Stuffed mushrooms- in a huge portion restaurant it came with 6 small crimini mushrooms. They were decent, but nothing standout. 

Veal Parmigiana- it was okay...the breading soggy with oil. I've had this at other Bucas, where it was much better. My brother wanted eggplant, but that was something taken off the menu as well because there's an eggplant shortage currently.

4 Cheese pizza- Parmesan, ricotta, mozzarella and provolone cheeses were fine, but there was something missing. This didn't have sauce so it was more like garlic cheese bread. I put some more parmesan and some red pepper to give it something more. 

Baked ziti- this was pretty decent with a tomato creamy sauce. Too bad this wasn't something we ordered a big portion of, but a buca individual serving that was free taste from a coupon I found on the Yelp page. 

White and red pitchers of sangria- good flavors, but didn't even feel a buzz and I'm a cheap drunk. 

Our server was very nice, sassy and full of personality and brought out brownies for both brothers birthdays. Even though service was good, the food was just A-OK so I can't give it more than a 3/OK rating."}
{"text":"BF said he's had some past bad experiences with Buca in the past so we decided to go and give em a try at the other location (he said he does not like the service at the Paradise one). We also got a $10 off coupon in a ValPak so why not? I've been to the one in Universal Citywalk in LA a few times for birthdays and always had a decent night. 

They walked us through the kitchen which my BF liked and said the other location didnt take him the two times he's gone. I definitely respect this that you get to see a clean kitchen and they are proud to pass people through it before seating them.

We ordered a  Penne San Remo (chicken breast, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, peas,cream sauce). Big family serving even for a \"small\". Pretty decent dish, just needed a little salt and it was right on.

They gave us a bread basket and bread was cold....I'm noticing this a lot in restaurants lately- refrigerated bread served as is. Anyways it was decent for sopping up cream sauce.

Service was decent, the lady was on refilling drinks and checking up on us. 

Overall, alright spot. I think it would be better if we showed up for lunch since they have individual portions or come when we got a hungry group of friends."}
{"text":"I held my company Christmas party here over the weekend and it was a wonderful experience.  

From the moment I requested information on holiday parties back in September and was responded to immediately by the Sales Manager, Rebecca; to the moment I walked in for the actual party and was escorted to our private event room the whole experience was efficient, friendly and professional.

Our party went smoothly, the food was delicious, the cocktails (with the exception of the mojito, which seemed to be mixed in an 'unusual' way) were very good, and the servers assigned to us, Jordan and another young man (who's name I didn't catch), were very efficient and friendly.  I will not hesitate to hold another event here.  

I was really very pleased."}
{"text":"Didnt want to cook today so Christmas lunch at Buca Di Beppo with the family. As always wonderful food. Darren our waiter gets five stars! Very courteous! Love the photo they took for us!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here in June while on Vacation in Las Vegas. My husband had a bad feeling about this place but I convinced him to eat here. I ordered Chicken Marsala which came with a salad. The salad was good until I found a piece of paper in it. I told the waitress and she took the salad to a manager. When she returned, she informed me that the paper I found was a gum wrapper. How disgusting!!!! And what was even worse, is that a manager never came to our table to speak with us or offer an apology. The server told us that we would not be charged for the salad. I lost my appetite after that and did not eat my dinner. The waitress apologized and I let her know that she was not to blame. I have worked in the restaurant  buisness for 25 years and I know that when a customer has a complaint, a manager addresses the issue by speaking with the customer. I also know that the wraper ended up in the salad as a result of an employee throwing a piece of gum away. Nobody saw it land in the salad? Most establishments that serve food prohibit employees from chewing gum because of health codes. I understand that sometimes things happen, but it was very unprofessional that none of the managers came to our table. I saw managers walking around the restaurant but none came to our table. It is disgusting that an employee would throw a gum wrapper instead of walking to the garbage can to throw it away. Of all the years, I have eaten at restaurants, I have never complained. I should have listened to my husband's good instincts and stayed away from this place. We will be traveling to Las Vegas again in a few weeks, and I'm staying away from this place."}
{"text":"For Mother's Day my folks wanted us all to go here.  My mom made reservations 3 weeks ago for a group of 20 people at 1pm for a private room.  The group setting was 10 adults and 10 kids. We got there (our whole party of 20) at 12:55 and they told us it would be a few minutes until we would be seated.  Well that turned into a long wait.  We did not sit down until 1:45PM.  I spoke with the manager and he said there was nothing he could do until the other table got up.   He did say he would get us a couple appetizers so they would be ready when we sit down. The thing I don't understand is if you have a reservation confirmed for 20 at 1PM why did they put someone at that table? Maybe they thought these people would be done in time for our 1PM.   And why should anyone wait 45 minutes for their table to be ready when they have reservations?  

So we sit down at 1:45 with 10 adults at one table and 10 kids at another.  We got some appetizers and salads and food. 

The servers did a good job.  The slow kitchen wasn't their fault.  I give this place 2 stars for the food.  Our bill came and the manager only gave us a few appetizers as a comp.  We asked to talk to the Manager.  At that point it was an assistant manager who really seemed like he had no clue what was going on in the restaurant and said he needed to talk to the general manager for a larger comp. We waited for 15 minutes for the GM to finally make it to our table.  The manager did end up taking more off the total bill but did not earn our business of 20 people to come back.  They really dropped the ball from reservation delay to slow kitchen service. The real problem with this place is lacking in management across the board from our experience."}
{"text":"I know this review is really late, but I figured late is better than never! Nothing but great service here! All great meals and drinks! We visited this restaurant everyday of our week stay!

Morgan took great care of us and Norrese was such a great host! He showed us every dish going out and explained what it was. Great good! Great entertainment!!"}
{"text":"Buca Di Beppo is an awesome family-style restaurant that serves up authentic Italian dishes in a cozy atmosphere.  They always play Italian music and the last time I went, some mobster look-alikes were having a nice dinner before they went and wacked someone I'm sure.

The dishes are all big enough to share, so it's fun to order a few different dishes and then pass them around the table.  

If you have a big enough party and you make reservations ahead of time, you can ask to be seated in the 'Pope' room.  There is actually a pope head in the middle of the table, and you can spin him around and if he happens to land on you, you're supposed to confess all of your sins. It's funny, I swear."}
{"text":"Food so so waitress ask me to remove small pieces of bread on plate when i ask for more bread.  What no fresh clean plate. Wow. Not offered any Romano Cheese no fresh grated cheese insight.  This was not good at all not to mention standing 20 minutes for seating and no one else around i would say don't waste time or money run run run"}
{"text":"First time here... And boy do I feel awful giving out people giftcards to this place.... So not impressed!

Firstly, we waited about 10 mins before our server came. We never got utensils since they were still 'folding' them.... I personally had to steal them from an empty table.

We ordered the cheesy bread with spinach and tomatoes, Apple gorzongola salad and baked ziti. Also got a wine... They didn't have Fizz 56 which I wanted to try so I ended up settling for white zin (15 min process to find out that this wine didn't exist today... Although my husband's beer came out quickly). 

Don't buy the cheesy bread. It is seriously the same as the other bread with a crap ton of cheese... Barely any spinach or tomatoes.

The salad was ok. Not as good as described. 

The baked ziti wasn't as good as anything we have eaten from Olive Garden. It was ok, but not great.

Our server was undeniably slow, although she was quite nice when she came by (Sheri). Had to ask the bus boy for water, and never received a refill (she never came by until the check). So whatever. First and last time at this place!

Will not be returning. Ever. Seriously, Olive Garden is a million steps up from this place!!

When we left the hostess was even too busy texting to say THANK YOU. Take your business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Went to the location in Val Vista and the 60 and as soon as we walked through the door the hostess was annoyed with a group of people who clearly needed special attention. We were not greeted at all which would have been fine if she was actually taking care of the patrons with special needs but the first words out of her mouth in the most condescending tone ever was \"would you like to wait 45 minutes?\" Needless to say it was my first visit to one of these restaurants and we walked out the door before being seated. I will never visit a Buca again. Your loss."}
{"text":"This place functions like a Chinese sit-down restaurants where all the items are meant to be shared. Almost all the menu items have a small (serves 2 people) and a large (serves 4 people). That's all and good, but it has an issue: it's a lie. 

My buddy and I ordered a small pizza... But we both agreed that we could have eaten that small pizza by ourselves and be satisfied. A small item and a side is sufficient food for two adults. 

Another issue is that it took an inordinate amount of time for a waiter to even service us."}
{"text":"As far as chain Italian restaurants go, this leads the pack.

We are used to Buca being extremely busy and noisy (holidays, weekend nights, etc), but we came in for dinner on a mid-week night. The restaurant was nearly empty, quiet, and the staff was welcoming on our way to our table.

We got Donny as our waiter. He is extremely lively (he admits his enthusiasm; ha), accommodating, understanding, and personable.

Given their huge menu, we took forever to place our order. They do serve \"family style\", so most dishes can be split for 2 people. If you are there with one other person, you could get one dish and a side, or two dishes if you both want each others food and are fairly hungry.

We decided to start with the Antipasti Buca Trio. We had a shellfish allergy at our table, but the manager and the waiter were both understanding and went above and beyond to make our order conform to our needs. For the record they are also able to accommodate gluten-intolerant guests and offer a separate one-sheet laminated menu upon request.

The calamari was crunchy, and the portion size in the trio was good. The breading wasn't too thick, the calamari wasn't greasy, and the marinara sauce was for dipping was delicious (they offer jars of the stuff for sale).

Their stuffed mushrooms were the best we've had. Compared to some other restaurants, these mushrooms were fairly large, the stuffing was overflowing, and the pesto they were served over was creamy and nutty.

We ordered the Chopped Salad (wonderful dressing, large portion), Chicken Carbonara with whole grain penne pasta (can be ordered in any dish), and the Chianti Braised Short Ribs.

The portion for the short ribs was two fairly large slabs of beef. This dish did not have sides, so one hungry person could finish the entree, or it can be split. The ribs themselves were sub-par; they were fairly grizzly (a lot of fat around the edges and throughout). The meat was moist and juicy though, and the sauce was sweet, savory, and delicious. After cutting away all of the grizzle, I was able to easily finish the two pieces of beef.

The Carbonara was very good. A lot of prosciutto and chicken throughout, and it was seasoned very well with no additional salt necessary.

Although fairly full at this point, we cannot visit an Italian restaurant without trying the Tiramisu. Wow!! Our favorite Tiramisu we've ever tried. Although there wasn't as much espresso and rum flavor as I would have hoped, it was so creamy and delicious. The portion size was huge, it was well priced, and I would go back ten-fold just for the dessert!! The best part?? The walnut brownie chunks served on top!

Love Buco, would recommend this location, and ask for Donny if you can handle a lot of enthusiasm and laughter. Sure it is expensive, but for a special occasion it is wonderful. Get the Tiramisu!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here about once a year to celebrate something- anniversary, birthday or just that we didn't scream at our kids that week. Whatever!  Anyway... we love the chicken cannaloni and the Ravioli.  I love their bruschetta! We finally took our kids there with us last time and they didn't like it.  The pizza was not the Americanized Dominos style kind that they are used to.  So they didn't like it.  Anyway.... we now know better than to take them with us.  It is our special place- No kids aloud with us!!! Great place! Love all the décor.  (best moment was when my kids came out of the bathroom totally laughing because of the pictures of the semi naked ladies on the wall) :)"}
{"text":"We have eaten here two times.  The first time, the food was ok.  Nothing good enough to make us go back.  We tried the Fettuccine Alfredo.  

We then got a gift card and went back to use it.  We got the \"make your own pasta\" with garlic oil sauce, mushrooms, broccoli and sauteed onions to go.  We asked for meatballs on the side.  Our order included meatballs on  top of the pasta with red bell pepper.  We told them the order was incorrect.  They took it back and clearly picked out the meatballs and put them in a to go box.  They left the red peppers.  This was obvious because it took them 3 min to fix the problem.  The staff was not apologetic and clearly rushed the order the second time to get us out the door.     Also, we called in the order and they told us it would take 20 min.  We arrived to pick up our dinner 20 mins later.  It was not ready.  We waited another 20 mins...then it was wrong.  All of this shows us that BDB doesn't take pride in their customer service to rectify mistakes.  Since the quality of food is not that good, expensive for what you get and this mistake....we won't go back."}
{"text":"This place gets ZERO stars from me. First off, after ordering Lasagna I'm told that they are sold out. What Italian restaurant runs out of lasagna? This was not even mentioned from our waitress when seated. We ordered chicken parmigiana and with that being said, had to order $20 noodles to go with because \"at this place\" for some reason, does not serve pasta with their chicken parmigiana! 
The chicken was cold- the pasta was cold. I ask for a refill On sweet tea it comes out with no ice. The food was very bland and the chicken parmigiana had a \"slice\" of melted cheese on top. This place is VERY pricey for the food you receive after claiming to be authentic Italian food, when clearly it is not! 
The bread was also cold and hard. 

My advice: Steer clear of this place if you are looking for decent food!"}
{"text":"EHE. Nothing special here. Food was mediocre, as well as the service. Only good thing, and the reason for the 3 stars and not 2, is the Italian margaritas. Disappointed overall."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. I'm not sure what's all the hype about it.  We had the cheese bread which is good but the spaghetti was just okay. All four of us had upset stomachs after eating the meatballs. We all agreed they had a funny taste. Even my youngest child who I swear is part spaghetti and meatballs didn't finish for the first time ever. Probably will never go back again."}
{"text":"Stuffy, old and out dated decor. Capet needs updating as there was a musty smell about the place. The food was below average as the fettuccine Alfredo was over cooked which made the pasta gummy and the sauce was far from smooth. The chicken Parmesan was burnt on the edges and the sauce was not flavorful. Went here to use a Groupon, but, we will not go back. Babbo's has much better Italian food."}
{"text":"Our server Jarrett was awesome, attentive, enthusiastic and overall made the experience a happy one. The food was delicious and the family friendly atmosphere is always a plus the Buca"}
{"text":"The Best salad I've ever tasted could have and should have made my meal of it!!  The chopped Antipasto Salad full of pepperoni, pepperoncini peppers, diced tomatoes, and cucumbers!  Salad heaven!  Can't say as much for the featured Lobster Ravioli!  Bland and almost no flavor but my server was great even on a busy night.  They said it was a new dish on a trial basis I say foggedaboudit!!  Stick with your baseball size meatballs and tasty lasgana. I'll try other Bucca's since this one got me started!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food with a side of shadiness.

I went here only because I had family in town and they wanted to have dinner here. 

The food was OK, very overpriced but half decent. I am not a huge fan of the whole \"family style\" dishes where they are meant for sharing. My finance is a vegetarian, i am a meat eater... see the problem?

So we end up paying nearly 70 dollars when all is said and done. Not outrageous but for that price I would have picked an authentic Italian restaurant. 

So a number of days later my finance is checking his CC statement and somehow our 70 meal turned into a 140 dollar charge! We drove over to the restaurant and spoke directly to the manager. He was able to confirm the server had \"somehow\" given herself a 70 dollar tip. The manager said he would take care of this and call us when he did a little investigating.  

After a few days the manager said somehow the server had \"accidentally\" switched the tip and the total amount up. I have worked in food service before and I don't even know how that is possible. The manager said they would reverse the charge but corporate needed to do this and could take up to 2 weeks. Two weeks is an awfully long time to wait for a mistake, their mistake, to be corrected. 

Eventually the charge was corrected but the company never reached out to apologize or try to make it right. That right there sealed the fact that I would never return to this location or any of their others. 

If for some reason you decide to eat here keep your receipt just in case the server makes a \"mistake\"."}
{"text":"Waiter named Aaron forgot the straws after he brought out the drinks. Said he would get them. Then came back to take our order, still didn't bring them. Came back again to give us the garlic bread, still didn't bring them, so my mom asked.
We ordered spaghetti and pizza.
The spaghetti came out, 20-30 minutes later. But no pizza. It's only going to take a few more minutes, he said. Fifteen minutes go by and he comes back and says, the guy in the kitchen is cutting it up, I'm going to bring it right out. Another fifteen minutes later, Aaron comes out with a burnt pizza and apologizes, because he thought it was done but it wasn't. 
Um, it's more than done. It's burnt.
Why he still took out a pizza that was obviously black is beyond me.
But aside from that, he generally did not seem that friendly or that he even cared that much.
Terrible experience overall."}
{"text":"If you have 30 hours to waste then eating here would be the place to go. We were the first to be seated and the last to get our food. Only ordered 2 dishes and an appetizer. The food was good, I don't know if it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"So there I was, waiting for my family with my husband in the parking lot, checking the Yelp! reviews for this place while I waited. Honestly, due to all the bad reviews, I was quite apprehensive about eating here. When my family arrived, my mom and stepdad assured me that they had eaten here and that it was quite good, so that made me feel a little bit better.

The hostess led us into the kitchen, beginning a tour of the restaurant. At first I was a bit confused when she said, \"Follow me,\" and we ended up in the kitchen a few seconds later. Really? I mean a tour is nice and all, but I was HOWNGREH by this point and just wanted to sit down. Not hungry, HOWNGREH. Thankfully, the tour was mercifully short and we were led into a room filled with framed black and white photos of Italians and Italian-Americans, famous and non-famous, posters of movies starring Sophia Loren, paintings of the Pope, and not to be outdone, Christmas lights and Botticelli-style sculptures of naked women with G-strings painted on them. And of course, the traditional red-and-white checkered table spreads clothed the tables. Man, was I happy to see those tablecloths when we finally sat down.

So we ordered sangria for the whole table and chowed down on some garlic bread as music from La Rosa, Sinatra and the like played on the speakers. At one point one of us looked up and noticed that the ceiling had been lined with rows upon rows of wine bottles. Pretty neat!

I ordered the cheese manicotti, which I've never had before. I'm just gonna tell it like it is: the portions were un-fucking-believable. We ended up having to share each other's dishes, the portions were THAT huge. I gave my husband a couple of my manicotti. These gave me the satisfaction that ravioli does not. Well, since we were full we skipped on dessert, and as we were walking out past the bar, another staff member had us read a humorous little anecdote on the wall called The Italian Who Went to Malta (picture provided).

So... why does this place get so much hate? The service wasn't a problem. Our waitress, Sam, was friendly and quite chatty, and checked on us frequently. The food is amazeballs. The wait can be a little epic, but this isn't fast food. I think the bad reviews mostly come from people who don't understand Italian culture. It's vibrant, it's loud and it's passionate! I know because I have Italian family and Italian ancestry. Of course it can be loud, it's a family place. Of course the wait's long, any legit respectable chefs take pride in their cooking, especially if it's Italian food. But we wouldn't have it any other way. This is quality time for families and we like to have fun and converse between courses.

In conclusion, THIS is Italian cuisine and Italian culture done right. I want to go back and will recommend this place to anybody looking for some authentic Italian culture and food, because this is it.

A mangiare!"}
{"text":"My family and I always come to Buca when we want a great Italian meal! This restaurant is great for couples as well as big groups because they serve a lot of food, very big portions. One order can serve up to 3 or 4 people. 

When my family and I go to Buca we always order the chicken alfredo, chicken parm and pasta marinera. We are a big family and like the variety! The chicken alfredo is soo delicious and creamy, the chicken is cooked so well and the the sauce is a classic. The Chicken parm comes in a big dish of 4 well sized chicken breasts and tastes better then it looks! We get the pasta marinera to eat with the chicken parm because it does not come with any pasta.

I have not had any desserts at this restaurant but I have heard that they are also very yummy! 

Come with a starving belly and leave full and happy! 

Wonderful place to come with friends or family.."}
{"text":"The okay:
The food was decent, albeit extremely overpriced. EXTREMELY. $24 for a 2-person portion of chicken, with nothing on the side? Seriously? Ridiculous. 

The good: 
Our server (bigger guy with long hair) was awesome and very good at dealing with 10 people who needed to eat and be out in 1 hour. He gets 5/5. 
The manager I spoke to today was pleasant. Gave me the impression that he is used to handling Snottsdale people with kid gloves.

The reasons we will not return: 

I would advise the owner to check out their booking practices, and perhaps do some drug testing on their employees.   

1) My friend made a reservation and we were supposed to have the pope room.
My boyfriend and I arrived first and were at the bar when a manager (who skeeved me OUT) came up to tell us that they had \"accidentally\" double booked the room and we were being bumped to a table in the regular dining room. My friend was NOT pleased but we rolled with it. 

I then Yelped the place, and discovered multiple other reviews of people being 'double booked' out of the pope room. I think they are intentionally doing this bait-and-switch 'double booking' thing, because by the time you get there and they tell you the mistake, no way are you going to take your entire party of 10+ people and try to find another restaurant at 6pm on a Friday. They can smash as many large parties in as possible that way. Clever, clever.

2) We tried to cash out, and the bartender had disappeared. When he returned, his face was bright red and he was sniffling. Boyfriend and I exchanged one look and simultaneously muttered \"Cokehead\". This was confirmed when he ran our card for $147 instead of just our 2 drinks. He reversed it, but the charge still went through to the bank.... because we got hit with multiple overdraft fees today, as we had used the card for several other transactions that night. Now we have to argue with Wells Fargo about this. I know, people make mistakes, yada yada, but had this guy not just obviously done a line in the back, he likely would not have made that mistake."}
{"text":"Last nights visit to Buca was less than I expect from this restaurant. First, we had reservations for 7:30 I checked in, the hostess barely acknowledge us. I expect she was a stand in as later another hostess took over and we were seated. Then  the problem started. We ordered a bottle of wine and two draft beers. Waiter returned to tell us the tap was dry on our option of beer would we like another option. (well first its Friday night how do you run out of Bud Light at 7:30 on Friday night) -- then we were told they had Miller light on Draft..... 15 min later ....know miller light was out (Friday night). Dan (our server was the king of excuses). Then he offered Coors light.... (but said if we don't have that what do you want from the bottle). I stated bring me a Bottle of Bud Light and a list of what is in stock. Got the  first Bud light after Salads had arrived and we were on the second helping. We asked for bread... 15 min later it arrives (I kid you not). He took our entree order and second round of drinks. The food was fine. The drink issues ran all night. The service was awful. The table beside us turned twice while we sat an waited for various items. This was my son in laws birthday. TOOK 30 min for his ice cream / happy birthday song to arrive. Dan was in the weeds all night ... no one really helped him. We were very disappointed. $158.13 bill for four-- sorry I expect much better service! Did I say we didn't even leave the restaurant until 10:30pm 3 hours for a simple order. Oh and on the way out, I notice the tap, BUD LIGHT proud as you please....someone just didn't want to change the keg. Really?"}
{"text":"We come here every time we stay at Excalibur .
 It's perfect for the family without having to go to fast food restaurants. This trip we had our best Waiter yet. his name was Chris. He was nice to us and nice to my 7 year old son which is always appreciated. Food near me which it always is and great portions."}
{"text":"So slow!!! I tought this place would be more of a  authentic fresh italian food restaurant. Pizza hut has better pasta!! So dissapointed"}
{"text":"It's upstairs from the Casino in Excalibur and as soon as my wife said \"I will never stay or eat at Excalibur\" I knew I had to make it happen.  She loves Italian and we've had Buca before in Kansas City and in Orlando.  So it was an easy sell and we weren't disappointed.  

You come here for the staples - antipasto salad and spaghetti with meatballs.  The drinks were pedestrian (expected) the bartender was obnoxious (entertaining) and the service was frenetic (it isn't CUT people).  All that said we got what we ordered in a timely fashion and it was really good.  It was the cheapest meal I've had in Vegas in like 10 years and very satisfying.

You don't come here for your big meal out if you are expecting great service and a romantic dinner.  Do that somewhere else.  Do this because you are hungry and don't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"One word. MEATBALL.

If you crave a gigantic meatball this is the place for you. Never have I seen such a large ball of meat on a plate, just waiting to be divided up and partitioned to the dinner guests at the table. 

The meatball and I, played a coy game of flirting back and forth, I tried a few other dishes first, the anti-pasto salad, Fresh green beans, the stuff shells, the lemon chicken, all which were very good. Then, the meatball decided to seduce me with it's sauce, and I wasn't able to resist. 

Was it the best meatball I've ever had in my life? No, (see my review of Pasto's) I even make a better meatball (turkey, bison, or beef, you take your pick) I just appreciate the sheer mass of meat they use, and their sauce was sweet and a bit tangy, just right for meat, terrible on pasta I would imagine.

Overall this place has \"chain\" character, but is not authentic in anyway. The menu is so unhealthy it took some creative mixing of side dishes for me to even get close to a \"well balanced meal.\" However, for a fun family event, or evening with friends, I like the way this restaurant forces you to interact and share dishes with each other.  It makes the dinner experience more engaging than simply ordering your own dish and eating in a silo. 

If I could I'd give the place 3.5 stars, I will let the Yelp aggregate my rating with the others, perhaps this place can climb to 3.5 stars someday."}
{"text":"We ducked in here after shopping the Old Town area of Scottsdale. So happy we did. The menu is full of wonderful treats, not the least of which is the antipasto, almost a meal by itself. Our main dish was tasty and served hot from the stove. Have to say, the experience with our server Alli, made the meal. Checked on our group of 3 throughout the meal; very attentive and friendly. Always a pleasure to have good food AND good service. Explore the menu and enjoy the casual atmosphere. Nice evening break and tasty offerings."}
{"text":"Great place for good food at a decent price.

Servings are huge...if you are coming with only 1-2 people, you're best to just buy one entree or pasta plate and maybe an appetizer or dessert if you want to bring food home (or have extras).

Had the spicy chicken Rigatoni and it was excellent.  Tons of food and tons of flavor!

The bread/oil/vin they serve is excellent as well.  No idea why, but it is just delicious.

Also ordered the calamari but it wasn't earth shattering..I'd probably skip it next time.

Server was great and very helpful.  Atmosphere is very \"homey\" and has a classic feel.

Check it out if you are thinking Olive Garden for dinner."}
{"text":"DO NOT order with Postmates.   I don't know if the food is good because after the 45 minutes or took them to make my food and 30 minutes from that point, my order still hadn't been picked up.  However, if you're going to take advantage of new technology,  you need to work with it.   I expected to wait for my food,  but the time estimate was 40 minutes.... Not an hour and a half."}
{"text":"My family went there three times. The fist time after a 40 minute wait, they brought the wrong food. The second was my grandmothers birthday, we made reservations and they were going to serve us a birthday cake- after being seated 30 minutes late, they forgot to defrost the cake- causing us to wait another hour after they served us food for it to arrive. They gave us a $100 gift card to make up for it. The third time we went to use the gift card, and the waitress spilled scalding hot coffee in both my parents. They gave us three free cannolis   To apologize but did not comp any part of the bill. Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"Update note:  

The Daily Meal on 4/26/2016 named Buca di Beppo as one of top 15 Italian Restaurants in the country.  http://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/america-s-12-best-italian-restaurant-chains-slideshow/slide-6"}
{"text":"Man, do I love this place.

Sure, its campy motif is over-the-top, and Buca IS a chain restaurant, but I'm not above going to a chain when the food is good and plentiful, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and I can host huge parties and no one will yell.

The family-style dining is the big draw for me, though it can get a little tricky in big groups, so be sure to warn diners to bring cash to make things easier.  The sharing is caring idea makes the meal more personal, and adds some extra fun to the meal, especially in a big group.  Comments like \"Hey, try this chicken,\" or \"this lasagna is delicious, have some\" fly all over the place as everyone tastes a portion of what others have selected.  And they can do that without depleting the dish, since the servings are ginormous - a \"small\" portion will serve 2-4 people!

Must-haves: their Gorgonzola Salad (apples, cranberries, walnuts & gorgonzola, YUM); their garlic bread (not yo mama's); the Chicken Saltimbocca with prosciutto and artichokes; and their good ol' Spaghetti Marinara.

For dessert, there's the Dolce Sampler, which has all kinds of stuff on it, but it's kind of expensive, so I recommend their Tiramisu - a four serving bowl of the luscious dessert, made with 5 oz. of rum, so if you're eating a lot of it, it really has a kick!  Side note: like Johnny Mango, which I previously reviewed, Buca has a frequent diner club, managed by email.  They'll send seasonal coupons ($10 or 10% off, etc.) and a free dessert coupon for your birthday.  I still have some tiramisu left in the freezer from my birthday last week, which I will promptly go finish after my mid-night Yelp-a-thon. 

One of my favorite rooms in this place is the Pope room, a large room in the back of the restaurant with a huge round table which seats up to 18.  There's a lazy suzan in the middle for spinning food around to each other (with a pope bust in the middle - a tiny bit creepy, but you get used to it, ha), and with the arched ceiling, the acoustics in there sometimes makes it sound like the person across from you is sitting right next to you, even when you whisper.  Bizarre, but fun.

Overall, a great place for a night out with a group of friends - and if you bring enough people, the complimentary chef's hats and Buca di Beppo pocket protectors (yep, that's what I said) will appear, which make for some ridiculous photos.  Godd times."}
{"text":"A lot of tiny bugs flying around! Not pleasant to eat with . Found a hair in the pasta somehow and the Bucca Bella tasted and looked totally different than the description. Staff was nice but not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! The waiter was a complete moron and a liar. I asked him about cheese being in certain dishes due to dietary issues. He told us the spicy chicken rigatoni only had a little parmesean sprinkled on top amd the garlic bread was cheese free. The bread came out slathered in melted cheese. The sauce on the pasta was also super cheesy. I called him out on it, especially after he told the next table about the cheese. He lied and said there were three kinds of garlic bread, but did not explain why he got us a cheesy one when we told him we did not want cheese. I then pointed out what he said to the table next to us. He could not explain lying to us. He acted and looked very unprofessional. Don't trust a man with a giant hole in his ear and knuckle tattoos. The manager came out and comped our meal. Would not go back. Food was not good."}
{"text":"This is a very sad moment for me, because this is the first one star I have given to any restaurant. However, as sad as it is, it can not be avoided. My boyfriend and I have been coming to this Buca di Beppo for a while now, and every time we come the service gets progressively worse. Yesterday, he decided to take me out as a surprise dinner date. 

Upon arriving, we were seated the the waitress came to our table to take our order. We ordered our drinks and ordered the pasta that we love so much, the Penne Arrabiata. After we ordered the waitress gave us an attitude and look as if saying, \"is that really all you're going to order?\" We just smiled at her politely, and eventually she went to put our order in. Although it did seem kind of rude, we just brushed it off because they were pretty busy that day.

One of the things we love most about Buca is the bread. After placing our order, we waited patiently for our bread. Sadly, it never came. We saw that same waitress bring bread and attend to everyone else's table but out own. The only time she came by our table was to bring out our actual meal. The penne arrabiata was good as always, but sadly not even that can make me give this place any higher of a rating. 

Besides the lack of bread, our cups of water needed to be refilled and not once did she come by to check on us. I even made eye contact with her a few times and tried to get her attention, but she never stopped by our table to check on anything. My boyfriend, who was at the edge of the booth even drank all of his water and placed it at the edge of the table to see if anyone would notice, but no one did. 

Sadly, the dinner at Buca was definitely one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. I will just have to find a new one to go to."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our 3rd anniversary here. Growing up in a big (loud) Italian family Bucca made me feel right at home. I love waling through the kitchen to get to your table, the family style dining, the music, and the artwork. Thank you for making our evening so special!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent, prices not so much. As I understand, it is family style. But what if not everyone wants the same thing? Then pay a ridiculous amount for a single serving? The drinks and salads are also soooo pricey. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I don't understand the low rating here! Are people going to the same place? Are you expecting the best most authentic Italian food in the world? This place was awesome. I got four ish star American style Italian food for a decent price. I say decent as everything is super sized here. I recommend going with a group of people as even the kid's meal is toddler sized (as in big as a toddler). Take someone here on a date and you'll really get to know that individual as sharing is caring. Whatever you do don't order a meal for yourself thinking you can finish a small because you cannot! I had the cheese ravioli and for someone that isn't a red sauce fan, I was impressed. Also their white sangria is A1. Also, also, try their mozzarella garlic bread as it's pretty game changing. Beyond that as I don't eat beef or pork I skipped a lot of the menu. The staff are nice and I'm just convinced that people who give this place a low review don't understand the concept and or what they've gotten themselves into. Family style means being your family. As someone who hates Olive Garden, I prefer this place."}
{"text":"I'm truly astonished at the amount of negative reviews for Buca!  I've had nothing but excellent service and great food at this place.  This place, hands down, has the best caesar salad I've ever had in my life (100% serious).   
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of taking a chunk out of my life savings to pay for a dinner bill for 3 people, but I've always left painfully full with a large bag of leftovers.

It doesn't have the warm, hole-in-the-wall Italian ristorante thing going on, but the atmosphere is still very welcoming and I love that for large parties, you have your own private section.   Each room has it's own theme and you can stare at the walls all night and still find something you missed before.  Anyone who is unhappy with the wall decor was evidently not seated in the room with the pope head because if that's not class to you, I don't want to know you.  
Perhaps those decorating needs would be better met at a faux-posh restaurant with paintings and wall decor that looks strikingly similar to the Big Lots Home Accents section like they have at The Olive Garden (which is still super delicious by the way). 

Seriously with the food though, definitely on my top 10 list of death row meals.  I could totally go down with their Veal Parmesan making itself a coffin out of my stomach."}
{"text":"HI have heard great things about the one in the Bay area so I wondered if this one would live up to the hype. Boy did it ever. 
The \"small\" portion was huge as it's family style but I made my best effort to finish what I could because it was amazing. 
My pesto sauce was fresh, flavorful and just delicious. My son ravaged his rigatoni and my daughter and husband devoured a pizza with the thickest layer of fresh cheese you have ever seen.

I will be craving their food until we get a chance to return again. 

Soooo good! 

Our server was also so attentive and informative. They took very good care of us. Nothing about our visit deserved anything less than five stars. 
Bravo!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go with family! Get the lemon caper chicken!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experince of my life! I normally dont say that but this experince cost me 49 dollars and a worst night possible. Took mother for dinner at 8pm. Ordered at 830, food arrived at 926pm. He order was supposed to be pork free products, like sausage, pepp or anything but she brings in the TWO seperate orders with sausage when mom is alergic to it. Thanks. Dont recomment at all!!!"}
{"text":"One word---Terrible!!! 
We just came from dinner there and were extremely disappointed. This was my first experience at the restaurant and I was far from impressed. 
From the get go it was quite shady and unprofessional. We called about 20 minutes ahead of arriving and asked what the wait time was. We were told about 20 minutes so decided to head in. 
When we got there, there was no wait and we were seated in the empty bar table area. We had never been to this location and didn't even realize there was another section to the restaurant. Our \"server\" was actually the bartender. While she was nice, it appeared that she cared more about increasing our bill instead of our experience. i.e when we asked if it comes with bread the server asked if we wanted garlic or traditional, knowing full well that there was complimentary bread but wanted to charge so the bill was higher (she only mentioned that it's complimentary after we said no to their ~$10 bread on the menu, which she pointed to). In addition, our beers arrived extremely large (at least 750cc to 1L). She never mentioned that there were two sizes and just gave us the larger, more expensive beers (the bill mentioned almost $10 each!!). 
We received our $24 entree within less than five minutes of ordering it (somebody said microwave). It was large and a decent size for two, however was not very tasty and was a bit cold after few bites. After our entree had been on the table for about ten minutes, we received our beers. Ten minutes after that we got complimentary bread and waters. Definitely not how the order of service is supposed to go :(
The bar area was extremely cold to the point that we couldn't even finish our beers. When we got up to go to the restroom we realized that there was a much larger, warmer and vivid area (we were the only people at the bar at this point). We should have been asked if we wanted to sit in the bar area or the main dining area and since it was our first time we just assumed the bar was the main restaurant. 
We never saw our \"server\" at our table for the rest of the evening. She just yelled from across the bar if we wanted desert or the check. She dropped the check and never came to pick it up. After waiting more than ten minutes we went to the bar and paid because we could not sit freezing any longer. 
It was terrible and we will not go back."}
{"text":"Horrible. Took 90 minutes. He said it was cause holidays but everyone else that came in after us g it served. Good came out cold. Never again!"}
{"text":"Never again for this location. I like the chain, the decor, the food. However, we did have a big group but our server was so disorganized and made promises like more water and never getting it back to us or bread. I don't know how many times Lydia had to complain but it was more times than she brought anything to our table. We came in at 5pm, we left at 830 this is not because we were chit chatting but checkout took 30 minutes food from order to delivery was about an hour and 15 minutes. If you value your time you will get take out or go somewhere else. Did I mention my food was cold?"}
{"text":"I found a FINGER NAIL CLIPPING in my iced tea... and all I got was a nonchalant, \"Oh I apologize\",  from the server. Extremely grossed out and disappointed. Never going back here again! There's better Italian food in the area. Try Bravo."}
{"text":"Very desapointed   they took too long to set us them took  way too long to come & get our order was there I. The chair   18 min  we just walk out"}
{"text":"I dunno guys, I still really like their food. My mother wanted to get takeout from here for her birthday dinner today,  so here we came and back home we went. 

We ordered...

Eggplant Parmigiana-Usually I can take or leave this dish, but their version is a keeper. The eggplant itself is fluffy yet a little crispy and is topped with excellent cheese and sauce.

Spaghetti With Meatballs-You almost don't need the pasta as their meatballs are garlic-packed asteroids of rich meatiness. They seem to have only gotten larger  and even better since my last visit. 

Shrimp Fra Diavolo-This was creamy and mildly spicy with small shrimp to be found amongst the rigatoni. Yes, we were dealing with the Devil's Shrimp, but he'd have to be feelin' pretty peaceful 'n easy to indulge in this. 

We also got  the Chopped Antipasto Salad with that brilliant vinaigrette and the Mozzarella Garlic Bread which I'd love to put a gooey, dripping-with-sauce meatball between two slices of. 

I cannot say anything negative about the service here either. I don't think I waited more than five minutes for everything, and everyone was very mindful of me, making sure I was being taken care of and all. 

It may be a chain, but draw the word IMPRESSED on my stomach. They are a contender."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to dine here on Wednesday January 3, 2018. Seated immediately and told that Tre would be our server. Had to wait 10 minutes until he made his first appearance. Ordered a large shrimp parmigiana figuring we'd have left overs to take home. It's supposed to feed up to 5 people. Barely enough for 2. Ordered iced tea as our beverage. No ice in them. Had to wait a long time to get refills on them or a glass of ice to make the tea cold. In fact, we had to wait a long time for EVERYTHING. Tre was far from attentive and as slow as a turtle. He was close to nonexistent service wise. The shrimp in the dish were overcooked and fried WAY too long. 75% were very brown from overcooking. Buca uses a lot of sauce to cover up this problem and hopes that the guests don't notice it. Parmigiana cheese on the dish? Nope. Barely there. Not an enjoyable meal. Need to reconsider dining here again. Didn't get a lot for the money we spent. 2 thumbs down for this place."}
{"text":"The main reason for 5 stars is because I was given perfect advice on what to order.  I called in to order for 8 adults and 4 kids.  I had no idea what size to order for the dishes that I wanted.  The person who answered my call told me what to order, I did, and it was perfect.  Just a small dish of leftovers.  We ordered baked ziti, spaghetti with meat sauce and garlic bread.  It tasted great and nobody complained about dinner.  Every single person ate a healthy plate.
When I came to pick it up at the time I requested, it was ready and the take out process was smooth.
I would highly recommend for a large group - and every time I have eaten in, I have been very happy with the food and service."}
{"text":"The coziest Italian restaurant! I love it like crazy. 

The Pizza Angelo is amazing, although different. The Calamari is made just right, in my opinion, the marinara sauce that comes with the calamari is even better than the marinara that is topped on the spaghetti. Maybe it's the spicy taste. The Tiramisu is very \"rum\"ified. The Cheese Cannoli is great in a comfort food way. The garlic mozzarella bread is so good, you might just want to eat it all night. The salads aren't all that amazing, just salad. 

The waiters and waitresses are very pleasant. So.. the decor can be overwhelming for some folks, but for others (like myself), it's immediately lovable. A good suggestion is to come with a group, or at least 3 peeps. That way, you can taste more varieties without taking home leftovers (not that is it bad). Overall, this is a restaurant I go to at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Why is their spaghetti so damn watery? Did they hire my old high school cafeteria lady to work in the kitchen?

The waitress was awesome though. She had tons of personality and seemed like a hard worker.

The meatballs are amazing, but wish the spaghetti was worth eating with them.

Word of advice: if you are a Costco member, go across the street to Costco and buy a $100 Buca Di Beppo gift card for $80. And use a coupon on top of that. Easiest way to safe money here.....because my dinner for the wife and kids was like $130 and somehow it didn't seem worth it."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness; I wanted to like this place, other ppl say it's good but... no. Just no. The interior is a maze winding through a plethora of faux- stucco rooms with tons and tons (and tons) of kitschy random junk on the walls and nooks and shelves in a poor attempt to make it look 'authentic' or 'immigrant' Italian. It just seemed creepy/dirty/tacky. Sitting at a table looking into a nook, one could see dust and dead bugs. Waitstaff coughing... and food was definitely not great. Bread was like loaf bread and the olive oil/vinegar mixture tasted sour. Food is served family style - several ppl to a dish. We got stuffed shells which the menu boasted of sausage, etc.  It was puréed - like this unidentifiable baby poop goop. I was only able to eat the pasta shell; my stomach was literally turning - it was all just very gross and seemed super unsanitary. 

We did try the brussel sprout/prosciutto side and that was the one redeeming thing of the entire visit, but not enough to save the experience. 

Just ick. Felt dirty and old - including restroom. We don't be back; should have went to Olive Garden; not a fan of chains but it would have been better than Buca."}
{"text":"Our St. Valentine's Day Wedding Dinner was held at Buca di Beppo. We had invited 40+ people to have the 5 course \"Glorioso\" dinner. 
We met with Jacqueline and had a private taste -testing in December, and Shelby called us in early February to confirm all details. 
Both Shelby and Jacqueline were extremely kind and professional-they really know how to set up an excellent dinner! Even though the restaurant was very busy, we had a private room for our guests and the food kept coming! Hot, fresh and scrumptious! We received many compliments on the quality and taste of the different menu items, and all of our guests were very pleased, and and very full! 
We especially appreciate that we were allowed to substitute an entree for an appetizer- it was a wise decision because everyone LOVED the lasagna! 
We are making this restaurant a family tradition and will be back very soon! 
Thank you SO much Buca! 
You made our wedding dinner Terrific!!
 AAAAA+++++ :) :) :)"}
{"text":"Jarrett was the man!!!! He recommended exactly what I was looking for in the menu. Great service, will come back :)"}
{"text":"Arrived at 4:50 PM on Thanksgiving (which I had made a reservation) for the turkey dinner. They told us they had run out of turkey. I was not happy but sat down to choose something else. I asked to see the manager. the manager was able to accommodate our turkey dinner after talking with the chef. 
Excellent stuffing and mashed potatoes. I was pleased that the manager took the time to save our Thanksgiving dinner plans. Please cook more turkey next time guys."}
{"text":"I hate to do this...I just hate to...but I have never experienced this before. I don't know if I can ever return to Buca. Firstly, I knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived. She just seemed...off...or high. She was very awkward and kept flirting with my date. Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. 

To make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. 

Alas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. 

She literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here! I was happy to leave, and planned to never return. That woman just creeped me out. Sorry Buca, a previous visit was much better than this one."}
{"text":"I saw another review this place as great, so I had to weigh in.  It's crap.  I wish I liked it, but I can't imagine have any worse Italian food.  I would rather just have a bowl or cereal at home.  If you want food without flavor, this is your place.

I guess the building is cool looking from the outside...just don't venture in!  I hate being such a downer, but we all need fair warning."}
{"text":"Recently catered my mother's 80th birthday party and the service was awesome and the food was delicious! The management and staff met my every request. Thank you for helping us make mom\"s celebration awesome!"}
{"text":"This 5 star review mainly is due to great customer service! Don't get me wrong, the food here is GREAT as well, but our waitress Michele was worth the time to write a review on Yelp for their business. Even while dealing with an unruly (though obviously special needs patron) at another table, Michele kept her cool and was very helpful and friendly throughout our meal. Waitstaff work very hard and people should recognize this more often. Especially when I watched what Michele had to go through with the unruly customer! Way to go Michele! Thanks for the drink!"}
{"text":"Chaos!  I ordered on line thinking it would make the process of getting dinner more efficient.  My pick up was scheduled for 5:15 but I was running late.  So got here at 5:30.  It is now past 6 and I'm still waiting for my order .  Service is horrible"}
{"text":"My husband and I are here staying at Excalibur and had planned on eating at Buca for one meal. Italian food is one of our favorites! This is our 2nd time eating here. We had a great experience last time and really enjoyed the food.  It is also my husband's birthday today! We planned on ordering big and enjoying some Italian food! We ordered a small family style baked ziti, a small family style stuffed chicken,and a small family style bread. Our server was really nice and attentive, but I wish he would of brought the food out to us as well. There was a different young man who brought us our food. This young man made it a point to  \"wish us luck\" for ordering such a large amount of food. It was embarrassing and put a damper on the meal. My husband and I really enjoy the food here, but we feel that management should encourage their staff not to patronize customers, but to encourage customers to enjoy their selections. It's common to indulge when on vacation, and I doubt the Buca corporation would be happy hear that employees are discouraging vacationers for indulging on their wonderful entrees. By the way the food was excellent. We ate almost everything and took a small amount in a to go container back to the room for later!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Was here with my Girlfriend and she brought me here to celebrate Veterans Day because I am a Veteran. The staff was outstanding and the meal was Delicious."}
{"text":"One word: disappointed. I ordered the most simple dish, spaghetti and meat balls, and the sauce tasted like it came out of a can. It really tasted like they opened up a can of diced tomatoes and poured it on top and it also was sweet, as if they added sugar. The meat balls were generous in size but was not an Italian meat ball. It just had no flavor, seasoning, or Italian spices to it! This is not a good place to eat at if you want real Italian food. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food even for vegetarians, towards closing during happy hour in the bar service by Eddie was excellent.He remembered everything even our to go order."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. Service can a bit missing even though the place was not crowded. Food was alright. I had better Buca food somewhere else."}
{"text":"We loved the food! - Service and seating not so good...

First the food!: 
- We ordered the Mixed Green Salad with fresh lettuce blend tossed with the signature Italian vinaigrette, red onions, pepperoncini peppers and black and green olives.*
*Spice up your salad with prosciutto and Gorgonzola cheese. Terrific!  
-We split the Chick en Cannelloni Pasta tubes stuffed with chicken, spinach, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses with a hint of lemon zest and nutmeg, baked on a bed of rosa sauce. Delicious!! Couldn't get enough.  
The meal came with bread and butter.  
-Definintely great food this visit.  We will be back to try other dishes.

Second, the annoying parts:
 - Went on a Saturday evening and with no wait time at all, we were directed to a booth up on the third floor (the hostess was kind enough to point out the restrooms on the second floor through the kitchen because I'd never have guessed). Once we sat on the seat we realized this was a broken seat and moved over to a booth that was a bit more comfortable. They need to go over the dinning areas and spruce up the seating and some of the little details of comfort. Third floor was loud and noisy with everyone trying to hear and talk over the other customers (ugg!).
-our waiter was a 'just there' good old boy.  Nice, but not at all attentive nor did he really understand wine ordering.  We did not get any water, and we had ordered a 9 oz. craft of wine and had to wait until we were half done eating to get a 'Bottle' of wine!.  We told him we didn't order a bottle but a craft and I watched from my seat while he poured the whole bottle into a huge glass craft which was not even on the menu!  By now we had completed over half of our meal and were dying of thirst so we simply poured out 2 glasses of wine and had him take back the rest. 

Overall we enjoyed the meal and will go back but try for a different spot to eat, and make sure we point to the menu for everything we are ordering, and ask for water First Thing!~"}
{"text":"Walk thru kitchen is cool,Very different there is seating in the kitchen unique. Small plate easily feeds two people, lasagna was delicious best I've had so far!! Garlic bread is fresh and tasteful not over powering.  Cannoli's great better than chompies. Not heavily loaded with chocolate chips which I liked, but 3 for $10 feel a bit pricey. Great meal,great service. Definitely  will be back!! Come hungry or with friends/family"}
{"text":"If I knew how to give 1/2 star I would.  Terrible, unprofessional, no customer service at all.  Tonight was my brother in law and sisters 20th wedding anniversary.  The choice was Buca Di PEPPO was their choice, WHAT A MISTAKE.  Dinner reservation for 7 p.m. for a table due to a broken hand ,we're not honored.  We were seated at a booth.  When the seating arrangements were addressed the hostess presented an attitude of a BOOTH IS ALL WE HAVE!    The family was given a table after the family member presented her handicap.  The hostess did not even present menus. 
The family waited 50 minutes at the table with no beverages (water/tea) and house bread.  The table with 10 to 12 persons was waited on diligently, might I note they were caucasions, married, young and old.
Long story short, we left Buca Di PEPPO and walked across the parking lot to Texas Road house.
Keep it up Buca, restuarants rely in CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 9 and it was 15 minute wait. Our waiter Jarrett was awesome, great attitude and knowledgeable on the menu. Food was awesome!! Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"We usually enjoy the food but hard to get into the price structure. They often have coupons to lessen the blow. First time we went packed lately was dead in there."}
{"text":"First time coming here and as soon as I walked in the restaurant smelled funny, the waiter was nice and attended us, but the food was not as good and the price for it was not even worth it."}
{"text":"I usually love Bucca di Beppo but was sorely disappointed tonight. Called in for take out and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. Got there and waited another 20 minutes. Got home to find a salad with no dressing so useless (called to have it take off the bill which they said they would do), cold chicken limone (probably because we also ordered baked ziti which was a bit warmer and they didn't time things with that dish in mind), a side of fettucini alfredo that was tasteless paste that went straight into the trash, and an OK slice of cake. Almost $90 dinner. Regret giving the $5 tip. Rigatony's is much better."}
{"text":"The place is charming but i feel that the kitchen gets overwhelmed when the rush hits and there are misteps. We went for Thanksgiving dinner which is a good value at about 55 bucks for 3 people, however it was served room temperature and the waitress forgot the cranberry sauce, so we had to flag her doin the bar and the bartender was talking so loud it was distracting. The feel is a bit like Oregano's, but with big expensive family portions, so be ready to split menu items, and take a doggy bag home. The host has a spiel about walking through the kitchen that plays like a broken record if you sit near the entrance. They are open on holidays which is a plus, and probably the only time we will go there."}
{"text":"Buca is a more traditional Italian restaurant. We love it here because the food is probably the most authentic were going to find in Charlotte. The meals are huge its family style so everything is shareable. I love the deco of the restaurant some very interesting pics. All pastas are to die for the salads are pretty basic but cost about 13.oo dollars minimum. The masalas I tried it out Saturday it was very sweet to me but the leftovers on Sunday were great."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Family sized portioned, but it's a little pricey.  The decor is very amusing, especially the pope head on the 2nd floor table.

The chicken parm was good.  Really weird that they served the tiramisu in a big bowl. 

Worth trying out if you haven't been there."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 
To their credit, Buca Di Beppo reached out to me and corrected the mistake. I've updated my star rating as a result. Although this was an unfortunate experience, I'm a big fan of good customer service!

Old Review:
Do NOT buy gift certificates here. I had a family friend give me a $100 gift certificate for Buca di Beppo. We took the family and spent about $60. After a few months we came back for a second visit to use the rest. The server told us the balance on the gift card was zero. She then explained that she has seen fellow servers zero out the remaining balance on gift cards and pay it to themselves as a tip. I brought this up with the manager but he said there was nothing they could do about it. This is the last time I will be going to Buca di Beppo, and again I would not recommend you buy anyone a gift certificate here."}
{"text":"O.K., I know these are chain places but I've always had good food here. The Staff is usually nice but a little over the top in the personality department, like you would expect at the chain places. but I don't know if it's the posters of the stars from the 50's and hot Italian girls on Vespa's that put me in a good mood but I like this place. I love the big square pizza covered in peppercini & pepperoni."}
{"text":"If you like heaping portions and you don't care how it tastes, this crappy fake Italian restaurant is for you."}
{"text":"For a chain I really like this place. 

The atmosphere is very casual, and the food is consistently delicious. This is a great place to go with a large group as they have so many little rooms. The portions are huge so order with care... Location is perfect -- great place to dine before hitting the old town Scottsdale scene later.

Bar area is decent with a reasonable crowd around happy hour."}
{"text":"went for lunch and with 2 people it is the perfect time.  the lunch portions are good for just 1 vs the dinner portion which feeds a city.  had the soup and salad and it was a good size.  the minestroni was hearty and a touch of kick to it.  the salad was the size of a side salad and i liked to olives.  it was just $6!  would go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bit older and could use some carpet and flooring updates, but it really adds to the feeling that the place is something you would find in a little Italy section of any city. The ravs are great, not overdone and are filled with the right amount of cheese. The chicken parm was nice and crispy and well seasoned, but could have been flattened a bit more for us. The pomodoro sauce could have used some more garlic and salt, it was a bit bland. You will not be dissatisfied by eating at Bucca.  Go with a large group and request the Pope's table, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Its been maybe 7+ years since I last visited and I always remembered this as a distinctly average place with a cutesy decor. 

However the food here was so bad tonight (Christmas eve) that is unlikely that I will ever return again. I've had better Italian food at an Olive Garden. 

The \"mouse trap\" which brought the family into this mediocre establishment after all these years was a Bucca $50 gift card given to me by a business associate. 

After reviewing the menu it struck that prices here seemed sky high - even considering the family style platters. Most pasta dishes averaged $20 for a small plate and $30+ for a large. The selections are all the typical Ameri-Italian fare you might expect - chicken parm, spaghetti and meatballs, Marsala, etc 

When we were seated we did the obligatory walk through the working kitchen to the dining room - gee what a clever novelty. 

The fact is that if your seeking this type of food experience, the Maggianos chain is far (far) superior to the lousy food being heaped at customers at this crummy restaurant. 

We ordered the the Mozzarella Caprese to start - pretty simple. When the dish arrived we all noticed that the sliced tomatoes all looked rather unripe. These looked AND tasted like the cheap tomatoes you might get on a $2.00 burger at McDonalds - certainly not at a moderately priced sit down restaurant where your average bill for 4 is probably $100 or more. Needless to say the Caprese was a big letdown - low grade olive oil drizzled over pink tomatoes with generous sprinkles of salt & pepper. 

We also ordered the $8 garlic bread basket -another  massive dud appetizer which tasted like the bland & doughy \"assembly line\" French loaves you might get at a Safeway market in a foil bag. Little garlic to be found, stale tasting bread - no one liked it. 

Yelpers let me ask you - even with the supposedly kitschy decor if the food is no good than what is the point? This whole Bucca concept is so cliche with the endless looping Frank Sinatra/ Dean Martin music and goofy photos throughout. 

Why is this place so busy? Mystery! Oy vey this place is like Outback Steakhouse but with Italian food - a genuine mystery, especially with so many wonderful and moderately priced restaurants nearby. What is the draw here? 

Our waiter was Paolo (who was trying mightily to come off debonair) took our orders and his service was adequate. We ordered the chicken parm and a penne with vodka sauce.

When the plates arrived we all found that the chicken was over-breaded (the breading was literally dripping off the sides of the chicken) with a deep fried taste & consistency, way too much gooey cheese and very little sauce. Just plain yuck. 

The penne was just too spicy and too creamy for a rosa sauce - again just meh. 

Total damages with one beer was about $90 including the gratuity.  

What a joke right? No one liked the food and it pretty much ruined our evening. We all talked about the bad experience here for hours after leaving - that is the kind of impression it left.  Even with our $50 gift certificate we all felt like we were taken to the cleaners with the awful food here. 

Why spend big $ here for so-so food when there are a plethora of great places nearby that actually care about serving quality food? 

Note to self - avoid this place at all costs."}

All around the staff was super friendly and The waiter was super helpful when it came to trying new things!! Definitely going back again for more!!"}

{"text":"Jarrett is awesome .. great server with lots of personality . Food is really good and way more than I can eat .. the chianti is delish. You will love it too . Bring the family."}
{"text":"I am absolutely terrible at taking time to let others know about experiences however this one is worth it!  A little over a month ago I went through Natasha and Tiffany to organize my mother's 70th Birthday surprise dinner and they were FANTASTIC!!  They made it incredibly easy communicating with them via email and the fact that I could pre-pay for the event via the internet made it very easy.  When we arrived at the restaurant every single person we engaged with was kind and so sincere with my disabled mom.  They were patient and never let on that 40 of our closest friends and family were waiting in private dining area to surprise her.  They truly helped me do the unthinkable surprise the woman who knows everything!!!  The staff assigned to our party were terrific and there was truly not a detail missed from the arrival to them personally assisting us to our car with the gifts and left overs.  I am telling you what if you are looking to entertain and don't want the mess left in your own home to deal with BUCA IS FLAWLESS!!! This is the second event I've thrown with them and they haven't just won my tummy they have my heart!!! THANK YOU BUCA STAFF!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday night. We were a huge party and probably not the easiest to serve. I've got to say, Robert and his staff were on point the whole night. Everyone was super friendly and were on top of everything. The customer service and the food were both exceptional. I'd give more stars if I could."}
{"text":"With all of the wonderful Italian places to eat in Charlotte. Don't go here. Their sanitation grade is 90. That's not a good sign. I have never been in a restaurant in Charlotte since 1986 that had a lower sanitation grade. I'd be afraid to get sick."}
{"text":"Wish I could of done zero stars, management was a joke & I feel extremely sorry the waitstaff.  Waited over 2 hours to be told it will be another hour!  Happy Mother's Day, Bucca we will never be back to this joke of an establishment..."}
{"text":"Just amazing food and service. Best chopped anti pasta and lasagne. Great gravy.  Toni our server was just as good"}
{"text":"Went there on 10/22/14. Service was nice. Server was nice but so ditsy. Ordered bruschetta. Came out fast, but entrée's came out 50 mins later. Ordered eggplant parmigiana. Tasted burned. Waitress took my credit card and we waited almost 10 minutes for our credit card slip and she was so unorganized."}
{"text":"Cindy in take out was soooo helpful and the food is always great! A great way to enjoy the Oscars!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Had a group of 6 and we all shared a large order of the baked ziti (it says a large feeds 4 or more and all 6 of us didn't even finish it) and 4 of us shared a large order of the chicken parm. Definitely planning on going back again."}
{"text":"Ok, I've never been a fan of this place. I've visited 3 different locations nationally. I came here tonight for my brother in laws birthday. We waited forever to be seated. They were, by no means, busy. Then, they did not have place settings out for us. A young man eventually came and took our drink orders and we explained how we wanted the checks to be split \"that side of the table and the couple over here are separate.\" Then another server came and did the same thing. They young man went to tell her what we ordered and she just said \"I'll do it, again, myself.\" We re-gave the orders and waited about 20 minutes for drinks. The our order was screwed up. Again, never a fan of bland, over-priced Italian food. The food was as expected. We had to wait for oil and vinegar, wait for cutlery, wait for napkins, wait for bread plates. Then the checks came and we, the couple, were given another members check and were embarrassed to say, \"this is with the other patrons.\" And then, my sister in-law reminded the server, again, that it was my brother in laws birthday. We were the only people on the second floor and they announce to all eight of us it was his birthday. They clapped and sang and no type of dessert was offered. We waited another 20 minutes for the dessert and they said, \"oh, we don't do much for birthdays. If you sign up for our club you will get a brownie next year.\" There was no, \"Have a good night, thanks for coming,\" nothing. Not getting the checks right,nor not getting anything right, especially when you spay $22 dollars for a bowl of pasta, is unacceptable. It was nice to spend time with family but I hope to God I never have to go to this place again and I would never recommend it. Olive Garden, overall, is way better."}
{"text":"When they say family style, the mean FAMILY STYLE. Not only were the food portions huge but each dish was delicious. I'm definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced at a Buca Di Beppo. First night visiting in Scottsdale, coming from California. 

When we sat down, we were asked if we were celebrating anything tonight. We said yes because we are here for my birthday. 

The waiter took our order after waiting 10 minutes. We waited for another 20 minutes to get our salad. Another 15 to have our bread brought out and another 30 to have half of our food brought out (warm, not hot), because Colin our waiter informed us that it takes 25 minutes to have their bolognese dish prepared since it is made from scratch. I take it he didn't even bother putting our order in after he took it. 

Mind you, we had already ordered ONE HOUR and FIVE minutes previously. What a disappointment. I will never recommend this place for anyone to come to, nor will I ever choose to come back. 

Terrible service."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and the food was tasteless dry and over priced.  Serving sizes were under exaggerated promoting us to order more food than needed.  The prices were supposed to be \"cheaper per person\" ordering family style at this place but it cost us  $200.00 for 5 people for what was less tasty than a Stouffers frozen dinner and 10 times the cost.  I would in no way recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Tonight, we had dinner at Buca di Beppo.  I don't think I've ever had better Italian food.  The tastes were simply amazing!  The service was very good too.

We called ahead to ensure we could get seated, but it turns out that the place was rather empty.  The interior of this restaurant is like no other.  The decorations are so complicated and they cover every inch of the place.  We were given a tour of the restaurant and the staff all greeted us, as did some of the guests.

We ordered Breschetta as an appetizer and it was stellar.  Definitely the best we've had.  It had fresh veggies and amazing flavor.  We ordered Chicken Carbonara and Shrimp Florentine for entrees.  The Chicken Carbonara was very rich - too rich for my taste.  But it was still of very good quality and the bacon was tasty.  The Shrimp Florentine was outta this world with fresh spinach, pasta, and shrimp.  I still have the garlic flavor of it in my mouth as I'm writing this review.  So good!

If I'm in the mood for Italian, this is where I'm going."}
{"text":"Where I was raised \"red Italian\" was the default restaurant type, so it takes a lot to impress me.  Consider me \"impressed\" with BdB, I love this place; I would have never taken it to be part of a chain.  The atmosphere is what I would picture Tuscany to be, and there are winding walkways and secluded groves-- very nice.  The waitstaff is friendly and helpful, and the menu is extensive.  Food is very good, which is fortunate because the portions are enormous.  I've enjoyed ravioli, lasagna and, in particular, their chicken Marsala (among the best I've ever had).  A fun place with very good food."}
{"text":"Admit I didn't have a full blown meal.  Just a glass of wine and an antipasto salad. Side order of cheesy garlic bread. 
The salad was nothing to brag about. I would expect a great house dressing but it was almost tasteless and the greens itself were not fresh or cold. Blah. Hard to compare to the day before visit to Gilbert's Brio. Now that's a great place to eat with a house salad to die for!"}
{"text":"All I want to say is that I updated my review because the GM contacted me and made up for my last visit! That's what I call awesome customer service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant my girlfriend and I frequently go to . I'm not rating the restaurant a 1 star, just our past experience . I am writing this in the parking lot of the restaurant mind you. My girlfriend and I pretty much regular customers and we always order the colossal brownie sundae when we come . It is one of our favorite things to do because we can never finish the whole thing . However, this time it tasted horrible, absolutely disgusting . The brownies seemed watered and down and were so hard we couldn't cut them with the spoon, and there had to be only two scoops of vanilla and chocolate in our dessert that usually comes with 5 or 6 scoops. I don't know if there was a different chef on duty or manager but we have never had this kind of experience before and we are extremely disappointed.Also when we told the waiter (Aaron) he seemed as if he didn't care and basically looked as if there was nothing to be done . All I'm saying is , maybe make sure to come during the nighttime when the crew is better ."}
{"text":"A real Italian restaurant located at the Excalibur. Super friendly staff and super cheap beer. Only $ 2 Bud Light on tap. We were at this restaurant almost every day. The lasagna was really amazing."}
{"text":"Order the Linguini Frutti di Mare sm for 16, used a spend over 20 get 10 off coupon.

- Free bread. too soft. comes with olive oil and basalmic vinegar. 
- Free sample of ciao wine! fruity.
- Fruitti di mare comes with shrimp, baby clams, mussels and calamari tossed with spicy red clam sauce and imported Italian linguine. 
- sauce was too watery. 
- lots of clams
- Service a ditzy. Water please? To-go box please?"}
{"text":"Always a good time here. The staff is friendly and very welcoming. Never more than a 2 min wait to get a table if there's even a wait.  

Food is always on point and even better the portions are all family sized!  So be careful when ordering for 2, unless like me and my girl we tend to order for 4 anyway. 


Tip: leave room to try the tira mi su it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for over 20 min without being greeted.. had to get the bartenders attention to get service & then waited another 10 min for her to come & take our oder"}
{"text":"The only time I would come here is if we're doing a working lunch and I don't have to pay for my food. Free doesn't always make the food or the experience better. I always have to come home early/ right after the meal because I'd get a stomach ache.

The portions are huge and meant to be shared but they now have individual lunch portions. I came here with a group as always so we got the large portions of the stuffed mushrooms, calamari, shrimp fra diavolo, eggplant Parmesan, prosciutto stuffed chicken, spaghetti and meatballs and an everything pizza. For dessert we had a tiramisu and strawberry cake.

I'm not going to individually rate each food and go into detail as nothing really stands out. Nothing special. The food is inconsistent. We came here a few months ago and pretty much got the same items on the menu - sometimes the food is dry, sometimes drowning in sauce. The tiramisu could sometimes taste like nothing but alcohol and we're drunk on our working lunch - not good.

I prefer not to write reviews for chain restaurants but I feel strongly about this one because it's very inconsistent and I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE \"FOOD\"! Ordered the veal....asked and found out it is frozen and reheated. Also ordered combo...cannelloni, ravioli, manicotti and stuffed shells...ALSO FROZEN! Everything is shipped in frozen. High prices for frozen food? Do not eat here...go to the supermarket and buy better frozen cheaper. We were served after waiting an hour after ordering. Took one bite and knew instantly it was FROZEN. Immediately left after short conversation with the manager who was surprisingly nice."}
{"text":"This has been a MUCH better experience than an earlier attempt! We had a not so great time here recently & I contacted the manager, Melissa, and explained what had happened... She invited us back & we took her up on the invitation... I'm so very happy that we did! The service was impeccable (ask for Fallon, she's a fantabulous server) & food is back on top! I've always loved Buca in several different states & this one had become a favorite, but looking at recent reviews & our recent experience, I was worried, but not anymore! They do seem to listen to their customers! Please continue striving for excellence!!!"}
{"text":"...called at 6p to see if they would take reservations for that night. yes, but not 7p... 7:15p is open. Cool, table for 4 at 7:15 it is. We arrived at 7:10 and were told we will call your name when a table is ready... at 7:25 I asked if our 7:15 reservation was ready yet and she said we are a little behind. There are a few still ahead of you... Our name was called at 7:46 after 4 tables of 4 and a table of 6 were seated. 
Anyone can take a reservation... Its the holding of the reservation that counts right? (UNHAPPY)
 The food was OK, a small salad for the table, 2 shared dinners for 4, a side of pasta with a meatball & 1, $12 bottle of wine and 2 deserts nothing worth going out of your way for at a cost of almost $150.00. There was also 5 or 6 \"birthday/clapping\" sessions around us like at Applebees.
The wait staff was nice, quick and good looking, but I'd rather have a slow, ugly waiter with good food myself.
No hurry to go back there... ever."}
{"text":"We picked up our to go order last night for the first time and became so intrigued by the setting and layout of the restaurant. We asked to walk around to check the place out, the staff was so welcoming and extremely nice... traveling through the kitchen was a cool experience in itself, the only reason we were disappointed was because we did not dine-in along the positive atmosphere. We came home, watched game of thrones, and enjoyed the food immensely, next time we will stay to eat and have the full Italian experience."}
{"text":"I ate here with several colleagues while in town for a work trip. I agree with many other reviewers....do not eat here alone! It is a family style place and the portion sizes are made to serve several people!

We ordered the Brussels sprouts with prosciutto. They were delicious! Perfectly roasted with a generous amount of crispy prosciutto. We also ordered a chicken dish and spaghetti and meatballs. I wasn't a fan of the meatballs and the red sauce in that dish, just not my taste. 

Service was good. It was difficult for them to find appropriate seating for our group of 7 and it took them two attempts of seating us and realizing the table wasn't big enough to finally find a table. But the end of the table was up against a wall, so the server couldn't reach the furthest 4 people at the table to serve them drinks or take their plates away, so that was awkward. It was also really loud in the restaurant. Lots of screaming children and the kitchen was really close to our table, so it made it difficult to converse with everyone at the table. 

Overall, it was a good experience. Would I be eager to go back the next time I'm in town....probably not."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. We usually get our food to go. I would  give the food and the service, 5 stars. Thanks to Cindy! She's awesome.
However, I am giving 3 stars for their parking situation. Since I always get my food to go, I expect to have a space on the to go parking spot. But I  can't find any spot, esp on weekends. There are assholes who use the curbside parking even when they dine in. I have talked to the manager about this. I don't know if they are actually going to fix this problem. If not, I would definitely consider coming here less frequently."}
{"text":"I think it's a great concept but slightly overrated. The carbonara tasted like fish but the salad with apples and cranberries was yummy, my daughters mac and cheese was so good."}
{"text":"The hostess didn't ask us where we wanted to sit and forgot to set our table. Our waitress was very good but seemed to be too busy. They need better management to train their people to work as a team. The host staff should have been helping in other areas. Other than that the food was good but it would have been nice to get some warm complimentary bread. I had to ask multiple times for the bread and when we did finally get some it was cold and slightly stale."}
{"text":"I personally love family style dining. Sharing food at the table is a rarity for many families these days, and eating here with my family recreated that, even if just a little bit. Always helps when the food is good!

We ordered a large portion of baked pasta, a small mixed green salad portion, and a large portion of mozzarella bread. Everything was very good and plenty for our family of 5. Our server was friendly and helpful, having to explain a few things since it was our first time eating there.

My only complaint is the somewhat cramped dinning area that is cluttered with decoration."}
{"text":"Very nice place with big portions. The menu and server let you know. Family/group style eatery. Dim lit, which I love. If you haven't been there... It's definitely worth a go. And come hungry!"}
{"text":"We have come here several times in past years and had enjoyable dining experiences.  It's been a few months since the last visit,  though,  and there sure have been changes.   New menus,  new prices (which are significantly higher), and some old favorites are no longer available - in particular the 1893 Salad.  The veal parmesan was tough, chewy,  almost rubbery - and expensive.  Standard salad and cheese bread were fine.  

Dinner for two of us, with small salad, small entree, small pasta, bread, no drinks, was nearly $80, before tip.

And, the restaurant is showing quite a bit of wear and tear.  The ceiling in the room where we were seated had a gaping hole in it.  Benches were lumpy.

Overall a big disappointment.  We aren't very excited about coming back."}
{"text":"Unique and cool Ambiance. A bit corky, but great seating that gives you room. I recommend that you sit in the kitchen at least once. There pastas are okay, calamari is good. Their stuffed shells are very good. Service is slow, but it is meant to be a place where you can sit, talk and relax. It is suppose to be a bit slow. 
Overall, good. Above average food, great ambiance and descent service."}
{"text":"Food is delish. Ordered seafood trio platter,  spaghetti..pasta more..and for the finale... Chocolate chip cannoli!!! Good place to experience italian food. Food came a lil slow but so far everything is great."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed with this meal. We ordered online for delivery. $50 for large chicken parrm and florentine bread. What was supposed to be 30 minutes became close to an hour, on an average Sunday evening. We ordered the large so that we'd have leftovers for lunch the next day, since it's just me, my husband and my 3 year old. Sadly, there was no pasta included. Since when does chicken parm come without pasta? I had no idea. There is no explanation for why this meal is so expensive. The bread was like $13 and came with 4 slices of bread with a few leaves of spinach and a tiny bit of diced tomato mixed into the cheese. After waiting an hour and paying $50, it is ridiculous that my husband had to cook pasta to go with dinner. Very disappointed; will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Horrible service...waited 10 minutes for acknowledgement that they knew we were here.  Then another 5 for water to arrive."}
{"text":"As a local resident I always crave the Rosa sauce from Buca di Beppo but I can not convince myself to go to the strip. I saw this location on google and decided to come here with friends. They have their own private parking lot so free parking. One perk outside the strip. There is hardly a line. Second perk of being outside the strip. Due to being less busy, our waitress was more attentive and a lot of friendliness was felt.

As a party of four we got two lunch portions of spaghetti and a salad (one of each) and the small family portion of the spicy chicken pasta. We also ordered a small order of garlic bread and we were stuffed! The meal comes with regular bread but it's cold so I recommend the garlic bread. Small portion is about 8-9 sliced pieces. The large is about 5-6 more slices.

Man I wish they sold their Rosa sauce! The main reason why I come here is because of that sauce. Pretty sure that's the main reason of its popularity!"}
{"text":"I've been here probably three times over the course of several years. Each time I've gotten something different and it's been hit or miss in terms of how I've liked it. The last time was a week or so ago. Ordered a chicken dish which I don't see on the online menu. It was three stuffed chicken breasts and was a bit over $20 with no sides. Then we ordered pasta with marinara for an additional $9 or so and garlic bread for another $8ish. For the amount of food you get, the prices are a bit high. The chicken was really good, the pasta and garlic bread were very so-so. Not much different than I would expect at an Olive Garden or the like. Service was excellent and our waitress was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We used to go here often , loved this place I wish they start to serve a gluten free menu so I could come back. Very nice place . Food is delicious ."}
{"text":"Delicious! We were looking for another restaurant and we couldn't find it... Then this nice guy (older man) approached us and invited us to walk in to his restaurant. We absolutely liked everything we ordered. The waitress gave us salad for free with the menu. My husband ordered lamb; he said it was very taste. I ordered the classic fettuccini alfredo. I gave my pasta 9.5 out of 10."}
{"text":"My first time and it was very tasty! The Eggplant Parm was amazing. The tomatoes on top were a great addition full of flavor. The Bread was good. The antipasto salad was super fresh and cold. Large family style servings made it a wonderful family experience. I will always recommend Buca after every family funeral."}
{"text":"Food, drinks, staff... all were amazing! Norrese and Matt were extremely helpful. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First off... Went on Christmas Day and Most of the food was fantastic.   Incredible flavors and cooked to perfection.   Reserved via OpenTable and check in was quick and we were seated about 5 minutes before our time even though the place was packed.   We ordered a family Salad and as we were all about to eat it my 9 year old noticed something on her fork full of lettuce.... A bug.   I examined it closely and sure enough it was one.   So I told a passing waiter who apologized and asked if we wanted another salad.   We declined... Since we figured all the salad had come from the same source.   The manager eventually came over and assured us that we'd be \"taken care of.\"  He said... The \"salad is on the house.\"  My wife said... \"That's good because we didn't eat it,\" and we waited for an offer to maybe comp something else.   The owner explained... It probably came from the supplier that way and he hopes we understand.   I won't say that the bug in our salad totally ruined our meal... But I thought the manager could have done more to make sure we returned as customers.   As of right now... I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I don't see what people see about this place, except its good for large parties.

The food was not very good, no flavor at all, mostly tasted garlic. Don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the meal we had but I'm disappointed that the garlic bread wasn't included with the meal and that we had to pay for bread. Otherwise the family style atmosphere was appealing. And everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"Service sucked . The meat balls were great but the Alfredo wad made for old people with restrictions of food.. like no salt or no flovor"}
{"text":"Before you go, I think you should know there are a LOT of LARGE provocative pictures of women that I, and many others probably, deem very inappropriate for young family members (as pictured by others and commented on by others here on Yelp)!! I do not consider this a family friendly restaurant. Perhaps they should reconsider their choices of \"art\" if they want to be a family friendly restaurant or rename the place Buca di Boobs so people understand what type of atmosphere they are walking into!

UPDATE since the Manager's response:

The most offensive piece of \"art\" is where a woman has a spaghetti noodle in her cleavage and the man's eyes are zeroed in on her cleavage and it appears he is about to eat it up!! In my opinion, this is definitely NOT family friendly \"art\"!! I am NOT a snowflake or even a supporter of the #METOO movement. I am, however, teaching my young son to have respect for women!!"}
{"text":"It gonna lie...we went here during inclement weather, and were one of the Only tables occupied in the restaurant. My bill was $75.00 (tip included) for a small baked rigatoni, a meatball, a coffee with Amaretto and 2 soft drinks. The pasta was still hard and wasn't that hot. My coffee got cold because I needed creamers....and the food portion was nothing to write home about. Never coming back here. Not a good value."}
{"text":"If I could leave a half star, I would! Service was TERRIBLE!! We came here for my husband's birthday dinner. We were seated out on the terrace and literally FORGOTTEN! The manager came out and apologized and said she would send someone right out ... no one came out!! We sat and waited and waited!! No service!! HORRIBLE!! We eventually got up and left! Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"The Hostess was more concerned with the computer screen. Our server was kind and attentive in the beginning. After she delivered the prosciutto chicken that she recommended (we originally came for chicken Parmesan)  she was nowhere to be found. Our chicken wasn't cooked. She took the undercooked chicken away after 10 minutes or so and offered the chicken Parmesan. We asked for it to go & waited for it to come out. It didn't come out to go. When she delivered it to the table we had no silverware or plates because she had taken them away. We asked for to-go containers and she seemed surprised. Would not recommend and will never return!"}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner. Dinners are family style and leave your appetite satisfied. Small spaghetti order has 2fist sized meatballs and can feed 3 people easily . Friendly service. But divey on purpose. Supposed to look like Joe's basement in 1960's era NY or NJ . Food better than average,but not Maggianos."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Buca is one of my favorite Italian places to eat. Unfortunately, my husband and I walked in to have some lunch and a drink on our day off together...  we waited 10 minutes and never got greeted or saw anyone. 

If I want Buca in the future, I will be going to the one on Ray and I10. They appreciate the customers they get, as should every restaurant."}
{"text":"Great family style Italian. A great place for friends to get together."}
{"text":"We went to Bucca Di Beppo on Sunday night and the service was horrible.  We ordered an appetizer of Garlic Cheese bread and 2 small pasta dishes (we love leftovers) and a small Chicken Parmesan.  We had waited for quite some time for the appetizer.  When I asked our waitress about it she said as soon as it was done she would get it to us.  Right after she left the table our dinner came delivered by another worker.  Our waitress came over again and said she would check on the bread....I told her to forget it...it was an appetizer and now we have our dinner. It was obvious she forgot to add it to the order and instead of owning the mistake seemed put off by me.  She was less than interested in serving us.  We usually like Bucca but the prices are high for service that sucks and food that is becoming average."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday with a party of 10.  All of us were disappointed.  Three of us shared a ravioli dish, it was cold.  Other dishes were scalding hot.  We were never offered grated cheese.  When we were finished eating the waitress showed up to ask how everything WAS...when we told her about the cold food and cheese she couldn't have cared less.  They do add 18 percent tip which she mentioned as she dropped the check on the table."}
{"text":"Had a great time  here. Fun place to eat. So much on the walls to look at. Good environment. Staff is friendly and helpful. Lg portions so be prepared. Every time we come here we are extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"Kinda ditzy waitresses but, this is my favorite place to eat in the WHOLE world! I am pretty mad that I wanted to have a group of 15 for our anniversary this year but,  the marketer I was emailing back and forth with (anthony) said I have to PRE PICK what everyone is going to eat or have buffet syle. My family and friends would like to pick their own food out. He said it's because, of the holidays... Well you just lost a BUNCH of business! He was rude as well."}
{"text":"Happy Hour ALL DAY long... WTF? done.

we were staying next door and our friends were staying in Excalibur. happened to peruse the menu for food and noticed the $2, $3 and $5 Happy Hour. awesome. look, it may be BdB and commercial \"italian\", but, who cares. HAPPY HOUR!!! $2 domestic beer, $3 imports and $5 wells and wines. Bam. done. DONE!

it's difficult to get cheap drinks inside a Hotel/Casino located ON the Strip, unless of course you're gambling. so when i come across a spot that has one, i'm all about it. the HH is bar only, but, there is plenty of room in there at the bar, as well as the seats around. no HH food, and what was available was kinda expensive, which is my knock. the mozzerella \"sticks\" that we ordered were premade and frozen, prior to being fried. oh well. at least i got $2 Blue Moons."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a million years! I don't think I had been to any of the locations since 2005. But they were very generous and gave all of the local teachers in the area a coupon for a free dessert. I could not miss that! Enjoyed the manicotti with a plate of Meatballs. Very excellent except the sauce with the meatballs was very lackluster. It did not feel like restaurant quality. The manicotti was to die for though! The cheese was amazing, the pasta shell had the perfect firmness, and the sauce on top just finished it off so well. 

We had the Colossal Brownie dessert at the end and that was something I never seen before. It was very delicious but very, very, very big! The two of us could not finish it and we have very hearty appetites. Overall it was great and Ashley was one of the best servers! They only lost one star because of the lackluster sauce with the meatballs. Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Buca's all over the country and generally love their food, so I stopped by here tonight and ordered a carry out salad (di Bepo 1893) to take back to my hotel.  They packed it with a nice, warm loaf of bread which was great.  But when I opened the salad, I noticed that the salami and pepperoni were no where to be found.  I called the restaurant about 5-10 mins after closing.  The manager actually answered the phone, apologized profusely for the error, and then sent a new, correctly made salad over to my hotel!  Plus more bread! (He made the guy who screwed it up do the delivery.) Maybe I shouldn't give them five stars for a screwed up order, but hey, everybody makes mistakes, and they really went above and beyond to make it right."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant a few times and never had a complaint. Staff is always great. Atmosphere is noisy and fun, just like your Grandma's kitchen. I'm not Italian so I don't know if this passes for real Italian food, but I know it's good food. 
We had a large group so we were able to try out quite a few selections. I was drinking their Buca Bella specialty drink, quite refreshing. We started with the Apple Gorgonzola Salad, the taste surprised me, perfect for the holidays with the cranberries, fresh apples, and spiced walnuts. We also tried the fresh Mozzarella Caprese. I'm forever a fan of their Cheesy Bread Florentine but we got the Pizza con Formaggio instead this time. And to round out our first round of food, some tender Fried Calamari with spicy marinara dipping sauce. Yum!
For our main courses we noshed on Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Marsala, Lasagna, Chianti Braised Short Ribs, Shrimp Fra Diavlo, Spicy Chicken Rigatoni, and Baked Rigatoni. Sides included Green Beans, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Italian Brocolli Romano. Yes, I was so full after sampling everything! All of the food was really good but the chicken and spicy pasta selections stood out to me. The chicken was very tender and moist, delicious.
Ready and willing to go back soon."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL staff are great and very welcoming my server John is great.  Portions are huge and the bread WOW.  FREE for my birthday for just joining the club buccalove.com.  When in Vegas have to  visit this location."}
{"text":"What a disappointing meal the night before the Pittsburgh Marathon.  A group of us showed up at 3:30pm and asked for a table for 6.  We were rudely informed that because we had no reservations, we could only sit outside.  It was really nice out, so we were fine with that.  They told us that they were completely booked until 8:30pm.  Ok fine whatever, sit us outside.  Next time, just ask if we want to sit outside instead of being mean about it.

So, we sit down and my fiance' decides to check for reservations on his phone.  WE COULD HAVE MADE RESERVATIONS FOR ANY TIME SLOT THAT EVENING.  We were tempted to make a reservation for 3:45pm and walk right back to the hostess stand to prove them wrong.  We can not believe they did this.  They lied, they were NOT full or they wouldn't have had reservations online.

The food was just okay.  Nothing special.  We split a few appetizers for the table and then my fiance' and I tried the spicy chicken rigatoni pasta.  It was barely spicy and the chicken was dry and I couldn't eat it.  Overall, we were disappointed and the rude service was just the icing on the cake.  Don't think we would be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for Italian food. Service was slow and by the Tim our food came is was warm not steaming hot.  If you go make sure you have reservations and have time not to spare."}
{"text":"Only went here because of their other location in Hollywood... Vegas over priced their meals and the food wasn't that great. The portions were huge, but the quality of food wasn't there. If you've been to Bucas elsewhere, don't come here. It won't meet your expectations. Won't come back."}
{"text":"First off the Excalibur now charges for parking what a rip. The prices at this Buca are insane.

Ever eat a $35 chicken breast or a $10 side of mashed potatoes? I just did. And it tasted like the best microwaved garbge anyone can serve up. Chicken was as dry as a rock. Food took forever to come out.

For 2 people the bill came to $100. The food was no better than Dennys or Applebees.

Service was ok.

Tables very close together very loud and annoying."}
{"text":"12/26/11 7:45pm.
I go to the hostess station and request seating for one.  Hostess asks if i wish to be seated at the bar, and I politely declined.  She then said \"we are not taking any more walk in business tonight.\"  

I have a suggestion on where this place can shove a few of their meatballs."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this location yesterday and had the spicy chicken rigatoni. This was the lunch special for $12.99 and it was still enough to feed two people. It included large penne pasta with a spicy sauce, fresh tomatoes and peas. The sauce was very creamy and had the perfect amount of spice. I felt like there was a good amount of fresh, moist chicken spread throughout the dish.

Every interaction with the staff was pleasant. Both the host and the manager very helpful and kind. When I put in the order, they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. I went to the restaurant, the manager automatically knew my order and the host went to get it right away. I was in and out within about 5 minutes. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had Party / Going away Event group of 20... Now the Fried Mozzarella is Fabulous, ok,, enough said about that.. 

The paste and sauce here always seems watered down to me where the sauce doesn't cling to the pasta.. ehh,,, The Mussels dish tho, that broth was pretty great.. . , Not sure about being a Regular, for the price... Not the best bang for the buck,, maybe a couple beers n fried mozzarella next time only.. 

Couple people in the group wanted to use coupons and pretty much had to argue with the manager to accept,, wanted to give 3.5 stars,,, but hey MOZZARELLA = bomb..."}
{"text":"The place has a great atmosphere but neither food nor service was up to the mark. It gets 3 just for the place and the place is really good for groups. Dinner portions are only for 3 or 6 people. There is no single serving size for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great food great place 5/5 I recommend many people to come and eat this delicious Italian cuisine"}
{"text":"We ate here as part of a dinner party after a wedding. We sat in the Pope Room, which was perfect for this situation. It had a giant lazy Susan on the table so you didn't have to pass around hot dishes to get food. Our waiter was attentive and nice and prompt. Very similar to other Buca restaurants I have eaten at, which is a good thing! Makes it predictable! It was a great place for families and large groups of people/parties."}
{"text":"Family style dining for a great price. They have a 20% off July coupon. 

Loved the experience. Kids had fun celebrating a birthday. Huge portions with great desserts. 

Will return soon!"}
{"text":"When do you every go to Bucca and walk away disappointed?  Never right, this is no exception.  We love coming here of course our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs, and we order way too much, but then take home is a good way to get to eat more goodness the next day!

We love the sauage and mushroom pizza and they have taken it off the menu, but we always ask for it and they always make it for us anyway, that's one way to keep us happy!  The service is another, always excellent, very quick with the refills, we are never waiting for attention.

After several visits, and ordering too many dishes, we have learned that we are good with one pasta and one pizza, taking home a lot of it, because we always save room for desert  This place is great for special occasions, with you and your best friend, or a group of friends, the atmosphere is loaded with good food, good fun and if you with someone special good company!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this experience.  This is my 2nd experience at this location, first time was last year at my cousin's graduation - food tasted fresh, hot and the service was impeccable.  This trip?? Horrible.  Our cousins were visiting from New York and a few of us from San Diego drove over to meet them; there was a total of 14 in our party.  The waiter (Kevin I think) seemed friendly when a few of us first arrived but then quickly got overwhelmed.

We ordered the di Beppo salad, Cesar salad, green beans, baked ziti, eggplant parmesan, veal marsala, chicken marsala and calamari.  The salads were great, good flavor, cold and crisp.  Calamari was excellent, comes in a huge martini glass (tentacles and everything)!! The breading is light, not greasy and you can actually taste the calamari which is extremely tender.  The baked ziti was extremely dry, very little sauce.  Both marsala dishes came covered in a thick sauce which seemed more like a glaze rather than an actual marsala sauce; the meats were tender though.  All of the food (minus the salads) came out luke warm.

The green beans were the biggest disappointment; one of my aunts is a vegetarian, and this is one of her favorites.  We placed two orders to start, but both lacked flavor and seemed like the beans were previously frozen.  She sent one of the plates back and was brought a \"fresh, hot batch.\"  However this one was worse than the first two - no flavor, chewy and tasted like they had been quickly defrosted. 

This is usually such a fun restaurant to come too and have family style meals; I've been to multiple locations but this one is the worst one by far.  I know restaurants have off nights but this was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"What Italian restaurant does not serve garlic bread with your meal? This one!  You have to place a special order for it. Their chanti was flat, calamari was bland. My husband ordered the veal parm said that if he was wearing a blindfold while eating dinner he wouldn't be able to tell what he was eating! Breakout the pepper mill! Sausage stuffed shells were tasty however the texture was like mush. The drinks are overpriced and the waiter never picked up our appetizer plate from our table. If you go there dress warmly. Way too cold. If your into bland food this place is for you. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"I've always been a Buca Di Beppo fan and our visit in Las Vegas hasn't changed my mind in the least.  

We ate here for dinner AFTER ( they're open to midnight)  the Tournament of Kings.  They never fail to impress. We might have been the only ones there that it's more expensive at home than Vegas.  We managed to feed an entire family for about $100, yes 9 of us ( do 3 yr olds count?).

It's located on the third level of the Excalibur hotel which made it really convenient.  The service was fantastic !  Unlike most Bucas, this restaurant featured an open concept making it much brighter than usual.
LOVE the bread"}
{"text":"UNACCEPTABLE!!! Ordered the valentine special 2 days prior. Never got notification that there was a computer mix up and the order never came through.... they told me the card declined... how could it decline when I made a contract to pay in store... well on my end they got it, I got an email stating my order came through and I got a legit order confirmation number. When I get there they are like we have no order for you. What did I do... I shoved that email in their face. They went to the back, came back with an email from the manager stating my card declined, I'm like how did my card decline when I never ever gave you made card, EVER. And to make things so much more awesome... to add salt in the wound... I get a ding and email right in front of the manager with the email supposedly suppose to sent to me an hour ago notifying me my order/ card got declined and to call the fricken store. Well would have done that if I had fricken known an hour ago!! Well just FYI MY FIANCÉ is now at home, after a 12 hour shift from the hospital... sitting in the dark and no food cuz I couldn't set up a damn thing. Now they said they'll put a rush order in for me, we shall see. Thanks for ruining my first Valentine's Day for my fiancé."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm the pizza was delicious excellent customer service everyone was super nice valentines was great there definitely a must try it out"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience for my wedding party. The food was delicious and the customer service exceeded expectations! Will definitely consider Buca for all my future celebrations."}
{"text":"Walking into Excalibur should've been a forewarning to the level of service we would receive.  Knowing Buca is generally a family-style eatery, the hostess sat us a the bar table without asking if we were ordering a meal or only beverages.  The server was overwhelmed with tables which was odd since the restaurant didn't have that many patrons. We asked to be moved to a booth which took some time. Eventually we were accomodated and promptly asked \"what is wrong\". I explained we needed more room for the 3 of us. We received our food quickly afterward which the quality and portions were fair.  I would've rated an average had it not been for the passively twatty hostess's crappy attitude."}
{"text":"I got married March 17 and had dinner after the ceremony for all our guest. Which was 70+ people. We brought our own cake, they set up a cake table for us free of charge. They set up our wedding favors, so we didn't have to come early to do it ourselves. Everything was perfect and we had a great time. Cynthia Diaz is the sales coordinator, she made everything so easy and smooth. She's the best. We couldn't ask for more, she made our stressful day easy, well on the reception part. I recommend to anyone to book a party with them, they'll make your day special and easy."}
{"text":"After leaving grape street cafe due to terrible service we decided to go to Buca.
As we sat down at the bar we were greeted by the bartender, very friendly and the service was great. You get huge portions of classic Italian and the house Cianti is really good. We had a great time. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went to Buca because it was close to home and did not feel like driving down to Carmine's in Caesar Palace. The portion of chicken Parm and calamari I had were fine but the taste was nothing to rave about. Service was Ok and the interior of the place is very old work from Italy. Buca is good in a pinch if I don't feel like driving but I won't be craving it any time soon. Not the worse place by far. It was convenient and served its purpose."}
{"text":"We made reservations at this location for our party of 15 on a Sunday night hoping that it wouldn't be as crazy as either of the Strip locations. We made the correct decision. Buca's food and service has always been consistent for us. 

We had a 7 PM reservation and were seated immediately. They originally had us at two separate tables, but with 6 kids under the age of 12, we were able to squeeze comfortably into one large table. This made things more intimate, and I picked a middle spot at the table and was still able to converse with everyone around the table, including my 3 year old nephew.

One server tackled our entire party, and she did a great job. There was somewhat of an extended wait for the entrees to come out, but none of us minded because it gave everyone a chance to catch up and we had some appetizers and salad already.

Food: Fried mozzarella, fried calamari, apple gorgonzola salad, chicken parmigiana, lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs, and the colossal brownie sundae. I like the lasagna, the portion is huge, but we had enough people to finish it off.  My wife and I enjoy the apple gorgonzola salad especially. It has a little bit of everything but is balanced: sweet, tart, crunchy, bitter, and salty. I would definitely recommend the salad.

Because we get the same, enjoyable food and service every time, and because it's a great place for our whole family to get together, we have yet to find any reason to stop coming here."}
{"text":"Went to this place at 9:40 they close at 10:00pm me and the family went to the table and we Heard all the waitresses screaming loud! Saying we want to go home and now we can't! We can also hear the cooks screaming loud too ..we felt so LOW so we left without ordering as soon as we left we Heard clapping and cheering..they are so rude! Will never go here Again!"}
{"text":"Average. Food took a really long time... Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Great looking place with big prices, big portions and mediocre food. The meat dishes (that are in the range of $21 - $40 a plate) don't come with a side. If you want a side, then that's an extra $7-$9. Even something such as the Italian broccoli is $9. Here's a tip for anyone who goes here, the small portions are huge and the large portions are even huger. Order the small portions and share your food with others. Order a meat dish and then order a pasta dish, ask for extra plates and just create your own meat with a side of pasta dish.

For appetizers, we ordered the calamari ($13). They were so tiny. Tiny little itty bitty rings and teeny tiny little clusters of tentacles. I've had bigger and better calamari, and for far less. Then for our entrees, we ordered the Linguini Frutti Di Mare (a seafood linguini in wine sauce) and the Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken. My husband and I shared them amongst each other. The seafood on the Linguini was good and abundant, however the pasta was terrible. For $23 a plate, I expected the Linguini to be fresh (there is a huge and obvious difference) It wasn't, it was obviously a dried pasta that was overcooked, whereas it had a slimy consistency. I've had fresh pastas at Italian restaurants in Chicago, Philly, and New York that weren't even close to these outrageous prices. One that comes to mind is La Luce in Chicago (one of my favorites). They serve fresh homemade pasta, and the prices range from $14-$17 for huge portions. 

As for the chicken, it was ok. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was wonderfully juicy. However, the breading on top was a little burnt, creating a bitter flavor. That was really disappointing. Again, for $23 I expected more. 

The service was great though. That is until we paid for our dinner. After that our waiter could have cared less. He shoved a large portion of linguini into a tiny plastic container, then wrapped it in a plastic bag with my husbands leftovers. When I went to grab the bag, the bag broke, fell on the ground and my linguini spilled everywhere within the bag. Our waiter just walked by a few times without saying a word. He didn't even offer to help get us a second container and bag. We finally stopped him to ask for them. He fetched one for us, and still completely dismissed what had happened. The sad part is, it was only us and another small party, so being too busy to help wasn't really an issue. He just flat out didn't care. It was so obvious and really awkward. 

All in all, the experience was not that great. My wallet is very sad and so is my palate. Bucca should either serve better food or lower their prices."}
{"text":"My husband and myself had heard about this place for a few months before finally deciding to go on our anniversary.. We made reservations thinking that it would be packed on a Sunday afternoon..

We visited on 11/9/14 and I wanted to wait and cool down before writing my review on this restaurant..

Upon arrival, we quickly realized we would not need the reservations. Whereas everywhere else was packed with waiting, Buca di Beppo had 5 cars in the parking lot.Once inside we were quickly seated (after the hostesses fought about where to put us)...

First thing, drinks.. Yes, they do have sweet tea but no, there is no way they make it fresh (unless they are just that skilled to make it taste like pre-made). It was horrible. They also carry Pepsi products, which is a preference to them but not us...

Secondly, I do meat sauce on my spaghetti (Hubby wanted to do the meatballs). I asked to order it that way, $3 charge, okay but give me meat sauce, not clumps of meat chopped up and no sauce. The meatballs were huge clumps of meatloaf (Hubby even said, \"If I knew it was meatloaf, I would have ordered it to be on the side and asked for ketcup.\" Also, the spaghetti is definitely served \"italian style\" not overcooked (I liked it but Hubby likes it cooked to death).

Third, the chicken parm is really good and it was the item we enjoyed most. The sauce was even good but, note to our server, it is NOT something you reheat because it does dry out. 

Fourth, we got a coupon for a free desert on our anniversary. We ordered the cannolis and they were not good. The creme was very bitter and I could not stand them. Really wished we ordered the sundae but we knew we were full and didn't want to waste it...Oh and the singing, ask before coming to the table with candles, we are NOT outspoken people and really stay to ourselves. We hated it!

Finally, when we finally got the check, we went to pay and our server went to hide. We finally went to walk out and finally found him in another dining room. It was the first time that I have ever had to track down a waiter to give them money. I was just thankful we paid cash, so we could walk right out the door.."}
{"text":"Mediocre! Went here with a very large group. The food wasn't bad, but exactly what you would expect at a large scale 'italian' restaurant chain. The food is very, very large portions, of which we all shared. The spicy pasta wasn't very spicy, but ate it anyways. It wasn't bad. I guess I would just say that all the food 'wasn't bad'. It wasn't that good, but it wasn't bad. I definitely would not come here with my husband on a date."}
{"text":"My wife and I hosted a memorial dinner for her mother and sister. We visited the restaurant and met with the manager (Vicky) who was very helpful and kind She took the time to show us all of the different themed rooms, and helped us find just the right one. 

The original room that we chose, the Wine Room, the AC was out on the day of the event, so we set things up in another room and it was fabulous. 

For our appetizer, we had the mozzarella caprese, which was delicious! Tomatoes with fresh basil and olive oil...fabulous. Then we had two salads: a mixed green, and the apple gorgonzola - which was by far the family favorite!

Next we had the chicken parmigiana, and it was fantastic. Nice crisp breading in a marinara sauce topped with mozzarella. We also had fettuccine Alfredo, and spaghetti with meat sauce. Both equally delicious. 

Finally, it was the desserts: double dark chocolate cake, and of course, tiramisu. 

It was a great event with fabulous food.

Thank you Buca di Peppo for making this a great experience."}
{"text":"$200 to go order.  No big deal with price. Get it TO GO. Does anyone say chicken parm orders don't come with pasta? Or plates? When I called and asked for manager, she was horribly unapologetic. As if I knew there were no plates. No \"sides\" (pasta) with chicken parm orders. Where does someone get chicken parm with no pasta without someone saying \"do you want pasta with that?\"
Bucca Di Bye Bye. Calamari fishy and no marinara? Oh is that extra?"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how happy I was with their service. My friend planned a funny 40th birthday party for her fiancee downstairs. It kinda got all jumbled up. I ran upstairs they were able to accommodate us. Manager was super nice, hostesses were too, and our waiter Christian was awesome!

about 40 patron shots later our bill was over $600 mainly from the booze and we were happy to spend it!  

Nicest service at a 'chain restaurant' that I've had.  

We ordered pasta, Chicken, Pizza, fried cheese, salad, everything we had food for days!"}
{"text":"We made a very expensive mistake choosing Buca to provide food for our two Market Update meetings for our clients. Be aware that the portion sizes they advertise are no where near enough to feed the number of people that they represent. We had to DOUBLE the size of the order, beyond what they suggest, for our second session.

The chicken was ok, not great and the baked penne was TERRIBLE. Dry and over cooked. The green beans and broccoli were good but the bread was stale.

VERY DISAPPOINTING! ! !
VERY EXPENSIVE! ! !"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 12 and they were ready for us immediately. We sat down and the server was there right away to take our drink orders and came back quickly and efficiently to take our appetizer and dinner orders. There were a lot of people, with a lot of orders and she managed to do it very quickly. Our food came out correct and very fast! Everything was right on top of that! 

The chicken saltimbocca, the enormous meatballs and the spinach cannelloni were amount the table's favorite dishes. 

We did separate checks at the end and everything was right there too. Overall we were very impressed with the service and with the quality of the food, especially for a chain restaurant! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"For a chain, I'm impressed. We had dinner here right after my son's hockey game. We walked in with no reservations, but they were able to sit us. Part of the experience was getting a \"tour\" of the place before you get to your actual table.

It took 7 minutes before our server got to us. Be diligent! The servings are family style, hence the pricing of each dish. There is an option for 2-4 (Small) or for more diners  (Large). Once we perused the menu, we were ready to order.

Server asked for our drinks, but she became pushy when she insisted that we give our drink orders first even if we have informed her that we were ready to order.  Oh well.

We got the apple gorgonzola salad, calamari, spicy sausage pasta, and cheese pizza for the kids. Calamari came out first-- good marinara dipping sauce. Next came the salad, nothing spectacular or memorable about the salad.

Then came the bread; it was on the spot! For a chain, their bread recipe was yummy. However, we did notice that the kids meals pizza came out too late. Typically, kids meals are served immediately since we are dealing with hungry children. As our shared entree, the spicy sausage was passable, but nothing extraordinary. I liked the marinara sauce better from the calamari appetizer. This is another \"oh well\" moment for us. We never got our drinks refilled too. 

Overall, will we try this place again? Yes, maybe with another server next time. 

Verdict: Food was decent to merit a 2nd visit, but service needs to reflect a more consistent, less pushy approach. For the price of the dishes, we expect more satisfying dining experience."}
{"text":"My family and I went to dinner here for my brothers birthday. He loves this place (for some reason) so we were all expecting a somewhat pleasant dining experience to celebrate his special day. For starters, this place is family style, so the portions and prices are designed to feed 2 or more. My parents both ordered drinks - when our server brought out my dad's beer she sloshed half of it on the table and walked away. I also couldn't help but feel this place is overpriced. We ordered the caprese and artichoke dip to start, both of which were around $15. The caprese was perfect and the artichoke dip was okay - rather small for the price. We ordered 2 chicken entrees and a pasta dish all of which were about $25 a piece. They were all alright but for what you're paying alright doesn't cut it. The service was slow, the room we were in was noisy, the tables around us weren't cleared for a good 30 minutes - it was a Monday night so there wasn't really a reason for any of this. Anyway, we had a nice time but personally I probably wouldn't eat here again. Step up the service and clean up the environment. Hopefully the management reads these reviews and improves in the areas everyone is complaining about. Cheers."}
{"text":"I normally really like this place, but today was the first time I ever got up and left a restaurant. We were seated for 20 minutes and no one even spoke to us to let us know he/she would be right with us. Not one of the servers even made eye contact with us, let alone offered us water. We are now on our way to Bravo."}
{"text":"Had confirmed reservations for Christmas Day.  Unfortunately the restaurant lost the reservation. It took them over 45 minutes to find a seat for us and never apologized for their error.  They are one of the few restaurants that were open so they were very busy during the day. Service was a little slow in comparison to previous visits. Food and service was ok."}
{"text":"Great Italian meal. Lovely atmosphere. It makes you feel like you are in the heart of Little italy somewhere. The service was great. Thought it was slightly odd that you walk through the kitchen to get to your seat, but acutally a great idea. I just was not expecting to see the kitchen. The House Chianti could have been better as well. All in all a great place for some comfort food. The fettucine alfredo is amazing."}
{"text":"It's Olive Garden with a personality. Buca di Beppo, though a chain, has more than a few things going for it. 

The Scottsdale location can easily accommodate large groups. Family style servings contribute to great interaction with friends and family. The décor is gaudy and creative, with an emphasis on Italian heritage and a touch of humor here and there. Gene Simmons on the celebrity wall? Generally friendly staff. Kid friendly (triangular crayons!). And the food is decent.

Any negatives? The entrees, while solid, don't have the impact of a true fine Italian restaurant. On this visit we ordered the Apple Gorgonzola Salad. It was enjoyed by all. The Chicken Cannelloni and the Chicken Marsala were great. The Baked Ziti, however, was dry and far from flavorful. Three out of four isn't bad I suppose. And a single mistake is less catastrophic since everything is being shared family style anyway.

We had two children in our group and felt pressured to pop for the $4.99 kid's Cioccolata and Pisa Punch served in glasses with flashing lights in their base. The lids were poorly designed, subject to spillage around the straw, but the kids did enjoy the beverages. $10 of enjoyment? Well. At least refills were free. 

Ordering the right amount of food from the family style menu can be tricky. The portions are generous, so it's easy to order too much. For example, our server's recommendation to share a small salad for four adults was perfect, even though the written menu would have suggested the larger size. I'd recommend getting some friends together and ordering several small entrees for variety,

I'd also recommend just letting kids share the adult family style entrees rather than ordering from the children's menu (unless they just have to have macaroni and cheese). The four and five year olds in our party were fine with it and it helped them feel fully part of the group. They weren't quite as supportive, however, when we refused to order the giant brownie sundae. I was willing, but..."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience from beginning until end. Devante our sever was quick, polite and very knowledgeable. Our food was hot and delicious! The pizza and antipasto salad amazing! All of the staff was very attentive including the manager Norrese! They all made sure we enjoyed our experience and food. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and for the most part, the food has been good. It's pricey but you can find some nice offers from time to time. Went back tonight and I will say the service was terrible. At the beginning of the ordering process, I asked if a drink was included with a kids meal. The answer was yes. We then ordered the kids meal for my daughter, chicken parmigiana and spaghetti.  Got the Caesar salad as well.  Again, the food was good.  

But we ran out of water and sprite - had to flag another server to fill up the sprite. Never got the water replenished. Our server showed back up after a 20 minute hiatus - there were only 3 tables occupied by the way. She brought the bill and it had a $3.29 charge for the kids drink. I showed to the server thinking it was merely a mistake. She then said since we brought it in a big cup, there was an up charge. Hmm.. told her we didn't ask for a large cup and if that was a small up-charge, then was full price? She said no problem, she would take care of it. 

She takes my card and rings it up - brings back the bill where she did remove the $3.29 but then charged my $1.99.  Well - glad the restaurant got the $2 for the kids drink. Server got a paltry tip as a result. Honestly, lucky I left one at all.  Hour and a half meal when there was no one there. 

With that said, we will go back as we like the food. But only with a good offer / coupon. If the service was good here, would easily be a 4 Star place."}
{"text":"Eh.... just average, but really it's how i feel about all Bucca De Bepo's. 
We came to this location for our one year anniversary OnLY because we had a gift card. From my experiences w Bucca i knew the food had much to be desired so I sought the advice from my fellow Yelpers on what to order, maybe there was something i was missing out out on. So i tried the Ceasar salad that someone said was the best they'd ever had, which makes me sad for her. It was far from the best, the lettuce was wilted and soggy. I went on my own for the main dish. I forgot the name of it, but it was a spicy shrimp pasta dish. It was pretty good. My son ordered the fetticcini Alfredo. The sauce was clumpy and lacked flavor. Decided to try the highly recommended tiramisu. I was expecting a slice but got a huge bowl (i know, duh I'm at Bucca). Again it was ok. Nothing to rave about. Then again i doubt anything can beat the tiramisu that i had at an Italian Deli in San Fran. 
Overall... service and food was, like i said, eh."}
{"text":"Three times I called for a waiter because our food was cold. Blatantly ignored. Do not eat here"}
{"text":"Food was great and our server was spunky ? is go again. Prices were about par for what we got ? both people really have to agree on one meal, which was weird, since one order is to feed 2-3 people."}
{"text":"My family and I have come here on several occasions (usually big groups) and have thoroughly enjoyed our experiences, but it has been at least 5-6 years since I last dined here. The visit I am reviewing was for take-out. I used their order ahead system and was given a time of 6:11 for my order to be ready. Nearly 30 minutes after that time, my order was still not ready. I kept being assured that it was \"almost ready\" multiple times. People came and went... still no food for me. I was picking up food for a few friends, so I kept them waiting as well. When I finally mentioned how long I had been waiting, they comped my salad, but the food still did not appear.

Some things I noticed during my extended time sitting in the lobby:
The hostess was NEVER at her station. The young lady working the take-out counter continuously had to leave her post to assist customers coming in who needed to be seated. There were times when customers were left standing in the lobby waiting for more than five minutes before someone appeared to seat them. Other staff members (kitchen staff and wait staff coming off duty?) walked through the lobby but never addressed these customers (a simple, \"Are you being helped?\" or \"Someone will be with you shortly,\" or even \"Hello, welcome to Buca di Beppo,\" would have been nice. I also noticed wait staff sitting at the bar chatting and flirting. This was a Tuesday night and the restaurant wasn't busy, but still wait staff sitting at the bar? One girl was even reapplying makeup and fixing her hair.

When my food finally came, the rigatoni looked like all the ingredients were just thrown in a pan. It was barely warm even when I first got it, and totally cold by the time I got to my friends just 10  minutes later. The salad (chopped antipasto) was very nice and tasty. The chocolate cake was HUGE and very chocolatey delicious. The garlic cheese bread was cold, not cheesy, and just plain old soggy.

It appears this location has a serious management issue. The will continue to get customers because of the chain's reputation, but that will only last so long.

Everyone's entitled to a bad night... they will get another chance from me, but just one more. I am generally a positive person and most of my reviews are 3 or 4, but this particular visit earns a 2... barely."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It is a bit noisy but I like the kitschy decor. I had a reservation for 10 & the hostess had the table ready. The  prices are a little steep but I like the fact that everyone can try a bit of each dish/entree. 
Parking was a bit tight - the parking lot isn't very big. Food was decent and the staff was very friendly. No surly waiters or waitresses at this establishment."}
{"text":"Terrible Terrible Terrible!  Went on Mother's Day and the service was terrible the food was terrible!!  We went at 7pm and weren't served until 9pm with absolutely no one in the restaurant left!  The manager was a bobble head saying I am sorry with no actual care behind it!!  Worst experience ever we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Always a good time with some good food and awesome service. The food is delicious and authentic and the workers here are always very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Love this place and family friendly! The food is spectacular with a great menu !!! The best Italian food  in Vegas and I've been to a lot of Italian restraunts and always go back to Buca De Beppo!"}
{"text":"We had a company dinner here and the family style was perfect. Drinks were also very good. Good selection of beer. Only thing I. Would recommend is to lessen the time between courses. Too long of a wait."}
{"text":"*Update: 2 stars down to 1 star
The owner of the restaurant commented on this post and told me to message her directly. I did so and she never got back to me. One thing is consistent about this place: bad service. 

I love the Buca di Beppos from Cleveland and Columbus so I expected the Pittsburgh one to be consistent, but the poor service tarnishes this location. The host and other waitresses were friendly enough but our particular waitress was sloppy and pretty terrible overall. 

I came in for my birthday dinner and left with a disappointed experience. 
Waitress mistakes/incompetencies:
-sneakily charged us for the garlic bread when we straight up asked whether this was an appetizer. Her exact answer was \"No, it's not an appetizer but did you want to make it one?\" Such a weird response so we ordered it, thinking it was free. NOPE. $7.99 for about 6 chunks of bread. Toasty and garlicky but totally not worth it
-proclaimed that she would sing for my birthday and I replied \"yeah, bring it on!\" She asked the couple seated next to us if I would like her to sing twice and I said \"only once is fine...\" VERY odd way of doing this...and for the rest of the meal she did not sing at all. False advertisement!
-I opted to create my own pasta and she didn't put in 2 of the main ingredients: mild sausage and poached garlic. On the receipt, it was clear that it was her own fault b/c those ingredients weren't not entered. UGH!
-had NO idea how coupons worked and asked me to show her over and over again my coupon emails. Went back and forth and even told me to make an electronic reservation online in order to activate the coupon. What? Definitely unnecessary and did not work. 
I forgot her name but she wore her wispy blond her in a messy bun and had a lackluster attitude. 

The food itself tasted fine and the portions were large but really was hoping this place would start offering free bread. Also, walking through the open kitchen to get to the bathroom seems unhygienic and totally bad fengshui. I'm probably never coming back to this location.
*Note- my husband still tipped over 20% on our bill even though there was no reason to..."}
{"text":"This place is an original.  They are very welcoming and give you a tour of the kitchen before you're seated.

The portions are enormous!  Everything is served family style.  It comes with service utensils and it's meant to be passed around the table and shared.  I was confused about the menu, as everything is ala cart.  I think it's supposed to mimic a big Italian family style dinner on your table.  

The bread is soft and yummy.  I never had it with oil and vinegar; it was great.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana and you get no pasta with that.  So if you want pasta you have to order a side, which can get pricey.  For two people it was $70.  

Now the pasta was rather bland and they didn't have the fresh cheese to grate on top.  My chicken was outstanding!  My dinner mate enjoyed her mountain of lasagna too.  All the food was much too heavy on the garlic, but the vegetables were fresh and the meats were of excellent quality. 

The ambiance was eclectic with really unique, fun pictures everywhere.  A lot of thought went into this place.  
Having said that, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that on this day, the place had a horrible odor about it.

To be polite I will just say... The ladies bathroom was really NOT GOOD!  I will not go into further details here, but I can mention the towel dispenser was broken.  To be honest, the bathroom made me want to flee.  The stalls in the restrooms is the reason they earned a mere three stars.  The commodes nearly made me sick.  

You decide for yourself, but respectfully I will say that unless the ladies room and malodorous smell are attended to I would not go back there.  I can still say...  This place was a very unique dining experience."}
{"text":"I waited 15 minutes for service. Place was empty! I don't they will survive. I'm not sure why on a Monday no staff? Did not try the food but I guess similar too other Buccas?"}
{"text":"The good: a LOT of food and fair pricing for the money. Their desserts are just stupid large. Friendly wait staff.

The not-so-good: the pasta is just OK and I usually have to ask for more sauce. The chicken parm is inconsistent from visit to visit.

I think this place might be best served to come as a medium-sized group (maybe 6-10 ppl) after work to just sit, laugh it up, eat decent grub and mostly be able to enjoy each other's company in a campy setting. Because every entree is intended to serve people in multiples of two, it makes things difficult because if 2 people want 2 different entrees then they end up with enough food to feed at least 4 people.

If the occasion called for it, I'd come back. But, in my present circumstance - 2 diners - I'm opting for places where each of us can pick what we really want rather than have to compromise."}
{"text":"Jarrett was an awesome server! He made my daughter's 18th birthday special! He was on top of everything! We didn't want for anything. Thanks Jarrett!!!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, the inconsistency in the food and service is appalling. Buca makes you sign a contract for a large party prior to making a reservation, which is fine, but they failed to uphold their own terms of the contract. We were due to be seated at 7:30 pm, but they were not prepared for our party and we had to wait an hour. The bread and salads were okay, nothing special. They only gave 4 butters for 3 loaves per basket. The food, fettuccine Alfredo, a sausage ziti and chicken limon. The fettuccine was over peppered, cold noodles and the sauce made me feel like I was licking a chalkboard. The sausage ziti wasn't too bad, not nearly as good as other Buca's I have been to. The chicken was cold and had to be returned because it was not safe to serve. We had 2 members of the party with celiac, and had notified, in the contract that we would need gluten free food for them. The service staff, and who I assume was the manager forgot, and then became combative and defensive when we pointed out that they had not received their meals 20 minutes after our entrees were served. There are plenty of other places to eat in Vegas, please don't waste a dime here. Please also note that the servers Jenny and PJ were awesome, attentive, and handled the situations well. The rest of the staff in fact, did not."}
{"text":"This is an update for my last review. Last time the food and service was bad. This time I ordered take out with the gift cert. the manager gave me for 30 bucks. This time got the large penne ala vodka and cannolis (IDK if I spelled it right.) This review might be biased because I am NYC and im not a food snob, I guess, it just that the food is not that much better than olive garden. First the penne. The sauce was not as creamy as I thought it should, it was thick. Also, it was very peppery (Pepper flakes). I know what you are thinking, I have a sensitive pallet. I don't. I actually stopped eating spicy foods because the only way I could tell if something is spicy, is if I start to sweat. As I was eating it I asked my wife if it were spicy because I was sweating, she took 3 bites and could not eat it because of how spicy it was. I ate it and all the left overs, because it wasn't gross, just boring. And for 33 bucks for a large pasta to be boring kind of sucks. Now, the cannolis. They were good no complaints about the taste, but, they only filled the edges of the shells with the cream. I understand they give out 3 cannolis and they need to not waste the money, but, give me 2 cannolis completely filled and please maybe cut out some of the chocolate sauce drizzle. Like I said, this review could be biased because I lived in NYC before coming here and the crappiest Italian food there is better then the food I had here."}
{"text":"We used to frequent Buca di beppo at least once every other month a few years ago, as it was the \"new\" place to dine for us coming from Olive garden. Back then we thought the pricing was a little high for the amount of food you get. Just went back and realized the prices have gone up about $5 an entree which is family style. But the portion sizes haven't gotten bigger. The stuffed prosciutto chicken is hardly stuffed with anything and it was dry as a bone. I'm beginning to think the prices were raised to sort of offset the $10 coupon that you can get quite frequently. Example of over pricing. $39.99 for large chianti braised short ribs. The are good, but you get 3 small pieces to share with your family.  Same goes for all the meat entrees. The pasta, salad and pizza are good and that's what we will stick to. I want to give it 1 or 2 stars for the pricing."}
{"text":"Great place! Since it was located in the resort & casino I assumed it would be subpar. Well I was wrong. Server Chris was VERY helpful and kind."}
{"text":"I have to say, I expected it to be much better and I won't be going back.  We decided to take our 5 year old for her birthday and there were many disappointments.  1st, our chicken and pasta dish hardly had any chicken.  I did tell the waiter, and they did bring extra chicken, but the dish overall was just okay for the amount of money they charge.  2)  Maybe this place is only good for big parties, but not so much for 2 1/2 people.  I wanted a little desert and a \"happy birthday song\" to give to my daughter.  I was told they did not have little deserts, that they only had the ones on the menu that we could purchase to go along with their happy birthday song.  The deserts are huge (too big for 2 1/2 people) and the cheapest was 13 dollars, so we didn't purchase one.  They did come and sing happy birthday to her, at the very least they could have given her a little scoop of ice cream (I would have even paid for it), but it was all (an expensive all) or nothing in this case.  My little girl even said \"where is a cake\" after they sang to her.  Note to restaurant, if you have a small party that isn't in the position to get a large and expensive desert for a kids birthday dinner, please have a smaller option or compromise so a little kid does not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here on Christmas day and that was a big mistake. I honestly don't think any restaurant should take reservations if they can't handle the amount of business they'll get. 

We got there 20 minutes before our scheduled reservation time at 5:30. The hostess was very sweet and she seated it right away. They sat us in a 6 person booth. But, there was so much crap on the table that it felt like we were dining at a 4 person table. After we were seated, it took our server a few minutes to get to us. We get it, it's super busy! However, the server we got had a major attitude. She was very curt and fast w/ us even when we were asking questions about the menu. We just brushed it off because we understand it was busy! 

But, an attitude like that can get super annoying QUICK. She took our food. Every time she came by she would serve us w/ the biggest grumpy face I'd ever seen. I've worked at a restaurant before and I always tried to be nice even if it's busy. Life is too short to be a sour pus. 

The food was okay. We got the platter, spicy chicken rigatoni, supremo Italiano pizza, stuffed shells and tiramisu. Everything was okay. The platter was the best thing on the menu. It comes w/ fried calamari and shrimp. They ran out of mozzarella sticks so they gave us extra calamari and shrimp to make up for it. The shrimp had a nice kick to it. 

Spicy chicken rigatoni was cooked too al dente for my taste. The sauce was not spicy at all. The portion was HUGE! We weren't able to finish all of it. 

Supremo Italiano pizza was ok. We got a small portion that was perfect for us all to enjoy along w/ the appetizer. 

The stuffed shells were good especially w/ the marinara sauce it came with. 

The biggest downer was the tiramisu. It was NASTY. They made a special \"Holiday\" tiramisu that looked and tasted terrible. Normally, it comes in a nice bowl w/ chocolate powder on top. This time we just got a slice that they just threw on a plate. 

Overall, the experience was okay and I'm only giving them this because I know it was Christmas and it was very busy. The service was sub-par. They did the bare minimum. The food was meh except two things. 

I will not come here again though for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Awful. We were there with a party of seven  and our server straight up refused to split our bill into two separate checks. It's not like we were asking him to split it seven different ways, just into two different bills.  Seriously, I've been a server. It isn't that difficult. Soooo we decided not to eat there and my husband and I left. If you don't want my business, I will go elsewhere. There are enough good restaurants in Las Vegas that care about their business that I don't need to eat at this kitschy tacky mess with poor service. 

Also, my friend ordered a soda and it took our server thirty minutes to get that and to get straws for the table.

Aaa and the server kicked my chair every damn time he walked by."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend a few weeks ago after watching the USA Basketball Olympics exhibition at Thomas and Mack.  The food is pretty cool.  I really have no complaints.  They give HUGE portions that you can basically share with 5-6 people per dish.  Spaghetti with meatballs was my preferred dish.  We also had the cheese sticks amongst others.  

It's pretty consistent with the other Buca di Beppo's across the country.  I go to the one in San Diego and it taste pretty similar."}
{"text":"When we checked in for our 5PM reservation, we were warned that computers were down, several workers \"no-showed\" and the kitchen was VERY behind (and that our food could take up to 2 hours). 

Since we had reservations there and nowhere else to go, we decided to stick it out.
The food took every bit of two hours and them some.  It was Christmas, I was not about to be nasty like some of the other grouchy people around us. (PEOPLE, YOU WERE WARNED). 

In fact- I heard the host/manager telling \"everyone\" as they were checking in for their reservations that \"your food will take a LONG time, be prepared.\" Clearly some people thought he was joking around.

I feel our server Colin did the best he could, he was serving tables, working the bar and generally running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Our son fell asleep waiting. We laughed about it. Colin kept our coffee hot. We made him smile, I could tell he wanted to hang himself. I thought about his family and how they probably wanted to spend Christmas with him and he's dealing with us idiots instead.

Merry Christmas to the staff that was working so hard and basically abused by the public. I feel for you. I probably will just stay in and cook next year. People are mean.

I knocked off a few stars because the food was \"average\". Certainly not Mom's lasagne, but not Stouffer's either."}
{"text":"I have been to buca di beppo multiple times, and this time was by far my worst! We walked in and the waitress Kimberly was not very accommodating she was rude throughout the whole dining experience. It was me and 3 other friends we were excited to come out to dinner we ordered 3 pasta dishes and drinks, the drinks didn't even come till after we had our dinner. One of the pasta dishes was very undercooked. Overall I don't think I would come back to this restaurant In Las Vegas or anywhere else for that matter. To give a final comment my experience was negative all around."}
{"text":"I've ate here several times and it was always good but our meal today was horrible. The mixed salad was good but the bruschetta bread was soggy. It took so long to get our food we had them pack it to go. Later when we sat ate it the chicken in pasta tasted bad, even the lasagna tasted bad. My daughter said her chicken parmigiana tasted like dirt. All the meal was a waste, threw it all out. Waste of money and it was not cheap $120."}
{"text":"Well place has a lot of nice pics of history and well dressed up. The waitress was very professional , the Maitre d was young and not very good. Side salad was very good but small. The main order is for like two people or more , and the noodles were good noodles but meat sauce was little burnt and not much of it.  Bread was ahh...

I might go back but only if that was all that was open, for Italian .
Chain restaurant..."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and the food is absolutely delicious! We always order the same thing, muscles and seafood pasta after a long hard day of work, and it's ALWAYS order to go. 
We came once and I believe I waited PATIENTLY for over 45 minutes when I was told it would be ready right when I had got there. I know how it is when it's busy, lobby or waiting room is jam packed with everyone waiting- angry. So I just waited and waited. What upset me most was that not once did anyone offer me a water while I waited. People coming in after me were leaving before me. I was tired and worked my butt off that day, I was cranky and so hungry! I was going to rate them 1 star until after today. Rafael is the one who helped me and he remembered me from the previous time I had been there waiting patiently. He apologized and owned up to a mistake on his end but thanked me for being so patient. He then offered a dessert on the house. 5 stars because of you mister Rafael! You definitely show great customer service and integrity!"}
{"text":"Visited for dinner on June 12.  Floor in dining area was absolutely filthy.  Our server was mostly MIA.  Food is only okay and the designed \"large\" portions really do not work very well for a couple who do not intend to gorge themselves.  Would not recommend this to anyone desiring quality Italian food and quality service."}
{"text":"I come here every year for my birthday and this year Jarrett made sure we had an amazing time, lots of wine and great pictures. Thanks Buca!"}
{"text":"This place has always been one of my more favorite places to eat over the years.  Last night was the exception.

There were 9 of us for very special 15th birthday party dinner for Ashley.  We also broke Stan (Ashleys Grand Ffather) out of his rehabillitation facility to join us as a family meal would not be complete without him.  For dinner and we had a slew of food, all of which was great as expected, see below. 

The down side was the service.  It was just terrible!  The waitress added in the 18% gratuity so knowing full well she was going to get paid well for a large party, paying attention to us was a second thought.  There were far too many other tables to attend to where the gratuity would have to be earned and not just added on automatically.  

Both Melissa and Ryan had to play \"waitress/waiter\" and get refills for our water and ice tea, as if this was something they were reuired to do.  Where was our waitress?  Who knew?

As far as the food goes, we had 2 trays of Calimari, Cheesey Garlic Bread and a large mixed salad.  Delicious!

For the entree we chose Lobster Spaghetti, Chicken Carbonara and Baked Ziti.  Again, Delicious!  The Carbonara was the bomb!!  

The food alone is what allows this to rate a 2 star evening.  The service tore it apart and stopped any kind of positive statement to be made.  Sorry guys, you need to get your wait staff in check.  

We brought  our own dessert, a store bought birthday cake which allowed us to opt out of their offerings.  They are usually quite good though!

Overall, I still love this place for the quality of the food and will certainly go back.  Lets see how they change by the next time we all return.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Just updating my review of this place.

After having a rather unpleasant experience here with staff telling me they were closed when in fact they weren't, the manager contacted me saying he was concerned, gonna send me comps if I took it down blah blah blah

Well I never heard from him, again. This place is a joke. I guess I'll call corporate? Don't say you're gonna send me something and then not follow through. 

Jerks."}
{"text":"Pretty Disappointed!!
We believe the server forgot to put in our order since several tables behind us had been eating for awhile before our food came out. Baked ziti was very dry, chicken limos was good but lacked the lemon flavor. 
Overall not very impressed and may not be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Bucca in 10+ years. I remember why now. I ordered the chicken marsala with green beans. The dish came and WOW it's maple syrup with mushrooms, NOT marsala sauce. I'm a cook so I know what marsala sauce is supposed to be. This was gross. In addition the restaurant was nearly empty but yet we received the slowest service possible. I'm pretty amazed, but, yes, Bucca Di Beppa has sank lower than Olive Garden. Pretty impressive."}
{"text":"We went to eat there with the NCO, expectations were low. The bread came out of the fridge and was cold. The antipasto had no meat. The pasta was asked to be cooked al dente, it wasn't, it wasn't even drained! We had 1/2\" of water at the bottom of our bowl. It had NO sauce, I am not exaggerating! We asked for sauce \"it's being cooked right now\" WHAT?! We had no pepper flakes at the table and had to ask for them and share them with another table. The service was ok. I hate this place it's a huge rip off. $25 for a pasta bowl which had about $1 worth of pasta and about 1/2 can of tomatoes at best. Stay home and open a can of ragú you'll be eating better than at this place. Terrible."}
{"text":"My new favorite local sit down restaurant for Italian food. My husband surprised me for a date here and was impressed. They have good sized portions that serve 3 people (or more depending the size you order) per plate for a really good price. Definitely good for leftovers. The pasta was delicious and the service was good. The restaurant is quiet and cozy so it's great for conversation and talking. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Ok, this was my first time there. A little pricey, but it is all served family style. It is not the best Italian food I have ever had, but it was pretty good and definitely filled me up, with some leftovers for sure. The service was great and will definitely be going back. Go with an appetite and if you are not on a budget."}
{"text":"This place has no consistency. Sometimes the food is great, and most times it is ridiculously bad. We got take out and ordered the Caesar salad, garlic bread, chicken parm, and baked rigatoni. The Caesar was fine, the garlic bread was SO garlicky that ONE piece was enough. The chicken parm we thought was going to be promising based on looks alone because the chicken pieces were HUGE tasted like those frozen chicken patties you get out of the grocery store. It did not taste like chicken at all, more like a breaded piece of rubber. Then the baked rigatoni... we can always count on the baked rigatoni to be good. Nope. It was dry.. crunchy... no flavor. I'm not kidding the WORST thing ever. This almost $80 meal I got was so bad,  I went to pasta idea across the parking lot the next day to try to forget that whole thing happened. Pasta Idea didn't disappoint. Buca has taken my money for the LAST TIME!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service! We came for a late lunch and told the waiter that today is my birthday (true) and in the end they surprised me with a desert and they all song a funny meatball song for me!!! Loved it!!!! Thank you guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Out to rip you off. I recommended this place to friends based on my good experiences back home. The four of them made a reservation and were having dinner when we joined them. The hostess tried to tell us we couldn't sit down when there were two empty seats at their table. We ordered two glasses of wine as recommended by the server and were handed a bill for $34. That's right, they charged us $17 a glass for the house wine. We're here for a week. Not only will we not be returning but will be telling everyone here at the conference to avoid yet another Las Vegas ripoff."}
{"text":"This is a family style chain place with old school attitude.  Most cities only have one or two locations, and a table can require some patience at busy times.  Pagers help, you can sit outside or smoke.  Italian dishes are uniformly above average and border on greatness.  Things like the cheesecake that tastes like soap and chalk ruin it.  The indifferent service here after a night with a spectacular server in Plano, Texas made me want to turn the car around and never eat here in Charlotte.  I can wait until I leave town."}
{"text":"This is the second time in a year we had a birthday celebration and the air condition was not working . The upper floor and the pope room were extremely HOT . The waitstaff was  literally drenched with sweat .  When a  Restraunte has  multiple floor fans on hand it says this is an on going problem .  No one enjoys eating Italian food in a 90 degree room !!!!  Our party could not wait to leave due to the room temp.  Love this place but will not return to this station square location . Fix this problem"}
{"text":"Food was average, large portions aka \"family style\" service was lacking and bread was cold."}
{"text":"Worst experience. I went with my boyfriend and his parents and waited about 10 minutes before our server even greeted us.  We waited for over an hour for our food and when we had mentioned how long we were waiting, our server blamed the kitchen, not having food runners, that they were just busy, etc.  The waiter didn't even bring refills when we asked. Finally our waiter brought SOME of our entrees and sarcastically stated he didn't want us to starve.  He said our order was still waiting on an entree that was still being baked. We proceeded to our entrees which were cold and dried out and you could clearly tell that they were just sitting in the window.  As we were explaining to our waiter how all the food was cold and dried out another server brought the baked dish that we were waiting for and obviously heard us complaining about the situation and sarcastically told us how the dish was hot because it was freshly out of the oven. At that point we asked for a manager and he said he'd get one.  We continued to wait for at least another 10 minutes before anyone even came back to our section. We asked the next employee that came into our section if we could please get a manager. She said that they were waiting for him.  At this point the table across from us also started complaining about the food and lack of service. The proceeded to put all their food on the edge of the table to be removed. After another 5 minutes going by and still no manager or even an employee telling us a manager is on the way, we decided to just get up and leave.  We passed our waiter on the way out and he was busy cleaning an empty table.  We told him we were leaving and all he had to say was, \"ok\".  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?  Now, we're here eating at FIREBIRDS with exceptional food and exceptional service.  As many times as we've eaten there and ordered takeout, unfortunately we will NOT be giving them our business."}
{"text":"Decent food, extremely overpriced. Slow wait service. Waiter was extremely friendly, yet exceptionally slow.?"}
{"text":"It's a totally different experience. By far way better than Oreganos, the food actually tastes homemade. We tried the mixed green salad, mozzarella garlic bread & the baked lasagna with some sangria wine. Everything was awesome I loved the marinara sauce it's just perfect. 

It is a bit pricy but totally worth it, enjoyed every single bite of the meal. The place is very decorous and it gives you that Italian experience."}
{"text":"Buca di beppo is one of my favorite Italian restaurants. Everytime we eat there, it's absolutely delicious! I love the family style dining, they've also added individual portions. Although the selection for single servings isn't horrible, it's not fabulous, either. Busy or slow, our service and food has always been wonderful, never a complaint. I'd recommend Buca's to anyone, try it, you'll see why!"}
{"text":"Wow that was a bad lunch decision!

Came here for some real Italian lasagna and got something less than adequate. Such nice appointments all around this place and very home-like, warm feel with good waitstaff. But the food... My goodness. 

The bread - cold and uneventfully tasteless.
Lasagna - breaking down the ingredients 
Tomato sauce - excitingly visual but way too sweet
Cheeses - mediocre and unappealing.
Pasta - equally bland like something from a large grocery store.
The meat - like something from a popular chain taco fast food joint.

Overall - horribly disappointing"}
{"text":"There comes a time in nearly every chain restaurant when something goes wrong. You can tell a good restaurant from a bad one by the way they handle it.  We experienced this first hand a few weeks ago.  We ordered the Bucatini Ala Enzo, Pancetta, Prosciutto, button mushrooms, peas and pasta.  Well while eating, I discovered wax paper still on the prosciutto.  I informed our waitress who apologized and went to find out what it was.  While she was gone, we found several more pieces.   The manager came out, apologized, explained what it was, offered us a replacement entree and comped our meal.  There you have it, a well handled mess.  We love Buca, the portions are worth it, the prices are value for the amount of food you get, and usually the quality is above average, especially for a chain.  They handled this situation very well and we were left satisfied that it would be safe to come back again.  Till next time..."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. We Went on lunch on Thursday and were the first customers.  We Got our drink orders and food orders taken care of right away.  Then nothing, no coming to refill our drinks or to let us know our food was going to take a while.  We got our food after 40 minutes we immediately asked for the checks and to go boxes.  The waitress apologized for how long everything took and still took a total of 15 minutes to check us out and give us our boxes.  My g
Food was good, I got the spicy rigatoni.  My friends who got the spaghetti complained of the noodles having no flavor and the sauce tasted like just plain tomatoes with no seasoning at all. I called bucca to complain and they didn't answer and I'm still waiting to hear from corporate since Thursday.  very disappointed especially since this was a work birthday lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Our server, Jerret was the best! Very patient, polite and efficient. He's very personable and treated us like family. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Great experience! The food is delicious! Ask for Norrese and Victoria. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Huge servings, excellent friendly service, our waiter Ben gave incredibly spot on recommendations, and is a major reason I will  come back to Buca!"}
{"text":"OMG!  What a disaster.  My wife and I along with two friends decided to try this restaurant as we hadn't been there in a few years.  Upon arrival it smelled like sewer in the lobby when we asked if they had a sewer problem they said they would have to check into it.  We were seated and given a stack of menus.  I asked my friends if they wanted to leave but they said it was my birthday so it was my choice.   We stayed.  I passed them out, however, when I opened mine there was what looked like vinegar and oil all over the inside of my menu.  The waiter was notified and replaced the menu.  We ordered a small  pasta with marinara sauce, a small salad, mozzarella garlic bread and a chicken saltimbocca dish.  The salad came immediately and the garlic bread did not make it out for another 5 minutes after the salad was gone.  The waiter brought out dinner plates which I passed out.  My plate was clearly not cleaned as it had crusty stuff still clinging to the plate.  The plate was replaced.  The pasta and chicken dishes were bland and tasteless.  The only good part of the meal was the salad and garlic bread.   For this experience we paid $68.03 plus $12.00 tip.   My advice STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Great place , highly recommend for either a fun date or for a family gathering. Family size portions. It's just like a typical Italian dining room themed. Tons of black & white pictures on the wall, ya get a quick tour of their kitchen , it's tw floors, great wine list....ohhh just go and check it out, you won't regret it. Enjoy when you do."}
{"text":"What is going on at Buca in Chandler? For the last few months it seems things aren't running as smooth as they used to. I often frequent this business and spend a lot of money here but have slowed down because of the \"lack of\". In the last few months I have ordered to go more often. Here's what my issues have been - missing food (no meatballs with my \"build your own\"), I used to order a small dinner/ enough for 3 people but portions have shrunk - I got home last night with dinner for 3 of us and the meal was cold/ small and only got one loaf of bread (couldn't feed 3 on this), cold meals - it normally is cooked and ready to serve but last night I had to come home and heat it because it was cold/ not even room temp, no one answering the phone - I called 3 times yesterday/ 3 times a charm. The dinning in is always great because their waiters and waitresses are Great but they seem short handed at all times lately. It seems they lack management support. I believe if the team needs help, it should be the managers job to chip in/ hands on. I don't really see that here. I honestly love Buca but am considering not making this \"my one and only Italian place\". Before this, you would never see me considering that option. Sad but true."}
{"text":"Shocked by the level of service on our visit.

We ordered to start Caesar Salad and arrived with some bread after we asked for bread.  We then ordered the Chicken Limone with the capers on the side as one person in our party is allergic to them and another one is just opposed to the taste.  The Chicken Limone arrived with the capers on top and spread throughout the dish.  I informed Andrea that we ordered it with the capers on the side; she apologized for this and brought the dish back to the kitchen.  The next actions which occurred had me completely shocked as well as puzzled because Buca di Beppo is such a fine establishment with a completely amazing reputation for the high quality of food and service you provide.  Watching the kitchen, the expeditor grabbed a pair of tongs, took a piece of chicken dumped off the capers and put on a new plate which is when I got up to look closer and saw him do this with the rest of the chicken.  A server then went to bring this back to our table; which is when a manager asked me if there was a problem.  I informed him of the actions I had just witnessed and he said first that would not have happened which I told him I saw this action with my own eyes and then he asked the expeditor whom confirmed the actions.  A new dish was brought to our table maybe 15 minutes later if not more - where our children had already finished their food.  

Scared to think this is a company norm."}
{"text":"Amazing, over the top attention. They catered to the needs of our demanding toddler grandchildren. Good was remarkable and the service was top notch. We had a poor experience and the managers asks to make it up. Boy did they! The best part was the great service started BEFORE they knew who we were. Amelia is our go to server! Ask for her and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"The main course was very good, but we ended up sending the side back.  Would not recommend for a romantic night out.  We were sat in the bar section and were told it was the quietest section in the restaurant.  Maybe better for large groups, otherwise it's like ordering buffet food.  If i want a buffet, I will go to one.  All meals are in minimum servings for 2 people."}
{"text":"Service here to the food is just mediocre, taking my wife and 2 daughter here for dinner tonight because we had a email offer and gift card and still end up paying $60.00 something for the food and another 20.00 for tip well not worth it. The spaghetti with meatballs was bland no taste what so ever even prego spaghetti sauce taste better than what we had tonight, the service was ok we had to ask for bread that came out cold and kept asking for refills. We both work in the service industry and this is unacceptable service and food needs help BIG time. How can you mess up on spaghetti and meatballs???"}
{"text":"The service was slow. We had to get up and get our own flatware. Chicken carbonara was excellent and portion was very generous. We had to ask for one of our beverages when our meal came, server brought one and did not return with the second one."}
{"text":"I only give it a second star because I like the atmosphere, seating and cozy/social feel.  I also liked that the waitress walks you through the kitchen to get to your table.

That was the upside.  Here is the downside.  As you can tell from other reviews it is very pricey.  If you are looking for good Italian kitchen family style food you must go to Maggiano's, 5 star and you get a ton more food for the same price as this joint.  The service tonight was slow and I didn't expect that since we came in after the rush.  The waitress seem experienced but she only pretended to care.  She seem as if she could not be bothered by us even after we introduced ourselves as first time customers.

We ordered the Chicken Limone and it was very dry.  Enough said.  The spicy chicken (insert your favorite little Italian pasta name here) was pretty good. 

My wife asked what I thought and I said it was okay but I wouldn't exactly come running back."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT here ! Save your money and go anywhere else ! After work I was starving so me and my bf went here at 9:01pm given they close at 10. When we got there 4 different people tried to find us a table and the whole restaurant was empty ? It also constantly smelt like a sewer ..... Whatever ....,,,they had already closed the bar which was wrapped in plastic wrap from head to toe ? Weird...we kinda wanted to sit at the bar .... but as we sit down are server was nice I guess but defiantly already thought he was done for the night and appeared to be a little all over the place .. He brought us ice cold bread and we ordered a 40$ shrimp Parmesan . We get the plate minutes later and it's a giant plop of Goo. Now we were planing on paying 40$ for this so we figure it would have been like any other pasta dish with noodles ? Nope just a 40$ plop of cheese and frozen breaded shrimp . I ask about noodles and he says I can buy some for 12$ . We decide to eat it as is and first bite I spit it out . The shrimp are as chewy as beef jerkey and the plate is such a giant blob of god knows what it taste like dog food . We end up sending it back . The server dosent care . Next second we see him he has already taken off his work shirt and he's clearly over it . The kitchen was already wrapped in plastic wrap as well. Given it still isn't even 10 yet . I will say he bought my bf\"s beer , we still tipped him 20% anyways but this was the worst experience I've had at a restaurant given I was about to pay 40$$$$$ for a plop of melted cheese and some frozen breaded shrimp . I went to in and out burger instead and will never ever go back here ever and will tell anyone else to go anywhere else that's how horrible my experience was ."}
{"text":"Me and my Wife went to the Bucca Di Beppo inside the Excalibur and had a terrible experience. The food is very overpriced, the bread they brought out was cold plain white break that looks like they got it from a cheap supermarket, my baked ziti was dry on the top which tells me they either didn't make it fresh or it was sitting out for a long time and my Wife's veal tasted like rubber. Every time someone had a birthday there would be a waiter who would yell extremely loud and start singing, VERY disrupting. A woman choked in front of us and people were doing the Heimlich maneuver on her; not their fault, but just part of the overall negative experience and total waste of $60 for two rotten entrees."}
{"text":"My son chose Buca for his birthday dinner.  There were 7 of us total and the toal bill was around $200.  No alcohol was ordered.  I was surprised how expensive it was.  The food was so-so.  I think the \"schtick\" here is the family style entrees.  When you order spaghetti and meatballs, you get a huge bowl of spaghetti with 2 or 3 meatballs the size of of a softball.  The meatballs were not very good and it was kinda awkward dividiing them up.  I'd rather have 8-10 smaller meatballs to share.

The atmosphere of the place is great... very Italian feel.  Can't rival a joint in the North End of Boston but they try.

Suggestion to the restaurant - move your dumpster.  It sits prominently in the parking area on the same side as the main entrance.  And, if the wind works against you, you get a full blast of all kinds of wonderful smells.  Not good going in and certainly worse going out!"}
{"text":"This place is so much worse than the one I always go to in Santa Monica Ca. The baked ziti was not really baked. In Santa Monica, the actual plate is hot bc it's baked. This one in Vegas the plate was cold to the touch. The garlic bread for $5 was a waste of money it was awful. Food overall wasn't great here. Service was meh."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone is always so nice. The food is always great! Dinning or out we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Look, Buca di Beppo will never be confused for fine dining. But it being a family-friendly chain shouldn't preclude it from serving tasty dishes.

We went with the Spaghetti and Meatballs (\"our famous half-pound meatballs with our homemade marinara sauce\") as our main and it was, to put it mildly, a disappointment.

The food arrived at the table hardly hotter than warm, but that wasn't the biggest problem. No, the main issue was the unbelievably overcooked pasta. It was soft and mushy and I couldn't believe a restaurant would serve something of this caliber. The meatballs were tough and dry, while the marinara sauce was bland and tasteless.

Our side dish, Italian Broccoli Romano, was surprisingly tasty, though. The broccoli had a nice crunch, and the impressively plentiful garlic gave the dish an irresistible bite.

I probably wouldn't have found the main so objectionable if it hadn't been so expensive ($26.99!)"}
{"text":"I had really hoped to like this place but not so!  We are a one and done!  We chose this place because we had wanted to try them for a long time.  We had looked online at the lunch menu and the food looked good as well as the pricing for lunch.  When we arrived on a Saturday for lunch we were told that they have no lunch pricing and what was in the menu was definitely dinner pricing, this was the first thing that we were not thrilled with.  We decided to give them a try any way.  Had calamari for an appetizer and it was just so-so, ordered a large but that was not enough for more than 2, disappointed.  The food overall was just not that good, my fettuccine alfredo was bland, no fresh parmesan for the top and the noodles were all glued together, my mothers salad was good and that was about it.  All of us were so disappointed in the food. We paid $140 for lunch after a $15 coupon for 5 people and that is without TIP!  We will never go there again.  If you like the food at the other two well known places then save your money and time!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the large sized orders of Ceaser salad, meatball spaghetti, and baked ziti.  The taste of the marinara sauce and the texture of the meatballs made the food taste even better. Recommend getting a reservation before getting there. There was a huge line to be seated."}
{"text":"Went to a late lunch and was served by Dustin.  What a rude guy.  You would think a waiter would realize the nicer they are the better tip but I guess not.  Besides this attitude he had during the whole meal, he brings my tea and runs off with no sugar so after a few mins. I go get some for myself.  The food was good but he brought this partial loaf of bread and it looked like he took it from another plate and was cold and gross.  Next time he comes around I ask for a warm loaf and he starts saying something about they come like that but then says he will go warm it up like its some big deal.  This guy pretty much made our dining experience rather miserable with his miserable don't give a chit attitude.  If you don't like your job man, go find something different."}
{"text":"Reviews are all over the scale for this demi-Italian joint, but my experience here puts it on my Mediocre List.

Remember Leftover Night as a kid?  
You'd ask your mom what's for dinner and she'd open the fridge and say, \"Whatever you want -- we have spaghetti, salad, bread, there's a piece of fish, and some kind of meat.  Go to town.\"

Buca is kind of like that.  

The selection and portion sizes available to you are just wierd.  Plain and simple, I like getting what I want, not choosing from among the things that THEY want me to have.  I know all places have their menu's, but any illusion of getting something the way you want it is gone at Buca.
That makes me change my mind.  Buca is more like \"Leftover Night\" at a friend's house, choosing from among that other mom's dishes, which while familiar to you, were prepared in a way that just \"isn't like my mom makes it\".

The food is pretty good: hovering around average, but hearty.

The service is the standard fake-friendly.  I can't be sure if the extra touch of douchebag that our server exhibited was a personal trait or something they train.

The restaurant itself is oh so very annoying, with enough distracting wall decorations to paralyze a hard ADD case.  The layout is a bunch of ridiculous rooms, with doorways and stairways like a maze, and they march you through the kitchen to get to your seats -- an obnoxious bit of pretention that should be saved for an establishment that deserves it."}
{"text":"This place is delicious however it's not a place you go to alone or for a first date.

It's a family-style restaurant so each dish can serve more than 2 people. It's a great place to go to for a family event. It's kind of awkward going to place with friends because you can't really split the check on one dish. 

The bread was delicious and my waiter was helpful! 

I had the Penne Ala Vodka and the Mozzarella Caprese. Delicious! (I split this with three people and I still had some food left over to take home)"}
{"text":"As with all chains, I prefer to review this Buca compared to other locations and have that weigh heavily on the rating.

The service here is slow. 

When I walked through the kitchen they seemed very confused and disorganized. 

The carpets are old, worn, and dirty. 

Restrooms are not terribly clean, and in need of a major update. 

The food is OK - cookie cutter to all Bucas.  Reasonably good. Too bad it took an hour for food to show up. 

\"Only if you have to.\""}
{"text":"I went here tonight with the BF and his parents, as it was his Dad's birthday. The place is a chain, and so it feels like a chain... you know, that weird feeling that all the 'kitsch' on the wall is the same as the 'kitsch' on 500 other walls across the country.... The food was fine, nothing crazy awesome, but nothing that was bad. We had garlic bread, gnocchi, and manicotti. Everything was ok, nothing was too flavorful, but it was fine. We shared a pitcher, almost, of sangria, which was good. We also got the brownie sundae which was good... huge! Overall, the place was fine and not terribly expensive, so I would come back if the occasion was right. Oh, and it's awesome they're on open table cuz I got some points for making a reservation and I got to get seated without waiting without having to make an awkward phone call. So yay to that. 

Oh, and the waiter was also a friendly guy, so that was nice."}
{"text":"Where to begin? We ate there Sunday night and we were very disappointed. We come here very often and this was NOT a good experience. First, the hostess sat us at a table under which there was garbage all over the floor. Doesn't anyone sweep the floor? Really? Next, the manager asked us to move because they were expecting a large party and we were basically in the way. We said no. Next, the food orders were delivered to the wrong table and so my husband's dish arrived at least 10-15 minutes before mine. All in all, a very poor experience. We will think long and hard about going back to this restaurant. Too bad. We used to like this place."}
{"text":"First time to this chain today and it started out horrible but was redeemed by a hero. Went with my boyfriend and was very excited from referrals and reviews. Went in and saw a crowd of people waiting around for a party that was going for a birthday. Apparently they had been waiting around for a while for the upstairs to be prepped for them. My heart started to sink because we were very hungry. With no hostess in sight for 15 mins and only two people eating in a booth and two ladies at the bar my boyfriend went to find someone. A girl came back with him with a sour face and basically ignored us and disappeared upstairs with not a word to us or the large group waiting after my boyfriend let her know we just wanted a table if possible. After waiting another 10 minutes we just walked in and sat at the bar after asking a random waiter if its ok to eat at the bar. After realizing the bar chairs were very old and felt like they would break we asked the waiter if we can get a booth. He said we needed the hostess to get that fixed up,so we let him know what we had to deal with in the lobby. He politely apologized and left to find one. A short girl came out with RBF and sighed and let us know it would be 15 minutes. I was hungry and said ok then we can wait but im sure I looked very dissapointed because the same waiter that helped us earlier stepped in and sat us at a booth instead. His name is Jake and was the perfect picture of a waiter who took responsibility for the sour faced b***hes and got us drinks and menus right away. He saved the whole night for us and the food was great. We got the alfredo supremo and it was delicious. Jake always made sure we were fine and had plenty of bread and drinks. I normally never write reviews but felt Jake needed to be recognized for being awesome. I also wanted to point out those horrible hostesses/waitress who gave an air of \"not my problem\"."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! We don't mind paying extra for a nice dinner but this was extremely overpriced for what we got. The wine was subpar and overpriced, they ran out of meatballs but charged us anyway. Then blamed it on the PGA tour. We were seated immediately so they weren't that busy. The waiter wasn't attentive, esp for a restaurant at this price point. Then when we questioned it, the waiter said the garlic mashed potatoes that were substituted were more so he left the meatball in the bill.  Really? Mashed potatoes cost more than meatballs? We should have gone to Olive Garden for the meal we received. Not going back here again. I forgot.... when we first sat down, I put my hand in sauce in the seat. Good thing it wasn't my white pants!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday with my family today. We had a party of 7 and reserved a table for 4 pm. There was only 1 server for the entire dining room. The server was running all over, trying to handle all her tables so our service was rushed. We ordered a garden salad but got a Caesar salad. One of my party couldn't eat it because it has anchovies and he's allergic to fish. We didn't complain to our server because she was by herself and running ragged. One of our dishes was cold, but again, we didn't complain. Then after a $96 Bill (before coupon)we were going to pay the entire bill with 2 gift cards but we were told that the system only recognizes 90% of the gift card, not full value! Who does that???The WHOLE reason we went there was because we had gift cards. Then after running our cards, your system apparently wouldn't even take them! They were valid cards but  we ended up having to pay out of pocket for our meal. I can't blame the server because she did her best. 5pm on a Saturday night and 1 server?. Needless to say, my first visit to  Buca De Beppo was not very impressive at all. Shame on the manager. I expected better. And fix the gift card system. Wasn't a Happy birthday meal for me."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for Thanksgiving dinner and it was the best I've ever had...even better than family dinners at home.  I cannot attest to their standard menu of pasta and whatnot, but their Turkey, dressing, green beans, cranberry sauce, and garlic mashed potatoes all tasted fantastic and was reasonably priced.  The server as well as the management was quite friendly and helpful, with everything coming together to making for a great Thanksgiving experience."}
{"text":"I truly find the interior design of this restaurant to be borderline appalling. I don't know how you're supposed to enjoy your dinner with multicolored lights constantly giving you a headache. Perhaps it's enjoyable for some people (i.e. small children and people who are overly fond of 'busy' decoration), but I'm not one of them. The staff was rude and not really interested in giving you the time of day unless you were ordering copious amounts of alcohol. And the constant barrage of music rolling in from the casino downstairs was just adding insult to injury. 

We didn't try the food (so please don't use this review as a basis for that), but we did stop in for one of the \"giant brownie sundaes\". I will give them credit for having one of the largest sundaes I've ever seen. This thing was so big, in fact, that the four people at our table couldn't manage to finish it. The quality was so-so. The \"home-made\" brownie bites seemed more like something you'd get from a grocery store and the ice cream was okay, although I would have liked a better chocolate-to-vanilla ratio. 

Price-wise, it's not bad. You could definitely spend a lot more money for better food, but if you're on a budget and you don't mind the gaudy atmosphere and poor service this place may still be a good option for you."}
{"text":"Yesterday my friends and I decided to give this place a try for the lunch specials that they have to offer. We waited sometime before someone came and took our order, when the waitress came she wasn't too friendly [Name was Jackelyn] we ordered and waited and waited and waited finally we received our food. The pros to this place are that the portions are a very good size you will definitely take some leftovers home and it is very filling. The cons our waitress didn't come and check on us and when we asked of they did anything for your birthday she stated we just sing you have to purchase dessert...um okay, also let them know before if you want your check split or they will just assume one person is picking the tab up. Overall I gave this place 3 stars because the decor is awesome and the food was great."}
{"text":"My wife wanted me to come here so bad, I was not impressed at all. The food was not that great, it is like a overpriced Olive Garden.  Well I kind of like Olive Garden. Service was ok, it wasn't crowded but the waiter seemed overwhelmed. Think I'll pass on coming back."}
{"text":"The best customer service around! I chose Buca di Beppo in Pineville for my birthday dinner yesterday and I was not disappointed. The food was delicious AS ALWAYS, and our server, Matthew, took excellent care of us. This was our third time sitting in Matthew's section and each time he has been truly wonderful. While we were having dessert, Norrese, the assistant general manager came over to chat with us and when we told him that we were celebrating my birthday, he insisted on taking care of our tiramisu for us,  which is to DIE for, btw! Like how nice was that?!!! Norrese was so friendly with us and he truly wanted us to have a wonderful time there last night! I strongly recommend trying this place out as the food is delish and the people treat you like family!"}
{"text":"I think the food was good but not unique. The service was very good.  The decorations were very nice with maybe a little overkill. My only real complaint was that the booth smelled like mildew."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed meatballs were huge but bland tasted like they just rolled  hamburger into balls and added nothing to it .Calamari was rubbery which means it's overcooked. Very expensive and one of the worst Italian dinners we ever had. We were there June 13 2015"}
{"text":"For a large party, they were able to accommodate about 50 of us. 

I didn't like the bread. It didn't taste fresh and even trying to dip it in olive oil + balsaminic vinegar didn't help. Bread is so important, I wish it was tastier.

The caesar salad was good. So I am not sure what we ordered specifically because we got a special deal or something and we just got bunch of food. We had a penne pasta with white sauce that included chicken, peas, dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. It looks good but it didn't have much flavor to it. 

The chicken parmesan was good. 

I wouldn't come back again if I had a smaller party and I'll go come again for a LARGE party (larger than 20) because family size makes it easier but it is a little bit pircey for mediocre food.

Note: They added 21% gratuity on our check."}
{"text":"If you are coming here be prepared for two things. 1) You will be completely full after eating here and 2) you will have tons of leftovers. The restaurant is family style or in other words you pick dishes for the table and share. We picked a mixture of pasta, salads, and some smaller side dishes. All of the food was exceptional. My favorite was the friend mozzarella. Overall, I would highly recommend coming here especially with friends."}
{"text":"Went here unknowingly of the portion sizing and never eaten here prior oh my they are very very good and the waiter was great at helping us figure out our portion sizing the food was wonderfull they are very friendly . We definetly will be returning. Oh for desert order the gelato u wont be dissapointed ."}
{"text":"I give this place 5-stars because not because of yummy food, but because of their CHEESECAKE! But I'll get to that later.

THE FIRST VISIT: After skimming through a friends photo album on Facebook, I saw that they ate here and I decided to give it a try! I went on a Wednesday afternoon with my boyfriend for some early lunching! 
I ordered the Linguine Frutti de Mare, its light and hits the spot for pasta and seafood! There are like a gazillion baby clams in that dish I swear.
My boyfriend ordered a ton of stuff but I don't remember... He throughly enjoyed his meal and said it was the best Italian food outside his mother's cooking! (He also mentioned that he'd never eat at Olive Garden after coming here.)

Even after we were pretty much stuffed and ready to be wheeled out by our soft spoken and chipper waitress, we had to try the cheesecake, because I love cheesecake.

It arrived, and the first spoonful of the stuff was heavenly, it was rich and almost heavy, but it just ... Melts in your mouth, that it doesn't matter that you're probably gonna weigh six thousand pounds after the meal. It had roasted hazelnuts and raspberry sauce slathered all over it, oh god, I'm probably going to have to go tomorrow... And order TWO slices of cheesecake. Haha!

My first time here was amazing, our waitress was very attentive and humorous. The second time wasn't so awesome, but I'll cut the waiter that we got some slack because it got really busy really fast compared to the quiet lunch I had the first time. The second time our drinks were empty almost 75% of the time and that's no bueno in my book.

The only reason I will come back is for the cheesecake. I hope that stays consistent."}
{"text":"Looking for a great restaurant on the strip that won't destroy your budget?  This is the place, with their HUGE family style portion sizes you can easily feed 4-6 on a single item.  We ordered the supreme Alfredo and the bowl measured 12\" x 6\" deep and was completely full with great tasting pasta.  

It's easy to find and located inside Excalibur Casino.  Our server was attentive and very friendly, and in addition we were checked on by two managers.  The appetizer was super quick and the main course was brought out as soon as we finished.  The atmosphere is made up of several different Italian themed rooms with pictures covering every inch of the walls.  The only minuses to this location is the lack of a table in the kitchen -if you haven't sat at this \"special\" table in other locations do it!- and the bathrooms are out in the casino.  

As for the pricing, well it's on the strip but still within $5, per item, of their off strip location here in Vegas. Last, I HIGHLY recommend making reservations as the stand by wait was 90 minutes...OUCH!"}
{"text":"Every time we are in Vegas we have grub here. ALWAYS have great service!!!..We sit at the bar area and ALL waiters and waitresses are happy, energetic and just happy to help!"}
{"text":"I knew better than to bring a small party to Buca di Gutbomb, but was overruled and 3 of us had dinner here. With the massive \"family style\" portions these guys serve, 3 is just too small of a party, unless you order carefully (and I'm not sure that's actually possible). We ordered a pepperoni pizza, which was a giant lake of grease and just wasn't very good, a salad that would have fed 5-6 people and was marginal at best, and something else that was forgettable. Tab was huge, service was glacial, the entire experience lousy. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Awful first impression . Management and the server use the line \"I didn't say that\" never coming back awful don't waste a cent here"}
{"text":"The food is extremely over priced because it is setup to be family style.  So if you order a small portion it comes out to serve 3.  Then all the sides are a al cart. So if you order Chicken Parmesan you will have to order a side of pasta if you want a full entree. So going there with just 1 other person is not feasible unless you are wanting to eat the same main entree (of course we did not want the same main entree so I spend for just myself $40). Then you may think well I will take the leftovers home as that is what I thought, however the food did not taste good nor did it agree with me. This is the 2nd time I went there and it was at a friend's request.  When she said she wanted to go there I even responded with, \"really?\" I left there once again saying I would never return just I had the 1st time I had went there.  Others I have gone with say the same.  Don't bother!! If you want a good Italian restaurant go to Bravo."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming to this restaurant and it was very good food.  The service needed to be better as we had to ask for refills and when needing our waiter, we always had to ask the bus person or another server.  Over all, it was a good experience and would dine with them again."}
{"text":"Great place to come for dinner and some family time. If you do come in ask to be seated in Jarretts section! Super friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Each suggestion he made was mouth watering and filling. He definitely envelops the friendly atmosphere and adds to it with his charm and personable character. Will absolutely be back just because of Jarrett."}
{"text":"No matter where I go Buca .... Seattle, Las Vegas, Encinitas... I am always happy. Great family food, always friendly service."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal or bad service at this restaurant.  Ive been here about 60 times over the past 10 years.  Excellent chain.  Excellent management.  Great food.  Great service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was visiting my brother as he was prepping to move from Las Vegas and return to Los Angeles.  Many helpers to feed so I used my groupon for takeout and the food was excellent along with the service.  Thanks for having such an awesome atmosphere.  I love going into the ladies room just to hear the italian lessons."}
{"text":"A large group, on a night of large groups, so waiting for our table was no issue.  It was 30 min later than we were promised,  but the management kept us in the loop. We had pre ordered from their menu for large parties, so no surprises for wait staff.  Food was plentiful and hot, though a lil slow in coming out...45 min between salad and pasta.  They forgot lil things like bread and salt and pepper but we were a large noisy group.  Food was OK. Service OK. But the fact we all sat together and no issues with ordering and all food came out together for whole group (40 people) priceless."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bucca di Beppo.  We shared a Caprese Salad and a Penne San Remo. 

 Given that we have eaten better Italian food in metro Phoenix, I do not rate this place that highly.  For what it is, they are overcharging you.  Spend your money elsewhere on a better Italian food.  You will get better value."}
{"text":"Place was empty and they made us wait 30 mins to be seated.  Ugh... People who walked in after us thought they were being punked."}
{"text":"The food, drinks, and service was amazing. Highly recommend for any group events or if you're in the mood for a lot of food for a good price. Jarrett was an absolutely amazing server who took care of us and made sure we had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Food was good however one waiter by the name of Nick was very rude.  When we asked for water, he replied \"I can only carry 9 at a time!\"  It was as if we burdened him and it was awkwardly obvious he was not trying to help serve us afterwards.  He would repeatedly ignore us and walked by us without acknowledging our presence or he would avoid making eye contact.  We notified management and will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Used to go here all the time but the portions got smaller and the prices larger .. They used to have an amazing salad with meat and cheese loaded with goodies but now it's smaller and all lettuce.. :("}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant on countless occasions. Most of the occasions have been very big like anniversaries, birthdays,  engagement parties, etc. we have never ever had a bad experience at this restaurant. 

The food is always perfect as well as the service being incredibly attentive. The desserts are mind blowing as well as the different menu items. I like the fact that they serve family style--that Way everybody gets a chance to try something new. 

Their service members are just delightful people and they always work at putting you in just the perfect room for your size group and somewhere that you ask to be seated they try their best to get you in that table.  You can even request the table in the restaurant kitchen so that you can see what goes on while they're making your food! Personally, I really like to cook so one day I would love to sit in the kitchen. 

This is always one of my top places to choose when someone asks me where I want to go to eat.  

They have a very nice wine list and I've never had a wine that I wished that I never ordered. The The serving staff is well versed in which wines are paired with the meals that we order and we've never gone wrong by taking their advice.

I love this place, and so does my family, and most anyone that I've ever asked about the restaurant told me they if they had been there, that they absolutely loved it. I wish I could give them more than five stars."}
{"text":"We discovered after eating at the Flamingo/Paradise location, that the prices at this location are 30% higher than their Summerlin location. WEIRD!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't care for chain restaurant but this place is one of the exception.  The pictures of Rome and a typical Italian American life and famous actors/actresses, and politicians are portrayed here.  The portions were very generous..It is NOT the best Italian restaurant that I ever had but it is very good and it will meet expectations of most customers who wanted the American style Italian food.  Since I had many great dining experience in Italy, this is a good introduction.  Service was friendly, efficient, and will do all the upsale pitch but NOT too intrusive (I used to do this also to create big tickets to fatten up my tips as well as pleasing my boss for making more sales as well).  Just decline nicely and they will NOT give you an attitude.."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance! The staff was professional and on top of everything. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes Italian food. The red Sangria is awesome!"}
{"text":"We went out to Bucca on Monday night. While the food was decent the service was horrible. 

First we started out with a male server that seemed to find waiting on us as a burden. Then a female server took over who had no idea about service. OUr drinks sat empty, nobody asked us how the food was and the check literally took over 10 minutes to arrive- even after asking for it. 

I'm not sure I'd ever go back."}
{"text":"One of the worst serving experiences I've had in a while. We made reservations ahead of time and didn't wait long to be seated. After we sat, however, there was no waiter/waitress in sight. We asked one of the adjacent waitresses for our server, and then waited another 10 min, still without drinks, a hello, or any sign of our server. After waiting almost 30 min for a server we left - thirsty, hungry, frustrated, and positive we wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"After receiving a $15 dollars coupon and because of circumstances, I        Decided to make reservation at Bucadi Beppo for Christmas Eve. I kind of hesitated to make them at this location, because the last 2 times we were there they didn't hold up to the standards that the one on Ray Rd  has, but because of convenient I made them there.  NEVER AGAIN!  The reservation was for 3 adults well into or 50's.  They put us at a 30\" square card table with folding chairs next to the service station.  When my husband talked o the manager he said if we weren't happy then we could go back to the reception station and wait another 45 minutes.  In other words too bad.  we sat not 10 minutes and a very young couple was seated at a booth right by us.  The server was great and she kept apologizing to us.  This meal cost us $105.00 not worth it at all.  The sauce on or dinner was so watered down that it had no taste at all.  The food on Ray Road is so much better.  It's hard to believe their the same recipe.  I was so disgusted that I forgot to give them my $15.00 off coupon.  I think that manager should get some customer  service training.  We will not be going back there ever again.  We'll travel the extra 10 miles to Road Road."}
{"text":"This entire updated review is based solely on the poor customer service I have just experience TWICE over the phone with the Westlake store. I've been attempting to place an online order for a family meal deal deluxe. I have added my coupon per the instructions included on my email. I keep getting an error message. I call the store. I ask if they'll apply the discount in person when I pick up. I am told as long as I don't pay online they will. I hang up and continue to check out online... Except! I get an error message that this store requires payment if total is over $75- which means if I pay online they won't honor my 20% off coupon. I call the store back with a solution, I will order over the phone and pay in person and bring my coupon. I get a different person than who I just spoke with and they tell me the \"family meal\" is an online only item and they can't order it. What the heck! They literally just lost a steady customer. Twice on the phone while attempting to provide them BUSINESS they not only don't offer to help but then claim they can't process the order I want. I guess the staff here aren't aware that they wouldn't have jobs without customers and they've just lost my business."}
{"text":"So we decided to have Thanksgiving Italian style. I have been here before, and have enjoyed it. They offered a Thanksgiving dinner including sliced turkey, green beans,  stuffing but we went with Italian flare. 
      Had the mozarella caprese salad, spagetti and chicken parmasean and garlic bread. What I was really craving was a cannoli!! Maybe it was from the recent airing of all three Godfather movies? But lo and behold when I ordered cannolis, I was informed they had ran out!! How can you run out of cannolis!! So I was disappointed!! But at least we got to sit at the table in the kitchen which is smack in the kitchen when you walk through, kind of like a Goodfellas moment!"}
{"text":"I like the family style setting and the serving size was plenty big for my husband and I and at least two more. The pasta was ok, not bad but not great. The bread was good but came with packaged butter. The tiramisu was the biggest let down. It tasted like boxed freezer cake and left a bad taste in my mouth. The service was ok, we got the bread with our dinner but not prior so not something to munch on while your waiting for your food. I would again say it's not bad but not great.For the price of the food and the quality you can find in Vegas I would not recommend this restaurant nor will I be returning."}
{"text":"Spaghetti is delicious, baking surface is good also, very suitable friend for dinner, a nice place!"}
{"text":"I took my mom to this Italian place after we checked in at the Excalibur hotel. We ordered a Caesar salads and an Small Round Square pizza, don't remember the name of it. I had an Italian soda. The waiter was great, the food was great. I am a fan, awesome place."}
{"text":"The manage David gave me a call and apologize. I wasn't expecting for them to care what I think but it was very for the phone call."}
{"text":"Two stars because our waitress was nice.
To start off, I'm a bread fanatic.. Bread was cold and so disappointing I took a bite and said \"meh I'll wait for the main course I guess.\" 
Our $17 pizza was tiny, hard and chewy and honestly just bland. My husband only ate it because he was starving. 
The small $17 spaghetti marinara was ... overpriced obviously. Personally I didn't fancy the sauce and the noodles were too thick and just.. noodles. Wasn't tossed in bloody truffle oil. I've had better cafeteria/catered pasta. 
I literally chose not to eat the entire meal because I have standards. (Do yourself a favor and go to Casanova bros if your craving Italian, half the price twice the flavor, same size/bigger servings.) 
We don't get to go out to eat often and I wish I had saved my $50 bucks, or at least spent it elsewhere."}
{"text":"Average food and not very timely service during lunchtime. I understand they want to serve fresh food, but during lunch, most people are in a little bit of a hurry."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Buca was for dinner, ordering off the family style menu. The food was great and the service was great. We particularly loved the gorgonzola and green apple salad.

This second time we went was for Sunday lunch and the food was disappointing. My side salad was warm and slightly wilted. As for the spaghetti and meatball, the meatball was great, but the spaghetti and its sauce was bland and tasteless. I actually salted my food, something I almost never do in a restaurant. The spaghetti didn't even taste like it had been cooked in salted water.

I'll give them another chance, just in case this was a rare occurrence, but I'd recommend going for dinner, not lunch. The family-style portions served for dinner are a good value and the food was very good."}
{"text":"This is the first Buca di Beppo that I had ever been to. It introduced me to the chain when it opened here in the mid to late nineties. I've always enjoyed the food here..and the ambiance is fun. I've been to many other locations since and have enjoyed most of them, but this one will always hold a special place for me.

My most recent visit here was on a Saturday afternoon for a wake. Not the happiest of circumstances but it still did feel comforting being here. The place as a whole is pretty cozy. There are pictures all over every wall of random Italian related things..they're fun to look at..kind of makes you feel like you're at the comfort of your grandparents house.

There were about 30 people in our group, and we reserved a private room on the third floor. This location has three floors..which is a bit different..it's the only location I've ever been to that has had multiple floors like that. The layout is a bit confusing. I found myself getting lost trying to find the restroom on the second floor. There were different staircases and an elevator..and long narrow hallways to go down. It's a bit confusing for sure but if you keep walking you'll eventually end up where you're supposed to be. 

Our servers that day were awesome. It has to be a bit overwhelming to have to serve a group as big as ours all at once, and to make sure everyone's specific needs are being met, but these servers did an excellent job of keeping everything organized and flowing.

There was Italian bread and dipping oils on the tables when we arrived. The oil they provide is so tasty..and their bread is so fresh and always perfectly made. Next came the salad..with the choice of a house salad or Cesar salad. I'm not a fan of salad but everyone else seemed to be enjoying it.

Buca Di Bepo is known for their \"family style\" portions of food. Meaning basically you order one big dish of a certain menu item and everyone shares it because it's big enough to feed your entire family. 

For this meal they picked three entrees for everyone to choose from: Spaghetti with meat sauce, Cheese Ravioli, and Chicken Parmesan. Lucky for me those are my three favorite things on the menu. 

The Spaghetti was good..and the meat sauce had so much meat in it it tasted like you were eating Spaghetti and Meatballs. The Cheese Ravioli was great..love the cheese blend they stuff them with. The Chicken Parm was the star of the meal..as it normally is. The chicken was tender and the breading was crunchy and salty and perfect. The sauce and cheese on top was tasty and the combination of the chicken, cheese, & sauce practically melts in your mouth. 

The meal ended with a slice of chocolate cake. I'm not a huge fan of cake but this cake tasted really good. The frosting really made it perfect..the cake itself was a bit dry but the frosting really did a lot to moisten it up. 

Great excellent food overall.

The only downside to the meal was that the food took a pretty long time to come out. We arrived at 2pm and didn't leave until almost 4. I don't really blame the servers for this though. It was a wake that we were at and I'm sure they wanted to give enough time for everyone to get settled, and have time to talk and relax and stuff. It probably wouldn't have been noticeable had we not been so hungry. I probably ended up eating 3 loaves of bread myself waiting for the food to come.

Overall, I highly recommend Buca Di Bepo. I've always had great experiences when coming here. The food is great..as is the atmosphere and the service. They are good at handling big groups, and from what I hear, prices are pretty reasonable for as much as you get. It's just a win-win-win all around."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming to this location. I used to go to Buca a lot in California and always loved it here. The reason I am deciding to give it 4 stars is because I felt a certain way about the cleanliness of the restaurant seating/bathroom. They sat us in a booth off to the side, which was nice for privacy, but when I turned around to look at the pictures, I noticed all around the top of the booth was a lot of dust, and it had straw wrappers sitting there. It wasn't just a small amount of dust either, so you can tell it hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The food was really good and my family enjoyed it, but when we were heading out my kids had to use the restroom. Once we opened the door we had to watch our step because there was a \"caution when wet\" sign that had fallen over and was just laying there. Anyone not paying attention could have tripped and hurt themselves. About 2 minutes of being in the bathroom a worker came in to use the restroom. Although she saw the sign she didn't bother to pick it up. Again I love this place. Just need to be dusted more often."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We had a family get together here and it was great. If you have a large family and you're looking for a place to go this is the place. Amazing food and great service. We had thirteen people and our waiter did a great job. The food was on point. The eggplant parmigiana and chicken saltimbocca  were great."}
{"text":"Inflated strip prices.  Bad service, slow service and the place was empty. Wouldn't take a mobile coupon,  and we paid 8 dollars for about a half serving of pasta to go with our chicken parm. As LV locals we know better than to eat on the strip,  but went with Buca because it's a known quantity.  Wrong. The strip location is 25% more for 50% less food snd a bad attitude.  Never again."}
{"text":"Well they made us wait several minutes with no host, finally host shows up and says they are only taking reservations because they booked a bunch of banquets. Seems to me that they would prefer to turn down a reservation than turn away customers at the door, I mean, it's Buca di Beppo. Who would expect to need a reservation? And if that's the case, have someone ready to tell me, don't wait 5-10 minutes. Put a sign on the door. Such a ridiculous business practice."}
{"text":"We used to love visiting buca quite often.  The sauce and meat has its own flavor that I just can't copy at home.  Each time we have gone in the last year or so it seems to be going downhill.  Upon getting there and sitting down as i was scooting my chair in, i stuck my hand in gum, went to the bathroom to wash my hand and it smelled of mildew, but its a bathroom so maybe it wasnt?  :/  Previously we got small plates for bread and large plates for dinner, so when dinner came we stacked up our plates and the server saw us but never brought new plates so we had to unstack and use the small plates to eat on.  Our spaghetti had meat but not really any sauce.  It tasted like a bowl of plain noodles, I was extremely disappointed.  We also had ordered a large lasagna and the server, Dale, told us all that was left was a piece that was 3/4 the size of the large that he could give us and charge us for a small or wait 45 minutes.  We said ok but we're very disappointed in the piece we got.  It was really about 3/4 the size of the small, maybe he thought we had never been there but I was pretty upset.  We ate most of it and my youngest slept through dinner.  Luckily we also had pizza for.him because there was not enough left to feed him because of their lack of preparedness at 440 just before dinner rolled around.   Dale was nice but the food was the main issue this time.  We probably won't be back for a long while."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last weekend after first visiting their Chandler establishment a few years back with a few of my friends and boy am I satisfied!

We got to Bucca di Beppo just shy of 8pm on Saturday night and only had to wait around for 10mins.  So while we stood around outside enjoying the cool autumn air, we browsed their menu and had everything pretty much figured out.  After we were called back into the restaurant and walked up the staircase and into Alaska [it was really really cold in the restaurant!], everybody crooned over all their interesting framed artwork.  But let's not get into that.  Let's talk food!

So the four of us ordered:  

Stuffed Mushrooms - The pesto sauce was absolutely delicious but the mushrooms itself were pretty standard and were super tiny.

A small Baked Ziti - Warm and filling but nothing mind-blowing.

A small Macaroni Rosa - My personal favorite.  The vegetables really adds a bunch of flavor it needed

A small Shrimp Florentine - My least favorite.  The garlic butter sauce was bland but add a little salt and pepper and mix like crazy and it becomes a decent dish.

So while my memories of the first time being at the restaurant in the east valley had been full of sparkles and good memories, my second visit to the chain was slightly disappointing.  Perhaps the chef just has a light hand when it comes to seasoning but nothing was overly spectacular.  It's still a good place to go to hang out with friends and the price isn't too bad [The bill came out to $20-25 per person]."}
{"text":"We loved it! Four of us dined and we all thought the food was delicious! The meals are \"family style\" and feed either 2-3(small) or 4-5 (large). We ordered the small salad (and there was some left over after all 4 of us ate some) Then, we shared a large shrimp Florentine that was delicious. Not much left here bc we all went back for seconds! Crusty bread with balsamic/oil for dipping was served. Had a glass of wine with dinner that paired nicely. 
The waitress was a sweetheart and took good care of us. We will definitely return if we are ever back in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Myself, my husband, and 11 month old daughter ate here for Christmas. We could not have asked for better service. We were invited to sit in the kitchen, and treated like family. We had a phenomenal experience, it made this Christmas the best we've had as a couple so far! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is the third year in a row we have come for Thanksgiving. This is also the third year in a row we have had to wait EVEN THOUGH we had reservations. We will go elsewhere next year. 

The food is okay but the fact that we have reservations but don't get seated at the reserved time is ridiculous. Three years in a row. Nope. Not again."}
{"text":"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.


It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.

When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.

Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something."}
{"text":"Friendly servers and great food served as family-style. Delicious! Perfect for family and friends. The place is much larger than it looks like from the street. Parking is available in a pay-per-hour garage."}
{"text":"So I have only been to Buca Di Beppo about 3 times: once for prom in high school, once last year for my sister's birthday, and once two days ago. 
Now, knowing that I am Deaf and restaurants tend to be very difficult for me to hear in, my friend and I requested a table that was in a more quiet section. Our hostess seated us at a booth in the bar, and it was actually really nice. The music wasn't super loud, and we were actually able to hear each other. The decor is very eclectic, with everything kind of everywhere, but it works. The only negative I could say is that we waited for about 10 minutes before anyone came over to get our drink order, and the table was slightly sticky. 
Our server was really nice and very knowledgeable about the wines and what each entree came with. We ended up getting the artichoke spinach dip, cheese manicotti, and baked ziti. She also got a pizza to take home to her husband. Our actual server was less than impressive, only coming by once or twice. However, the bartender was more attentive, making sure we had plenty of refills and bread. 
The prices are higher, each plate costing around $20. However, the portions are monstrous, and served as \"family style\", so you get plenty for your money (two days later and I STILL have left over baked ziti).
The highlight of our meal was the double dark chocolate cake... holy moly... absolutely delicious. 
All in all, I would recommend this location. It is a super fun, relaxed environment and the food is really good."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, unique decor 
. it was so great we went back the next night. They serve family style. We had a Greek salad and manicotti with fresh made sauce. They offered our friend a gluten free menu."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Sometimes great, sometimes good. We get the Caprese appetizer and the prosciutto chicken most of the time. 
Their decorations could use some dusting, saw a lot of dust especially between the big gallon wine bottles. Pretty scary amounts actually. I hope they're more tidy in the kitchen. The servers are usually attentive and very friendly, sometimes they don't visit the back corners as often though. 
Also some of the cushions need new springs or should be replaced as they sink in a lot in some places. We had to be reseated multiple times because of it and we both way under 150lb. 
We come back as we like the food and it's the closest thing to an affordable Italian meal. I do hope the dust issues is addressed though."}
{"text":"way to over priced. plus the food made me sick. no bueno"}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few times in the past.
This night we went in just the 2 of us.
When we were seated I think Dinner hours just started not too many people here yet but while we sat there more came in but service was slow.

We ordered the Speghetti with meat sauce family style,
You do get a lot and we ended up taking a lot home I think because we filled up on bread.
We ordered the cheesy bread and we got 4 pieces under the appetizers for $13.99!!!
It was the Cheesy Bread Florentine
Parmesan, mozzarella, provolone, spinach, Roma tomatoes, garlic and Alfredo sauce melted on top of our house-baked Italian bread.
If you go to the web page or the menu and look at this bread it has tomatoes!!! Check my picture out it had a couple of small pieces scattered over all 4 pieces. This is a JOKE!! We were going to say something but my husband was mad and said forget it , it will be our last time going here.
The regular bread came out first and we were pretty hungry ate that and while we waited for our dinner which seemed to be taking forever we ordered the appetizer of cheese bread.
The Spaghetti finally came out after we had ate our regular bread and the appetizer
and we were by then getting full on Bread!
So the picture shows how much Spaghetti we ended up going home with,
Over all I think were better off going to a  authentic Italian restaurant with a good reputation than going to a chain restaurant.
The service this night here was not too good. The server seemed to disappear for awhile before we seen her again.
We left not too happy spending what we did and not getting our moneys worth,"}
{"text":"We have gone to dinner here a few times over the years.

We started with our Son ordering some sangria which was really good.

My husband loves Italian food and if he had his way would eat it everyday,
Our son took us to dinner a couple of different times (Photos show both times) 

He ordered the Family Style Lasagna and the other was for the Spaghetti with meat sauce and he added Shrimp.


The service is always really good , There are still better Italian restaurants but for a chain this food isn't that bad and the prices are not too bad either.

We never have any left overs because my husband and son are big eaters and they eat whatever is left.

We enjoyed our visits every time we have been here. No complaints"}
{"text":"This place is ok. My husband and I came here on an afternoon only about two workers, very slow. My food was alright. I would rather go to Olive Garden though. Not bad but not my favorite."}
{"text":"I lived 15 years of adult life with entering a Buca De Beppos - why didn't I keep the streak going? 

The best thing I can say is that the food is OK - that's why they get 2 stars. Nothing our table ordered (Apple Gorgonzola salad, stuffed mushrooms, baked ziti, garlic bread, Chicken Salta-something) was a standout dish, but it also wasn't bad enough to send back - lacked seasoning, but was technically what was described in the menu. 

I don't mind the charm of a dingy, family run restaurant. But trying to infuse that charm into a corporate restaurant? It borders on creepy with too much nude art, barfy carpet, dusty wine bottles, and even a bust of the pope. An aura of old and filthy was what they were going for? It's hard not to see the pope's dead eyes as judging you as a glutton when there's red sauce on your chin.

The service was good, but our table was too small, and with the family style we straight ran out of space. Weird problem. Couldn't wait to leave. Didn't take pictures of the food. Wasn't sad when my leftovers got left at my in-laws. Buca De no thanks."}
{"text":"Went with a group of people since it's family style and we thought it would be fun. Reservations were easy to make online, and the waitress was decent. 

None of us were expecting amazing Italian food since it's a chain, but we at least expected decent tasting food. 

The salad and the fresh bread were good, and the pizza wasn't bad. But the pasta was bland as bland can be, and the sauce was watery. It was so thin it looked like broth with a few chunks of tomato. The meatballs were large, but again, bland. The stuffed chicken was dry and was supposed to come on top of a pesto sauce which actually turned out to be more of an alfredo.

Nobody, and I mean nobody, in our large party was impressed. When the bill came we were even less impressed. It was so overpriced for the quality that we all walked out disgusted. By the time we all got back to our friends house half the group was running to the bathroom. Somehow, this bland food managed to tear up their stomachs, and that led to some, um, explosive situations. Thankfully, I was spared that part.

Skip this joint, not worth it!"}
{"text":"I went for a late lunch because Buca sent me an email coupon for a free small pasta dish. I was hungry and had an hour to spare so I stopped in. The service was very friendly, and a server came to take my order very quickly. She was knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful in the ordering process. What threw me off was when she indicated that my order should only take about 5 minutes (for baked ziti). About 20 minutes later when I was able to get her attention (she was working alone and several tables had filled up) she indicated that she would bring my food right out. What I anticipated as a small plate of baked ziti was enough to feed a family. I ate what I could, but took home two take-out containers full of pasta. Summary, portion sizes are huge, service is friendly, but slow when they get busy. Food was just ok."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to corporate joints but a friend had a coupon so hey...why the hell not? There were 3 of us on a busy night and we had no reservations so we sat at the bar and waited for our table. The hostess taking names could've been a little more friendly or perhaps crack a smile but whatever, I wasn't here to make friends. The bartender was kinda bizarre. We thought we'd try a new dip on the menu but he quickly talked us out of it,saying that no-one ever finishes it. So we just didn't get anything because nothing else looked good. Then the same thing with a drink my friend ordered, he said not to try it. That nobody likes it. He did however make a suggestion for another drink that's more popular. We were seated in a room that was fairly warm. Not sure if they had the heat on 80 or what, but it was pretty hot in there. We had a ceaser salad, spaghetti and meatballs and garlic bread. All delicious. Its family style so 1 large dish is plenty for 3-4 people. Nicole was our server and was awesome. Everything came out in a timely manner and she was super friendly even though they were crazy busy. The manager came by so that was great,too. So, usually we would've done dessert but it was just too much food and the desserts are huge too. I don't know that I'll come back but I wouldn't be opposed to it."}

GET IN MY BELLY!

Well, I have a new one after eating at Buca Di Beppo. 
MY BELLY HURTS!

The good:
+Love the family-style ordering. Sharing plates and trying different things is always fun. It gives you something to talk about and you're engaging with the people at your table. 
+ The portions are HUGE. C'mon, a 1/2 pound meatball???!! Whoa.
+ Service was pretty good; I was surprised.
+ The interior is just so weird, it's cool. Random pictures that will definitely jump-start conversations.

And the bad?
 - Barely anything healthy on the menu. No, a Ceaser's Salad doesn't count! 
 - A meager, at best, alcohol menu. Their House Cab was decent. 
 - It's a chain restaurant that really likes their fake flowers. 
- Did I mention how my belly hurt afterwards?

I didn't even eat that much. I ordered a salad, which was pretty great, I admit. I sampled their stuffed shells, lemon-butter baked chicken and that huge meatball. It was all pretty good. I liked the salad the best. 

Having picked and nibbled, I didn't think my stomach would get upset. Boy, I was wrong. Not a few hours later and it feels like both a harpooned and beached whale, bloated and miserable. 

The highlight of the experience was a table next to us, talking about my fave cheese in the world, Gouda. They were Dutch, with accents. I felt like I was among family, with those wonderful Gouda-loving strangers and the own wonderful people at my table. 

So, in summary:
+ Loved the concept. 
- Hated the bellyache."}
{"text":"We are from LA area and spent Mother's Day weekend in Vegas. We had our Mother's Day lunch at this location. I would like to commend our server Sean for a job well done! He was very friendly, courteous and very diligent in providing the best customer service. He was evening juggling between serving and bartending. His coworkers are great team players too and helped out. Awesome team players! Thank you do much! I hope upper management sees this and give some kind of a bonus or even a raise to Sean for job well done and providing friendly,  excellent customer service! Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Good thing the food at this place is good, because the service and the management are horrible. The waiter was rude, kept messing up our order, and didn't know how to use our MLife points. The manager was rude and didn't know how to use comps either. Very disappointed in the whole experience. I'd go back to a different location for the food, but stay away from the one at Excalibur."}
{"text":"We dine here by default when the family meets in LV.

The famous Buca di Beppo  \"chef's table in the kitchen\"  isn't allowed in Clark County, so it's sort of a table next to the kitchen with a big window looking in.

Food is bland, tasteless, and everything costs extra. Read that: Everything. Extra sauce, extra pasta, refill on the bread will cost you more so hold that thought.
 Service is OK, big portions and big prices and they do run out of menu items.

If you have one of those big families where ya wanna pass the baby(s) around the table, and the kids can get a little louder than normal and do pre-dinner table top activities like coloring and such,,, you can talk at above normal levels which is standard for any Italian family,, make some noise,, it's OK here.

Wish they'd improve the flavor of the menu. Probably comes frozen to the location from the company and is warmed and served. It ain't fresh cooked, you can count on that.

I dunno,,, like I said, we eat here by default and it has it's place for families and groups,, but if it was just the wife and I we'd go some place else and get much better for the money."}
{"text":"We only went because we had a gift card.....Will never go back.  While waiting for a table, the people in front of us had asked for a booth.  They were told by the hostess that she was not going to clean off a booth just for them.  they walked out and we should have followed.  We were seated at a table, and there were tables around us that had dirty dishes on them.  They were not cleaned off the whole time we were there.  Ordered a salad.  It was iceberg and tomatoes for $15 dollars.   The garlic bread had a few pieces that seemed to have had something spilled on them.  We ordered chicken, which was just OK.  Don't waste your time at this place.  It is not run well, dirty, and food wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Eh! It's real big inside but the way it's set up you can totally get confused trying to get out. We had a large party so we were placed in a round room. It was nice but WAY OVER DONE on the decor. I don't think they've heard of \"less is better\". The center of the table had a creepy statue of the pope. 
Food wasn't too amazing in my opinion and I'll head over to Nora's for Italian food. The chicken we got was bland and they probably assumed the lemon sauce would do all the seasoning or something. The Alfredo was just ok, again bland and not enough sauce. Wished it was more rich and creamy. I didn't try anyone else's dishes but I didn't hear anyone say that they were good nor bad. I know none of us walked out saying how amazing it was and we'll have to come back. That's because we probably won't. Service is the only reason they get two stars. Our guy handled our party well and kept us happy on refills and bread. He was professional and upbeat!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Service. I had a Luxor $25 credit voucher I used, a $10 off coupon & also a FREE birthday brownie. The guys at Buca let me use ALL deals, which lead me to a GREAT bill. Happy Birthday to me! hehe! Food was amazing as usual, since I love Buca in general. Also, our watier was a cool guy. 

This location has a cute setting. Also, it doesn't get too crowded. I guess I'm just so used to having Buca so crowded at the SF location,  also the most busiest & closest Buca to me.

I  would def recommend the Vegas location to go to. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. We just waited ten minutes for a Maitre'D to show up. When she finally decided to slowly walk to the front, she informed us that there would be a ten to fifteen minute wait. 

(Hate to tell you, but I peeked and you probably had about fifteen open tables. You couldn't even let us sit to get drinks while you found a waiter?!)"}
{"text":"I love anything Italian. I got the penne with vodka sauce. Yummy. I'm now addicted. I will be back to try other items which I'm sure will be just as good."}
{"text":"How could anyone not love Buca It is our all-time favorite place.  Price is reasonable, food spectacular, service has always been excellent.  I could go once a week.  I even went and bought a bag full and took it on the plane to Groton CT"}
{"text":"I call early to find out the pizza sizes whoever answer the phone had no idea the only thing they say FEW TIMES it  feeds 2 or tree persons 
And I ask again finally I got an answer 3feet by 3 feet  a $20 cheese pizza I may be ok with that 
But went arrive today same it feeds 2 to 3 people....the server btw the only good part of the experience... went to get the board  for me to have and idea it was really small like a 13 inches and it was just below average I bit burn but I ask for crispy it was hot ok. And I was hungry lol
The bread was good to 
Ohh $25 for a pitche is beer this is worst than yard house lol
NOP I DONT THING SO 
BYE FOR GOOD BUCA..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give better stars, the host and staff at the front were very nice when my husband and I came in for our pickup order.

We got home and were so disappointed with the spaghetti & meatballs we ordered. The sauce was so watery and gross... The meatballs had no taste. You know it's bad when your husband says that the meat balls he had on deployment in Afghanistan last year were much better. Not sure if it was cause the cooks had to work on Labor Day or what the deal was but it was a waste of money for sure. I've always loved this restaurant but I'm from California and I guess I just expected the same food quality here.

We don't plan on coming back and instead will just make our own pasta at home."}
{"text":"Came to this location four nights ago. It was pretty late and near closing time (which we were unaware of until arriving) we came in and the three employees working in the front looked at us as if we were breaking the law by coming in. They all walked around doing busy work and even continued taking phone calls. At no point did ANY employee acknowledge our presence! After standing there as if we were invisible we left. Understanding that it was late, we decided to give them another shot four days later. It was pretty slow and not many patrons. We were a party of six were seated in a cramped area next to another 6 person party with very little room for anyone to even sit. Once seated, three wait staff persons tended to the only other two parties in the upstairs area and it took approximately 20 minutes for anyone to come to our table. Eventually our salad was brought out which sat because there were no plates on the table. Not sure how much worse this experience will be as it is still on going! This will be my last visit to this location and I would caution against others from doing the same.  Poor management, poor leadership, poor customer service!!

As expected it got worse! Plates finally arrived and four of them were dirty! Not a little dirty but with old food on them!  And usually you receive bread at the table to start of with but this is not a normal place now is it! Went from bad to worse. And did I mention that the table we are sitting at is an outdoor picnic table which isn't the worst thing but the tablecloth didn't even cover the entire plastic fold up table....REALLY?!!!"}
{"text":"If you're loud, Italian and proud, you will love this place. If not, I would probably stick to a place like Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden. Food is served family style...of course! How else is Italian food ever served?? The food is good, the prices, well, you get what you pay for and you're paying to feed a family. Love it!"}
{"text":"I love this resturant! Family style servings and food is the best! The lasaunga is my FAV!"}
{"text":"2 stars for the friendly staff and decent service.. 0 stars for the food and the pricing. 

A typical trip to Buca  includes a 200 dollar bill for what they call \"Family style plates\" when in actuality it's just double a typical olive garden portion. This might be acceptable if the quality was above Olive Garden but the disappointing thing is its not.. if anything it's lower quality. You're better off going to Olive Garden or if you want a step up from that try Cucina Tagliani!"}
{"text":"This place is a complete waste of time and money. The service was poor, the food was sub par, and the ambiance was terrible. The seats in our booth were in desperate need of repair, the waiter completely forgot we had mentioned it was my birthday, and the bathroom was disgusting. The bread was served cold and wasn't very flavorful, and both entrees we ordered were incredibly bland. I've been to other locations and was really pleased, but I'd advise fellow yelpers to avoid this location."}
{"text":"We reserved a room for our work event. It was very easy to reserve and we had great service. Our whole staff and everyone we invited had a great time and enjoyed themselves. The only thing I would say is that they are a little inconsistent on their alcoholic drinks. Also, it would be great if they had more variety. With that being said, I would definitely revisit this restraunt. We ordered the appetizer combo, and pizza, and salad. All the food was great and there are big portion sizes!"}
{"text":"$10 coupon and FREE spaghetti coupon brought me back here recently, and things haven't changed.  This is some of the most ordinary Italian fare that I've ever had and they give you huge portions that you cannot avoid.  Well, you can, but it is silly when you consider the price difference between the full size order and the half order.

Eggplant isn't bad, and I'm upset that they axed a few appetizer menu options from the menu.  It's cool that they have an Italian beer on tap but they need more beer options.  Not all of us splurge on restaurant wine, especially if you're trying to lure customers via coupons."}
{"text":"No people of color on the wall.
The food is good american Italian food. Nice salad options, good pasta and sauce, well cooked meats. The service is good. The portions are very large and it's a great place for groups. This restaurant is HUGE. The decor includes over 5000 pictures of white people. No people of color on the walls however you can see some celebrities on the \"Wall of fame\" in the lobby. Noticing this fact made me very uncomfortalbe. I wont be back."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was absolutely awesome.  The manicotti was absolutely delicious.  The appetizer of stuffed mushrooms were really good.  Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"There are thousands of trinkets embedded into the walls and ceiling of this place. I could spend hours in here. The food was rich and decadent. I was seated right next to the kitchen, and heard the clanking of plates throughout my meal."}
{"text":"Two experiences both good.

The first was a Party pan-to-go event after my daughter's wedding while many people were still in town.   The meal was hosted by the in-laws and everyone enjoyed the cheese bread, penne ala vodka and my favorite penne arrabbita.  

Fast forward several months....  looking for a place to pick up dinner and thought of Buca.  Only the two of us but Italian holds for left-overs better than almost any other cuisine.  Same daughter....both loved the Arrabbita previously so that's what we ordered along with a small Chopped Antipasto Salad.

The portion of 2+ is an understatement, if you're not gluttonous it probably feeds 4 easily.  The zesty sauce was as good as I remembered and plenty of sausage.  They also do not skimp on the sauce which is key if you plan on reheating it another day as we did.    

The Antipasto Salad was excellent and HUGE.  This very large salad was choked with various cheeses, vegetables and lots of pepperoni.  At home I was thinking what a $9 salad looks like at other establishments and this salad is more than double or perhaps triple the size.  Great value, lots of goodies and for that alone I'll return.

I have no personal experience for eating in the restaurant but get that if you're not keen on sharing someone else's choice it could be a drag.  The pricing for two may seem high but not really as you've got food for days.  UNLESS I can't kill the salad before it turns brown and needs tossed.  

Food was good and absolutely would recommend for a big outing, large group or party.  I see good value in their shared portions.  YMMV.

Oh, side note - Terrific service at the front.  Order was taken quickly, offered a drink while I waited, offered to help me out to my car, held the door, thanked me, etc etc.  Very plesant staff at Chandler!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was delicious and our server Alyssa was the best. Not a single complaint. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I had written a bad review about the this place not long ago and they were happy to give me another shot at eating at the place and paying for my meal. I'm glad they were willing to allow me to have another chance at it.
However, though it wasn't as bad as last time I ate here they food hasn't much improved. I ordered the same meal, the Buca Trio Platter. I was a little hesitant to order the same thing that made me sick before but they were assuring me it was going to be good.

I the mozzarella triangles aren't bad for frozen food. The stuffed mushrooms weren't as wet as last time but this time my biggest issue was the calamari. Last time I ate it, it made me sick, and had food poisoning. This time around, wasn't much better. It didn't make me sick but half of it was cold and the other half was hot. This tells me that they were cooked at different times.

I'm sorry to staff at Bucca but I still give it one star as the food was not good and the chefs must not care about the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Decent Italian food for large groups of people and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Buca di Beppo is my favorite chain Italian Restaurant.  I am not a big fan of chains, but there is something about Buca di Beppo that makes me come back for more.  Typically, you want to go with a big group because the portion sizes are huge.  Buca di Beppo has done a good job creating smaller entrees for even a serving size of 2 people.

My favorite dish is the eggplant parmigiana, but they had a recent scare of Salmonella in the Eggplants.  I wish I knew this earlier because I was really excited for it.  This is why I am not giving my experience a 5 star, lol.  

We ended up getting a lemon chicken dish, baked ziti, and green beans.  The lemon chicken had a light butter, olive oil, and capers.  It went well with the green beans that was cooked in olive oil.  The baked ziti is a new item, and we got it for free because March was a trial run to see how people liked the item.  The baked ziti kind of made up for the lack of the eggplant dish I crave for.

I am surprised by the lower ratings for this restaurant, but it may be due to the several Italian options in Scottsdale and Mesa."}
{"text":"Love the food here.
Everything comes in a large portion to share.
I came for lunch and I had to share that because it seemed like a dinner portion. Prices are pretty good and affordable (check it happy hour and lunch time menu) 
They even ask if you'd like your picture taken. And if you agree they present the pictures to you in a fancy frame (to entice you to buy) but if you decline to buy they give you two free small pictures! 
Staff very friendly!"}
{"text":"We went with a group last night and expectations were high as my fiancé has been there before. The food was excellent and the service was OK and the food took a long time to get out. My main grumble is the amount of food for the price is not worth it! If you're spending $21 and family sale for three it should feed more than one and a half. Very expensive for what you get!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!!! No questions about it. The food, the service, the happy hour. It's ALL good."}
{"text":"The business has a small Lg. Chopped Antipasto Salad and it's not chopped very well. The one in Scottsdale makes a huge and  awesome Lg. Chopped Antipasto Salad. Put some muscle into it peeps!"}
{"text":"The chicken Marsala I had at lunch was subpar. It was a big portion but the side of fettuccini ran into the chicken and made one big mess. The marsala sauce was too sweet also. Maybe some would enjoy mixing it all together, but the fettuccini alone is better without the marsala sauce mixed in. I did like the cheap side salad you can add to any lunch entrée, my Caesar side was vey good."}
{"text":"Food is good hence the two stars. It's not bad for an Italian place considering there's not many decent places here in Vegas. I ordered a small chicken carbonara to go and it was enough to bring to a potluck. The pasta was not dry and it was very flavorful. The bits of bacon gave it more taste.

What concerned me the most is their customer service. There was NO customer service in this restaurant at all. The host was busy talking with who seems to be the manager and they didn't even acknowledge my presence when I was right in front of them. I also received no help when I was at the take out counter. I was standing there unattended for a good 5-10 minutes before someone even asked me if I was being helped, even though so many servers came and passed by me (they were even making eye contact with me).

Their online ordering system also needs more improvement. I ordered online and received my confirmation email, so I thought it was all good. When someone finally helped me, they told me that they cancelled my order because my payment didn't go through. All this time I was unaware that they cancelled it without notification so I had to wait at the restaurant even more so they could prepare my order. The person I was talking to seemed to blame me because of my cancelled payment (even though I used the same card I put in online) and was not apologetic for the inconvenience.

Overall it was such a disappointing visit. I wouldn't mind eating at Buca di Beppo but I will definitely go to another location."}
{"text":"Michael J took great care of us. Super positive and full energy. I will definitely come back to this location.  Thanks Michael J :)"}
{"text":"Have had 3 great meal here. Super food, Great service.
Great value for the money. Always left with a doggy bag. Sorry but dog didn't get it."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant numerous times and can honestly say that this is the best I can give them. Usually if you walk in when they are first opening up...it is a ghost town and I have literally had to walk around looking for an employee to seat us. Again I only come here because my children love this place otherwise I would skip the Buca experience completely. The prices continue to increase and the portions luckily are very decent. My biggest complaint is being seated and served in a timely manner. The food is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Herd the hype but it did not live up to it. Coming from an Italian the biggest complaint I have is DRY pasta which is what we got. There was not taste, not enough sauce and for the price it is over rated. The bowl was to feed 4 yet you get 3 sausage's, HUH! The salad was good but the main dish was a bust.

Were they having an off day maybe but will I return more than likely no. Maybe the other locations are better?"}
{"text":"Our family made a reservation and drove an hour to be here. They claimed the systems were down and stood waiting for an hour and a half. As many tables were empty and people who came after were seated before us. Tried to pass the time at the bar which computers were working fine..and we're ignored for another hour. After finally being seated after numerous statements saying our party was next received horrible service and we're hardly acknowledged. If it weren't for the time we already invested we would have left and burned the place down... throughout all of this we still continued to be polite and tip well. This was the worst experienced I've had in so long!"}
{"text":"It has been way too long Buca... And you were so damn delicious last night. Service was exceptional except for the bread that never came. No matter though. The bruschetta was freshly chopped tomatoes, garlic, and peppers on golden toasts. Love the presentation too. The fried appie plate was flavorful bits of calamari, mozzarella, and cheesy mushrooms. We shared the frutti del mar spiced delicately and filled with shrimp, mussels, and squid. The chicken pram was heavenly as was the baked ziti. No dessert tonight for us... Too full!!  I will be back Buca and it won't be a three year wait."}
{"text":"Alright, Buca earns a solid 4 STARS. The Family dinning option is great. The environment is superb. This is NOT your typical Italian restaurant where they want you in and out. They want you to stay as long as you want! Family Style all around.

The Good.- all the pasta is made in-house! The pasta is delicious, the sauces are full flavor and The portions are huge! With a large serving at least 6 people can eat and be fully satisfied! 

The Great.- if you are having a birthday, this is the spot to celebrate it! They bring you a huge candle, everyone comes and sings to you. They make you feel special! Like your family would! 

The Best.- kudos to the staff, everyone is very friendly and They keep checking on you. They even give you a free picture, and of course they try to sell you an additional one, but it's a great deal! And guess what! Its a business, that's what business do.

Overall.- portions are huge, staff is very friendly, food is good. Come hungry, make sure that you do not order too much food and you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"The quality of food at Buca di Beppo has really gone downhill. I was here for dinner a couple nights ago and I didn't enjoy the food at all. My minestrone soup had no broth or flavor. It tasted as though it was a can of crushed tomatoes combined with a drained can of green beans. And that's it. My husband's Caesar salad was not fresh. The chicken rigatoni came with a nice spicy tomato sauce which the chef inexplicably decided to ruin by dumping a bag of frozen peas into it.

The decor was tacky to begin with and now its just looking tired and dusty. I think the only people who come here are large families or groups wanting to take advantage of the humongous portion sizes. There were no less than three tables with toddlers whose parents thought it was ok to let them scream their head off and/or run around the restaurant while they sat at the table with a glass of wine talking to their friends. Which reminds me, their Chianti is terrible. I see no reason to return."}
{"text":"We walked into the lobby and nobody greeted us for about four minutes.  Finally someone came and led us through the kitchen and then into another part of the dining room and sat us down.  The kitchen was filthy.  There was grease on the floor so when every customer walked through there....they dragged the grease on their shoes with them.  Why any restaurant would elect to walk customers through part of a filthy kitchen is beyond me.  We waited 65 minutes for our food from the time we sat down.  We ordered the Chicken Limone and some pasta.  They brought out the chicken without the pasta and we waited another 12 minutes for the pasta.  That would be like going to Lone Star Steak House and they brought only the mashed potato's and then said ....the steak will be out in 10-15 minutes.  The manager was apologizing to the table next to me as we were coming in....little did I know he'd be apologizing to us by the time we were leaving.  I had possibly the worst restaurant experience in my life.  Management tried to use the excuse that they had a coupon expiring that night and they were caught off guard....but that is still no excuse for dragging your customers through a grease filled kitchen and then making them wait 65 minutes to eat....and then serve them their food in intervals of 15 minutes.  Please don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"Ok, the food is very good, excellent flavors for homestyle Italian, BUT.... I'm not exaggerating when I say that it takes literally forever... to get your food. Took an hour to even order food. I know it is a Friday night, and we are a party of 8 ( 5 kids),but I am visiting from out of state, and I can't believe how different this is from the ones I've eaten at in Texas. We've been here for 2 1/2 hours. We're still waiting for dessert, and if it wasn't my niece's birthday we would have been out of here. 
Frustrated with a bunch of very patient kids."}
{"text":"I had a not so positive experience, however, the management contacted me and was very willing to make everything right. Will give them another try."}
{"text":"While the staff is friendly and amiable, the food is below par and service slow. 

Seven of us went on a slow week night (Game 2 of Indians/Cubs World Series). It was my daughter's birthday so had to give up the first few innings for her. 

Our server was attentive and friendly. The salad was soggy with way too much dressing. Lasagna was just plain bad. Noodles were overcooked to the point of mush. The chicken lemon was the best dish we had and was actually pretty darn good. 

It seemed to take forever between the salad and entree. 

I have been to Buca in the past but it seems to have gone down hill to the point where I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"First time there. It was alright. Family style Italian looking food just didn't have the bold flavors and quality ingredients I was expecting. The Balsamic vinegar for the bread dip was garbage. Just another average Italian chain restaurant but with a family style hook."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town! Food was absolutely amazing, the atmosphere was very welcoming, and our waiter Josh was fantastic. Definitely recommend for out-of-towners and locals!"}
{"text":"Over priced even for Vegas. I got spicy backed sausage which was dry could use more sauce. The sausage was not even spice despite the name.  I do not plan to come back to this chain ever again.  There meals are not hard to make so if I want them again I will make it myself."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and food! Went for a birthday celebration and they made it so special! Definitely would recommend this place for celebrations and date nights! I can't wait till I'm back in Charlotte so I can visit! Special shoutout to Norry the manager, he really made sure we had an incredible experience! Thank you all again for a great night!"}
{"text":"Buca is my absolute favorite chain Italian restaurant! 

Everything is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Always pleased with food. Portions great for family size..only thing I wish they could have is more crafted beer"}
{"text":"Go here every year for my Birthday. Probably my favorite restaurant anywhere in the valley. Love their Bruschetta!!!!!!!! Best kind of Bruschetta I've tasted at any Italian Restaurant I've been to! So Delicious."}
{"text":"Another late night Vegas dinner, we made reservations for 9:30pm, showed up on time and still had to wait for a table.  Big pet peeve of mine.

Our server was fairly snappy about their portion sizes when we both ordered separate entrees.  She over-emphasized it was for sharing.  Yes... we know.. you said it multiple times.   Our plan was to eat some of our entree and have it as lunch and leftovers during our road trip.

The portions were ginormous, and we were warned, we planned for 2 day lunch leftovers but it was good for 3 days.

I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, it was delicious.  Giant meatballs made properly Italian (half pork/half beef).   Despite the small annoyances, I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Bucca Di Beppo never fails to provide good  friendly service, food at fair prices, and an atmosphere unlike anything else anywhere you go.  From walking to your table through the kitchen the whole experience is a trip to an Italian family type restaurant.  The portions are family style which serve 2 to 4 people so you need to divide the entrée price by 2 or 4 when comparing to other restaurants.  Although I do not normally like chains Bucca Di Beppo is an exception - I will go there at any port of call that I find one - FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"If you have a hungry crowd, then this your Italian joint.  Caution, its family style:  large portions is an understatement."}
{"text":"About as good as you would expect from a chain restaurant. The service was great, the food was okay. It's a good place for big families like ours to go when we all get together."}
{"text":"Everything is severed family style.  In other words what ever you order (even small) is at least enough for 2.  As such if there's only two of you, you're eating the same thing unless you order twice as much food as you need.  Not digging that.

Also everything is a la carte so you're also eating the same side dishes.  Again, not digging it."}
{"text":"The place was ok. It's gigantic just like their portions. It almost looks like a maze. Cool pictures everywhere! The food was all right. I ordered calamari and they were a little bit overcooked in my opinion. Italian sausage and peppers, on the contrary, were delicious. They were in the side dish section, but to me it was a real meal lol. Our server was great and was trying to accommodate my needs, too bad in the kitchen they were not really prepared ( no ranch and no tartare sauces). The service is very fast. As for the price, this place is only convenient when you go there with your entire family. So you can order one plate of spaghetti for like 30 bucks and be full. Me and my boyfriend are not big eaters, so it was a little bit of a waste for us. The sour note was that when I ordered my wine I made sure that they would bring me the house wine, it was supposed to be around 8 dollars a glass. And when the check arrived we saw that they charged us 15 dollars. Is it just a mistake? I don't think so. We will not come back."}
{"text":"Jarrett provided exceptional service!  It was a night of great food and entertainment!  Turned Monday blues into a fun filled night!"}
{"text":"Well I see why the ratings are so low.  You are a chain restaurant...why do you think it is appropriate and OK to charge someone and I mean ONE person $20 for lasagna and $15 for a Caesar salad at a CHAIN restaurant that is nothing special?  They don't have food for one person.  Their lasagna for $20 feeds 2 people and the Caesar for $15 feeds 3 people.  I do not care.  I am one person staying in this hotel next door and do not need food for 3 people nor am I going to pay $35 plus tax plus tip so around $45 for lasagna and a Caesar salad.  I just got back from Florence, Italy where real Italian food is...good Italian food and I didn't pay more than $15- $25 for an entire meal for myself there & that was with a glass of wine.  NOPE"}
{"text":"Came here with the 4 for $40 deal where 4 people can share a family style pasta, salad and bread.  It's a pretty good deal, the catch is that none of the pasta dishes that you can choose from have meat, so it's pretty much a vegetarian meal."}
{"text":"Sup fam. I wasn't gonna do it, but I gotta do it - a review that is. If you ever wanted to live like a Don from The Godfather while having a food baby, this is the place to be.

On my last night in Scottzy, I decided to hit this place up with my crew. First - servings are enough to feed a small village in the Amazon basin. Second - more seasoning and deliciousness than in the entire British cuisine from the past 500 years.

They did have a bit of a mix up on our order, but I gotta give 5 stars because not only did my main man Manny be super courteous, but the manager came over personally and let us get that part of our meal on the house. Aka - they dope.

So ladies and gentleman, get your rear down there and enjoy the fine Italian cuisine in a dope setting with kind peeps."}
{"text":"If only the seating was more comfortable, this would not be such a bad restaurant.  All the seats, chairs, were so crammed into one another. Trying to get out of your seat to go wash up was so inconvenient to everyone who had to get up, or pull their chair forward so that you can move. 

The food that was selected by the host of our party was greasy. 

Over all....  not a great experience."}
{"text":"We like Buca for informal family gatherings.  Going to Buca means everyone will find SOMETHING they like.  It means we will have leftovers.  It means we won't have to clean up after ourselves.  

The quality of Buca noticeably deteriorated after Planet Hollywood took over.  We'd been going to Buca for years in various states and things we loved started to disappear.  For example, Buca used to give you really good complimentary rosemary focaccia when you sat down.  Now they give you a semi-crusty white bread with zero flavor.  What do you want to bet they started selling more garlic bread and bruschetta when they stopped giving you the good free stuff?!  The portion sizes also changed noticeably. 

Still, you always have enough to eat (or more than enough).

You always also have a good time.  How can you not?  We always look forward to seeing the old pictures... especially of old Italian movie stars, The Pope and various mischievous children.  

Is this the best, most authentic Italian food around?  No.

But they do have a lot of Italian-American classics that your family will surely enjoy.

I can't give it a 4 stars due to commonly having received extra slow service (due to the kitchen) on busy nights and usually having a wait even with a reservation.  But the food is definitely better than, say, Chili's or other like-priced places.

It's served family style for the most part, but you CAN get individual portions of most things at lunch.  

Want a tip?  If you're craving spaghetti but you don't want to order a full portion, you can order the SIDE of spaghetti for only $5.99!  It is about 1/2 to 2/3 the size of the small spaghetti at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times now and can definitely say it's a great place to come to for Italian. If we're being completely honest here, I'd pick this place over Olive Garden any day. Yes, they may not have the never ending breadsticks or salads but I can live without it in place of some hearty and good ol' Italian food. This place is family style and most small dishes can be split between 2-3 people. Yes, they are huge. I took my boyfriend here because he had never been and he had nothing but awesome things to say about it. We ordered the small Caesar salad which allotted for 2 servings each. He ordered the Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken and I ordered the Shrimp Scampi.  For drinks I ordered their red sangria and he ordered their Primo Margarita and both drinks were yummy. Our server Luis was very attentive and helpful with any questions we had regarding the menu. Our main dishes were huge and tasty. The prosciutto came with 3 pieces and the scampi was enough to feed 4-5 people. I had it for lunch for the rest of the week. I would definitely go back especially since its down the road from me. I just need to get out a little more. You know how it is..."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife to celebrate our anniversary and had a great time. Our server was very knowledgeable and very friendly. The food portions are huge and everything was delicious. We had the spaghetti with meatballs and garlic bread. Made our night very special."}
{"text":"Huge portions to have family style. 

Decor is ornate. There are little private areas for a party or large group or in a open area with others.

Generally walk through the kitchen to get to your table.

The staff is super friendly and instantly make it a fun atmosphere for all, they really seem to cater to families and with the large portions you definitely want to eat family style. 

Love the thin crust pizza, lasagne, meat ball and spaghetti and especially the chicken Marsala and the Calamari. 

Great food and highly recommend going with a large group."}
{"text":"I was in town with a bunch of others on business and the last night we were looking for a place that could accommodate about 20 for dinner.  It was a challenge given the PGA tournament being in town and we wound up at Buca.

I was kinda down given I know it's a chain and that there are lots of other good dining options in Scottsdale but, it was what it was and in general, I left with a decent impression. The best parts were the combination of good service and just general atmosphere that was perfect for a large group.  Family style dishes to be shared and sitting around a set of tables arranged into a large square made for good conversation and an overall fun evening.  

In terms of the food, it's 3 stars, e.g. A-OK.  Nothing special to write home about but tasty overall and definitely filling.  The server recommended how many apps, salads, entrees should be ordered for a group that size and we took the recommendation and added on with a couple pizzas.  Everything came out hot and quick and the service was on top of things from the start.

I likely would not go to a Buca di Beppo for a dinner with the wife and kids but could actually see it as an option for a family reunion type deal."}
{"text":"If you go to this location,  ask for Nick to be your server. I sure wish that I had. He served the table behind us and a couple were seated as we were taking our order and they were served their BILL before we were served our entree. Our server told us that our entree would be out shortly and then went to another table (who was also seated after us and left before we got our entree) and chatted with them for about 10 minutes. When he took their credit card for processing he noticed that we still had no entree on our table and clearly scrambled. He ran to get it and it was obvious that our dish had been sitting for several minutes. It was dried out and was very light on marinara sauce. We asked for a separate dish of marinara. He went to input the order behind the bar but started serving patrons at the bar instead. After several more minutes we were able to flag down Nick to ask for a manager and he kindly offered assistance. He explained that the manager had to drive to another Buca location to pick up marinara sauce because this ITALIAN restaurant had run out! 

This highly disappointing experience wasn't entirely our servers fault I admit. However the situation would have been avoided if he had just communicated with us anything instead of finding ways to avoid us. Granted he took the dish off of our bill and comped a glass of wine which was nice but the damage was done. I love Buca and they haven't lost me as a customer but this location has. Next time I'll go to the location that keeps their marinara sauce in stock."}
{"text":"Super basic or main stream Italian food but I don't care. This the local Buca & I come here pretty often. Always good service & the food is good. Maybe it's not authentic food but I always have a great experience. There's always coupons. They sing on your birthday. Not to mention the decor, probably my favorite thing about Buca! I like bringing large parties here especially when we get the pope room. We can all share the family style served food & the room is almost private!"}
{"text":"Manager brought water outside and in the lobby for those waiting. Food was good. Service was good. Not the most expeditious place but if you have ever eaten in Europe it's about the company and fellowship. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"This week I hosted a team dinner at Buca. So straight away I tried to call the restaurant 3 times today to express my concern about the quality of our dinner to honestly avoid a less than average Yelp review. On the first phone menu option it just rang fast busy. Second menu option put me on hold for a few minutes and then I was notified the subscribers mailbox was full - so here we go.

Love the restaurant, the ambiance is fun, and have always had good meals here. This week the food was so subpar. Our server (Joshua) was great - no complaints here at all. And because this was a work dinner I was not going to cause any issues with bringing up the food quality with my team present. 

Management team - if you want to reach out to me directly for specifics please do so. Again my interest is not to publicly criticize here - I am just interested in providing feedback to help address our issues. 

Thank you,
Bryan"}
{"text":"We have been there a few times.  The service is great and there's something for everyone on the menu.  The kids love it."}
{"text":"Thank goodness our server was good.  The food is flavorless, over cooked and overpriced.  We sat in the Pope room, which is fun, but the clears box the Pope sits in was fithly, perhaps taking a cloth to clean the glass or at least dust it off would be beneficial.  I already had a predetermined thought that if the main guy is dirty the food probably isn't going to be very good.  There are much better places than this.  Won't be back."}
