{"text":"Love.this.place!! The Bartender was very helpful. They have a decent selection of craft beers on tap...for a hotel bar. The chorizo flat bread was delish. A nice little oasis in a sea of crappy strip mall options."}
{"text":"The food here is great! My husband and I ordered room service while we were staying at the Wyndham Garden hotel. The food came quickly and the portions were  HUGE! The prices are totally reasonable. The house salad is the size of an entree salad and the train wreck tater tots were ridiculously good.  This is definitely a old option as there is not much else in the area. I wouldn't call this your everyday dinning spot as it very much so have vacation type food. We were overall very satisfied."}
{"text":"I liked very much, ordered the house burguer with fries, the fries was amazing, and the burguer surprises me! the meat is delicious! 
nice drinks and the space is pleasant! Bar server was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"OK, listen to me Liberty Kitchen. The House Burger was delish! So were the fries. Lower the price on everything and it will bring in customers off the streets. It's that good. Now the bad part. Liberty Kitchen, what does that mean? No theme at all. It has the black ceiling, but what good does that do. there are no lights. put in some Floor lamps, make it cozy. Lower the happy hour menu  prices by 50% except the fries. Make it $1.00 a plate (the big plate) for happy hour. OK, got it?"}
{"text":"Pot pie! Try it ASAP! Sooooo good it's my go to place if the wife is working late and I want a great truffle pot pie!"}
{"text":"Hotel is ok and near where I needed to do business. When the front desk told me they had a \"great little restaurant\" I thought \"Yeah, right.\" After reading reviews I decided to stick around for happy hour menu. No brainier since there's nothing good within walking distance. So here's the skinny...the chicken pot pie is amazing! Comforting, crunchy veg, chunks of chicken, black pepper, perfect crust. At $7 on the HH menu it can't be beat! Service slow but in a relaxed way. Great place to hang out if you're tired of your room."}
{"text":"Weird that it's located in a hotel. We came for happy hour. I ordered the sweet potato fries after reading some raving reviews. I was disappointed. Didn't love them. I also ordered the truffle chicken pot pie. It was awesome! Perfectly browned on top. Delicious inside."}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming here. Great staff and drink selection. They should add chips and salsa / guacamole to the menu though."}
{"text":"Dinner last night at Liberty Kitchen. Chicken Pot Pie was a happy hour special and was fresh and satisfying. Better than your average hotel restaurant. Wine list had three choices. Several beers on tap."}
{"text":"Lots of food at a great price.    The staff was attentive and friendly.  The sweet potato fries were delicious.  The pot pie was tasty as well.  

The bartender was great and made the family root beer floats.  

The whole family is definitely full after this meal.   Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Food is EXCELLENT, if only my pot pie wasn't so greasy I may have given this place 5 stars. I would definitely come back here to eat. The foods a bit pricey but if you have a voucher from groupon or from the hotel itself then the total bill shouldn't come out too much.

The train wreck tater tots were exceptional, the tots were perfectly made & EXTRA crispy. The meat on top of the dish was surprising flavorful & moist."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a need to be discovered restaurant. Sadly its hidden in the Wyndham hotel....il be honest its not a cool ambient(PEOPLE PUT SOME MUSIC!!!!) but the food makes up for it. They have great happy hour for food. We tried 3 things from there: sweet potato pries($5), pot pie($7),  the jalapeño bacon and pistachio brittle($2.75).

Trust me people get thos sweet potato fries. Perfectly fried, then drizzled with a marshmallow sauce, topped with candied pecans and mini marshmallows, and then toasted. You get these burned marks that just elevate the taste. Its sweet, salty and savory. Who ever came out with this, is a genius. Sadly i erased the picture by accident otherwise you would see the glory of this dish.

The brittle is good but more like a dessert. 

The pot pie was really good and hearty. I wish the crust would be more flaky, it was really invisible and could not taste. 

Not on the happy hour menu but extremely delicious is the House Burger. The meat was amazing and juicy. Asked for medium and it was cooked perfectly. Comes with jalapeño bacon which adds a spice to it.  I do believe its overpriced at $14.75 but really worth it if you have the money and don't mind paying. 

I will definitely come back for the sweet potato fries and to try that Angry Bird chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Love love their beet salad!  Inside hotel on Osborn great late afternoon stop"}
{"text":"Awesome hotel that is independently run. Happy hours is on the weekend as well between 4-7. Drinks are 4-6 dollars. The buffalo wings are a hit as well as the garlic Parmesan fries. Also the pot pie is awesome. The staff there are amiable which allows it to truly be happy hour. 

There is no real need to live the hotel. The location is near other hotels. Walgreens is within walking distance and they sell alcohol. 

If ever in Phoenix I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Wings with porter buffalo are superb the house burger is totally worth the price the house salad is huge and the breakfast buffet is so fresh and clean. Ever if you are not a hotel guest go there for the food and happy hour alone a hidden gem in central Phx."}
{"text":"I have stayed at this hotel for over 5 years and been to the Liberty Kitchen and bar quite a few times. The happy hour is great with unusual food like the brittle at a super price. They used to have a chalkboard with great local craft beers but no longer offer those. The truffle pot pie is very filling and delicious. The place is starting to look run down and not as clean and inviting though."}
{"text":"This place has indoor tables, a bar, and outdoor seating.  We ate here twice for dinner and enjoyed our food both times.  

Cuban Sandwich: it's pressed, like a panini, and comes with awesome french fries.
Bavarian Pretzel: comes with champagne mustard and cheese dip.  Really good, but I thought it was overpriced at $10.75.
Chicken Pot Pie: best pot pie I've ever had.  Loved it!  

This place is open until 10pm and has happy hour from 4-7pm.  I liked their wide variety of beers, but found that the mixed drinks were very weak."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick and delish meal. Highly recommend the black bean hummus and brittle"}
{"text":"House burger was great, server was friendly and they take non-menu requests if available. Recommended to visit at least once while staying at Wyndham Garden Hotel."}
{"text":"We had a great time hanging out here while staying at the Wyndam.  When we first walked in, the bar was dead and we figured it was probably always like that.  Little did we know the bunch of characters we would meet and such fun we would have.  We pretty much closed the bar and I'm pretty sure that prior to all the arrivals, the bartenders thought they would have an easy night.  Instead, they were asked such things as going to the kitchen to find some pickle juice.  Yes, really.  But Parker and, I believe, Chelsea were great sports and awesome both nights.  Much thanks to those two for their wonderful accommodating souls.  

In addition to the wonderful service, they also have local beers on tap, including one of my favs Uncle Bear's Mandarin Wheat.  Who woulda thought?  They do have food but we ate out so didn't eat.  Nice to know the option is there though.

This is a great spot to check out if you're staying nearby!"}
{"text":"Disappointing atmosphere, service, and drinks. We tried the hot mess tots, angry bird, pot pie, and chorizo and egg flatbread. Pot pie was pretty amazing but everything else was fairly bland and forgettable. I hope this place figures it out and finds a way to get some new customers in, it could be cute and is very convenient, once you find the place. I would recommend they update the dining furniture, lose the buffet tables, and get some live music or trivia going for entertainment.  There is still potential here"}
{"text":"Whoa!!! this place was 6 stars!! We live in Summerlin in Vegas and eat at 5 star restaurants regularly. A hotel restaurant this good?? Amazing. Everything from food, service and atmosphere was superb!! Nick the manager was great! Even if you just live in Phoenix and don't stay at this  Wyndham, you have to eat here! truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"As previously reported, bar service was fast and friendly.  I choose the bourbon BBQ crispy chicken wings, which were 6 wings for around $12..  They were slightly over fried, but the sauce rather masked it.

I also had a salad, which was as any other mixed green salad.

One nice thing about this joint is it's open at 10p on a Sunday, so it was a life saver having rolled into town around 9p!"}
{"text":"This place has good food beer and drink selections!  I have stayed here twice and had good service both times.  This time tried the chorizo flatbreat and it was a great happy hour snack.  The company says they are closing at the end of March and the company is not doing a good job stocking items or telling out of town guests about this before they checked in."}
{"text":"Im on edge between 2 and 3 stars. I stayed in the hotel and ate here 2 different nights for convenience. When I first saw the menu I was stoked on multiple options I wanted to try, but 3/4 of them let me down. The 1st night I had the fried pickles (which couldn't even keep their batter on them & it slid right off) & the veggie burger (which was the ONLY saving grace to this review). I got a beet salad to-go to have for lunch the next day, & was boring and way too overpriced. Also, the greens were tossed in an oily-something (though the dressing was on the side) which made no sense in serving that way since I asked for it to-go, so the greens would obviously get limp if not eating it pretty immediately. The next night I got the mac n' cheese bread pudding...which was not at all what the name describes it to be. It was medicire mac n' cheese with bread pieces baked on top with some added cheese. The bread was tasty but it was the smallest dish ever, insanely overpriced for the size, & didn't even come close to resembling bread pudding! It sounded so unique so I had to see what it was... but it should have been called \"side of mac n' cheese with bread crumbles.\" Service the 1st night was pretty medicre/poor too, & I was sitting at the bar at her fingertips. Weird comments & no attention paid to refilling my water, even with the empty glass right in her face. I won't even stay at this hotel again since I need a good, convenient restaurant in the hotel when I'm travelling for busy business trips."}
{"text":"Angry Bird chicken sandwich was good. Also tried the potato tots with shredded beef. Potato tots were soggy and the shredded beef was dry.. 






."}
{"text":"Bar service was fast and friendly.  Potato tots done wile nachos were excellent.  Nice craft beer selection. Well above average for a bar resturant!"}
{"text":"So what they don't tell you is this place is in the lobby of a hotel... Really not an issue but was looking for a stand alone facility.  Initial impression was good, nice atmosphere overlooking a covered patio.  

I went in on a late Sunday afternoon, bar was busy (not a huge place) and there were a few other customers in the dining area.  Had to have the jalapeño, pistachio, bacon brittle, it was FANTASTIC!!! Just the right amount of crunch, heat and bacony greatness to satisfy.  Good size portion for the price, enough to share with 3 or 4 others.   Had the angry bird with tots for the entree and it did not disappoint.  Great flavor from the green chile and avocado, greens were good and the bread was just right.  Tots had a great seasoning and were fried to the perfect crispness, not soggy.  Dip them in the horseradish sauce the sandwich comes with... And watch out!!!

Service was good, a little slow, but food came out timely and the waitress was attentive when she was around. 

Great place, great price (especially during happy hour)...."}
