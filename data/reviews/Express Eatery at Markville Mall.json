{"text":"It's a food court.  You go in....select your choice of grease food, sit down, eat and bin it.  get a grip. who the heck needs to make a special trip to see a food court? that bored people?"}
{"text":"To Cadillac Fairview, your food courts need wifi.  Without it you are 1 Star'd."}
{"text":"Amaya is great, but otherwise this is just a slightly above average food court in terms of selection.   I give Markville huge points for creating a beautiful space and improving the overall experience, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"A little disappointed that the same boring restaurants reopened in the new location. KFC, A&W, Mr. Sub and New York fries - boring! They did open a new Indian restaurant that looks good but I didn't try it yet. They are also opening a Harvey's (I do hove a Harvey's burger) and a wrap place shortly. The place looks better than the old food court but feels a little cold."}
{"text":"Amazing space now that the food court has been fully renovated. It feels much bigger and has an open-concept sense almost. They did attempt to put more natural lighting in the middle/walkway - super bright, airy, and spacious to walk around. There are plenty of seats, and even during peak lunch hours, you probably won't need to wait too long for a table or seat. In terms of choices though, it's pretty standard options - KFC, Amaya, A&W, Taco Bell, nothing too special."}
{"text":"Huge improvement compared to the old food court.  Bright and has lots of seats.  It's nice to have an extra elevator in the mall as well.  There's an array of food choices and at different price points.  I wished Tim Hortons moved into the Express Eatery.  It would be awesome to have a Timmy's after a meal."}
{"text":"Express Eatery at Markville Mall is not worth a special trip!  I was hoping that it will be similar to Urban Eatery or Dine on 3.   Here at Express Eatery, you will only find your standard food court's options: Manchu Wok, A&W, Taco Bells, KFC............   Styrofoams, plastic utensils...   It is though really bright, spacious and airy... love the different options of seating though.   Just wish more interesting vendors will move in one day........"}
