{"text":"Seule réelle option pour s'alimenter autour du Stade Olympique, la Station In Vivo offre de délicieux sandwichs, soupes et viennoiseries. Le service est assez rapide et les employés sont très sympathiques! Parfait pour se restaurer sur l'heure du dîner ou prendre un café accompagné de l'un des excellents muffins!"}
{"text":"La Station In Vivo est le seul restaurant dans le grand vide qui encoure le stade Olympique. Heureusement, ils servent d'excellents sandwichs, muffins et de fameux croissants aux pistaches quand vous avez la chance de pouvoir en acheter un...L'endroit est propre, moderne et accueillant."}
{"text":"Very cute, efficient, tasty cafe inside Stade Olympique near the Pie-IX station on the green line. They serve your basic assortment of coffees, pastries and sandwiches. It's really the only place of its kind if you live near Pie-IX or Viau stations. Over the course of our several day visit, we got lattes and sandwiches. Lattes were very good. My wife even took hers without sugar, which is rare for her. This just attests to how good the coffee is. The sandwiches were toasted in a panini press and were warm, crispy and bursting with flavor. They use what I believe is a mustard/mayo combo, which is quite yummy (and I usually hate mayo). Prices are average for Montreal and a little cheaper than Old Town or Downtown."}
{"text":"Discovery of independent coffeeshop continues with our passport barista! This coffeeshop is located inside of Olympic Stadium and there is a direct access from the metro!   It's a quiet illuminated and spacious place! The color scheme is yellow and white; in winter it will feel sunny! The sitting area is modern design; funky!   The service is very good and amiable.   I got the London Fog (earl grey, milk, lemon and vanilla extract). It was a wonderful drink for a cold weather.   A cute spot to hangout with friends and coffee!"}
{"text":"In a sometimes seemingly abandoned station, this is an oasis of life. When it was raining, it was the perfect place to grab some good coffee and pastries. I loved the brownie. When heated this thing is amazing.   There are multiple long tables for work and free Wifi. Large windows let in ample light."}
{"text":"I went with a couple friends to have some coffee. We both opted for a London fog. It was my first and I really enjoyed it. The only downfall, because it's served in a wide mug, it gets cooled quickly.  It's a very cute bright lite and modern cafe. They serve some cold cut food, salads, baked goods.   You can sit at a table or these funky designed long bench (which you share with the person sitting behind you). It's a cute cafe right in the Olympique stadium. You can also access it through the metro!"}
{"text":"PieIX metro lets you out right next door to this comfortable big bright cafe on Pierre de Coubertin, built right in walls of the crazy ole Big O. Age is not being super kind to the O itself, but the cafe looks modern with its great big flat comfy couch seats at odd angles for putting brains together and making storms. Free wifi and big windows and good coffee are all I really need from the working world some days, and this place hits a win all across the board. The rhubarb square was delicious too, and in the summer you can catch the Velopousse bike service right outside the doors for a cheap trip down to the cutest bars and bistros and heritage buildings in HOMA."}
{"text":"L'endroit est propre et reposant. La nourriture était excellente et le service très bien. Je suis allé pour dîner, car je disposais de peu de temps.  Le service fut rapide et courtois (nous étions un petit groupe de 6).  Pour 20$, j'ai eu droit: sandwich, salade de pâtes, dessert, café et eau. Bref, un endroit sur pour un repas rapide."}
