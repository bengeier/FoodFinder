{"text":"Awesome place. Great beer prices and food and Shane is a phenomenal water. Extremely attentive and efficient not to mention Shane has a great deal of charisma."}
{"text":"The crossroads of bad food and worse service. Some of the food was so bad that one taste made you spit it out. The rest of the food was cold. The server was never to be found. We had to get up and search through the restaurant four different times when we needed our server. Don't waste your time or money here. Your better off eating fast food."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night, wasn't that busy. We sat in the lounge and did like the amount of TV's with different sporting events. Waited about 5 minutes for a server (not ours) to come and take our drink order. About 10 minutes later our drinks came, then waited for another 10 minutes for our server to take our food order. All we ordered was an appetizer, which took about 20 minutes....point I am making is it took a long time to place and receive drinks/food.
The NNY Combo Platter was good, not sure the wait is worth it though!"}
{"text":"Dang it, why do I keep coming back. Crappy service everytime. Getting a menu here is near impossible after the sunsets. Getting the waiters to come over afterwards is even harder."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I've gone in the night & sit down. It's like a ghost town...No one comes over to take our order. Sitting at the bar tonight and no bartender around. So I get up and leave. Not happy with this."}
{"text":"Best service I've had in years
We had the fish and chips
Very well done
My only suggestion is the need more dressing on the coleslaw"}
{"text":"Blah... The service was poor the food was average and the place reeks of bleach water... I won't come back."}
{"text":"Bad experience... After 45 minuets of ordering food. We decided to pay for your drinks and leave with eating. Bartender was very apologetic, but seem to really not care. The manager was clues on what was going on. What a disappointment, with been a big fan of Native NY. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"I have been to the place several times with large and small groups and haven't been disappointed once. I think their honey hot wings are the best period (better than Buffalo Wild Wings and Teakwoods). Service has been real good too. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar. Well at least the side I go to. The other side is a restaurant but I wouldn't be throwing out 4 stars for their food!

Big HD TVs! Lots of them... That is what we want in a sports bar, right? Plus, they buy all of the sports PPV stuff. Cold beers, Big HD TV's, chicken wings and the game - this makes me happy!"}
{"text":"this is for the superstition location in the far ne valley wings and a salad 5.99 not a bad deal 8 wings/salad service good beer selection  standard az bud, bud lt coors coors lt ect after i said do you have any good beers on tap she finally told me they had blue moon"}
{"text":"If you're into mediocrity, this place is for you.  3 stars because they couldn't mess up the tater-tot appetizer and the queso sauce was tasty.
Roast beef for the French dip tasted old.  French fries were overly seasoned and apps and soups came out with the entrees."}
{"text":"Wow. I have been to many restaurants but this one takes the prize as the worst. I had high hopes. First service was slow. Took forever to take our order. Waitress brought us a stack of appetizer plates. We did not order an appetizer. Plate on top had some black oily film on it. Back side was much worse. Informed waitress she laughed and carried it away saying something about her hang over. Next my husband opened his napkin to find encrusted food on the fork and napkin. He grabs another. Same thing on the next one. Waits an eternity for more silverware. Waitress comes back. He informs her of this, giggles, says sorry and walks off. Food was bland and boring. Never again."}
{"text":"I found the worst service restaurant in AZ. The app came out minutes before lunch. I had to ask 2 times to get a fork and napkin. I had to beg for a refill and the only thing promptly given was the bill. That happened to be wrong as she charged me for a side salad which I didn't receive but ordered it. I said I received fries soothe salad should be removed and the bill reduced. Then her response was well actually fries are more expensive so you are getting a discount. Thanks Miranda, I'll hopefully never see you again. If you hate your job , which is obvious, please quit and find something you are good at."}
{"text":"Food is good, but they seem a tad understaffed. The staff they did have was hustling and friendly, but way over worked."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Great staff and atmosphere.  Food was really good and service was outstanding.  If you want a place to hang out this place is it."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker is an okay WING place..

Meaning wings are okay, can't ever go wrong with well done wings anyway

Servers aren't attractive like hooters or anything similar.

Just another food + bar franchise I guess you'd call it. No big deal. I personally like hooters better."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you are hungry.  We waited 10 minutes before someone sat us. After ordering our drinks it took 15 minutes to see our sever again to order food. After we ordered food it took 30 minutes for our appetizer to arrive. I have never waited 30 minutes for tortilla chips and spinach artichoke dip. The server warned me that the bowl was hot. The bowl was very hot but the center of the dip was still refrigerator cold...... I informed the server and she said she would be back with another.  15 minutes later she arrived with ANOTHER cold dip. I changed my order and waited.... after another 45 minutes without our entree we asked for a manager. After 10 minutes no manager showed up and we left without our food. If you own a tv and a microwave save your time and money, just cook at home. All these guys do is use a microwave and they cannot even handle that. I should also mention that the restaurant was not even half full. They will receive none of my business. ..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, drinks, service and reasonably priced. The Native New Yorker - Phoenix and Mesa are tops for the best buffalo wings !   
I highly recommend this restaurant!!

Thanks.

{"text":"Wings are sooooooooo delicious. I get honey bbq. I live in California now and there is not one here so when I visit AZ, I try to make it a point to come here when I can."}
