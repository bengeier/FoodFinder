{"text":"Ok final update on Dundas Spring Garden. I think they've earned their place back in my good books.   This is still our go to for Chinese delivery. Always through Tasteaway (do a google search for promo codes! I always get at least 15% off!)  Go-to order is: Spring Rolls, Singapore Fried Vermicelli, Sichuan Crispy Shredded Beef, Steamed Rice, General Tso chicken.   Still looking for another chicken dish, General Tso can be hit or miss, but the chicken balls are a definite MISS. Not sure how they fail here but the rest of the food is quite yummy and gives me my fix."}
{"text":"I usually do not give one star. But I wanna give this place 0 star... I ordered fried rice with shrimps. All the shrimps turned sour. I strongly do not recommend this place. The food quality really needs to be inspected."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down. I used to order delivery from here and it was my go to place for Chinese food. In my last order there was a giant cockroach in my food. I was completely disgusted. I called the restaurant about it and had some woman screaming at me that it couldn't be proven where the cockroach came from. DO NOT order from here. They need to be inspected."}
{"text":"First off if you are in Chinatown this should be the last place you should eat Chinese food! However I used just eat one night and was very disappointed. I ordered chicken corn soup which was probably the best thing of the 3 I ordered but then again how can you mess that up? A med soup was 7 bucks.   I ordered shanghai noodles and this is the worst shanghai noodles in the world. No joke even frozen dinners are better!! The noodles were not fresh and extremely soggy. As I write this review the memory  of the taste is making me feel disgusted with. Also what kind of shanghai noodle is sweet? On the menu its labelled as spicy with a chili icon but instead it was rather SWEET. Sweet and soggy shanghai noodles are the worst.   Next thing I ordered was pork dumplings which came steamed. $8 the price seemed ok I believe it came with either 10 or 12 but this was a tasteless dumpling which I was unable to finish. This place is a disgrace to Chinatown eateries. Please save your money and eat something decent as there are more options available.   Those 3 items came to be 30 bucks including tax. Seriously food court Chinese food at the mall makes this place look like a dump."}
{"text":"I usually order food from this restaurant online for chinese food. They give large portions for rice and fried noodles which I love. They're very tasty and delicious too.  I've also had some disappointing dishes from this place. Their general tso chicken was not good. The portion was average, not too little but not a lot either. I'm currently on the hunt for a certain lemon chicken, breaded and covered with lemon sauce. I've found that all the chinese restaurants I've ordered from are fried chicken with lemon dipping sauce. However this restaurant was most disappointing. Their dipping sauce was more like orange dipping sauce, not lemon. It was the colour orange and it tasted like orange instead. I had to dump the sauce away because it tasted gross.  I'd recommend their rice and fried noodles only."}
{"text":"Didn't recieve half of my delivery order but paid for it. Was told it's not their fault and oh well. Woman screaming at me. Opened my veggtables and found an earwig or cockroach sitting right on top. NEVER EVER AGAIN. That's what I get for not waiting an hour for new Ho king to open. THIS PLACE IS THE WORST. The city needs to shut them down."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and not only did they forget the fortune cookies (which i see others have posted the same thing) But the delivery guy ripped us off! He claimed he didn't have change, so he took the money I gave him and just walked away. I'm not pleased."}
{"text":"My husband always order takeout from this Chinese resto. The soups are pretty good and the portion is huge! We love the mushu, the shanghai noodles, the shrimp with lobster sauce, beef with black beans sauce, chicken with black beans sauce and the general tao. The delivery is fast. The Asian guy that delivers our food is nice too. whenever my husband and I are lazy to cook, we just order from them. The food is good and the price is good, not too expensive."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not fancy with its interior..its literally a plastic table cloth with a bunch of tables and tons of chairs.  This restaurant is a go to for my family because of its generous portions and budget friendly prices while still being authentic and delicious.  The service is okay its definitely more laid back because they are used to their regulars and dont really have new clients on a frequent basis.   They also have preset menus for a good deal.  Give this place a try if you want good affordable food!"}
{"text":"my family and i were walking around chinatown and we randomly decided to stop in here. we should have done our research better. the food was not good, the service was inattentive, and the wireless didn't even work.  we had the hot and sour soup, salted squid, spicy lamb stir fry, pea sprouts and mushrooms, and lemon duck.  the soup was incredibly bland, the sauce of the pea sprouts was kind of gelatinous. the lamb was decent, and the salted squid was really good, it was crispy and seasoned perfectly.  the biggest disappointment was the lemon duck, though i think it was probably my fault because it's a risky thing to order. but learn from my mistake and don't get it! the duck is battered and deep fried. the batter is really sweet and tastes like cake batter, and it settled in the crevices of the duck and was dense and not at all like it was even fried. the sauce that came with it was a super sweet, little bit sour gelatinous sauce that nobody touched. it was such an intense way to ruin duck and made me really sad.  the service was even worse. we were rushed to order and then ignored for the most part. had to practically beg to get refills on water and tea. the meal ended up being really expensive too, about eighty dollars for a family of four, after tax and tip. i guess we could have ordered less expensive stuff, but that still feels like a lot for what terrible food it was. learned a lesson with this one."}
{"text":"I ordered fried chicken dumplings to go. It took them 20 minutes and the restaurant was almost empty."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. The staff is friendly and what I like the most, it's never packed so I often come here with friends and we can hear each other talking.( It seems they do lot of take away and delivery services). Grandma's style fried  vermicelli is probably the best fried noodle in town. Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Dundas Spring Garden already had a couple favourable reviews, and for whatever reason we felt it would be an appropriate accompaniment to our Opposite Worlds viewing party (SyFy channel, Tue/Wed nights @10pm). We liked it, although I do have some quibbles and tips to share, with each dish scored as a reality game show:  SALT AND PEPPER SQUIDS Delightfully crunchy and flavourful - we were expecting a lot of spice, but there wasn't a particularly big kick to them. The portion was plentiful, but we could have used a little less breading. An original and interesting premise, but the execution was average, just like \"Average Joe\" (I was never certain the producers of that show understood the meaning of the word 'Average')  SEASONAL VEGETABLES WITH GARLIC SAUCE Just a simple greens-in-garlic-sauce. They were tasty and the portion was generous, but it wasn't something I would write home about. Like \"The Amazing Race\" it was a decent dish but I lost interest early once I understood the formula  BRAISED EGGPLANT This dish was a highlight - the box was overflowing with sweetly braised eggplant and a few scattered snow peas. Great flavour, and sauce worked excellently in tandem with the fried rice dish we ordered. In sum, a this dish had a standard premise, but a superior execution, just like \"Top Chef\".  SEAFOOD CHOW MEIN The chow mein as a whole was average (note, producers of 'Average Joe' that by 'average' I don't mean 'obviously way below average with distinct and prominent personality and physical flaws both physical) but the dish stood out because the boxed the crispy noodles separately from the seafood and vegetables, maintaining an exemplary level of crunchiness. A wonderful touch that all delivery should offer. Like \"Joe Millionaire\" which held my attention by offering a twist - I appreciated the effort, though in the end it did not blow me away.   SALTED FISH WITH CHICKEN FRIED RICE As pescetarians, we asked on the order to replace the Chicken fried rice with vegetables. We knew it was a long shot, and they did not comply...which was fine - my GF's brother happily took home a container full of chicken. The salted fish was saltier than Robert Shaw in Jaws...so salty I think I woke up in the middle of the night with a sore throat because of it. Not that I'm complaining...I LOVED it. So worth it. Eating leftovers right now as I prepare a middle- -of-the-night-water-and-lozenge-kit. I know it's not good for me, but I'm eating it anyway, a la \"Temptation Island.\""}
{"text":"When I order chinese food, it's from here. I've never been to the restaurant, but their delivery is speedy and accurate. I've ordered through tasteaway (with and without discounts) 18 times. They've only messed up my order once, minor thing too, forgot fortune cookies.   Was in search of a de facto chinese restaurant and this fits all the criteria."}
{"text":"Decent fast food delivery. Food came hot and average tasting. Since the delivery was free, the delivery guy decided not to come up to my apartment and meet me on the street outside because he couldn't find a spot. I ordered the wonton soup and the congee. Nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The food wasn't edible and took 1.5 hours for delivery. Literally had to call them back 3 times! Stay away. I ordered the honey garlic ribs it wasn't edible...!!!"}
{"text":"Kensey W has it nailed. Meagh! Tasteless food the way Chinese used to be in the 70s in Toronto. Tasteaway discount or not this has fallen of my radar never to be restored again. I guess P T Barnum was right about a sucker being born every minute and yesterday was my starring in this role."}
{"text":"My late night go to. Honestly never disappoint or exceed. Typical American Chinese food"}
{"text":"ordered via tasteaway at 40% off for pickup.  the shrimp and lobster tasted standard,   the other item, crispy ginger beef was a no go as it turned up chewy and rubbery. perhaps from the travel in the box, but would not order that again. also the beef had a decorative bed of noodle, which was stale, nasty and old. size for the beef was half to 3/4 filled box.  however, the other entree was filled to the top. both did not come with rice  place is mediocre..."}
{"text":"Ordered online for a few order of dumplings for the office, took 1.5 hour to get there.  People I ordered the food for already when home.  When the guy finally got there and I was like whats up with the long delivery time he said he called me.  I look at my phone it said i had a miss call one minute ago.  He put the food on the table and walked out complimenting our computer monitors and our desks, talking about everything but the food.  I knew I should have stayed away the second I saw chicken balls on the menu."}
{"text":"They should really call this place Chinese Food Roulette!  One time its great, the next time its terrible, If it were not for the Tasteaway discounts, I would never give this place another chance, but the discount was good and so we tried again.  This time the dumplings that were so tasty on previous visits were mushy and bland but the General Tso Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork was perfect!  The green beans with ground pork were as good as I have ever had, especially considering it was take out.  The Mu Shu Pork was great and if it had some/more egg it would have been perfect.  They were generous with pancakes but not with hoisin sauce...?  One of these days we need to go and dine in, but the problem is, I will always think to go to Yueh Tung or up to Markham for dine in Chinese before thinking of Dundas Spring Garden, but to give them a true test, I need to take the chance.  In the meantime, everytime Tasteaway is offering a big discount and I want to do Chinese take out, I will take another spin at the Dundas Spring Garden roulette wheel,"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I came here couple time and every time the food was delicious. It was cheap and came in big portions!!"}
