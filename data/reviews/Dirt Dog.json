{"text":"Had the Elote Dog. Amazing flavor, not too heavy on the toppings. One of the best things I've had to eat in quite a while. The fries are great too, but I didn't care for the chili. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love bacon wrapped dogs and horchata icecream?

This is easily my favorite hot dog place!  They have a small menu, but that's because what they have has been perfected.  I particularly enjoy the Red Dog in a lobster bun and garlic fries.

While you're here be sure to try their desserts!"}
{"text":"So let me start out by saying it was our first time eating here from the ad on Facebook this place looked great but when we got there not so much it had a great atmosphere but after that is where it started all going downhill first off let me say the picture of every hotdog that's representing this company has a lobster roll and they charge you extra for it that's a load of shit to start The hotdog quality was pretty sad I think 7-Eleven has better tasting hotdogs than them bacon wrapped I could Barely even taste the bacon for what bacon was on there their chili cheese dog tasted like something you get out of a shitty convenience store poor quality it's kind of sad you're spending eight dollars on a hotdog and you can get one for a dollar that taste way better their carne Asada fries are good
There Additional Mexican drinks they have there were literally empty yet they had it in the back some good that does you when you trying to sell your product The cashiers busy and her only job is to ring people's ordering maybe the food runners should step it up I will not return here was not impressed it should stay a hotdog stand at best don't waste your money not worth it"}
{"text":"Placed a pickup order about 30 minutes before they closed and when I got home and took a bite of it I realized they didn't even bother to wrap the hot dogs in bacon... very disappointing."}
{"text":"Cool little spot. Dogs are really good!! Toasted buns. The staff was Very friendly and don't forget dessert
Deep Twinkie and Oreos say what
A++"}
{"text":"Very cool vibe from the moment you walk in, creative menu, all Dogs are on point.  location is family friendly, 2nd location on the strip is also cool for those on the go. Recommend the Esquite corn, daughters favorite side"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and Jake is by far one of the best bartenders/servers that I have had experience with. An intimate knowledge of both the menu and beer selection, Jake has displayed his advanced knowledge of craft beer and gourmet hotdogs. The food is is a plethora of exquisite flavors and the sides are the perfect compliment to the main course of the meal. Dessert is all deep fried, guaranteed to satisfy any sweet tooth. If you're considering eating here, it definitely comes recommended from me."}
{"text":"Dirt Dog is awesome. Small spot tucked away, definitely easy to miss but worth checking out. I'm always looking for a reason to visit here, will bring visiting family to this spot. The menu lists some very creative and interesting choices. Would recommend the brown dog."}
{"text":"Pretty cool idea.  When you walk in, the first thing you'll notice is the upbeat, urban vibe.  It was pretty much west coast hip hop and rap the entire time we were there.  I'm not sure how this company started, but I get the feeling they used to be a food truck.  Like one of those good food trucks that has a constant line.  Food was a little more expensive than I would normally pay for hot dogs and fries, but it was extremely worth the extra couple bucks.  If you like spicy, they've got plenty of menu options for you.  My wife doesn't do spicy, and she still found something she loved.  We watched the second half of a soccer match just sitting there talking.  Good atmosphere to hang out.  They also have a pretty good beer selection if you're into that.  Overall, recommend!"}
{"text":"Veggie dogs, garlic fries, and beer- Oh my! 
Overwhelming deliciousness! 

We went on a Friday night, but left just as the DJ was setting up.  Hopefully we'll catch him next time.  

The deserts looked fantastic, but we were full from the dogs & fries.  

Staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"WOW... Hot dogs are unique and Delicious. Elotes are out of this world . Horchata Ice Cream is Great"}
{"text":"This place is good! I found this place on Yelp and thought I would give this a try. Everything we ordered were delish! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The moment I walked in I knew I would love this place! It has a very urban vibe, with classic hip hop and rock playing.. great food.. and extremely friendly staff! They serve beer and lots of other drink choices. I tried the \"dirty corn\" and it was amazing. I will definitely be visiting often."}
{"text":"Incredible hot dog, hot crispy fries, and friendly service. I would highly recommend this place if you are even slightly craving an amazing dog. Probably the best hot dog I have had in my life."}
{"text":"I had the brown dog and the corn in a cup. Everything was so flavorful and so much more than I expected. I can't wait to try everything on the menu! So worth it!"}
{"text":"Went in last night with my family it was a little busy but we didn't wait to long! This is the best hot dog I have ever had! The chili dog on Portuguese is the way to go. The servers/cashiers were friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food, but service was shit. They completely forgot my order and while I patiently waited three other parties got their food before me. It was some lady at the register and it was not busy either. Not how I wanted my first experience to go, but whatever"}
{"text":"Thus place is different then any other place in Vegas. Good dogs, good fries, and a real chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't believe they charge $6-7 bucks for just a hotdog. They could not tell me what brand hot dog they use just that it was all beef. The music was not appropriate , Snoop dog was playing with F* bomb's being dropped. Kids hearing that music is not a family friendly environment. Nothing special about the fries, the corn was cold and had no flavor. Will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Wow!  I don't eat hotdogs often, but after eating the Green Dig here today, I will go out of my way to eat here every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ok not the healthuest choice but they DO have a turkey burger and amazing corn on the menu! And beer! Not sure how business is because it's dead in there when we go... Great service! Will definitely go back. Be sure to get lots of napkins... lol"}
{"text":"Dogs are great but decided to try a different side this trip and went with the garlic fries. They came out plain so we asked the server about it. Server apologized and we just got the same fries with a sprinkle of garlic on top. Pretty sad for a place packed with flavor everywhere else on the menu. Not sure if I got cheated or a sprinkle of garlic pieces is really all you get??"}
{"text":"We tried four different dogs.... They were each sensational in their own way! GREAT PLACE! 
Both girls working the counter were super welcoming and had great recommendations. We will be back! I"}
{"text":"Customer service was great. After 100+ times driving by this place on my way home I finally stopped by. Stop by and ask about the secret menu. Good food and atmosphere. I will definitely comeback for dessert."}
{"text":"Perfect customer service!



Great food!




Absolutely delicious!

I really enjoyed coming here to the point I already spread the word to my neighbors:)"}
{"text":"Amazing dawgs! Must try!!!  Everything on the menu looks good but most importantly everything ordered was good. Try them all you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A dare turned addiction.

What's the big woop about hot dogs? Before my first visit, I truly thought all hot dogs were created equal ( or at least similar). Well, it turns out they are not. 

I've tried every dog on the menu. My fav being the house Dog and the red dog(i love anything spicy).

All dogs are not created equal. I've been back 5 times. Diet out the window. The dogs are imaginative, delicious (cooked wrapped in bacon), and hearty (5/1).

I tried to even direct the different breads. Ex. Portuguese roll: I traditionally don't like. The texture, saltiness and taste left me nothing to complain about.

My favorite bread is the lobster roll. I think it's a must. Like driving in a Bentley. Its as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Hotdamn! This place is great. I got the Red Dog and boy was it spicy and delicious. I got the garlic fries as a side and I enjoyed every garlic laced bite. 

I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Where do I start? The food is bomb, I got the red dog it was delicious to say the least, dirty fries & garlic fries are delicious super hot n crunchy, they were out of horchata so we got Jamaica n it was absolutely delicious we ended up buying more as they don't do free refills only free refills is fountain soda, got the kids fried Oreos n they devoured them also got the ice cream with the churro n it was beyond delicious everything was worth all my calories n carbs for the weekend lol love that they sell beer also  the music they play goes very well with the atmosphere lol the decor is chill with option for regular tables or high tables w/stools ok now the service...I'm huge on service and they are definitely on their A game very friendly, attentive and super fast bringing out food, continuously checking on guest with a friendly smile, everyone from the staff is doing something no one is jus standing. Love the place def will b a regular regardless of how far they are from me"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with LA inspired hotdogs. Why wouldn't anyone want to put a hot bacon wrapped weiner in their mouth and just have a foodgasm after? Honestly i've only been to two different hotdog spots like this and I highly approve of the idea. This brings eating hotdogs to a whole new level. 

I fell in love with the vibe as soon as I entered. They were bumping Pac in the back and had memorabilia of his genius. This is place is pretty lit and not too hard on the eyes.

So we ordered the Elote dog and some #Filthyfries. Both were amazing. They even gave us an extra ranchero dog on the side and man. I really appreciate that gesture because that one was my favorite. Be expecting me to head over again but don't get me wrong. I love the old Cheeburger Cheeburger spot however Dirt Dog became my new love. I'll be back to try the other dogs and fries. 

Food is an adventure am I right?"}
{"text":"Best hotdogs in town! We order carry out most of the time , but even at home the food is great. From the customer service to the corn and hot dogs everything is on point. Anyone looking for a good new spot to try this is definitely the place to try."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved it! We've been wanting to try this place for months now and it didn't disappoint. The fried Oreos came out of left field though..."}
{"text":"This place is damn good. The vibe might be even better than the food & thats saying something. The Mexican corn & horchata ice cream are a must. Staff is attentive and I have yet to get a bad hotdog. The only thing that I didn't like is how much ketchup is on the red dog but I don't really like ketchup on hot dogs. The green dog is by far the best."}
{"text":"Dirty chili dog was good, but wasnt blown away by it. Didnt have much chili on it. Decent garlic fries. Delicious deep fried Oreos! Overpriced for what you get, but still worth trying at least once. Still prefer Dog Haus."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on Yelp and wanted to try this place. On Tuesday evening at six pm it was quite. The staff taking the order and the person that brought our food were friendly. The restaurant was very clean and the seating was comfortable. We ordered the Brown Dogs with Dirty Fries and Craft Pilsner beers. The food was really tasty and the beer was nice and cold. We look forward to returning to try other items. The location is right in our neighborhood. Might be the best hotdog I've ever had."}
{"text":"The workers are nice and helpful, always a plus. The original dog is just perfect on a lobster bun with a side of dirty fries. The horchata with the churro ice cream is not to sweet, creamy and tasty. They have a secret menu so ask the cashiers. Also try some of their draft beers, the dark ones are good, but that's because that's what I prefer. The music is chill-some old skool, can't go wrong with that! So enjoy and trust me you will be back for more , stay dirty!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I was referred to Dirt Dog by a good friend and fellow foodie from Chicago, so when the restaurant received his endorsement,  I was immediately intrigued.  

My first question was could a dog shop, originally started in Los Angeles,  opening up doors in the desert of Las Vegas really be tgat good....Well, my friends, it is. 

I of course read some fellow yelpers reviews before setting out. Many suggested the lobster bun and one review warned of long waits. When I pulled into the parking lot there were several people at the front door and I thought, dang, here comes the wait, at least I had mentally prepared. As I approached the door, the crowd moved away, and I realized they were standing there in food comas, not waiting to order.  

Inside the business was clean and well lit, with a almost pub feel to it. There were several beers on tap. When I stepped up to order, I told the server it was my first visit and he immediately explained their simple, but delicious menu. 

I order \"The Mutt\", which is not on the menu moard, but a combination of the red and the green. Spicey and full flavored. I also ordered the corn on the cobb, it comes street vendor style, very messy and with lots of flavor.

I ordered to go, and waited about ten minutes,  which I honestly did not think was bad, but when the server brought my order to me, he said they threw in one of their \"house\" dogs for my ling wait! 

Needless to say, once I was home and the food was taste tested, it was a grade A hit. I highly recommend Dirt Dog for an early Sunday evening outing."}
{"text":"This place is very slow! Be prepared to wait. Also bring your own drink they are out of almost everything.  Service was below average, looks like nobody cares. I came once before when the first opened same experience but thought it was just because they just opened, now I know"}
{"text":"Legit Hot Dogs! 

Place is clean and well kept with cool decor. The cashier was so nice. It was probably pretty obvious we've never been to Dirt Dog and she was kind enough and super knowledgable to give  us the low down on a Secret Menu, which my Husband ordered the Mut Dog from, a mix of the Green Dog and Red Dog. 
I Ordered the Green Dog and it was amazing to say the least. The Dirty Corn is a must have. We also ordered Horchata IceCream and churro. My husband said he would come here just for that dessert. On top of all that, they were playing the jammmms! A mix of some 90s RB, some Elvis, Ben E. King...some super chill vibes! Definitely coming back and bringing some friends!"}
{"text":"Service is on point and my hot dog was off the charts!!! Never mad that good of a chilly dog before"}
{"text":"Best hot dog I have ever had, and I don't even like hot dogs and eat them once a year when I have too."}
{"text":"Great hotdogs!!! Perfect for the 4th of July. The dog was moist with a nice chew. The bun didn't get soaked up and soggy it was nice thick and buttery. The toppings had a great flavor. Really enjoyed the service. Noticed the beer flight, sad we didn't get one. Defiantly will next time."}
{"text":"I can eat here everyday that's how good it is!! Try everything I did but if I had to choose I'd go for the house dog in a lobster roll!!soo good!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and customer service is great .. they explain the menu if you have questions .."}
{"text":"Luved it I had the elote dog garlic fries delicioso the Cali vibe to top it off for sure will be back"}
{"text":"Creative take on dogs, street corn, tacos , good churros, 90s hip hop r&b - that's was I like"}
{"text":"Omg I'm officially hooked! I was so happy to see that they have a veggie hotdog called the veggie dog!!  love that they offer the soy based dog! You'll never know its soy based! The flavor is on point & love the lime to squeeze on as extra flavor. It's amazing and I'll definitely be a regular from now on! Welcome to Vegas Dirt Dog!"}
{"text":"This is the best hot dog east of LA
Just like my fav street vendor on Santee! Their street tacos are delicious too! 
Try the dirty corn! Yum"}
{"text":"Our first time here and the seating is pretty limited but the food is great! I got the chili dog and esquite corn with hot cheetos in it!"}
{"text":"I had been really looking forward to trying this place and unfortunately it was OK at best. Paying $24 for 2 hotdogs (one which they screwed up), 2 sodas, 1 corn and 1 French fry is not a good deal, even for the novelty of it. Perhaps this is why we were 1 of 2 tables during lunchtime. Next time I'm in the area, I'll go to Annie Pho next door instead"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place last night and YOOOOOO. It was pretty busy when we got there but we figured that was a good sign. Yes. That was an exact reflection of the food. I had the patty melt dog, and my girlfriend had the dirt chilli dog. We also shared garlic fries and the dirty esquite, which I didn't know how to pronounce so I just said \"dirty esssskeeeeettttiiiiiitttt\". Booooooy it was all fiiiire, homie. The buns are nice AF btw. You gotta eat here....frfr. If you show up zooted it will be even more enjoyable....that I guarantee."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER!!!!! Everything was great. I am not a hot dog person and today was my first time trying elotes but I must say the red dog and it's spice did not disappoint and the elotes ( dirty corn) was the best I had all day. I tried two other spots for elotes today and this by far was the best,3rd time is a charm. It is a clean restaurant and very spacious. They have the perfect person working the front. Forgot his name but he was a great guy!!!! Please please see photos, tho they don't do t justice and go here to eat some great food. Oh also had the chili fries bomb and the deep fried Twinkie and horchata ice cream. I mean damn..... just good."}
{"text":"****Update: As you can see the business owner had commented. This is a first that I have seen and I would say is commendable as he went out of his way and take his time to make it up to my family. For that we are truly grateful. That is one thing that is nice to see is that he takes customers feedbacks and go out of his way to try to make things right. Not alot of places and business owner do that. Even with the bad experience with food they delivered in customer service from the beginning. Thank you for understanding."}
{"text":"My wife and I just got done eating at Dirt Dog. This place is absolutely awesome. Great atmosphere excellent staff, and unbelievable food. What more can I say? Just get down here and check this place out."}
{"text":"Loved the environment and the food was great!! I had the Brown Dog, garlic fries and the ice cream!!! All were so delicious.  The food came out very quickly! The staff were very friendly and courteous. I would highly suggest you checking this place out if you are on rainbow!! It is tucked away in the corner of a shopping center with a good amount of parking. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"The food was disappointing and way too hyped up for what it is, plus the price.. I'd rather s*** in my hands and clap than go back there.."}
{"text":"This review is based on customer service.
Co workers took me to this place for lunch figuring it would be quick. 3 of us ordered at the same time and only one of us got our food within 5 minutes. Myself and the other guy got part of our food 20-30 minutes after and still wasn't complete. Our last item that we had ordered didn't come out till 45 min after which by then we had only 15 minutes left before heading back to work so we asked if we can just get it to go. To make things worse 2 guys walked in just before we left and they received their complete meals within a few minutes. I'm not one to get upset but this experience really made me not want to ever set foot there again. Staff at times showed great customer service and engaged with customers but at times also looked confused and seemed as if they didn't have a set plan to get food out to the customers within a reasonable time.  Aside from that the food does taste great. I have no complaints there. Maybe I'll give it a shot at a different time & day and hopefully I can have a  all around great experience. 

House dog, pepper fries and dirty corn all tasted amazing. Very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Best place to get a reminder of some well made LA food. I love the vibe of this place and the food definitely speaks for itself. The staff are beyond amazing and know how to treat their customers well! If it couldn't get any better, their craft beer selection is also worth it! Finally if your not fully stuffed with goodness HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE HORCHATA ICE CREAM! It's worth every penny. 
I specifically opened a Yelp account and posted this place as a first review for a damn reason, check this place out people!^_^"}
{"text":"My husband was dying to check this place out so we did after church. The establishment was nice, clean & pretty spacious. The menu was easy. I mean c'mon it's just hot dogs. We ordered 2 hotdogs, 2 sides & 2 drinks. Total came to $27, that included tip, which I thought was kind of expensive! My hubby ordered the house dog & I ordered the teriyaki dog. When the hotdogs came I was disappointed b/c the buns were way bigger than the hotdog! I felt that my hotdog was a bit dried despite the fact it had teriyaki sauce on it. I would think they would top it off with lots of onions & bell peppers but it was short of it. I would normally would use a fork & knife at a hotdog gourmet place, but at this place I didn't have too. We also ordered chips & from the picture on the menu I thought it would be more like the chips you get from Buffalo Wild Wings, you know crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, it wasn't! 

I think the best thing we ate was the corn esquite. Also, for a hotdog establishment I expected more beverage options, which they didn't have, however no big deal. 

It was worth a try."}
{"text":"Place was great, clean, friendly staff, & food was delicious! Hot dogs were awesome, desserts were delicicious, best of all the corn was bomb."}
{"text":"Get down here and try these hot dogs out. They are awesome, the sides are simple and great. Service is helpful and friendly. Great little spot in the southwest well needed."}
{"text":"love it!!!! A unique eatery only here and la.. wow!!! Yummy... Elotes to die for and choices of Dirt Dogs.  THIS place is definitely a one of a kind place and a need to try food once your in Las Vegas or in Los Angeles..."}
{"text":"First time for my husband and I last Friday!
The hot dogs were delicious and French fries too 
Can not wait to check the rest of the menu out!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad little spot for a good hot dog. Their corn corn was really good too. They have a nice little craft beer selection to choose from. Friendly staff always a plus!"}
{"text":"Easy, simple menu but really a variety of choices.  I wanted to try every item on the menu, we will be back! Excellent choice in fresh buns and hot dogs. Don't forget to grab the fried Oreos for dessert."}
{"text":"This place has the best hot dogs ever. The food is greasy but hey its a hot dog wrapped in bacon with amazing toppings! I got the Elote Dog and ugh it was incredible! The flavors were all on point and it came with a lime wedge on top! This place also has all sorts of games you can play while you wait for your food or you can play while you eat, and there were plenty of games to choose from like Monopoly Deal Card Game to Connect 4! Also the staff was very friendly! I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"OMG! This food is the bomb. Happy to have found this gem on Vegas strip. Chili dog, fries and Vegas style elotes were excellent"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. The people are super friendly and the food is amazing. The horchata ice cream is a dream!"}
{"text":"Ordered off the secret menu, Elote Dog w/Lobster, so good with the corn on the dog, on a lobster roll. Garlic fries good but not enough for three people."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I came out from Lakewood CA and was hoping to go to Mermaids Casino for some deep fried Oreos to learn that it closed. I looked up deep fried Oreos and found Dirt Dog. Service, food and all is spot on. I will definitely be coming back to Vegas."}
{"text":"We went for the first time on Saturday. The cashier informed me they were out of corn which we were looking forward to their corn fries. I ordered garlic fries instead. Once I paid for our meal the cashier gave me the heads that our food would take about 25 minutes. We didn't mind, we were just excited to finally check this place out. We went during lunch so it was pretty packed but we were lucky to find a table quickly. 40 minutes later our first half of our order came out. I informed the server we were still waiting on our kids' meals. 15 minutes later he brought it out. The server informed me that there was a miscommunication and they would be paying for our food since we waited so long. The server was very nice and I appreciate they acknowledged how long we waited. I ordered the chili hot dog. It was worth the wait! Even though we did not get our food as quickly as others, we're still going back! We can't wait to try their corn fries!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the 2nd time... and the #dirtychillidog with lobster bun was on point! And my boyfriend's #pattymelt with lobster bun with egg substitute the fries,  was amazing! The customer service was great! Tianna (Sorry if I spelled that wrong) , she was really wonderful,  great customer service! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.. took my family here n they don't like anything they loved their hot dogs. Very happy n great customer service"}
{"text":"They are a different take on hotdogs but they are all tasty!  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because it is a little pricey for hotdogs, even gourmet hotdogs."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot dogs on the planet!!! A must try!! I had the spicy dog with the butter toast! My goodness I'm in love!! The fries are perfect with great seasoning and the corn is amazing!! If this app had 10 stars they would get it!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were introduced to this place by a friend and we can both say that the customer service there is amazing! My husband's favorites are the house dog and the red dog when he's wanting something spicy. I'm more of a sweets person so I love their churro and fried Oreos! We would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes hot dogs with a twist!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to hear there was a hot dog joint in my neighborhood and Dirt Dog did not disappoint!  I had the House Dog and the dog itself was fantastic...all wrapped in bacon and YUMMINESS!!  I also had the Dirty Fries and they were great; not greasy, but full of flavor and a really generous portion.  The staff is really friendly and the service was very good and were open to suggestions (my husband suggested nacho cheese sauce).

Can't wait to go back and try other items!"}
{"text":"Saw it advertised on FB, went today with coworkers tried different dirty dogs, dirty corn and fries. All where awesome. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Simply went cause of the great yelp reviews. We weren't disappointed. 
I got the chili dog. Husband got the one with thousand island bacon dressing. 
Very good hotdogs. Both were unique and tasty. 
The oreos and the horchata ice cream were delicious as well. Only issue I see is the fries. 
Now, maybe if you load them up with stuff they're good but, they leave much to be desired. 
Oh almost forgot... the elote (corn) in the cup!!! Holy smokes is it delicious!!! Will come again."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Our kids loved the hotdogs and the atmosphere, this is a must eat if you live in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent service very attentive staff butt a single hotdog dog an ear of corn and a pint for $20 that is an insult!!!"}
{"text":"The Dogs are great but the music is definitely not good. Rap f... this f...that. \"I prey on sluts.\" Do not bring your kids! I would consider carry out but wouldn't dine in again."}
{"text":"Great food every time! When I have guests on town I always take them to dirt dog! My favorites are the elote and the mutt dog! You will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"This place is the best street dog I've had here in Vegas. I've been here a few times and the customer service is stellar. In particular Tianna , thanks again for the great service. If you want good food Don't go anywhere else. It's worth the money."}
{"text":"Best hotdog on Earth !!!! It's sooo good. My favorite is the Elote dog and corn. They are always on point."}
{"text":"First time coming to Dirt Dog and they did NOT disappoint. All of the staff was very friendly had smiles on their faces and looked happy to be at work. My girlfriend and i ordered 2 dirty dogs and chili cheese fries and dirty esquite.! The food was FRESH HOT AND DELICIOUS ! They gave us a complimentary order of elote fries which were AMAZING. The staff checked on us periodically. We also got a surprise complimentary order of Deep fried oreos ! And just like everything else they were so good . The atmosphere here is great you can play games or just enjoy the great hip hop that they play. Im overall VERY happy with my visit to dirt dog this will NOT be the last visit. We drove about 30 mins and it was worth it ! Thank you to all the staff at Dirt Dog keep it up"}
{"text":"OMG .... amazing place, had the ranchero dog, the Chili dog and the chili fries, the place has a great environment, tables with games for you to play. We started playing battleship lol. I also had a Deep fried Twinkie, go figure hahaa very recommended."}
{"text":"If you want an amazing HOT DOG and good people than this is the place for you!  Ask about their secret menu options!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my friend and I went to dirt dog since everyone is talking about it. We decided to give it a try. It was somewhat busy and the music was decent. The food was delicious and its the kind of food where you can just go all out. The girl who brought us our food was so nice and sweet. She was such a sweetheart I don't know if she said her name was Bria or Maria. But every time she came to check on us to see if we needed anything she had a smile on her face. She recommended the Horchata Ice Cream and we were not disappointed it was so good!! We will be definitely coming back since its not to far from our house!"}
{"text":"Loved loved loved it! The ambiance. The music. The food was super delish! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"It's 5 stars all the way with one exception so I had to give it 4 stars. I ordered the house dog it was awesome. Dirt fries they were awesome too. And elote corn on the cob also awesome.  Beer on tap a nice thing too 

Problem is, my hot dog came out looked great so I started eating it and I had one but left when the French fries canes ten minutes later. The French fries were scorching hot right out of the deep fryer which imo is good and bad. Good cuz it's cooked fresh but bad cuz my hot dog was gone and I have Fries that are too hot to eat right away. And then the corn came 5 min later. 

I recommend bringing the food out together not in pieces as their ready. Had they done that even if the fries were warm instead of hot it would've been a more enjoyable meal. 

All in all great place I'll be back."}
{"text":"Gross I wouldn't eat there ! I wanted a hot dog was so bad would of went to sonic . A lot of overpriced food i don't want . A waste of money and time ."}
{"text":"Really good but over priced.  I got two hot dogs, two corn elote, elote fries,  1 beer and a soft drink and churro ice cream for 55$.  Granted the food was great but I wouldn't think I'd end up spending that much for hot dogs."}
{"text":"Deep menu of amazing hot dog concoctions.  Simple ingredients assembled in imaginative, fun, FLAVORFUL ways.  Billed as LA Street Food, it's a culinary home run and a great way to shatter the family Friday night out rut."}
{"text":"Outstanding hot dogs. Great fries and other sides. Good beer selection. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! It's super delicious, fun, and unique. You won't find food like this anywhere else. I also love how friendly the staff was at helping me decide what to order considering it was my first time eating there. I recommend the garlic fries; they were just delicious. Not to mention that my hot dog was the best I've ever had in my life. The icing on the cake: I LOVE that this place is Los Angeles themed!! So cool! I will definitely be coming back for more :)"}
{"text":"If eating hotdogs is wrong I don't want to be right. 

This place is on the other side of town from where I live. I would drive here in rush hour traffic just to eat a snack. But F that cuz Im here so give me a hot dog and some fries. This sh*t is ridiculously good. Like \"street food\" shouldn't taste this good. But it does. So here I am. 

I have been here a few times and its always super good. 

If you are hungry but don't know what you want to eat come here immediately. You'll find something that will hit the spot. 

Good music playing. Loud enough to hear it but still have a conversation. 

My biggest problem with this place is choosing what I want to eat because it all looks so good. Check it."}
{"text":"Delicious food and even better service! I get the same thing every time-the house dog with salt and pepper fries. The atmosphere is great--from the friendly staff to the awesome music. Just beware of what time you go. If you go later on the weekends it's hard to find a table, but it is still worth the wait!"}
{"text":"These are the best hotdogs!! If you are in Las Vegas you must try you will not be disappointed my favorite was the dirty chili dog and the elote fries ! I will definitely be coming back before I head back home ."}
{"text":"Delicious! Green dog was great. Churro with horchata ice cream unbelievable. Just great food and great service. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  Worst location for such a cool spot with delicious food!   After seeing the sign for this place for months we finally decided to go check it out.  We had the dirty dog, salt & pepper fires, and a fried Twinkie all of which was full of flavor.  We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This place is fire  and it's such a comfortable place to be and the horchata Ice cream is great I personally liked the patty melt dog and the dirty chili dog but anyways go here it's worth it, if it ain't with ya girl bring the boys"}
{"text":"I had the House Dog and it was really good. I will definitely come here again when I'm craving a hot dog. I didn't dine in but it looks like a fun place. Good music and ambiance. Would be good for early 20s people to hang out for sure."}
{"text":"This is my fav go to spot! I love it here! Not only do they have great food they also have great customer service!"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious and everything is made in house. Will definitely be coming back time and times again!"}
{"text":"Dirt Dog il cibo è delizioso !!!!!! Io e mio marito abbiamo mangiato qui. E lascia che ti dica che il cibo è delizioso. C'era una ragazza che ha attirato la nostra attenzione. Stava andando e venendo e andando e venendo. era l'unica che avremmo potuto vedere di più se si trattava di controllare gli ospiti o semplicemente di distribuire i menu o il cibo. Mio marito mi ha chiesto di chiederle il nome. così ho fatto quando è venuta a controllarci se avevamo bisogno di qualcosa. Devo dire che amo questa ragazza il suo nome è maria. Dirt Dog non è solo il tuo cibo delizioso, ma il servizio clienti è fantastico !!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere for the restaurant is super chill. It has a lot of sitting and its set up like a \"diner\". The service there was great and they were super attentive. The cashier went through the whole menu with us when we told him that we had never been there. The food came out super quickly as well. They have hot dogs, fries, and tacos. We only got the tacos and fries though. 

Elote Fries: The fries were crispy and golden. They put a lot of cheese on the top and there was corn and bacon mixed in with the fries. The fries were decent, but I probably wouldn't order them again. 

The House dog and dirty chili dog: All the hot dogs come wrapped in bacon, which adds a lot of flavor.  Overall, the hot dogs were okay. Definitely not the best hot dog I have ever eat, but it wasn't bad. A bit overpriced for one hot dog though."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place! All the great pictures on Instagram and reviews make it it look so tasty! Portions are smaller than pictured. We tried the Dirty Fries and they could of used more chili and cheese and they were a bit on the salty side but, taste great! The hot dogs are delicious. I also ordered the Corn Mesquite and was a bit unsatisfied, the cup was literally filled half way, flavor was great though.....but for the price they could have filled the cup (just like pictured on the menu and what you see on IG). Place itself is nice, clean and spacious. Prices could be either lower or portions could be a bit more fuller/bigger. 

All aside, great place and great flavors!"}
{"text":"The vibe inside is pretty cool, but the food itself might be a little over hyped. My family & I still enjoyed our \"dogs\" but we expected a little more out of them. Corn was delicious though! We went last night, Sunday around 7:30ish & it was a long wait to order. There was only 1 girl taking orders & she was going back & forth with the iPads taking different orders for customers. Our table was never cleaned, so we picked up after the last customer & grabbed a few napkins to get rid of the crumbs & stuff. Bummer. We drove about 30 mins to try this place out, so I'm not sure about a second time. 4 stars because we didn't horribly dislike the food. It was still very filling."}
{"text":"First of all when I walk in a place and can't even talk to the person next to me because the horrible music is disgustingly loud, I'm likely to walk out. Then after looking over the menu and seeing the prices are more than shown here, strike 2.
2 dogs, a corn that was blah, kids meal and we drank water... For $30... No way
Can't recommend this joint at all"}
{"text":"Come here once a week. Love this place, gotta try the elote dog  it's a secret menu item. **please add micheladas to the menu***"}
{"text":"Their hot dogs and sides are the best things I've ever tasted. I had a Chili Dog on a buttered toast and Elote fries. I couldn't get enough of either of them. Their service was very speedy and a kitchen staff came out to check on the quality of food. I always appreciate restaurants that care for customers feedback to improve. Will go back many times."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant experience! Staff is very friendly and attentive. The red dog was delicious but extremely spicy. The dirty fries were also good a bit spicy not bad. Can't wait to come back when they have beer! Next week I'll be back for beer tasting."}
{"text":"Our first time here. My boyfriend saw the ad on Facebook and he knows how much I love elotes, so we had to try it out. We have been living in Vegas for almost a year now and are still trying out new places. This place was amazing. Not only the food, but the environment. It's urban and the music is great! Makes me feel like home. (We're from Denver, CO and we are so used to the urban cultures and local restaurants). Anyway, we shared the Al Pastor fries, dirty equite, the mutt dog and the chili dog. All were amazing and we were so full by the time we got done. We are going to have to go back again to try other stuff on the menu. I loved the mutt dog because it was wrapped in bacon. Delish!"}
{"text":"went in for late lunch, very interesting menu, very nice order taker at the front. the food, cold and blah, the garlic fries were old, garlic was dried up, had the dirty corn, was ok, lacked the flavor expected from menu. the hot dog, ok, costco has more flavor."}
{"text":"I wanted to try EVERYTHING! I eventually landed on trying the Elote Dog with the lobster bun and OMG. Heaven! Who knew corn could go on a hot dog? My fiancé tried the Dirty Chili dog and thoroughly enjoyed it. We shared the Filthy Fries and were disappointed by how full we were! We wanted to try the desserts too. This definitely won't be the last time we go here though so we have plenty of time to try everything  The people were super friendly. The atmosphere and music is super cool. Definitely recommend going here if you don't mind getting a little dirty"}
{"text":"Definitey an experience! One of the better Hot dog Eateries here in Vegas.

Been wanting to try this place out for a while and finally got the chance this afternoon. The restaurant itself is a bit hidden if you're not familiar with the side of town. My sister and I drove all the way down from North Vegas to check this place off of our list. Smaller place, beers on draft, but they don't just have hot dogs. Their menu includes Tacos and \"Taco Fries\". I ordered their Brown Dog which had a sweet teriyaki sauce and a sesame aioli with onions, bell peppers and bacon bits. One added bonus is you get to choose the type of bread your jot dog goes on. If you're a fan of anything teriyaki this is your hot dog. Their dirty fries are dusted with chili límon and are addictive. My sister ordered the Patty Melt Dog and said I had to try it when we return. We were both pretty hungry, so there wasn't much sharing. 

Service was nice and very polite. Our food came out quick. I noticed a stack of board games by the bar. Great place to just hang out with some friends have a snack and some laughs."}
{"text":"Favorite hot dog place in Vegas! Food is great and the servers are friendly. Lunch does get busy especially when the neighbor high school gets out. My favorite is the Elote Dog."}
{"text":"So we went here because my bro was craving hotdogs \"no homo\". But once we got in, food wa fast, service was the shit, they gave us free beer, and we played battle ship I even had their hottest hot sauce which was chilling in the back and baby I tell you, devil's blood is in me. But anyway, all the ladies we're great and I hope everyone comes out to enjoy. They're super friendly, super chill and fun to joke with. Please come they cuz they are down AF. DABA DABA DAB!!!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place ordered the veggie dog and dirty corn in a cup. Employees are very nice and helpful. Had a great experience will be back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this spot for lunch since I was in the Blue Diamond area. A small little restaurant in the edge of a business complex just east of rainbow, it's bigger on the inside than it looks. Once you step in, you walk right up to the register and the menus are to your immediate right and to the left of the door. They have a photo for every menu item that gives you a visual of what you're ordering (might I add that the food really does come out like the photo). They play 90's hip-hop and R&B on the radio, and you can still hear yourself over the music. Three TV's are tuned to various sports and the artwork is all centered around, obviously, Los Angeles and its culture.


Since it's my first time here, I asked the cashier for reccomendations. She helped me decide on the Elote dog and Filthy fries. 

I ordered the dog on Texas toast. The buttered bread holds the toppings on as well as it can (I see why they call it an extra dirty dog). The fries are made to order and came out extra crispy. The chipotle aioli sauce and semi-spicy guac gave it a great kick and still kept me from running to the fountain for a refill.

While these items were plenty to eat, I was curious about the street tacos and decided to try an Al Pastor and Vegan taco. A little underwhelming in size, but at such a low price point it's still worth it. I'm conflicted here. The vegan taco was good, tortillas were heated perfectly and the toppings were plentiful. Well executed. Now, on the other hand the al pastor taco was a bit disappointing. The meat was seasoned very well, but the tortilla was overcooked and too rough; I could not enjoy this taco as much as I'd hoped.

Despite a stale tortilla, overall experience was great, the employees were helpful and prompt in their service, plus managed to keep the place very clean. The food was well worth the price and the ambience was welcoming. I'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"that i might would have considered 3/4 months ago when i initially wrote the review instead this is a new year w/ new restaurants. i wouldn't dare drive from las vegas speedway to south rainbow again ... fool me once shame on me fool me twice well"}
{"text":"Good price and good food!!! Will come back for more  everything is perfect for me. The only thing that bothers me is the loudness of their music...please volume down lol!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch, wow, great dogs and the staff are really friendly.  I'll definitely visit again"}
{"text":"It was just ok. We went there just to try their corn, and they've been out both times we've gone. I had the green dog and my husband had the house dog. The house dog was better tasting, but they were both really dry. It looks nice when it comes to you, but the sauce is more decorative and soaks into the bun so fast that a few bites in, it just tastes like a dry hotdog with an occasional onion. The people behind the counter were very nice both times, though."}
{"text":"This place has personality, good music and great food! The staff is super friendly and so down to earth. They have board games and the overall experience was great! The ranchero dog was bomb AF. Definitely coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Wonderful service...I had Mutt dog... Hubby had the Dirty Chili Cheese Dog and we shared the garlic fries... Excellent!  Will be back"}
{"text":"The House Dog is good, simple menu, place is clean, pretty laid back and I love that music they play is straight 90's Rap... like Tupac, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Snoop, and etc.... 
Heads up! If you gonna bring your kids beware that music they play is not filtered"}
{"text":"By far one of the coolest places in I've been too. The artwork is awesome, the staff is extremely nice, and the food was good as well. I tried their carne Asada tacos, elote dog, and chili fries. I wasn't a fan of the aioli sauce on fries but I don't care for that sauce anyways. Other than that the phone was delicious."}
{"text":"In case you're wondering if it's possible to ruin a bacon wrapped hotdog, it is.

I had such high hopes for DirtDog. I was introduced to this establishment by some friends on Facebook. I don't think I can put in to words the excitement I felt. My inner fat boy was doing summer salts. My in-person experience left very little to be desired.

To start, the parking lot is eerily dark and extremely small. The proprietors of this establishment should really consider buying the land adjacent to this location to expand the parking lot or, at the least, put some lights in the parking lot. It's nearly pitch black out there and even as one that has good eyes, it is hard to see.

Inside, I was impressed. The layout was nice and chill. I was surprised by the hip-hop influence in everything from the music selection to the art work on the walls. Someone is a huge 2Pac fan; I loved it. The tables are plentiful and the dining area is spacious. Folks weren't on top of each other, but it still felt intimate.

My partner and I ordered our food with unfettered excitement. I don't remember the name of what I had, but I recall getting the lobster bun. That part was absolutely delicious. It was buttered on both sides and so soft. The taste of the dog itself was okay. Admittedly, I will say it was probably a poor selection. It had nacho cheese and bacon bits on it, but the dog wasn't very big and I found myself still hungry. This would've been okay had I not spent so much for the experience.

I also ordered the loaded fries that guacamole on them and that was terrible. The guac was waaaaay to smooth and creamy, so much so that it seemed like a guacamole puree. That added a taste that completely ruined the rest of the fries and I ended up throwing them away.

I would go back to try something else. I am hopeful that I'd have a better experience next time, if I choose a different menu item and stick to the basic fries."}
{"text":"We met a Local in Las Vegas Nevada who highly recommend trying dirt dog. Unique in flavorful toppings on hotdogs/fries/tacos. 
Extremely reasonable prices.hotdogs are appr $6/7 And The tacos are only $2.00 (andare literally piled high with toppings.) I attached a photo of the menu. I had a brown dog which was teriyaki and sesame aioli -Yum
The husband had the extra dirty dog- loaded with chili ( mild) bacon and melted cheddar cheese. And he loved every bite! 
     Can't wait for another trip to Vegas. We will definitely go back and try another flavor. We also tried the ice cream but we didn't have enough time to take a picture because we ate it!
GOD JOB .....putting a unique twist to Hotdogs!!!!!!
Super nice staffgreat food a excellent prices all = WINNER! 
Ps: by 1:30pm---prepare to be in a line.....call ahead or pre order on line!"}
{"text":"BOMB. BOMB. BOMB. Get you some elote and a red dog. Oh and elote fries. And the elote dog. Oh and chili cheese fries. You know what? Save yourself some time and order literally everything on the menu. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Great services.

Green dog and dirt corn. Awesome. Nice street food. Juice was good too."}
{"text":"Worth the drive off the strip. Easily one of the best hotdogs my wife and I have ever had. Must try it on the lobster roll."}
{"text":"I ordered the Green Dog and it was perfect, what was the best thing though was definitely the Garlic Fries... and make sure you get the dipping sauce it comes with it... it makes it even better."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place since they opened. We finally had the chance and it was packed! I ordered the dirty corn and the house dog and the hub ordered the green dog and dirty fries. The fries, corn and green dog was delicious but the house dog didn't deliver. I didn't even finish it, the ketchup, mustard and mayo(not listed on the menu in store but is shown online)overwhelmed the bacon thousand island sauce and peppers so I ordered a green dog and it was delicious. The parking is terrible and it could be kind of hard to find since it's in a crowded plaza and hidden in the very back. I think we'll definitely come back because there are plenty of options."}
{"text":"The dirty corn and filthy fries are great!! The hot dogs are delicious and messy,  so my only suggestion is to get napkins dispensers for the tables, and bigger water glasses for those not getting sodas. My wife felt like she was drinking out of a Dixie cup."}
{"text":"Came in after work feening for some hot dogs. This place definitely comes thru with the street dog flavor. Service was dope. Cashiers are cool.

I ate the elote dog, and the red dog. Red dog was slightly sweet with a nice spicy flavor. Hot dog texture was perfect, and bun wasn't oily. Thumbs up here. The elote dog was tangy, sweet, and very savory. I also sampled the mutt dog and the dirty chilli dog. Out of the four, my favorite so far is the chilli dog. Fries came out crisp and a little oily at the bottom. They were lightly salted as well. Garlic fries use minced garlic and not powder. You get really nice bites.  Super worth.

If you need to eat hot dogs, this is a dope spot.

Will eat again!!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious and their menu was so unique. Prepare for a long line but once you place your order it does come out fast and definitely worth the wait. The staff was very friendly and accommodating for being so busy."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after a friend of ours gave it two thumbs up! I really like the atmosphere nice place to enjoy a simple yet delicious meal. We had the House Dog, Brown Dog and Green Dog...they were all amazing. Very very flavorful and the buns were perfectly toasted (lobster bun was the best). The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the fries could have been better. The fries themselves were good, perfectly fried but if you are going to sale them as specific flavors, they better all taste different. We ordered the dirty, garlic and sea salt and pepper..they all tasted exactly the same. Other than that difinately a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal! Hands down the best hot dog place in Vegas! Great friendly staff, quick service, excellent presentation and absolutely amazing food! This is definitely our new spot for a quick delicious meal! This place knows what they're doing."}
{"text":"I've wanted this concept in Hawaii for a decade! Great tasting dogs and sides as well. Great beer selection too."}
{"text":"I'm a little confused where all the 5 star ratings are coming from. Firstly, it took 15 minutes to get hot dogs + fries. Then, there was nothing at all impressive about the food. Just standard, not great, hot dogs. The toppings actually made them worse, in my opinion. Even the fries were subpar... How do you mess up fries with garlic on them. I've had dozens of varieties of garlic fries and have never once had to complain about them. Sorry, but I just can't recommend this place. Would rather grill up my own dogs and have them plain as can be...plus save $20"}
{"text":"Finally was able to check out Dirt Dog because my boyfriend loves it. He took me to the one on Rainbow and first thing was that the line was looong lol. So, to me that just means this place must be good. We waited for about 5-10 mins in line until we were next. I ordered the Dirty Chili Dog and it was sooo good. We also ordered the Dirty Fries, the seasoning was delicious! The service was ok too, bit all in all, I was very satisfied. I will definitely come back, but try their tacos :)."}
{"text":"I have visited this place a few times when they first opened, but had not visited in over 6 months. Their food is unique and takes you out of the same ol hot dog type food. They are creative with their food and you could eat there often and not burn out because of all the choices they offer. 

We have tried a few of their hot dogs, our favorites being the patty melt, mutt dog and the dirt chili dog. Besides the hot dogs their dirty esquite, garlic fries and churro's are also favs. 

They have a friendly staff, and when ordering they are always patient no matter how long the line is. When we visited today, they were packed with a steady flow of people lined up out the door and the service was still top notch, they seemed to thrive in the high paced environment.

With the amount of business they get, they may need to invest in more space, as there were no tables available to eat so you had to keep an eye out to rush to a table once it opened."}
{"text":"1st time here yesterday and though there were no one else in the restaurant, the food and service was above par. The restaurant is spacious and clean, and there's a good amount of selection on the menu. I ordered the \"house\" dog aka \"the dirt dog\" which consisted of a beef dog wrapped in bacon (all their dogs are which is awesome!) topped with grilled onions and peppers cooked in thousand island sauce, letchu, mayo, mustard, and bacon bits! As far as the bun, you have a choice of 3, I chose the Portuguese which is a \"sweeter\" bun and the bun is laced with a green chile spread. Overall, it was a delicious dog! Probably one of the best I've had in a while. My friend ordered the \"red\" dog which was spicier -- and for those who aren't too used to spice, it definitely has a kick! My lips were burning a bit after tasting hers! Dirt dog is definitely a good spot to grab a quick and satisfying bite, so glad they brought one over from LA to Las Vegas. Also, shoutout to one of the chef's Cameron! Since business was a little slow when I went, he hooked it up with some free samples that weren't on the menu! From onion rings, to jalapeño poppers, and his own secret sauce!"}
{"text":"The food was exactly what I expected, lives up to the hype. I had the chilly dog and the asada fries. My food was great, unfortunately I can't say the same about my kids chicken nuggets. They were dry and tasteless, that was the only disappointing part."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Great atmosphere with a chill vibe, but the food was just phenomenal! We tried the brown dog, house dog and the filthy fries! So great, definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This place was very interesting!!! Line out the door when we arrived. The menu was big enough to preview while we were in line. The cashier was extremely nice great customer service gave us his suggestions of what was the best thing on the menu. Once we ordered our food we sat down and enjoyed the atmosphere of this place. The servers were really nice and fast. I ended up getting the tinga fries and my husband got the chili dog everything was extremely delicious will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hello there! So I came in about 2 days ago I believe it was Tuesday the 19th. I did a phone order at around 445pm. I was only 10 mins away. When I got there it was about 545 about an hour difference from my phone order! I ordered 4 hot dogs 2 fries and a dessert as well. When I got there 2 names stood out Nicole and Jayden. Jayden was the one who took my pick up order at the register. My food was supper cold and I was willing to take it and go. There was a bunch of traffic and and accident so my 10 mins turns into and hr. Nicole then came to me and said she apologizes for what happen and offered to have ALL OF MY FOOD REMADE do to the circumstances! I waited only about an additional literally about 5 mins and all my food was done and made fresh (HOT). Nicole sat at the register while redoing everything and talking with me ay the same time about your company and how she loves it. Nicole and Jayden both had impeccable service. I will defiantly be coming back. She also very knowledgeable on her beers as I work at BJ's and am the bartender to have someone like her be as knowelgebale is a plus in my book. Keep up the good work girls and DIRT DOG. your food was well with the extra 5 mins wait."}
{"text":"Love the hot dogs... it's really juicy! I ordered the red dog and the garlic fries! The red dog is really good!!! The fries was ok not too garlicky for me. The place is really cool the designs on the wall are nice so colorful, the place is really clean. Staff are really nice greets u soon as u get in... I will definitely be back to try the other food they have to offer. O"}
{"text":"My Las Vegas friend told me to check this place out. We got off the plane,  got our rental car and drove straight here! We ordered the Elote dog and the Brown dog and shared an order of garlic fries.  Fast service,  nice clean and open eating area with bumping music!  Everything was fresh and incredibly flavorful! Would recommend to anyone for something a little different!"}
{"text":"So..... not what I expected !! The hot dog was very good but a very disappointing menu and selection !!! I really thought there would have been more to choose from and it was a pricey for what you get !!

The place was very clean although one of the workers walking through the dining  room had a bag in his hand and it was leaking something!!

My hot dog was very good but my wife's cheese on the dog was over cooked!! 

I would expand the menu for all ......"}
{"text":"This place is really good, however I think a bit overpriced on the food options, I do love the beer selection. the vibe there is ok, I would return again."}
{"text":"This place was DELICIOUS!!! The food was the perfect serving, the hot dog is beef and amazing and their corn side was pure perfection. I also indulged in their dessert, horchata ice cream with a freshly made churro...TO. DIE. FOR!
This place is a must."}
{"text":"So, it's really hard for me to write this review as the food was delicious but sitting in line for 45 minutes for them to take my order in for my food to be ready in five minutes and watch the whole restaurant be empty due to lack of management in the facility is where this review comes in. Stood in line for 45 minutes watch the whole restaurant clear out the front door was held open the whole time so the inside of the restaurant became hotter to the point where I couldn't even sit and stay and enjoy my food and beer. I watched 4 other employees pace back and forth while a 2nd computer was available the whole time to clear the line that was out the front door and around the building. I watched as probably $1000.00 of business walked away after having to wait so long (based off my tab for 2 hot dogs, 2 fries, and a cold beer). Like I said the house dog and filthy fries I had and the dirty chili dog and fries my other half had were Really good, I have been looking forward to coming to this place since moving out here, but after watching this shit show take place, my beer getting hot , and not being able to finish or enjoy my food because the front door being open for over an hour and the restaurant heating up (mind you it's a cool 105 today) I'm very unhappy and dissatisfied. Again it's a shame I have to write this but the experience was one I had to write about"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect walking in there but it's such a cool environment! If you're a hot dog lover, this is the place to go. They have so many different twists on hot dogs, fries & deserts. They even offer tacos! I loved it & will definitely be going back. I gotta show EVERYONE this place
I must add, my 6 month old loved the elote fries!"}
{"text":"Great place! I had driven by it a few times and finally went in. I had family in town and we decided to see what it was about!! The food look good we tried a few of their signature dishes and we loved them. It's a family place where you can bro g the kids, play a few bored games and enjoy the time and food. It's also a good place for a group of friends to hang out!! I would definitely recommend it. I was pleasantly surprised!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I didn't try any dogs but I did have an elote and their horchata ice cream that comes with a churro and OMG it was so good! Totally going back to try a dirty dog next time"}
{"text":"I finally gave Dirt Dog a try and the hype is real. The dog I had was wrapped in bacon and topped with elote which I didn't expect to like but damn the combination of flavors tasted great. The dog was big and had nice flavor and the bun was slightly grilled in butter. I didn't care much for the al pastor tacos but the chicken tinga and asada were bomb af. The tinga was spicy and the flavors were good but the asada was the real winner for me I\"ll be back to plow through many more of those. The carne adasa nachos didn't last long at our table everybody really liked them the chips tasted so good. They serve beer here but I recommend the horchata. I wish I had room for some of the fried oreos but I'll have to save room next time."}
{"text":"Loved this place !!! The menu is awesome & the style & vibe of the restaurant is really unique & fun . I tried the elote dog & the deep fried Oreos which were both to die for . I'll definitely be returning soon to try the tacos & elotes . Also , they have a good variety of beers . Can't wait to go back & have some more deep fried Oreos ."}
{"text":"I was excited when I found this place down the street from our house because they serve veggie dogs and those can be hard to come by. What really sold me were all the other deliciously \"dirty\" options.

The Veggie Dog ( green style w/ Portuguese bun)
For lack of a better word.... it.. sucked.
The chimichuri was not chimichuri it was something that made the bun a light green color and kept it super dry.
I didn't mind the veggie dog itself, nice grill marks, but zero flavor. Just a soy tube. A little fat, salt/pepper can go a long way. 

* They offer 3 types of buns (which are all egg washed so NO VEGAN option) a regular white, a Portuguese (which was described as sweet but really should just be described as SUCKS)

I did want to add that the cook noticed that I wasn't really into my meal and offered to make me something new but by that time I was already full. I will absolutely give this place another shot... even if its just for their delicious mexican corn"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Fast service and super friendly staff!!! We will definitely be back again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"Dirt Dog LA has finally come to Vegas! Open now in the poppin' southwest area, Dirt Dog has a menu of bacon-wrapped street dogs, topped with peppers and onions and your choice of spreads and bun. Sides include street corn, dirty chips, garlic fries, and deep-fried desserts. 

My pick is the classic house dog, on a lobster bun. My guy preferred the Green Dog with chimmichurri sauce and the Portuguese bun. The street corn was delicious, but we'll have to come back for the garlic fries. Deep-fried Oreos are served with a side of cinnamon frosting for dipping for a sweet ending to your meal.

Staff were super friendly and checked on us constantly. Location is clean with an industrial vibe. Signage is a little hard to see from the street, so just know it's in the same plaza as Pho Annie. Follow them on social media for discounts and event info- they have a beer tasting coming up next week!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best hot dogs I have ever had ever! This place is absolutely delicious! Me and my girlfriend decided to try it and weren't disappointed at al! Well worth the wait, well worth the price! 10/10, will be going here again!"}
{"text":"If i could give this place a 1000 stars it wouldnt be enough from the best food to the welcoming staff to the art work of 2 pac this place is now my go to place every week. I go out alot and i have never wrote a review before but i had two zbout this place. I traveled 18 miles to try there food and its the best in vegas street corn was the best i ever had and the street tacos were to die for. The best hot dogs i ever had and im a hot dog freak so i know they were to die for. I recommend this place for youre whole family. Please make one by henderson thank you"}
{"text":"I was sooooo excited about this place, I definitely didn't think I'd be leaving a three star review. Let's start with the positive! Great music, fun vibe, my sons and I loved the games while we were waiting for our food! The food itself tasted great! All three of us loved it! Soooo.... this was our first time visiting. We took a minute to go over the menu, this seemed to immediately set a tone of annoyance with the girl at the counter. We did step aside so others (there weren't any) could order. When we finally decided my sons ordered first. With the first selection she asked what type of bun, my son asked what his options were, annoyed she recited them. Second son orders and again asks bun choices as he hadn't heard her. She is even more annoyed. I place my order and hand my card over to pay. She swipes it and literally flings it on the counter. Okay.... so, the same girl brings out our order of fries wayyyyyyy before the food arrives and simply drops them on the table. As for the dogs we ordered two house dogs and one ranchero. Again, they tasted great. Only the two house dogs were so different from one another they didn't even look like the same dog. One was clearly loaded up and the other had been skimped on. Why the inconsistency? I left feeling sad, and really don't know that I'll return."}
{"text":"I'm too lazy to do Yelp reviews but MAN! I left happy. Ordered the mutt dog, deep fried oreo and twinkies. The horchata whip cream was out of this world! *happy dance in my seat* I want to come back! My little slice of heaven. *sigh*"}
{"text":"Food-wise the place is a good solid 4 , fries were excellent, the Red Dog was spicy and tasty, the chili dogs were pretty flavorful also.  When I am in the mood for hot dogs I usually go to Steemie Weenie since it is more on my side of town, but this place will be a good alternative for when a change is needed."}
{"text":"Nice, clean restaurant. When you walk in there is barely any aroma of food which is nice because I hate walking out of a restaurant smelling like it. 

Menu- Simple, easy to read menu w/ pictures as reference. Wish they had more variety of hot dogs though. 

Service- Friendly. It's not really a restaurant style service. You just order when u walk in and sit down with your number & they bring you your food. 

Ordered the House dog on Lobster roll & Red dog on Portuguese roll and asked for the chili flakes on the side because it looks overwhelming in the photos. The house dog had a little bit too much sauce for my liking but overall it was a good hot dog. The bread made it even better because it was a little buttery! 

Sides- ordered the garlic fries that came with a garlic aioli. Wish there were more garlic on the fries though. The aioli was good. Very garlic-y 

Really wanted to try the horchata ice cream & churro but I was tooooo stuffed! Next time.

I would definitely come back to try the other hot dogs because it's not that pricey & down the road from my house."}
{"text":"I had the Green Dog. This is a cool place if you love hot dogs.  I had been getting my fix at Sonic's previously, but this place has Nathan's 5/1 dogs with all sorts of cool gourmet toppings and awesome that they have quite a bit of selection of beer on tap!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me we had to hit the spot definitely glad I listen to him the dogs are amazing chili cheese fries just as good. It's a definite must hit if you're on the south end of town service is good too."}
{"text":"If you want an LA dirty dog but in a cleaner, safer environment.. Come to Dirt Dog!

Our first time here.. Definitely hit the spot.

Simple menu (there's a secret menu, the cashier told me about it)

Great tasting food..

Reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Excellent service! First time here and we had the pleasure of meeting Shay (new employee) and Alex. They were absolutely wonderful and incredibly helpful. Alex gave us a rundown of the menu and the beer options, and was enthusiastic and friendly the entire time. We ordered the house dog, red dog, garlic fries, churros, and deep fried Oreos. Everything tasted amazing and was exactly as described. The churros were the best we ever had, as they're sweet and melt in your mouth. My favorite thing about this place, hands down, was the exceptional service. We felt immediately welcome and comfortable.  Will definitely be back again for our next hotdog fix."}
{"text":"It was soo good! I had the Elote fries! YESS!!! I will definitely be going back! So clean, and really friendly staff."}
{"text":"Store is really hip & plays awesome 80's/90's hip hop. Food was really good. Had the green dog w/o onions & peppers and the chili dog. Both were great. Also tried the dirty chips. Now let's talk about the elote (corn). It was so good! Worth the drive just for the corn. So messy (like 5 napkins) but amazing!"}
{"text":"I was excited to get to try this place out as a friend suggested it had great food. Even for vegetarians and vegans, which is hard to come by! 

Upon entering, you'll see this place has a very urban vibe to it. There's a corner of the wall that allows you to pin how far you drove to get there (all within the Las Vegas/Henderson valley, but it stops anywhere north of Charleston). Should extend the map to the ceiling! 

I ordered a vegan taco and their elote fries without the bacon bits for roughly $8 all together. 

It was delicious!! I thought $2 was expensive for 1 taco, especially once they finally served it to me because it was TINY. But it was all worth it at first bite. So flavorful, recommend trying it out. 

Their elote fries were really good too. Comes with a lot for $5.50 and I couldn't even finish it all. Put some in a box and finished it once I got home. 

Service was very fast and the cashier was super caring, ensuring each customer wasn't allergic to any of the ingredients in something they ordered (such as cilantro and citrus). 

Overall, great food, great service, and great atmosphere. Very satisfied! Would return much more quickly if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Love this place. Wish it was bigger inside but we work with it. Been there twice and loved it both times"}
{"text":"Today is the first day of this hot dog place.
There are a few choices, but they all looks great. I tried The House Dog, the bread that a little like a French roll is was toasted perfectly, the sausage was delicious with a just right spicy touch. 
This new restaurant is located on Rainbow , very close to Blue Diamond. 
It definitely worth a try. I will be back."}
{"text":"Dirt dog is a Mexican twist on hotdogs! They have a very simple menu and different varieties of bread which is the best part. My favorite was their sides, we got the Mexican corn and house chips which went really well with the hotdogs. They also have a good selection of draft beer. The place isn't ever really busy so it's nice to go anytime of day. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"THE HOUSE DOG in a LOBSTER BUN. Get the Sea Salt Fries with Garlic Ranch dip. Bomb.com
This place has such a good vibe when you walk in. They play good music (hip-hop) takes me back to California and my younger days. I love this place."}
{"text":"The feeling of the place is hip and trendy, order at the counter take a number and sit. Coming from southern California I'm picky on minor stuff like drinks their horchata is made from powder and almond milk. 

The food was good nothing amazing but not bad. The churro was incredible. I will probably will be back but I'm not jumping in the car to go there again anytime soon. 

Ps the kitchen didn't seem organized they took back our food a couple of times because the server noticed something was wrong or off. Good extra points for her!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here, and I fell in love with this place! The environment was really chill and laidback. The staff was really helpful and friendly too! My boyfriend, ordered the Brown Dog and I ordered the Green Dog and we split the garlic fries. According to my boyfriend, the fries were soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside. SUPER GOOD. The food was SO SO SO delicious. For dessert, we had fried oreos and the churros with a vanilla creamy dipping sauce. Not exactly sure what it was but, the dessert was amazing! Will love to come back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely unique...I can honest say I have never had elote fries or hot dogs but they are to die for! The atmosphere and the food is well worth the trip no matter where you live."}
{"text":"Came into this place because a buddy of mine recommended it. They have some of the most unique flavors for their dogs. The customer service was impeccable. Ryan was extremely knowledgeable about the food and very nice. He's real passionate about this place and it helped make my decision on what to get. 

I got the red dog and the green dog. Both of them were DELICIOUS. Chef Cam is a MASTER behind grill and the word out there about a secret menu has be real excited to go back."}
{"text":"We love the food and the atmosphere here. We have met the nicest people here. They carry board games that you can play at the tablr. Art work on the walls. Order at the counter and they bring you the food. The food is great. Both times we have been here its been on point.
The street corn comes in several different varieties and they have smothered fries of all kinds..we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Only ate here once, but will definitely be coming back. The hot dogs are delicious, fries come up a bit short compared to their dogs. But those arent the main attraction here. Beer selection is decent with great tasting beers on tap. Oh, and there's a secret menu"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Ate at Dirt Dog for the first time today, and while the hot dogs are fairly good, they're not anywhere near worth the $7 price tag. The service was painfully slow - and you order at a counter as you walk in. There was one other family in line and it took around 15 minutes for us to just place our order. Esquite was good, but again grossly overpriced, and the stupid expensive chili fries were soggy and bland. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Heard many good things, so we had to check it out ourselves. We drove about 30 min across town to get here and it was worth it! We ordered the elote dog, filthy fries, carne asada tacos, and the horchata ice cream. They use 100% beef hot dogs wrapped in bacon! It was all so good, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"they're fries are too salty and the elotes have no taste. overall the desserts and hot dogs are really good!"}
{"text":"I had the dog with the jalapeño jelly and peanut butter. Just because the person at the counter recommended it. So good."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is great but it's just overpriced. I can't justify paying 7$ for a hotdog and 5$ for French fries with how small the portions are... if you're looking for a small snack, then yes this place is for you. If you're looking to get full then I suggest somewhere else."}
{"text":"great vibe and customer service. very fun menu. also good options for vegans. i had the vegan tacos and vegan chorizo (soy) fries. i appreciate the art and music inside"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim one night, and have probably been back at least 1x a week since! (Mainly because my boyfriend is obsessed)

He gets the Brown dog, carne asada fries, and deep fried oreos.. every.. time.. 

So far I have tried: carne asada tacos, soyrizo tacos, the green dog, carne asada fries, the churro, horchata ice cream, and the deep fried oreos! All were amazing, but my go-to probably has to be the carne asada fries. 

The servers are attentive and friendly. They get extremely busy, but still keep the place very clean. The only reason for 4 stars is because there have been 2 or 3 occasions where they have gotten our order wrong. Besides that, it's great!"}
{"text":"Eh.... just ok... we were excited to go to Dirt Dog! Heard good things about it.... got there today about 1:30, line was wrapped around....Thought, Good sign! I ordered the chili dog as it came...garlic and peppers were burnt little pieces sprinkled over the burnt \"homemade chili\". Yuck.. Hot dog was crisp when you bit into it which I liked but I never tasted nor saw any cheese.  Hubs got the chimmichurry and avocado dog. He did not finish it... just was not good... we also had the garlic fries, which we normally love but, not these... Way too much garlic and we love garlic! Figi water ordered and on menu but was given Smart Water.... all in all...doubt we would return...."}
{"text":"This is the second visit I have made to this restaurant.  Wonderful food, fabulous service and an all-around pleasant atmosphere.  Keep up the good work in making the customers feel appreciated and for the great food!"}
{"text":"Solid four stars for the solid solid flavors here. My boyfriend and I came here because we've been having ridiculous pregnant woman cravings for elote. Apparently Dirt Dog hails from LA--but I only heard about it after moving out of LA. LOL! It's located in the very corner of a random plaza, so use your GPS like everyone else has said.

Shoutout to the waitress who was doing everything tonight: taking orders, bringing plates out, bussing tables. She was super friendly and gave us a quick run through of the menu. According to her, the house dog and green dog were their most popular dishes. So we got those and the dirty esquite, which is basically elote in a cup. The house dog was so flavorful--the sauce was so bomb. The green dog was also great and a little more tart, but house dog was my favorite. I do wish their dogs would have a crispy bite to them like the ones at Top Dog in Berkeley, CA. The esquite was actually just ok; the cheese was pretty monotonous, so I added some tapatio to change things up.

I took off a star because it's way too pricey for a fancy hot dog. This place is cool and I can see myself coming back when I have a hankering for fancy hot dogs (who knew that could even be a thing lol)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Red Dog and Carne Asada fries. The hot dog was really good :)!! However the carne asada fries had burn meat (see picture) and no guac sauce. A bit disappointing."}
{"text":"First time coming here with some co workers. Couldn't ask for better food, atmosphere or soundtrack. If your on the southwest side of vegas this is a must try"}
{"text":"This place is awesome great dogs. Has a California feel. Great service and they have games to play while you eat"}
{"text":"This is not the same place I've been to several times before. Granted it was busier than I have ever seen them but most people that came in after me ate and left by the time I got my food which was just two kids meals and one patty melt dog. And then when I finally did get my food it was absolutely nothing like the first few times I had been here. The dogs then were piled with stuff and were delicious. This one had about three fries and a tiny bit of cheese sauce on it. Not gonna come back here again"}
{"text":"First time eating here. I saw they have a mexican corn thats why I decided to try this place. I love their mexican corn. Hotdog is pretty good too. Staff is friendly and constantly checks on everyone. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Seriously, I'm never disappointed when I come here! Cameron is seriously the BEST!! I absolutely love his energy every time I go in there he really just makes the experience that much more incredible!!! And well, the food is just as GREAT!!!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Hanging out at Dirt Dog for dinner. Great hot dogs  and good  service. Love  the hot dogs here."}
{"text":"A pretty decent place! Been there twice. First time by myself, second time brought a friend. The food definitely tastes good, but the portions are small, if you get just one hot dog, you'll leave hungry. A couple things I have to mention about this place that made it into 4 star instead of 5. 
First of all, there is no menu at the table, the setup is more like McDonald's. But the problem is that people are very indecisive. It makes the wait extremely long, for example, last night, I had to wait about 15 minutes for just 2 people in front of me to order.. They were standing there, looking at the menu and couldn't decide what they wanted. This could be easily solved if there were either more cashiers (instead of just one), or even better, let people sit at a table and give them a menu so they can sit there as long as they want until they decide. This way others won't have to wait so long. Second thing is the restroom. The place can get pretty busy, the place serves beer and plays music. This means that people might want to stick around a little longer, but the restroom is only for one person at a time. This can get very uncomfortable. You have to wait even if you just want to go wash your hands. Otherwise it's a very nice place, cozy set up. Food doesn't take too long to prepare. I recommend"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Had lunch here with my husband and daughter. The esquite was phenomenal!! The hot dogs were as well....so if you've ever been clubbing in L.A. you know that there are always street vendors grilling up bacon wrapped hotdogs with the fixings.....well Dirt Dog has captured that amazing taste and they taste even better with being intoxicated  
The horchata ice cream was the perfect sweet treat too. Definitely going back to Dirt Dog!!"}
{"text":"Super legit! 

Just noticed this place popped up on Yelp nearby search. Saw the photos and decided to have a go. Actually my wife saw the \"dirty corn\" and said were going. We ordered 2 dirty corn and a brown and green dog. Everything was amazing. The actual hot dogs were very high quality as were all the ingredients. 100% we are coming back soon to try more of the menu. 

Just went back about a month after the first visit. Seriously this place is no joke. For real stop by and check this place out. I had the green dog again and a bowl of corn. Wifey had the brown dog. Both were awesome. Do yourself a favor and make a stop here."}
{"text":"To me, this was just an ordinary hot dog place. They use Nathan's hot dogs and add their own toppings to it. I had gotten the popular house dog and the boyfriend got the green dog. It was seriously nothing real FANTASTIC about it. We also got the garlic fries but they weren't even garlicky. The garlic didn't really stick to the fries so it just tasted like normal fries. We did notice that they had deep fried Twinkies, deep fried Oreos, horchata ice cream, and churro!! But we didn't opt for it bc the food didn't impress us. Not sure if we'd ever come here again."}
{"text":"Great food but didn't like the gangster rap. Wouldn't bring my kids here because of it."}
{"text":"This place came up on our Facebook and since it's around the corner from us we figured...why not?! Well I'm glad we did.  We are both PICKY eaters and had no trouble finding something we liked and asking for ingredient to be left off. They did forget to leave off the onions on one order and were quick to remake.  Never thought grilled corn would be so good on a hot dog. Delish!!!!  Even better than the food was the music! As we were leaving one of the workers apologized again for the mistake on the dog. Every worker we came in contact was extremely friendly and courteous. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas last week and I was really excited to try this place. What caught my attention about this place is that it had really good reviews. The pictures of the food looked so delicious. I finally got to try it. My boyfriend and I ordered the elote dog and chili fries. Everything tasted excellent! The hot dog was nice and juicy. The portion is huge. I'd highly recommend everyone to check this place out if you're in Vegas. My boyfriend and I truly enjoyed this place! 

However, the only thing that's keeping me from giving this place a 5 star, is that we found hair in our chili fries. I'm not the type of person to make a big deal about hair in my food. I would usually just pick it out and not eat the part of my food that the hair touched. But this time it wasn't just one strand of hair. It was two or three long strands. It was mixed in with the chili.. I just couldn't. To be honest, I lost my appetite. I didn't even bother trying to pull it out because I was just kind of disgusted actually.. we brought it back to the workers and they gave us a full refund of the meal. Which was really nice of them to do and I really appreciated that. While we were standing there waiting for the worker to do what they needed to, my boyfriend overheard a manager (I'd assume she was a manager) talking to the cashier lady that she needed to talk to her about \"this.\" So this made us wonder if the hair issue happens often here. I'd suggest for the management of this place to make the workers wear a hairnet in order to prevent this issue from occurring again."}
{"text":"Elotes! Awesome dogs, garlic fries and horchata churro ice cream! Excellent service! Originally from Los Angeles, this place has that LA vibe, complete with South LA music, a little Snoop Dog, Tupac and Cube. There are several types of buns you can choose from for your dog, along with different toppings. I went with the toasted pretzel bun. We had to share the fries, the hot dogs are big! The corn came in a cup, (or you can have the traditional cob) and it had a mixture of butter, spices and cheese. Very delicious! I will be back! Nom!"}
{"text":"Well the hot dogs are good. If you want to wait 30-45 mins for a hot dog. It is a Friday night at 700 we got here and half of our party got their food and already finished. 

They said they aren't used to this many people. The restaurant isn't even half full. 

I don't understand."}
{"text":"Misleading advertisement! I saw the video on Facebook which they put melted cheese on the top of the hotdog. It was the only reason that I wanted to try it. We ordered two  Dirty Chili Hotdogs. They both came with a few pieces of shredded cheddar cheese. ( literally only a few pieces). When I asked the cashier girl, why there is no melted cheese on the top, she said it doesn't come with melted cheese. Weird! If you check the menu it says clearly \"Melted Bacon Cheddar\". And after that I checked their website and the photos obviously show that they use melted cheese on this item. I don't know why they didn't use on ours. They were lazy maybe? 
Top photo is my hotdog. Bottom left is the menu and bottom right how they advertise it."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this place so my cute little and myself ventured out for a secret get away to partake in an evening of forbidden food  Oh my, talk about an indulgence that didn't disappoint! We shared our meal because we wanted to have room for dessert once we read the menu! Our dog and fries were perfection and we chased it with a Mexican bottled coke! But for us the dessert was everything and more! Homemade churro and horchata ice cream. Can you say foodgasm!?!"}
{"text":"If you love hot dog you MUST try this place out.  Their  hot dogs are just so damn good.  I try something new each time and have never been disappointed.  They also added tacos to their menu which are pretty good. Not anything over the top, but then again, I'm not too picky with tacos.  If you're just looking to chill, vibe and eat something good go check this place out.  Lines get long but trust me, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Dirt Dog has some bomb elote fries and a pretty good selection of beer. The workers are all nice but couldn't give this place 5 stars. Unfortunately, the night I was here, our food arrived quicker than the beer. The line took about 15 minutes and our beers took another 20, probably were forgotten about. 

I think it's growing quicker than the employees can handle."}
{"text":"Best hotdog in town! You definitely want to sample Elote Dog and The Red Dog to start! Add Elote fries or Filthy Fries and you are good! Make sure to save room for desert!This place has a good vibe and very hip! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sadly I gotta lower my rating...:( 

The ambiance looked great. It looked like that in between my visits that they had updated alot of stuff. Tables and the bar area were awesome. Very clean and very open. Loved the layout but it was a tad cold as in not temperature cold but not very inviting...4/5

Service was still off... Maybe I keep on getting them on off times. I entered and looked at the menu boards...I was greeted right away by a lady in the kitchen but the guy that was taking the order was busy doing something... I'm not sure what but there were only 2 tables and they already had their food. I waited a bit and he came and took my order. (3/5) the only reason why I have him a 3 is because he remembered that I asked for extra lime wedges and brought them out.

Food was sadly where they missed it this time. They are known for their hot dog wrapped bacon. Well this time the bacon was chewy and not crisp and no char at all. The lobster roll was toasted almost too dark but sadly the bacon was white since it was mainly fat and limp and just soggy and stringy. The hot dog had no char which added so much for to my dog last time. I got the mutt and the toppings were actually better then last time but the main part... The hot dog wrapped bacon was soooooo sad. :( And I waited almost 15 minutes for this dog. I understand that they are trying for quality over quantity...I get that and respect that... But when I wait 15 minutes and the dog and the bacon is soggy and limp.... The respect goes out the door and I have to wonder what the heck were they doing back there????? (1/5)

The dirty Esquite was the best thing I had today.  It was pretty good but even with all the kernels that get stuck in between my teeth...I stick with the dirty corn... It was good but it had too much crema for my taste it was on the verge of being too creamy. The corn still had great texture which was very glad for. (4/5)

Will I be back.... Maybe... They are very close to me but the hot dog was such a disappointment today. If I do come back it might just be for the corn... Not sure if I want to try the bacon wrapped dogs again with it being so inconsistent. :("}
{"text":"First time, had the dirty dog (secret menu) and green dog, dirty corn and a stone ipa. Everything is pretty solid. Great flavors and very filling. Will try again!!"}
{"text":"Great concept and the staff were nice. I got the hotdog with the red and green sauce mixed together. It had a good spice to it and was pretty good. I love mexican corn so I split one with my gf, Pretty much what I expected it to be, mmmmmm. They have a large selection of hot sauces and have tvs that were showing college hoops."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and great service! The cook even brought out fried orios for the kids was really nice of them! Will definitely come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"First the staff is nice... Well I should say the cook/chef in the back was very cool. 

The bun was great and the hotdog was great . For 5.95??? Not that good. Now- if it came with fries and drink for say... $9.99 then fine. Still pricey but totally doable. Also didn't see any options for a plain dog w/just mustard or catsup..They should have that.

I don't drink beer. But if I did, $8 for a beer is higher then at Dodger stadium. Would love to see there sales for beer. I would bet a lot of money is not so good. With this location and in this town... Very few are going to pay. $8 for a beer. 

Also love it's open until 11pm... But have a \"happy hour\" say 9pm to 11:00pm... Half off... You would kill it ....

The fried Oreo cookie . Is good. I mean Oreo cookies are one of the best things ever created... So it is almost impossible to mess up an Oreo...But only giving 2... Not so good. Dipping sauce is great. But I LOVE OREO and would never get this desert again.

Who doesn't like a churro? Would have been A LOT BETTER if it was twice the size and 1/10 the cinnamon sugar.

Overall the space is way to big and just doesn't fit the hot dog vibe. Also I love Tupac ... But completely out of place and threw the vibe off.

I hope he has free rent as the burger place that was there before had to move as it's the single worst location on Rainbow.

Another terrible thing......When u pay with debit or credit they turn the pad towards you (cool)  and first you must decide what % of tip to leave...5,10,15 or 20%. (NOT COOL)
This is BEFORE YOU EVER GET FOOD OR SERVICE!! 

Also they would like you just to leave your mess at the table and there are no garbage cans. Ok that's fine... But how about a sign telling me that?

This place could be AWESOME. But it's not and it will have to close and move to another location or make major changes..."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Some gourmet hot dog places use meh dogs and pile on tons of stuff. This place uses hot dogs that would taste great on their own and are even better with all the cool toppings. Plus: horchata ice cream. 

Also everyone was so friendly and sweet and have us some pumpkin spice ice cream to try. Super tasty!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for a while now. So my boyfriend and our friend decide to stop in.  Me and my bf got the patty melt on a lobster roll.  We also got the elote fries, the elote and the fried oreos.  We got our number and maybe about 5 minutes later our dirty dogs came out . Great presentation , looked awesome. The nice lady said the rest will be out right now. So we took a bite and the first thing off the bat the food was cold. The cheese tasted as if it was sitting in the fridge that's how cold it seemed . The taste was great I just didn't care how cold it was for it to made fresh. So a few minutes go by and no eltoe fries or elote. It's been about 10  minutes since our dogs came out then my elote fries come, then we wait about 5 more minutes and the corn comes out. Not to crazy about the corn , tasted like it was chargrilleed so we had a few bites and that was it. Elote fries were a tad to salty but overall good.  Our friends daughter got the kids menu chicken nuggets. Shes only 4 so she takes a bite and she got corn dogs instead which she doesn't like but we weren't about to wait another 15 minutes for it. Few minutes later the employee comes back and says oops I gave you corn dogs by accident instead.  Will I be back ?maybe if I was in the area.  Overall dirty dogs were good but If you want them cold and one item brought out at a time . By all means go ahead."}
{"text":"Such bomb food!! I've been here within that last 3 Days! I had the red dog with the elite and garlic fries the first time I came and I was hands down amazing!! Second time I came to try the tacos and it was amazing as well! Beers on tap"}
{"text":"The place is cute but it could need some music playing it's pretty low key and awkward. the menu is all bomb though they got a VEGETARIAN option. maybe the day time is more poppin we went close to closing"}
{"text":"Ahhhmazing! I had a hotdog off the secret menu \"patty melt\" most delcious hot dog I've ever had! && of course the dirty corn was a must have, Defiantly will be returning"}
{"text":"Hands down best dog in Vegas!!! The staff was wonderful... songs from the kitchen and excellent recommendations from the front counter. Can I say I was very hesitant on ordering ANY hot dog- you see I'm a Chicago style kinda girl... after a bit of an introduction to the menus OMG they were spot on - I went w the brown dog with the sweet bread! If I didn't die and go to heaven already w the hot dog  let's say Mexican street corn and fries are on point here!! Also this is the place to find deep fried Oreos and Twinkies..... ok ok bomb churros too!! It's a place you fear the unknown but soon are in love... don't be afraid to try- did I mention BACON? Yaaaa BACON on everything!!! Yeasssss!"}
{"text":"Cute clean, friendly staff. cool tunes the flavor of this food is top notch, also had no issue making accommodation for my dietary restrictions (gluten allergy/lactose intolerant)  will come again wasn't too busy right before noon on a weekday!"}
{"text":"They have the worst take out service in all of Nevada. They never answer their phone. Please hire more staff or competent staff."}
{"text":"Good food, worth the ride from north las vegas. The elite dog was really good!! Family had a great time..."}
{"text":"I got the half-red, half-green sauced hot dog. Flavor perfection. Perfectly grilled, a blend of amazing flavors. Fries were respectably decent. We also tried the tacos - I had the tacos al pastor. Not quite as awesome as Tacos el Gordo or Taco y Taco, but they were damned tasty. It's a little pricey for a hot dog joint, but it's also no ordinary hot dog joint. Prep time ran a bit long, but not overly so. I will be back."}
{"text":"If you're ever looking for a wonderful and unusual twist on a hotdog, then I have found the place for you! Dirt dog has been a local favorite in LA for years and has been coined \"The Official Hotdog of Los Angeles.\" Well guess what? It has finally come to Las Vegas! If you don't know what a Dirt dog is, here is a quick explanation. It is a 100% premium all beef weiner that is wrapped in a center cut slice of bacon, then served on your choice of bun and topped off with either the menu selection of toppings, or they allow you to create your own by mixing and matching for your own unique experience. This is Hands down the best Street dog I have ever tasted. The hotdog is never greasy and always tastey and served on a toasted, warm bun. Then they give you the perfect amount of topping to dog ratio and serve it to you al la carte or with a side of fries and drink if you choose. They are also open late for those of you who have a late night craving and they have a location on The Strip inside of Ballys. Seriously, this hotdog will curb any craving and your only regret is that you didn't buy 2"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs ever. We came back two days in a row because it was that good! Their filthy fries are amazing as well...and the corn....it's all good. Just go."}
{"text":"New Era Hot Dogs! I really enjoyed the atmosphere! The art! The thuggish ruggish music in the background. I enjoyed the service! The hot dogs are inspired by the streets of LA with a cheesy twist! I will definitely be back! The extra bonus to this place is the games! Loteria phase 10! It was a fun visit!"}
{"text":"OMG this was my first time trying this place and it was so so so so so so good from the dogs to the dirty corn to the ice cream oh my goodness you have to go in try this place and the bonus is the good food because you get great service there! And to me service is everything they even help me figure out what the order in detail. I will be returning love this place and the staff. ** insert emoji hearts here**"}
{"text":"Went here after seeing multiple posts on Instagram from friends and local food photographer accounts. The food looked delicious, and let me tell you....It tastes just as good as it looks. I had the mutt dog with elote and my SO had the dirt dog with garlic fries. My dog was a bit spicy, but the flavor packed a punch. And elote is always a weakness of mine so eating it here was a treat. The ranch that accompanies the fries is garlicky as well and we couldn't get enough of it. Topped the meal off with the horchata ice cream and we went home with more than happy stomachs. I would highly recommend this place for anyone that's in the mood for a quick, messy, yet tasty meal. We will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Lucky us! We decided to give Dirt Dogs a try last night and they were hosting a free tasting (whoop whoop!). Great way to try a few of their menu items so I know what to order on my next visit. Had the House, Brown, Green, Mutt (secret menu item) Dogs and the Dirty Corn. They also offered a Red Dog, but I was too full, lol. 

The House Dog was my favorite. All the dogs are great tasting, quality ingredients, but the House Dog had all the right flavors and textures for my palette. The Green was also a hit for me. The Brown Dog had an Asian influence and the Mutt was just that...a \"mutt\" mixture of other dogs combined. Beware, it was really spicy! We skipped the Red Dog, but that too looked very spicy. The Dirty Corn was the highlight of the evening! Basically Mexican street corn, soooo good!

We also ordered Garlic Fries and Dirty Chips. Both were okay, the chips were slightly burnt for my taste and the fries didn't have a ton of flavor on its own. But the aioli dipping sauce that come with the Garlic Fries are a perfect complement and really elevated the flavor. My hubby tried the Deep Fried Twinkie which I wouldn't recommend - it was soaked in grease, perhaps cooked for too long, or at the wrong temperature.

The owner and chef spoke briefly during the tasting. The concept is street food style served in a sit down setting. They mentioned everything, down to the bacon bits, is house made.

All in all, hot dogs are excellent, highly recommend the Dirty Corn, but the other sides/dessert are just okay. Would definitely go back though!"}
{"text":"I'm not a hot dog fan, but as a pregnant lady, the patty melt hot dog pretty bomb - get it on the lobster roll:) the filthy fries are bomb too! It's the different aioli sauces that make these items legit. And if none of that is your food of choice, then their street tacos are amazing. The red salsa is a must with their guacamole. Definitely a place where ppl go to indulge, so bring your fat girl/boy appetite and be ready to grub. The environment and decor pays homage to iconic LA scenes and people, along with the music which is mostly west coast rap music - I dig it! Overall, a great place to get your cheat day fix and a really indulgent hot dog."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I dont usually eat hot dogs but i could eat theirs everyday. Corn on the cop is stupid delicious as well. I live 20miles away from them but I dont even mind drive over there. Also Decent selection of beer and kind staffs are plus. Although waitline can be super long but its worth it to wait"}
{"text":"I don't want to give an unfavorable review to this place because they just opened up few weeks ago, so i'm just gonna say they could improve on two things and this was based from my first visit on 3rd July. First, i waited too long for a ONE hotdog take-out on a not so busy time. I was told i would be called if my order is ready but i had to follow it up. I could see it was ready because i was sitting on the table next to the cashier. Second, the waiter service needs improvement on attentiveness. My order was sitting on the counter while the waiter/waitress was chatting. And although the waiter was apologetic for the long wait which i appreciated, they would really look good in the customers' eyes if they would pay more attention to the wait time."}
{"text":"The food here is really good but they are pretty overpriced for a hot dog place. We had two hot dogs and an order of fries and it was $24.00 
The staff are friendly but can be a little faster.  There was only one couple ahead of us and we still had to waive about 15 minutes for our order."}
{"text":"I'm no ELITE but I've eaten in lots of restaurants.  Their street dogs rock!! Make sure you the lobster roll for the bun.  Fries are crispy and tasty. Get the Mexican corn.  Avoid tye tacos.  Thank you LA for letting Vegas have your street food."}
{"text":"Another great addition to my neighborhood. We had the green dog, chili dog ( lobster roll ) and filthy fries. They also have Mexican Coke. I will be back to check out the street tacos. Good music too"}
{"text":"Dirt Dog is a great option for a quick, affordable bite for lunch or dinner. Incredibly high quality bacon wrapped hot dogs and so much more! 

They have a wide selection of over the top dogs; don't skip the lobster roll bun- it's delicious and helps to keeps all the toppings contained. The Elote Dog is my personal favorite, I have ordered it both times I have been there following a hosted event. 

They have the usual suspects for sides, some also taken to the next level with toppings. But for a hot dog joint, the most notable thing on the menu is their vegan taco.. yes, you read that right- VEGAN TACO! They offer a few varieties of street tacos but the soyrizo is the best in my opinion, even for meat eaters. 

They also offer a decent selection of beers, fried Oreo desserts, and a true to their LA roots atmosphere, complete with Tupac music and murals. They also have a fun map mural that serves as an interactive guestbook, allowing guests to pin where they live in the greater Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, bland food. Anything with \"chili powder\" tastes like actual chili seasoning, not the spicy kick you'd be expecting. It ended up making the two vegan tacos I ordered taste like they had actual chili in them. The corn in the cup was flavorless as well, and also tasted like chili. My fiancé even said it when he tried it. He got the chili dog and said it wasn't good at all: there was no flavor at all. Everything was good quality and homemade BUT NO FLAVOR OR SPICE. 

Although the atmosphere was nice (they played modern music and had board games to play), you go to a restaurant to eat and the food is not worth it and outweighs anything good about Dirt Dog. I'm sad, and the pictures looked so good. What a let down."}
{"text":"Service was slow with one person working the register and serving for the whole restaurant during peak lunch time. Hotdogs were expensive and not filling for 7.25 each. I think I would need 3 of them to get full. Got the garlic fries and it was a good serving for 3.25 but it seems like that was all I ate since the dog was gone in a few bites. Can't justify paying $25+ for lunch to get full here. Going to have to find something to eat shortly.... wtf."}
{"text":"I don't really miss Los Angeles, so trying this place was pretty low on my priorities. But I finally did and I'm happy with the experience here. It's pretty amusing to see an LA-themed restaurant here in Las Vegas. But I did love the 90s Rap/Hip Hop that's constantly playing. On a side note, there seems to be a Tupac Amaru Shakur tribute vibe here as well (as there should be!) I loved the ambience. They also have those angel wings painted on a wall of which girls love to pose in front of and post on instagram for the 999999th time. But hey, it's free hashtag advertising for this place, right? And they have some board games that you can play at your table while you are visiting. 
You have a wide variety of choices and options here. You can get any dog with a choice of your normal bun, Texas toast, lobster bun, or Portuguese bun. I've never tried the Portuguese bun, so I got the Ranchero Dog with the Portuguese today. They also have a lot of other street food type items here as well such as nachos and tacos. And their desserts look fabulous. I didn't try any desserts this time because I could feel my love handles growing just by reading the dessert menu. The dogs themselves are not huge. They are normal length so they won't stuff you. In fact, if you have one of those big \"American\" appetites, one dog may not satisfy you.  I also had their garlic fries. Very good but a tad oily especially the fries on the bottom of the box. 
My only gripe about this visit was that my fries took a while to come out. My dog came out and I finished eating it long before the fries came out. No biggie. I was in no rush. The staff was very cool and friendly so it was fine. 
I'm looking forward to coming here again and trying more items. I only had this place a handful of times back in Los Angeles, so I'll try everything else here."}
{"text":"The mintute i stepped into this place i fell in love with the vibe. They have the dirtiest hotdogs, the best fries and awesome horchata. Plus they have 90s hip hop playing, which i enjoy.  If your from L.A. , you'll absolutely love this place just as much as i did."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very modern, him, and casual. This place is busy but the staff is efficient in getting your order taken care of. It's LA style with good old school hip hop playing as you eat. Variety of items to choose from, even street tacos. Churros aren't worth the price, very small, like two drops of dog poo. Sorry to sound mean bit disappointed in the size. Lol swap meet has better price and size. A craving is a craving though. The menu is full of every combo you can want to try. The elote dog was delicious.  Overall great experience. Next time I'll have to get their drinks."}
{"text":"The food was tasty the service was great. I can believe how spicy the red sauce hotdog was!"}
{"text":"Ok, first off...I'm not a big hot dog fan. These looked so good I had to try. I had the Green Dog on a Lobster bun... I HAVE NEVER had such a yummy hotdog! Now, I want one every day! The restaurant had a friendly atmosphere, the service was fast, even tho they were packed! The girl who brought out my to go order was sweet and very accommodating. Great job DirtDog! I will be back! ( probably tomorrow! )"}
{"text":"The dogs are sooo good. Ordered the brown dog and dirty corn (elote). Awesome food! They play 90's hip hop and the decor is reminiscent of LA. Get the lobster bun with your dog!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  I love the vibe i love the dogs even more. Ladies take that free diet day and go craxy."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped hot dog covered in cheese sauce bacon bits and seasoned French fries. Yes this is a Real thing and it's AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!!!!
they have an incredibly varied menu not just hot dogs but also Mexican style Elote street corn on the cob.
Not cheap but also not real expensive. Check this place out they have BEER TOO !!!!!!
I will be going frequently. Very friendly and informative staff it has an urban / punk rock Vibe super fun place."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and very tasty (especially for the pickiest eaters) Overall it was just amazing all around!!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place with two friends. I had the veggie dog mutt style, which btw, you could not tell was meatless! I've had several vegetarian/vegan hot dogs only to be let down by the flavor & texture, but Dirt Dog has figured the veggie dog out! 
Friend #1 ordered a mutt dog while friend #2 tried a dirty chili dog. Loved it! 
We all had a beer. We shared filthy fries, dirty corn & street tacos. Enjoyed all of it! No shortage of flavor. 
The atmosphere is laid back. Cool artwork on the walls. Great place to enjoy beers & a bite to eat while listening to old school Hip-Hop."}
{"text":"I recently ate here at dirty dog and the food was really good. There is a line when entering but the line goes fast. Every worker there are friendly and they all smile! Right after we ordered we waited less than 10 minutes and our food was ready. Mind you they are very busy and still managed to get us our food less than 10 minutes. Definitely would come back and recommend others to eat here."}
{"text":"My friend summed this up for me.. \"Dirt Dog was a basket of disappointment.\"

We'd eagerly planned our trip to Dirt Dog for weeks, looked at Instagram and Facebook videos, and had our mouths and taste buds all ready for some decadent deliciousness. But alas, it was not to be. 

The line was long, but moved swiftly. You place your order at the counter and your food is delivered to your table. Service was pleasant and our food took about 10 min to arrive. Two of the dirty dogs and an order of filthy fries cost about $22. 

Now, the food.. that's the disappointing part. My friend got the patty melt dog, I got the elote dog,and my boyfriend got the chili dog. We split an order of the filthy fries. The fries were definitely the best part of the meal. Covered with melted cheese, bacon bits, and guacamole, they were a treat. They weren't as hot as I'd like, but that was in part because of the cool guacamole on top.

The dogs though.. they were more like sad puppies. They weren't fully wrapped in bacon, and the lobster butter rolls definitely weren't buttery as promised. My dog had the most \"stuff\" on it, but it didn't really make sense- it just was a lot of corn that didn't really taste like anything , the cheese was overpowering in flavor, and the hot dog was WAY too salty. It just felt like a waste of calories and elevated blood pressure .

My friend was similarly disappointed by her patty melt dog. Not enough cheese and the bun was also not buttery and was dry. My boyfriend gave the chili dog another blah review. 

Just felt meh all around and I won't be going out of my way to walk these dogs anytime soon."}
{"text":"I tried their LA location first & the experience was beyond phenomenal. It was the best hot dog (Veggie Green dog) I have ever tasted. So when I heard about their Las Vegas location I was ecstatic. The cashier was attentive and did a good job of greeting us. We ordered 4 veggie dogs green style and fries. The fries were unappealing & tasted below average. Comparable to bad fast food fries. The veggie dogs came out impeccably horrible. Immediately the appearance was much different from my previous outing. The dogs themselves looked yellow. The toppings were poorly cut and the pieces were comically big. The dog was Las Vegas comparable dry. Very little sauce & the toppings were almost completely different than the Dirt Dog in LA we had a week prior. No salsa, very very little cilantro, bun was terrible, & the Veggie dog lacked any flavor and tasted like it was sitting in water for days. Wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone. It needs major research on its LA brethren."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to grab a drink after work. They have multiple beers on tap however they were out of Stella the night we came. No liquor.  We also ended up ordering quite a few items on the menu. They were playing alot of hip hop music.... 2Pac and Eminem! Love the atmosphere. Service is fast and employees were pleasant. A must try is the Elote dog....yup just like it sounds elotes over a hotdog! They have a selection of hotdogs, fries, and street tacos. Definitely would come back to try the other items on menu."}
{"text":"I got the chilli dirty dog, and it was good but I don't think worth $10 For just the dog. The environment is nice, played only topic music. Liked the layout and the restroom was big and cozy."}
{"text":"This place has absolutely delicious food. The hot dogs are cheesy and amazing. The corn is great! I love that you can choose on or off the cob. :D the only downside is if it's busy, the line gets cramped at the door and it's difficult to get a seat or table. It's worth going for the food. You can get it to go I'd you want. I would recommend you go even if just once."}
{"text":"BEEF HOT DOGS?! (There's also a Vegetarian option) OKAY SURE! 

The moment we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by Cassie. She provided kind and bubbly service as talked about Pokemon Go and the menu, of course. She was able to help us with all of our questions. 

My boyfriend got the House Dog and a side of garlic fries. 
House Dog w/ Lobster-style bread: Seemed like a normal hot dog, nothing too fancy. 
Garlic Fries: He would get it again. I personally expected more, could skip. 

My sister and I shared the Green Dog w/ Lobster-style bread and the Dirty Esquite (I call it the dirty corn in a cup).
Green Dog: Very refreshing and light. The bread was toasty AND buttery..
the perfect combination. 
Dirty Esquite: A street corn lover's dream. My sister has braces, so this was very convenient for her. The bacon added a nice crunch but would love more added into it!

Last but not least, you can't skip on dessert. \"Food is for the stomach; dessert is for the soul.\" 
Horchata Ice Cream: For the price, there is a generous amount of pleasure in every bite. The horchata ice cream had a smooth, cinnamon flavor, along with Rice Krispie bits and some nuts (is available without nuts as well). The crunch definitely added to its consistency. With the churro on top, this dessert will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth. 

Although there are some things that we would skip out on, we are looking forward to trying the rest of the menu and returning soon."}
{"text":"What a find!!! The best hot dogs we've ever had and we have had hot sogs all over the country! And so many varieties. The flavors were delicious. The esquite corn as such a treat. We had the dirty chili dogs and wow!!! The dirty fries were delicious. And the garlic fries were also oozing with flavor. We loved dirt dogs.  Atmosphere was comfortable and employees were friendly and checked on us several times to make sure we were enjoying our food. The churros for dessert were the bomb!!! Will recommend to everyone we know."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a hundred times but never came in because, honestly, hot dogs covered with tons of stuff sounds \"too much\" to me. I'm normally a plain dog eater, maayyybe a dot of mustard or kraut. So I was expecting a kick to the face of intense flavors. I was pleasantly surprised (shocked, even) that the dogs are balanced and not overpowering. They're delicious!! The Elote Dog is EVERYTHING. Also the best jamaica drink I've tried. And do yourself a favor and get some deep fried oreos with horchata whipped cream. 

While I love the 2pac and old school tunes they play, I do wish they were the edited versions since I bring my kids here.

Tip: Allow yourself ample time when coming here. They prepare each item fresh and it's a smaller mom-n-pop-type shop, so they have a smaller staff. Don't expect to be in and out like you would getting a dog at sam's club."}
{"text":"Both times I went they messed up my order, but the food is very good! Lobster roll is where it's at"}
{"text":"Where has this place been my whole life!!! I love food trucks and this place give you the feel of that. The decor is really cool almost like a tattoo shop. I saw angel wings which is inspiring my new tattoo. Not to mention all the Tupac music, I was in heaven. The food did not disappoint either. I wanted to try everything on the menu! I decided on the Red Dog with sweet bun, elote corn, and horrchata ice cream. Everything was delicious the Red Dog had just enough spice with the red flakes on top. The corn was good and off the cob just like I like it. Ice cream hit the right spot after my entree. The service was quick and friendly.  I will be back when my hot dog craving hits again!"}
{"text":"I had the dirty chili dog and it was ok. It was good quality meat but a bit salty for my taste between the chilly and the wrapped bacon. Be prepared to order fully loaded hotdogs, there aren't any regular traditional hotdogs. Garlic fries were the bomb tho."}
{"text":"Great service , great food ! The elote dog, ranchero dog, garlic fries and filthy fries were bomb with a draft modelo on side while they were bumping some Tupac and cypress hill."}
{"text":"Yummy! Very busy!!! We've been here a few times. Totally enjoy the beer on tap with my dog. The street corn fries and the salt/pepper fries are great! If you have a group, it's worth sharing some different flavors!  Love the red dog, green dog, street corn dog, etc!!! The hotdogs are wrapped in bacon but honestly I can never taste the bacon. But You can't go wrong if you like hotdogs. There are s few buns to choose from and my buns are always great because I ask the staff which they recommend for each dog. The street corn in a cup is nice and clean but it does not compare to the flavor of the hot cheetoes street corn! A must if you like hot cheetoes!!! Also a must, the horchata ice cream!!!  The ice cream is shareable & It comes with a churro. The only problem is they are so busy, you have to order with your food order or wait forever in line again. The staff is pretty good about bringing it to you later after you've eaten. Originally from LA, you've got to check this place out."}
{"text":"So my son seen this place on his instagram and said it looked good. So I decided to take my son and his brothers tonight and give it a try. I will say the food was really good all of my boys really enjoyed it. They had the patty melt dog and I had the dirty chili dog. We also got an order of the dirty chili fries.  The only thing I didn't like was the price. I think they should raise the price of the dogs by $2.00 and give French fries. We spend over $50.00 for five of us and only got one side of fries and 3 beverages....we will be back but only on special occasions as this will break the bank$$$$$...."}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas and wanted to grab a quick bite before checking in to our hotel, so we decided to stop here. The food was very good, and was prepared in a timely manner. Their hotchata could've been better but nevertheless it was worth stopping by. The workers were super friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a quick bite/snack to hold you up for a while."}
{"text":"Saw an ad for this place on FB and it EXCEEDED expectations. The staff is super friendly and accomodating. Being our first time there they took the time to explain the menu and give us their best reccomendations. We ordered Elote Fries, Carne Asada Tacos, and the Flaming Hot Mexican Street Corn. Everything was too good for words. We came in starving and we left with a fulfilling and savory meal. Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Great taste, and not so big that you can't eat it comfortable without making a huge mess. She had the patty melt dog, I had the dirty chili dog, and we split the dirty esquite (corn), everything was great. Bonus- Tupac themed!"}
{"text":"Hot digity dog! This place is amazing!!! Found it on yelp, bookmarked it and surprised my husband by taking us here one day. 

We were greeted right when we walked in , and saw the clear menu options. We ordered and grabbed one of the fun games to play while we waited for the food. I had to try the amazing cheese corn. I thought it was going to be a bit much, but the flavors are so much better than you anticipate. Can't wait to have another one. 

We will def. be back. Good drink selection as well.
Mour only complaint. Our meals came out much sooner than the kids meal. So we waited to eat ours until she had hers and it was quite some time. Usually they make sure kids get there's first. Granted mini corn dogs sometimes take longer but they should make sure the items are all done at the same time or at least make sure kids meals come first . It was ok that the corn was done 20 minutes later ."}
{"text":"This place is so good it will have you eating the crumbs! The teriyaki brown dog was so good and flavorful. It is kids friendly and the beer is great. Great customer service."}
{"text":"I'm glad they put something great in the old Cheeburger Cheeburger spot. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is great, lots of seating and over all a clean place. Just wish they would have gotten my order right and hadn't put cilantro on my food.. I'm not allergic but have an aversion to it and makes stuff taste like soap.. other than that! This place is a must.. specially in the booming SouthWest!"}
{"text":"My favorite Hot Dog restaurant in the United States! As a self proclaimed \"Hot Dog Connoisseur\" I give this place 3 thumbs up! I can only plead with you from one Human being to another... do yourself a favor and get there today! You have not lived until you have eaten here! I would say \"all joking aside..\" but I am not. 

The customer service is lively and excellent! They also have booze and board games so its family friendly!  Great variety of games."}
{"text":"Yasss ok?! First timer, when my husband was describing it, I was like sure - because I love hot dogs. But let me tell you, this place is more than just hot dogs, they are dirty style type dogs. I ended up getting the green dog in a lobster roll type bun, chimichurri sauce, guacamole, sautéed onions, and grilled red peppers. It was packed with flavor, I pretty much ate the whole thing in under 5 minutes. I wanted to savor the flavors, but man it's a hot dog with a flavor punch. I also decided to go with their salt and pepper fries, elote (Mexican corn on a cob), and deep fried Twinkie! Hello! Everything was great, not overly greasy ( and that's including the deep fried Twinkees and fries ) and hey guys who live on the Southwest side of town, here is a great place to get an elote --- you don't have to drive all the way to the Eastside. Overall very informing cashier/server, service was good, it had a nice vibe with the throwback music, and just a place I want to throw a beer back with good eats."}
{"text":"Shout out too my partner and yelper Suzy H for telling me about Dirt Dog. We decided to go on there soft opening date. I know not the most ideal time check out brand new restaurant. They had some kinks that needed work out. None of the taps were running, fountain machine was down, and most of the bottle drinks never had time chill. It was expected so NONE of it bothered me. Really the star of the show was the Dirt Dogs. 

So one thing always count on dining with Suzy H we make sure try the menu. We got three different dogs. The Green, Red, and the Mutt dog combination of the two (also secret menu item). The Red Dog stole the show out of the three. At first thinking not that spicy after the first couple bites. Talk about subtle just kick you right in the mouth. By the end was hurting needed take breather before started on the second Green Dog. I like spicy food. It not crazy over the top heat but just be warned some kick too it. Green Dog fan of the chimichurri sauce. Overall nothing that stood out or worked for me compare to the Red Dog. Or maybe the Red Dog killed my taste buds. lol!!! The Mutt Dog if looking try both really great option. 

The base of all the hot dogs are bacon wrapped Nathans brand hot dogs. I have seen before but not whole menu based alone on the concept. I love the concept!! The bacon nice crispy on the outside. It gives the hot dog more body and keep Nathans hot dog more moist/hot. The topping on both dogs really complimented the whole dog. The Green Dog not make as much of lasting impact compare to the Red. The buns that another Dirt Dog concept or one of the options lobster style roll. I think lobster roll should be given with any Dirt Dog. It not only reminded me of quality lobster roll sandwich. It adds so much more flavor then regular hot dog bun. Talk about reasonable priced. Not only reasonable compare to basic hot dog on any strip casino or casino. The quality your getting speaks for itself. The simplicity of the menu fan of three different parts Dogs, Sides, and Desserts. Less think about and for me everything had was awesome or solid. The sides we got the Garlic Fries and Mexican Corn. Both solid. 

The desserts that FIVE star da bomb. I came back on second visit ONLY for desserts. Nothing could damper the fact had my first Deep Fried Twinkie. Deep Fried Oreo enough said. They ran out of Horachata Ice Cream. I like the fact they make it fresh every day and went at the end of service . They ran out. Just gives me another reason come back!!! Second visit came with my cousins visiting and doing out tradition food tours around Vegas. Dirt Dog was perfect dessert spot on my radar and talking about Deep Fried goodness. It was heavenly. The Twinkie the cream that came running out on was awesome. They have sauce for both but truth neither one needs it. 

The service every person came in contact with was friendly, awesome, and the manager very much around checking on guests. Five star service both times I visited. 

One thing find the place is if looking for it at night. The sign no lighting around it. If anything look for Sparklings well lit sign and its in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Hubby showed me the menu and we decided to call in an order. Good thing too because when he went to pick them up at 7:30 on a Saturday night and he said it was packed!
My husband and son got plain bacon wrapped dogs on a butter bun and seasalt fries. No complaints there.
I had the brown dog and filthy fries. I just about died with every bite of the brown dog. The flavor profile was spot on; saltiness of the dog and the sweet and savory of the teriyaki and sesame on the Portuguese bun. I got the chipotle aoli on the side which was a good thing since the salt and pepper already added a nice kick to the fries. Ended up maxing out but happily full.

Next was the churros. This was the only reason we took off a star. They were kind of puny in size (that's what she said) and unfortunately while they looked tasty, they ended up being raw inside.

All in all a great meal. We will probably pass on dessert next time. The takeaway message here is that there will likely be a next time."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot dogs I've ever had! First day I tried the red dog which has sautéed bell peppers and onions in their spicy red sauce on top of a bacon wrapped hot dog... I seriously cannot describe how delicious it was. I loved it so much that I came back the next day for the chili dog which didn't have any veggies but was also scrumptious!

It's located in the little plaza just outside Bally's hotel. Each hot dog is about 7 bucks and service is fast... what else could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Hands down, Best HotDog spot in Vegas. Must try everything! Big Ups to Sean. Greatly appreciate the exceptional customer service.  

So far we tried the patty melt dog, green dog, red dog & elote dog. All AMAZING!!!! The street tacos are also exceptional. To top it all off, the fried Oreos and Twinkies for dessert; one word DELICIOUS! 

Oh did I mention they serve beer??? Come here with your friends, family or just to chill! Love the vibes, love the service and love the food!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing vibe to it. The service is unbelievable great. The food is awesome. They always check up on you. They gave board games to keep you entertained until you get your food. A little concerned they didn't fill up the sauces but it's ok!
Awesome place overall!!"}
{"text":"Bomb AF! Best hot dogs ever! House dog & the green dog were the best on lobster buns! Dirty fries were awesome! Definitely a new favorite place to eat. Had great service food came out fast & place is clean! We will be back !"}
{"text":"What a mess. Just waited over 25 minutes for my order with two items. Would have been longer if I wouldn't have noticed that more than 3 parties who ordered after me received their food. So basically my order had been ready but no one was able to bag it until I asked about my order. Food is good but I am not prepared to come again if staff is unable to track of orders thst are ready. Also how are you out of Carne Asada on a weekend and beer as well?"}
{"text":"Super bomb hot dogs and friendly staff.   They got a good little bar setup and lots of parking outside.   It looks like they just got an awesome paint job inside too.  Has a true LA feel complete with Tupac lol."}
{"text":"2 hotdogs, fries, one cup of corn and drinks for $25. Meh

Got the chimichurri (green) dog and the house dog. Got the option of regular bun, Portuguese bun, and lobster bun (up charge). Tried the Portuguese and lobster bun. Find absolutely nothing special about the lobster bun. Portuguese bun was good. These dogs were okay, but nothing too special or interesting. 

I am a lover of all things potato. And these potatoes were very disappointing. Tried the garlic fries and dirty chips. The garlic fries were like regular fries with some dried roasted garlic sprinkled on top. The chips were seasoned. Both were dry and lacked flavor...

The cup of corn... It was fresh grilled corn which was nice. Still lacked flavor.

Overall, seemed like a great idea but nothing quite delivered. Price seemed pricy for street style food.. I much prefer Buldogis for hot dogs with flare.

I went to this place hungry, and things should always taste better when you're hungry... And that didn't happen. The guy that helped us was very nice though."}
{"text":"Loved the hot dog! Loved the atmosphere! Loved the music played in the restaurant! Everything was delicious and made correctly. The soda fountain was out of CO2 when I visited, so that would be the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars. The guy that took our order warned us though, so that was nice! The lobster roll bread was amazing! I could eat just that and be happy! Can't wait to come back and try the Mexican corn!"}
{"text":"Wow! I was invited to the ribbon cutting ceremony and was able to try almost everything. Even with all of the crazy toppings you can get, you still taste the GREAT hot dog! The garlic fries...OH MY! Then the fried twinkie and fried oreos..C'MON!
So good and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"The dogs are so yummy here. Can't wait to go back and get some more and try the other flavored hot dogs they have."}
{"text":"This is a pretty hot spot. L.A. music is playing. It's got the downtown L.A. feel to it with a local artist. And the food is dope. 

I got the Elote Dog, dirty fries, and a churro.

Bomb.

Go for it. You will enjoy it"}
{"text":"These hotdogs are the absolute bomb! This restaurant is really really cool, and the food is just off the hook. We thoroughly enjoyed eating here as these were probably the best hotdogs we've ever had."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!  Staff is so friendly and helpful!! Make sure you ask about the \"secret\" menu ;)
Definitely a new eating spot for us!!!"}
{"text":"Every single hotdog on the menu is so good! Def have to try the fried Oreos!! Also the elote fries"}
{"text":"Really friendly owner and staff. Ryan was very attentive and gave good recommendations. We had the dirty corn, the coconut water, the green dog and the brown dog. They were both really good I can't wait to come back and try the other ones."}
{"text":"So when we first walked in I was skeptical about $6 hotdogs (no side or drink included) and only a few options. The menu is as simple as it looks, but it works.
I had The Green Dog, with chimichurri sauce and avocado spread, on a Portuguese bun, which is a slightly sweet bread. It was delicious. My husband had The Original, which is wrapped in bacon and topped with 1000 Island, ketchup and mustard, also on the sweet Portuguese bun. It was also delicious, though I liked mine better.
We got a side of the chili and limon fries, that came with a spicy ketchup. They were good, and I think the ketchup definitely made them better. We also got the side of corn with cheese, though I can't remember what it was called. I didn't care for it, my husband liked it, and I think it would have been better mixed instead of layered. I might try it again.
They couldn't serve beer last night because their machine wasn't cooling it. We both had the bottled, Mexican, Coke. The Coke was good of course, but we were disappointed that there wasn't any beer available. Luckily the food was good enough on its own.
Other than the beer not being available there was one more negative and it had to do with cleanliness. It's a pet peeve of mine, but tables and seats had crumbs on them as we walked pass. Also, some of the staff was sitting and chatting, when someone should have taken the time to make a pass to clean up more. 
The staff was all very friendly, even the ones sitting around for a bit. They played 90s music that was little loud, had sports plating on TVs, and had a big picture of Tupac on top of the soda fridge. Their only other location is in LA.
I really enjoyed the food, and will for sure be back for another $6 hotdog. And who knows. Maybe the tables and seats no one is sitting at will all be clean as a bonus."}
{"text":"IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH TRYING!!  My friend suggested we go here for lunch yesterday. I went into this with no real expectations. After all, she told me it was a hot dog restaurant. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by staff. Though the menu is not extensive, there are several different options to choose from. I had the dirty chili dog, with garlic fries. They were both delicious. The only thing I could have asked for is, possibly, a spicier dog or chili. A little heat would have put that hot dog over the top. To cap off our lunch, we ordered the deep-fried Twinkie, Oreos and Churro. I had never had any of those. They, too, were delicious. When you think about a hot dog and fries, the prices are a little higher than what you would probably expect to pay. So, though it will not become a regular haunt for us, we will return occasionally for a hot dog, Twinkie and Oreo fix. Also, the music playing inside the restaurant was good. If I had an alcoholic beverage, I would have thought I was in a nightclub. They have added 3 more satisfied customers to their list."}
{"text":"look, the hot dogs are good. And the dirty esquite tastes great, but for the love of all that is good and holy, make sure you clean the corn silk out of the esquite. It's really irritating to have to pull out those scraggly fibers out with each bite."}
{"text":"Amazing! Might be the best Hot Dog I've ever had. Shared the House (bacon wrapped)  and Dirty Chili dog along with filthy fries ...the fries were ridiculous as well..chipotle aoli ..guacamole bacon and lots of cheese! Worth the drive."}
{"text":"My friends and I had tried their elote fries while having some drinks at Fuel Bar near their strip location in the bazaar shops in front of Bally's. The BF and I wanted something low key for dinner so we made the trek down.  We almost didn't walk in because of the line to the door and it looked like no tables were available. I'm happy to say we stayed and I'm sooooooo glad we did! Variety of dogs and fries, even tacos, and corn! He had the dirty chili dog, I had the House dog and we each shared garlic and elote fries. Hands down best French fries I have ever had! Usually when you order garlic fries, midway through eating them, they turn soggy but not these ones! Seriously the best French fries I've ever eaten!  I was a tad confused by my house dog thinking it would have thousand island dressing, green chili sauce and the standard toppings. I did not expect the ketchup and mustard on it but regardless, it was delicious!  There are so many choices and all look spectacular so we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Carry 2 healthy options and never stop selling young coconuts I am so upset right now. Love the other stuff I've tried too just not a hot dogger."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had the elote dog which i choose the lobster roll option for. Dog was perfectly cooked and the bread was toasted and the ingredients they put on top were omg amazing. The cheese was a perfect amount not skimpy and not over the top. We also had the garlic fries which were very crisp and wasn't overwhelming topped with garlic chunks which I appreciated. The girl who took our order was very pleasant and went over the whole menu with us. The atmosphere was super cool with Los Angeles inspired murals and a large city map. There also is a giant wall of hot sauces about every kind you could think of that you can pick from to use on your hot dog, we will definitely be making the trip to eat here every time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Stoppedbin today for some elote fries but saw they have added, not only street tacos, but Vegan ones! I am on the path to vegan and these were great! I most definetly will be back and also will let my vegan friends know! As always the flavors were on point!"}
{"text":"A 4 due to service only, hot dog came came out long before fries and corn, very friendly when ordering and food was good, fair price, will be back. We had the dirty corn, al
Pastor fries, mutt dog and the dirty chili dog"}
{"text":"Soooooo, honestly, I'm sad. I really really wanted to love this place, but I'm just in like at best.

I liked the 4 hotdogs that we had (house dog, red dog, green dog and patty melt dog) but that was it. I was expecting a huge party in my mouth with tons of flavors but I missed the party. 

Tupac was playing when I walked in and I felt like I was home, then I saw the board games and thought my 3 year old would have fun here. I got home with my to go order, ate and now I feel jipped. 

The house dog had a ton of mayo on it which ruined it for me personally but it should be Great for you mayo lovers. The only thing I tasted on the patty melt was the fries. The red dog had the most flavor but was a little weird for me. The green dog was my fave but I needed more toppings, I was left with a handful of bread at the end. Speaking of bread; I tried all three options and everything was good but I'm not sure what the \"lobster\" in lobster bread was all about. Tasted like Texas toast to me. The only thing that knocked our socks off was the cashier who took my phone order and gave me my order, she was nice, and dessert. We really enjoyed the fried Twinkie, churros and Horchata ice cream. 

I feel like I cant be the only person to not love this place so I'm going to go back and try some other items on the menu even though the bf doesn't want to go back. I was disappointed to find there are several more items on the menu in the restaurant than there were on the dirt dog website menu. I would have been all over some carne asada fries and maybe even the corn with the hot Cheetos!"}
{"text":"The staff is fun, the place is fun, 75% of the food was good. Everything was awesome besides the patty melt and the amount of chipotle mayo used. I absolutely hated it imagine mouthfuls of chipotle mayo on a hot dog and that is the patty melt. I thought it would be cheesy goodness but it was just a painful amount of chipotle mayo. Almost everything had chipotle mayo on it and nobody can enjoy that much chipotle mayo and be sane. I wish they developed flavors more instead of squirting some Kroger's chipotle aoili on the whole thing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat hot dogs. The green dog is very delicious. I recommend this place to everyone. It's so good."}
{"text":"Finallly! After weeks of me talking about how I wanted to try this place out and watching multiple foodies rave about this place. My BF and I made it to Dirt Dog.

I haven't been eating meat much and today was the day to indulge a little bit. 

As we entered we were greeted by a girl at the counter, she was friendly and told us to order when we were ready. We stood there for a moment (since it was our first time) and checked out the menu. No one in line but us. My BF mentioned that it was our first time and asked suggestions and that's when the girl at the counter went over how it all works, gave us customer favorites, her favorites and was able to answer all our questions. 

After drooling over their menu on the wall for several minutes, we finally made our decisions. I got the #DirtyChiliDog topped with their house made chili and melted bacon cheddar. My BF got the #PattyMelt topped with the melted cheddar fries and Chipotle Aioli Spread. Oh, and let's not forget the #DirtyChiliFries which is also topped with their house made chili.

We didn't wait long until our food came out. Everything looked so yummy as the food came to our table. Definitely an Instagram worthy type of lookin' food!?!@?

Overall, customer service was great! The restaurant was clean, love the decor and the music. Now, the food...It wasn't bad, nothing too special, I guess with all the hype, I was expecting more. My BF and I felt that the food was a little too salty for us which I think is the main reason why we didn't LOVE IT like we had thought we would. 

Maybe we'll give it another go, there were some other items I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Best chili dog I have ever had! The lobster roll makes it so much better. Filthy fries are just that... FILTHY and delicious. Tried all three desserts and the churro with horchata ice cream was to die for! Only disappointing thing was everything came out totally separate and not everyone had their food at the same time."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my husband tonight and we were pleasantly surprised. Spacious restaurant with easy to choose menu. All hotdogs, minus the veggie dog, are bacon wrapped with 3 different bun options. There's also a secret menu which we were educated on by our pleasant cashier/bartender. Good beer choices on tap although they were out of a few due to changing out the kegs. Overall a good neighborhood restaurant with good service, good beer and delicious hot dogs. Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite and the service was  fantastic.  We tried several different hot dogs which they offered to cut in half so they can be shared.  Keep in mind three hot dogs shared between two is plenty and you could even get away with two since the hot dogs were above average size.  We weren't huge fans of the patty melt dog, the house was very good, but the best was the teriyaki dog.  Also, get the Mexican corn in a cup as well as the ice cream both were delicious, you won't be disappointed. 

The young lady running the counter was not just friendly and helpful but really cared about meal and made several recommendations and accommodations.... not sure if she was the owner but either way she treated us like friends who just walked in off the street. 

You should make your way here if you are in town, it's a quick 5-10 car ride from the strip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got the patty melt and LOVED IT. I got the mutt with a veggie dog. Great place for vegetarians that don't just wanna eat a salad. My elote in a cup, sorry forgot the name, was amazing. Def would come back for more. Only got 4-5 stars because my mutt dog lacked a little flavor but was overall pleasing."}
{"text":"Eating hear was something I was looking forward to for awhile and let me tell you.... it was refreshing to have something so good and full of flavors! I'll most definitely eat there again and bring friends and family to. It's close to our house, but I do wish they delivered."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got the dirty chili dog that we couldn't get a pic of because he devoured it! Fried ores were just as good  but the tacos were the only disappointment. Anishya took care of us, make sure she's here when you come. She made our dining experience 10X better and hooked us with more fried Oreos for the tacos being dry"}
{"text":"Was pretty good.  Tried 3 different hot dogs.  The house, red, and brown.  No I did NOT eat all three by myself lol.  They were good.  A little salty for my taste but it wasn't horrible.  The fries with their garlic sauce was delicious!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend kept saying that he wanted to try this place. Finally, I caved. There are just certain foods that I am just not a fan of. A big one is hot dogs, but I was going to take the high road and go. I am glad that I did because this place was awesome! 

Service: The customer service was ridiculously good. The guy at the counter was very friendly. Forty minutes before closing, he still talked us through the menu. Even when we were eating he came to check on us and ask if we wanted dessert at 5 til close. You would have thought that we were there midday. 

Food: I'm no hot dog expert, but I really loved the green dog. The churro with the horchata ice cream is one of the best I've had. The ice cream itself is outstanding. The tab selection has one of my favorites -- Xocoveza. (It's chocolate, coffee, vanilla, milk sugar, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon to me. My favorite winter beer!) For my spicy lovers, this is an impressive hot sauce selection that actually has a kick. The dirty fries were fantastic with its cheddar bacon goodness. 

Ambiance: I loved it. Clean, relaxed, and very L.A. I literally have nothing negative to say. For me, that is rare."}
{"text":"Ok so the first thing I noticed the menu item prices were higher than the prices that are posted here on Yelp. You might want to change that....
Other than that, this place is pretty dang amazing. I just hope this place doesn't change and head south like every other place I fall in love with!!!
The staff is super happy, full of energy, polite and hard working! You can see the cooks busting their butts to get your food out fast! And it really does come out fast! The front of house staff is always moving and getting the tables cleans and taking care of customers. 
The music! Omg, if you like old school REAL rap like Tupac and Eminem then you'll love this place. My bestie and I were dancing and singing while eating our amazing eats! 
Good times. 
We had the original dirt dogs, the carne Asada fries, the garlic fries and the dirty esquite! It was heaven!!!! We finished everything but the fries(so heavy but yummy). But we took them to go! Throwing them babies in my over later for a snack! 
Every single thing we are was ahhhhhhmazing!!!!!
Topped off our meal with super delish deep fried Oreos! Omnomnom!!!!
I can't believe I've never seen this place! I'm so in love.... can't wait to try other items on my next visit! And I'm pretty sure that will be real soon!!
Keep up the great work dogs!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go to get your hot dog fix in. Staff was friendly and the food was amazing. I had the green dog and my husband had the house dog. Both were amazing. I loved the guacamole sauce in the green dog. We also tried the dirt chips which were crispy and full of flavor. They only serve craft beers, which my husband loved. Only complaint was the put the wrong buns on the hot dogs, but hopefully it's not a normal thing and the food was still delicious!"}
{"text":"Trendy, as well as tasty. Upbeat music, highly decorated walls, and tagging below the counter make this place fun to be in. The menu has many different style dogs to offer, as well as street tacos, a variety of fries, and dessert options. Open til 11, so you may be able to make it after work (or before you go out)"}
{"text":"Food is great most of the time which is why I gave 3 stars. The green dog is a good option if you can't do spice, and the elote is super tasty. One more drawback is for a hotdog, corn and beer its $17 bucks. I think street food should be at a lower price point, especially since they are an LA concept (where I am from)."}
{"text":"Cashier was super friendly and helpful! 
The food was amazing! Can't wait to come back! :D"}
{"text":"1.5 stars. Second time here, first time they were 'sold out' of veggie dogs so we were turned away. Came back tonight, they have the veggie dog alternative. Got two red dogs and dirty fries, $18. The hot dogs were ridiculously small and nothing special. Pictures were far better. Dirty fries were so so, but again, nothing special. They play music with cuss words, didn't bother me but beware if you have kids. Also, asked my toppings to be extra grilled, and they came out raw. 

     Giving them half a star for offering a veggie alternative, albeit if not 'sold out'. And for the small hot sauce selecetion. Borderline terrible otherwise, especially for the price. You can make 4x as good of hot dogs from your home microwave. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I always like hotdogs... This place has a few versions I've never had. The dogs were good but the toppings added a different dimension to them. I had it topped with chimichurri on a lobster bun which was good. I will try the elote dog next time. 
Place was nice and staff was helpful. Prices are reasonable. Maybe I'll ask them if they can do other combinations next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way to work the other day because they were recognizing first responders and emergency workers.  Thank you for supporting our brave first responders and supporting our community 

Found the staff to be friendly, the service was fast and the food was great. 

Will have to stop back with the wife on day when I'm not on duty for some adult beverages. 

#VegasStrong"}
{"text":"My family loved the food. The elotes were bomb! I'm not a hot dog person but they really changed my mind today lol. Most definitely gonna be a regular!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 4. We got the House Dog, Red Dog and Green Dog.
Mines are the Red Dog and it was good! It's actually pretty spicy for me, so I only recommend this if you really like spicy.

I didn't get to try the others, because they ate it so quickly, lol! 

Staff is friendly. Plenty of seating.

Oh, and they have variety of hot sauces available! Tried the ghost pepper sauce for fun and it killed me XD"}
{"text":"This place is superrr good excellent customer service I order the Corn Dog and the dirt fries all amazing will definitely come back soon Thank you love this place :)"}
{"text":"Had secret menu Patty Melt dog and dirty corn.  Excellent.  Staff very friendly.  Wife had churro, yum You got to try this place.  Really good. Ask about secret menu dogs not on menu for more choices."}
{"text":"Oh my flippin gosh.... Stepping inside, the scent of onion and cilantro welcome you into their warm embrace. It smelled delicious in here!!! The menus were lit, clearly placed, and had high definition photos of each food selection. The cashier was explaining the food to the couple in front of us and was very friendly. 

Food: They have a menu created from the famous LA Street Dog (Los Angeles). Being an LA native, I can attest that those Bacon wrapped hot dogs with grilled onions, mayo, ketchup, mustard is to die for!!! But the Po-Po be chasing them off and the city of Los Angeles bans them!! That's because they were sold by illegal immigrants. This establishment has hot dogs (including a Veggie Dog), but they also have different kinds of fries, as well as Tacos. They even have Jamaica (Hibiscus punch) and Horchata, Coke fountain drinks, AND a BAR! We got a Green Dog, Al Pastor Fries, and an Elote (corn on the cob). AY CHIHUAHA!  DIOS MIO!! My hot dog was in a toasted, warm, buttery lobster roll (you choose the type of roll you want from 3 selections). Flavors were ON POINT. The Al Pastor Fries were my absolute FAVORITE (so far, this was my first visit after all). There were big chunks of pineapple, thick chunks of pork (literally tasted like Chorizo to me), sour cream, cilantro, lime, oh yeah and french fries. And it was enough for 2 people to share! The Elote was delicious! 

Ambiance: It was Urban. Graffiti artwork on the walls, gangsta rap/ West Coast rap/90s hip hop. The cashier was tatted up. The crowd was Urban (mostly minorities) but to my surprise older White people were there too. The restaurant was pretty full and a long line was formed after we sat. 2 big flat screen TVs. Even games to play at your table (cards, Jenga, etc) while you wait. Even the floors had artwork on them. There was a section of a wall full of hot sauces!!! They had my fave brand, Marie Sharps. 

Overall I had a great experience. The only negative was an obnoxious customer snapping pictures of everything. He even asked me to move so he could take a photo of the artwork at the register. OBNOXIOUS. 

I highly recommend this joint, it really embodies LA, the Latin flavors and spirit. It's a very chill place! The cooks were also professionally dressed too, so it is very evident that they take pride in this business and that the Chefs are allowed to create magic."}
{"text":"Wow this place was epic. I tried this place for the first time last weekend and let me tell you the food was AMAZING and the service matched. The workers were all extremely friendly and weren't afraid to joke around w us. Just a fun place with good energy. It was packed when I went but I heard from a few people it's always really busy, goes to show you how bomb the food really is."}
{"text":"Hot dog hot dog hot diggity dog! This awesome place is tucked in the corner so keep an eye out or you'll miss it.

The food is amazing! They have the most creative style menu for hot dogs and tacos! Your taste buds will thank you! 

The restaurant is not that large but is very hip! The counter is right when you open the door so a line can build up quickly. They have board games available like battle ship, monopoly, etc for you to enjoy with friends. The decor of the restaurant has some cool artsy designs on the wall. They are also opened late which is awesome! When I'm having a late night munchies craving this is the place to satisfy my hunger!

The staff is super cool! Very nice and friendly! 

The hot dogs are nice and juicy. I've tried the Elote Dog, Chili Dog, and House Dog! I'm determined to try all the dogs they have! For desert I always get the churro! It's so good when it's warm and fresh! 

Will definitely be back to complete my eat all hot dog mission!"}
{"text":"So good!   Stopped by for lunch-so glad i did.  We got a house dog (minus the peppers & onions) a chili dog, (we had the \"lobster\" buns in both-its actually texas toast made into a bun) salt& pepper fries & garlic fries. Dessert was a fried twinkie and fried oreos that came with horchata whipped cream. We both loved our meal-so much flavor, not your ordinary hot dog!  Would totally recommend this place. Oh-and we got ours to go-the woman helping me packed it up perfectly and was totally pleasant."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place with our kids. We waited 25 minutes for a plain hotdog, fries and 2 house dogs when there was no one else in place. I figured a hotdog place would be quick and easy. Food was OK and employees were nice,  but they seriously need to work on their speed of food service."}
{"text":"Super good food!!....Fair prices and great customer service!!!!..Employees are really positive all about the customers!!!.....If anybody is in Vegas go to Dirt Dog..you will not be dissapointed and you will leave with a full stomach!!!!!....THIS IS MY SHOUTOUT TO DIRT DOG!!!!....KEEP IT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a red dirt dog.  Tasty mofo.  My coworker had a mutt off the secret menu and a corn.  By her moaning and the mess on her face I assume she liked what she had as well."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I ate there today with my Fiancé and it was amazing. I'm surprised it doesn't cost more because the food was so good. They also play classic hip hop and rap, they take the cuss words out though, so the place is family friendly. It's a must go if you haven't had it! I need more stars to rate it! The staff is amazing hard workers too. They have board games and it makes you feel like you are at home and comfortable :) I can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs are good but nothing crazy special. They do offer a lot of options and I really like the fact that they give you the choice between a soy hot dog or a \"real\" one. The soy one tastes just like the real thing and I would never know the difference. 
Although, Their elote in a cup is okay. Every time I've ordered it, it had way too much mayonnaise where I couldn't even finish it. This place is good don't get me wrong, but nothing mind blowing. It's definitely over-hyped & I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"A+ all across the board! 
Atmosphere-clean, modern, fun, and an INCREDIBLE 90s hip hop and rap playlist that killed it! There are cards and board games you can play while you wait but considering how fast they move even when it was busy you won't have much time to kill. 
Service-so friendly, so fast, table was vacated, cleared and wiped down within minutes while we waited to sit. And the place was full!  Each thing we finished was whisked away promptly and politely. I don't see service this terrific even at fancy restaurants. Super impressive. 
Food - this is why the place was PACKED even at 3 pm on a Sunday. So so so great. I will crave this food. The filthy fries are delicious and, for those of us who don't eat beef hot dogs, they have a SOY-BASED HOT DOG you can swap out for the beef dog on any of their dishes. Amazing! Oh yeah, pretty good horchata too :)
I will be back again and again. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Awesome place with great music and a cool vibe. I've been wanting to try this place for a long time, so we went big. We ordered the House Dog, the Mutt Dog, The Chili Dog, filthy fries and the elote corn cup. My favorite was the house Dog with red and green peppers, onions and bacon thousand island. It was superb! We ordered the mutt dog because we couldn't decide between the red or green dog. Next time I will pick one or the other because the clash of flavors was a little much for the palate. Just enough spice. The chili dog was good but not what I was expecting. This place over does it a bit on the cilantro and bacon, but that's just my opinion. I would order it again just cheese onions and chili. The fries were delicious. Crispy fried and they didn't get soggy with all the condiments on top. I was surprised how spicy they were. The corn cup was good but again, I would do without the cilantro and bacon. No room for desert but I would love to try the horchata ice cream mmm. Would definitely recommend Dirt Dog!"}
{"text":"LA is one of my favorite cities for so many reasons. The convenience of getting a street dog out there after events, concerts, games, and even just shopping is just one of them lol. As many times as I tried to re-create the LA dirty dog, alley dog, Tijuana dog, whatever you want to call it, it just doesn't hit the palate the same way. 

Having Dirt Dog just 10 min away has been a great way to suffice my cravings. Honestly, all the hotdog variations we've tried have been really good. I usually go for the one that closely resembles the OG LA dog. We tried their horchata ice cream when they first opened, and omg that was pretty darn amazing. My kids love, love their deep fried Oreos.

One star docked off because of a few things. First of all, the garlic fries sounds so good, but when they come out, they are not that great. I am an eloté fanatic! I'm an original customer of the ones that used to come around my neighborhood in Cali that are sold in carts. The eloté here I feel like is missing some of its authenticity. It's just a little too Americanized. Can't explain but my feelings are real lol. Lastly, for hotdogs, it's pretty pricey. Even for a plain bacon wrapped hotdogs for the kids, it's the same price.

In conclusion, we will continue to come back. We just know what to get and what not to get now. Service has always been great. We love the music played there. Totally our era!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and totally pigged out on delicious food!! I got the Elote Dog, which was perfect with limey goodness and just enough cheese. The filthy fries were sooooo good with guacamole and double cheese!!  I'd definitely recommend for the food, great music and personable service!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to to try this place for the first time. The Service is horrible!!  Walked in no one greeted us whatsoever as we stood there for couple of minutes. Yes, we looked confused not knowing if it's self seated or order first. About 3 min later had one staff member say are you ready to order. My daughter and I said forget this place and walked out. This is definitely a place we will not be trying. First impression and service are everything"}
{"text":"Over priced hot dogs that anyone can make at home. Ordered the green dog, house dog, garlic fries, and the fried Twinkie. Out of everything the only thing I would go back for is the fried Twinkie. The house dog has nothing special and the green dog is like a taco hot dog. The buns are very greasy and so are the fries. Overall I thought there would be more flavor to everything. The Twinkie however is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place! Great food and great workers! Had fried Oreos, I forget the hotdog but it was delicious and carne Asada fries! Super good me and my boyfriend will be back!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs are big, the flavors are huge, but the fries could be a little better. I tried the House Dog and absolutely loved the bacon thousand island dressing. The fries were ok, but I would have loved more seasoning. The only hotdog place in town I think is better than Dirt Dog is Buldogis. Dirt Dog has a very different flavor profile though, more south of the border flavors and that's good it makes them stand out. The food comes out hot and fast and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"If you love bacon wrapped hot dogs, and let's be honest who doesn't, you'll love dirt dogs. I got the chill dog which was fantastic. The lobster bread is a must. I highly suggest this place. This place is definitely the place to get a hot dog if you want one."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, it was our first and last visit. Don't understand the high ratings given on Yelp. Perhaps fake reviews?

Place was empty on Saturday afternoon.  The cashier was rushing us to order while we were trying to review the menu.

Was looking forward to craft beer - they were completely tapped out of all 4 IPA's?!  Ok, water then.

Veggie dog was served to me barely cooked. Sent it back for new one.

Garlic fries were just fries with uncooked dry/hard bits of garlic from a shaker. 

Only item on point was their dirty corn.

Well, we tried this place, looked promising, but won't be returning."}
{"text":"Akeelah is one of the best waitresses here at Dirt Dog. Every time we come in, she brightens our day. We had a problem with one of our meals, and she fixed it immediately. Akeelah is the definition of great service with a smile, they really should give the girl a raise!"}
{"text":"Went to the Rainbow location first time to eat here.  Saturday 4th of March for husbands birthday.  We tried chili, corn and patty dog all 3 where great.  We also got seasoned garlic fry's they where excellent.  Place was clean and friendly.  Liked it so much we came back on Monday 6th March.  We only got the Corn and green dogs with garlic fry's.  I will say still clean and friendly BUT food not even the same.  The dirty corn tasted good but not as good as Sat.  I came back specifically for the garlic fry's.  They where not seasoned, under cooked and raw garlic in a pile on top.  Now that said if that is how they normally are served then my bad.  The person who was cooking on Saturday around 3-4 ish  really knows how to cook and make people come back for more.  Consistency is the key and there was none in the food department."}
{"text":"I'm not a hotdog lover, but the kids begged us when we were on vacation in Vegas.  We went to the Rainbow location.  Everything inside was immaculate... really nice and clean!  We love the artwork, music, and overall feel of it.

Akia at the register was wonderful!  She explained everything on the menu in detail and even gave a few recommendations.  It's only her third day working here, and I truly believe she could teach courses on customer service.

The kids loved their hotdogs and fries.  My son even ate all of his and most of mine!  (Again, I'm not a hotdog person.)  The only downsides were that there's mayo on the hotdogs, which wasn't listed on the menu.  There were also two menus next to the door that we didn't see: one for street tacos and taco fries.  Had we seen them, we might have ordered those instead.  We were so focused on the main menu on the wall, though, that we didn't see the other two menus behind us.

The food came out incredibly fast!  We were barely seated when the food came out hot & fresh.  After eating, we decided to order some of the goodies we initially missed.  We got a street taco (DELICIOUS) and the fried Oreos and a churro.  All were absolutely outstanding, piping hot and fresh!

We grownups will definitely come back for the street tacos and desserts, and the kids obviously loved their hotdogs.  The only tip I have is that if there are any foods that are off limits for you (like mayo) ask before ordering.  Not all ingredients are posted in the food descriptions.  Great place overall!!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've lived in LA and I often crave the hot dogs I used to get at the swap meet. Dirt Dog hit the spot. It was kind of pricey for hot dogs but the place was clean and bright and the food tasted fresh. The only downside was that my niece's chili dog took the entire visit to be made. They ran out of chili and had to make up a whole new batch. It was a Tuesday around 6PM so it does seem a bit like poor planning to run out at that time. However, the cashier came by to apologize and they were very considerate of us. Definitely looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The Hot dogs at this place are very enjoyable and reasonably priced. It is gourmet hot dogs not your typical Polish dogs from Costco so you should expect to pay a little bit more. The servers were very nice and friendly, once you have finished placing your order, pick a table and they will bring the food to you.  I really enjoyed the food, but I wish they had a little bit more variety to choose from. The hotdog was huge, and the toppings really added to the flavor. The only thing I didn't quite enjoy was the dirty corn esquite elote because it was a lot smaller than what was pictured."}
{"text":"I'll try it again sometime maybe. Not right away though. 15$ for a dog, fries, and drink, geez...."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and great customer service. Must try if your in the area! Wide range of choice to satisfy everyone from anywhere. I love this place. Don't expect a short line because they are booming but its 100% well worth the time!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend elote dog & elote fries. Filthy fries were amazing as well!! Great and friendly service, clean & welcoming atmosphere. Board games available to play & 90s hip hop music playing. Love this place"}
{"text":"Best hot dog I ever had in my life lol sounds funny but it's true , different styles such as the elotes dog aka Mexican corn , my favorite , amd not just hot dogs but good street tacos and heaven sent deep fried Oreos seriously a must try !"}
{"text":"It was a Friday night in Vegas! We had  just had an early dinner but we left room to try this place. 

When we came in, there was already a line of people. Order what kind of dogs that you want at the counter. 

I ordered the red dog with the elote covered with spicy crumbles Cheetos. My husband ordered the Mutt Dog ( half and half red and green dog ).

This was the best hot dog We have ever had so far! It was so different. Topped with some grilled onions, red chilies and roasted jalapeños. You can choose what kind of bun you want. 

The elote was very good also. The corn itself cooked so perfectly, nice texture and watery. Covered with all the yummy thing, it was so so good! 

This place was a full house that night! Not a really big place so get your seat as fast as you can. 

Service from the server was very nice. This guy called my husband to give him 2 cups to go for our leftover coke. Oh how I wish they have one in Reno!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com elote dog and the flaming hot Cheeto elote. Even cooler is that the staff is exactly what you don't expect from a place like this or any other fast casual spot. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, not some stupid kid that knows nothing on their phone tapping away with a hat on backwards.

A+ I'll be back soon keep it up!"}
{"text":"I think this is first 5 stars i have given. When i entered i was so skeptical it was so busy and you havr to wait in line to order. I dodnt have a nice table and it was self seating. I was tired hungry and drove from north laa vegas toneat there. However a booth opened up and everything changed our food was delivered and for a hot dog and fried i was in heaven. I had a red dog found out all doga are bacon wrapped! I love the bacon. Carni asada fries regular fried 2 tacos and a dr. Pepper. All the food was so fresh. The wait staff was awesome checking in several times making sure we were happy and our needs met. I honestly dont think i gave a 5 star review and im shocked itnwas so much more than a hot dog stand. Good job to all at dirt dogs and i suspect you will see me again."}
{"text":"Kept seeing Facebook posts and videos about this place so decided to go and check it out with the family.  Three adults and a teenager cost about $60 with tip.  We got four hotdogs, two corns, elote fries, two tacos and four drinks (2 fountain, 2 Mexican cokes).  After eating decided on getting the horchata ice cream (very good)!  The hotdogs were pretty good.  Two of us got the lobster bun (50 cents extra) and the other two normal buns.  As for the corn, never as good as the elote man but still yummy. I got the dirty corn and my daughter wanted the hot Cheeto version with nothing on top.  The elote fries were interesting and good.  Moving on to why I only gave it a four star... the two tacos had a hair in it.  The waitress brought the manager over and they kindly refunded the two tacos on the card and made us two more. Other than that mishap... all and all was a nice restaurant and friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"This place is very cool atmosphere. Kinda like a food truck vibe but inside. The downside is there is no guarantee of a seat which isn't the best. We went in and for 15 mins there was no tables available because it's self seating so we almost didn't eat there because of that. I do love there french fries! Sooo sooo good!!! I love that they have vegan dogs too! And the price for them is not that bad. Their churros are pretty good!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice variety ... tacos, dogs, & loaded French fries! The one on Blue Diamond kinda has a fifties dinner feel to the place. The only issue I got with the place is where the line is. It should not be by the main entrance. They might want to think about moving to a bigger place or making one in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best dogs in Vegas, hands down!!  If this place had a different name and location, there would be a line out the door."}
{"text":"Elote dog 
Bacon & cheese dog (??) 

Amazing food and quick service!!! Very satisfying!! Ugh! Would return!!"}
{"text":"The House Dog (highly recommend)
The Mutt dog (flavor was a bit off)
Filthy Fries (recommend but they change the type of fries they use)
Churros (wasn't crispy at all, way over dusted with cinnamon, would not order again)"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food, amazing desserts, and the best service. They really know how to take care of you here. S/O to Amber who really went above and beyond to treat us way better than what was expected. Definitely going to be a regular here. #GetDirty"}
{"text":"Everything was really good. Hot dogs are delicious, corn was amazing, and my bf got chili cheese fries that he really liked. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great great great great!!!!!!!!!! Phenomenal  food can't complain and the cashier was awesome came in at 11 o'clock in the afternoon. Can't remember her name but she was great!"}
{"text":"New favorite place...first off I got a speeding ticket on my way here but in the end it was well worth it plus I got a free beer from that story lol. Everyone was nice for real Tiffany Tiana Jayden all mvp's. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu! 5 star! Service 5 star! Plus board games!! And beer!!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place, got our order to-go. The red veggie hot dog was good, and so was the corn. However, when I bit into my churro, I noticed a long, black hair (about 6-7 inches long) stuck to my churro (looks like it got fried on during the cooking process). I immediately spit it out. Won't be going back here to dine again."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Great food, excellent selection.  Definitely a great reminder of Los Angeles street food."}
{"text":"Had the elote corn on the cob twice and both times tasted like the corn was boiled the previous day. Dogs were just so so. They boast of street food in Los Angeles......not even close!! 
Will try again and hope for the best."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I had hot dogs. Where I lived before there wasn't any place that was worth trying. 

Dirt Dog got my attention though. Bacon wrapped hot dogs? Yes please!

After finishing a training session, I came straight here to refuel. Simple menu, friendly staff, and orders come out pretty quick. I got the house dog and garlic fries.

The house dog was probably one of the best hot dogs I have been blessed to try. Nice and meaty hot dog on a delicious toaster bun with bacon, green chili, thousand island dressing, and grilled onions. Some of my favorite hot dogs were just ketchup, mustard, and crushed potato chips, so this is a good departure from that.

The garlic fries were good. I was expecting more garlic, as it was more like regular fries for me. I would probably try another topping next time.

Overall, I really enjoyed the hot dog and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Wifey and I just had a couple \"House Dogs\" along with Garlic Fires and Fitlhy Fries.  It was fantastic!  I love hot dogs in general but this was by far the best I've ever had.  The food, the atmosphere, the friendly service, cleanliness.. it's all above standard and we will definitely recommend and be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome!
Dirt Dog has been on my bookmarks for quite some time now and I finally got to check it off my list. My husband and I ate here and we had a good experience. We came in, looked at their menu, and ordered at the register. The lady that helped us was really nice and helpful. I was surprised that they served tacos, since it was a hotdog joint but their tacos were pretty good. I would recommend getting the elote dog and a carne Asada taco."}
{"text":"If you like hot dogs then you will looooove this place. If you like Mexican corn then this is the only place you should come!  Not to mention all the old school hip hop playing while you're eating. I will back fo sho!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out for lunch. I'm not a particularly adventurous eater so most of the menu wasn't appealing to me but they did have a plain hot dog option which I took (same price as all of their others though). My husband got the chili dog and loved it. We also ordered the garlic fries which were good. 

The seating is a little odd with about half barstool and half with normal tables. 


From my husband:
I can honestly say they have one of the best chili dogs I have had since moving back to the west. 
I hope it does well there is also one on the strip in front of Ballys!!

So in short, my husband will be back but I won't. Overpriced for my limited taste buds."}
{"text":"Wow oh wow this is a hidden hole in the wall that totally reminds me of home! ( I'm from LA) it's like getting a hot dog from a street vendor after a long night of dancing my butt off except kicked up like ten knotches!!!!  It's a really weird location so if you don't know what to look for it you would never see it! Plus they play amazing music! It was nothing but West Coast hip-hop from Tupac, Snoop, Dre and a few others sprinkled in there! I got the Elote Dog and the patty melt dog! Yum and for desert a fried Twinkie and homemade churro! Plus they have Cherry Coke on fountain! Nobody ever has cherry Coke! I can't wait to take all the people I know to this gem!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Their hotdogs are delicious with lots of flavor and variety! Definitely a must try if you haven't been here."}
{"text":"Update: I went back tonight and I'm happy to report that my first review did not do this place justice. My reasons are below. I do want to note, in the interest of full disclosure, that Timothy (owner) did invite me back but the food was so good this time around that I offered to pay (twice!). It says a lot about a business when the owner is willing to stand by his product. So thanks for hosting me Timothy and let's get into it!

1) House Dog- I tried this on my last visit and wasn't sold on the lobster roll bun. This time I opted for the Portuguese bread and what a difference! It was toasted perfectly and it stood up to the sauces... home run! 

2) Al Pastor Fries- I'm pleased to report that the seasoning on the fries has been adjusted and is no longer overly salty! I did prefer the Al Pastor over the Asada fries from my last visit. One suggestion: if they were to leave the meat on the grill just a little longer so it gets that nice char this would be perfection! 

3) Dirty Esquite- this was reason I wanted to come back! I had never tried it with a bit of lime or bacon. It was different but quite tasty! The change elevates street food nicely. 

4) Horchata Ice Cream & Churro- this is the stuff dreams are made of! I'm still kicking myself for not trying this on my first visit. The ice cream has the perfect balance of sweetness to the vanilla. It's topped with puffed rice and almonds for crunch. The warm churro as a contrast is golden and delicious.  If they sold the ice cream in pints, I would buy it!"}
{"text":"Where do I start??? This place is AMAZING! The elotes, garlic fries, chili fries and patty melt dog was soooo good!! 

My husband stopped eating just to write his review and I followed  

This was our first visit but definitely not our last! 

Fresh, hot and very flavorful"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Dirty chili dog and horchata ice cream was bomb.  I especially love that they have beer on tap.  Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious. The bacon wrapped hot dog selection was good and unique. We even got a free ice cream for National Hot Dog Day: )"}
{"text":"Damn good dogs and fries and beers served with a smile was a perfect combo on a Sunday afternoon at this clean establishment In vegas.

The server was on point and hustling on late Sunday afternoon and he was genuinely concerned with guests about the quality of his service and the product and made it a pleasant experience so thank you and great job..and I'll be back soon for some more - chili dog, red dog, chili fries, elote corn in a cup with some modelo brews and some ice cream with churro and banana was a AWESOME late lunch and I'll be back upon my next visit to vegas baby...!!!...."}
{"text":"Really unique combinations and it taste great. Wish there were more options though but it's a good place to get some gourmet hotdogs. The dessert definitely look good and the chili fries is awesome and pretty filling."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome dogs; way, way understaffed.

Tried the veggie, mutt, house, and red dogs. Overall, the dog itself is flavorful, meaty, juicy, and it's got that great bite that makes hot dogs so great. And the dog is wrapped in bacon, but it doesn't interfere with the bite at all; just makes a crunchy, juicy, fatty wiener. Absolutely delicious.

They're stuffed with toppings, but not overfilled. Get the lobster bun; really buttery and soft to go with the hot, savory dog within. The toppings are reminiscent of the Chiptole fajita mix, with that grilled, mild Mexican flair.

RED DOG: This thing packs a very spicy punch. You can see the red pepper flakes lining every inch; really spicy but not excessively tongue-burning. I thought it was just right. There's a nice dressing/sauce underneath the wiener that brings the whole scrumptious thing together.

MUTT DOG: Tons of stuff going on here. Gotta get the lobster bun to sop up all the sauce coming underneath. It's got the heat of the red dog, with more spicy tomato sauce from the green dog part. The guac paired very nicely with the heat.

HOUSE DOG: Meh, what you'd expect from a hot dog with all of those toppings. Nothing crazy, not particularly memorable. Stick with the red/green/mutt.

The garlic fries were the bomb. Garlic for days. Their fries are really crispy and salty, but the garlic sauce just takes it to another level. A must-try.

The dirty corn is also great. If you're into carnival/fair style corn on the cob, make sure to get one of these. 

This is a genuine competitor for Vegas' best dog with Windy City and Bulgogi's. Vegas hot dog lovers, meat lovers, food lovers alike: put Dirt Dog next on your foodie bucket list."}
{"text":"Soooooo.....yummy!!!!!! Definitely have to come here and get the corn! Eli was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Wow !!! This is the first expensive hot dog I've had, $7.43 for just one dog.  Yes, it was good but NOT worth the price.  It was a decent size dog(hoping it was longer) I was still hungry after it..hehe!!

Got the mutt dog, it's  and very flavorful.. I squeezed the  on and it tasted better.  I like the sauté onion and peppers as well.  Still doesn't justify $7.."}
{"text":"Super good, enjoyed the experience as well, they had games you could bring to the table and play, oh and they served beer which I was surprised about, who doesn't like beer with their dog?"}
{"text":"Everything was good, but is to pricy for the kind of food they serve........ Como on guys you are serving hot dogs and fries !!!!!!"}
{"text":"The hotdogs were good! From our first visit, it was a very filling hotdog. My husband and kids got the chili dog, I got the mutt dog. Lots of ingredients went on both kinds of hotdogs. If you like hotdogs that are big, hot, and full of ingredients, then Dirt Dog is the place.
Positives: the food didn't take long to come out. They have some board games on the side that you can play at your table. It's a nice change from seeing video poker machines to play, and our kids had fun playing Candy Land. Our fries were good to; we had the sea salt and black pepper, and the chili cheese fries. Lots of toppings again on the chili cheese fries, and the fries stayed hot and crispy. 
Negatives: the one front door is the only door to come in and out, and is about ten feet from the register so there is a huge cluster when there is more then two people in line and others are trying to leave. The music, very classic R&B/rap  but super loud ! One thing that did bother us was the chili cheese fries came out, then three minutes later the Sea salt and pepper fries came out, then five minutes later the hotdogs came out. Why the staggered food delivery?! And keeping up with cleaning the tables is always a must anywhere. My husband was upset that he sat down and the lady started cleaning tables and didn't offer to wipe down the table he was sitting at. 
So far, 3 stars! Based all together on the food and service. We will be coming back, to try something different"}
{"text":"Super big fat, juicy beef hot dog omg the patty melt dog is my fav it's a big fat dog on a Texas toast style bun + wrapped in center cut bacon, topped with bacon cheddar fries and chiptole aioli spread. yeah you have to see the pics to believe me. This is not a chain, this is a young entrepreneurs place that I hope everyone visits. Not only to keep small business alive but this is super great, real food. It's pricey - we had two dogs, two drinks and a side of fries and a side of corn it was $30 but for sure worth it, very tasty and unique!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. I do wanna say that the customer service was on point! The girl that was working the register had a great attitude and helped us with all kinds of questions. That's pretty much why they got three stars out of me. 

The food...le sigh...I wasn't that excited. It tasted alright. My husband ordered The Green Dog and it was flavorful but the bread was pretty hard. I ordered the Dirty Chili Dog and it was ehh...nothing out of the ordinary. I did order it with the lobster bread which if you do decide to try out this place I recommend trying the hot dogs with the lobster bread! Makes it much more better. We also ordered garlic fries and BOY did I regret it. I felt like I was eating the whole clove of garlic. Waaaaay to much. 

I loved the atmosphere there. Very laid back. Would I return again...honestly no. Even though they were very friendly and customer service was great but the food wasn't so great."}
{"text":"Dirt dog is one of the better hot dog joints in Vegas. We came pretty late at night since our first choice wasn't possible to eat at, at the time.  I ordered the elote dog, and the fried Twinkie.  The elote dog was very messy, and all the flavors on the hot dog were over powering and I couldn't find myself able to eat the whole thing in one go.  I would rather eat an elote, and have the hot dog on the side.  The dessert I got was very nice, what you would find at a fair basically.  
My partner got the green dog, and I loved that one a lot more.  It tasted perfect and not over empowering at all.  
The staff is very nice, the wait was a little long and there was no where to sit.  The place has games you can play, you can sit at tables or at table-bars.  We ate in the car though. 
Overall, I would definitely go back/recommend, but I would not get the elote dog or recommend it to anyone else. I would go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Delicious dogs. Delicious corn. This place is the best. You've gotta keep your eye out for it because it's kind of hidden."}
{"text":"I DID NOT Like it ...
I LOVEEEED IT!!! not being a dirty lady... I was praying while driving for them to not tell me \" sorry we sold out \" 
The young lady helped us with our order. She recommended 
1- red dog
1- patty melt
1- green dog (with chimichurri Yum)
1- Mutt dog
my husband calm me down with my excitement  so i had only 2 dogs and half 
silly thing the cup they give you for your fountain drink is a clear cup what make your soda more flavorful in my opinion... Like that 
We got treated like Royals! Truly!
they offer us a churro because last time we came they ran out of hot dogs (now they know black friday = MORE dirt dogs people )
the churro was very soft and yummy
THANK YOU for this great dinner and experience
you will see us again, we live around the corner"}
{"text":"service was 4 out of 10.
didnt feel warm and welcome as a new comer at all.
their dogs are overpriced and overrated. probably on lly delicious in the state it originally was born in? ?"}
{"text":"Had the elote dog. Basic ingredients. Not too much flavor. Hot dog was rubbery and dry. Had elote fries and the overwhelming burnt taste ruined the dish. Ordered nuggets for my daughter yet they were completely burnt to where you can smell it. They should change their oil or pay attention to fryer more. Got a refund for her little meal. Ordered fried Twinkie and churro which were good though. Wouldn't recommend this place. Lots of nice advertising of their food but the quality wasn't there. Waiter who brought our food, young Asian kid was sincere and showed his concern when I showed him the burnt kids food. He offered to remake it but we had already waited 25 minutes and I felt bad she had to wait again. Ended up leaving unhappy but appreciative of the servers concern. Family and I won't be returning to Dirt Dog, would rather take the drive to Los Angeles for a real Dog. Wish I would of took pics of the nuggets but i was too concerned to feed my kid and rushed that dish back to the server. If you look closely at my elote dog you can see how dry it is, the hotdog itself is shrunken at the end."}
{"text":"Expensive but good dogs. Looking to try a different style hot dog then this is the place. Worth trying once."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this establishment. Went to the location in Vegas near Bally's. Was so excited to eat here but there menu in store did not reflect the same menu they have online. Wanted to order the veggie dog which is on their site and when they said they don't have it they proceeded to ask me if I wanted a beef one instead. I'm pretty sure if your asking for a veggie dog, you most likely don't eat beef!"}

\"The Mutt Dog / Elote Fries\"
POGIBALLS overall rating 4 Stars
Food 4 1/2 Stars
Service 4 Stars
Restaurant Cleanliness 4 Stars
Restroom 4 Stars

     The mutt dog came out well prepared and well cooked.  The assortment of peppers and spices were the perfect amount, and the dog was not too spicy but was just the right amount of spice. The elote fries were also very well prepared. The amount of corn and elote cheese were the perfect amount for the amount of fries that were in the serving.
     The Establishment was clean and the restroom is also nice and kept. The service was right on point and I got my order right away.

     I would dine in here again."}
{"text":"Food is okay, kinda innovative/fusion  Too many add ons , it's alright but nothing spectacular. The service or rather the food come takes awhile before they bring the food to your table.This place too got loud teenagers music. It's like , what's that ?"}
{"text":"First time here and love the atmosphere Anisha made us feel welcome, the food is on point definitely coming here again ..."}
{"text":"Awesome dogs friendly service and well portion. Staff young but polite and professional"}
{"text":"The food was great, atmosphere was nice and the staff was friendly. However, the layout of the place could be redesigned. You order right when you walk in so when this place is busy (seems like it is a constant flow of people) there's very limited room for people waiting to order and can be become crammed. Also, there's not a whole lot of seating areas for a place so popular, I would have loved for this place to have had a patio to sit at. On nice days/evenings it would be cool to have a patio option. Other than the layout, this place is great."}
{"text":"The taste is so great it hurts, literally almost bit my tongue off chowing down! Haha, but on a serious note the food is never a disappointment. My review last year did not concern the food at all. This restaurant has some of the most delectable flavors. So amazing that I have made it a goal, to try everything on the menu. The team behind concocting these flavors are brilliant period. I would put money behind this awesome place."}
{"text":"How the heck can a hot dog be this good?  

I mean, seriously.  It's like a whole new level of hot dog.  Unfailingly delicious and innovative toppings elevate these bacon wrapped dogs to heights heretofore unimagined.  Best sellers are the Red Dog and the Green Dog.  But why pick one or the other?  You can get both by ordering a Mutt.  Aye, that's the stuff!

You've gotta get the Dirty Chips.  They're dusted with just the right amount of seasoning.  Be SURE to try house made spicy ketchup.  They've got ranch, too, of course.  Woooo!

Chef Joana remembered me from my first visit.  I told her I've been jonesing for one of her Dirt Dog's ever since my last visit in July.  She made me a Mutt Dog that just couldn't be beat.  

The location of Dirt Dog is sort of off the beaten path, but don't let that stop you from visiting.  This place is well worth the drive.  Dirt Dog doesn't disappoint!

Mikey C says: Love me some Dirt Dog!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out since I was in the area. I ordered a Mutt Dog and the Dirty Corn. The hot dog was super juicy and pretty tasty as well, although I did enjoy the Red Dog side more than the Green Dog. I loved the Portuguese roll and wish other hog dog places would use it as their bread as well! It was soft, chewy, slight crisp on the outside, and had just a hint of sweetness to balance out the saltiness of the hot dog. The line was also a nice touch since I added some of their extensive collection of hot sauces. They have so many types and it was definitely hard to choose! The one I pick was SUPER spicy though, and my mouth was on fire after a few drops. Fair warning to those who dare to try. The only complain I had about the Mutt Dog was the lack of toppings. I had a measly five or six slices of onion and I wish there were more. 

For the Dirty Corn, I found it just okay. The corn was fresh and sweet, but there wasn't enough char. The few bites I had with the char were phenomenal and I just wish it was on the grill a bit longer. The toppings didn't taste very traditional to me, probably because of the lack of chili powder that I usually love to sprinkle generously on. The taste improved a lot with a spritz of lime.

My friend ordered a House Dog with an order of Garlic Fries, which she enjoyed. Overall I would give this place 4 out of 5 stars. The food was pretty tasty but would be greatly improved with more toppings. The ambiance was nice- kinda had a sports bar feel with a touch of urban and edgy. Something that also knocked down the rating was the weird storage area near the bathrooms in the back of the restaurant. It was a bit off putting to see and took away from the clean interior feel."}
{"text":"I saw this place as being a suggestion on Instagram, saw all the great reviews and decided to try it. Walked in today (Sunday) and line wrapped around the bar. I figured since their menu was pretty small it wouldn't take that long to order. We spent 20 minutes in line just to order the food. Then stood for another 10 minutes waiting for an employee to clear and clean the tables so we could have a seat. Seating was very limited and cramped. After another 5 minutes we got our fries and another 5 mins after that we got our hot dogs. The toppings on the hot dogs were original and I've never had anything like them, but it wasn't worth the 40 minute overall wait time. Portuguese rolls were the best part of the hotdog. The employees were friendly but didn't have much pep in their step in terms of cleaning and getting the food out. We had to get napkins to re clean the seats after the employee came and wiped them down. The bathrooms were not clean. As I stated before, the majority of the tables weren't cleaned the entire time we had been waiting in line and we still had to wait for them to be cleaned after we ordered. Just a personal preference: it would have been nice to hear some music other than Tupac, maybe NWA or something else.... change it up a little."}
{"text":"Great spot. House dog full of flavor and amazing, chrros and the horchata whip...BoMB!"}
{"text":"Took my son here for lunch and it was great. The food, music, and service was excellent. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch here and all I can say is AMAZING!!! Everything is made fresh to order. Try the lobster bread option with your hot dog and DONT skip out on the horchata ice cream that comes with a churro. Best ice cream we have ever had and that was made in house too! The staff were ALL friendly and informative. They were happy we were loving the food! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place because I was craving for some elote and searched it on yelp. It took chee burger's place so I was familiar with the area. Let me just say, the house dog was AMAZING. Every little thing they put into it went together so well! And their \"dirty corn\" which is similar to elote, satisfied my craving. It's basically the same thing. Literally heaven in my mouth. I definitely had to hit up the gym after though. Haha  I just wish they had more choices of hot dogs on their menu. Or maybe a customize option. That would be cool. Lol"}
{"text":"This place was alright. I felt that there were too much hyped before I went with all the reviews and pictures. I had the red dog and the elote fries. The dog was a bit dry for my taste and the fries was meh. I didn't think there was anything special for this place. The best thing of the place is the toast (lobster style). You must specify for that if you wanted that instead of the regular bun. As for the price, it seems fair (about $6.75) for each regular dog. It's worth a try but I've tasted better hot dog."}
{"text":"These are the best hot dogs I have ever put in my pie hole!! Taste is off the charts, fries are fantastic, didn't try dessert (will next time, looked great). They played a soundtrack I would happily play in my car (classic 90s rap)! Great service on top of everything else...

The only complaint that I would have is that the prices are a little expensive."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious food! I had the Brown Dog, garlic fries, and deep-fried Oreos. My stomach thanked me, for sure! :)"}
{"text":"The best hot dogs I have eaten in Las Vegas!!it was so worth it going all the way to the other side of town. I wanted to try all the different salsas but couldn't lol, my mouth was on fire after the third salsa lol.Customer service is great, can't remember the name of the guy that took our order and took our  food to the  table , he was a really cool and nice guy! Good music too by the way, the place is super cool and chill,I will be back soon!:)"}
{"text":"Not like your typical hot dog! They really bring the hot dog game to another level! Love the varieties choice of hot dog. I ordered the #browndog. Delicious! Me and hubby shared a fries as well. Love how they tossed the fried with seasoning then topped it off with cheese, sour cream, some meat and onion as I remember. (sorry I don't know the name of the fries). They also served beer as well. 
Very helpful staff as well. Will be back and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is the bomb.com n klean place great lil hang out recommend it to everyone i will be back nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"So far the best hot dogs in Vegas.  They have a good variety of dogs on their menu. Thier staff was friendly."}
{"text":"UPDATE: gave these guys a second chance. Finally got to try the elote dog. Highly recommend getting a fork coz it gets messy. It was good but my top favorite is still the green dog and my hubby loves the red dog. I got to try the horchata ice cream/churro as well. Incredible service from Sheena. The other servers were kind & periodically asked if we needed anything. Thanks for putting the line controller so that way, the front door is not blocked anymore."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Disneyland churros, I got excited that this new place hailing from LA had one of their own. It truly was delicious - light and fluffy on the inside, and even the leftover was delicious the next day after warming it in the toaster. Unfortunately, I never got to taste the cream dip that was supposed to go with it. Kudos to the gal up front for being so very friendly and welcoming. And working the register and serving everyone is likely overwhelming. But she gave my order to the customer who came after me. I waited about 15 min for garlic fries and a churro, mind you. That customer luckily came back because we ordered different foods. But the dipping sauce I received..probably was meant for her hot dog and not my churro since it was a spicy dip. So...friendly place, some kinks to work out, but what new business doesn't have that."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for hot dogs. I get one or three every time I go to Costco or Sams Club.

That said, I'm willing to pay more than $6 for a gourmet dog!!  This place is so good. I really could eat 3 in a sitting (and have, when my daughter and her little friend take two bites of theirs and I get to finish, haha)!!  So far, my fav is the red dog. I hate mayo or creamy things so I always forgo the aioli. 

The garlic fries are super good too. I remember when Gordon Biersch was the only place I could find garlic fries. My, how times have changed!

I looooove the elote cups!  As much as I love Mexican street corn (without mayo barf), eating it in public whilst maintaining my lady like status is damn near impossible (I'm totally kidding; I'm not lady like esp if you've seen me with a Five Guys burger). But the cup of corn with the same stuff without having to eat off the Cobb is really what dreams are made of. Who has two thumbs and is giving this place two thumbs way up? This guy!"}
{"text":"Great food, portion could be a little bigger. Filthy fries are my favorite, churro & dipping sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Oh man! This place is FIRE First of all, the service is INCREDIBLE! They have so many choices from the buns to the fries. Also, have tacos! Yes, yum. The food is delicious. I will definitely be back. And I live across town. Yaaaaas"}
{"text":"Walking in i was a little worried. But after tasting my bacon wrapped dog #thehousedog it was delicious. I now understand why the line was so long when we walked in and why it maintained its length during our lunch. I gotta bring my friends here one day."}
{"text":"I don't normally like hot dogs, but this place was amazing! The food was great, so was the customer service, and I loved the atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING and the very definition of FOOD PORN. If you feel like taking foody porn pics on your phone for Instagram, this is a good spot to go for photos AND for great food.

This place primarily focuses on hot dogs so if you're a hot dog fan like me, you've come to the right place my friend. They have a variety of different dogs you can choose from. My personal favorite is the Red Dog but you really can't go wrong with any of them.

While their hot dogs are widely celebrated, their tacos are underrated and also very tasty. I always order one hot dog and taco because ordering just one doesn't quite fill me up. I admit the food takes a while to come out but once it does your patience will be rewarded!

Solid choice for lunch, you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. I definitely liked their fries and dogs. The corn was a bit too much for me but I had eaten a lot of food already. :)  I am glad I finally got to check them out though I'm not sure I'd go too often as it's so tempting and fattening."}
{"text":"So I thought to myself, \"How exciting can a hotdog exactly be?\" It turns out you can do some amazing things to....a hotdog. This is so far my favorite hotdog joint here until I find another one and I don't think it'll happen anytime soon. I recommend the Green Dog and Dirty Chili Fries."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am enjoying. West coast rap plays in the background, food is delivered quickly and with a smile and as Anthony Bourdain would say \"I love my meat in tube form\". I ordered #thehousedog on a lobster roll, and dirty chips as my side all good. I almost forgot to mention beer is available. Let me get back to my food my belly is calling me."}
{"text":"This place was very clean and loved the environment. The staff was very friendly but not much help with suggestions or anything (so make sure you know what you want). The food was ok, but in my opinion kinda pricy (social media hyped it up), I had higher expectations. Paid about $25 for just 2 hotdogs, fries and a drink."}
{"text":"Delicious Hot Dog overall! Happy to see variety come to Vegas for sure! Now on to my experience- I had the Elote Dog, a must have from all the envious pictures that I've seen craving this place! I loved the juicy dog and the crunchy \"Lobster Roll\" bun. The elote corn was lightly sweet and tangy from the slice of lime that accompanied. I will say that the sauce on this dog already has lime in it making the dog just a tad bit over-limey. BUT Still a great lunch/dinner spot! I can't wait to come back and try dessert next time! Thanks Dirt Dog! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Real good food dogs are great!
Could do without all the rap music..
Mau have to order food to go next time.."}
{"text":"This was an excellent go to for a quick bite to eat, the staff was friendly and courteous, the hot dog was sensational and the wings out of this world. We had dinner and bought more wings for the road. The girls definitely know their product they gave us two wings for free and my husband and I left with a dozen for later. Definitely a must try if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was terrible. Didn't think hot dogs could be so bad. Was expecting a better quality hot dog with better quality toppings. We did love the family games at the tables though!"}
{"text":"Ok , so I saw the great reviews had to try it out. My gf, daughter & I got a mutt dog, red dog & dirty fries & kids meal with chicken nuggets. 
Red dog & mutt dog were so spicy we couldn't finish half probably due to the fact it looked like the red pepper shaker broke & opened while making it. Seriously about 4 tablespoons of red pepper flakes on a hot dog. Kind of a let down when they are $6.25 a hot dog. (Keep in mind a in n out burger is $3) Fries were pretty basic \"spicy ketchup\" was ketchup & tobasco. Kids meal was also a let down $7, 5 frozen nuggets & fries with oreos. Service was attentive & knew the menu which is why it got 3 stars. My suggestion include fries with dogs & make meal $7."}
{"text":"Elote fries and fried Oreos were BOMB. However the tacos were horrible. Kind of over priced. Still giving a 4 for the fries/Oreos."}
{"text":"The elote dog is crazy good! They have a great selection I'm so happy I stumbled upon this place. I wish the signage was a little better from the road I almost missed it."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food!! Thanks to Anisha and the lady with the short hair at the register (sorry forgot her name).  My business partner had never had Jamaica so she offered to let us so taste it first!  They went above and beyond to make sure is picky and particular diners had an rave-worthy dining experience.  Too many good choices to choose from on the menu.  We ended up getting the patty melt dog and dirty corn!! Both were amazing! The lobster roll is definitely worth the extra $0.50. I had horchata and my friend ended up having the Jamaica! The only thing I left disappointed about was the fact that I didn't leave room for dessert lol!! We'll definitely be back...I can't wait to bring the family!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on elote. That's right. Corn. And it's bomb.

The end."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with the family on a Sunday afternoon! The staff is very friendly, we were greeted as soon as we walked in (that's always appreciated)! The food is delish! Good vibes for sure! We definitely appreciated Akia's customer service! (Not sure if that's how you spell her name lol)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Definitely make sure you stop by for at least a hotdog and some fries.The establishment was very clean and organized. Sean was our host and he went well out of his way to make sure my visit went as smoothly as possible. He even recommended a few choices over others based on my favorite types of foods. Staff regularly checked to make sure my table wasn't cluttered devoured food baskets and would kindly ask if everything was going well. They even had a wall full of a variety of hot sauces for customers to choose from. The hotdogs and orders of fries we had were top notch and full of delicious flavors. I'll absolutely be coming back as a regular."}
{"text":"My only qualm is with myself and why, WHY in the 6 years I lived in LA did I not eat here sooner!!! My dad and I took a little Vegas vacay and this was seriously the highlight of the trip. We happened to be off the strip and in looking for a lunch spot and this popped up. They had me at bacon hot dogs, because they're absolutely magical. Anyone who disagrees hates puppies, babies, and rainbows.
I had the elote dog and the dirty fries. I almost cried tears of joy if the dessert didn't dry them instantaneously. Dad still talks about it to this day. Anytime we sit down to eat he sighs and says, \"how good would a dirt dog be right now.\" and looks at his food so forlornly it's almost sad.

Thanks dirt dog.  I think you broke my dad. Lol."}
{"text":"My son wanted to try this place, so I decided to take the long drive. First impression: Seeing Tupac everywhere (looove). I didn't know the origin of the place. The cashier was polite, informative, adorable and let me know \"what was up\" with all the Tupac pics and music (Dirt Dog was based out of LA). Next, I saw a vegetarian dog option, so that was a plus. The only thing I'd ask if it is possible to have a vegan bun option in the future. I'm not sure if the frank was vegan (no animal products) or vegetarian (possibly eggs or milk in the ingredients). Are the fries cooked in veggie oil? I had the Salt and Pepper fries, which were hot, crisp and amazing. 
If I come by again (it's so far from me lol), I am going to try the vegan tacos. I'm kind of shocked at some of the negative reviews. If I ate meat, I'd be tearing the crap out of the other dogs. smh."}
{"text":"Perfectly perfect chilli dog's!!! The fries were just amazing, would definitely recommend this place and ofcourse go back for when my randoms cravings kick in."}
{"text":"More than five stars for the dirt dogs. Cooked to perfection!!! My new favorite place !!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great!! My husband and I love hot dogs and dirty dogs from LA so this felt like a little piece of LA. I got the house dog I think it was called. It was good, to me it wasn't anything too special. Just a basic good hot dog. 

My husband got the green dog and that one was good! I love the guac and lime in it. Definitely different from what I've had before. We got garlic fries which were good too.

Best thing about this place is their elote! Oh man it was amazing. They grill their corn, it was so juicy and good. As good as your elote man for sure! Definitely would come back for the hot dogs and elote. My husbands new favorite place!"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine could not stop raving about Dirt Dog so I needed to give this a place a try.
Once you enter, the register is a few feet away and the wall menu is immediately to your right. You order your food, get a number, and seat yourself wherever you like. 

The guy who took our order, Kevin, was amaazzingg! I was not too sure if he was a manager but he needs to be. He went over the menu with me too patiently, and I just had great service the entire time I was there. He even came over to our table a few times to make sure we liked everything.

For the food, I ordered the filthy fries and my friend had the Patty Melt Dog. The fries were so flavorful and the Patty Melt Dog was just woaaaah. Just try it. For the price and the quality, I would say this place gets a 11/10 + 4 thumbs up. 
Kevin even talked me into trying one of their house made churros and it was delicious. 
I brought my sister on a separate visit and we ordered the elotes with more filthy fries. It was just too good not to order again. 
I'm sorry but everything was just too good.
Thank you, I'll be back soon :-)"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this place. Especially with all the hype they were putting out. The elotes were small, the eloteros at Sunset Park have bigger corn, they taste better AND they are a whole dollar cheaper.  I ordered the elote esquite and the show it comes in a cocktail cup, nope. Came in a damn jello cup, small as hell. And the street tacos where horrible. No flavor, blan and tasted like cardboard. The only thing that was good were the dogs. Had the Patty melt and it was pretty good. Probably the only thing keeping this place going. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Theres been a lot of hype about this place so when i randomly found myself here for an afternoon bite, i was expecting a lot. Instead i found myself perusing a menu of various mexican inspired hotdogs and fries. Anything from elote fries to bacon wrapped jalapeño hot dogs topped with various sauces. I decided to start standard and got a basic bacon wrapped dog woth thousand island ketchup mustard and peppers. The hot dog itself is around $7 and then my basket of salt and pepper fries added on another $3 i just drank water. The food itself was ok. I wish i could find better words for it. I would go back to be a little more creative in my food choice but overall it wouldnt be the first place on my mind to go."}
{"text":"Ok, we've been wanting to try this for months. Need I say, the wait was well worth it! Didn't take pictures, but omg, so good! I've had other gourmet dogs, but this one leaves the rest in the dust. We had the house dog, the dirty corn and the filthy fries! Yes...way too much food. You definitely only need one dog, if you are getting fries, or share the fries if you want more than one dog. The corn was huge and delish as well! Very good and I'm glad to conveniently live by. This will definitely be my go to, on \"cheat\" days."}
{"text":"We had a couple of amazing hotdogs and some delicious corn of the cob and the cup of corn. The hotdogs are wrapped in bacon and you can choose from a number of different toppings. You can have it on a standard bun or Hawaiian or lobster roll type of bun. 
The corn on the cob was rolled in cheese and spices and the cup of corn had cheese and spices as well just no cob. 
It's a little far from our house as we live in the NW, but it was well worth the trip. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"If you love hot dog this is the place to be. Except this is more like gourmet type and customize it the way you like. Customer is excellent. Environment clean and chill. They play west coast music. Really impressed about this place they even serve alcohol and games if you like to chill around while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"This was an awesome hotdog. Pair it with garlic fries and a Stone IPA, and you can't go wrong. I had the house dog, and the toppings were awesome. I had the white roll, but next time I'm going to order the lobster roll, toasted and buttered. The place was clean, and the server was really helpful."}
{"text":"I heard nothing but good things about this place and it didn't disappoint. I had the Esquite fries and it was so good! They offer beer on tap which goes percent with vibe. It's kind of hidden but I'd differently recommend going out of your way for it."}
{"text":"Not sure why and how this place gets such good reviews. First, the service and operation. I have never seen a worse run restaurant in my life. It took 35 minutes to get my order of a hotdog and fries. It's a hotdog. Second, the food is overpriced. $6.25 for a hotdog and the biggest rip
Off is $3.25 for French fries that were frozen then fried. I wouldn't pay $1 for those fries. Third, food was ok but again a hotdog. Fried Oreos were good. Overall, if you want to save yourself an hour and overpaying for average food, avoid this place."}
{"text":"We each ordered a dog and spilt an order of fries and it was plenty!   The dogs are so big you have to eat with a fork and knife!  The only downfall is that you have to sit outside.  Food was good though!  Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"I'm in trouble... I broke my diet. BUT! Totally. Worth. IT! I got the green dog with the lobster roll... so delicious! The dirty corn was yummy! Oreos were so good! A great spot in the southwest! I ordered take out and service is spectacular! So friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"The green dog was amazing even without the bacon ... the dirty corn was Muy bueno . Great place and I will return"}
{"text":"Dirt dog is a hot dog that you will never forget! The flavors that the chef has created for these hot dogs on monster sized Texas toast is outstanding. I have eaten here 4 times and have not ordered the same thing twice and can easily give this place five stars. The line moves quickly the staff is friendly and the food is served promptly. You can adjust your order to your taste however I recommend trusting the Chef & Order directly from the menu the dogs are insanely good. The french fries are outstanding. This is not a location where you will go to stay on some sort of diet or eating plan. This is a place where you get an amazingly delicious fresh hot dog made like no other hot dog you've ever eaten. Recommended this too many friends and all have said the same thing this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. But I must say - the service was not great at all. This was my second time dining in. The first experience was fine - they were extremely busy but everything came out relatively quickly and together. HOWEVER, today it took over 30 minutes to get our whole order and it was not nearly as busy as the previous time I came. Not only that - it was brought out in numerous runs and therefore, some food got cold as we waited for the rest. When we confronted the staff, their solution was to just remove one of the items from our bill and refund us as we already paid. Needless to say, i was quite displeased with the customer service. I won't be dining in again as it isn't worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Supposedly this place has good hotdogs, haven't tried them yet tho. I've only eaten about $100 worth of churros in my 2 trips here in as many days. Like I want to try the hotdogs, but why waste the space with them when I can happily fulfill my 20,000 calorie per day diet with 6 orders of Mexican breadsticks."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I am such a fan of good hot dogs! I kept seeing this place pop up on my YELP as a \"NEW and HOT Business\"  and being that it's on the southwest area of town made it kind of convenient to drive to since I'm not that far away. I assumed this until I actually got into the car and start driving here. It's located in a pretty random area and not to mention a bit tricky to find depending on which way you are coming from. I had to ask myself \"No why would they put this location way out here\" Anyways so I finally located this place and pulled in.

Service is so HUGE in my book especially when you are a new establishment. I have to say that I wasn't impressed at all with the level on friendliness or service. I've had better service and hot dogs from Wienerschnitzel's.. No Shade! For starters, when I walked in I wasn't acknowledged and finally when somebody did come from the back they just looked at me look at the menu. No \" Hello!...Welcome!...Any questions on the menu?...\" you know the key components that I thought come pretty standard in a business. With you being a new place you usually have people make suggestions on the menu or hell even ask do you have any questions?. When I was finally greeted my order was taken and the guy who took my order went right back to talking to his friend or maybe a co-worker that was sitting at the counter about personal plans for the weekend. He was more concerned with getting back to that conversation than worrying about my first experience here. Not a good start at all. I ordered the House Dog... Red Dog... Sea Salt Fries.. Ran me a little over $15 and some change. Wait time on the food was quick. I opened my bag to make sure that the order was correct which it was. When I was on the way home of course I wanted to nibble on some fries only to find they weren't as fresh as I know they probably could've been. I was pretty much over it at this point and a little sorry I made the trip to try it out. The hot dogs were just OK.. Just didn't give me that WOW factor. You could tell they'd been sitting for a while and tasted maybe even a tad bit overcooked? Idk maybe I should've tried it on a different bun or maybe I didn't do that because it wasn't even suggested at the time of ordering. In my mind I feel if you have 3 different buns to offer I'm sure some of these buns are probably paired better with different type of hot dogs that the employee can kindly suggest. That didn't happen. I have to mention all this because these are simple things that can cost people from wanting to even come here to dine. I can't say that I'd be back anytime soon too many cons than pros...And if I do hopefully the experience will be a lot better."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today.  It was so good.  We both had something from the \"Secret Menu\" and they were delicious!  And the Elotes!   OMG best I have ever had.  Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"As I walk in I am greeted by Tupac - dear mama playing on their radio followed by gangsta party and there's something soothing about that lol

First things first... the entrance is located in a very weird spot. The customers standing in line to order food are literally blocking the entrance/exit door so getting in and out is a little more of a hassle than it should be.

Vegetarian options are available. We got the vegetarian hot dog with red sauce. The hot dog and everything on and around it was delicious. Tons of flavor and the spice level was up there so be sure to have a drink ready (coming from someone who loves spicy food).

I'm honestly not really a hot dog loving kind of guy but I did it for the yelp!! XD"}
{"text":"love the hot dogs here. its different and very delicious. a variety of flavors. i had the spicy one and it was perfect. not too spicy where you cant taste the flavor. i would recommend friends and family there."}
{"text":"This place is all that and the bag of chips with salsa best hotdogs  I ever had will come back"}
{"text":"If your looking for a good hot dog with a kick this is the place!!

Also you're crazy if you don't try the dessert menu from deep-fried Twinkies to deep-fried Oreos this is the place to be! 

The red dog was my favorite along with the deep-fried Oreos! 

Say what's up to Cameron in the kitchen he's the man!"}
{"text":"The combination of reaper one hot sauce, dirty dog, and draft beer is creative and intense. Good for snacks but to be full you gotta at least eat a couple."}
{"text":"Thank you for bringing these delish dogs to the Southwest!  

The food: ever wander out of a LA bar at 2am and smell bacon deliciousness?  Welp, Dirt Dog just brought that to Vegas!  Bacon wrapped dogs with grilled onions and peppers.....where it gets good?  The bonus toppings!  House, green, red or brown.  I chose the Red Dog, upon ordering I was warned that it was spicy.  No lie there!  Spicy with a great flavor but certainly a lasting sting.  Paired with garlic fries complete with fried garlic it was a meal I would come back for.  Craft beers on tap, sweet!  I was able to sample the corn courtesy of my boyfriend and it puts street corn to shame!  Picture elote, just add bacon....bacon makes everything better, am I right??  And then the sweet, sweet finale to my meal....D-E-S-S-E-R-T! That's right, dessert!  Fried Twinkie and Oreos to be exact, paired with housemade horchata whipped cream and sprinkles, my inner fat kid was pleased. 

If I didn't say enough about the food to have you venture to Dirt Dog, let me tell you about the staff and atmosphere.

The staff was friendly, offered a thorough detail of the menu, the back story of the restaurant and that was just when we walked in.  During our meal we were checked on by multiple staff members ensuring we enjoyed our meal.  There were suggestions for future visits on their favorite menu items as well.  The restaurant was clean and well kept, tables bussed and free of trash.  The 90's hip hop kept things nostalgic for me.  The only thing I would change, it was a smidge warm in the restaurant.  Not unbearable, but it wouldn't be pleasant for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Food was good. The person helping on the floor was friendly but they were seriously understaffed for a busy Sunday afternoon. I came in when it wasn't busy and then a massive amount of people came in. Nothing against the staff. They were working hard and trying to get through it all. I ordered an horchata ice cream to be made later. I requested it towards the end of our meal and it was about 20 minutes later that I decided to get up and go. They were so busy I felt bad complaining about a refund. Again, food was good. I would go again but maybe not at a busy time."}
{"text":"The music in the place was so horrid, hardcore gangster rap. The last thing one wants to hear while eating a hot dog is someone on the radio talking about putting a \"di@$\" in your mouth. Seriously put it on the top hits station. Definitely can't take your kids here.. Well if your a decent parent, what do I know though.. Maybe I have bad taste in the generations music. I walked out feeling like I needed to bust a cap or pick up so ho-ho's to get some street cred

Now to the food. It was most delicious.. I highly recommend the #1.. Thing was so dang good I would def come back just for that. The food is really good!!  Just know your crowd with the music... I would of given the place 5 stars but I'm going off the total ambiance. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"this place is sooo bomb!!! went here on Saturday, the staff is amazing!! super nice & helpful ... willing to explain anything on the menu !! The elote fries were to die for and the churro ice cream omgggggg i have to go back asap !!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Super friendly and welcoming staff and the food gets cooked and served really fast! I ordered an elote dog and boy was I happy!! Very accommodating staff! I'm from riverside ca but I came to the Nevada location! I will be back next time I'm out here!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to trying this place out for month and finally made it! Has the home dog, elote and green dog. The home dog was my fav and prob the best hotdog I've ever had! Can't wait to go back again to try something new!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from Dirt Dog. When I arrived, I was greeted by a Anisha. Her bubbly personality made me feel extremely welcomed. 

I wasn't sure what to order so I asked Anisha what she recommended. She recommended the \"Green Dog\" and the Chili Dog. I decided to order the Chili dog on the lobster roll bun, Al Pastor taco, and the Horchata Ice Cream with a Churro. 

The Chili Dog - was made with a house made spicy aioli, bacon and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize until after the fact that it had Aioli. I must say that I hate Aioli or Mayo. However, it was really good.

The Al Pastor - was marinated and seasoned really well with onions, and pineapples. 

The Churro and Horchata Ice Cream - was one of the best Churros that I've had in a long time. It was super moist in the inside and crunchy on the outside. 

Anisha, made my experience a Dirt Dog a memorable one. She went above and beyond with making sure I enjoyed my food, she also informed me of the other location as well, since, I'm new to the Las Vegas area. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Yuuuuum!  

High quality hot dog wrapped in bacon.  Enough said.

And then you add all the yummy accompaniments and you've got a dirty dog. 

The salt and pepper fries are just that, salt and pepper fries.  Nothing special, but not bad.

We tried the dirty chili dog and the green dog and left completely satisfied.

We also got the taco al pastor and it was extremely flavorful.

Would we return?  Absolutely!  We gotta get dirty again!"}
{"text":"I've heard of Dirt Dog through social media and kept seeing the add for it. My partner and I were deciding for weeks to try out the delicious looking fries and hot dogs. Finally we decided to go one night. Walking into the place  I got an LA vibe, and was chill. The menu is posted on the wall next to the register with pictures and helpful descriptions of each item. The staff was cheerful and very helping. It could have maybe needed some more seating accommodations in the place do to the high volume. The food came out quicker than I thought. We both ended up getting the Elotes Dog and it was alright. It could have been a lot better with a signature sauce with the dog, but it was still very enjoyable. Now the fries were amazing. I was impressed by how they tasted. The chili fries were great. I would highly recommend them to all my friends. Overall I enjoyed it and felt very satisfied. Also it would be so convenient to open a location elsewhere around Vegas. I'll definitely be going to Dirt Dogs again."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner and staff were very helpful about the menu. My husband is a hot dog kind of guy and he liked his green dog with the lobster flavored bun. The garlic fries are good!
I had a brown dog and found sauce to be rather salty.
I had the dirty corn which was very tender. 
The decor is clean and sparse, and they serve beers and sodas.
My husband had the deep fried oreo and enjoyed that.
I was not overwhelmed but it is a fun place if you are a hot dog aficionado. I love that the space is such that no one is sitting too close to anyone else!!"}
{"text":"Super tasty! Awesome flavors and really fun vibe. I highly recommend the Mutt Dog and Dirty Corn."}
{"text":"Literally sitting here right now, just finished the Green Dog. Husband had the Dirty Corn and the baby is eating Dirty Fries. So good, had to review immediately. Honestly the best dog I've ever had. The place is nicely redone since the old Cheeburger Cheeburger left. Can't wait to get a beer here once it's ready to pour. I'm so glad this place is in the southwest part of town. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This concept is really cool. American hot dogs meets LA steet tacos meets Asian fusion. They even have micro brews on tap. The red dog was delicious with just the right spice. Also got the homemade churros and horchata ice cream was bomb! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Hotdogs!! Such great flavor. Also had chili cheese fries which were amazing. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Dirt Dogggggg fire 
Mmmm....
Can't never go wrong with a good ol Dirt Dogggggg
Very tasty!!!! 
 I'm finna custom my dog next time try a mutt dog with chili cheese added tell me how it goes"}
{"text":"I may have just died and gone to hot dog heaven! I ordered the dirty chili dog and an order of garlic fries. The hot dog was so juicy and the toppings were delicious! I ordered it in a buttery lobster roll style bun which just made it even more gluttonous! The garlic fries were seasoned perfectly and the portion is definitely big enough to share. Beyond that they were playing such grest music. I look forward to my return!!"}
{"text":"Clean place and very friendly staff. Decided to go with the Chimichurri Dog and that might of been the best hot dog I've ever had in my life. This place is highly underrated and I would love to see this business do well and expand."}
{"text":"Over priced, loud obnoxious music and poor quality of price and experience. One and done with this place."}
{"text":"Omg delicious. Must order the dogs on butter toast/lobster roll. Tried a few things from the menu and it was all good. Save room for desserts...horchata whipped cream fried oreos"}
{"text":"THAT HOTCHATA SPREAD THOUGH. 

Ive been wanting to check out Dirt Dog after seeing pictures all over IG. I knew they had an LA location so I was excited to see that they opened one here in Vegas. 

Came here on a Saturday night around 5 pm. We started off with some elotes aka \"dirty corn.\" The elote was bomb dot com, spread with lime infused mayo and butter compote and topped with cotija cheese, cilantro, and chili powder! With every bite, I could taste all the ingredients. It was so flavorful, and I don't remember enjoying corn as much as I did here. 

We tried a few of their hot dogs which included the Red Dog, Green Dog, Mutt Dog, and the House Dog. My favorite was the Mutt Dog, which is half Green Dog and half Red Dog. The Green Dog is topped with their homemade guac, chimichurri sauce, onions, bell peppers, and lime, while the Red Dog comes with a spicy tomato chile and chipotle aioli sauce. Besides all the fresh toppings and condiments, what makes these hot dogs so great is that all the sausages come bacon wrapped and placed in a lobster bun. The lobster bun adds some sweetness and butteriness to the hot dog and another level of awesome altogether. 

The fries were also really good, perfectly crisp and crunchy. The Filthy Fries were straight up filthy (in positive terms). The cheddar sauce was freakin amazing, and I wanted to spread it all over my hot dog. Talking about spread, I gotta come back to that horchata spread. Oh man, the desserts here are off the charts! I would come back just for the desserts alone. The fried Oreos were to die for along with the fried Twinkie. The batter was killer, and it was the best fried oreo I've ever had. They both came with this Horchata whipped cream, and I don't wanna hype it, but that Horchata spread was so damn good that I wanted to shed a tear. 

The entire staff was super friendly, and big ups to Tiffany for her excellent service and explaining every single dish down to all the nitty gritty details. 

Excellent food and superior service. Doesn't get better than that. Dirt Dog is a place you do not want to miss here in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating in Dirt dog but I'm sure it not the last. When we first got, the parking is kind of empty and also inside the restaurant. We felt that Dirt Dog might have terrible food. However,since I already had arived we decided to try some of there food, House Dog and Red Dog. They both delicious. Service was great and nice decorating."}
{"text":"I was skeptical as the menu primarily had gourmet/abstract toppings (I was not expecting this). However, I was blown away by the quality of the house dog! This was an amazing choice. 

One thing I noted is they seemed short handed. It took quite awhile so if in a hurry this may not be a good choice. This was rectified with great customer service however as they added additional fries due to the wait and gave deep fried oreos to others that waited a considerable amount of time. 

Only knock would be the fries....nothing great about them...just OK.

I will be back for the house dog!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We went in one evening wanting to try something new. The interior is well done and the employees are super cool. They explained the menu and gave recommendations. Customer service was top notch.  We had the house dogs and Dirty Fries. Best dog I've had outside of the east coast. Next up is the green dog! If you like hot dogs, this place is a must for you to try. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Omg!! Today was my cheat day my and this was the place to go. I seen them on Facebook and drove 30 minuets. It was worth every minute, customer service fantastic and food. I will be going back. If you haven't been, you gotta go."}
{"text":"Great new place in Las Vegas! I went there on July 4th and this is really a hidden gem.

To begin, this place is conveniently located on Rainbow Blvd right between Blue Diamond Road and 215 so it is really easy to access. There is also plenty of parking. The place is reasonably big and wasn't packed at all when I went there.

This place offers specialty hot-dogs for $5.95 and sides (Fries, corn, etc...) and desserts (Deep-Fried twinkies, oreos, and churros, etc...) for $2.95. But this place becomes even more interesting with their beer selection. Dirt Dog offers a rotating selection of craft beers that are absolutely amazing. Whether you like light or dark beers, citrus or grapefruit flavored beers, expect to find something you like there! Jesse was instrumental in introducing all these beers to us and making us have a great time there. 

The atmosphere there is great and they even had a DJ and free cotton candy that day! In the end, I would definitely recommend this place as a must try in the Las Vegas area if you like hot-dogs and great craft beers. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"Love the brown dog. Really, all of them are good, but the teriyaki/sesame combo somehow works. The garlic fries are good, but I was spoiled with amazing garlic fries in the Bay Area, so I generally pass on those. Definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"As much as I love a 'Los Angeles' bacon wrapped hot dog, this place came pretty close to. Best part is, I'm WALKING distance to it!!! I ordered the plain bacon wrapped dog with the veggies (bell peppers and onions). It was good and the bread they use, the put butter on it and grill it. Nice touch!

The 5 Stars is really for the service.  I was there on 12/16 The front counter girl is awesome, great service! There's a girl that was working there that impressed me. She's short (like me) and had curly, dark hair. I don't know her name but that girl was on point in delivering food to the tables and getting the tables clean, all while smiling and being personable! She deserves a raise! Next time I go in, I'll ask her name so I can post it here."}
{"text":"The hot dogs were really good but I would like to see a bigger menu. It was really good to try and I'll probably go back! It was also very clean which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere !!! This truly felt like an LA eatery and you would know so by the picture of Tupac at the register. I got the teriyaki dog which had grillled onion and sauce and a few other vegies it was hardy and amazing. They had a hot dog there that...get this....had Mexican corn on top I almost fainted and this beautiful creation it was a bit heavy but worth the bite. The flavor was all there along with some friendly staff and service the dirty dog is a great place to have a great meal."}
{"text":"#1P carne asada fries & brown dog.
#2P filthy fries & chile dog - lobster bread

A couple of my friends have been raving about dirt dog but I was never into it until I saw photos of it on instagram and I instantly got the cravings for it. I came in on a Wednesday afternoon, I got in before the rush so service was quick and employees were very friendly. Food is as tasty as it looks. Their choice of playlist was on point! I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool LA Vibe with the decor and the food. There is a 90's hip hop/rap list playing that gives you all the feels. It's a really chill spot you can hang out with the friends at to grab a quick bite or sit down and dine. It's on the smaller side but you could get a small group of friends in.

Then menu consist of different gourmet hotdog creations that seem to be themed around Mexican flavors. They also had different types of fries, elote, churros and draft beer.

All their hotdogs are all beef dogs wrapped in bacon with your choice of white bun, Portuguese or Texas toast. 

I had the elote dog and it was pretty tasty. It had corn, lime, special sauce, cotija cheese, and few other things I can't remember.  

All in all I thought it was pretty good! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! So much flavor and options. Even if you don't like hot dogs, there are other options for you. It was crazy busy when we arrived, but the food was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time at this place about 2 weeks ago. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The food was AMAZING. we ordered a little bit of everything. The orchata ice cream was a great ending. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great concept we need more you guys got it going on great music great food and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!!! Their bacon wrapped Red Dog was life changing!!!! &&&& their CARNE ASADA FRIES! so great! I'm from LA know what a great street hotdog is and this place lives up to it!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a lot better then expected. Service was great. I ordered the hot dog with chimichurrj and guacamole on it in lobster bun. Was so good and I don't even like guacamole. I recommend getting the lobster bum. We also had the elote fries which were damn good as well. The only reason I didn't rate 5 star is you have to blow my mind in order to do that but this place was good & worth the try."}
{"text":"Super great feel when I walked into the place. The menu definitely struck me first, next the music and then the murals of Kobe and Tupac towards the back. The tribute to two of LA's easily most recognizable put a smile on my face. 

The woman at the front taking orders was very friendly and helpful with suggestions and descriptions for first timers. Their offerings are not just regular ballpark hot dogs. They offer creative gourmet hot dogs and more that will have you salivating from just reading descriptions on a menu."}
{"text":"was amazed.  like let's be for real you'll never have something so good. crazy combinations are the best and everything here was brought fresh and fast. had a huge party tried a lot."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great and upbeat, service was great, got our food very fast--within 5 or 7 minutes. Many different choices, planning another trip soon so i can try more of their hotdogs. Got the elote dog and it was delicious! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I pretty much tried every hot dog they had and seriously all were delicious! My absolute favorite though, was there corn in a cup. I mean WOW , I am drooling right now just thinking about that darn corn. My kids loved their homemade chip and of course their fried Oreos. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Damn good dogs, okay prices. My wife and I spent $35 on two hotdogs, one order of fries and two beers. Ball park prices to me. Just say'n!"}
{"text":"I LOOOOOOOVE Dirt Dog. It's right down the street, so I love bringing family and friends from out of town to try it out. The service is always friendly and helpful. The only potential drawback is a fairly limited menu, but everything is good so that doesn't bother me. My go-to is the Brown Dog and the Dirty Fries. One night I took my 3 kids for dessert and shared the fried Oreos, fried Twinkie, Churro and Horchata Ice Cream. So fun and delicious. Go give these guys some business!!"}
{"text":"So I  have been waiting to try this place for a long time finally made it there and it was super yummy and creative all the different kinds of fries were super fun what's better then hotdogs fries and a beer wait don't forget the good music too"}
{"text":"This place is so fun, and cool! I love the different themes of the dogs, and I was happy to know they offered a veggie dog so I can bring my hippie friends. (I love hippies, and meat) the House Dog was kick ass, #TheDirtyCorn, dirty chips, dirty fries, pattymelt dog, everything was amazing (the fam & hippy friends gave good reviews). I also liked the huge map on the wall and the whole concept of putting a sticker where you lived. It's fun urban hot dog joint with great quality food, and great service. 5 stars for DirtDog"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype...so many different delicious options and love how many vegan alternative options they have. We ordered 2 hot dogs, vegan fries, 2 garlic fries, 2 bottled cokes, a jamaica drink and s churro all for about $40...first time somewhere requires lots of testing material..."}
{"text":"So happy to find out what the hype was all about! I now know why everyone raves about this place. 

Decor is awesome and love the playlist. Definitely a crowded place so you have to find a table quick! 

They have so many different options, who knew you could make a hotdog so many different ways. I got the elote dog, best thing ever. A little messy so don't wear your favorite clothes that day. Also got the garlic fries, fresh garlic on the top, so excellent. 
 
The staff was all super friendly, and I was happy to see they had Stella cidre on tap! Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I'm blown away! So good the corn was amazing, and so was the house dog  I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere!! It's like a party with some bomb food and a super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Their hot dogs are soooo tasteful! They are overpriced and far out from my side of town. But if you're craving a California style hot dog, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I saw the post on Facebook and it made the Elote dog a must have. The place is very busy which is a sign they are doing it right. The Facebook post said all their hot dogs were bacon wrapped! Well after a short wait my Elote dog arrived and after my first bite almost all the toppings slid off and underneath was a non-bacon wrapped hot dog, boooo! Overall a decent hot dog, but not crazy good. I will try it again someday, but overall my first visit was just ok.
The service was great and a good cashier too."}
{"text":"So I been wanting to visit this place for quite some time. I think like most people, I saw this place on social media. The atmosphere is great they even have games you can check out but I feel like the hotdogs fell kinda short. Maybe I just had high expectations from all the hype I saw on this place. I only been here once and the hotdog I tried is called the red dog, it was just ok. Let's just say I wouldn't travel across town for another one. Another thing that was a disappointment was the  corn on the cob, it had way too much lemon and not enough spice. I rather get it from a Mexican creamery or on the street from a elotero."}
{"text":"Finally got to taste LA's finest dogs. If you don't eat meat because you're pescatarian, vegan or vegetarian, no worries! This place offers straight vegan dogs or simply no meat! I got the Veggie dog which is soy based! The price and portion for the food is decent. If you're big fan of Elote, try their dirty corn! I really enjoyed their fries. There are numerous sauce you can use. Try getting the garlic sauce! Best time to come is before 2/3 before the high schoolers across the street come out. Anything after that time during the weekdays, expect it to be packed! Overall, it was a nice place for lunch with throwback RnB musics playing in the background!"}
{"text":"This place is so good I brought my sister and my mom and it just reminds us of LA the corn hot dogs are the best. Honestly anything that I've had in there which I've had almost everything is just incredible the flavors are just extraordinary. It's a bit of a drive for me but it's well worth it on the staff is so nice and so helpful."}
{"text":"Been here twice in a month!  The employees are very friendly. When you walk in, you are greeted right away. The place will customize your hot dog exactly how you want it.  One thing to point out, they also serve delicious tacos! However, you would never know because the menu board with the tacos is located behind you and not next to the hot dog menu. 

The food arrives pretty quickly.  The place is very clean too.

You not want to bring your kids here because the music they are playing is mostly from Tu-Pac (RIP) and his lyrics are a little raunchy.

I hope this place keeps up the good work. I'll keep returning if they do!"}
{"text":"Very unique dogs, gourmet, tasty and pricey. Quality food. It at the end of the day it's a hotdog place and they do the best they can. Worth a visit every few months, closer to 3.5 than a true 4"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive, garlic fries are legitimate just minced garlic not much flavor but the hot dogs are still good"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. 
I'm not vegetarian but had the veggie dog with the red option.
My hotdog had 0 sauce. Onions, peppers, and red pepper flakes on it. I had to put ketchup and hot sauce on it for any flavor. 
Everyone else who got the non veggie item said the same thing. All were dry with barely any sauce. 
The \"cook\" had a weird awkward smirk on his face while making it and the vibe of the place seemed uncomfortable. 
My bun also tasted burnt. 
I ate half and put it down. 
The dirty corn was AWESOME though I will say that and that's the ONLY reason why I will give it 2 stars was the corn.

Boring and dry for me and 3 other patrons having the same opinion. I don't see why this place has a high rating... maybe we came on a OFF night. Cooks seemed young and rude and the food was bland and dry.

Doubt I'll be back. 
Maybe for the corn, and that's it."}
{"text":"If you like gourmet dogs this is the place to hit Dirt DoG LA isn't playing around when it comes to having elite hotdogs! From the atmosphere to the menu to the food presentation this is screaming LA steer dogs to the T! I decided to go with the green dog and let me tell you it was nothing short of amazing from the consistency of the bread to the perfect amount of topping so it could still be hand-held was perfection! Also went with the chili cheese fries which were amazing the quality of chili was on point! Also tried the deep fried Oreos and Wow perfect way to top off a delicious dog and chili cheese fries"}
{"text":"The staff and food was amazing. My husband had the house dog. My daughter had the brown dog and I had the mutt dog on their secret menu. The horchata ice cream and churro was the best! Highly recommend this place. Reasonably priced, great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Ok so this place has really good hot dogs and the deep fried Oreos are good also. It has a quiet atmosphere with really good music I recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Went over for dinner today and was super happy with the food. Came out fast and the workers were super nice. Liked the new fries they have filthy fries and the green dog is always good and the horchata ice cream was good as always and the churro was bomb."}
{"text":"The setup of the ordering just didn't do it for me if we ended wanting something else we had to get in line again to order, (annoying).  had to wait at the ordering line even if we were the first with no other costumers. Cashier was serving food and sweeping after we ordered. I had the chorizo tacos, they're okay nothing I can't do at home. Hubby is a big fan of hotdogs and wasn't amazed he said there was nothing special. I took the corn cup to go and didn't like it, it had \"OIL\" in it and too much cheese just didn't tasted right. I guess the highlight of the order was the fries."}
{"text":"DIRT DOG IS F***ING AMAZING! 

Tucked away in a small retail plaza on Rainbow just north of Blue Diamond, Dirt Dog offers some bomb-ass hot dogs, fries, and fried desserts. 

The space is actually quite bigger than you'd expect, and they're actually not that busy...probably in part due to the remoteness of their location (but that's perfectly okay by me). 

Get the Dirty Chili Dog. It's the best dog they offer. Bun, bacon-wrapped dog, hearty meaty chili (no beans), cheese, onions, cilantro, and chili aioli. Perfection. The chili has spice, but not heat. And if you can manage to get that perfect bite of everything together, you'll be a customer for like.

The second-best product Dirt Dog offers is the Deep-Fried Oreos. Seriously. You need these in your life. They offer the perfect contrast to everything you just experienced with your Dirty Chili Dog. They're not overly-battered or greasy, they're sweet, warm, and the perfect texture. 

You NEED Dirt Dog in your life. Next time you're nearby, give it a go. You won't regret it. In fact, you'll probably be back next week."}
{"text":"I dream about this place!! I didn't even think I liked hotdogs! Go there, YOU WONT BE SORRY!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, very casual and laid back. The staff is super helpful when choosing what to order. They are all knowledgeable about the food and always as if this is our first time dining. Love that each hot dog is bacon wrapped! The street corn is amazing! My favorite thing. They also have plenty of craft beers and can help you pair the best beer with your dog! The music is great and the vibe is trendy."}
{"text":"Greeted immediately, great staff, great atmosphere and board games to play which I feel is always a nice touch. Food is extremely flavorful - I'm actually not a fan of hot dogs but my boyfriend is and he loved it! I loved the corn, the carne asada fries and fried oreos! Very filling/heavy but will definitely be back every once in awhile."}
{"text":"I had the Dirt Dog location in LA bookmarked, so I was excited to see they opened not just this location, but another one on the Strip (Grand Bazaar Shops) with more possible locations coming in the future. This location isn't on my side of town however the trek was well worth it! Maybe just maybe one day they will open closer to me! Inside was clean and the staff was very friendly and happy to answer questions I had about the menu. You can get your order to-go or they have a good amount of tables/seating inside. Tacos are a newer addition to the Dirt Dog menu and I thought they were pretty good. The dogs are really where it's at for me, but it's nice to have options.

Chicken Tinga Taco ($2) - Chipotle tomato sauce, onions and cilantro. Corn tortillas are currently the only option for the tacos, no flour. Holy shit this was a spicy taco! I loved the flavor and even though I seriously had sweat rolling down my face, I couldn't help but keep taking another bite. 

Al Pastor Taco ($2) - The meat is marinated and grilled pineapples and onions are what tops this taco. Al Pastor is usually my taco of choice so I was really looking forward to trying this one. Sadly it wasn't good at all. When I picked up the taco it fell it was so soggy that all the fillings just fell through. The pineapple seemed canned, so not sure how it's getting grilled. I prefer fresh pineapple that you see getting sliced over a spit or grill.

Carne Asada Taco ($2) - Pico de Gallo and scallions top this red chile cilantro marinated asada. Good flavor and especially well liked by my hubby. They have some really tasty sauces/salsas here that pair nicely with this taco. 

Dirt Dogs are about $6 each and come fully loaded. They don't skimp on toppings and have great flavor. I love the slightly buttered and grilled split-top buns (aka new england or lobster bun) and the bread holds the dog and toppings nicely. They also have Portuguese and traditional buns as an option.  

The Dirty Chips are very good and I recommend adding cheese and meat of your choice it really takes these tasty chips up another level. Dirty Corn is reasonably priced and I didn't think it was bad, but I didn't think it was great either. My drink of choice here is the Horchata it's very good and better than I have had at other places recently. Oh yes, they also serve beer! For dessert you can choose from fried oreos or twinkies, horchata ice cream and churros. It's worth nothing for all the vegan eaters out there that they also have a vegan taco ($2) on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing Dirtdogs instagram and after looking at reviews. The hotdogs were good, we ordered fries and when we got them their was a hair, they were replaced immediately. I probably wouldn't come back just for the hot dogs.... but the dessert! Must try the horchata  ice cream !!! And the churro was a perfect addition."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Food. Vibe.  Owner is a genius 
Get the elote dog or elote fries.  Those are my favs"}
{"text":"Bomb! Get your money's worth here. The service is really good. Their deep fried Oreos are so good with their sauce they make for it. So many options all great choices."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! I'm not a big fan of hotdogs, but this place is something else! Their hotdogs are sooo flavorful and juicy! So delicious! I always get the Elote Dog and it's amazing!! & You'll get full off one hotdog! Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Great dogs with lots of options!  Same with their fries.  The corn in a cup is yummy. Wish there was one in the northwest!"}
{"text":"I tried the dirt dog red with the \"lobster roll\".  The roll was just a smaller piece of bread formed for a hotdog.  The hotdog was good but way too spicy for me.  I will try a different dog next time.  Their corn is excellent.  I want to try different sides next time.  Second visit I got the house dirt dog with their regular bun.  This is myrtle if dog.  It had sautéed peppers and onions with ketchup mustard and a green chili save that was killer.  They even grill the bun so it's nice and crispy the way I like them.  I tried their \"dirty chips\" (homemade potato chips) and they were tasty.  They give you a little plastic ramekin with ketchup for dipping."}
{"text":"This place has became my go to place, food is always in point. I've tried all there Dogs and have to say they're all good.


Highlights:
-Mutt dog on lobster roll
-Red dog on lobster roll
-Filthy fries
-Fried Oreos"}
{"text":"Love the music love and the dogs are yum. We got more than we should, but when a dog is that good, you can't go wrong.  The only down side was their CO2 was broken when we came...so no beer with our dogs. Wahhh"}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs, good prices great atmosphere.  Everybody was super friendly and attentive.  Great music and games to play, we were too busy trying all the great food.  Kids meals are a great deal, corn dogs, fries, drink and Oreos with an amazing horchata whipped cream.  One of the favorites for our group were the Filthy Fries, awesome guacamole!"}
{"text":"I only had their house dog and corn at the spring festival. I have to say I'm impressed! Both were delish. Going to visit their restaurant soon"}
{"text":"How Dirty will you get? I came to see how dirty it is ;) I ordered some takeout today. I waited 10 mins for my order, not too bad a wait.

The place had a nice atmosphere and very open, hip hop music was playing.

Their Green Dog is flavorful - sweet & citrusy. I had it on the lobster bun and the bun was delicious.

The House Dog was ok and the guy at the counter says that's their popular dog. I couldn't taste all of the individual flavors like the green chile spread, or the bacon. 

I especially came here for their Dirty Corn I saw online. It was just okay to me. I definitely tasted the cheese and the bacon bits. 

The guy at the front counter was inviting, friendly and helpful as he explained what's popular on the menu.

I would say if you want to stop by for the experience, you should go for it but it didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"2nd time here and the food, employees, and atmosphere are amazing! Perfect for a quick lunch or date night on the weekend ;)"}
{"text":"Dirt dog is honestly a hidden gem! It's in a hidden place but they serve quality food. I got a dirty chili dog and it was $7 which is pretty steep for a hot dog. I found the hot dog okay, it wasn't anything too special. However, their elote was AMAZING! It was perfect and I would definitely eat their elote again! I would also love to try their desserts and tacos! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so late it's a shame of me cause dirt dog is an awesome hotdog place courteous friendly service I loved the dirt dog and I went here when they had a grand opening for there new store then I returned multiple times after that and sometimes they send out coupons to try one for free highly recommended and of course repeat repeat repeat........"}
{"text":"Absolute worst place I have been. Ordered the Patty melt dog with sea salt and pepper fries. Fries were delivered to the table with absolutely no seasoning. Then when the dogs came to the table they had raw onions. We asked for grilled. They took them back to remake them. The second time around the onions were grilled but the fries on the dog were ice cold. At that point I asked for the manager. However, she was too busy messing with the TV. We waited over 5 minutes for her to come over so we just got up and demanded a refund. Also both dogs were the exact same, yet looked completely different. Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"Wowza, Dirt Dog!!
I never had a bacon wrapped hot dog in my life before... it was delicious!! Worth all the calories and fat and sodium.
I usually try to stay away from processed meats, but after reading some of the good reviews, I had to try their hot dog!! I'm glad I did!! The dirty corn was amazing, too.
I can not come here as often as I want to, but when I feel like indulge myself with a hot dog, I'll definitely come back to Dirt Dog."}
{"text":"So by now everyone knows what Dirt Dog is and all the wonders of their hot dogs on lobster rolls so no need for me to go into anymore mouth watering details about how these are the best hot dogs on the planet and all the toppings you can choose are amazing and they come with your choice of buns with the lobster roll being the most buttery flavorful roll that you will ever put a hot dog in and never eat anything else again . But instead I will talk about the churro :)

The churro is only $2 and it is fresh and crunchy and moist in the middle and has plenty of cinnamon sugar which is a must for churros and there is even lots at the bottom of the basket that you can pick up and keep making it rain goodness all over your churro . I personally like to take my time and continue to dress my churro up and make sure every bit is covered with the special dust so I never get a naked bite lol. And to top of the churro they send it out with a whipped cinnamon cream that kinda taste like horchata which just really puts the finishing touch on the churro. If you need a desert look no further and you also have the option to have a horchata ice cream to go with it or just add one of their fabulous horchata drinks which are rich and smooth"}
{"text":"Love the creative menu and beer options. For my first visit I had the green dog and house dog. The house dog reminds me of a what some people call a  \"stadium\" dog. Between the dogs though I really liked the green dog and it's flavor. We wrapped up the meal with the deep fried Oreos! If you've never had them, you need to try them. We ordered two and the manager gave us an extra order. You know we ate them all! Make sure you try the horchata whip cream that they serve with the Oreos."}
{"text":"TRULY THE BEST HOTDOG EVER!!!

I was skeptical of this place at first. Once I saw the menu, I was put at ease. We were greeted by the cashier, Alex and he was very welcoming. When the food arrived, it looked just like the pictures. The flavor was better than I can explain. The food was so good that I bookmarked this place and will definitely be back. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone, specially if you don't like hotdogs. If you eat this hotdogs and don't like them, than you will never like hotdogs."}
{"text":"Watch out, Las Vegas! The only bad thing u can say about this place is that it's so close to my house (there goes the diet)! 

Upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly woman at the counter with bright pink hair. The dining room is very cool/hip/clean. The music is mix of something you'd hear in LA - some reggae, kayne, and sublime made for a relaxed feel (maybe not so much the kayne, but personal opinion ha!). 

We were asked if we had been there before and said \"no.\" The cashier went on to tell us about their hot dogs and which things she enjoyed the most. I went with the Red Dog and asked for the chili flakes on the side (I get worried when cooks have the ability to scorch my mouth with pepper flakes), the \"Dirty Esquite,\" a fried Twinkie  and a fountain drink. Came to roughly $14 - not bad at all!

The hot dog was pretty spicy without the flakes on top for a garnish. It was super flavorful, had a nice snap/crunch, and the traditional bun was perfect with it. The Esquite was packed with flavor! It comes with a lime wedge, which you definitely want to use. The fried Twinkie was, well, a fried Twinkie. It was delicious. But what set it off was the horchata whipped cream! Can i have that on every dessert for the rest of my life please?!

I can't wait to come back and try new dogs, sides and I'll be hitting that fried Oreos and churros on the next go 'round! Well done, Dirt Dog! Well done, indeed!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Staff very friendly, always checking to see how your doing or if you need anything else. Well recommended!! Love it and their food is delicious. Always fresh and served on a timely manner. Thank you will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Pretty good hot dogs. The garlic fries were definitely on point. My fiancée and I shared the red dog and the patty melt one. Patty melt was definitely better. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I will definitely make the drive to come here again. We had the House Dog and Elote Dog with the filthy fries and fried Oreos. 2"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The music playing is so upbeat and they have two games playing on the TV. The people working are super attentive. The food is amazing! The corn is super sweet and delicious! Overall this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Holy shit this food amazing!!!  The atmosphere is so chill and relaxing and the customer service is the best I've had in a looooong time and sooo clean!!!"}
{"text":"Had Dirt Dog first time last night. Ordered 4 dog (two green, one plain-with relish, and 1 cheese), 2 corn and dirty fries). Total was $55. It was tasty and I did enjoy it but the price is outrageous when you really think about what you've purchased - that is a cost of about a week's worth of groceries for a lot of people. For the price, it's not worth it at all, and it would not be something I frequent. I love hot dogs, I make them all the time, and I use Sucker Punch spicy pickles (I dice them into a relish), and it's my favorite fast food at home. With that said, I'm a bit picky with how I like them. I get the hype over this place but I do feel you're better off buying kosher or organic dogs and doing them at home. 

Flavors are good and fun to have them every now and then, but again, it's just way too expensive for some wieners. I am happy, though, for the owners and their success."}
{"text":"Omg this place is great. We had a baby shower here for work and it was amazing. This was my first time here, but not the last. Specialize in hotdogs, but out they had street tacos and corn esquite and it was my favorite."}
{"text":"Super busy, there was a line. But work the wait. Only thing is that it's a bit pricey paid 36 dollars for 2 hot dogs and 2 fries it was worth it! Customer service is really good which is why they deserve 5 stars. Food is served at a timely manner."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical eating here since everything was named \"Dirty\" or \"Dirt\" HAHAHA!

I tried the House Dog, Red Dog, Brown Dog ($5.95 each), and also their garlic fries.

Their House Dog was my fav! The sauce was creamy & good. The Red Dog was okay, definitely had a kick, and the Brown Dog was my least fav.

If you like sweet breads, I recommend getting the Portuguese bun.

The garlic fries.. The garlic sauce was soooo good! Next time I come here, I'm going to ask them if they can drench my fries with this sauce! Haha

I wish they had the Mexican drinks in their soda fountain machine though (i.e. Jamaica, Horchata, etc). They said they're working on getting those machines.

I'm definitely keen to try their Horchata Ice Cream next time I visit!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was super slow. The fries looked like a half order. The music was TERRIBLE. With better service, more fries and a change in music...would have gotten 4+ stars."}
{"text":"First time coming here, ordered the brown dog with a lobster bun, garlic fries, the corn esquite which is corn in a cup and the traditional dirty corn which is on the cob. I definitely loved how clean the place was and the server was very nice. The brown dog I ordered was really delicious it didn't have that salty taste like a lot of hot dogs do. But I definitely recommend this place and also it's very affordable."}
{"text":"Spending 6 hours at a bar you don't really want to order food from watching football is one way to work up an appetite, and that's exactly what I did last Sunday. Being in the state of borderline hangry status, I was very excited to finally try a dog at Dirt Dog. 

Like a true Yelper, I was figuring out what I was going to order before I even arrived. Green dog...red dog...-errr...should I go with the Mutt? I even showed the menu to my peers to help me decide, because let's keep it real, no one should be ordering the same thing. 

When I walked in, I FREAKED OUT when I saw there was a whole other menu (or 2) aside from what is listed online. \"There's an even dirtier dog?! And Tacos?! And dessert?!\" I found myself experiencing drive-through anxiety and ended up with the Elote dog on a lobster roll, with chili fries...and carne asada fries---- I dunno, it all happened so fast. 

Long story, short, delicious dogs and fries. Definitely hit the spot. Their dogs are Nathan's all-beef (and bacon-wrapped), so...yum. The only reason why I'm not giving it a 5 is because Dog Haus exisits...and I'm a true sucker for Dog Haus (1. they make their own dogs, 2. they have smaller portions available one can sample everything, 3. well, I'll save this for another review)."}
{"text":"This tiny nook is a bit of an Easter Egg hunt. It's located deep within the Grand Bazaar Shops of the Bally's Resort, across from Wahlburgers and next door to Fuel Bar and Sin City Brewing Co. You could walk right past it if you're not paying attention. The eminating french fry smell was what caught my attention and made me stop to look around, after which I spotted their hot dog display.  The place is so compact that it reminds me of a hole-in-the-wall I might find in New York City.  

I decided to try their House Dog (first item on the menu) with a side of lime seasoned Dirty Fries. The hot dog was juicy and the bread--which was grilled to a light crust--was soft and warm. The fries were fresh and delicious, albeit a tad too salty (they could have dialed back the seasoning). The dog's chile spread (a combination of what appeared to be chipotle mayo, green and red peppers, bacon bits and onions) was tasty but very messy. Although every bite was pleasant, it was a struggle keeping my hands clean. The \"dirty\" namesake makes more sense now.

If you like hot dogs, are looking for something quick, or are in dire need of an alternative to the plethora of overhyped and overpriced restaurants in the area, then Dirt Dog is your answer. Hot dog, fries and bottled water... $13. That's a steal of a deal on the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. I went to this place twice during my stay. Affordable and so TASTY. Had the deep fried oreos and the house dog. I can't get enough. Best food for when you're drunk"}
{"text":"Hot Dogs - Super Good, nice thick beefy hot dogs wrapped in bacon with all different topping. I had the Red dog and it was on point.

French Fries - Also super good, got the dirty fries and ate the whole box. Could go a little heavier on the toppings for the fries but over-all really great.

Dirty Corn - Kind of disappointing, it looks super authentic and appetizing but it was very dry and the seasoning was not strong enough. I think if they added on cream or mayo rather than leaving it dry it would have had more flavor.

Horchata - Creamy frothy goodness and possibly the best in Vegas

Had a great time and would definitely go back again, staff was super nice and friendly. Needs more seating though"}
{"text":"Dirt dog is top notch. The staff is friendly, the food is fantastic, and there is a fantastic selection of beer on tap!!!"}
{"text":"Ive tried Dirt Dog before but at a local carnival, they had a booth setup and it was delicious!! I had their dirty corn and it was amazing!!! So i figured i would try their actual brick and mortar place and i wasn't disappointed. I ordered a patty melt dog, garlic fries and their carne asada fries. All of it was super good.... Super rich and full of flavor! The garlic fries seemed to have actual fried garlic on them which you normally dont see. And the patty melt dog was something diffrent in a tasty way! This place takes the usual all american hotdog and turns it into an out of the ordinary meal! A must try!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great customer service, and 90s vibe. Girl running the cash register is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been here three times, all of which were spectacular! Really good hot dogs, I recommend The Green Dog and the Dirty fries! The corn is also really good!! A big shout out to Amber for giving us awesome service!! Will definitely be back and bring more friends :)"}
{"text":"100th REVIEW! Woohoo! (''( (^-^) )'')

Dirt Dog is damn good! Came here randomly after Facebook bombarded me with ads for the place. Do y'know which ones I'm talking about? ...You probably do. They're almost pornographic, in a food way.

But, anyway: I ordered the House Dog on a Portuguese bun with a side of Elote Fries.

Both were astounding! The hotdog was massive and packed with flavor. I sorta wish I had been a little more daring with my choice of dog though. The House Dog was tame compared some other options on the menu... But still tasty nonetheless!

Truthfully, it was the side of fries that stole the show for me. Just imagine: crispy, salted fries soaking up all the flavor from the creamy, lime-y corn. It's almost as if the two were meant to be combined!

I'll definitely be back to try some more."}
{"text":"Interesting menu for hotdogs.  We tried the street tacos but they were tasteless and dry. Tried the Ranchero dog and the brown dog.  They were both good.  I thought that it is a little pricey for a hotdog."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com!! It's very clean everytime I come in and the staff is always very friendly and welcoming.  

Menu
The menu is small so easy to pick from. Four different hot dog flavors to choose from plus a veggie option. Three different bun choices from. There are 6 different sides and four dessert options.

Food
The hot dogs are phenomenal!! I've had the green, red, and house so far. They have amazing flavors and the Portuguese bun is so yummy!  The red dog was very good and very spicy! I loved it.  I've had the dirty chips and the seasalt and pepper fries and both are to die for. The flavors used are so addicting!! I haven't had the desserts yet but it's definitely in the near future.

If your looking for something delicious to eat, look no further then dirt dog!!"}
{"text":"ate there today.  won't go back.  prices too high, atmosphere directed more to the rap crap crowd.  and that noise was too loud.  Soo, pricey food, and only one type of music played, that i don't like, won't be back."}
{"text":"The red dog and the mutt dog are perfect. The red dog is spicy so depending on how your taste buds are not to spicy to where I can't eat but just enough. The mutt is a mix between the red dog and the green dog. You can choose your bun. Lobster roll is the way to go. Also there churro ice cream is good a nice big serving I couldn't finish it all.  And don't skip out on the blueberry beer! Staff is friendly . It is always clean inside. Great for family or just hanging out with the buddies"}
{"text":"Everything i bit into was amazingly delicious. Their version of the chili dog was tastier than your average chili dog, the cilantro definitely elevates it.   Love love love the al pastor fries.  Wish i could bring home a bottle of the sauce they used.  My elote dog was messy but so fresh and tasty.  Cant wait to try more flavors.  The service was great, our cashier gave great recommendation of using the lobster bread (i could eat that on its own!) They were accomodating when they gave my husband extra chili when he said his chili dog didnt have enough and they continuosly checked on us.  My only critique would be I wish they had more seating options available.  We managed to get seating at the narrow table on the stools so i cant complain, but we saw many people arrive and leave because they could see there wasnt enough seating for their groups. I felt bad for them because these hot dogs and fries are Amazing! Also loved their horchata. Cannot wait to go back, but if there is not enough seating we'll be prepared to ask to take it to go."}
{"text":"I have to say it's a great place their hotdogs is awesome you have to try at their customer service is great straight to the place would you like to order you will love it I will do recommend my friends and family thank you for a great place........"}
{"text":"My wife and I like to go out to eat together, just us, both daughters are in school when we go. I like to call these \"Frances and Porter's Excellent Lunch Adventures\". Nine times out of ten it's for lunch. Nine times out of ten we say we are going to go to \"restaurant a\" and wind up going to \"restaurant b\" or \"restaurant c\". Always changing our minds.

BUT... thanks to YELP, I came across Dirt Dog, and we went straight there, no stopping. We says pictures of this place and had our minds made up. Turns out Dirt Dog's location is at a former hamburger joint that I just loved.

About 15 minutes after Dirt Dog opened for the day; we went inside and were immediately greeted. By a young lady in a halter top. If not for the fact that she was behind the counter, I would have thought her to be another customer. She was however very informative about the menu. Here's what we ordered.

Fran: The Green Dog: Chimichurri Sauce, Guacamole Spread with Garlic Fries

Porter: The Red Dog: Spicy Tomato Chile Sauce, Chipotle Sauce with Dirty Fires

The food is awesome people. The cost, just under twenty-five dollars!

Fountain drinks for beverages. Sodas, tea that sort. There is also a bar area.

The decor to Dirt Dog is pretty cool but seems unfinished. One wall has a floor to ceiling map of southwest Las Vegas. The other side of the room was a blank wall. Walking towards the restroom is an empty room. This appears to be a waiting room of sorts. A window for take-out at one end, door to the world on the other. A very large sticker of sorts is on a wall in this room. The sticker is of the Dirt Dog logo. But a good portion has come free of the wall. 

So here's the plus side: 
The Food

So here's what I consider to be a negatives:
No staff uniforms, not even name tags
Incomplete decorations on the walls.

If you find yourself in Southwest Las Vegas, venture down to Dirt Dog, the food alone is worth the effort and time."}
{"text":"Just going to say I love this place. It's across town from where I live but I'll go back there."}
{"text":"This place is dope! Walking in, you immediately recognize the urban LA-inspired decor; Tupac paintings, angels wings, and even West Coast rap playing. Anishia at the counter was hella friendly and informative, as we were first-timers to the restaurant. She thoroughly explained the options, ingredients, and top sellers and personal recommendations. 
Most importantly, the food was BOMB. Everything looked just as pictured online and on the menu; the tastes were just as vibrant. I had the Elote Dog, and the Dirty Esquite... delicious. 
I strongly recommend this place to anyone. Can't wait to come back and try some of the other hot dog variations. Maybe a street taco or two."}
{"text":"Seriously they need to bring this place to Northern California ASAP!

While visiting here in Vegas, my girlfriend and I decided to stop by. The lady at the front was super helpful and polite, explaining all of the bun options (I recommend the lobster roll). We ordered a mutt dog and a patty melt, along with two orders of dirty corn. Best hot dogs I've ever had, and the corn was seasoned to perfection. You can't be afraid to get a little messy because these hot dogs are definitely going to get your hands and face dirty with deliciousness. They also have some really tasty churros that come with Horchata whipped cream... so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start ? I first had these hotdogs at a baby shower! My best friend had them catered to her party and we all had the house dog. My first bite was so amazing ! Honestly, when she first said that she was going to have hot dogs catered I was not feeling it since I'm not a big hot dog fan! But no! I went in for seconds and the next day I decided to visit the place. Overall chill place, amazing friendly staff and the best food ! I had the house dog again with some spicy iguana sauce on the side and it was delicious! I've been here more than 10 times after the shower. So far I have tried everything on the menu and their food does not fail at all ! You will not be disappointed I guarantee. I recommended this place to all my friends and they all say the same."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!! 
Great service and great food! 
Not your average hot dog! Great way to make a hot dog taste better! Also desserts amazing! What a cool place! Stop in and try it out"}
{"text":"This place used to be the old Chee burger location when I was in high school. They have a pretty diverse menu of toppings and combinations (buns, cheese, etc) so it's not just some standard hotdog cart food. I never thought I would like hot dog joint, but holy hot damn I'm all for it. 
My recommendations are:
-Patty melt dog
-hot Cheetos eloté
-churros with the icing dip (mouthgasm) 
-eloté fries cause why tf not!?"}
{"text":"Tried for lunch today. I had the green dog, hubby had the red. We had fries and chips as sides. Both of dogs were quite good. Taste and decently big dogs. Bold but not too spicy for the red dog, enjoyable. The flavors of the green bled well with hot dog. When they say seasoned they mean it, I  love garlic, and they delivered with the garlic. Chips were fresh hot fried, fries could have been thinner and crisper for my taste. Would be 5 star if they had just a couple more choices. A plain dog, and maybe something very cheddar cheese loaded."}
{"text":"Best hot dog we've ever had! I got the house dog and my husband got the green dog. We also got the salt and pepper fries which were amazing! If you're debating on which bun to get you have to get the lobster bun so light and buttery (but not too buttery!) The workers were very friendly and had great customer service :) AND their churros are to die for!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight and this place was where the party was at!!  7:30PM on a Sunday night(Labor Day weekend but still) and there was not a table to be found except at the bar seating by the cash register.  This is our third time coming here and it is very cool,

I always get very filled up as my wife and I usually each get a dog(veggie one for me) and fries but we added the esquite corn and it was a complete meal.  The best thing about Dirt Dog is they have a soy frank but they will cook it on a separate grill so you don't get any meat lingerings from other orders.  The music tonight was pumping and two different football games on so just I don't get what their target audience is but nonetheless,  You want good hot dogs and are on the westside of town,  you will not find better.  They even serve BEER!!"}
{"text":"Let's start off that these dirty dogs are delicious. Another level of satisfaction when it comes to gourmet hotdogs with a middle end price for it. I like to share that all of the selections do have a spicy level to each item. Other than they're delicious dirty dogs, you should try out their selection chili fries and desert. For my first time there, I had to try out the signature items along side the all time public favorites. I started off with a house dog and dirty chili dog which both had a spicy-chorizo chili taste, then shred a batch of filthy fries topped with guacamole, chipotle aioli, cheddar and cotija cheese. I finished off with their sweet Horchata ice cream with churro. That cinnamon blend really puts flavor into my tastebuds. I ordered deep fried Oreos for the kids and they only come in 2 pieces. It was not worth the price for just 2 pieces... The whole thing actually cost me a total of $35 which is pretty pricy but it's always worth the experience. You might even become a regular here. Overall I bet this would be a perfect spot to watch sport games if they added more tv screens all over. They already have an alcohol license and beer to complement their foods.  They accept card and I experienced great table service."}
{"text":"My hubby had heard about this place & wanted to check it out. First, we were greeted immediately. The guy taking our order was awesome! Informed us what DD about, good things to try, etc. service is great here! 
We decided to try the elote dog & carne asada fries. I thought the dog was very flavorful! Quality beef dog with great seasonings, creamy sauce. A bit messy to eat but good! The carne aside fries were pretty good. The fries themselves were the seasoned kind that I love! They were cooked perfectly. More carne asada & sauce would have made them even better."}
{"text":"The house dog and the chili dog were really good. We also had the corn. Definitely a recommendation to go there and try it out. Excited to have something like this on our side of the town in the Southwest."}
{"text":"I love fancy hot dogs because plain hot dogs are just so boring. 

Clean establishment. Friendly staff and our cashier even made recommendations. I of course wanted to try everything there was. 

Ordered the first 4 dogs on the menu, garlic fries and the horchata/churro dessert. 
Verdict: 
My favorite is the green dog. Chimichurri sauce is amazing. Red dog was spicy as f but then again, I don't often eat spicy foods. The traditional house dog was fabulous and my least favorite was the brown dog. The flavor didn't pop. 

Garlic Fries - I prefer them nice and crispy. These are definitely not. And the garlic sauce that comes with it is okay. Maybe they need to chop the herbs in there a bit smaller. 

The dessert came out looking all wrong. I guess they were having problems making the churro so first came the horchata ice cream and then then a really over done churro. Way over done. The ice cream tastes like a vanilla ice cream with bits of sprinkles. Have you ever tried the horchata at Taco y Taco? That's like Christmas in your mouth. That being said, the dessert was very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We tried the filthy fries, which were pretty good, but we will probably try a different kind  next time. The mutt dog was bomb. It was spicy at the red end and mild as you got to the green end. Perfect combination! We also tried the ranchero dog. The ranchero sauce was delicious and had a little kick too! My only feedback is to have more than one register open and move the ordering to the side so the exit isn't so blocked in case of emergency."}
{"text":"Great service. The green dog was on point and the red dog was kick ass! The Corn was so delicious... but the best part was definitely the horchata & churo ice cream. We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I love their version of the elote corn aka. mexican corn with mayo, butter, that mexican cheese and some spice. It's delicious, it's near the house, and when I crave it I can get it. Unfortunately, it does take a whole lot of time waiting for the food because this place is always packed. It's worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Okay if you've read my reviews you know but if you haven't... Here you go. This is going to be divided into 3 sections:Vibe, service, and food.

Let's Go!

Vibe: 
So Dirt Dogs has a origin story coming from LA. The decor was made to make you feel like you we're walking on the street in LA. Coming from California I have to say I loved the decor. Although it seemed a bit cheesy it had a nice feel. There were 2 things that I really liked in the restaurant. One was angel wings painted at the back of the restaurant. It was a major photo op. Now the second was a pin wall the I absolutely loved. It was a map of some of Vegas that allowed people to pin their names to the wall. It was nice and interactive.

Service:
So dirt dogs has a cashier and a table service to deliver the food other than that there is not much employee customer interaction. In all honesty, I don't mind that at all. The employees are nice, helpful and prompt.

Food:
Now the thing you want to know about... How's the food?
It's fantastic! I went with my family and we ordered the elotes dog, and a patty melt dog. For the Patty melt dog, we ordered it with Texas toast which they refer to as lobster bread. It was so good. All their dogs are wrapped and cooked in bacon. The fries threw me off but it was good with the chipotle aioli was A1! Now the Elotes dog... I hate cilantro but on this hot dog? I couldn't even tell is was there. It was just like eating elotes. 

I loved my experience here. It was nice, chill, and I hope to come here again."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Food (hot dogs and fries) service (fast casual order at register then they bring it to your table) and decor is all pretty good. Price might be a little high but the food is better than avg. so I don't have an issue with it. They play a lot of hip hop and hardcore rap classics. They have a few TVs and some board/table games.

4/5 because of price for value and the ordering at register creates congestion at the main entry. 

Will go back again."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a hot dog person. It this place is off the chain!! The atmosphere is chill and the music is awesome! The dogs are freaking incredible and garlic fries are the bomb!! The churro and ice cream is so delicious! And I don't usually drink beer but they gave me a craft beer that was so smooth!! And So delicious!! Definitely a return customer!"}
{"text":"Great dogs and sides....we loved it! The dogs are delicious and very filling. The dirty fries are outstanding and filling as well!  Our only beef (no pun intended) was it's a pricey joint for hot dogs....a great business indeed!  Making lemonade out of lemons!!!"}
{"text":"I went when someone told me about this place. $7 for a hot dog. That's a bit much. Really it's a hot dog. Won't go back. It was good but it's still a hot dog."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, amazing service, lots of different choices and a really fun ambience!"}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked to try this place, but I'm not sure if I just ordered the wrong thing, but I was pretty disappointed. 

Mutt dog with lobster roll: first off, it seemed like I got the end of a bread or something because mine was way thinner than my boyfriend's and the hot dog fell apart after one bite, which was surprising because he got the chili cheese dog. This hot dog was supposed to be 1/2 green dog and 1/2 red dog. The red dog was so overpowering that I couldn't even tell it was a mixture, it felt like I only got the red dog. It was so spicy I couldn't even eat it. It  was so spicy I drank my water and also my boyfriend's water. 

Chili cheese dog: it was good. Mostly just tasted like a standard chili cheese dog. The lobster roll on this one is was way better. I wasn't amazed by it.

Elote fries: pretty good, I liked the mixture. 

The staff was pretty friendly and patient, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I love this little joint! Great food and friendly service.. Cannot beat that! This is one of my go to options Forsure!"}
{"text":"Finally made time to check this place out if even it wasn't on purpose. On our way to Cafe Zupas when we came up on Dirt Dog rather quickly, and I had seen this establishment on Yelp and had it bookmarked so when I noticed it on my right, I knew I just had to brake hard and make the right turn into the parking lot. As soon as my friend and I went in we were hit with some Tupac playing through the speakers. My friend was like, yeah this place has some flavor! So the menu is on the wall, with pictures to go with the description which I found very helpful, sometimes it's better to see  than read what you're ordering. My friend got the Dirt Dog, and I had the green dog and we ordered two tacos al pastor. The al pastor although good wasn't the best but this place is called Dirt Dog and we came for the dogs! Both our choices didn't disappoint, they were both delicious. They offer a choice of buns, I recommend the Portuguese bun for .50 cents more.  The staff were friendly and attentive, and multiple times asked how were doing and asked us how we heard about them. Dirt Dog is definitely a place we will frequent, make sure you give this place a visit!"}
{"text":"Food was really delicious. Took a little bit to get, but, delicious. 

Staff was very friendly, establishment was very clean. 

I ordered the green hot dog and dirty corn. Very tasty 

Definitely going back"}
{"text":"My friend had just gotten back from studying abroad and suggested meeting here for lunch. I had never heard of this place before, but I am glad I gave it a shot. The staff is super friendly and gives good recommendations. The prices are decent and reasonable, although I haven't been to a lot of specialty hot dog restaurants so I'm not sure how competitive they are. 

I had the green dog and corn as my side. My foot came out about ten minutes after I ordered it, but our service mixed my side up with my fiancés. On top of that, my fiances fries came out cold. Not lukewarm, but cold. 

I might return, but it's not really a place I see myself frequenting. It is worth going once, though."}
{"text":"Love the Ranchero dog, it has a fried egg on top with crispy tortilla chips! Also they got a patty melt dog and fried Oreos that keep calling me back :) yummmmeh"}
{"text":"Loved it...great hot dogs.  Garlic fries  are great.  I recommend highly for the hot dogs lovers."}
{"text":"Staffs are friendly and welcome me and my kids with a smile!!! And i guarantee their food is awesome! Everything is fresh! From breads to corns! Good job dirt dog!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Dirt Dog today to see what all the hype was about. I got the ranchero dog, cheesy corn, and garlic fries. First impression the atmosphere is awesome we thought the long line for food would make the wait forever but it moves very fast. We waited about five minutes total to order food which was great. The music was awesome all the employees were very friendly and the cook time for food took about five minutes for all four of my groups large order! It all looked very good almost identical to the menus pictures. The cheesy corn left a lot to be desired and the garlic fries were a little overpowered with spices and garlic. The hot dog which is what I came for was very good. All in all I had a pleasant experience but the food did not live up to the hype. I can see this as a once in a blue moon place to grab food but nothing more than that."}
{"text":"I love the decor. Ive lived in this area for a while and it took so long for me to come in here because I don't eat meat. The vegan tacos are to die for. The corn fries are also equally bomb. The service was amazing. We had many people in front of us and thought we would have to wait long but it was quick. It quality food fast. The fried Oreos my favorite. You have got to stop in here."}
{"text":"This is some seriously supreme street food, but served in a stylish, enclosed diner-like atmosphere.

And never fear - vegan options are here!

I tried the vegan carnitas tacos. They were fantastic, and topped with guacamole and a few not-overly crunchy plantains. I believe they were $2.00 each taco. 

I also was excited to test out the spicy eloté which is basically just corn engulfed in hot cheetos along with the other standard eloté toppings that street vendors usually include. I wasn't terribly impressed to be honest, but sometimes that happens when you get yourself too pumped up to try something new; you develop unrealistic expectations. However, it is a beautiful social media #foodporn photo post.

Speaking of social media, this location frequently utilizes Instagram to advertise their specialty items, and this successfully results in them being a thriving business. You may want to prepare for a large line at the register and no free tables, but maybe you'll get lucky?

I just love the art and alternative atmosphere. It's inspiring to see restaurants prosper when breaking away from traditional food service standards."}
{"text":"Delicious! House Dog, Patty Melt Dog, and Garlic Fries were delicious. Also, service was great and quick. I will be back."}
{"text":"Hot dogs with a twist! Found this gem near my house for a quick bite my family can enjoy. They also offer $2 tacos but we prefer the hot dogs and fries! Fast and friendly service, and I would reccomend to try everything on the menu! Bee  here twice and between me, the husband and the w kids weve already gone through a third of their menu!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed we drove from damn near mt Charleston because I love hot dogs and the hype about this place was huge we ordered our food and they wanted me to tip and leave a review before we even got our food or were served after paying over 50.00 for three dogs and three fries two of three buns were soggy and the \"waiter\" if you can call them that didn't seem to care at all let's just say me and my family will never return to dirt dog !!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! I could seriously eat here every damn day, it's really that good! I've been here multiple times and every time I haven't been disappointed. Does it get busy, yes, but it's worth it! The best part is the food, flavor and service is consistent. And consistent in a good way. This last time I decided to try the mutt dog and it was incredible and their in-house churro with that delicious and yummy! Would I come back, heck yes and very soon too!!"}
{"text":"My husband been wanting to try this spot and I must say it was extremely good. SADLY! Its across town for us however it definitely was worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is very clean 
Friendly staff. It was my first time and he explained the whole menu to me 
Tried the tacos. The al pastor is BOMB.
I tried the elote fries. It was a bit to much butter for me but still really good! 
Make sure you order Mexican coke with your food"}
{"text":"Stopped at the location in Vegas- SO GOOD. Have been wanting to go back ever since. Great twist on hot dog toppings and fast service. Nice and clean environment. Definitely check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The Veggie Dog , yes!!!!  I ordered it green style--avocado spread+chimichurri = awesome combination!"}
{"text":"This place ia amazing and the staff is so wonderful, friendly & welcoming.  I found this place through a facebook post they had and was like I got to try it.  If ur in the Vegas area and got a taste for a hot dog Dirt Dog is a must go to spot.  Trust me u won't be disappointed, I drove across town jist to try and will do it again."}
{"text":"So many ways to do a hotdog it was hard to decide. I had the elote dog and fries it was so good. The staff was really nice and food came out quick. I will for sure go back. Almost forgot they have beer on tap to."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I cannot wait to go back again!  The food was off the charts and the atmosphere was chilled and lates back."}
{"text":"Dirt Dog. Best hot dog I have had in Vegas.... actually anywhere! Best dog period. How can you go wrong with a quality hot dog then wrap it with bacon then sprinkle more real bacon bits on top of that....then add all the other toppings. DA BOMB. Then add the carne asada fries which were really crispy, lots of meat and then top it off with some pineapple bits....oh man was it good then top that off with a couple of deep fried Oreos. Booooom. Nap time."}
{"text":"Food and service was good.  Very unique combo of hot dog cooking.  Definitely will be back to try the other flavors!"}
{"text":"Service was super fast and staff was friendly. I appreciated that they took the time to come out and clear our table, ask how things are and make small talk. Food was awesome and the portion sizes were perfect for me. Little spendy but worth it for a nice lunch out. Loved the fried Oreos and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"You should definitely eat here if you are at the strip! Affordable prices and Yummy food!! 

Their Specialty Hotdogs (Dirt dogs) are all priced between $6.25-$7.25, and they aren't your average hotdogs, these are loaded with the good stuff. My favorite is the House Dog ( bacon thousand island, onion, bell peppers, green chile, of course bacon bits! , ketchup, mayo and mustard) and you can even choose a lobster bun for that! 

Sides - pleaseee get the Dirty Esquite! (Corn in a cup with cotija cheese, cilantro and chili powder) amazzingg! And the Filthy Fries (guac, chipotle aioli, cheddar and cotija cheese ) another one for the win! 

And of course, a meal won't be complete without dessert, at least for me, I ordered the Deep Fried Oreos served with Horchata Ice Cream and sprinkles, the oreo was not oily, and its freakin delicious!! 

There's few seating near by,but some days they fill up fast. Location is in the Grand Bazaar Shops, you can type in the address and it will take you there. 

The service is great! Friendly, welcoming and fast."}
{"text":"I'm not a big hot dog person for starters. So I was a little reluctant to try an all hot dog spot. But I saw an add for this place come across my FB and it had more content  than just your simple Nathan's hot dog. So we came in and I'm glad we did! 
The beauty in coming to a new spot with my spouse is we split. So I get to try more without stuffing myself. He ordered their red dog and I tried the green dog. We split the dirty corn, garlic fries and a Twinkie. Although it was so good we almost had to order two twinkles. 
The red dog was great. Nice and spicy, covered in bacon and veggies. 
The green dog was not spicy but had a zesty and refreshing flavor that calmed the spice from the red dog down. 
The garlic fries are plain fries with a delicious garlic dipping sauce so you can control how much anti vampire flavor you want. I will be getting TWO sides of this on my next visit.....it was YUMMY! 
The corn was missing the creaminess of the mayo that I'm accustomed to with street corn. That being said it was still very good. It came on a stick so it was easier to handle covered in cheese, bacon and cilantro. 
And lastly, when you come in save room for desert! I might have to stop in just for late night fried Twinkie runs....this could be dangerous! They serve it with a light dipping sauce that really complements the Twinkie. 
We've already picked out what we will be trying on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Dirtdog was an interesting, and tasty experience to say the least. Located on the southwest side of town, on rainbow and windmill. Walked in about 7:30 in the evening, and this place was packed!!! We had to wait about 15-20 minutes but worth it. I haven't seen hotdogs with the kind of toppings this place has.. definitely check it out if you're into something completely different than the typical hot dog meal. I played it safe and went with the dirty chili dog and it was amazing!! My friends went with the brown dog, and the elote dog and were equally impressed. They also have elotes and tacos available here!! We ordered carne Asada fries and filthy fries and it was so perfectly crispy and seasoned.. and we couldn't leave without the fried Oreos, which had a horchata cream with it. So good! Ambience is casual. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in Vegas for our anniversary and we decided to stop by this place to try the corn fused fries and hot dogs. We both got chilli cheese hot dogs which included bacon and shared the \"Elote\" fries and... woah, it must have been the best hot dogs and fries we've had in our life! It was so good we immediately wanted to order more to go but decided to just keep going back if we get hungry later. It was the best and we can not wait to eat here again whenever we're in Vegas. I'm starting to salivate just thinking of how good those hot dogs are! Fantastic service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"That was one dirty dog.  And I loved it.  My main man got the House Dog and I got the Red Dog.  We shared an order of dirty fries and a few bites of each other's wieners. Both were delicious, but if forced to choose, I would go with the House Dog.  Good mix of hot and sweet (1000 island).  Space is open, clean and chill.  Service was quick and friendly.  Best of all, a few good beers on tap to go with those spicy sauces and some bomb ass 90's hip hop, heavy on the 2Pac.  Never been a huge hot dog fan, but Dirty Dog has made me a believer.  Highly recommend this fun food joint."}
{"text":"Really great spot! I actually don't like hot dogs a lot but this place I could come back too. Service is good and lots of space. The deserts are a plus and they have a little bar for beers so that was a nice little add on."}
{"text":"This food is fantastic, the ambiance is great, super casual! The service is great and tons of options to choose from! Definitely coming back ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Their customer service is great! 
I hesitated on the fourth star because I'm not 100% sure how I feel about the actual food. It was good enough, but I'm not certain I feel it was excellent. 
Has a street food vibe, but comes across kinda cheap (in a non street food way). I was not a fan of their cheese sauce - was grainy - and everything else was kinda something I could have done on my own at home. 
I gave four stars because I definitely think that everyone should give them a try: they're good (enough) and the staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"5 stars for me!!! Found on Instagram- checked out yelp- drooled soooo much and finally came down. We got the house dog, the red dog, garlic fries, and the dirty esquite. So freaking good it's unreal! Completely lived up to my expectations and extremely well priced. Will be back a million times over!!!"}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped hot dog. Cheese. Peppers. Deliciousness in your mouth. Not much else to say. And chili fries. Never forget the fries."}
{"text":"If your looking for a change of pace this place is great.  Lots of dog choices.  Friendly staff and comfortable.   Stop in and try it."}
{"text":"Great dogs, interesting flavor combinations , a must try. Please come to the Midwest!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, Definitely will return. Staff was very friendly and service was fast. Food was great. My husband loved the red dog and dirty corn. They didn't have a problem making my son's (a picky-ish eater) house dog to his liking. Deep fried Oreos were a must try! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I only came here for tacos on a tuesday, the pictures looked pretty good. At 2 dollars a pop i was hoping to get my moneys worth. I did not. Not enough meat, not even close to the size of the pictures. I figure to get what i was looking for, i would have to order 8 tacos, and put the inside from 4 inside the other half. I was dissapointed and had to eat more food from home after my meal (of 4 half size tacos)"}
{"text":"Delicious. The best hot dog I've ever had. This location didn't have a couple items I wanted but their hot dogs are so worth it,  nothing compares."}
{"text":"Been here twice already, I love the elote hotdog! Also the garlic fries are really good. They always have a nice crowd in there, very popular. Friendly service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here, so I started off with the house dog and garlic fries.  Both were very tasty!  I like the fact that the dog itself is a premium dog and not just some run of the mill dog.  The bacon wrapping doesn't overwhelm the dog, rather it complements the overall flavor.  The fries were done well and the garlic wasn't overpowering.   Just the right amount of flavor.  The only reason you're not getting 5 stars is because you ran out of Twinkies!  :)  Took the fried Oreos instead and they were just fine."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite spot in town for a sloppy fat meal - what a top button buster! Chilli dog, carne asada tacos, corn esquite were all super good. We can't wait to eat the horchata ice cream next time!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. They take a hotdog and turn it into something I could never have come up with. The menu is simple but each variation has such a different and delicious flavor profile. Each hotdog is around 7$ which may seem pricey; however, quality surpasses the cost by a mile. I have been here multiple times and I am always impressed. 

I ordered the green dog and the red dog. The green dog was not spicy and had guacamole as one of the ingredients. The red dog had chili flakes and onions and peppers. I would order both again! This last time, I ordered the horchata and churro ice cream dessert. And omg the ice cream was out of this world. The churro was small and kind of just added a nice crunch to the dish. 

If you're in the southwest area, I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"So first of all food is very filling, you can get creative with the toppings you want on your hot dog like the choice of bread and all that, I like different types of desserts so the dessert have a nice twist here too. Deep fried Twinkie and Oreo so super good and served with a horchata whip cream."}
{"text":"Everything I've had has been amazing, so damn good I'm back in less than a week! Not your average hot dog that's for sure. Churros are amazing by the way!"}
{"text":"First of all the service was outstanding. Now on to the food. French frys were very good the hot dogs not so good. Three of us ate and all three hot dogs were dry and not a whole lot of flavor. Two ou of three buns were chared on the bottom. Will not go out of my way to go back there."}
{"text":"Hot Diggity Dog! Delish! Straight from LA to LV is the newly opened Dirt Dog & they can make a delicious Hot Dog bursting with flavor. A Chicago dog was requested in the car so I immediately thought of trying this place out. No Chicago Dogs here though, instead we found hot dog choices with with unique toppings & flavors. I tried the Brown Dog which is a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with grilled onions & peppers in Teriyaki Sauce topped with Sesame Seeds & Bacon Bits. Yes, more bacon.... I got this dog in a lobster bun which is a buttered grilled bun like you would use for a lobster roll. The Red/Spicy Dog, Green Dog & Garlic Fries were also tried at my table. There's definitely an LA feel to this place especially with an LA radio station playing while you eat. The servers were friendly & attentive. I did mention that sprinkled salt on the fries would add flavor if you didnt want to dip your fries in the yummy garlic dip. It was also hot inside, I guess if the front door closed it would automatically lock so it was kept open for a bit. I'm sure they are working on that but in the Vegas Summer Heat doors must remain closed! Also I didnt know that every hot dog is wrapped in bacon. My server told me that I should've been told that while ordering. Knowing that this place just opened & keeping in mind that everyone is new & learning, I wasn't upset & obviously I don't mind bacon because I ordered a hot dog that has bacon bits on it. Yes, we will return & I will be spreading the word about Dirt Dog. Who's ready to get dirty????"}
{"text":"I never crave hot dogs unless I consumed a fairly large amount of alcohol hours earlier. In that case bacon wrapped street dogs are the best! I was searching for cheap eats and this place popped up. 

The cashier asked if it was our first time, then proceeded to tell us more about the items on the menu. Every dog comes wrapped in bacon. They also have tacos. I went with the house dog, which is the closest thing to an LA street dog. Got it on texas toast! It was simple, yet really fresh and satisfying. I took a bite of the hubby's chilli dog, which was just ok. The winner was the elote in a cup. Convenient and delicious. 

One star off because it seems like the workers try to rush you out by clearing your table when you clearly have more food left. I get it. It gets busy, but let me enjoy my food. Also, modern places never have fresh aguas frescas...why?! A refreshing strawberry, pineapple or cantaloupe frescas would hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great!!! So many good options on the menu. Loved everything from the hot dogs to the tacos. Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"Great bar like Street FOOD & great atmosphere! I ordered the Vegetarian Tacos and I enjoyed the flavor."}
{"text":"Now I see why they have a great ratings! Today I tried this place and the food was awesome! I ordered dirt corn and red dog with garlic fries and regular fries! Yes! ( I'm a big fan of fries) the red dog was so good and I think this is the best hotdog bun I have tried in a hotdog! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Me and my family just had our first dirty dogs and they were awesome so was the corn and the freshly made fries!! Employees were super nice and helpful explaining items in the menu CA style spot love it will definitely be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here because Yelp recommended new restaurants that have been just opening. My husband and I love to try new food. We got every hot dog on the menu but the veggie one. The brown dog was our favorite. All of the hotdogs were good, though. The only thing I didn't like was the cleanliness and wait time. There were a handful of people already in the restaurant when we arrived. They had already been served. It took a good 20 minutes just for our order to come out. I mean..its just hotdogs right? The floor and booths were covered in crumbs and food. We couldn't sit down without wiping everything down. When we were finished eating, we went to throw our trash away and there wasn't a trash can. We asked and they said they don't have one for us to throw food away. That's odd but whatever. I would say the best part was the dessert. We got the deep fried Oreos and the horchata churro. Both were amazing. So much so, that I would return just for dessert.  If you like hotdogs, definitely try."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing customer service from Alex. We had a green dog (so good), a house dog (amazing) and a red dog ( good and spicy) with dirty corn (delicious), dirty fries (yummy fries with a kick) and sea salted and peppered fries (perfect for the kids). Delicious! Alex was amazing and brought food out as it became ready, which was great for us since we had the kids with us....they were busy on chowing on dirty corn while we waited for our dogs. I was able to sample a few beers to pick the one I liked most, which made it easier for me to enjoy. Alex was super friendly and made the atmosphere light. If we needed anything, we knew we could ask Alex and he would deliver with a smile. Thank you!!! Keep up the great work, man!"}
{"text":"Honestly there's not much to review since there's technically not a building you walk into. It's on the outdoors at the strip. 
Fore the quick service that I received it was good. The menu was full of goodies and the desserts looked awesome. I received the loaded fries which were yummy. There's a seating area for the surrounding restaurants but the good thing is they will bring it to you in that area."}
{"text":"Dirt Dog is fun, funky and delicious. The service was great and the food was definitely worth going back for. We were a group of 5. We ordered two kids meals, one chicken nuggets and one with corn dogs and the portions were quite generous, they loaded it with fries so my girls were happy. My son went for the patty melt hotdog and it was amazing, I had to sneak a bite because he was not interested in sharing. I ordered the carne asada fries and they did not disappoint, it was a good serving of fries and a large portion of carne asada and toppings. My husband ordered their elote esquite which is corn in a cup with bacon and he ordered the original dog, he also was not interested in sharing because it was so good but he is obligated to share so I can confirm it was as tasty as he claimed. 

The only drawback - the restaurant is small and the place is popular so for a larger group like ours, we had a problem finding a place to sit and eat together. So as much as I would like to go again I need to find a better time when it is not as busy so we can eat without feeling rushed."}
{"text":"This restaurant was everything I had hoped it would be. Very cool LA atmosphere, card/board games to kill time, and kick ass food!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Yum, was a little skeptical- but glad I gave it a try. Had the house dog, dirty corn, and garlic fries I would recommend them all!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since i've been here, but the place has really turned around! I love the concept of \"LA Street Food\". It's like a stationary food truck with seating. The menu has expanded, and there's some really delicious dogs and even tacos now! Who ever decided to add the tacos was right on the money. 

I was here for lunch and the place was packed with a like out the door the entire time. I wasn't too sure about the place last time I came, but i'm glad I came back. 

ProTip: The taco menu is hidden at first. Look on the other side of the door."}
{"text":"This place has good food. Try it, you won't be disappointed. Maybe one day they will put a location on the north side of town."}
{"text":"This place is so good if you like a good hot dog (gourmet).  The staff is really nice and this place is clean. The dogs are so good just a real quick suggestion I hot the red dog it's HOT so do not get it if you do not like HOT. 
They also have some good sides and desserts. 
We will be coming back to this place again to try another dog."}
{"text":"So I am not a huge hot dog person, but OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Came here for the first time today with my husband, and we were not let down. From the time we entered the staff was nice, and did a great job explaining what makes them different. The food was the shining star, we had 2 different extra dirty dogs and split them and a side of dirty fries. Each dish was unique and very flavorful. We will definitely be back as this is a crave-able hot dog I can get behind :)"}
{"text":"Flavors are bold while remaining distinct, they don't dumb it down with sweetness. Good snap to the dog. The red sauce has a bite. The lobster bun is worth the addition, it doesn't taste like lobster, it is the type of bun lobster is often served in. 

The corn-off-the-comb is a great side. Fatty and sweet. Good way to cool down off the spicier dogs."}
{"text":"Such a great hot dog place! Tried the Dirt Chili Dog, Elote Dog & the Dirty Fries. Everything was amazing. Food doesn't sit heavy in your stomach, not overly greasy. Tons of flavor. Very nice people. Not a long wait for food. They brought our fries out first since they were done before the hot dogs. Nice to have the food come out hot off the grill/fryer/kitchen. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not really a hotdog kinda girl but I absolutely LOVE this place!! It's a hidden gem. Their green dog is sooooo good. I've been meaning to try their other hotdog options but I can't get enough of the green dog. Bell peppers, bacon and a bunch of other goodness wrapped in your choice of roll. I prefer the lobster roll. Mmmmm..... I also enjoy their Dirty corn (Mexican style) and Horchata ice cream with a churro on the side. Again mmmmm... The atmosphere is very nice. Cute place that plays old school hip hop. The staff are always friendly when I come here. My only complaint or I shouldn't say complaint is I wish they had a location closer to my side of town. I only get to visit every blue moon when I'm running errands on the southwest side. Oh well.. (Shrugs shoulders). Great place! Great Food."}
{"text":"First and foremost, let me say that the Horchata ice cream gives me LIFE!  What better way to live my best life than indulge in this creamy, churro concoction of perfection.  Don't even get me started on the Elote Dog....it was a life changer. I walked out of this place a more positive person with a new outlook on life.  If you are looking to live your best life...start with the best hot dog and ice cream you've ever tasted. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try something new and decided to check out this hidden gem. It wasn't hard to find but it is hidden away, so if you're not using your GPS or paying attention then you may miss it.

I visited the restaurant around lunch time and I was the second customer in. Everything in the store was nice and clean, and the women behind the counter greeted me with a smile. After looking around for a few and checking out the menu. I informed the young women that this was my first time here and asked if she had any recommendations. She offered everything on the menu, and then told me her two favorite items. She also informed me that all of their sausage dogs are wrapped in bacon and the lobster buns are her favorite (b/c they are more buttery and softer than the others). Once I placed my order I sat down and my food was out in no time. 

The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and the food was good. If I am ever graving a yummy sausage dog again, I will defiantly return."}
{"text":"You can say for certain this is a taste of California street food truck style recipes. Came in for my first dirt dog with my lady, the presentation is on point every thing that you order comes out looking like what they named it to the T. For me I guess I have had better hotdogs. It just seemed like the hotdog itself was extremely salty so any of the condiments or garnish you could possibly order you can't truly taste due to the saltiness. The idea is one of a kind I give 5 stars for creativity but the taste counts too! For example all I could taste on the Elote Dog was the cotija cheese and high amounts of sodium, usually corn is sweet  it was like extra filler corn very bland."}
{"text":"I thought the food was alright. We ordered filthy fries, carne asada tacos, tacos al pastor, chicken tinga tacos, elote and their esquite as well. We also ordered 2 coronas, which didn't come with limes, so we had to ask for-however, we were only given 1 single lime. When we asked for more limes, they decided to bring another one-piece of lime-what a waste of labor and energy.

The fries were salty, but somehow they lacked in flavor. The tacos were alright, but they were not that good to die for- I personally liked the chicken tinga the most-as it was the most flavorful one. The elote was bomb actually though, and so were the esquites-even thugh they were a little too watery. 

The complaint I had was about their service. Apparently, my friends who have previously visited this place mentioned their service was good and so were their food. However, the service on the night we went was just mediocre. The server was slow, and nowhere to be found when needed. Our table was not cleaned in time. The floors were dirty, and not a single bottle of sauces were refilled. 

It is very conveniently located from my house, so I would definitely come back, but I wish they had table service in order to offer better service, or better service in general at least ."}
{"text":"Food was good. Price was good. Expected a little more taste but overall a good place to eat when wanting a hot dog w a twist. Their food choices are more than I expected."}
{"text":"This place has it going on BIG time. 
The hotdogs were all legit. Don't even bother to get it without the lobster bun, because I think that's what complemented the dogs in a perfect way. 

The corn on the cob was out of the world. However, my second attempt, they somewhat skimped on the sauce and cheese, so it wasn't as good. 

The horchata whip cream is like crack. The deep fried oreos and twinkies were amazing, and by far the best I've had. As for the churros, they seemed a bit burnt. The second time I ordered it, it was the same, so must be something about the dough/temperature of the oil.

The fries were legit, and so were the chips. You can't go wrong here, and the price is reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the service and food were wonderful both times!

It's a place where you can order gourmet hot dogs and wonderful corn filled with other ingredients like Elote to make a wonderful combination.

They play hip hop song with fits the theme since you see a picture of Tupac near cashier which sets the style of music they play.

It's a nice place to get your craving for delicious hot dogs with delicious desserts like Horchata Ice Cream and Churro.

Highly recommend these place! I ordered The House Dog and The Green Dog, both have a delicious flavor!"}
{"text":"Ok, first off- they don't have much stuff on their menu, but then again, their food is quite addictive so you just want to go back ordering the same stuff over and over again. Lol

Staff is super friendly and nice- we actually had a chat with them and my husband suggested to put a Chilean style (streetfood) hotdog on their menu. 

The place wasnt that crowded (its probably because its new)- and its nice and clean.

This couldve been a 5 star review, however, the music was TOO loud (we had to move to another table so we're not close to their DJ booth) and our daughter was with us, and she was pretty irritated and she wanted to go home because of the noise."}
{"text":"Dirt Dog was probably one of the best meals I had while in Vegas. I couldn't believe how good everything was. The chili was amazing, the flavor was really good and the fries were crispy and seasoned. We split an order of fries but still couldn't finish them. For such a great meal the prices were great as was the location. Stop by but be ready for a possible food coma."}
{"text":"This place has the best hot dogs and fries in town! We will continue to come back! Service was amazing and everyone is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, rad music, and GREAT service.  Got comp'd some ice cream for my little ones because of the wait.  Got the elote dog and holy shit, SO MUCH FLAVOR!  The girl at the register and the dude that brought our food out were both very polite and helpful.  This experience was worth every penny.  Coming back here every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"The lady at the register was really nice to us when we arrived. It was our first time so she took her time explaining the variety of dogs. Once we ordered we received our food fairly quickly.  It's a nice little spot but a bit over price. Overall it was a great experience and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This place it's soooo good! Had to come back and bring my bf after the elite event. 
Love the atmosphere, very chill, old school hip pop playing in the background and good vibes. 
The ELOTE DOG is a must with lobster bun! This one was my favorite, my bf had the chili dog and garlic fries, they were good as well. Also, the deep fried Oreos are a must! Plus friendly and fast service!"}
{"text":"I Love this place! The food is always A-M-A-Z-I-N-G and the staff is very friendly. Austin is especially courteous of making sure the customers are always satisfied. We have tried almost everything on the menu and have enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"A co-worker mentioned this place that \"I HAD TO TRY!\" So we did!  We were greeted by Anesha (I hope I spelled it correctly) who was very genuinely personable, inviting and very friendly.  She gave us explanations of what was on the menu, which we so appreciated! We ended up with  the House Dog, Elote Dog, Elote corn and garlic fries...soooo yummy!   We will definitely be going back with our families."}
{"text":"Dirt dog didn't again !!! Amazing food .. I always got the Original hot dog but, now I am in LOVE with the elote hot dog ! Amazing !Great selection of beer. The customer service is always on point especially Austin he is the best always takes care of us and chats it up ."}
{"text":"Tried three dogs and the garlic fries. The house dog is slammin. Not for salad eaters"}
{"text":"My parents came to town and my dad loves hot dogs, so we finally got to try this place. 

Ordered the dirty fries, a house dog on a lobster roll, a house dog on an original bun, and a green dog on an original bun. The house dogs were very messy but so tasty. The dirty fries reminded me of Five Guys Cajun fries. The green dog was my personal favorite- guac and chimichurri are great flavors to pair with a hot dog. 

The atmosphere is definitely geared toward the younger crowd, with rap and house music. 

Sadly, they forgot all about my dad's dog. Mom and I were almost done so my dad decided to ask about his. They apologized and made one right away. Also gave my dad a free drink to make up for it. Great service, nice guys."}
{"text":"\"When I was.. a young boy, my father.. took me into the city, to see the\" dirtyyyy dog. Going to LA is one of my favorite experiences: relaxing at night on the beaches, trying all the great food, and indulging in the California lifestyle. One visit at the flea markets is when I first had the California dirty dogs. A mexican creation of a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with crema, avocados, and onions is what make childhood memories great. Hearing that we were having an establishment named after this delicious treat, makes me utter a phrase I thought I'd never say, \"I need some of that weiner!\"

Setting: Incredibly difficult to find, and placed in a terrible location. From blue diamond, it is the first plaza on the right where the bar and the pho place is. From 215 the last plaza on the right before you reach blue diamond. 

Interior: Huge, and very open with tvs posted throughout the space.

Service: There was 2 parties in the restaurant and it took about 20 minutes for my food to come out. I mean for a hotdog and a corn on a stick you'd think they'd come out much sooner than that.

Food: I got the house dog and the loaded elote. Elote: super weak, it pretty much is just a normal piece of corn, decorated with flavorless ingredients and really disappointed me. The House dog was ok and the topping added it to it made it all taste the same rather than having each ingredient stand out.

Overall: I won't be coming back here, I hear steamie weenie has a jalapeno jelly hotdog with other fixins that I'm going to check out next."}
{"text":"We tried Dirt Dogs on Rainbow Blvd. In Las Vegas  today for the 1st time. The food and service was exceptional! We will tell everyone how great this place is and we will return frequently."}
{"text":"Great job Dirt Dog!  The corn is ON POINT!  Great dogs. Friendly service. So glad to have this place down the street from my house."}
{"text":"You would think that making a perfect hotdog would be standard but it's not. This place is amazing.....waaaaay too much Tupac though..oh yeah F the lakers"}
{"text":"Great tasting dogs, fries, and Esquite! I'm not sure how this place compares price wise to their LA location but the prices seem a bit steep. $6.35 for a hot dog, $3.35 for regular sides, and $5.50 for the \"extra dirty\" menu. The flavor is there for me, just not sure I can justify these prices if I brought my whole family. All in all I will come back sans kiddos!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! This place rocked my life!! I can't believe there's one back home in LA and I'm trying it for the first time in Vegas! We had the Green Dog, The Dirty Chili Dog, and a plain bacon wrapped hot dog (for my 6 year old) The Filthy Fries, two Dirty Corns and one Dirty Esquite. All that and not one complaint!! The flavors were amazing. Not only was the food outstanding the service was also impeccable. The lady at the register (who happens to be one of the owners) was incredibly helpful and explained all the items, as well as suggesting their popular items. This place was so good that if they didn't have one in LA I'd be super bummed! But knowing I can have this whenever I want once I'm back in LA makes me do a little happy food dance!!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to go here for a while now and I'm glad we finally tried it out. Really good quality hot dogs and good ingredients. I like that they were not too big, honestly. I got the green dog and was expecting it to be a little spicy but it wasn't. Needed more lime too. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because all the different flavors are a bit too much. I'll definitely go here again though to try out more dogs! Also great service."}
{"text":"My lady friend and I came in here earlier this evening for dinner, and let me tell ya the hot dogs, or should I say dirty dogs did not disappoint! 
I got the patty melt dog on a lobster roll and she got the ranchero dog on a regular bun and trust me it really hit the spot, plus neither of us had eaten all day and it filled us up so that's a plus!
We also got the carneasada fries which were odd... I mean the fries were great, the meat was great, but together something seemed a little off. The more we ate it the more we questioned whether or not we really enjoyed them. 

However 5 stars solely for the hot excuse me I mean dirty dogs! We will definitely be back and we look forward to trying their desserts which looked bomb to say the least!"}
{"text":"This place is yum.... House dog was on point... Corn was amazing... Fries were great... Ask about the secret menu..my husband had the red&green dog YUMMY will be back..."}
{"text":"Can one review a place after only trying it once? What if it was really, REALLY good? I don't even like hot dogs but I have been wanting to return to Dirt Dog since trying it couple of weeks ago.
I had the Patty Melt Dog, Garlic Fries, Dirty Corn, and a Churro. All were freaking good! It was a bit too much food for me but I was feeling greedy and wanted to try everything...
Even aside from the toppings and the lobster roll bread and all the toppings, the bacon wrapped hot dog is the best I've ever had. This is the first time in my life, I am craving a hot dog! 
The garlic fries is worth to crave as well. Not your typical garlic fries, it's fried to perfection and tossed in garlic oil (made in-house!).
The restaurant seemed quite busy, with a steady flow of customers. There are tables and bar seating available. The restaurant also serves beer - perfect partner to a hot dog."}
{"text":"The hot dogs here are so flavorful and the bread is perfectly toasted. They have a great spin on food and offer vegetarian options! Their dirty corn was definitely different from your average elote but it was very smoky and the bacon bits were a great touch! Definitely love their French fries."}
{"text":"Solid spot. Food is really good staff is awesome. Pretty cool place on the inside the only thing I don't like would have to be how dirty some of the tables are. But they do were 805 my favorite bee... UPDATE TRIED TO CALL AND PLACE AN ORDER SINCE THEY WERE SO PACKED. I couldn't help but notice them just pick the phone up and set it down.. talk about great customer service."}
{"text":"Cool place, very friendly staff, decent dogs, very very slow service! Hot dogs are the easiest and fastest food to prepare, yet they managed to make us wait 20 minutes, and bring us a split order in two trips, which is one of the worst service faux-pas, it's never a good thing to have to start your dish because you don't want it to get cold while your spouse or date is staring at the ceiling...
Has to resolve this issue if the place is ever going to succeed, and I truly do wish them success."}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews I decided to make the drive from Summerlin.  Arrived here Friday night with the family and we ordered 2 kids meals, elote fries, dirty esquite (elote in a cup), dirty dog, green dog with fries and drinks. The bill came to about $40, which was a little pricey for just 2 hot dogs, 2 sides, and 2 kids meals, with 5 drinks.

Break down:
Dirty Dog and Green Dog tasted very salty and not sure if that is how it is supposed to be or if the cook had a very off day. My wife and I couldn't continue with the punishment.

Dirty Esquite and elote fries was ok

kid's meal #1 mini corn dogs with fries and oreos - looks like Vienna sausages battered; was a hit, my son loved it

Kid's meal #2 chicken nuggets with fries and oreos.  My daughter said yuck to the chicken nuggets and will not order again.

All in I don't think I see myself driving back here a second time.  Thanks Dirt Dog, I love the atmosphere and the place looks great, but Yelp is about food and I don't see higher than two stars."}
{"text":"I walked in expecting to enjoy a hot dog and explore a bit. I never looked at the menu just wanted to go in blind. Immediately as you walk in the line was almost out of the door. People excited to make their choice and indulge a bit. The weather broke and was a cool 90. The place was packed which is a good sign 2 PAC blasting and reallly cordial staff. I ordered  and I will not lie I was surprised at the size and the ability of the cooks to fashion this piece of art on a Texas toast bun. Literally, the food came out and my clothes came on. I was very aroused by my food. The ladies behind the counter warned me to put my clothing back in and so I obliged. Then enjoyed my delicious food. The hot dogs and their topping complimented one another how a Victoria secret models wings, panties, and bra compliment their bodies. As my food was demolished in by inch and the dogs and beer made their way down to my belly like George Washington attacking the British red coats. I was finished and satisfied. The sexy hot dogs had made their way down the runway and back. Residing now in my belly. Then came my deep fried Oreos with honey butter (I believe). I nearly fell out of my chair and offered my body as sacrifice to the aztec god quetzalcoatl. They made love to me orally and washed down elegantly. I will say I was spent after my indulgence here. I will not stop coming here and I will recommend it highly to any hot dog lover. Bravo."}
{"text":"Very yummy.  Friendly staff and food was fresh.  We will definitely come back to try some other selections of hot dogs.  Good job and goodluck"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while and I'm glad I finally did as it did not disappoint! 

I had the patty melt dog which was super bomb! A little hard to eat because it was so big but that's not really a bad thing! The regular bun held up really well and was so soft and tasty even on it's own. 

I also had the dirty corn which was ok, it wasn't the best thing ever and I would probably just order something else next time instead. 

The horchata was really good. 

We came on a Friday night and it was very busy so there was limited seating. The service was great everyone was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"First time coming to Dirt Dog, great selection and tasty hotdogs. If you like spicy, I recommend to ask for the secret menu (green dog/red dog combo...my favorite!)
Amber was very courteous with great customer service!!"}
{"text":"The hot dog here are delicious and tasty...yummy!!! We love it :) Friendly staff at the cashier ordering. Clean! Although, one little thing I need to mention the trash can or waste bin are inconvenient for customers.  They only have one and it's all the way near the restroom."}
{"text":"Good food will def be back and they have the games on!!! It was a little far from my house so we weren't sure it would be worth the drive but after eating there I would have to say it's def worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Best beef hot dog place in the city reasonable price fresh food really great environment I love my whole experience it was my first time going there today and trust me I will be back I'm from Chicago and we love our hot dogs and they got Mexican corn"}
{"text":"Man this place is just awesome. Everything from the service to the atmosphere is an A+. Great food. My fiancé and I have been wanting to try this place and we finally took the drive across town Friday night for a little cheat meal/date night. When we got there man it was busy but the staff is great so the line moves quick. Since it was our first time we wanted to try quite a bit so we ordered the patty melt dog, the dirty chili dog, the dirty corn, and the filthy fries. We held off on dessert to see how big the portions were. MAN these hot dogs are huge and sooooo good. Everything was amazing. We were both so full at the end of our meal we didn't get dessert.. BUT next time for sure. This place is amazing. Definitely go try it out for yourself. A+ all the way around."}
{"text":"Omg what great customer service!!!!! First time here and I can't wait til I try this amazing food that I've heard so much about. Stay tuned"}
{"text":"This review is long over due but so far I been here twice. I have to say their hot dogs are AMAZING!!!!! I can't seem to find anything like this around here. I really hope your business grows. You have great staff  I am always telling people about your horchata ice cream!! I have never had anything like it before! But overall you guys are worth more then 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, down to earth atmosphere and I like that it's super chill inside and being from LA it's nice to see LA food restaurants bring their business to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"These dogs are awesome!! I was a little hesitant when I found out the chili dog had cilantro on it, but it turned out to be amazing!! The cilantro gives the chili an extra pop that was perfect!! The elote dog was a perfect combo of sweet and salty! The service was awesome. Everyone was super nice and polite. The food came out fast and was hot. The atmosphere is laid back and very LA. I will definitely be bringing more people!!"}
{"text":"It's honestly the best gourmet hotdog in Vegas! I was a little lost when I came in but was quickly helped by a very friendly lady who explained me the different buns and what a few of the ingredients were. We ordered 4 dogs, being two wrapped bacon dogs; one house dog; and one elote dog without chili powder, and also garlic fries along with drinks. 
The food came out pretty fast and OH MY GOD! I felt like I was in hot dog heaven! :) Everything was perfect and very, very tasty! 
We were constantly checked on by one of the ladies which just made the whole experience better.

As for the place itself, it's s really cool place with lots of murals and the colors along with the decoration were very harmonious. The only one thing I didn't like much was the bathroom because it was a little too dark. I saw a baby changing station, which was great, but in a kinda dark place I think it would be a little uncomfortable to change a baby. 
Still, it's a must try if you like gourmet hotdogs!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place the other day thanks in large part to the pictures of it always posted on the UNLOKT Instagram account. We were not disappointed! It was every bit as good as they make it look. Great all-beef hot dogs, 3 choice of buns, plenty of sides and beers to choose from too. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had lunch at the Rainbow location today. Holy Moly! What a great place. The service was amazing! The atmosphere was awesome! But most of all, the Patty Melt Dog was literally the best hot dog I've ever eaten. I can't wait to go back again... and again.. Do yourself a favor.. EAT AT DIRT DOG!... do it."}
{"text":"The best dogs ever and the desserts are amazing. The dogs are covered in gourmet toppings and three different bun options. Not recommended if your are eating kale only as a dinner option. A must for something out of the norm."}
{"text":"Super delicious hotdogs!! This is a must place to eat no matter if you're visiting or a local! This place is originally from LA, haven't been to the original location, but if this location is this delicious I can't imagine how good the original location is!! It's a little south from the strip, but I saw online they built one on the strip! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after seeing some Instagram photos of the new Flamin' Hot Cheetos elote! As soon as we walked in, Tupac was playing and we immediately loved the vibe inside this hidden gem. Myself and another ordered the Patty Melt Dog on Texas toast, and a friend ordered the Elote Dog. The Patty Melt dog was to die for!! It was wrapped in bacon, topped with cheddar cheese fries and a chipotle aioli. Our friend said his elote dog was also delicious, the perfect balance between sweet & savory. We each ordered an elote, I got the classic Dirty Corn which did not skimp on the cotija cheese or yummy spices. We also ordered both of the new elote (not on the menu, it's the \"secret menu\" as the cashier told us). One was a Cheesy Cheeto elote, rolled in Cheetos and topped with melted cheddar cheese. The other was the Flamin' Hot Cheeto elote, rolled in Hot Cheetos and topped with melted cheddar cheese. Both were OUT OF THIS WORLD. They have soda in glass bottles, a good selection of beer, and did I mention Fried Twinkies?! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Good food, service (ordering over the phone) could have been better. But the food was good.. that's all that counts right?"}
{"text":"On a random mission to find something to eat .. My boyfriend & I turn into the complex. We walk in & look at the menu, then decided to get the House Dog with the lobster style bun, the Brown Dog, Dirty Esquite (Corn in a cup), garlic fries & the horchata ice cream 

Everything was really good! My favorites were of course the corn + the horchata ice cream!!! The ice cream came with a warm churro on top plus rice crispies mixed in with everything. The prices were reasonable not bad at all. Very spacious restaurant because my daughter was running everywhere  

The staff was nice too! The only thing I didn't like was the mustard on the hot dog but aside from that I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great people, great food .  The Green dog is mu favorite and the elotes! Must try this place!"}
{"text":"Great spot for gourmet dogs! They also have tacos now! If you like gourmet dogs than you should go here. The staff is great and friendly and there is a nice variety of beer."}
{"text":"Awesome dogs, friendly atmosphere and great place to get a quick bite! Very creative recipes and flavorful food."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for lunch with a large (8 ppl) crowd. The place isnt huge inside but we found plenty of sitting. The food was really good, not one complaint from the group. Between the group we tried the garlic fries, dirty chili fries, elote and 3 different hot dogs (some ordered the same thing). Only thing we didnt get was dessert. I got the elote dog on a lobster roll, delicious! The restaurant is LA based and played top hits from the 90's. Staff were very friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for awhile. I must have seen it on TV. I got the veggie dog \"red\" I know what I think to be a Portuguese roll. I am from Chicago so we are quite big on our hotdogs. This was nothing like I am used to, but it was sooooo good! We also got an order of dirty fries. And while we were sitting there eating somebody came out and said the kitchen made too much french fries would we like another. My friend and I were already splitting the container of fries , yes ,I said container. I told my friend just go ahead and bring those home for herself because I still had an almost full container after two people ate them. The hot dog was so humongous that I brought some of that home as well. Have your appetite ready if you go to this place."}
{"text":"This place has a great modern atmosphere and accommodating staff. I ordered the Dirt Dog and the Veggie red dog. The meat on the Dirt Dog was good, but nothing to write home about. The toppings of thousand island, bacon, and the Portuguese bun created a pretty sweet and savory meal, but very sweet. The veggie dog was a soy dog was basic and toppings took the show there, again, but was expected. The veggies were cooked with a good firmness. I was told the \"red\" was a mild spicy, but it came out a little too spicy. I would say an 8 out of 10 scale. My first veggie dog had an obvious hair on it when I opened the box, and it wasn't even busy. The staff was very accommodating and replaced it as well as refunded the entire bill (16 dollars was a surprise for two hot dogs) without me asking or fussing. I do appreciate that level of anticipation."}
{"text":"After coming here for an elite event I fell head over heels in love with the Elote Dog and was in need of another visit. I brought the boo along this time and we came on a Saturday around 1 pm. The seating can fill up pretty quickly, but luckily we were able to grab a spot. I love the vibe, super chill and lots of Tupac. 

This time around I also tried the garlic fries. I thought the taste of the fries were ok, but they were just missing some type of delicious dipping sauce. (3/5) The Elote Dog, my one true love, was just as good as I remembered. (5/5) You HAVE to get the lobster bun, it's so freaking good and no it doesn't actually have lobster in or on it. 

I wish this place wasn't so far from my house, but maybe it's a good thing since I'd definitely be broke and 20 lbs heavier."}
{"text":"Best hot dog we've ever had! They totally fooled us up and were delish! I hand the mut and my husband had the ranchero we also had the corn esquite and cheesy corn! Also they have beer options which is great! It was my husband birthday and they brought him some deep fried Oreos!! Service was awesome! The inside is cool! Totally reminds me of Cali with great music!"}
{"text":"Good food just needs some music although we did come a hour before closing but still the experience should be until the end. But overall great food and plenty of room and the staff is nice well the cashier was maybe a little too nice maybe just chill a little bit and let the food do the talking sometimes that's all a great place needs. Will recommend"}
{"text":"Good things and bad things about this place. which I ferociously consumed within the last 5 minutes. First it's overpriced. Owners have to remember that in the end they are still serving hotdogs. I mean I paid close to 30 dollars for 2 chili dogs, an order of chili fries, and deep fried oreos. Now I know what everyone must be thinking that's alot of food for 30 dollars. No it wasn't sadly. As a former professional chef I can understand food costs and making sure your turning a profit or attempting too as a newly opened business. However, giving me a very small dessert box with 20 small broken french fries that came from the freezer covered in a small amount of chili is not worth 6 dollars to me, it's just not. I won't completely bash the fries, the little bit of chili I did have was delicious.

 The dessert, ahhh the lovely taste of cookies dipped in a sweet batter and deep fried, served with horchata whipped cream. What could be wrong with that? Well again with the cost. I will say nothing more other than I think that 4 to an order based on the cost would be generous.

The chili dogs. Well the menu stated house made chili with melted bacon cheddar cheese. Chili was on point meaty, savory, everything you could want in a good house made chili. The cheese, again delicious. The bun, a lightly buttered split top bun that held everything together nicely. The dog itself was all beef which is expected, juicy, with a nice snap to the casing. But, there was another flavor involved. A spicy, unwanted flavor, which I discovered was an undisclosed jalapeño mayo of some sort. The problem I have with this is that it was undisclosed but most of all took away from my ability to enjoy it without taking a sip of my drink halfway through chewing because of the heat. Oh and they hotdogs were 8 dollars a peice. 8 dollars for a hotdog? I believe that serving high quality food for a fair price is something that has seemed to have gotten lost. You can serve food for these prices on the Las Vegas Strip because it's a tourist destination and you can get away with it. Off the strip that stuff doesn't fly, at least not with me. I think this business needs to rethink the cost of their menu. That is probably a good reason why only two tables were occupied for dinner. 

For all these reasons Dirt Dog gets 3 stars. Three very generous, wife influenced 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is frikkin yummy!!! Even tho mine was too spicy to eat the flavor was heaven sent! We each got a different dog, had to order the street corn in a cup, the fries, the whole works!! Will definitely be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"I am definitely not a hot dog person but if I'm ever craving a hot dog I come here!!! Good food and a chill atmosphere. You should also try the dirty corn. Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs and fries are delicious and I'm basing the stars on just the food.

I tried the House Dog and the Green Dog. The House was my favorite out of the two. Someone mentioned a secret menu, but I forgot to ask about it when I was there. Does anyone know what's on the secret menu?

The music matches the name of the food - dirty. I'm a fan of 90's rap and hip-hop, but even with the filter on, it's too extreme and loud for my taste. So be aware if you're thinking of bringing kids with you."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are bomb! & the staff is super friendly which makes the experience even better, they even gave us free chili fries!!! But definitely try the elote fries, you won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to be very Frank, my Dirt Dog wasn't juicy & fresh. It would appear that the Dog was old and sat there, then covered up with all the condiments, which looked like a big mess. 

Service was normal, but the numerous & endless restaurant row of small businesses makes me feel they don't have enough customers to be offering Fresh food all the time.

Do your belly a favor, skip the Dog because Dirt Dog lives up to the name ;)

Ciao"}
{"text":"Owner was super friendly and the dogs and garlic fries were really good. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I don't always want hot dogs but when I'm craving one or I want some really good elotes I come here! The staff is quite friendly and it doesn't take too long to get your order. 

It's set up is easy: you walk in, the menu on the right and you walk up and order your meal. Take a seat anywhere and just relax. 

It's always a good experience here, I always love ordering a full meal as in a hot dog, fries, elote, a dessert and a drink. It's not terribly priced you get what you pay for.

The only thing I would caution about is the garlic fries are deadly and they aren't so unique. Just tons of minced and juiced garlic with fries, it's nothing special I wouldn't order it again. 

Order your hot dog on a lobster roll you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Who thought a hot dog could taste this good? I had the elote dog and my daughter enjoyed the patty melt dog. Both were absolutely delicious! We even enjoyed some of their filthy fries and were pleasantly surprised. We even ordered the elote in the cup. They arrived a little cold but still good none the less. We finished it all off with some Mexican cokes. We will Definitely return to try the many other offerings they have. Yumm!"}
{"text":"My husband,friend and I decided to come try these guys after a video was shared with us about their corn. We absolutely love elote and couldn't pass this up. Plus hotdogs and tacos? Score! We ordered dirty esquite, 4 carne asada tacos, 3 pastor tacos, 1 elote dog, 1 filthy fry, and a dirty elote and some drinks. My first issue was that the dirty elote (pretty much a traditional elote style corn) and one of the carne asada tacos never came. When we finally checked the receipt we realized the cashier hadn't charged us so my husband went back to order it and see how long it was going to be, he decided it wasn't worth the wait as he'd already finished his hot dog (not a huge deal since we weren't charged but my husband was bummed). The elote dog was pretty bland. I didn't really taste the corn over the beef flavor of the dog. The dirty esquite felt like they had just added a bunch of cotjia to a cup of corn and it was kind of dry. The tacos also didn't pack much flavor. They came with a wedge of lime and some red salsa that was kind of an average salsa. Now I will say the filthy fries were pretty good. They had guacamole, chipotle aioli, cotija, and some melted cheese. I really enjoyed the chipotle aioli and think they could've added that to the elote dog for a kick. The fries were all our favorites and agreed we'd eat them again but that the rest of the food wasn't worth the drive from centennial out to blue diamond. It wasn't a total bust for a one time trip. Overall we just felt a little rushed ordering and the cashier not hearing parts of the order was disappointing. The order also wasn't read back to us so we didn't realize the mistake. The tables had order numbers left and we couldn't tel which tables were taken and had trash left behind as well so we had to clean off a table for ourselves. I'd say try them but it didn't live up to the hype and the videos people shared with us."}
{"text":"OMG... This Place is AWESOME. I have had almost all the dogs except the veggie dog. My personal fav is the Mut dog which is NOT on the menue. I usually get that w the Dirty Chips which are also AMAZING. The staff is always helpful, the atmosphere is cool it reminds me of being back home in Cali."}
{"text":"Best freaking dogs I've ever had. Seriously people. I'm a NYC transplant And I have never had hotdogs at this. Their fries are the bomb. Food is so good I don't even mind the hall and crazy for Los Angeles crap."}
{"text":"Okay, so, we're from LA and a certain man I know *cough* was kinda obsessed with DogHaus, if you're familiar. So, I found this place which is very similar and also serves VEGGIE DOGS!!!!!!! HAPPY VEGETARIAN DANCE!!!!! See, everybody's happy. So, we walk in and there's only one person ahead of us. Points for fast service! 

Everything is reasonably priced. We ordered two hot dogs, a kids meal, a side of fries, and two drinks for $30. The fries are seasoned with some sort of witchcraft-y blend that is the perfect amount of salty and spice. Amazing. My fiancé got the chili dog with a beef hot dog and said it was nothing short of spectacular. Apparently the lobster bun is also worth noting...... like 8 times. I ordered the \"brown dog\" with a veggie dog which was essentially a teriyaki stir fry on top of a veggie dog in a buttery soft bun! LORD IN HEAVEN. I cannot. The carbs. But so good. So, so good. We got the kids corn dogs for our 4 year old son and he  also gobbled that shit up. 

Okay, suffice to say that the food is friggen awesome. The cashier was also super friendly and the service was fast! I have no complaints, only happy-warm-fuzzy \"I'm not even gonna eat dinner tonight because lunch was so good\" feelings. That is all."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. First, they play 2Pac on loop, second, they have Spacedust IPA on tap, third the food is filling and delicious, fourth, the people/customer service is phenomenal. You get the inviting feeling that you can hangout there even well after you have eaten (the board games they loan out are part of that inviting feeling) Very chill, very clean and very intimate setting. Love this place."}
{"text":"This hot dog place was grrrrrreat! I had the elote dog & my husband had the house dog. We also got garlic, regular fries, & jamaica. The food had great wholesome flavor & the staff had such a genuine friendly awesome attitude. They play old hip hop music, serve beers on tap & you can watch sports. Simple concept with great execution!"}
{"text":"It's 10 at night, and what do I crave? Elote. 
I'm in the Summerlin area - looking for something that's still open and has people raving. In comes Dirt Dog , a place my bro in law visited while he was down in LA. The reviews are superb, so why the hell not? 

My fiancé and I arrive to find a few people inside, rap/hip-hop music playing in the background and a smiling person up front to take our order. 

We order the elote (with light cotija cheese) & the filthy fries. We attempted to order the horchata dessert (which looked damn delicious) but the clerk informed us that the churros weren't coming out right so they weren't going to sell those (which i appreciate cause I'm not trying to eat a wonky looking churro LOL). 

When our order arrived, my fiancé noticed that there were bacon bits on the filthy fries (even though that's not listed as an ingredient on the menu). There were also bacon bits on my elote which I hadn't noticed so I appreciate the lady who came running out to tell me after she found out we don't eat bacon. I'm happy that they were willing to make our order again - that too without any hesitation! :) 

As for the food, I think it was a little cold but that's probably because we took it to go instead of eating it in. 
I'll be back earlier next time to dine in though! 

Customer Service = FIVE. 
I'm docking a star because I think that something like bacon should be stated as an ingredient on the menu. 

...but that won't stop me from coming next time!"}
{"text":"Great place for some stoner grub. LA based food truck goodies. Pretty cool atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST try place !!! Everything tastes so amazing!!! Got the elote hotdog and chilli cheese fries. I'm definitely going to come back for those tacos !"}
{"text":"Usually not a fan of hot dogs but the chili cheese fries hot dog was delicious! The elote was also a guilty pleasure. Love the ambiance of this place, which is chill yet modern. I highly recommend this place when people are visiting or for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Dogs were Ono. Had the patty melt dog, dirty chili dog, esquite, Filty fries and carne asada fries. We are so stuffed. Mahalo"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best hot dog joint I've ever been too. I've never tasted anything like it! Literally felt like I was in LA as I was eating my dirty dog. It was definitely worth the 35 minute drive. I probably will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in around four. The middle of the evening. I don't know about him but I was expecting a few people to be in there. Little did I know that when we did walk in, the place was completely empty. The only physical person we saw was one guy in the back in the kitchen area. I noticed that guy did glance at us but he didn't greet us until my boyfriend waved his hands in the air. We stood in the front scoping the menu for about ten minutes until a lady walked out from the back and told us \"She would be right with us.\" We we're in no rush so we didn't mind. It felt like another five minutes flew by until our order we finally taken. We were just questioning why it took so long to order and wondered if they just opened cause it looked like they were still preparing for the day. 

When it came to the food, I got the Dirty Chili Dog. Right when it got served to me, I was very excited. The sauce was dripping down the bun and it overall looked stuffed. First bite, was outstanding! I got a taste of the flavors including the bacon bits. It was not until the middle of the dog that I realized that the bottom half of my bun was sort of hard. The only reason I didn't catch it right away was because the dog itself was covered in sauce. Other than that, my hot dog was pretty good. Not bad at all. 

My boyfriend tried the tacos! $2 dollars a taco, he begs to differ. Out of the three tacos, he realized one of his tacos were cold. But the rest were like warm. Those were his only complaints about the tacos but overall they were pretty decent. 

Would we come back to this place? Sure, if we were in the area and it was one of our last resort. This place was not bad at all."}
{"text":"Had the deep fried twinkies and elote. Both were so delicious! Will be back when I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, creative dishes to pick from. However seating is pretty terrible and the place is quite small. Their staff is on point though! They're really busy because they have some great food! Would love to see them open up a location in Henderson"}
{"text":"This place is goooooood! Only thing is, it's a little pricey. Other than that, the flavor is there. I got the Elote Dog & my boyfriend got the House Dog. Both were good! The Horchata was a little TOO sweet for my liking but I simply just added water and it fixed the problem ;) 
Also, since I got the elote Dog, I got the loose elote in a cup so for every bite of the hot dog, I added more of that elote corn. 
Check it out! They have cool inside and they play good music :D the cashier was really nice too. If you wanna gage on how much it would be.. for me and my boyfriend, we spent around $35"}
{"text":"This place has always been on my to go places and I finally got the chance to try. It was pretty good. 

Each hot dog is apparently wrapped in bacon which makes it even better. You have a choice of buns you can put your hot dog on..from lobster roll (which is $0.50) more or Portuguese roll or regularbhot dog bun. 

I ordered the red dogg. Which has chile sauce, peppers and chipotle aioli. It was pretty good. The peppers definitely gave it a good kick of spice. The toppings weren't overwhelming with alot of stuff so you can actually taste the juiciness of the hot dog. Yumm. 
My friend ordered the mutt dog which is a mix between the red dogg and green dogg. He said it was pretty good. 

I also ordered the filthy fries. Wasn't a huge fan of this one. It has cotija cheese, guacamole, cheese spread and fries. It didn't taste as great as it sounded. Next time I'll stick with regular fries. 

Overall it's a good place to try. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Now this is what we were expecting! This visit was amazing! We ordered an elotes dog (me), pattymelt dog (hubby), filthy fries, dirty corn and 2 beers. Our dogs were great! Full of flavor and we will definitely order them again! The filthy fries made us look at each other, like oooh these are good. My husband stuck with his usual and ordered a Modelo. I ordered the Space Dust double IPA and ooooh it was so good! 

We decided to get dessert.. horchata ice cream and churro.. this was amazing! We weren't able to finish it since we were so full!

Tiffany (manager) asked how everything was.. we told her we will definitely be back and will bring the kids next time!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of hotdogs... at all. Dirt dog may have converted me though. Located in the same plaza as Annie pho, I think, and that pet resort. It's very tucked in this plaza & you'll probably miss it if you're not paying attention. 

Anyway, I've been here a couple of times & I've ordered the same thing lol. They apparently have a secret menu & obviously it's not written anywhere in the establishment. I usually order the mutt dog & I believe that's a mixture of the green & red dog, but I'm not completely sure. The flavor is amazingggg though. It has a little kick. Throw it in a lobster bun & order some dirty fries & im pretty sure that's what heaven tastes like. I was really excited about having elotes near my house, but unfortunately I didn't like theirs. When I got mine, it was burnt... & I waited over 15 mins for it. I guess I'll have to keep making them at home for now."}
{"text":"My family and I have been back to Dirt Dog 3 times since it opened and I wrote my original review. Each time the service has been friendly and fast, and the food doesn't disappoint. We've tried about half of the things on their menu so far but I keep coming back to a Green Dog on a lobster roll with sweet potato fries as my favorite. But we'll keep going back and trying other things to see if we can find more stuff that we like. 

Parking: Ugh. If it's busy trying to find a place to park can be a pain. Getting back out on Rainbow if you want to go South is also a pain. But the friendly food and great service makes it worth the hassle. 4 Stars and no other complaints."}
{"text":"I've never taken this many hot dogs to the mouth before, but I'm very satisfied! Xoxo EatWithReese"}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed! Walked in at a little after 10 pm the place is open until 11 and we still received to notch service and food.
Located in a small strip center this place is unassuming from the front.  Easy to read menu boards and friendly staff.  Hubby and I ordered two dogs and a churro.... Finished them and had to order one more dog to share.
The hot dogs are juicy and bacon wrapped and a very decent size dog.  The toppings were just enough that they had little falling of but enough that you got toppings in each bite.  You get to choose your bun, they come with a few set toppings (customizable..ex: no green bell pepper) and then extras that make each dog unique.
Definitely worth checking this place out. They play good music too!"}
{"text":"For the food and atmosphere this place is special. Shout out to Cali and the L.A. hip hop/ rap scene. While hits from Ice Cube and Tupac are playing, you get to try to figure out what you want to pick out with their large digital menu. Getting the Dirty Chili Dog to go today. The lines do get long and parking can be tricky. The restaurant is tucked in the way back corner of a strip mall where a pet hospital and a big bar/lounge is, so I recommend just parking a little farther and just walking the rest of the way. Customer service is really nice and the murals of Tupac and Kobe Bryant adds to the atmosphere. They offer style tacos and a vegan taco too. The corn on the cob is Mexican street style with chili powder, slice of lime, and cotija cheese on top. Yum yum. They also serve some craft beers, horchata, and Jamaica drink. However, sometime they run out of things. Maybe because they are so busy? Like today they said they ran out if CO2 for their soda machine. Boo. And they ran out of horchata today. Either way, the place is still cool and the food is good. I'm sure they will work out some of these supply issues as they see how more popular they are getting. Come and get your Tupac and hot dog fix here!"}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd time to redeem my previous visit. Last time was on Good Friday so I ordered a vegetarian meal. That was a mistake! 
This time, I had the elote dog and an order of cheese fries. I left so stuffed! The elote dog was delicious. The Frank was juicy and the combination of hot dog and street corn worked great together. I needed like 10 napkins. I could not finish all my fries and they were so good, plus I ordered them with cheese sauce. The service was great, music was bumpin' and I'll definitely be back after a couple days on the treadmill. Great spot for a quick lunch or if it's time for you to indulge."}
{"text":"Those elote fries- I'm still shook to my core. The hotdogs are arguably the best I've ever had. Just wow."}
{"text":"Loooooove Dirt Dog! I'm from Cali, so the Cali vibe in here is awesome. The food is super good too. My boyfriend and I have been here a bunch of times now and we always try to get something different. Literally haven't found anything I don't like. My personal favorite is the green dog and the elote.... and the fried Oreos lol."}
{"text":"The dogs could have been a little bigger but couldn't have been better. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best hot dog I've ever had. I had he ranchero dog and the garlic fries. Fried Oreos were to die for! The environment was chill playing the old r&b hip hop (2pac era/influenced) I will definitely come again and again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is not for the weak of heart... that can really have two meanings lol.  Be prepared to get dirty.  The name doesn't lie. This place is full of messy deliciousness.  

I say this often, but being from NY I'm a food-snob about certain foods and hot dogs are definitely one of those items.  This place is legit!

I got the House Dog, the Red Dog and the Dirty Fries.  

Both hot dogs were flavor explosions.  First off, one hot dog is a enough.  I ordered two because it was my cheat day and I couldn't decide, so I ate half of each.  

The house dog with the bacon thousand island? Are you kidding me? Bacon Thousand Island? Then... more bacon? Soooooo good!

The Red dog just had such great flavor... smokey from the chipotle and some kick from the chili sauce...oh yeah, more bacon!  Can't pick a favorite here.  The only true winner was me since I got to try both.  The fries were solid, but I couldn't make my way through all of them.  

They also have an impressive little beer list with a couple of nice craft beers.  This place is about twenty minutes from me, but it's worth the drive for another cheat day."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite hotdog spot it a good drive out .....the waitress was nice and always made sure if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Great food, great look, and great service! Their red dog is my favorite and their twist on Mexican elote (corn) is mouthwatering! Hard to believe that one can get so full on a hotdog but, these are no ordinary hot dogs! I have been there a couple of times and will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"So the hot dogs are to die for and the elote is amazing. It's a fun environment with great music"}
{"text":"While in the area I stopped by to grab some food to go and it did not disappoint. Ordered The Mutt (combined Red and Green dogs) at the recommendation of a employee and it was solid. Also got a order of the Dirty Esquite...which I can never pass up in any situation, verrry good. All in all I can't help but recommend this place for a solid grub down and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"It's not exactly street food, it's as if street food went a bit high class but it was still great, I had the elote corn and it was ok nothing fantastic but good...I would buy it again. Also ordered an elote dog which was great the dog was a big tasty hot dog that did not get lost in the mix of toppings and the bun was tasty with out feeling like all you tasty was bread. The best hot dog I've ordered anywhere. My wife ordered the carne asada fries and they were ok, to me the asada tasted like chipped beef but my wife is super picky and she liked them. They also had Coke from Mexico, which I love. It's a bit expensive but to me as an every once in a while place it's worth it. Even if you don't like hot dogs you should try this place cause it might change you mind about them. To me the best hot dog place in the whole Vegas area."}
{"text":"I happened to find out about this place through an Instagram page that features local Vegas dining. My husband is a big fan of Dog Haus so as soon as I saw this place I knew we just had to try it! 
     Although small and quaint the atmosphere was very chill and relaxed. Menu was posted on the wall to the right as you come in the door so no confusion or fuss as to what to choose. Also the staff is very nice and helpful with answering any questions you may have.I had their House Dog which was excellent and my husband had the Green Dog with a substituted soy dog in place of the beef. Between the two of us we shared the dirty fries.
     I love the fact that the menu is short, simple, and to the point. I can't wait to go back and try it again. Especially that dirty corn and horchata ice cream!

*I gave this place only 4 stars  because it is not very kid friendly. My husband and I had our daughter with us who is just a toddler. I asked if there was any way to just purchase half a hot dog with no toppings. The man working the front informed me that I would be charged full price *$5.95 and that a kids menu was in the works. That's fine and all but full price for a half hot dog for a toddler? That's a bit much in my opinion but we made do and just shared what we ordered with our daughter. Also there is no changing table in the women's bathroom, I'm going to guess that there will be parents bringing their toddlers and babies in sometime that may need to be changed. So it's a good idea to have one installed in both the women AND men's bathrooms. They at least had high chairs, so good job on that! Other than that excellent service, food, and overall experience."}
{"text":"I've passed this place while at work and finally made it in. I ordered the patty melt dog and an 805 beer. Total came to around $14. When you walk in, the menu is up on the wall. It is a little overwhelming but the cashier was very helpful. I'd recommend going before rush hour or after for your first time because it does get busy and you don't want to hold up the line with questions. 

They have a fairly small menu but it all looks good. They even have a veggie dog for those of you that don't eat meat. 

Received my food really quickly! It was hot and delicious and went wonderfully with the beer. I'd go back to try other dogs and maybe even some of the desserts."}
{"text":"This place was bommmmb! I love hot dogs and there are not a lot around. Food was great and the coworkers were awesome. I wish I got the girl that worked the counter when I came in Saturday night. She was very helpful and patient as I was deciding which hot dog to get. They have beer too!!! She gave me some samples before choosing the one I wanted. Def coming here more often!!! Very clean as well :)!!!"}
{"text":"Had a couple different things here pretty good can't complain but a little surprised they don't have just a traditional Sonoran dog."}
{"text":"I first noticed that the parking lot was completely full. That's a very good sign. There is still plenty of parking nearby at the other businesses in the shopping center. 

There was a long line went we walked in. The line moved relatively fast. I loved the giant menus on the walls. We knew what we wanted to order when it was our turn at the register. 

I loved how they called my son's kids meal order to the chefs immediately....before I even gave my order. Smart! They understand the importance of getting kids food fast. Hungry kids tend not to be happy kids. I ordered a dog and grilled corn on the cob. 

My son's meal come first. He loved everything. My corn on the cob came next. I kind of liked how they didn't wait to bring out the dog and the corn together. I can only eat one at a time anyway. And this way the dog wasn't cold when I was ready to dig into it. 

I was thrown at the register when paying. It asks how much you want to tip. This was my first visit so I wasn't familiar with how the place was run. I tipped lower than usual as a result. Next time I'll be sure to tip much higher. The team does an amazing job constantly turning over tables, they serve the food fast and everyone has a great attitude. Everyone works hard, fast and happy. 

We will definitely be back. That corn on the cob was amazing! The dog was good too."}
{"text":"kept seeing it advertised on social media.. finally checked it out.  #muttdog was on point!!  I'll be back soon.."}
{"text":"Their fries are great! And the dogs there are better, and after you finish you're meal, they have awesome deep fried Twinkies and deep fried Oreos"}
{"text":"Food was alright. I wasn't overly impressed but it wasn't bad. The chips are really good and the lobster bun was really good!"}
{"text":"What is with all the hype here? My group waited about 20 minutes to order which is understandable considering the place was packed to the brim and too many people were hanging out on their phones taking up (dirty, unbussed) tables after their parties were finished eating. I think we may have came on a day that the restaurant had some promotion on FB or something. The food was just okay overall... the redeeming bites I had were of the horchata ice cream! I would only come back if my friends were already planning on going there, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"The space is small and can get packed quickly. Be ready to stand in line to order food. It is worth it. I was not impressed with the tacos but the elote dog and elote fries were great."}
{"text":"I kept seeing pictures of the food here on social media & it literally made my mouth water. This place is about a 30-35 minute drive across town for me & thankfully I can say it was completely worth it. 

First off, the restaurant has such a cool vibe to it. The decor is nice, the staff is great & I loved the music; old school hip hop & some other music genres mixed in. Very open seating, so you don't feel cramped at all. 

Now onto the food...Oh. My. Goodness! Everything we ate was amazing. We got 4 different dogs. The spicy one being my favorite but all delicious. The fries were crisp & cooked/flavored perfectly. Dessert did not disappoint at all! I loved the horchata ice cream & the portion size was perfect for my boyfriend & I to share. The homemade churros were soooo much better than your standard churro & it came with a great cream to dip it in that complimented the flavor well. Deep fried Oreos were awesome. 

I will 100% be back again & the one thing I loved was that I didn't feel gross after all that food. Usually with hot dogs & sweets you feel heavy, bloated, greasy, etc & I felt great. I think that speaks to the quality of the food & the way it's cooked. Everyone must try this place!"}
{"text":"I'm actually sad to say everything was great. I was secretly hoping to not like anything about this place as its been a conscious decision of mine to stay away from hot dogs for over a year now. Decent beer selections. Took the cashiers recommendation on the Dog to get and it was super tasty. Will most likely be holding a cheat meal here from time to time."}
{"text":"This place rocks... Since I am an LA County girl, the decor makes me homesick.  The women's bathroom is even painted with Santa Monica.  

Right when you walk in to the place a very nice girl greets you and asks if you have been there before. We told her no, so she gave us the run down of all the need to know's!  

We tried a little bit of everything. Everything was really, really good! We didn't dine in because we were on the go, but we appreciate the way they packaged everything so well, including the corn on the stick.  

I had the house dog and loved it. They are large, but still wish I would have ordered two even though I know, I would have been dying stuffed. 

The chicken taco I ordered was on the smaller side, but I mostly came for the hot dog.  I regret not ordering the elote fries; next time. 

Great atmosphere, great food, friendly service.  If you are from LA, or love LA, this is the place for you!  Even if you don't; hey the food is good."}
{"text":"I had already ate 30 minutes prior but I could not resist. So in between a few meetings I had I stopped in. First off Too Short/E40 playing overhead. That's a plus. 2nd the people that work there are extremely nice and upbeat. The last part was the food was great I had the corn and mutt dog. With a churro added. All 3 tasted great plenty of flavor. I can't wait to try the ice cream next time."}
{"text":"The food, is amazing. Easily the best hotdog I've had so far in my pursuit of \"gourmet\" dogs. 

the staff, very small staff it seems but the few we did see & interact with were extremely friendly. 

the cleanliness, the ambiance, the price...everything in this place is great. 
Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, music, staff, price and of course food! Definitely a spot to hang out with friends or family. Also has free board game for free!"}
{"text":"love, love, love.... my daughter enjoyed it and she's hard to please me and my husband had nothing to complain about and the staff were amazing. I'm exited!!!"}
{"text":"10/10!!! These are the most unique hot dogs I've ever tried. They are nostalgic and remind of LA food trucks (not to mention Dirt Dog is based in LA). Also the parmesan fries are so delicious. I cannot wait to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.
The girl at the register and the girl that brought our food could teach people about how to treat customers.
They were awesome.really nice and friendly and attentive.
The music playlist was legit.
The food was awesome as well."}
{"text":"The best hotdog you've ever had - period. Located off of south rainbow and next to a pho place, lets just say I eat a lot less pho and a lot more dirtdogs.

This place is about the dog, but more than that, they're about the toppings and the bun.

TIPS:

1. Be prepared to wait a bit. Not because the place is ever slammed with customers, but because the quality of food they provide just takes a bit to finish.
2. GET THE LOBSTER ROLL. I personally think this should be the only bread option they offer because it's so much better than a regular bun.
3. Chips/Fries - these are just OK in my opinion, however, if you like seasoned fries/chips, they may be up your alley.
4. One hotdog is enough, unless you're a really big, super starving dude. I'd recommended bringing a friend, ordering two different dogs and splitting them. It's amazing how different they taste.

Favorite item - the green dog."}
{"text":"Best hot dog in town! Had the house special on the lobster roll, their dirty corn, and fried oreos. They also played great hip hop as well"}
{"text":"Nice that this place is right down the road!! The food here is amazing! We came in one day and ordered and have been back multiple times!!! The prices are affordable and would recommend to anyone looking to try something new. 

The lobster bun is a must!! I wouldn't have it any other way! Also you must have the deep fried oreos! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Awesome doesn't say enough about this place! I got an order to go, however, next time I won't wait until I get home , because home was 45 minutes away. I went at a great time no wait and for those vegetarian lovers they have vegetarian dogs and vegan tacos! I got a dirt Dog on a Lobster roll! I thought I must be in heaven! I'm thinking it was probably one of the best things I've ever eaten! You must try it! I will be there again!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go on a Friday night and I only came here because I wanted some corn. L0L. I ended up ordering the dirty corn, elote dog, & a churro. I was really tempted to order the fried oreos but I decided to save it for another day. The elote dog was good, but I was disappointed in the dirty corn, it looked like it would be bursting with flavor but instead it was bland. Maybe I just got a dud one, oh well I'll try again next time. The churro was decent, it just doesn't compare to Disney Land's churros, BUT the whip cream it came with was delicious."}
{"text":"I think this is the best hot dog place I have gone to. I got an elote dog on butter bread and an esquite!  VERY GOOD! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had wanting to check this place out after seeing it on Instagram. It wasn't that busy when we went in because it was in between lunch and dinner. The service was good and everyone was attentive and made sure we were satisfied. 

I decided to order the Green Dog and the Mexican corn in a dish as a side. You are able to pick the bun you want with your hot dog so I picked the Lobster bun based off the recommendation of the server. The roll has nothing to do with lobster so if you aren't a sea food fan do not let this scare you away. I was glad I did because it was really soft and buttery.

The hot dog itself was pretty good. The only recommendation I can give is to grill hotdogs. They taste so much better when they are grilled and I think it would really enhance the flavor. I also wished they put the guacamole on the top of the dog instead of in the roll because it was hard to taste that way.

The corn was good as well but I wish there was a little less cheese because it overpowered the corn. 

Overall it was ok, just wish they were able to grill the hot dogs."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm I don't even like hot dogs but this place makes me love them and that cornnnn can you say mmm mmm good?! Only disappointment is the long wait but can you blame them? You know it's good when there's nowhere to be seated."}
{"text":"There was a line about 15 people deep when we came in but knew it was worth the wait.  The decor of the place was super cool. They have a huge map of Vegas on the wall so you can put where you in the valley you came from to eat here. Austin was super friendly and helpful with any questions we had. The tables were cleaned super fast after people left which was nice. We got the brown dog, the party melt dog and the house dog with a side of dirty fries. Overall it was pretty good. I would recommend this place for anyone. They also had street tacos and vegan and vegetarian options which I though was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very clean, great music, great customer service & awesome food! What more could you ask for. Don't forget to try their dessert menu. We will definitely be back , hopefully to enjoy our meal with a beer. Just our luck their CO2 tank was out"}
{"text":"What a great change of pace from the typical Asian fusion restaurant or Italian cucina! This an LA based hot dog shack that has a flair for Mexican street food, serving a unique array of bacon-covered hot dogs ranging from $7-8. They also specialize in elotes, loaded fries($3-5), street tacos ($2), and indulgent desserts like deep fried Oreos and Twinkies with horchata whipped cream! My friend got the al pastor fries and I got the elote dog both of which were SO GOOD. Service was very friendly, giving us great recommendations and they even gave me options for the type of bun which was cool. Although it was super messy to eat, the flavor was the absolute best!! I can't wait to come back to this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"It's good for a craft beer and a quality hot dog with some extra thought put into its toppings. Veggie option available as well. Deep fried Oreos! Only other place I've seen those is at a fair."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are really good and so is the service!
The only negative thing I can say is that we didn't get all our food at once, the place got a little busy and they only had two people working.
Other than that I would recommend this place no doubt."}
{"text":"Best dogs in the city - hands down! The hubby wanted a hot dog while we were shopping at Target. I remembered seeing some friends check in here so I convinced him to come and check it out. The guy at the register was super friendly and walked us through the menu. I ordered the red dog and my husband got the green dog with a side of corn for my daughter. We decided to cut up both dogs when they arrived so we could both try each. We were blown away by the overall flavors and freshness of the dogs. I loved the red, definitely had a kick to it but the green was equally tasty in its own way. My daughter was a fan of the corn as well. We enjoyed the dogs so much that we decide we had to split the house dog and put in a second order in one sitting. It was delish but I still enjoyed the red the best. Highly recommend Dirt Dog for the food, ambience and awesome service."}
{"text":"Great spot to have a hotdog and beer on a nice Sunday chill afternoon.It was close to our neighborhood so that's an extreme plus. You order as soon as you walk in..there was a line because they only have one register working, and you basically just sit yourself anywhere. The place was clean and the menu is creative and interesting not your typical hotdog stand lol. Food was delicious and will definitely frequent this place specially during footballl season..they have big TV's yay!"}
{"text":"#SecretMenu

Stopped in to this super hip little joint this morning for some lunch today. I absolutely love the ambiance it's very hip and the music was pretty dope. I ordered Elote Fries from the \"secret menu\" via YELP and they were so good with a hint of lime. The Churro with Horchata was pretty tasty as well! I loved the chopped up almonds as well! 

$15 bucks later including a water I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff here is awesome. My husband and I came here because I saw a foodie post about it on ig. The pictures do it no justice. The secret menu is real but you really don't need to order from it because the things on the menu are so bomb. The Portuguese bread is high quality. Way better than pinks hot dogs...incomparable!! Good San Diego beer on draft. Will def come back. The manager from LA and the guy from LA/SD are super personable and added to our experience here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and I have tried a goood majority of the menu and haven't found one thing that I didn't like. I have taken friends and my mom and they all love it! Thank you for the great service and great food! You have a loyal customer in me and my friends"}
{"text":"Came here around 10pm on a Saturday night. The person at the counter was very helpful and went over the menu options. Let her know we are vegetarians looking at the veggie dog options. We ended up ordering the Mutt Dog (red and green veggie dog), the cup of elite, dirty fries, vegan taco  and fried Oreos. So good! They even offered us free stouts. I think they were trying to get rid of the last bit of the beer stouts they had but one of them had a nice cinnamon flavor. I love the cool map on the wall along with all of the artwork! Will definitely come back. Great service! It looked like teenagers kept coming in even around 10:59pm (1 minute before closing). I personally would hate it if someone came into my workplace a minute before closing but they seen really accommodating and still served."}
{"text":"5 stars is simply not enough to rate this place. Dirt Dog is absolutely fantastic. Definitely worth the drive across town and well worth the money spent. Whenever I come home to visit Dirt Dog will forever be my go to place as soon as I hop off the plane."}
{"text":"Dogs are ok. They look huge in the pictures but are pretty small. $30 bucks for two cokes, two dogs and one corn.  Very overpriced for what you get and food was very bland."}
{"text":"Love this place. I became a vegetarian 5 months ago. I looked up their menu and they have a vegetarian hotdog!!!!! I was so excited! I went there for my birthday dinner and it was amazing!!!! Highly recommended this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this one to open and was NOT disappointing.  I had the green dog, the all-beef dog is a great change from typical low quality dogs, the bacon is there, but not a thick overwhelming cut that some may worry about.  Staff was great, eager for feedback because they really want to get it right.  I was there a day before beer was served so excited to get back there and have a cold one and try the next dog."}
{"text":"I love hot dogs and this place just blew me out of the water! I had the regular house dog and the Mexican corn and, my goodness, whoever created them is a genius. 

Note: the dogs are so loaded that pieces will fall off so be sure to eat over the little plate and not over your clothes!

The decor is fun and the people were very friendly."}
{"text":"First time ate yesterday at dirt dog had the Patty melt dog on a lobster roll it was great also had deep fried Oreos mmm food and service was great I highly recommend this place...I will be definitely going back and I want to try all there different style of dirt dogs.."}
{"text":"Came here on the way home from Vegas just for the street corn and was not disappointed. Definitely will come back the next time I am in the vegas area. Also got the green veggie dog and it was tasty."}
{"text":"Dirt Dogs is pretty tasty! The Mexican Corn was delish! I had the Green Dog on a Lobster Roll and my Daughter had the Chili Dog. She said it was a bit too spicy but she liked it. The Garlic Fries were good but not heat hot, so need to make sure the food is heat hot, please and thank you:) definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered two Red Dogs, Dirty Fries and Seasalt and Pepper fries . Paid extra for the Lobster bun , definitely worth it  . Pretty good overall . The Dirty fries didnt have the Limon kick I was expecting tho . Wish they had more options on the menu .

Nice atmosphere and set up . Mostly heard hiphop while I was eating , then it switched to some James Brown and Frankie Lymon . I like ! Was pretty dead when we came in but the table we went to had crumbs all over it . Besides that , pretty clean ."}
{"text":"So good  I love the atmosphere is fun to sit down with a family  and my hot dog was wonderful  If you are in Las Vegas you gotta stop here"}
{"text":"Food was ok. It is after all just hot dogs. Service was too lax and as if we were a burden. Menu is small but prices are extremely expensive for what you're getting. I most likely won't be back since hot dogs are cheap and I rather spend my money on food I'm not easily cooking at home."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good unique hot dog especially when everything comes with bacon! I took my parents here when they came for a visit. I got the house dog, mom got the patty melt, and dad got the dirty chili dog. We also got the chili cheese fries. All the hot dogs were really tasty and good quality meat. The fries were awesome. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The customer service was amazing! So friendly. The food was awesome! Red dog is spicy, and the green dog had so much flavor. Dirty Corn was very authentic. Garlic Fries were to die for! Not disappointed at all. They were out of a few things, but I could see why. I will recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Omg.  I had the secret menu \"Mutt dog(?)\" (combo of the red dog and green dog) and it was amazing!  I was definitely spicy hot but the heat dissipated quickly and the flavor was awesome.  I also had the dirty fries and loved them.  I'm pretty sure there are a lot of Dirt Dawg hot dogs in my future."}
{"text":"Love it ! Like love it.. the house dog is delicious, the horchata fried ice cream is amazing, need to be more happy and smile more often the girls in the front specially a essence of urgency since is always super busy, but other than that they cool !"}
{"text":"I've seen this place on Facebook decided to try it  I'm from alaiante area so it was pretty far for us but when we came we soon found out it was way worth the drive. the atmosphere is very great. they have card games why you wait for your food. I had the Patty melt dog and my wife had the elote dog very amazing every bite was like a piece of heaven . I had the fried Twinkie for desert better than carnival forsure. I will be coming here way more often now.  until I conquer the whole menu."}
{"text":"Really good food! A lot of options to choose from with fries and hot dogs. The service is really good and friendly. Very busy but the food comes out pretty quick. The atmosphere is great. Definitely 1 of the top 5 hot dog restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"It ain't a dog unless its a Dirt Dog! I've been to both, the one in Las Vegas and in LA near USC. Both were the same and the dogs were excellent! I don't eat here without the corn. I'm not a fan of the deep fried oreos but the deep fried twinkies are incredible. It's like a churros breaded twinkie of awesomeness! Don't do dogs unless its DIRT!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing dogs, great sides, fried desserts! Only negative is the lack of seating for dinner hour. Will be going back many times, and will bring friends! Lots of beer on tap, loved both the patty melt and house dog, kids food tastes great too. Line was out the door, for good reason. Worth the drive, worth the wait, worth your money and time guys."}
{"text":"Yummy vegan selections... With lots of options! I think my favorite though more so than the dog surprisingly, were the vegan fries that had chorizo guac and cheese all over them... Yum we will definitely be back. Also a plus plus plus on staff employees were extremely helpful happy positive awesome to our kids... Great experience definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"So finally decided to try this joint and it didn't live up to my expectation. I mean every one has their own taste but as far as for mine, it was just an okay. 

Me and wifey tried the green dog and the brown dog with both lobster bread. The hot dog and the mix that goes along with it are okay, the bread was very good though. Its a one time quitter for me. I like the hotdogs with bacon wrapped around them at fahion district in L.A. again my personal preference.

Staff was friendly and place was pretty neat."}
{"text":"Everybody needs to try this place :) The food is really good. The people who work here are super nice. There was a huge line when we arrived but the line went so fast!"}
{"text":"I was actually really excited to try this place but their simple menu may have been too simple. (I like simple menus when the simple you do offer hits a home run everytime!) The corn tasted like kerosene. I thought I would be eating the corn similar to the LA (Santee alley) mexi corn but nope! Tried a simple bacon wrapped hot dog, it was just ok. Garlic fries was supposed to be well done but came out not crispy at all. Spent about $35 on my family but wished I didn't. The place possibly has some potential but definitely  lacking in the wow factor."}
{"text":"Whenever you have a craving for fastfood, do yourself a favor by coming here! The quality of their food is so much better than what you'd get from a regular fast food joint. 

The variety of hotdogs is quite surprising. I decided to go with the \"traditional\"  dirt dog and was blown away that I was eating a \"hotdog\"

Interior is nicely designed and the service was very nice and friendly. A must try"}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday with my sister.  We went around 9:35 and they close at 10.  It was my first time and I was overwhelmed because I wanted to try them all.  I asked the worker (Austin) for a recommendation and he said the elote dog.  I went with that, and I wasn't disappointed.  Nice mix of sweet, citrus, and textures.  Bread was good, not a typical hot dog bun.  

We also tried the fried Twinkie and the garlic fries.  The spicy ketchup is good, nothing too crazy, just ketchup with a bit of a kick and heat at the end. 

Coolest thing was, he didn't rush us out or wasn't in a hurry. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Decent hot dog location, service was fast and employees friendly.  Suggestion would be to expand their menu a little bit as is limited. Food was good and tasty."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Reasonable prices and the food was great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has been on the fence about trying it out. 

I had the patty melt dog and it was so good."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious!  You can get hot dogs w/all kinds of different condiments on them. I love the buns too, they aren't your typical white bread bun, the bread they use is like a fresh baked thin bagel wrapped around the hot dog, unbelievable!  They have a good variety of fries too. It's too bad hot dogs aren't the healthiest meal cuz I could eat there every day if it were."}
{"text":"This place is OK. I give it 4 stars as everything I received was hot, fast, and executed well, but the toppings were just OK- definitely Mexican street food / Americana theme in play. I liked their lobster roll- style bun as it helps keep it light and not overly burdened with bread, focusing your attention and appreciation on the toppings and the dog itself. I think my favorite thing between the fries, dog and elote corn-in-cup was the corn! But all in all a creative place to get your hot dog & beer fix."}
{"text":"Great hotdogs and great place. I am a big guy and all I needed was one of there hotdogs to over fill me. Pricing was good and so was the customer service. If I was on that side of town agin I would stop by again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I am addicted. I love the Dirty Chili Dog. You cannot go wrong when wrapping your hot dogs in bacon. I just tried the Filthy Fries and they are amazing. Everything and everyone here have been amazing. It is close to work so that I can call in an order and have it ready for me to pick up. They food is great and the people are great too."}
{"text":"Eh... Food was ok. Had the house dog, some fries. Girlfriend had the veggie dog and a corn. Corn was bland and tasted pretty much like plain corn with some minor dressing. Her veggie dog was ok, not too great. Meal cost us about 20 bucks, not really worth it, probably won't come back. Disappointing because I love hot dogs."}
{"text":"The line was out of the door. The restaurant and staff are super nice and professional. They play lot of Tupac and 90's music. The theme is a Los Angeles theme. The restaurant is very busy. The food was good but on the salty side. The horchata was the bomb! Check this place out."}
{"text":"Eh. Ok dogs. Street corn was tiny. Music playing was completely inappropriate for children. I may go back to give it another try, but definitely not with my kids."}
{"text":"Went here with 3 of my family members and we were greeted with a 20 minute wait in line. The menus here were extremely readable and you have more than a enough time in line to know what you want when you get to the cashier. 

The cashier got everything correct in our order and made sure she repeated it so there was no mistake. Great cashier! 

There is a sign attached to the straps that hold the line together. It says \"You cannot take a table unless you have paid for your order and got a number\". The reason for this is because there is only 10 tables in this place. No room at all. 

We get our number and look around and there is a kid sitting at a big table all by himself. No parents, no food, or number on the table. The server brings our food and we pointed out that we needed that table and they weren't following the rules, that your business made. The server goes over and the boy tells her his family is in line. She comes back and doesn't do anything about it. She didnt wanna deal with it. So we stood there, with our food in our hand waiting for a table when there was one right in front of us but the employees wont inforce the rules. 

We got a table right next to the kid and his family finally sat down 15 minutes later... 

The food was great. No complaints there at all but I personally won't come back because that was completely disrespectful. You have rules, we are following them and you make us wait. 

So my first time and only time coming to Dirt Dog. 
Thanks for the great memories."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! we had the red dog and the green dog!! the red dog was better, lots of flavor! We also had the fries, corn, ice cream and amazing churros!! I can't remember the names. but very delicious!! will return!!! :) clean and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great dogs. Nice people. For dog lovers. I don't want to keep writing 
Still short
Comings. I'm done"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome dogs. Had the patty melt dog it was delicious. The chipotle aioli was so good. Also had the chili fries (can't remember the name now) but they were really good. Definitely recommend trying this spot. It was our first time and we will be back."}
{"text":"So good I want to eat myself sick trying all the bomb ass f*#^ dirty delicious food!! And they have a tiny little bar and nice dining area highly recommend!! I'm coming back tomorrow to smash on all the stuff I didn't try!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs were good. Hot dog and fries is all you need. A little far from where I stay but they are worth the drive. Good place for late night food."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Dirt Dog. I was running an errand on this side of town and decided while I was in area to give this a try. I had seen advertisements and reviews that were good so what the heck. It was not the easiest to find in the shopping center, But I may have entered the wrong driveway. I walked in and went to the counter and I ordered the Dirty Chili Dog and the Dirty Corn as well as a drink. The Dog was wrapped in bacon and cooked perfectly covered in a semi spiced meaty chili. I can't say that I was wowed but I was impressed with the Dog. The wrapped in bacon part is a signature way they cook em. The Dirty corn was exactly what I was hoping for. Grilled corn topped with crema, cotija cheese, cilantro, bacon bits and chili powder. Served with slice of lime. The Menu describes it perfectly so might as well use theirs. Firm Crisp Corn with a sweat crema flavor and a bite of heat from chili powder. I opted to not use the lime, but one of the neighboring tables said that was the trick to it. 
Thank you for dining  at Dirt Dog. I need to go here again and try the different varieties and take Josie for the corn. She would find it amazing. If in the area please go check it out. They have beer also by bottle and draft. I was going to a work meeting so I opted out of the adult beverage."}
{"text":"Great food good service just don't order togo because 3 out of the 4 times that I have taken food togo it was  wrong! This time around I even placed the order directly to the cashier in person and it still came back wrong."}
{"text":"Aside from the mouth-watering, unbelievably delicious and fresh food, Tiana was a complete highlight of the visit! SO glad I chose to have my birthday dinner here!"}
{"text":"Had the Mutt, house dog, green dog, garlic fries, dirty corn esquite 

Overall flavor across the board was average, the all beef hot dogs flavor were decent. The garlic fries looked a little sad, nothing like the picture on the menu in store. The mutt dog was fairly spicy, kind of a one note dog. The bun was just ok. The dirty corn was one of the better things we had. Service was excellent, very friendly. Unfortunately as hot dog joints go this one wasn't quite up to snuff."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom! I need more! If I wasn't eating clean right now, I'd be in line ordering another delicious dog and enjoying their delicious iced tea! Decor is big to me because it influences the atmosphere. Good atmosphere makes a more joyful dining experience! The divey diner look is amazing and the spot is clean to a tee! Service was good and my food was even better! Man o man! There's so much to try. I'm excited to order a different dog off the menu in the near future! Parking is easy to find and the location is great!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! My favorite is the brown dog. They even have veggie dogs! I love it here. I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Had the elote dog and al pastor fries. Both were very good! The fried Twinkie was also good. Didn't have to wait too long for the food. Place had a good vibe to it."}
{"text":"First this was the best hot dog I've had and I've tried many in different states and countries over the years.  I had the house dog on the lobster roll.....don't waste the 50 cents extra....hubby had it on a regular roll and said it was extra good. The onions were barely cooked certainly not caramelized and I didn't have any bell peppers.....wrapped in bacon no but there were bacon bits.  Still it was very good. Now...I had the dirty chips and my husband had the (or tried to have) fries with cracked pepper.  The first food out was the hot dogs.  Then my chips came (they were over cooked and tasteless) and then, after talking to two waiters we got my husbands fries.....should have kept our mouth shut.....they weren't good at all.  Mind you we were 3/4 way thru our meal.  The manager came out and compensated the meal.  I hate that....it's like you complained in order to get free food.  She offered to give us free items when we came the next time, comp our meal, etc.  BUT never gave us a chance to talk it over.  My husband took the free meal.  Will I go back......yes for the hot dog but will not order fries."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. These dogs are delicious! I've tried the green dog, the brown dog, and the pattymelt dog. You can't go wrong with any of them. Same for the Mexican corn and the desserts too. Although of the desserts, the horchata ice cream is my favorite. I only wish they were a little cheaper so I could enjoy them more often."}
{"text":"Abs-o-frickin-lutely the yummiest, most satisfying dogs outside of Hawaii! Umami perfection and such good fries! Go there after a long Vegas night and it'll get you right, I promise. We had the Patty Melt dog and a side of fries, which my hubs and I did split because hello, calories--but we were both so happy and enjoyed every bite. Service with a smile, and they will take your dogs to you, if you're seated nearby. Thanks, Dirt Dog"}
{"text":"Fantastic! First time trying the location on Rainbow. Been to the one on the strip passing by it. The food is amazing! Elote dog was seasoned to perfection and the deep fried Oreos were freshly made and paired with a delicious horchata flavored cream. 10 out of 10 would recommend to everybody."}
{"text":"So I have heard great things about dirt dog so I went in with high expectations and was still blown away. We had the Mexican corn that was better then some I have had at high end Mexican restaurants. I had the chili dog and my girlfriend had the house dog and to start with the quality of the hot dog itself is top notch and the toppings are fresh and liberally applied. I have had fancy street hot dogs from New York, San Francisco, and Vancouver and now have found my favorite ones right at home."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything is cooked fresh. Tried the house dog, dirty corn and dirty fries. Definitely be coming here to try some of the other unique items on the menu. The staff was really nice too."}
{"text":"Not as many dog options as I would have expected but I enjoyed the food.  The corn on the cob is excellent.  Fries were solid.  Dogs were packed! Service was great.  It needs some aesthetic help on the inside, but a great first experience."}
{"text":"Loved the food! But the service is what won me over!! Great people! Definitely recommend the Mutt dog!"}
{"text":"Sean and tiana were great the experience they had gave great customer service and they are probably the reason I will be back. Foods great"}
{"text":"Only did take out. The food was yummy and the service was friendly and on point. The brown dog and the dirty esquite  were delicious"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Friendly service. Excellent tasting food. Will definitely be going back and recommend."}
{"text":"They created a unique way to present a hot dog and it works. We tried the house dog, elote dog and the chili dog on Texas toast bread with sea salt and pepper fries. SO GOOD! Friendly service. Food was brought out in a timely manner. Can't wait to go back and try the other hot dog creations they got. Only thing I wish they had an outside eating area."}
{"text":"One of the best Gourmet Hot Dog restaurants in Las Vegas! I pretty much rushed over to this eatery soon after grand opening. The restaurant is nice and spacious. The seating is comfortable. They have board games! I noticed the music is very specific. Old school. You can view the menu and make your order as soon as you walk in. Be quick as a line can form quite quickly! I ordered the House Dog and Dirty Fries and I was hooked! The House Dog was super delicious. Full of balanced flavors. The Red Dog is amazing as well. I love the fries. They are always fresh and crispy. I recommend the Horchata Ice Cream!! It is AMAZING. I eat here quite frequently. They have excellent staff who are super friendly and help you out with any questions. I love the entire menu! I believe Uber eats also delivers from here."}
{"text":"This is like groan out loud GOOD! Have your dog on a lobster bun, because OMG! Shout out to Tianna who gave us all the history of the company and who recommended some BOMB food!"}
{"text":"UGH. I wanted to love this place SO. BAD. 

The good:

The customer service was outstanding. The cashier must list all the buns they have to every customer she helps all day everyday, but when I asked what types of buns they offered she was super patient and explained everything with a smile on her face. We were also approached a few times during our meal to see how everything was going and to clear any trash we had. 

My order was delivered to my table super quick. I placed my number on my table, walked away to grab napkins, and when I returned it was at my table waiting for me. 

The bad:

My food was cold. The hot dog had good components, and I feel like it would have been really good if it was hot, but I ordered the patty melt and the fries were cold and soggy. The bun was hot, but the inside of my hotdog was cold. The corn that I ordered was also pretty cold and seemed like it had been sitting in the back for a bit. The flavors were good, but I can't eat a cup of cold corn.

Five stars for the service, for sure. But the food today was meh. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely give it another shot though. I just wasn't impressed today."}
{"text":"Best hot dog Ive had! I am not a fan of hot dogs. I just never really liked them..but this place was good! I tried the elote dog and it was delicious. If you haven't tried this place i definetly recommend it! Will go back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Soon as you walk in the door, it's very welcoming! The place is very clean with very friendly staff member! Our server is Ryan, he's very tentative with his customers, he spent time to get to know his customers... I had the dirty corn and brown dog! Dirt dog has very tasty will definitely come back here... This place is worth trying"}
{"text":"Had a great time with my son eating here. The food was great & I can't wait to go back. I'm originally from L.A. & man I felt like I was back there. From the pictures on the wall to the music. I also like how quick people were getting their take out orders. But I personally will be dinning in next time I go."}
{"text":"We saw this place on fb as places around us while we are on our trip in vegas. This place was so amazing!! I got the house dog, my boyfriend got the brown and man, they were so delicious!! We also orded the garlic fries and corn in a cup, both so worththe but. My friend ordered the fried oreos, they were fresh with amazing cream to dip it in! 

If youre in vegas, stop by! Kind of Out of the way,but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I love dirt dog! This is my second visit here and I still love it. The first time I came here was during the Yelp Elite event. This time, I brought my family here and they loved it! Food is always made to order, which is fantastic! Food is delicious! Well seasoned! I believe we came during the weekend and they had one person at the register. The line was getting long to the point the next party that came through the door didn't know where to form a line.

I suggest they take orders at the tables for those dining in and keeping the register for take outs only."}
{"text":"Craving food from the City of Angels? This is one if the places that originated from LA. Located in a small shopping center in Southwest Las Vegas, you will find locals and a lot of people from Cali checking this place out. 

When you walk in, line to order is just ahead. Did not like that part as this creates heavy traffic that loops the line into the exit line and to the people entering the establishment. This makes it hard for new comers and repeated customers from deciding on what to order. The menus itself are displayed to the right side of the wall making it harder for people to take a look see at the menu. 

Inside they is pretty small as well, especially for those who have families to eat dinner with. There is a capacity of up to 30 people or so. If you plan on eating there come before 6 oclock. My fiance and I got lucky. Right when we walked in we were able to order right away. 

Now the menu. They are known for their hot dogs and the street foods. The street foods they offer: street tacos, fried foods (fried oreos, Twinkies), horchata ice cream w/churro, garlic fries, chips, elote, and a few things off the secret menu. 

What we ordered: the extra dirty chilli dog. You can choose from three different buns, but the one we chose was the lobster roll. The dog was dressed with onions, cilantro, chilli cheese, and topped with bacon. I ordered the horchata ice cream w/churro. We waited not long for the hot dog, but literally waited for more than half an hr for the ice cream. The girl working the tables and serving the orders had a bit of a miscommunication that I already received my order. Knowing that it was busy, she got upset, but later apologized. 

How the food tasted: the hot dog was a 3/5 as the dog looked wayyyy bigger in other pictures. Its smaller in person, and the taste was over hyped. The bacon was too chewy and the bun made it extremely greasy rather than that OMG factor in our mouth feeling. However, the horchata ice and churro made up for the rest of our visit. Churro was hot and just freshly made. Horchata ice cream concept made me enjoy every bite as the ice cream tasted like the drink. Cinnamon, the nuts, and flavor balance out well.

Overall, will come back to try the other food when it is less busy."}
{"text":"I am by no means a hotdog fan but I could not resist the curiosity of the very creative colorful dogs. I live in north vegas and drove 30 minutes. My husband and I had the elote dog and my kids had the patty melt and garlic fries and the food was the most delicious hotdog I have ever had in my life. There service is amazing and fast! It gets busy quickly and I see why! I hope you guys open another location. The food money and time was totally worth it! Also I noticed a lot of people did not like the 90s rap but if you don't like it don't eat there! It is clearly a CA owned business! Im from Cali! We love love love Tupac! The owner is did good with this because dirt dog created its own lane in the food industry! I have never seen or been to any restaurant like it!  Im sure there will be copycats bc it really is that good and its very unique total one of a kind!"}
{"text":"Very personable staff. Fun atmosphere. The best thing we've experienced since the hutzler banana slicer. Food quality sets it apart from other casual restaurants. No other hot dog compares!"}
{"text":"Aye the 6 white boys with hats wanna give it up to dirt dog and Anisha for the bomb service. Fire food"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!! So worth the trip if you live far away. If you've never been there before they are great about giving you info about their menu and your options. This is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Love it. Great environment, friendly staff and good music. Card games, dominoes and Jenga to play and keep you entertained rather than everyone on their phone zombied out. Food arrived fast and was delicious and filling. I love how they have glass bottled coke ( my favorite ) always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"This place was great! I was craving some Hot Dogs and had recently heard of this place. Glad I came! They had variations of hot dogs , Tacos and Street Corn. It was really good, but now I have to come back and try them all!!! They also sell beer which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"As someone who doesn't eat red meat, eating a hot dog is a rarity since I can never find poultry or vegetarian dogs; however, the Dirt Dog has the best vegetarian/soy dog that I've ever had! Unlike other restaurant, the vegetarian options mirrors those from the regular menu (you have different options for hot dog toppings).

This cafe style restaurant is based off of Los Angeles' street food. In addition to hot dogs, they serve fries and tacos and fried Oreos or Twinkies. There's also alcoholic options as well. It was packed on a Sunday night (for good reason) and there were literally no available seats upon ordering. Once a seat opened up, the employee was prompt and rushed over to clean the table. 

Everyone that we interacted with, whether it was the cashier or server who brought the food, was positive and everyone was super friendly. I love the overall vibe of the restaurant. 

The vegetarian hot dog was so good! Honestly, it tastes so much like meat. I already can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Dirt Dog has never disappointed and I have tried all of their dogs. My favorite is the brown dog. I'm so glad it's close to home. Although all the food is great my absolute favorite thing on the menu is the Churro Ice Cream. I can't visit Dirt Dog without having ice cream. It's AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Okay so it was a bit price for the size of the actual food because it's super good most definitely have to try it at lease one time. We'll be coming back for sure when I have more money lol. There fries are bomb and there fried Oreos omg just try it for yourself hahaha."}
{"text":"Walking in very cool atmosphere fun music playing, board games off to the side and fairly easy menu with a lot of options. I've been here a handful of time and must say the patty melt is the best dog. Fries go with the dirty and get some corn you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Had the elote dog and Carne asada fries. Very good. My friend ordered green dog which I wanna try next time and dirty fries. Everything is separate. Would have loved to see some crazy dirty combos lol definitely wanna try some of there desserts next time. Great friendly service. Thank you"}
{"text":"So there was good...The House Dog and the Sea Salt and Pepper Fries. Tasty, made well, I would get both again. The staff, atmosphere, and decor are different and give a thumbs ups. 
Step up on soapbox. T)hey do need a small outside eating area, my dog likes hot dogs, I like my dog and hot dogs; I would come here more often if I had a spot to eat a Dirt Dog with my dirt dog. Steps down from soap box.
Now the bad...the Brown Dog was super duper, like burn my tongue...salty. My hubby couldn't even eat it. I ate the dog after I scraped everything off of it and ate it alone. Then we got a Deep Fried Twinkie, the Horchata whipped cream was yummy. The Twinkie would've been yummy if it wasn't drenched in grease, we ate most of it but couldn't stand the layer of grease left in our mouths.
Price on par with all the other hot dog joints in town. I'd go back just because its close to home.
 In my book, Buldogis is still #1 for hotdogs in LV."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance and son came here for the first time and we are pleased with the food and the people who work here. We r definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"These dogs are a-ma-za-zing! I read all the awesome reviews and had to try it with the fam. Everyone had a different dog, and different fries. I have some picky kids and they LOVED their food. Unfortunately my 10 yr old dropped his hot dog onto the floor into his 2nd bite. Bummer! But the great news is that when I went to get a replacement dog, it was on the house and they were totally cool. Awesome customer service, they absolutely sympathize with parents and their clumsy kids. Also Love the decor and the canvas of Tupac by the register. This place is a must - We are definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"I had the brown dog and garlic fries. Hotdog tasted great with the red bell peppers, onions, and bacon bits! At first I was hesitant to order the garlic fries thinking it will be too garlicky but the garlic flavor wasn't too overwhelming and was just right. I went on a Sunday night and it wasn't busy. My food was prepared fast. Place was very clean. Will be coming back to try the other hotdog flavors and other side dishes."}
{"text":"First timer and i loved it ! It's pretty far from my side of down , very busy and packed but so worth it . Delicious and cheap dirty dogs !! Of course it has the cool laid back LA vibe . They played Tupac and ice cube the whole time . I most def will come again !!"}
{"text":"I don't think I want to eat another hot dog anywhere else ever again because I will compare it to this place. I normally take pictures of my food, but the moment the beautiful hot dog creation came out, I knew it was time to get to work. 

I had the veggie dog with the mutt sauce which is on their secret menu...basically the red and green option combined. The explosion of flavors you feel in your mouth is like nothing I can compare it to. I was so satisfied, I went up to order the corn and that was also mind blowing.

Also, the staff. I like those people. They're chill and the cashier greets you with, \"hey love\". I mean how cute? I would def. be back when I want to ruin my body. It's worth it. And when you're done it feels like the good kind of bloated, not the I wanna die bloated so that's a bonus."}
{"text":"Small place but the food is really good ...my daughters  and I came here we had an amazing time mostly Mexican food but obviously  hot dogs and they're amazing there frys are really good and the customer services is on point."}
{"text":"I had the elote dog, it was yummy.  I love corn  
Very unique spot for hot dogs. Next time I want to try the elote fries. I also had elote in a cup! Omg it was amazing.
The environment is awesome, they actually play great music unlike other restaurants lol.
This is for sure a go to spot. I definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"* everything was so good!!!
* staff was so welcoming and friendly
* the food was outstanding! We had a house dog and a green dog, with salt & pepper fries. Everything was super flavorful and delicious! The topper, and the must have is the churro .... with horchata whip cream and home made sprinkles. I can die happy now. #worththecalories. Will definitely come back... Maybe on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday & later that week on a Friday night. I would give 5 stars but it's pretty busy on a Friday almost so busy u could be having to take ur food to-go as there's no place to sit & eat. There should be an app to order & pick up for carry out as it would lessen the congestion during busy times. The atmosphere is dope with 90's hip-hop playin in the restaurant with radio friendly edits. The dedication to 2Pac is a nice touch as well. I did go there twice in 1 week so I must say I look to return soon to dive more into the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Dirt Dog serves by far the best hot dogs I have had.If you like Bacon wrapped hot dogs.You will absolutely love there twist on the traditional LA street dog.

My favorite Hot dog has to be the green dog!

Has a Guacamole Spread,Bacon wrapped, and bacon Bits Topped with onions and peppers, the elote they have is also amazing large seeing and also has Bacon Bits on it. Love the churros!



Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"At 2 o'clock in the afternoon they were very slow, I still had to wait 26 minutes for my relatively small to-go order.  Others who ordered after me, were long gone by the time they realized they had NOT served me. I watched what was to be my bag of food, sit on the counter for over 20 minutes waiting for Just 2 items. I inspected the food immediately in my car and the food was definitely NOT hot anymore.  Food was ok.  Wish I had tasted FRESH food."}
{"text":"Food is suck. Employees eating on the job. $17 for 2 hot dogs and a fried .   Cashier was very nice.  She gave us a free churro and it was not cook inside. Place was dead. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I just paid 13.00 dollars for a hot dog with mustard and onions, French fries and a bottle of water. I don't care how magical this hotdog is it's not worth that price. This is my first time in this business and it will certainly be my last!!!


Just finished the hotdog and fries. And yep not worth it. The roll was dry and the dog seemed over cooked. Avoid this place, save your money."}
{"text":"I have no idea what he hype is!    Food was so mediocre!  Customer service was great though.   I had the DIRT DOG & DIRTY CORN and so did my friend!   We both were no satisfied."}
{"text":"This place and its signage inconspicuous if you're just driving down Rainbow. But once you step in, there is nothing plain about this place. The first time we stopped in here was about a year or so ago for lunch with the kids. At that time they were kind of empty but the food was good! Yesterday we stopped in after my daughter's Volleyball game it was full but not annoyingly packed. I love the ambiance of this place, it very Cali-centric, with a huge graffiti mural and Pac playing in the background. But the food.. OOOHH let me tell you about the food! I had the house dog, which is their simplest of the dogs, but this thing was loaded. First off, all their dogs are wrapped in bacon, and served with sautéed onions and bell pepper. The house dog also has mayo mustard and ketchup. All the things I never knew I looveddd on a hot dog. It was really good. My only complaint- it was a little creamy with mayo and the onions and pepper being sautéed in a thousand island based sauce, next time I will do extre mustard or pickles or something to cut mayo. We shared the garlic fries which were extra garlic-y, which I loved. Skip these if you don't want to breath fire well after your meal. Hubby got a Dirty Chili Dog which looks amazing. Daughter got the Dirty Esquite, which is just Elotes in a cup, son got the mini corn dog kids meal. Which came with 2 Oreos and a cinnamon cream dipping sauce. Somewhere along the way, he decided the cinnamon cream was actually for his French fries.. . Great little lunch or dinner spot. If you live in the Southwest/Mountains Edge area and want something different than the chain spots, then you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, beer, & service!  Was especially blown away with the fried Oreos:)  Can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Maaaaaan I'm honestly speechless. I just discovered this place last week & I came back 5 days later cuz it's that good ! It's about a 40 minute drive from me & I'll keep driving the distance as long as their hot dogs stay as good as they are now. Beyond amazed by the flavors on all the menu items that I've had so far. Definitely recommend it. My new go to spot. & they have beer, even better."}
{"text":"Not impressed had the dirty corn which was cold,  the green dog and chili cheese dog nothing special.   The carne asada fries were way too salty.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"First of all, I downed 2 dirt dogs (house dog and the green dog). After that I had fried Oreos, IPA draft, dirty chips. Nuff said. This place rocks! 

Imagine your mouth filled with amazing flavors of bell peppers, caramelizing onions, bits of bacon, bacon wrapped hotdog embedded in a very soft-buttery-lobster roll. Then wash it down with the draft beef or the Mexican sodas! Bam! 

This place is highly recommended for everyone! If you haven't gone dirty. Get dirty with Dirt Dog!"}
{"text":"The table had several different dogs, two types of fries, Mexican corn, churros, and deep fried Twinkie.  It was all fabulous!!  Everyone enjoyed their food.  The service was super friendly, helpful, and fast.  Only hate we aren't local!!"}
{"text":"Was craving some gourmet dogs and Yelped the area and this place pops up. Perfect spot & delicious food. I ordered the Dirty Green Dog plus Dirty Fries. Delicious! Will be back to try more!!"}
{"text":"The best hot dog I have ever had! Plus they have elotes \"Dirty Corn\"! The staff is super friendly too. It almost feels like you are chilling with your friends instead of eating at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I have always had a great experience at the Los Angeles location , and was looking forward to MY visit here in Las Vegas . Unfortunately,  the customer service is lacking in Las Vegas,  the portions seem less and the prices are more. No organization here,the supervisor seemed high as a cloud, very rude. Was talking and bullshitting with employees while a line was waiting . She also answered the phone and held a conversation while the line was growing . Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Best place to go eat some bomb hot dogs good vibes and great service highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I can appreciate that they have a veggie option because initially the hubby saw them on Yelp and told me about it but started by saying: you can't eat there but this place sounds good... 

I had a vegetarian dog with a mixture of the green and red sauce with the lobster roll all the recommendation of the employee who was very helpful. YUM! The red sauce is pretty spicy and I like spice! 

*disclamer for vegetarians, they make the veggie ones as ordered so it may take a while for yours.  Give the register guy a heads up if you're still looking at the menu but know for sure you're gonna get the veggie dog.  

Their house made chips are bomb. The dirty fries are delicious and the sauce that comes with the garlic fries is really tasty. 

The group before us bought all of the corn so it was a 30 minute wait for the next batch of corn to be roasted. We ended up staying long enough to get the cup of corn which was a nice (but kinda random) side dish. 

Hubbs and his mom also enjoyed their hot dogs. I forget the one that the hubby got but he said it kinda tasted like a hamburger and that the bacon bits are legit. His mom had the teriyaki one that she gobbled up too. The menu isn't huge but I think it's enough to not be overwhelmed with choices. We will be back for sure, everything we had was good!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Still here, comtemplating getting some street tacos, but not wanting to overeat so we're likely going to come back later.

We split the Elote Dog and the Dirty Chili Dog- both of which were great!!  The Dirty Chili Fries were good (they disappeared pretty quick) and the Fried Oreos were a perfect ending to our trip here."}
{"text":"Supper fun delicious spot I love for lunch ... near my office and it's definitely a modern twist to Mexican food. Great vibe and great beer as well. lol  cheers!"}
{"text":"We've drove by this place plenty of times and finally decided to try it out.  Once you pull into the plaza it's hidden in the corner so if you see the Pho place it's right next to there (hopefully the Pho place doesn't close so you can still find it).  

Cons (reason for non-five star rating)
The bun.  My fiancé and I both ordered our hot dogs with an original bun and both were a bit hard, which made it hard to bite into. When we picked up our hot dog, the bun was completely split in half, like two pieces of bread with a hot dog in-between.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that, but it made the hot dog definitely hard to eat and super messy because everything was falling apart.  I think for a hot dog place, the hot dog and bun should not disappoint.   I ended up having to use a fork and knife.   What's the fun in that !  

Pros
1.  Friendly service.  Right when we walked in we were immediately acknowledged and she asked us if we've been there before.   We told her it was our first time and she gave us a breakdown of the menu.  Definitely a plus ! 

2.  Great choice of music.  There were plenty of times when my fiancé and I said, \"man I haven't heard this song in a minute.\"  Definitely old school hip hop with a combination of current music genres.   

3.  The dirty corn aka their version of the elote.  I definitely enjoyed the spices they put on it and the corn was cooked just right ! 

4.  Garlic fries, I would've preferred more garlic or salt on the actual fries, but I think it was a pro because I enjoyed the housemade garlic dip that it came with.

Overall, great first experience and I would like to come back to try other items on the menu and perhaps the hot dogs are better on the lobster roll versus an original.  I'll be sure to keep you updated !"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here today for lunch. I had garlic fries and the chili dog on a lobster roll. Man, it was amazing. The restaurant has great art on the walls and the music is wonderful.  The only problem is that it is a 30 minute drive from where I live. It sure would be nice to have one of these up in Centennial Hills or Aliante."}
{"text":"One of the best dog places in Vegas. Coming from LA and having Carney's and Pink's, I have had no shortage of finding a good dog. This coming to Vegas was a much needed addition. Have tried the Dirty Chili Dog, the House Dog and the Elote Dog and recommend the Hose Dog and the Elote Dog. The Dirty Chili Dog is good, had it on the Portuguese Roll, but I only slightly prefer Carney's or Pink's over it. The House and Elote dogs were great on the lobster roll.  Sauces, add ons, and condiments were a perfect match on both of these if ordered as is. Would suggest either of these as your first dog here on the lobster roll. The sweet Portuguese roll doesn't seem to work for me and may be why I wasn't sold on the chili dog on my first visit. Hint, ask them then to cut the dog in half and you can share with a friend and try a different dog."}
{"text":"I'm really glad I gave Dirt Dog another chance.  They proved my first experience was the exception rather than the rule.  Excellent  service by knowledgeable servers, who gave me great recommendations.  The food was even better than I had heard, make sure to get the roasted jalapeno on the side of you want to feel like you're back in LA.  Not only will I be back, I'll be bringing  friends."}
{"text":"Friendly fast service love it here! Tacos had enough meat crispy tortilla fries were also season well and the horchata was to die for def worth the 30 min drive"}
{"text":"Walked in, looke at the menu on the wall for a good minute, waited a bit more, looked around an empty place except for a cook in the kitchen.  Grabbed a seat, heard a woman speaking to the cook, said something about people walking in. We sat for another minute, got up and walked out.  The staff just blankly stared at us through the window in the kitchen as we walked out the door. No hello, no good bye. Are they out of busines? Too busy to help the only clients in the place? Don't know and wont bother to find out."}
{"text":"So good!  Love the decorum and the vibe of the place and of course the food was amazing!  Got the alote dog, dirty fries and dirty corn!  Only thing was the music was really good, it was just a bit loud when we were there"}
{"text":"Bro I don't know where to begin..but the staff on June 11th 2018 were sure helpful with my girlfriend bday! Time is around 915pm...so they hooked us up with horacta ice n churro dessert! Hella bb n she loved it!! Being our first time we will definitely beback again not just for the food but for the vibe as well! Thanks to the staff! Gracias homies!"}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to come in and see what they had to really offer.. since the only time i saw them was during a foodie event.. coming in you really feel that California vibe seeing all the decor on the walls (graffiti) and the music playing.. (hip hop / rap).. 

I was pretty bummed out when i found out that they had ran out of corn.. which i was really craving for.. and kinda upsetting since it was lunch time on a Saturday (you figure that more people will go and eat there on the weekend right?) - but i guess it was that good.. or a possible error on someone's part.. regardless.. i had something else..

wait time was a little bit long but bearable... once i received my order i went straight to my car and started chowing down... i was overwhelmed with how salty everything was.. and i needed to drink something every time i had a bite.. hopefully they fix this.. or ask for less salt.. 

im sure ill return in hopes they have corn next time around.."}
{"text":"Well I was hoping that this was going to be better and 3 Stars is a bit generous. I had the chili dog. It was tasty but the bun was not warm and the chili was cold. The bacon around the dog idea has been around forever but their dogs are fat and the bacon seems to work better with a skinnier dog. Fries were decent hot and good tasting . Service was good and timely. 
In my opinion they try to hard with to many flavors added, sometimes keeping it simple is better."}
{"text":"Creative and amazingly delicious hotdogs! Was surprised that the  menu had a wider assortment of food, not just hot dogs. From street tacos to creative dishes of French fries, I ordered the house dog and al pastors Fries and it did not let me down."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my boyfriend; dope decision. They play Tupac, their playlist is A1, and it just gives off a complete West Coast ambiance. It's really chill here. Atmosphere is great. The employees here are very welcoming, and have a lot of patience. This is the place where you wanna bring friends to catch up on life. I ordered the Chili Cheese dog with the lobster bun. Lobster bun is basically a buttery texas toast and it complimented the hot dog. Good food, good vibes. Would definitely come here again, and maybe spend time here a little longer if I'm not alone."}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of hotdogs but this was a great experience. Our group had the Brown Dog in Portugese bun, Green dog in Lobster bun, and House dog with regular bun. All awesome.

The horchata ice cream brought the house down though. That with a fried twinkie. Blows your mind!!! Mmmmmm. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"House Dog No Mustard + Garlic Fries + Dirty Corn + Horchta Ice Cream with Churro. on Point !"}
{"text":"So let me just start off by saying I am a huge hot dog fan and I am very hard to impress. I'm a Vegas native and with the exception of one other hot dog resturant I have been repeatedly disappointed. Dirt Dog did not disappoint. They have the best hot dogs I've ever had in town. The resturant itself is really cool. Very clean and new. The staff was super friendly and Amber was a doll. We had the House dog and the Green dog. Both out of this world.We opted for the Green Dog on the butter Lobster roll which was phenomenal. For sides we had the street corn and the dirty fries. Both sides were perfect. And for dessert we tried the deep fried Oreos. Delicious. I literally do not have one bad thing to say about Dirt Dog except that I wish they had opened sooner :) great job. Hats off to the owners and operators you really should be proud."}
{"text":"I came to your restaurant today prepared to pay for my meal and the Manager Kevin said that it was on the house all because about a month ago I came in and got my replacement which they made correctly minus extra cheese so Kevin said that this was on the house also so a shout out to you for making things right I appreciate it and I will be back soon and thanks again Michelle 
P.S. Everyone keep doing a great job here"}
{"text":"First time having Dirt Dog and I must say WoW...currently in the booth in a food coma so I figured Id yelp to pass time! 

I had the House dog on the Lobster roll and my girl got the dirty chili fries and Were leaving the scene with no evidence of it! So there you have it!!! Kudos"}
{"text":"The Dirt Dog hype is real! Their menu includes a variety of delicious gourmet dogs wrapped in bacon, tasty sides (dirty corn was fantastic), and house-made deep fried desserts. 

So far, I've tried the both Mutt (spicy red and green dog combo on their secret menu) and the House Dog and can't wait to try the rest! Unfortunately, the kitchen was out of churros but substituted some fried Oreos on top of horchata ice cream and it was great. If a more traditional dog is your style, they are happy to accommodate for the picky eaters and kids. 

A big plus for me had to be the craft beers available on draft, which included San Diego brews and local Vegas taps. Dirt Dog has a comfortable and bright dining area with booths and high top seating. Their west coast theme included a dope hip hop music playlist playing out the speakers and an urban city art motif reminiscent of the company's LA origins. 

Can't wait to come back for the best dogs in town!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had a really good take on hot dogs. The Red Dog is pretty spicy, the House Dog was flavorful, but my favorite was the Dirty Chili  Dog. The chili has a very unique flavor that is delicious, pair it with the lobster bun and its mouth watering. Garlic fries with the meal are a must and the dirty corn is very good as well. For those that are brace they have a bunch of custom hot sauces including Carolina Reaper Pepper sauce, and to try to tame the flames in your mouth the horchata ice cream is just the way to go. Overall this place is very good, but feels a little overpriced. Definitely worth a try if your in the southwest."}
{"text":"I'd give it 20 stars if I could!!!!! Go to it right away no delay just do it today. I'm sad it took me this long to find such perfection totally worth the 25 minute drive!"}
{"text":"Took the family here to try it out because it's close and I've seen ads for it. Everything was amazing! I got the patty melt dog, my wife got dirty chili dog, kids got chicken nuggets and we shared elote Fries to share. Everything was great! Definitely will be coming here again."}
{"text":"I came and I got dirty at Dirt Dogs... And I liked it.. Absolutely love the concept of hot dogs places with gourmet style menu.. Reminds me of killer place called \"Vicious Dogs\" in North Hollywood,CA. Ambience here was awesome, music was on point, blueberry beer was off the chain!, hot dog was very good with lobster bun. Melts in your mouth!!! This place would have gotten 4 stars if the garlic fries were made more the traditional route, but can't complain. Good meal with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is great! My husband and I love to come here for a quick bite for lunch. The homemade chips are fantastic! Dirt Dog definitely knows how to spruce up a hot dog and make it insanely satisfying."}
{"text":"Food is a bit over priced as well as a cup of beer lol after all it's vegas most places offer pints for $2 we paid $6 Here and the food it's simple stuff you could make at home one hot dogs runs $6-$7 I checked them out because I seen them on Facebook through an Insider preview and they looked good we are moving back to Cali so wanted to try something especially since they are based in Cali The food was good but over priced the atmosphere was dope though being in from Cali I loved the Tupac Vibe and the music I would come just for that"}
{"text":"Disappointing... Two stars for the fact that they have vegan options and because i did receive good service. But the food was not good. My vegan soyrizo taco was bland and cold. My veggie dog was just alright. Also i thought it was kinda funny that the inside is decorated around LA & pac but they were playing some biggie hahaha"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere that this place had. I loved the garlic fries , In my opinion the best thing on the menu!!! Hot dogs were hotdogs to me lol nothing that was extraordinary. The corn was eh ... I tried the hot Cheetos one .... and I didn't finish it"}
{"text":"We came in to check it out and loved it. The girls working there were very attentive and the hot dogs were delish!  Hubby got the House dog and I got the Green Dog. We both got fries and then ordered dessert. We ordered the churro with horchata ice cream. They were out of churro batter but made up for it by giving us deep fried Oreos and a deep fried Twinkie. I'm not big on twinkies, but throw a little batter on anything and toss it in a deep fryer and apparently that makes it delicious. ;). The ice cream was really good and the dipping sauce that came with the Twinkie was divine!! Horchata flavored whipped cream. Overall a really good experience!"}
{"text":"Wow delicious! So so good, why they used this terrible name I don't know, but the food is great.

The buns are soft but substantial and hold the many amazing topping and fillings in each dog. The chili in the chili dog is real meat. The hotdogs are scrumptious, they would be great even with nothing on them, so the toppings are all a great bonus! Ordered three menu items (instead of making my own) and they were all stellar. The first one on the menu was the best one."}

*2Pac How Do You Want It playing in the background*

Today, National Hot Dog Day, is the second time coming here. To my surprise, Dirt Dog had no idea (cmon DD, market this day and fill up these empty seats!!!).  

I love this place with a passion.  I have never experienced hot dogs prepared in this way before. They offer other ala cart items including Deep-Fried Twinkies, Dirty Corn, and assortment of fries. They offer alcohol if you wish. If you are looking for the ultimate comfort food, this is one of several places I recommend. 

The restaurant is clean and tidy, you can tell that the owners spent extra time to the details in their craft.  From the wood flooring, brick wall design, artwork, and bar feel, I can see a diamond on the rough with this developing Rainbow area, and I hope that this restaurant grows. 

Pros: quality Nathan's hot dogs, tasty food and flavor, quick customer service

Cons: not much customers even during lunch hour 

This time next year, I expect a dancing Dirt Dog mascot, a live DJ, and bustling restaurant filled with hot dog enthusiasts willing to increase their cholesterol for one day.

{"text":"Go on a weekday otherwise the lines are gonna be way too long. Brown dog was unexpectedly tasty. I suggest trying the ones OTHER than the house dog because honestly that just tastes like a regular loaded hotdog."}
{"text":"Spacious inside. Cashier was a super friendly guy. This is just a first visit so will revise after the next visit. 

Didn't do the small upgrade for lobster roll but seeing as I didn't enjoy the bun at all this time, I'm definitely going to try for the upgrade next time.

Wanted the Veggie Dog but they were out so opted for the Green Dog.

Went with 2 other friends and we each got a different kind of fries. I got the Dirty Fries and that was the best of the three. Friends got Garlic Fries, and Sea Salt & Pepper fries (quite bland). The seasonings are very light so we didn't really prefer them much. I will be back to try out their Dirty Corn next time as my side.

Gonna get a different Dog each time I come back, but for now, I would recommend the Dirty Fries if you're going to get any fries."}
{"text":"I tried this place with my nephew. We both enjoyed our chili cheese dogs and sea salt fires. Since it was our first time,  we kept our fries plain and opted to try their sweet buns for our chili dogs. Their homemade  chili  is very tasty. The atmosphere is unique and the food is even better. We'll be back. 

P.S. My brother tried the fried Oreos and loved them!"}
{"text":"My first time here, and I took it to go! The line may look intimidating but the cashier ushered through it pretty quickly. The atmosphere is great! Fun and lively. They have beers on tap, if that's your thing. It's not mine, but it's nice to know if I go here with my friends. 

I ordered \"The House Dog\", \"Carne Asada Fries\", \"Dirty Corn\", and \"Dirty Esquite\". I wanted to try a little bit of everything. But I really came here looking for the elote or \"Dirty Corn\". 

\"The House Dog\" is a bacon wrapped all beef hot dog with thousand island, onion, bell peppers, green chili spread, ketchup and mustard. I was a little skeptical of the ketchup and mustard, but it works. Absolutely delicious!!!

\"Carne Asada Fries\" is not to be passed up either. Yummy deliciousness in this brown little box. I couldn't wait to dive into the box and started eating them on the drive back to work. Pick de Gallo, crema, green onion, Carne Asada and fries. Maybe there was more to it. But this was soooo good!!

\"Dirty Esquite\" was just okay. Cup of corn, crema, cotija cheese, bacon, chili spices, cilantro and lime. I tasted some other flavors too.. but was overwhelmed by the saltiness. I'm going to have to pass on this one next time.

\"Dirty Corn\" .. the corn of my dream!!! Honestly, this dream will have to wait. I was so full from the other food that I couldn't stomach anymore! 

\"Churro\" .. this one totally had promise! Fried choux pastry with cinnamon and sugar.. and don't skimp on the horchata whipped cream dippers thing. I took a bite and realized it was raw in the middle. 

Overall, the food was reasonably priced. The House Dog is delicious! I'll have to try the street tacos next time. AND, if I had eaten the churro at the restaurant, I'm sure this would have been corrected."}
{"text":"Second time we've been here and this time took at friend! Just as delicious as the first. They even have tacos now, but we didnt try them yet. Instead we had a kids meal, a Green Dog, and a Red Dog . Love it all, especially the additional condiments and spicy options."}
{"text":"Saw all the hype about this place and how it originates from LA and i love me a good street dog when im in cali anytime. Walked in the food was good but not a wow factor for the price i paid for my meal. I ordered the elote hot dog which i could have made myself. Which is just grilled corn with sour cream cotija cheese and cilantro and lime wedge for garnish on a hotdog. Looked pretty. A tiny little basket of fries over sauced to soggyness were decent nothing too over exaggerate about. All of this for about $20. Way to overpriced for a hotdog and fries joint. The place is pretty cool with the murals on the walls of LA and LA celebrities also part of those murals. I definitely went out of my way find this spot looking for the hype everyone speaks of. Located far on southwest side of town. If im ever in the area again i MIGHT stop bu just for a hotdog but not driving 30min out of my way just for this again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. They were \"food styling\" and gave us a free hot dog from the shoot. I feel super lucky. And gotta love an establishment that has picture of Tupac as a part of the decor"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because I'd been craving a good hot dog. I don't eat red meat so it's hard to find a good hot dog place. Their menu has a veggie dog option so I was def in! 

Veggie dogs can go wrong real quick because they can be mushy and have no flavor. I ordered the veggie dog green style and dirty fries. They were a little slow but as soon as I saw the food I was like YUM!! This is one of the few times I can say the real food looks better than the photos on the menu! 

The dog was soooo good!! The frank itself was a little bland but the texture was perfect. The toppings had so much flavor that the frank didn't even matter. The dirty fries were amazing!! I wanted more!! Definitely coming back to try more of their goodies!!"}
{"text":"BEST DOG AND ELOTES IN VEGAS! Definitely a must have when you visit! Eli was wonderful, thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"I had the house dog and the dirty fries. Soda and deep fried oreos. I really enjoyed the food, will come again."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance tried this place two times and they are fantastic! Anisha was absolutely amazing both times we came and the food is to die for. We're from the California area and it tastes just like home"}
{"text":"We got our hotdogs within minutes of sitting down, (the chili dog on a lobster bun, and the brown dog on a sweet bun..can't remember exact names) both were super tasty. It did take a bit to receive our salt and pepper fries and our elote fries BUT worth the wait. They were both good, and hot! Definitely were made fresh. And for waiting we got an order or fried Oreos with horchata whip for free. We probably wouldn't have gotten these, ever on our own and now we will be getting them every time we come!! They were so good. And I really enjoyed the atmosphere and music..it had an LA street vibe. Pretty cool spot."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Customer service was amazing and so was the food!! I had the house dog on the sweet roll with garlic fries. The portion size was perfect very freshly prepared the garlic fries came with a very tasty dipping sauce if you love a delicious topped off dog i strongly recommend Dirt Dog. Very clean dining area and again their customer service is just as amazing as their  food!"}

L.A. loved and Vegas presented, Dirt Dog has spread its wings from The City of Angels and crash-landed in Sin City.  So hot!

We had just arrived in Vegas, buzzed and hungry, well past noon.  Southwest Airlines had a retiring pilot who ended up buying drinks for all the passengers on board in celebration of his retirement.  I guess when the pilot is buying, the flight attendants gets liberal with the booze because I needed food in me like 30-minutes ago.  After flipping through some bookmarks, Dirt Dog was chosen.  You know it hit the spot because we got dirty... so sooo dirty!

We got the Elote Dog on Texas toast [$7.25 + $0.50 for the lobster roll], a Dirty Chili Dog on Portuguese bun [$7.25], and one order of the Filthy Fries [$5.50].  That Texas toast was so buttery and crispy, it was hard trying not to moan with every bite.  If you love Mexican street corn, elote is for you.  The Dirty Chili Dog was a sodium bomb.  The Portuguese bun is slightly sweet so it helped off-set the saltiness a little bit.  Of the two dogs, I'd choose the Elote Dog over and over again.  As for the fries, they were amazing.  The Filthy Fries were topped with guacamole, chipotle aioli, cheddar, and cojita cheese.  I can imagine sitting back on a velvet couch with Chrissy Teigen in nothing but matching silk robes, eating these fries, while John Legend writes ballads on his piano about how awesome it is that I stole his wife.  He can keep Luna though.  She's cute but I ain't nobody's step-mom, okay?

So a place with 90's hip hop? Uh, yes please!  The staff is charismatic and friendly, the atmosphere is fun, and the food is great.  

TL;DR  I believe Knockin' Boots said it best in, \"The Original Hip-Hop:\"

\"Ooh boy I love you so. Never ever ever gonna let you go, once I get my hands on you!\""}
{"text":"Want an amazing Dog and all that food you love from the Rodeo or State fair like dirty corn and deep fried Oreos? This is the place, great food great price. Yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"The green dog is the best.  Their desserts are crazy good, especially the horchata ice cream!  The fried Twinkie with the horchata cream is life.  Their service is awesome, from the cashier to the waiter.  You order at the cashier, seat yourself and take your number, then they'll serve you. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Saw a video on Facebook... really wanted to try! Greeted as we entered, Sean, I think was his name, helped us immediately... orders chili dog, house dog, garlic fries, and carne asada fries. Everything was exceptionally delicious!"}
{"text":"Clean place, very nice staff and really good food! I just wish they had a larger variety of hot dogs instead of 5. The garlic fries were bomb, will def come back"}
{"text":"So, I never thought I would say that a hotdog was amazing. But Dirt Dog has opened my eyes to endless flavor combinations that transform a hotdog into a masterpiece. From the quality of meat, to the detailed presentation, and the impeccable service, this place has nailed the epitome of the perfect casual dining experience.

When my family arrived, we were absolutely clueless about what to order. Everything looked amazing, and were trying to narrow our options down. Luckily, the cashier was more than pleasantly helpful. She patiently and enthusiastically explained the menu. That kind of service is rare in in casual establishments. We ordered the mutt dog, the red dog, corn, carne asada fries and horchata ice cream.  I dont have one negative critique. Everything was phenomenal.  I only wish my stomach would have had more room for another hotdog."}
{"text":"Best LA style hot dogs in Las Vegas. Their Elote dog and House dog are both my favorite. I would recommend this place a hundred times!! 

I like to put avocado on everything. I ordered a side of guacamole to add that avocado feel."}
{"text":"Super funky restaurant. They play awesome music and the vibe is super laid back. While your waiting for your food they offer table games for your group. My favorite was the ranchero dog. The street corn is good, but could use a little less mayo... but that's only my personal preference. And don't forget to get any of the dessert! All to die for!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW! Brought my mother here when she was visiting from Florida and it was disgustingly good. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem. It was in Ballys. I love that they have nice pictures so you know what is what which is always helpful. I got the corn in Cobb. It was good! Also their hot dogs were delicious! I was so happy to see this in Vegas while walking around. You never know what's around until you look around and wander."}
{"text":"Truly unique place! Everything hotdog is wrapped in bacon, how could that not be amazing! The street corn is delicious.  I've tried three different dogs, each were delicious"}
{"text":"okkkkkkkaaaaay now!!!!
Let me tell you what I was expecting, and then I'll share with you what I actually experienced. I was sort of expecting a grittier, younger version of Pinks hot dogs. I mean, they both originate in LA, they're hot dogs, kinda trendy hang out type spots, and each one has made a home in Vegas. 
The Yelp reviews were good, pictures solid, menu I thought \"eh, not very extensive\" when compared to the OG Pink's. 
When I arrived, I thought the vibe was great. Board games, a game on TV, west coast rap over the speakers. I ordered an Elote dog, the person I was with ordered a chili dog. 
We had to wait 20 min, but didn't have anything better to do, so we happily sat around. 
When we got our dogs, the first thing I noticed (and did NOT expect as a first timer) was that the dogs are enveloped in a Texas toast/hot dog bun hybrid. 
Two of the thickest, most buttery, fresh and slightly toasted slices of Texas toast, but welded together towards the bottom to create this masterpiece of ingenuity. 
The Hot dog by the way (it's a hot dog place, afterall) was INSANE. Way better than what we're getting at Pinks. Guaranteed. 
The toppings on the Elote Dog. That's really a site and taste to behold. The perfect balance. 
As I was eating my dog...... I was already deciding which other menu item I would get to next. 
GO DIRT DOG and RIP to Pinks."}
{"text":"The house dog may be the best hot dog I've ever had. The garlic fries are awesome. Been here two days in a row. Great food, great music."}
{"text":"So good!! I like hot dogs, but don't eat them very often. What's more, I especially don't eat them out, because I tend to want more elaborate foods when I eat out or fancier ambiance than at home. However, Dirt Dog is a place where i actually am OK going to eat a hotdog. The decor is pretty welcoming for a casual place. Friendly staff. Delicious food! My favorite is probably the red dog, but really, I feel like you can't go wrong with whatever dog you choose. The elote is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Always heard about the outrageously good hot dogs.  Came in and saw thy it says Los Angeles Street food.  Atmosphere like nothing I've been to in vegas.  Rap music not your thing, Get the food to go.  Great casual lunch or dinner.  Board games to play.  Great place."}
{"text":"WOW! 

Stop what you're doing and go check this place out! 

They need more than one location. I thought I hated hotdogs until I tried theirs. 

A win win all around!

- Tasty choices! My personal favorite was the Chilli cheese fries and Green Dog. 

- Friendly upbeat environment.

- Tupac playing right when you enter. That scored points when I walked in and heard that, lol.

Needless to say, I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. They have creative dogs, fries, and deserts. The hot dog alone was amazing. There was a fresh snap when I bit into it and had huge flavor.

I got the ranchero dog and it came with beans tortilla chips, a red sauce and a fried egg. It was definitely messy but in a very good way. The red sauce had a little kick to it that really balanced everything out. My one complaint is that I really couldn't taste the beans. I think if I could have it would have been the perfect hot dog.

My brother and I went in there on a Friday a 2 pm and the place was packed. I was prepared to wait at least 20 min for my food, but it only took 5 to 10 min.

If your a hot dog lover you must try this place out!"}
{"text":"Went here for first time and I been so hooked they hot dogs elote and fries and beer is superior man I never b en to a good hotdog joint like this and they also have great music beer and games you could enjoy"}
{"text":"Food is great ! However there are No drinks available which is a complete joke! They are sold out of everything and have told us that everything we have ordered will be a longer than usual wait. No drinks for kids even though it comes with their meals, no tea, no soda for machines , out of bottled drinks. Had to ask for tables to be cleaned to sit down. We have been coming here from the opening and they are advertising so much they can't keep up! Where is the management? With all of the food options on s rainbow I'm not sure I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The first time we came was over the holidays and they were closed. We decided to drive back across town to try again and so glad we did. The food was amazing!  Probably the best dog I've ever had. I had elote dog and filthy fries, my husband had chili dog and chili fries. We were both so happy. I found portion size perfect. Filled up but not uncomfortable. Fries were crispy and delicious under the toppings. Also had a great kids menu although we didn't have our daughter with us we might bring her next time."}
{"text":"This food was totally amazing. Been to the original being from SoCal. And they did a great job. Good vibes in the place, staff was great and if you order a patty dog you can stand by and watch the cooks over the grill hooking it up. Very very nice !!!"}
{"text":"Super unique flavors, I loved the Mexican style twist. Super delicious check this place out your mouth and stomach will me happy! This place made me love hot dogs, the flavors are insanely good"}
{"text":"Heard good things. I was not disappointed. The house dog on traditional bun was the best dog I've ever eaten. Juicy dog, lots of toppings, but not too much to fall off, and the bun held up and was never soggy. The garlic fries very not too overpowering. They have a nice craft beer selection, with their December special coming with free churros (that were super delicious!). But my favorite was the dirty corn. So much better than the swap meet or what I make at home. And they cut it in half so my husband and I could share. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time tonite. Food was great. They need a tune up on the audio tracks playing. Felt like my gangstas gunna be bustin a cap in da hood with all the gansta rap playing. Almost made meal time unenjoyable"}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST places that's a semi hidden jem, inside the atmosphere is welcoming and of course they have GREAT tasting food...the garlic fries & chili fries are FIRE, the Patty Melt Dirt Dog is very delicious with the Texas toast bun....I rate it 5stars & will continue to eat there for days to come!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Enjoyed the chili dog and filthy fries. Not to mention, they play awesome music. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I love this place! Such good options and they have veggie dogs!!!!!! They always take care of me and my special needs, what more could you ask for. Great customer service and great food!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I cannot say enough good about this establishment. My husband and I were searching for a place to eat for dinner on a Friday night, and we came across Dirt Dog online. It was 12 miles from us, but the reviews were overwhelmingly positive and it had been a while since we'd had a good hot dog; so we made the drive across town. We walked in around 7 PM, and the line was nearly out the door. We thought about coming back another time, but we had already driven all the way across town, so we stayed. And thank the good lord above that we did. The line moved much faster than we expected; and once we ordered, they had our food at our table in approximately 6 minutes - which was astounding, considering how busy they were. 

We ordered two hot dogs, an order of dirty fries, and a churro with HORCHATA WHIPPED CREAM *screams internally*. This only set us back $23 (not bad for a Friday night dinner, in my humble opinion). Their Portuguese bread is perfectly sweet, and pairs wonderfully with the sweet corn and lime mayo on the Enote Dog; and the lobster bread (more buttery, and $0.50 more) was also very delicious and tasted splendid with the House Dog. 

Needless to say we devoured our food - every bite of which was absolutely incredible. We will most certainly be coming back. A 12 mile drive is a small price to pay for one of the best hot dogs in the city."}
{"text":"First time there last night! Had the Elote dog and since I was feenin' for elote, I also had the cup of elote they offer. The dog was delicious.. best hot dog I've ever had. But, the cup of elote had a little too much mayo in it for my taste, next time I'll just get the cob version. I will certainly be back. Let me mention one more thing, most of my good experience came from my interaction with Akia, one of the employees. She was an absolute delight!! Someone get that girl a raise!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went around 8pm, we literally ordered a feast because the menu looked so delicious. We got two dogs, the house dog and the brown dog, dirty corn, garlic fries, and deep fried Oreos. Everything was really good! The music was super chill, everyone looked like they were having a good time, we will be back!"}
{"text":"It was good it's fun it's a very expensive hotdog novelty thing nothing life shattering"}
{"text":"I have been seeing this place all over social media for the past month. Super excited when it moved here. This place was a bit of a drive from central LV but worth it. I was expecting the prices to be higher so that was an instant bonus. The food was good and ambience of the place was nice. Customer service was awesome, there weren't any negatives about my experience. I would definitely return but can't wait until they open a second location closer to downtown."}
{"text":"The place was slammed from the minute we walked in & now we know why. 

Good beer. Tasty dogs. Fun games. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I've been seeing photos of this place on social media so I had to try it out. I'm a pretty plain person so I had to ask if they'd do a plain dog on the Texas toast and I thought that was great. But my friend got one with chili, bacon, and cheese on Texas toast. The cheese tasted like it was a powder mix cheese instead of melted cheddar. So she wasn't to crazy about that. But she really liked the Flaming Corn on a stick! Mixed with hot Cheetos and again the same cheese. I got the Galic Fries and they were delicious. Then we couldn't pass up trying the churro. It was good, tasted like an average churro but the side sauce it came with was good. 

We went on a Monday night and had to wait about 15 minutes to order. We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a problem.  They also have beer which is pretty cool! 

Overall cool place. Wish it was a little closer to where I lived."}
{"text":"I love their menus, but it is a bit expensive and i need two orders to be full. It is a unique touch to dogs tho. Will come back again"}
{"text":"This place rocks dogs are great and I love the deep fried Oreos service is also good. Very clean and well put together."}
{"text":"I was surprised this place was empty when we came around dinner time on a Sunday. The place was clean and quiet, so it was a nice place to take two families with four kids. They enjoyed eating here and there were plenty of booths, so it was easier to take care of the little ones. 

They offer five variations of dogs with three choices of buns and six sides. Although I wish they had more options, I was satisfied with my red dog (even though I'm not a big fan of hot dogs). I also had garlic fries and the elote in a cup - so good and easy to eat!!! They do offer veggie dogs as well, so that's helpful for anyone that's trying to decide with vegetarian friends where to go for lunch without having to settle for \"healthy food.\"

Outside, there is not much parking, but the other businesses don't have much traffic either."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this place! I was so anxious to go here because of yelp reviews and the pictures looked awesome but I was let down. I got the patty melt and the biggest complaint and probably what really killer the experience was the hotdog bun. I ordered a regular white bun and it was hard.... not from being toasted but it tasted like it was a few days old. The rest of the hotdog was ok but not as good as it looked. The staff and the ambiance was good but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Great food! We ordered the red dog, green dog, ultimate chilly dog, chilly cheese fries, & corn on the cob... None of which disappointed my family. Yumm, will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Staff was very nice.. Ordered a house dog- bacon wrapped dog - California dog all the way... It was great! 
Carried a good selection of beer.. Suggested a Ballast Point sculpin of course!
Vanessa the Assistant manager was very nice and did a great job of taking care of everyone.
Glad I went back."}
{"text":"Everything from the sides to the dogs and even the deserts were amazing!!!!!!! I will be coming back and checking out the secret menu. 


Make sure to get their horchata ice cream. I want the recipe"}
{"text":"Love the vegan options. Garlic fries are amazing! Very laid back atmosphere and very family friendly. I always bring people here when we have out of town visitors and it's always a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"I come here for the corn! It's hard to come by street style corn on various sides of town & dirt dog does the job. The times I've been here it's always late at night, not many people & usually only one or two people working. No complaints besides maybe twice they didn't have what I wanted to order, likely because it was late. The place is nice inside I like the bar stools & wall paper. It makes a good display!"}
{"text":"Really good I advise you try everything.. The only down fal is they don't have enough space for the amount of people that goes there.."}
{"text":"From my experience, Dirt Dog feels like it's trying to be a modern restaurant coped with a Los Angeles \"dirty dog\" hot dog stand. Although it caters that theme by playing music that has roots in LA and incorporating art that can be found in the City of Angels, the dog does not hit the note of a true inner city street dog. Granted, the actual hot dog tasted fine (my dog was cold, my wife's was not) and the fries were spectacular, I would say I could come back to try some more."}
{"text":"Apart from the reallllllly long wait, I am huge fanatic of  Dirt Dog. It's hip, simple and inventive with selections ranging from vegetarian hotdogs to corn on a cob. I was smitten from my first visit as I choose from different styles of hotdogs. Who knew such a simple entree can be rather complex? 

For dinner, I had torn between the brown dog or the green dog which gives me the reason to return in the future. I opted for The Brown Dog which had teriyaki sauce and sesame seed aioli. Can I just have this everyday of the week, please? The hotdog tasted juicy with noting flavors of sweet and salty. The combination between the two really hit it off as it was finished by caramelized onions. 

I also had Dirty Corn which consisted of dirty crema, cotija cheese, chili powder, cilantro and bacon bits. For me, it was a 4/5. I think they could've made it just a tad better but this didn't exactly wow me. The corn was perfectly cooked but the ingredients didn't seem to mixed well together. Something was definitely missing there. Perhaps, a flare of heat? 

My girlfriend and I also had the Dirty Chili Fries which was not bad! A bit on the salty side but I wouldn't mind getting it again. 

As for dessert, we were offered anything we wanted on the menu due to the long wait. So we chose the Horchata Ice Cream. Delicious to say the least, and if I had a choice, I wouldn't share. Sorry, girlfriend! 

The long service is what sort of puts me off from visiting again. The food is delicious but when you're ready to grub, there's no way I'm willing to wait as much as we did the first time around."}
{"text":"Update: Went another time to try the elite dog and elite fries. Both were really good. The service was a bit slow since it was busy, but the food wasn't as salty as the first time. I still have yet to try any desserts as they run out of the ones I ask for. 

Was craving mexican corn one day and found out that this place had something similar. The service was good and the place is really nice inside. Haven't dined in yet, but I liked how they have their menu on the wall when you walk in. 

For gourmet got dogs the prices were fair. I got the house dog and the corn. The corn was a bit on the salty side for my taste. The hot dog was pretty good though. 

Next time I would like to try their desserts since they looked yummy!"}
