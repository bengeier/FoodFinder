{"text":"Great service and delicious food. Last night after work I came here for the first time with a few coworkers. Our server Maricruz was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. After we finished eating your chef, Mon Cheri came out to greet us personally to find out how we enjoyed our meal. She also explained how everything is prepared in house. Her passion for her job and your business was very obvious and the fact she came out to talk to her customers made the experience even better. I work at a store with in walking distance and have been looking for somewhere to eat on lunch. You have definitely earned a new customer."}
{"text":"Sports bar. Quality food. Decent BBQ. Great service. Shout out to Barb, Melany and Justin for always providing a quality experience. Happy hour is everyday 3-6 half price appetizers, 5 dollar drinks. Monday is .25 coin flip. You win, your beer is .25. Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"I'm an Illinois native & Sweet Home Chicago definitely brought the energy I remember from home. Food was great, energy was great & service was excellent! Angie Marchionda was/is beyond AMAZING! Very friendly, very informative & did a wonderful job all day. It didn't hurt that she is also a VERY BEAUTIFUL woman! Angie most definitely turned a good visit into an amazing first time experience! Great place for drinks, food & energy. I CANNOT wait to visit this establishment again next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Decided to go here tonight because I heard it was good. I have been to Rosattis at other locations and the food has been good in the past. Little did I know until I got here that it is no longer Rosattis. They still have the very cool dog statue out front and it appears to be very dog friendly. Met a friend there  for happy hour today. He arrived about 30 minutes before us. When we arrived we met him at a booth and he warned us right away of the slow service. He had ordered a salad when he got there and it had not arrived yet..The waitress came by and we ordered some drinks and after a 10 minutes or so we got them.(still no salad). Finished one pint and then 2 more friends met us there(still no salad) The waitress came back and took the drink orders again. We reminded her about the salad ordered an hour earlier. She had forgotten about it and said she was sorry and that it would be right out. 10 or 15 more minutes went by and still no salad. I ordered the Italian beef and sausage combo(the waitress did not ask if I wanted it dry, extra gravy, or dipped, nor did she ask if I wanted peppers or cheese on it. It came dry but it was a pretty good but not as good as Portillos. Somebody else ordered the Clamari, it was very bland and by the time it made it to our table it was cold. Another friend ordered the boneless wing and fries special and it came out cold as well. This place was not even busy, at best there were 8 other tables in there being served..Do yourselves a favor and go to Little Chicago instead."}
{"text":"Walking into this place just reminds me of being back home in Chicago.  We were greeted the door and allowed to choose our seats at the bar.  This is where we met Justin and Angie the bartenders, they made sure the drink glasses were full and we were attended to all day. Yes I said day with a team this good there was no need to leave and try other places. All of the food we had from the Breakfast burrito, to the beer nuggets, to the thin crust pizza and brisket sandwich were all very tasty. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Horrible place to eat and on this night the bartender Justin was a true blowhard and jerk. This unfiltered guy had an attitude from the start and just did not seem happy working the bar alone.  The food was another story. The calzone was miserable, undercooked and contained a metal piece inside the food. It was the furthest thing from a calzone in the history of Italian food. It was overloaded with too much salty tomato sauce and uncooked outdated produce. A poor excuse for food, but that is the way most Chicago style places taste. AVOID."}
{"text":"Sweet home Chicago is one of my favorite places to go! I always sit at the bed when I come, and Justin and Angie are always the best! The service is always friendly and fast. The food here is also great, especially if you want to stay and watch your whole football game! I would definitely recommend this bar to anyone looking for good company and good food!"}
{"text":"All is good. Service is always good and I usually sit at the bar. They will put on a game on a tv in front of you if you ask and there is no problem with others around which I love they ask before changing the channel. Always a good time here"}
{"text":"Oops.... what a mistake, went to check out Sweet Home Chicago, formerly Rosati's, things have changed, service and food, my family has met here for years since we are spread out all over the  valley, sad when the dinner discussion turns to where can we meet now  the pizza here is aweful, seems to be missing something, lol, certianly not lacking in soggy crust, let alone the service, maybe they will save this place with it's bbq, if you can find a waitress, Sad to say i will not be bac"}
{"text":"This place has great service and great food. I always sit at the bar and Justin the bartender is always attentive and full of character. Angie is an awesome bartender as well. I love watching football here!"}
{"text":"The salads were way better before. They must be buying iceberg from the titanic. Yum yum. Servers are amazing tho don't know about managers or bartenders"}
{"text":"Had an amazing night & great food tonight. We've been in before on a Wednesday & have been annoyed by some bad, obnoxious trivia Dj in weeks past. Was nice to enjoy the sport event of evening & the amazing staff without distraction! This is a great sports bar!! Mike the bar tender is the best!!"}
{"text":"Boy did I want to like this place! Sadly, Friday night will be my first and last time here. I read the reviews before coming and it was a mix of people either love it or hate it. A lot of people were upset that they are no longer a Rosati's. I didn't care about that, I wanted to check out a Chicago style restaurant with tv's and some good food. Well, I got the TVs. ?   I should have knew that the night was not going to be great when we had sat at our table for a couple minutes and very intoxicated man came to our table and solicited us for money. He asked if we had any \"spare change for a veteran\". The bartender saw this exchange going down, didn't seem to care or find it necessary to come ask the gentleman to leave. Ok, things happen. We order our drinks and a couple appetizers, deviled eggs and 7 wings. Also to be noted that the menu in the restaurant is not the same as what is listed online. So there were a few things we were interested in online that they no longer had. Again, things happen. It took about 5-10 minutes to get our first round of drinks (Diet Coke for me, kettle one and soda for my fiancé) and it took 30 minutes for our appetizers. At one point we could see my fiancé's drink just sitting in the well waiting to be served, but no one bringing it.   This place was not busy at all. Since it took so long to get our appetizers and our server was not very attentive, we ordered our entree when the appetizers got there. I ordered a burger with bacon, mushrooms, avocado and cheese, medium rare. My fiancé ordered a wedge salad with chicken. My burger took 33 minutes to come out and was well done. The salad didn't come when my burger did, they told us it wasn't rung in together. That sounds like someone messed up. So, I sent back my burger and they remade it and another 22 minutes later we both got our entrees. My burger was disgusting. Charred on the outside, practically raw on the inside. The cheese was not melted, the mushrooms and pretty much anything on the burger was flavorless. The chicken on the salad probably had been on the grill the entire time we had been there because it was so dry and over cooked.   The waitress knew we didn't enjoy anything, the hostess knew we didn't enjoy anything, but no one seemed to care. We kind of assumed the hostess was the owner. She was an older lady who acted like she was in charge. So I figured she knew we were not happy with the meal, I didn't need to specifically ask for the manager. In fact, after we paid (you know, the ENTIRE bill, not a single comp for a meal we didn't eat) the server obviously didn't like her tip, that's when the server got the manager for us to talk to. The manager doesn't care. He had excuses about new menus or short staffed in the kitchen. No. Your place is awful and you are a terrible manager. You can tell me you were going to take off my burger, but you didn't. You can tell me you didn't know there were issues with everything, but then your staff isn't trained well enough to come to you when there is a problem. Either way, you are the problem. And the icing on the cake was the rude hostess asking us \"what's the problem now?\" when we were waiting to talk to the manager. When we told her that nothing was good and we wanted him to be aware, her response \"we NEVER get complaints!\" I find that unbelievable, especially because I've eaten here and read your review. Also, maybe don't put medium rare recommend on your menu if you don't know how to cook it that way."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing whenever I come in, always get greeted and everyone is always super nice! Food is fantastic and I've never had a problem here at all. Just because the name changed doesn't mean the people or the place changed. There are plenty of tvs here and the perfect place to watch any game.  10/10 would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"So I decided to delete my review after I was attacked by two fake yelpers for my nice review for this place, so anyways I'm back to say more nice stuff about them:) anyways, if you're reading this then you should definitely come here to eat/drink. If you sit at the bar Justin is really awesome. Jeanine and Jasmine are our fav servers. I love the pizza and pasta. Cheap drink specials and darts and shuffle board for your entertainment:)"}
{"text":"Favorite hangout, love this place. They have only improved since the change from rosatis."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to hang out.  The atmosphere is casual and friendly.  Their menu is huge from pizza  to smoked meats.  Very delicious.  The potatoe salad is all fresh and made in house.  They use excellent ingredients thus the food is great."}
{"text":"Meet up some family from out of town here for a few drinks and some food..have to say although we had a great time, we were not satisfied with the food and the service. Granted we were a large crowd but kitchen service was under par.  We ordered the polish dog with fries and veer cheese, the sonoran dog and fries, 14 wings split with garlic parm and honey hot, the mexican street corn and the french fries.  Out of all the items, the fries and street corn were the favorities.   There was a delay in just getting our order in...server was always disappearing and it appeared the kitchen was overloaded with orders so things were delayed.   Can't say I'll be back anytime soon BUT the place does have large TVs - great for watching games."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero, I would.  We've been going here consistently for almost 2 years, when they started as Rosatis.  Literally, 2-3 times a week due to proximity and the vast size.  They have the same owners but the rotation of management has been terrible. The latest group of managers, especially Jim, are intent on running this place into the ground.   Well, they are doing a great job of it.   Food - average quality but 9 of 10 times, they fail to get the food right per the our order.  Smoked turkey is just lunch meat. Considering they have a smoker and smoke their own meats, you would think they could smoke the turkey per what the menu says.  The pizza sauce and beef au jus for the beef sandwich is awful since they switched off Rosatis. Completely misses the mark.  I blame the management on this, they tasted all the new recipes before the roll out.   Price - average price but it would be nice if they could actually get their computer system right. The $12 salad says choose your meat and no extra charge.  Every single time, 4 times seriously, it charges me $3 for the meat. The manager has to remove the $3. You would think the managers would get a clue and fix the system.   Atmosphere - it's a SPORTS BAR!!  How about having the sports games on sound.  And there is ZERO need for the \"live music\" EVER.  The Trivia Night should be sports trivia.  Again, management decision. Even during playoffs. Ridiculous!  Service - there are only 2 servers and one bartender that are worth it.   Most bartenders are more focused on each other than on their customers.  I have no idea where any of the servers are because the place is never busy.  Again, if management actually cared about service instead of hiding behind closed doors they would take care of this. Train your staff, communicate, and hire the right people.   Management - because the managers clearly cannot interact with people, they do not ever greet the customers, even the regulars, and do absolutely everything in their power to ignore situations even when the staff tell them the customer asked to talk to them.  They clearly have favorites because many, not all, of the good staff members are gone yet the most terrible ones remain. I really think the managers and the terrible ones run the good ones off.   Unless the management staff is completely replaced, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Our group of 14 went here before a Cubs night game. Everyone here was very accommodating to our crazy crew of 3 families. Jeanine was our server and she was great! She kept up with food and drink orders and all in our party enjoyed their meals-ranging from pizza to pasta to sandwiches to BBQ. Would definitely return. Fun place!!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago bar with a ton of TV's to watch all of your favorite teams! Their food is amazing...they have Chicago style wood fire BBQ, Vienna beef dogs, and Italian beefs that is to die for. It's a must visit spot for any sports or BBQ lover!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! I didn't expect this to be sooo good.  Ordered the brisket sandwich with the Mac and cheese as a side.  Top notch and I've eaten some good brisket in my life."}
{"text":"Angie Marchionda made me experience excellent! I loved the atmosphere and the friendly hospitality! Angie's service was impeccable and prompt. She cared about my day and made sure i had service at all times. I don't have one complaint! The food was really good and i would recommend this place to all of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"We ate here with a group of six and had great food, fabulous customer service, and found it a nice atmosphere with some background noise  but not enough to effect our ability to have a conversation. They have a new menu which is fabulous and our server, Christine, did a phenomenal job of offering suggestions, ie coconut shrimp, strawberry salad, chicken club sandwich, broasted chicken, and buffalo chicken wrap. They were all hits! For dessert we split brookies and bread pudding... yum!! There are two patios which would make great areas for closed parties. The prices are reasonable and we highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Holy crapola.  I keep trying to give these people a chance, I am positive the owners have no idea the workers are just not good, but I tried the dining area, coming in single to try to watch my Blackhawks, not being served by one, two, three different waitresses; actually reminding one I knew that I was here and needed service only to be told, 'Ive got the big table, I'll get someone.\"  Nope.    So I decided to play it safe and begin dining at the bar.    Frick and Frack(the bald guys) make eye contact, I look at the guy sitting next to me who noticed it too, 'we sitting on the wrong side?' he asked.   The skinny skin head served a drink facing the entrance and all he had to do is turn to his left and there we were, and there we've been.  Nope.     Chicago native, huge fan of Chicago sports, but holy crap, what a joke.   One Star for the name."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's fun to watch football here and the food is always good. Justin and Angie are very attentive bartenders."}
{"text":"Awesome place to watch the game! TVs are incredible... Angie behind the bar is phenomenal... Sit in her section!"}
{"text":"On e of my favorite bars and my favorite sports bar in Arizona.  Justin and Angie are two of the best bartenders I've had the pleasure of ordering from.  The bar has trivia on Wednesday nights and the patrons are all fun to hang with.   I recommend you come here for the food and drinks."}
{"text":"This used to be a Rosetti's. They recently changed hands, and became Sweet home Chicago. The first time we went there, we hadn't been waited on in 15 minutes, (they weren't busy) and we walked out. We thought they had just changed hands, and thought we would give them another chance. Three days before a UFC event, my wife called and asked if they took reservations. They assured her they did, so she made reservations for 8 pm the night of the fight for dinner. She called back the morning if the event and spoke with Dillon, confirmed the 8 pm reservation, and he said we'll see you at 8:00 tonight. We rolled in at 7:50, told the hosted we had reservations for 8:00. She disappeared for a few minutes, came back and said that they didn't take reservations, and they had no seats. When we told her we had made and confirmed the reservations with two different people, she said she didn't care, and they didn't have a table available. Needless to say we won't be back. Lots of sports bars and pizza places in Scottsdale. Don't waste your time. They suck, and she was rude and of NO HELP!"}
{"text":"We went here as a bar a few weeks ago. Bartender was great. Watched hockey. Good times.  Went here tonight with the fam. Probably one of the worst times and food Ive ever had. The fryer food looked and tasted disgusting, the servers were very inattentive and one was downright rude. We waited for 15 minutes for someone to get our order; 15 minutes after we were done eating for the check. The chicken strips looked downright gross, sent them back. Calamari was rubbery. Dessert cookie was raw.  The beer is cold.   Update: 5/23  Came here for hockey game: tried the BBQ pulled pork and a polish hot dog. The French Fries were much better today.   BBQ is worth it. Polish dog not-so-much.  It would be great if they at least put on subtitles during games. I mean, it's Stanley Cup Finals!!  TL; DR Come down, sit at the bar, order beer and bbq."}
