{"text":"Arrêt en coup de vent en famille entre deux préparatifs du temps des Fêtes, un peu grâce à la place de stationnement qui se libère tout juste  en face. Quatre pizzas différentes, quatre coups de coeur, engouffrées à la vitesse grand V, tant c'était bon. Bonne pâte, fromage goûteux. Service gentil et attentionné. On emporte deux lasagnes et deux minestrone pour se dispenser de cuisiner durant le congé. Gagnants de tous côtés! On reviendra!"}
{"text":"Je recommande cette place pour sa bonne pizza et sa lasagne congelée. J'ai été cherché une pizza un vendredi soir, il le font sur le champ et j'ai seulement attendu 5-10 minutes. La lasagne achetée congelée est tellement goûteuse, c'est un succès chaque fois!"}
{"text":"Good pizzas, maybe a little greasy but taste different, I liked it.  Nice point is you can choose two kind of pizzas and make half and half.  Frozen lasagnas and pizzas are available too, I like the concept ! And the staff is friendly, that's another good point for me."}
{"text":"We ordered in a pizza for lunch, and it's now evening and I'm still thinking about how good it was! It was great!  This is your classic pizza: doughy but not spongy, enough sauce but not too little nor too much. Greasy, but not in that cardboard coated in grease that passes for cheese way. Just right. You can tell this pizza is made with love.  It being an unseasonally cool day we opted to pay the $2 for delivery instead of walking the couple of blocks to pick it up. It was money well spent, the pizza arrived barely 20 minutes later, in all it's hot deliciousness with the crust still a little crispy.  I can't wait for nicer weather again, to pick up a pizza and head to the nearby park to enjoy al fresco. I've got my eyes on the prosciutto as well as the rapini and sausage. Or perhaps a sandwich to tide me over on one of my epic solo errand running expeditions along Mont-Royal. Regardless, ill be back!"}
{"text":"It was good, not great. To be honest the pizza was a bit greasy.   We ordered two pizzas. One was pepperoni and the other was a \"meat pizza with honey\".   Loved the idea of honey. Just wish it was more of a stronger flavor.   I did like how the pepperoni was under the cheese and not in top as is typical of american pizzas.   I would go back as it was close, just not my first choice."}
{"text":"Il y a peu de places assises, mais c'est parfait pour manger sur le pouce. La pizza était bonne, épicée a souhait, bien balancée entre la croûte et la garniture, et les ingredients étant frais.   Mon highlight a été du côté du service étonnement. Attentionné, rapide, courtois. Un bon endroit sans trop de prétention, qui fait de la bonne pizza et qui vous l'a sert avec le sourire."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousins. According to him it's \"the best of the plateau\". I'm not a huge fan of pizza, I'll eat it but it's not my first choice. It was a very nice surprise to see a 10% off coupon when I checked in.  The restaurant itself is very clean. I really like the neon logo sign they have. They have tons of pre-prepared dinner options. Frozen pizzas, pasta sauces, lasagnas, soups. I find that really convenient.   The staff greeted us warmly but while they were making the pizza they left us to chat.  We ordered a half all dressed and half paolo's special large pizza. Paolo's special is bacon, honey, oregano, cheese, and meat sauce. It took about 15-20 minutes before it was ready.  It was pretty good! I've never had a pizza like this. It was really tasty and crunchy. Much better than frozen pizza and come fast food pizza chains. It was a bit greasy but I think that's because of the meat sauce, which I really enjoyed so I didn't care. I only had the paolo's special side because I already knew what all dressed tasted like.  The large is enough to feed 4 people.  They do offer delivery for an extra 2$ which is very reasonable except I think picking it up is just as easy if you live close. There is a designated delivery area so either way, I would have to pick it up.  A bit pricey for pizza but for a special occasion or just in the mood for some quality pizza, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I heard of this new pizza place and put it on my \"to eat\" list. I was skeptical because it wasn't a 2for1 pizza place. My goodness, this pizza is amazing. I laughed at the other guy's review that said the cheese was good. It's cheese. But he's right. This cheese is gooooooood!  I tried the Hawaiienne: good! I tried the cheese: good. I tried the peperoni: good. It's my new go-to pizza.  For South Shore people, it reminds me of St-Bruno pizzeria and Miss Italia.  I'm gonna eat a lot more of there pizza."}
{"text":"Cuisine Pronto tes pizzas sont bonnes (miam la brushetta) mais je trouve tes prix un peu élevé. On peut s'installer dans les quelques sièges pour manger et voir l'avenue mont royal vivre. Je sais que tu es sur le plateau mais on parle d'une pizza quand même ;) Le truc cool c'est qu'on peut faire moitié moitié dans la pizza pour avoir 2 goûts et ca c'est cool :) Tu es proche de la maison et donc je pense que je reviendrais et tu gagneras peut être ton étoile supplémentaire. Ce n'est qu'un au revoir"}
{"text":"Wow première commande et PaS du tout déçu ! Très Bonne pizza et service rapide (Livraison)"}
{"text":"Cuisine pronto looks really cool and modern so I expected the pizza to be way better than at the regular cheap fast-food restaurant. Maybe the quality is significantly better here, but the taste really didn't convince me. I'm not a big fan of thick dough but it was OK. The topping was very cheesy and greasy, practically overpowering anything else on the pizza. I'm not saying it wasn't yummy but it definitely wasn't a gourmet style pizza. You can get the same kind of \"dirty\" pizza for half the price at a less fancy place."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting for work, and I walked about 10 blocks before I stumbled on this charming warm pizza place that smelled so go from the outside. Upon entering I was immediately greeted by an authentic Italian/Canadian staff which was very nice, but what followed made this an unforgettable experience. I had the cheese pizza and it might have to go down as the best pizza I've ever had. From the cheese, to the dough, to the sauce...undeniable! I think Montreal can finally stake their claim of having their own style of pizza now, and it's found at this place. Step aside NY and Chicago, there's a new sheriff in town."}
