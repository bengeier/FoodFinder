{"text":"Gave this 5 stars, but it's NOT fancy or upscale at all, just so you know that. What it is: Excellent food (see the other reviews), service (very pleasant & attentive, desire to please), & an excellent Value!   I had chicken taco's and my gal's beef (marinated) taco's were even better. (Soft tortilla's were hand made (they said) as ist all the food. Rice and beans were good (which for me means not fancied up or spicy). The Salsa was amazing!!! I always said you could make millions if you could get the roasted tomatoes and chili flavors w/o the burn/pain (I'm sure you can ask for the hot stuff if desired). Well they did it.   Margaritas were excellent (unfrozen w/ salt) Owners were most gracious named ,\"Beth and Bill\" (not the radio personalities).   Very relaxed atmosphere (jeans are great as goes for all of cave creek) w/ a few small TVs around over on the bar side at least (no sound heard, which I preferred).   Mariachis (probably just because it was Valentines) were a nice touch for the occasion, ... bit louder then I prefer, but they were very good and had the tact to not come over to our table since we didn't make eye contact. Nice voices and instrumentation to be sure.   Handi-capped friendly from what I remember. Private parking on the side was pleanty for a fairly busy Sat. night (w/ more out back). Light gravel made for no dust, and wasn't too thick so I'd guess wheel chairs wouldn't be a problem.   Not sure about reservations as we stopped on a whim, but with immediate seating on Valentines, I'd estimate no problems getting in,..least till the mobs at El Encanto find out about this place. :-)   Am looking forward to one of their breakfasts.! (would have probably gone with 4.5 stars if able.)"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had lunch at this place.  The place isn't much to look at from the outside, but it has potential.  It has a great location coming into Cave Creek and has plenty of parking. It could use a bigger and better sign (I would miss it a night). The inside of this place is old looking but that is part of the charm, finding a place with potential that has great food.  Since we have not been here before, we decided to go with the sampler platter.  The polla fundido was awesome, with a great taste of spicy chicken with a sauce inside of a burrito covered with some great cheese.  When they found out that we liked spicy salsa, they brought out some of their \"hot, hot, spicy stuff\".  It was great on the food and had me drinking plenty of ice tea.  The other items on the sampler were also good. They had a band there that played classic rock which made it a pleasant place to spend our afternoon being entertained.  We were told that entertainment was common for the weekends.  The regular salsa and the tomatialla sauce (green salsa) were good as well.  We decided to check out the rest of the place and found that it has 3 good size rooms and a large outside patio.  The outside patio has a veranda that may end up being a bar, but for now provides a place to eat outside, next to what appears to be a wood fire grill.  I think it may be the place where the locals hang out, since most them greeted one another and joked around while we were there.  The price on the food is reasonable.    I think we have found a replacement for the place we use to go to that has now become too popular (prices $$$) and lost some of it's charm.  With a little work on the place it will become a 5 star.  I think will try it on a Friday or Saturday evening, out on the patio under the stars.  We'll be back and I'll bring some of my friends, they love finding places with great food that no one knows about."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been back a few times, for both lunch and dinner, and the food quality has fallen off a bit.  The tortilla shells did not seem to be fresh this time with the tacos.  I guess the light red aztec design around the outside edge that transferred from the bag to the tortilla was a major hint!  Also, the rice was dry.  My wife's taco salad wasn't at all what it was in the past.  Very little lettuce and at least an inch of re-fried beans in the bottom.  She said she regretted ordering it this time.  We have had the same waitress several times since the opening and you still have to give her numbers, not names, when you order.  She is nice enough, but after all these months she should know the short menu and what is in the dishes.    I want to like this place more so I can finally have nearby good Mexican food...but it needs a lot of work to rise above average.  BTW, I agree with Mark.  The outdoors area can be awesome if they would just put a little work into it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite new spots! This is an authentic mexican restuarant & I loved it! I felt like I was on the beach in Rocky Point. We had the carne asada fajitas, chicken chimi & the fried ice cream for dessert. The steak was so tender & flavorful & the guacamole salsa they bring out with the chips at the beginning is to die for! They have salsa dancing on friday nights & the dance floor is pretty big. Great find :) Will for sure go here again"}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican restaurant in Cave Creek, alot better than the bigger one in the middle of town.  They have great food and a great staff.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all great.  The outside patio is really nice.  Just had my husbands birthday there with about 60 guests and it was perfect, great food and service!  Bill, the owner is very accomodating and is a pleasure to work with along with his staff.  My fav is the chili rellenos and my husbands is the green pork chili."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Authentic quality food, friendly service. Great location.  Highly recommend - especially for those who are tired of the cookie cutter mounded melted cheese places."}
{"text":"Wasnt really feeling it. If your in the neighborhood I guess it's worth it but don't make the drive. The food was just okay the service was really good but couldn't redeem my  tummies disappointment. I was super excited about their bottled fanta too but sadly it was flat. Just sad and flat :( Not worth the gas to go back. Everything was just ok I really thought the yelpers had my back on this one but I guess you get led astray every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Took one of my out of town friends who loves Mexican food here last weekend. She stated is was the best Mexican food she's had in a long time. We both loved the chips that were served to us before our meal.   The decor was ho hum and nothing special and our server was lifeless and hard to hear but overall the food made it a  good experience."}
{"text":"So good I orderd more for the hotel.  Recently on a trip I was driving esploring looking at homes and found this place.  It was out of the way and at the right place at the right time. Or maybe I was at the right place at the right time.    I was at that point were my hinger was starting my it presence well known.  I didn't want that fast food fix and out of nowhere.....  Not on the eligent list.  Dirt parking lot and it almost looked like they were remolding.  Maybe not.  I saw something I haven't seem anywhere.  Something from my past. Something of memorius gone with Grandma.  She past and gave my the best gift of all.  The love of food.  I am third generation Professional Chef and she was the First.  ALBONDIGAS!!!!!!  Ok.  So Good I ordered an extra and took it to my hotel for the next day.  I NEVER, EVER did that before.  You HAVE TO TRY THE ALBONDIGAS!  You HAVE TO TRY THE ALBONDIGAS!  I didn't ry anything else.  I didn't need to.  Remember the review seen of \"Ratatuollie\"?  That was me.  going back in my mind.  The one thing every Chef looks to acheive.   Thank you for a heart warming reminder of where i come from."}
{"text":"Solid Americanized Mexican food at a decent price, much more cost effective and better tasting than the place with the ducks up the street. However, the atmosphere doesn't compare. It isn't run down by any means but lacks a certain charm. Pretend not to notice the trailer with boarded up windows in the parking lot. If they spruced up the patio a bit it would make a fantastic place to spend a spring or fall evening. But oh my god, I wish these guys would lay off on the karaoke. One night a week is fine, especially if you advertise it on your sign, but I wandered in here with friends on a Sunday afternoon & these two bar stars got on the mic and would. not. shut. up. And they had that thing cranked up to 11. We moved to the other room & they still ruined our lunch. Karaoke on Sundays makes the baby Jesus cry."}
{"text":"I love this place.. Its straight up Cave Creek from where I live.. Its got a great outdoor area to sit at.. Yummy chips... awesome salsa.. great margs.. perfect.. THE only thing I dont like is the refried beans.. they have a plain taste.. but Im not a bean girl anyway.."}
{"text":"This is one our favorite restaurants. Yeah it's not fancy but the food we think is great. Ask for the grilled chicken for your enchiladas its great. Chips and salsa are always gone.  We go so often they remember us and service has always been great. We like it much better than enchant"}
{"text":"DH & I went there last night, the food was ok and service was ok. The service staff was fine, until they had to add the bill up, to let us know how much to pay. They made 3 addition errors on the bill!"}
{"text":"The salsa, meal, service, price, and beer selectIon were worth 5 stars to me.  While the dirt parking lot and the dining area interior bring it down a little, I'd say not that much considering its a casual Mexican restaurant, so I'd really rate it 4.5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow ratings with half stars.  Bottom line, I'd look forward to going again and I definitely would recommend it to friends.  Arrived and was immediately seated.  It was 7PM on a Saturday night and the place was full except for only two tables being left.  Looking around I saw lots of families were there and I counted 4 food servers.  The place looks like an older, private residence that had two separate additions to it for the dining room and then the bar.  Very casual and a comfortable, jeans type place.  There is a large outside area and since it was late November (60 degrees, brrrrr! LOL) a fire in the pit was burning.    Chips and Salsa promptly arrived from one server and as I noticed the green (Salsa Verde is my favorite!) another food server had a menu and asked about my bar order.  Mexican Beer arrived quickly with lime on the top  - Darn fast service.    The green salsa is outstanding and the red is not far behind, but I knew better than to fill up before my meal.  Mating it with beer counters that, LOL!   I had read Yelp beforehand, so had seen both Mark and Julie's reviews on the Pollo Fundido (price $12) and ordered the same.  The food server complimented the choice as one of his favorites so my expectations were high.   Rightly so, as it turns out.  Shortly thereafter the hot plate arrived with a nice soft, smooth fundido topped with its cheesey cream.  As my fork dived through, I found large, flavorful chunks of chicken inside.  The main was garnished with shredded lettuce on the far side, rice on the left and beans on the right.  The green salsa had no chance of remaining and I mixed the rice & beans together then poured the salsa verde over it. When I finished and asked the check came quickly and concluded a very nice, casual dining experience."}
{"text":"We come here a lot. Love the Margs, and the chips and salsa. Food is always yummy. Decor is simple. The people that work here are friendly and accomodating to my annoying kids, which is always a huge plus! :)"}
{"text":"Although the ratings were 4.5 on YELP, (being 40yrs in SoCal you can't help becoming a Mexican food connoisseur). The place looks like a dive in and out, but, tasty chips & salsa and drinks. Although the it's not authentic style, it was good Americanized Mexican food. Just OK"}
{"text":"I think this place is now closed. We tried to go last night but the sign was no longer out front and there were no cars in back! So sad, this was the ONLY decent place in Cave Creek to get good Mexican food. Even if the last two times weren't amazing we still liked it and are disappointed to see it closed."}
{"text":"So, our unintentional quest to spend every weekend in April doing something in Cave Creek/Carefree ended on a down note. I was craving Mexican food and margaritas and we had seen this place on our way into Cave Creek. It looked borderline hole-in-the-wall which we thought could be a good thing.   Before heading over I consulted Yelp (as always). Which by the way boyfriend now claims I refuse to try anything that isn't highly regarded by yelp users. I have to admit, it's kind of true.... does that make me some kind of yelp snob? Anyway, back to Los Mesquites.... The reviews were all over the place so I said I'd be willing to try it.   My thoughts:   *Outdoor area had some potential, but it wasn't very well kept up.   *16 year old karaoke birthday party was somewhat entertaining, but started to wear thin after a little while. Somehow Mexican food and 16 year olds rapping to Snoop Dogg just don't quite go together.   *The food was pretty bland and definitely \"gringo-ized\". My tortilla soup (that the waitress said was really good) was vegetable soup with some tortilla strips sprinkled on top. The refried beans were also bland. The chips and salsa were fine (house-made chips and decent salsa, though not spicy).   *The margaritas weren't bad, but they were nothing special."}
{"text":"Ok, I agree the tortillas are awesome. The interior is kind of ho hum, and larger than it appears from outside. There is a side patio that looks incomplete but has potential if the owners decide to do something with it. I asked if I could bring my dog, and the waitress said she didn't think it would be a problem. But I was not there for the ambiance, i was there for the food.   I started with a cheese crisp and it was loaded with cheese. I added the green chiles and they were fine but tasted like ortega out of the can. The tortilla was tasty. I also tried the chips and salsa, and the chips tasted like they were made there, a bit overcooked. The salsa was not spicy enough at all so the waitress brought us habanero  sauce to add, which helped. I had the pollo fundido and the chicken was nicely spiced and tender, the sauce was good but lacked the spiciness i prefer. The beans were again tasty but a bit salty, and the rice was a bit dry. I also had a carne asada taco and the tortilla was great and the meat was good, but a bit dry.   My take on this place is that they might be looking for the tourist crowd and have taken some kick out of their food. I am not a heat freak but a bit of spiciness is to be expected with mexican food. The portions were generous and well priced, and the tortillas were awesome. I hope the succeed because I hate El Encanto where service sucks and food is overpriced and touristy.  I would probably say 3.5 stars if possible. I will try it again soon."}
