{"text":"Its amazing how few reviews have been written for this place, we are from NYC and recently visited Montreal. On the morning we were scheduled to leave, we drove first to butterblume - and what a way to end our trip! We stumbled upon this place on google maps and the pictures looked terrific - we can now report that it was worth every penny and more! 

The food here is unbelievable - puts abc ktchen/clinton st. and many other \"go-to\" brunch places in nyc to shame! Gives 'farm -to-table' and 'made-with-love' a WHOLE NEW MEANING!

The yogurt and jam was to die for, the berry french toast was unparalleled, we had tartines topped with zucchini, lemon, poached eggs, and sesame paste ...heavenly! A must try..."}
{"text":"This café, recently opened, has a short but interesting menu that includes items suitable for brunch or lunch. They make their own bread, which I assume is used for the tartines -- haven't yet tried. The service is friendly, and the decor fairly simple but attractive (bit of a Scandinavian feel). I'll be back. 

Second visit: had a delicious smoked avocado tartine with a poached egg on top and excellent bread from Butterblume's ovens underneath. Delicious."}
{"text":"It's hard not to go inside and take a peek into this cute and minimally but beautifully decorated space.  I loved everything about this restaurant.  From the little items they sell on the table, to the flowers, the coffee is delicious, the toast superb, and the service lovely!  Thank you for this great experience!"}
{"text":"Interesting location on St Laurent right before the underpass, melding the mile end and little Italy into one. I went in for breakfast on a weekday and it was already hustling and bustling with people.

It's roomy and airy with friendly staff to greet you. The tables are small and all sort of centered in one area, a little squished but making you feel like you're in a busy French café. 

The coffees were good, a little small, but good. I ordered their housemade sourdough bread and their special tarragon/anchovy butter (4$) to go along, it was good- and a large portion. The menu hosts a small but appetizing breakfast menu (with a range of pricing and sizing) and I went with the (homemade!) yogourt and granola, with confit kumquats (7$)!- delicious to every last bite. I also tried, off their more extensive (and expensive) lunch menu, the smoked avocado toast with mushrooms and a poached egg (around 13$). It was crispy and soft and salty and tasty. I can't wait to try more off their menu.

They also have a few little things for sale at the front, hosting the stylish new café-boutique trend, but they don't overdo it, either. Also, the pastries looked absolutely divine- cauliflower cake?? Can't wait to try it. They have a take-out counter so feel free to grab a latte and pastry to go!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday and it was delightful. Food was fresh,  light and exactly what we were looking for in a midday meal. The salad of the week was a bean salad with cured fish- so good! I had never quite had anything like it before. The flavors meshed perfectly. 

I also had a wonderful glass of rosé and my husband had the gin lemonade which was incredibly refreshing. 

Decor matched the food- light, airy, minimalist. 


Overall a lovely experience."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant while visiting montreal and much to our delight the menu was outstanding, the service e friendly and the chef mesmerizing. Excellent quality food with wonderful presentation!! We highly recommend this food experience!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to give it 5 stars because I don't want to wait in longer lines! I love that this spot opened up in Mile End - it's perfect! It's cosy, but not super tiny so that you don't have to wait an hour for a spot to open it. The food is unique and delicious and it looks like they frequently have special items in addition to what's listed on their menu. Came here on a Sunday for the brunch, but looking forward to coming back during the week when it's more chill. 

Oh yea before I go - we had a lentil dish, chicken savory crepe, a side of bread and this butternut squash puree. Everything was super super tasty. A special shout out to the bread, which came straight out of the oven (or at least tasted like it) and was particularly delicious."}
{"text":"Love this little gem. Usually has a little line up on weekends, but never had to wait too long. The ingredients are refreshibg and portions are generous. They change their menu all the time."}
{"text":"First of all, you can't talk about butterblume without mentioning the decor and the staff. They display some real care in every details of the experience they offer, and that's what makes them so (deservedly) unique at first glance. But their menu is the real star of the of the show. I've been a longtime fan, visiting them at least once a month to check out new dishes. The selection leans on pillars of German cuisine (bread, sausage, rich sauces) but they manage to lighten them up with Scandinavian and Quebec influences using seasonal local fruits and vegetables. The result is simply great to stare at and addictive to the palet as everything seem to come together effortlessly no matter what you choose."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite brunch place!! I came around 10:30 (they open at 10) and the wait was already 15-20 mins. I got the bok choy, carrot, bacon cheese toast with a poached egg on top ($14). It's one of their usual items on their menu. For brunch, they change their menu weekly, so you're in for a surprise each time you go! I also shared their house made sourdough bread with homemade jam. It was so delicious. My friend and I both got lattes which were slightly cheaper than your usual latte for $3.50 rather than $4. The aesthetic is really nice, so be sure to take pictures. This place really reminded my of Olive and Gourmando because it's much more veggie based and they really use the most intricate combinations of food. The baked goods looked really good as well, but we were too full to get them."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Le Butterblume. Regardless of my high expectations due to some positive comments from some friends and relatives, I end up a bit disappointed. I ordered a german ravioli, which was supposed to be one of its best dishes and it was not something breathtaking. Nevertheless, I think it is a pretty nice place to have a coffee and a dessert. Also, I think they have a really good service, and everybody has a really good attitude towards the customers."}
{"text":"I like everything about this place. It's bright, welcoming, friendly. Food is fresh, menu items are original and seasonal. Prices are quite decent for the quality and quantity. I had German ravioli and expected something small (as usual for ravioli) but there was a huge amount of delicious stuffing and I could barely finish my plate. It's at ground level, accessible for strollers. It's a bit out of the way, not really close to any metro station, and still really full at lunch time, which says a lot about how good of a place it is. So remember to get there early!"}
{"text":"Vraiment un magnifique spot pour dej a montreal ! C'est beau, C'est bon , tout est parfait ! Ils ont des plats surprenant et très gouteux ! Je pense que cest le genre d'endroit ideal pour ajouter une touche special a tes brunch du dimanche ! 

Bref vraiment cool comme spot"}
{"text":"L'endroit est très agréable avec beaucoup de clarté et une salle très propre et moderne! 
Nous avons eu la chance de ne pas attendre trop longtemps alors qu' habituellement un brunch dans Montreal nécessite 1/2 heure à une heure d'attente! Et ce qui est agréable c est qu' il y a des bancs pour s'asseoir juste devant!
À l'entrée il y a quelques produits à vendre...dont des fleurs...pratique pour un RDV galant au dernier moment!
Les tables sont situées au fond de la salle et l été il y a une ancienne porte de garage qui est ouverte afin de laisser passer les rayons du soleil et une petite brise! 
Il faut préciser que les tables sont minuscules et qu'il n'est pas aisé de faire tenir tous les verres et plats dessus!
Nous avons commencé notre brunch par des jus d orange frais (avec ce petit goût acidulé distinctif du jus fraîchement pressé...) et nous avons commandé ensuite  3 rostis de pommes de terre et courgettes,jambon fumé, uf poché, crème sûre, paprika et carottes!
J ai été assez déçue du peu de choix qu'offre la carte des brunchs et une amie à finalement fini par opter pour le seul pain au levain....
À part cela les plats commandes sont bien exécutés même si pour l un d entre nous il manquait un accompagnement.....
Les plats étaient bons mais pas de ouahou.....
Le service est assez rapide et les serveurs sont attentionnés!
Je tenais par contre à attribuer une bonne note à ce restaurant car j ai eu l' occasion de me rendre compte que les toilettes étaient accessibles aux personnes en fauteuil roulant...ce qui a priori n' est pas chose commune à Montreal....donc un très bon point pour eux!!!"}
{"text":"Endroit différent des places à café ou à brunch traditionnelles.
Là, c'est plus spacieux, lumineux, blanc, moderne!
Non loin du métro Rosemont (prendre le pont) ou Laurier (plus loin mais plus agréable à pied), l'endroit est idéalement situé sur St Laurent et propose autant des brunchs que des repas ou des boissons chaudes. 
Nos brunchs étaient très bons et assez copieux. J'ai trouvé le café (latte) assez fort mais bon qd meme. Il y a des muffins, scones, cakes aussi.
Seul petit hic, les tables sont toutes petites, difficile de tout faire tenir dessus.
Sinon, très bon service.
Pour les parents, il y a des tables à langer dans les toilettes.
A essayer!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but nice things to say about butterblume. Amazing staff (a waiter accidentally spilled some juice on me and sent over a cookie to say sorry) really innovative menu (try the cauliflower cake!) and beautiful decor. It's just a great location for brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"I remember biking pass Butterblume in the summer and thought 'hey, that wasn't there before!' before wandering in and speaking with a lady, who informed me that they've actually just opened two weeks ago. Well, I've finally made the time to go back and it's quite the delight! 

Good: I adore the mini boutique and make your own bouquet idea. They carry Montreal brands, so extra points for supporting local! Butterblume has a charming interior that looks like it came out of a Pinterest account, which is very fitting for the Mile End scene. I came here for brunch and I've ordered the beets salad. It tasted amazing and looked incredibly pretty. Their cookies are also amazing, soft chewy and really rich. My sister ordered the roasted butternut squash, thyme, poached egg, pancetta & pumpkin seeds on bread, which is another flavourful dish. 



Bad: Too bad the portions were a bit small because I still felt hungry after eating. I was not a fan of the ravioli, maybe because it looked an oversize wonton. 

Bottom line: Definitely try it at least once. Maybe order a dish and another to share because the portions aren't exactly generous, but the food was so darn good!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here - a nice lunch of Ravioli Allemand and Avocado tartelline.  For desert carrot cake and poppyseed cake.  The food was really good, the service friendly and attentive despite being busy. The decor is simple chic - very bright and clean and the back has a garage door that opens up and gives a nice breeze. 
Definitely a spot we will come back to!"}
{"text":"C'est beau. C'est bon. Cependant, nous avons vécu une situation inadmissible et avons fais l'expérience d'un service qui fait honte à la profession. Après avoir consommé l'équivalent de 40$ en café et pâtisseries à emporter, on nous a fais comprendre que nous n'étions pas les bienvenus pour nous réchauffer 5min à l'intérieur (nous étions en plein tournage extérieur). 
En raison d'un imprévu, nous avons finalement décidé de nous asseoir à une table. La même serveuse a de nouveau manifesté, sans tact aucun, son manque de savoir-faire et de savoir-vivre en exprimant un timide refus. Refus qui s'est transformé en consentement gêné, car nos tasses à emporter faisait \"tâches\" dans \"notre ambiance visuel\". Assis, les regards persistants de cette personne perlaient le mépris et nous signifiaient de cacher autant que possible nos pauvres tasses, ainsi que nous-mêmes. 
Je me permets d'écrire cette critique acide parce que cet échange s'est apparenté à du racisme social et un délit de sale gueule, parce que nous n'étions pas assez blancs, polissés et conformes à l'homogénéité souhaitée par ce café (ou en tous cas par cette serveuse). 
Enfin, j'aimerai ajouter qu'un photoshoot se déroulait ce jour-là. Personne ne nous a demandé notre autorisation quand à l'utilisation de notre image. Mais bon, je me doute bien que celle-ci ne doit pas intéresser cette dame, plus habile à laisser transparaître ses préjugés que son professionnalisme."}
{"text":"I love that place ! 
Their homemade bread with their homemade jam is amazing ! Really soft bread with a crunchy crust ... 
The entire menu is strange at first, there is always one unexpected ingredient in each plate but the result is always a great surprise. They know how to mix flavors.
The place is also nice, really cute and minimalist.
Negative point: only few tables so be early for the brunch or ready to wait 
To try: Bread"}
{"text":"Stopped by Butterblume since it was so highly rated on Yelp. It's a cute location. Popular as it was packed at 2pm with a long wait.

Breakdown of 3/5 rating:
-The menu is pretty small but with fresh ingredients
-Ordered their only toast on the menu, cauliflower toast, pork bun, and muesli... recommend the cauliflower toast and toast (looks like it changes often)
-They don't really have a good waitlist system. When we walked in, no one came up to ask how many, etc and there was a large number of people waiting. When the host/server started taking names, it wasn't in order of the line. She approached whoever was closest to her at the moment and jotted their names down on a post-it. Took about 30 minutes to seat the two of us.
-Nothing too special and coffee wasn't amazing--- overall just meh."}
{"text":"The rice pudding was divine, the egg duck cheddar leek toast was good but not great (didn't quite come together as a dish), and the coffee was pretty mediocre (burnt and sour), but whatever the focus here is on the food and it's good. My sense is that the sweeter dishes (granola, muesli, bread and jam, and rice pudding) are the thing, not so much the savory."}
{"text":"This is a 6 star gig (if 5 is top notch).

From todays lunch menu ravioli dish to the impeccably designed, bright open concept, to the (near Narcissus reflective) varnished cement floors, to the takeout courgette cake, to the fact that everything is made fresh on the premises... the busy lunch crowd, the staff and the young proprietress; perfect! 

A big big labour of commitment, talent and love. .

Thank you La Butterblume! My weekend is off to an extraordinarily satisfied start. 

Worth every nickel!

Conveniently located  between morning yoga and home. How does it get better? Another freakin fabulous Mile End - Plateau gem!"}
{"text":"This breaks my heart to say, however, I've visited on three separate occasions to give this spot three fair tries and each time I leave, convinced, that they don't like English people. It hurts to say that especially because Mile End is a wonderful neighbourhood of both Quebecois and Anglophones/English-speaking people. The food is delicious, you'll leave smacking your lips, but the rude service trumps everything and makes for a place I don't want to support. People come first and the ownership of this spot needs a reminder."}
{"text":"Yummm what a perfect brunch! I took a Viennese-via-Vancouverite friend who was sooooo delighted to discover some traditional German items on the menu. We ordered the German ravioli and the fried bread and cheese balls, and the green salad and the tartine (basically avocado toast, which annoys me on principle but this was great.) Honestly, literally everything was really great, especially the German goodies! Give them a try! 

Both of us, almost as soon as we walked in, said: \"Well, I'm going to come here all the time.\" It's breezy and open and light and spacious and the baked goods up front looked glorious. Service was super kind and attentive. Prices are affordable and there are enough different kinds of things on the menu to share a bunch with a group and please all palates. There is beautiful local pottery and bags and plants for sale up front, and lots of bar and counter seating for the laptop warriors. The iced tea was the best I've ever had, and I can't wait to go back for a celebratory brunch with no work ahead of me to enjoy the super affordable and lovely sounding breakfast cocktails. Wonderful new find by the overpass, can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh, le Butterblume... cet adorable espace qui combine un comptoir à café, une mini boutique et un restaurant. 

Tu ne peux pas te tromper en allant là pour le brunch. Amène tes amis, amène tes parents, amène n'importe qui... ça plaira à tous!

Le menu subit parfois quelques changements quant aux ingrédients utilisés, mais les tartines sont toujours succulentes et les raviolis aussi.

Cependant, si je le pouvais, j'enlèverais peut-être une demi-étoile. La raison? Sans exception, à chacune de mes visites ils sont toujours en rupture de stocks du spécial brunch du jour (ils offrent une option sucrée et salée). Et ça me brise le cur, parce que ça l'air TELLEMENT bon et je voudrais trop y goûter."}
{"text":".Ahh le Butterblume. Je sens que ça va être compliqué de faire un avis. J'ai eu l'occasion d'y aller 2 fois et c'était relativement diffèrent lors de mes 2 expériences.

Le cadre : L'endroit est simple, cosy et sans surplus. Je trouve cela très agréable pour manger sereinement. Malgré tout l'endroit est tout ouvert avec les cuisines et relativement bruyant. Bon on oublie un peu cela en regardant les gens travailler car j'aime beaucoup cette idée. 

Le personnel est quand à lui constant et souriant et cela qui que soit votre serveur. En plus de cela ils sont aussi efficaces que la cuisine car les plats arrivent relativement vite.

La carte se compose d'une partie qui semble fixe ainsi que de quelques propositions pour le brunch qui semblent varier régulièrement. Pour ce qui est de l'addition c'est dans la moyenne des brunchs même si je pense que la quantité est un peu limite pour ce prix. Le verre de jus a 4$ pourrait être acceptable s'il n'était pas trop sucré (et je ne pense pas que ce soit sans sucre ajouté...dommage)

C'est au niveau de la nourriture que mon expérience est différente. Certes les quantités sont similaires mais les gouts bien différents. Comme pour mon premier passage j'ai trouvé mon assiette très jolie mais je dois avouer que le gout semblait moins élaboré. Les accords étaient moins fins. Je ne dis pas que c'était mauvais mais j'ai été moins transporté par mon deuxième brunch... C'est peut être juste une histoire de gout donc je reviendrais quand même."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience au Butterblume! La place est superbe, le service est parfait et les plats sont délicieux! J'ai pris les raviolis et ils étaient vraiment divins (c'est gros par exemple, je n'ai pas tout fini) et mon copain a pris la toast avec tout le kit dessus et wow ! Les goûts sont tellement bien agencés, c'est parfait ! 

Je vous le conseille !"}
{"text":"Nice decor and ambiance. Food was nothing out of extraordinary for a brunch. It was good, had to try it with so much buzz around this place."}
{"text":"Had my first experience at Butterblume today. I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent. 
The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good.
Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I'm still tasting the meal I had here. Completely delicious. Had FOMO after looking at the menu. Can't wait to eat there again.

One downside - hard to get a table, but understandable."}
{"text":"Cuisine maison réconfortante comme on les aiment!

Nous avons adoré, ma copine Janie et moi. 

Différent des autres endroits déjeuners et brunchs conventionnels. 

Un restaurant jeune, moderne et rafraîchissant!

À essayer et réessayer à volonté!"}
{"text":"Visited for brunch with friends. We were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait for a table which sounded reasonable, but it turned out to be more like 40 minutes. I ordered a sampler of various dishes, a miso creamy soup, pork bun and cheese toast with egg. Soup was kind of on the salty side. Pork bun was soaked in sour cream so much it killed the flavor. Toast was pretty good. I also ordered an eggnog with a hint of orange that was very good. Friends ordered ravioli, which came in some sort of broth which was very salty. Consensus was some dishes were too salty others were very good. Service was ok. For the long wait and the crowds we would have expected something much better. Good atmosphere for brunch. I would give it a second chance because half of the stuff we ordered was very good."}
{"text":"If you're visiting from out of town make this a go to place and if you're local then make a point to try it, it's tdf!
Recommend totally... the food is great the ambience is great the service is great, I'd marry it!"}
{"text":"I love this cafe. They have a great quality coffee, the design is very simple and modern. The service is amazing. They have German food on the menu."}
{"text":"Yelp should have a feature where, once a year, you get to rate a restaurant 6-stars. If possible, I'd return to this review annually and give my 6-star review to Le Butterblume. 

Here's the thing: most restaurants try their hands at brunch and many of them make it passable, but Butterblume brings brunch to a whole new level.

It's fun, it's creative and most importantly, it's abso-fucking-lutely delicious. Every bite freezes time as the flavours dance around on your tongue like they're Jennifer Beals in Flashdance. The food transcends time and space. It's like the Doctor Who of the culinary world. 

I have nothing but good things to say about Butterblume, and while I didn't eat everything on the menu, here's a quick review of the stuff I did have:

- Asparagus crepe: 
- Halloumi salad: 
- Beans with salmon jerky: 
- Fresh cheese:"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for brunch! I would love to go back soon. They offer brunch from Friday through Sunday starting at 10AM. Located on St-Laurent street just before the underpass before arriving in Little Italy. The space is wide open with a lot of light and an open kitchen. They have a corner at the entry where they sell a few magazines and some flowers. 

We sat on the counter just in front of the chef teaching her assistant how to make the food. It was definitely interesting to see them make the food, and then hand it over fresh to us directly. I loved the experience. I started with a latte, pretty good but unfortunately too small for the price. I also had the savory pain perdu. It was a piece of bread with little pieces of bacon and cheddar in it, topped with a perfectly cooked poached egg, cheddar and super thin slices of radishes & carrots. My sister had the tartine, which is basically a big toast covered with zucchini cream, ricotta, poached egg, some greens and shaved duck jerky. It looked so good, I stole a couple of bites and it was as tasty as my dish. 

The service was excellent as well, all the staff was friendly and gave us warm smiles the entire time we were there. 

For those who are a bit in a rush, you can come grab a coffee to go and pick up one of their pastries to go from their take-out counter."}
{"text":"Ouvert début juin dans le Mile-End, ce café a de la gueule, il est grand, aéré, stylé, mur de briques, luminaires, chaises... bref belle décoration...vous adorerez, ça va sûrement devenir un café chouchou du coin. Il fait aussi office de fleuriste, si vous désirez (unité 2$ / petit bouquet 5$ / grand bouquet 18$). Maintenant, au niveau bouffe, c'est service au table, j'ai pris pour mon petit déjeuner leur tartine avocat (oeuf poché, verdures, champignons marinés & jerky de canard) 12$ + un latté 3,50$ total avec taxes= 17,25$. Rien à redire, la qualité était là, délicieuse tartine et le latté aussi. Y'a bien sûr d'autres options sur leur menu pour le matin ou le lunch, des cakes/biscuits/muffins pour aller avec votre café / yogourt / granola maison / gaspacho / raviolo allemand / salade de tomates /....Beaucoup de staff (cuisiniers/serveuses) dans leur cuisine ouverte. Prix correct. Bon service rapide. Je reviendrai prochainement avec ma copine pour leur brunchs (vendredi/samedi/dimanche). Wifi gratuit. 

5/5 visité en juillet 2016"}
{"text":"Wow I was so fascinated by this place when I saw terrific photos and ratings about this place, but I was let down much by the service. Hidden behind their menu is a line of small words saying no laptop in their café from 11 to 2, I had to move from a table to the counter despite ordering food. I was more offended when I had to tell the staff 20 times that I am cold sitting at the counter because they opened the door and the wind was blowing at me directly.

I have to admit that the café is beautiful and full of vibrant colours due to many flower decorations. The coffee is okay, and I tried their been, caviar and salmon jerky salad, small portion but quite good. The price is quite high according to me because I find the quantity and quality were not extraordinary, but at least the taste is fresh and they have a variety of choices. The café can get quite crowded and they tend to ask customer alone to move to the counter (which is my case) because the capacity is limited. Try to avoid going there at peak hours (lunch time). The café is also closed fairly early, at 4PM, I find it a bit odd, but anyway it is not likely that I would return due to the bad service I received."}
{"text":"Delicious. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I ordered the salmon blini. It was good; I just wasn't used to the sweet aftertaste coming from the macadamia nuts. My sister ordered the \"pain brioché\" which was amazing, perfectly sweet.
Very hipster décor, and the prices are reasonable (a little bit on the expensive side)."}
{"text":"I don't know what made two Quebec ladies call their restaurant 'Butterblume' but I am certainly happy they did, because it caught my (German) eye when walking past on the way to Mile End. Although I had just consumed a large ice cream cone in Little Italy, I had to step in. The cheerful waiter assured us it was absolutely fine to stay for just a drink. The homemade lemonade and the iced tea (I think it was made from Sanddorn=seaberry!) were both delightful but I wished I had some space in my belly to try their food. I could see from the menu and from dishes served at other tables that it was right up my street. Creative, healthy, and beautiful takes on classics. I'd prefer if they had some vegan dishes on the menu but I will be at least a vegetarian for a day to try their delicacies when I return. Butterblume is worth a visit, even if it's not on your route. Just want to grab a coffee and a pastry to go? The interior design of the restaurant, the cafe bar, and the little shop area in the front are all so lovely that even a short visit will make you as cheerful as the friendly waiter."}
{"text":"What can I say?
Cool atmosphere - check
Great food - check
Great coffee - check
Vegan options - check

So why only 4 stars ? well this is the relatively new trendy place in the area so it tends to get crowded and the service (due to the amount of people) is a little slow. I guess once the buzz chills this will be a solid 5"}
{"text":"Brunch at the next level, it is more like a fancy saturday night dinner but they made it so you have no guilt in having it for brunch. The bread is fresh from the oven to the table which is a great concept. The porc i had was delicious there was at least 5 different flavours and sauce. My bf had the pancake that bread looked very fluffy. The only reason i didn't gave a 5 stars is because they have absolutely zero gluten free choice so they had non consideration for celiac person like me and i find it very irresponsable as a restaurateur nowadays to not be able to accomodate custumers with allergies. The hostess did gave the option to have granola in yogourt but what's the point of coming to a place like this and order something i eat every morning. So i had to peel the bread crumb from my porc dish which was contaminated with gluten so i got sick. Not pleasant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes now,so happy about this addition in the mile end.love the scandinavian decor.on the menu i love their soups,the changing brunch options,the fresh homemade bread and all the delicious baked goods.the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"A beautiful and airy space that is  refreshing to walk into. The food is savory and definitely on the healthy side. We tried a pineapple and coconut crepes that had bits of meringue over it,as well as a pork belly english muffin. Our friends had the muesli and granola bowls topped with fresh fruits. We also tried the cauliflower cake (so-so) and the \"pieuvre saisie\" (would order again). Although each dish tasted good, I think we left a little disappointed because  we wanted more variety in each of our orders. We did try many different dishes overall, but the tastes didn't quite mix well together. Also, the tiny cups of lattes did not satisfy the coffee drinkers in our group and we had to stop at Starbucks on the way home. I would certainly go back and try some of the savory dishes, they looked really interesting for lunch."}
{"text":"First, i would like to congratulate them on their excellent staff service. A gentleman came quickly to greed us. Very friendly and took the time to tell us that a table is almost ready to be leave, so we waited patiently. The place is cozy and clean. 

As for the food, another spectacular phenomenon! I dont really understand the vegan world and i ordered an Deustch raviolis (raviolis allemand). The taste is succulent and light. Very exquisite mesmerizing scent of herbs. 

Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Not many options for breakfast and they change their menu often so don't rely on what you see here. Their latté was so good, I ordered a second!"}
{"text":"Way more than a simple breakfast joint. Le Butterblume sets the table for a pretty unique brunch experience. Look further than you 2x eggs and bacon, and try this place."}
{"text":"Adorable cafe with amazing food and friendly people. We got the roasted peaches and frittata but the tartines also looked great. But mostly come here because rhe super nice servers and hosts will start your day off as a good one!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what butter blume translates to but WOW! I loved this place. Buttered and blumed I was! Decor is amazing, food was amazing, and service was amazing. Very impressed by all the attention they pay to detail. The onions were sliced so evenly and beautifully. Like why am I even writing about onions?! Because it was THAT impressive. Everything on my plate was intentional. Would love to be back someday!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of personality and refinement at this cafe-restaurant. I visited on a Saturday afternoon, and the location was crowded, so we got tea, a cherry brownie, and a scone with butter and jam to go as a lil snack. The flavours of the sweets were not overbearing; they were nuanced and really tasty. The location itself is simplistic and beautiful, but the character shines through in the food, service, and rustic hand-written cafe sign. 

If you're in the area, it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"We arrived a bit before opening and there was a line forming! Obviously this place is the bomb!!!! Modern interior, a variety of seating options, mostly food and drink but a bit of merch too."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for weekday lunches.

Tip: try to get there just a few minutes before noon, come much after and the place will be packed! 

Good for groups of 2-4, you'll sit either at the bar or small tables. Filled with a lot of young mom types, and classy mile end folks.

Come on Friday lunch, and you can order from the brunch menu as well! 

Butterblume rotates their menu, but always has the same base concepts around their plates. A fav of mine is the Tartine, which is a thick home style bread, topped with a light cheese, a veggies, and some sort of meat. Think of it a bit like Avocado toast 2.0. Friends often like the German dumplings! 

Another good option would be to get a homemade soup and a few fun slides (rotating). I often will take the cauliflower cake or a fresh cheese. 

I love their baked goods, and couldn't make it out without one! If their chocolate chip cookies are an option....just take it

In my opinion, this place is definitely on the pricier end, but it is clear they have put thought into the ingredients, seasonality, and menu."}
