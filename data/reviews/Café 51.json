{"text":"I was shocked to see there wasn't already a Yelp page for this business! I take my daughter to OT in the area and there are always signs for this cafe. Today I decided to follow the signs because they advertise Starbucks coffee! I found them tucked in the business park area, but my oh my are they good!! Their menu is extensive and their choices are unique and some are just what you're looking for... I.e.. My tuna melt. YUM. My husband got the veggie wrap with a side of potato salad, and I gave my toddler my fruit cup. I ordered the cinnamon dulce latte and it is superb! Definitely head over to this place for breakfast or lunch during the week."}
{"text":"Food was ok, had trouble understanding the woman taking my order. Be advised that this is just a little cafe in an office building, was not what we expected."}
{"text":"Neat little cafe tucked into the lobby of an office building. Menu includes breakfast and lunch options with burritos, sandwiches and bowls. They are also a coffee shop serving full range of beverages and Starbucks products! Friendly and quick service!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite little spots to have lunch.  I laugh sometimes because it reminds me of the CHEERS Tv Show because they know me by name and they usually call out what I'm about to order as soon as I come through the door.  They have a awesome lunch selection, though I almost always choose the Teriyaki Beef. I definitely recommend trying out Cafe 51 if you have not already done so."}
{"text":"On vacation from NY to watch some spring training Dodger games, stayed @ the quality inn & looked on yelp for a local place to grab lunch.  Great find, great food, good price & nice decor.  I had the beef teriyaki bowl special ($8.99) and a CA roll ($4.25) and the food was all very good.  This might be my lunch place this week!"}
{"text":"This is the type of review that I do not enjoy writing. What started out as a place with much promise, all of a sudden did a complete 180 degree turn. This morning I went in for a meat and veggie omelette which included ham, sausage and bacon. Really eager to try it I took a bite and all of a sudden my eagerness turned into frightfulness of getting sick. This is no exaggeration, the bacon tasted like paint chips. Thinking it might be my own delusion I had two co-workers try small pieces and they literally spit them out.    Giving Cafe 51 the benefit of the doubt I called them to inform them that something could be wrong with the bacon, and I explained the situation to the individual that took my order. He stated that it was the only bacon they ever use and have not received any other complaints. He did however offer me an option to order something else off the menu which I assumed would be no extra charge for the trouble (Not the case). I went back in and asked for the gentlemen who took my original order and it was not who came out to speak with me. The polite women who usually takes my order knew exactly who I was when I asked for the cook yet this time did not greet me or smile like usual, but blurted out \"Our bacon is good!\"   In a bit of shock I proceeded to ask very discretely and concerned, \"did you happen to try the bacon\"? She stated yes with out making any eye contact and asked what I would like to order,  I specified a chef salad. Again, without making eye contact she asked \"what dressing\"? I said Ranch please. It was at this point that she pulls out a piece of paper and began to calculate the difference in price between the omelette I purchased earlier and the salad I ordered (\"I assumed this would be comped for the trouble?). She then runs my card and simply walks away without another word. Her normal customers must of noticed her uncharacteristic behavior because they gave me a look like they were in disbelief as well. Roughly 6 or 7 mins later she walked my salad over to my table and dropped my salad in front of me. Again, without making eye contact and walking away she said have a nice day (With just a tad bit of sarcasm and a noticeably forced smile).    Here are my thoughts and I'm sure most of you reviewers might agree. It's not the fact that the bacon was bad, situations will happen and I understand. However, when there is a problem and customer service go's from good to terrible, it shows me the true colors of a business owner and/or management. Unfortunately, this experience was enough for me to stop going to this establishment anytime in the near future. Great customer service is vital to build rapport and trust between a business and their customers. When instances such as this happen, one can't help but question the credibility and integrity of that business. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, great location and fast service for other businesses in the area. If you don't try the everything burrito you're missing out"}
{"text":"These people are culinary masters. I had the Greek pitas and they were fantastuc. I also had the sushi and was amazed by how fresh and delicious it was. It did not taste like grocery store sushi at all. They make a delicious club sandwich as well. For a restaurant that makes everything, they do it well and it's cheap!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and quick delivery when I can't get away from my desk:)"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. I like the Breakfast All Meat Scramble and for Lunch the Cafe 51 Classic is always a winner. A lot of drink selections and they have the Starbucks drinks also. Reasonable prices as well."}
