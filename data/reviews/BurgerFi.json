{"text":"My family and I were all pretty impressed with our burgers! I had the double cheese burger, and I would say I did prefer it over a 5 guys or a Smashburger. My hubby loved the breakfast burger with an egg on top, and my other family members also liked what they ordered. The inside seating is spacious, and modern, and we enjoyed sitting outside on the patio. The fry portions were huge, and the vanilla custard was also yummy. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I took my Mom there tonight and we had a great meal, food was very good. We thought everything was cooked great. Thanks for great service! I love the Onion Rings Cheese Burger in Paradise!"}
{"text":"I visited this location on 4/2016. I'm from L.A... I've experienced THE best and terrible and everything in between. I ordered their cheeseburger (wasn't digging the bleach smell when we walked in). The taste was alright. Definitely above average but in comparison to other burger joins, I rate this restaurant average. The kids meal- cheeseburger is the same Size as a regular cheese burger. We ordered ours with a fruit side. I was legit expecting an authentic fruit salad (maybe small size) but it was a Dole fruit cup. Not bad, (thank goodness it was Dole ( other brands aren't  as good) but not a real fruit side.  We had a regular size order of onion rings which I found were HUGE! While the size is catchy, the taste --- ehh? The Clorox bleach smell when we walked in was an absolute turn off. I would suggest everyone try this place at least once. You'll either like it or dislike it."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a trip to Az and was pleasantly surprised!  I ordered the Burgerfi burger with jalepnos and bacon alternative style (like animal style at in n out).  Ordered a Red Velvet custard and San Tan IPA which were a great addition to my burger.  My wife ordered the quinoa burger and she thought it is one of the best tasting veggi patties out there.  Service was good, cashiers were friendly, and the decor was cool.  I wish I had the big ass fan in my house!  I hear they are opening in cali soon and cant wait!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, onion rings and custard! Fast and friendly service with delicious food. Can't wait to come back and try other burgers.   I'm a huge burger fan and have been trying out all of the burger joints. The burger is a good size and very tasty. I have never been a fan of onion rings but I am a fan of the ones served here. The batter is not heavy so you don't feel heavy after indulging in them. After your meal, make sure you treat yourself to custard. It's smooth and not overly sweet so you don't feel too guilty afterwards."}
{"text":"Short review:  Go, if you want a \"healthier\" burger in the east valley. No Go, if you want an all-round good dining experience.   Longer review: BurgerFi was one of the few healthier burger options I could find in the east valley, Arizona. I say \"healthier\" because I could not find a truly grass-fed beef burger joint, but this place has a brochure explaining that they use humane husbandry, sustainable practices, and natural ingredients for feed.   All that's great, but the atmosphere and service were not. Loud, incongruous music; disinterested staff, slow service.   Don't me wrong: Maybe this was an off night. BurgerFi certainly has potential to become a nice spot. But my experience was disappointing.  Notes:  Acceptable for ketogenic and low-carb dieters and Paleo or Bulletproof enthusiasts. Get the burger in a lettuce wrap.   One quality option about BurgerFi is the add-on selections: fried egg, avocado and guacamole are winners."}
{"text":"2 cheese burgers  ( one of the burgers had bacon added) 1- small french fries 1- onion rings 1 small drink    =  25 bucks    is way too much to  dish out ,  when  IN n OUT  or Culvers  is jst as good if not  better.   \"i said good day  sir!\""}
{"text":"4 stars for awesome food, knocked one off because they are trying to be a bar or something. Music is so loud cant even talk to the person you go with, and its like club music almost.  Awesome burgers, good fries, and AMAZING onion rings. I like it, but i go less often than i would if they werent trying to act like its a night on the town instead of just some dinner"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! Burgers are tiny and over priced. We order two burgers (breakfast burger), two sodas and a cry-fry (onion ring/ fries combo)= $38. You place your order at the counter, go sit down and clean up after yourself for $38! We could have gone to Outback for the cost. The ONLY memorable part about this place was the onion rings which were very good. If you are a burger joint and the only memorable item is the onion rings, you have missed the mark as a business. In and Out has better food for the price. Will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time yesterday and Heather was so helpful she was able to explain the different kind of patties to me and I had the all day breakfast burger and it was amazing the gm Michael came out and introduced himself to me and he was very polite. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"just left here after paying 12.40 for a burger with bacon and an order of french fries.... what a joke. fries are soggy. burger was overcooked and maybe weighed 4-5 oz. bun was ok. whatever sauce they put on it was barely enough to taste. I will not be returning or making any recommendations on this place. If you are in the area head across the street to AJ's fine foods and get a big burger at half the cost from Rick at the outdoor BBQ. cooked to order and fresh off the grill right in front of you!!!!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware. This place has some of most expensive simple burgers... I ordered the burgerfi and by the time I added cheese and bacon it was up to $$8.54 for a very small Berger. Fries and a Coke bumped it up to a $15.56 meal... Not worth it! I expect this prices in DC, NYC, Miami, not in Ohio..."}
{"text":"Bacon Egg & cheeseburger with onion ring & BBQ sauce. I think I have designed the ultimate burger. The Chicago Dog is amazing, great fries... Can't go wrong with the strawberry lemonade!! Love this place! A little spendy but quality is worth a couple extra bucks... My kids love it too."}
{"text":"Yum!!! We tried BurgerFi right after they opened and the burger was just okay. We decided to try again and it has been one of our favorite fast food restaurants. I love the regular BurgerFi cheeseburger. It is nothing fancy but tastes great and juicy. My only complaint is that the floors are sticky. Just a heads up the large French fries are huge even too big for two people to share."}
{"text":"Went on a steady Saturday afternoon to check this place out. I had been looking forward to trying this place out for a while. I should have gone to planet sub or chipotle next door. What appears to be a trendy burger and craft beer bar is actually just an overpriced fast food joint with one decent menu item (fries were really great); the rest is just McDonald's quality burger meat, complete with those awful corn-colored soggy buns that probably cost 1 cent each. Oh, but they grilled the word \"BurgerFi\" into it, how trendy! For a place that advertises themselves as \"natural\" you really expect a lot more. Didn't see anything that looked remotely natural in the place. If using 100% peanut oil qualifies at natural, then you might as well head over to Five Guys because at least you'll get what you expect to for your money."}
{"text":"We will not come back......  its too salty on burger and onion rings.   The coffee mocha shake does not taste like coffee but its chocolate. Also it is not healthy and too greasy"}
{"text":"Burger is good.  Strong wifi.  But really, it is an embarrassment to serve pale almost white tomatoes in the middle of summer.  Please!  Poor form Burgerfi."}
{"text":"I was excited to take my son somewhere that served meat, since we don't eat it at home.  If he's going to eat meat I wanted it to be natural meat.  Lots of noise, loud music, almost too dark to read the menu.  The lady at the counter rolled her eyes when I asked if the veggie burger had wheat in it, and she just stated flatly, \"Nothing in here is certified gluten free.\"  That was that.    In this day and age, it's not an uncommon request to have a gluten free option, and for all I know the veggie burger could be gluten free, but the girl behind the counter terminated that conversation by turning around and walking away from me, so I didn't ever find out and didn't get to eat at all.  My son's burger was pretty small, which is not a bad thing unless you are a teenager (he is), and he ordered Urban fries but got regular ones.  He was not terribly impressed with the burger itself, but ate it just the same.    I won't go back again, as there are too many places, like Fuddruckers, that offer more options and a more considerate staff."}
{"text":"The BIGGEST and best Onion Rings I've ever had. Truly enjoyed the Veggie burger and highly recommended you visit and have the Custard. It was delicious!!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are well made, garnished with lots of yummy stuff (cheese, tomatoes, pickles, etc.) and have a special sauce.  The French fries are especially good, but the onion rings were a little greasy.  Service was very good.  We went on a weeknight, somewhat early, so no crowds.  Several families were there.  Drinks are the usual fountain ones, but some are bottled, and both beer and wine are available."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad. I thought the hot dogs were delicious, but the burger was a bit too oily for my liking. I would skip the fries and onion rings for sure, but their shakes are pretty tasty. What stood out was the service, the location, and overall vibe. It definitely wouldn't be my first go to place, but I would check them out again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Sat night for a burger.  Service was friendly & relatively quick.  Hamburgers were fresh, hot, & juicy.  Fries are delicious!  Onion rings were very average, though.  They're way too big to eat easily - I could easily have worn one as a bangle bracelet.  The taste wasn't great enough to overcome the clumsiness of trying to eat them.  This place is OK.  If I'm in the neighborhood, I'd eat there again but I wouldn't make it a destination.  Just stick w/ the fries & forget the rings.  I also thought it was kinda pricey for what we got:  One single burger, two of their signature burgers, one order @ of fries & rings & 3 small drinks came to $37."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try, they've been open for a while so I thought the \"kinks\" would have been worked out... I was wrong.  I showed up at lunch time and the place was busy. I ordered a double with a fried egg, and regular fries and the wait began. It was was 23 minutes total, the Burger was ready in about 10 and it sat marooned on the counter, waiting for the fries. Now, plenty of fries were coming out, but none for my order. The counter staff didn't seem to really have a handle on fast casual dining. Finally someone who I assumed was the and  manager notice the bags just sitting there and asked what the deal was. When he learned my order and another person, who was waiting longer was waiting he directed the staff that the next fries should go with these orders.  The manager apologized and offered a $5 gift card for the inconvenience, but to compound the problem, the counter staff couldn't ring a gift card! A quick glance at the receipt for the gift card and my order showed 23 minutes to get the food.  The fries were really good and hot. The burger, was not hot, but even though it was \"warmish\" it was good.   I imagine the burger would have been really good hot. I will give it a try again, but next time I will make sure I have plenty of time to spare.  I hope this was just a bad day... everyone has one now and then."}
{"text":"Great job everyone. I felt inspired eating my cheeseburger and I feel like Obama would even like this."}
{"text":"We decided to try BurgerFi on a whim one Saturday afternoon when we were out shopping.  The big lunch rush was over, so it was not crowded.  The place seemed clean and the decor is nice.  The metal chairs were much more comfortable than they looked.  The staff was polite and answered our questions about the menu.  Unlike some other reviews, we did not have a long wait to either order or to get our food.  Our order was delivered to our table about 5-7 minutes after ordering.  That seems fine for made-to-order burgers.  Unfortunately, we found the food to be exceedingly greasy.  The wrapper on my guests burger was nearly translucent from the grease.  The onion rings were BIG and well seasoned, but literally dripping in grease, to the point of being inedible.  I had the Breakfast All Day burger and the egg was overcooked and rubbery and the bacon was undercooked.  The flavor was good and I wanted to like it, but the flaws in the preparation and the saturation of grease just ruined the meal for us.  The price was quite high for what amounted to \"clever\" fast-food.  We walked over to the Market District grocery and bought some candy and gum to get the greasy taste out of our mouths.  We will not be returning.  If you want a burger with unique toppings, go the Rail.  If you want fast-food, go to A&W or Swensons.  In between, go to Five-Guys."}
{"text":"Amazing grass fed burgers. The fries were not the best I had, but they are okay. The burgers are pretty fantastic. I just got the regular double, but you can get a customizable burger. Anything you want thats on the menu."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service, and better food. As far as pricing.. it's the same as five guys.. will come back"}
{"text":"Really great burger. Cooked perfect and juicy. Onion rings are the best in town. Not greasy and when you bite in, you don't get a mouthful of onion. Would come back in a heartbeat. Only complaint would be service. Their fast lane for custard and drinks was being used for everything so if you had a small order, you were stuck behind a long line. Then we had to wait for the other registers to have people to take orders. Still worth the wait."}
{"text":"I got a single with bacon and cheese, a side of fries, and a small drink. The burger was much smaller than I had expected. About the size of a single at Wendy's. The (small) fries were abundant. Much more that I could eat. The food was good, but not worth over $13. This place is crazy expensive. I'd give it a much higher rating if my bill were a few dollars less."}
{"text":"The food leaves a little to be desired  fresh handcut fries that are soggy because they were not fried twice makes for a poor quality product   I had the parmasan cheese and way to much cheese you couldn't taste the fries. Also the cheese is not a good quality    The burgers are ok for fast food but for the money the qualiry could be so much better."}
{"text":"Let me start off my saying this wasn't my first time here. The burgers are usually good but this time was different. Called in my order two burgers and onion rings. Told me 15 minutes. When I got there to pay I hand my card over to pay the girl fumbles around with it and then calls some other lady from the back which has a RBF. Comes right up and says oh it's CASH ONLY. I bet they pocketed everyone's orders tonight. I had to go next door to get cash to pick up my food and both burgers and order of onion rings was so COLD that we just tossed it out once we got home. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch only to find out about the lunch special.  What a great deal!!  I ordered The CEO burger the special come with fries, one giant onion ring and a drink.  Burger was served hot and juicy.  Topping were perfect.    Love the fries!!!"}
{"text":"Food: Burger patty was cooked perfectly and cajun fries and bun were nice and crisp with just the right amount of crunch! Unlike some other restaurants, everything is made fresh to order so you never get a dry piece of meat or stale fries. Coke machine was neat and fun to use if you've never seen one before.  Decor: Restaurant was tidy and squeaky clean! Modern, hip and easy on the eyes.  Service: Girl who took my order was very patient. I was going back and forth between a few options and even though there were customers behind me, all my ques were answered and I never felt rushed. Food did take some time to come out~10mins but what do you expect when it's made to order.  Verdict: Def putting this place into rotation. A little worried I may end up gaining a few unwanted lbs if I frequent it more than I should!"}
{"text":"Burgerfi reminded me of my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh, Burgatory. From the decor to the taste! Burgatory has a leg up in many areas, but that also includes price so I'll live without!  My visit to Burgerfi was prompted because I recently adopted the AIP Paleo diet for health reasons, and I was feeling particularly overwhelmed with all the added complications to my life. Since their meat is of significantly higher quality than normal restaurant meat, I was so excited to try it! I unfortunately had to make my own bun, but I did love the branding on my husband's. My burger was also relatively naked, with only grilled onions and grilled mushrooms, but OH MAN. Biting into it was the best thing I could have done for my emotional well being that night. And physical, of course :) The best part? It's within walking distance."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I recently went two days in a row!! I'm very OBSESSED with their Quinoa Burger on lettuce...no bun!! It's beyond tasty and has this amazing crunch to it!! My mother-in-law got a burger on lettuce and loved it as well! It's a cool and clean place. I'm def going again this weekend, probably two days in a row again..lol"}
{"text":"I went to Burgerfi with my family over the weekend.  My husband had the triple burger and was actually full afterward and he never leaves a restaurant full!  I have had pretty much every veggie burger in town and this one is the best, very filling and very fresh.  Great options for kids as well.  The fries and onion rings are tasty! Very clean, nice staff, and nice patio with big tables as well.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  Where else can you get an all natural burger, not anywhere I know of where we live.  The price is perfect for what you get.  When the ingredients are quality that comes at a price and even still it is really well priced.  Everything we had was delicious and we also appreciated the \"green\" atmosphere.  We are going to for our second time tonight.  It is nice to know that there is another \"fast food\" restaurant that meet the food standards of our family, so little do."}
{"text":"There really isn't anything wrong with this place, but a few things prevent it from earning 4, maybe even 5 stars.   I came in during a down time, around 3pm on a weekday. There were two other small parties in the entire restaurant. Right away you'll notice the great interior, which is probably the best of any burger joint around.   My order consisted of their basic double cheeseburger, regular fries with parmesan and herbs, and a Fat Tire. Grand total was $15 even. Even though I could have saved a little money by getting plain fries and a soda instead of a beer, this is pretty pricey for a burger place. My order also took 11 minutes, which isn't too bad, but I can't imagine how long it takes during the lunch rush. It's not like they only had two employees working.   First thing you'll notice when you get your food is that the size of the double burger is about average, while the regular fries are ridiculously huge. Definitely enough for two people to split. I would prefer if they offered an even smaller size of fries and charged less for it. Chances are, your burger will be gone and you'll still have plenty of fries left. I'm the type of person who likes fries, but LOVES burgers, so I would prefer the burger to be the main part of my meal. Now, the burger itself was pretty tasty, but not excellent. I really appreciate the sustainable aspects of the beef, and don't mind paying a little more for that, but the toppings and bun left something to be desired. The beef is great, but the rest of the burger just prevents it from being all together \"excellent.\"   I'll definitely give this place a few more chances to try some of their other burger combinations and their onion rings. Even with a soda in place of a beer, you're still looking at around $13+ for your meal, which is a good $6 more than In-N-Out. So it won't necessarily be my \"go-to\" burger destination in the future."}
{"text":"Not a great burger. It might have been the sauce? Was it a mustard base? And definitely not worth it for the price. The fries were the only redeeming quality."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting and it went a little down hill.    When we walked in (much like the first time) there seemed to be 15 people working and no one was a cashier or could take our order.  After waiting a while for someone to acknowledge us, we began to place our order when the cashier stopped us mid sentence and asked us if we would be paying with cash or card.  After getting that matter cleared up and the cashier confirmed our method of payment was sufficient enough to order food,  we finished our order and went outside to wait.    While waiting there were several comments from other customers complaining about how long it was taking to get their food.  Our order took about 20 minutes, however it was nice out and we were in no rush.    During our meal, I went inside to grab another beer for my husband and I.  Again, when some one finally acknowledged me I was told that my husband would need to come inside to get his beer and produce ID (this was not the case last week when I did the exact same thing).  Fine.  After I told the cashier I would go grab my husband to come inside and turned away to go get him, I hear the cashier YELL at me that it is Arizona state law to have him come inside.  Do you normally get YELLED at by a cashier?  I never have.  I absolutely appreciate following state laws what I do not appreciate is poor customer service and snarky employees.    Food is good...maybe I'll get my food to go next time and bypass some of the unprofessionalism and snide comments."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying BurgerFi for quite some time now and today we finally did and I have to say I am really disappointed about the whole experience :( I ordered the Conflicted burger, the sauce was pretty non-existent but my biggest problem was that both burgers were definitely overcooked and tough. The veggie burger was not even close to resembling a patty and was just ugh! tough/dark and just did not taste good. My husband had the  CEO and we also ordered the kids meal (which didn't come with the fries that we ordered and we didn't realize it until after we were done). All of our burgers were overcooked especially the kids 'burger' and it was very tough for a kid to eat. Overall, I'm sad to say it was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Can not wait for 5 Guys to open in Mentor. Been at BurgerFi a few times and burgers / fries not that good along with small portions and high prices. Building and location are good but overall very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great burger for a great value! You won't find a better burger for that cheap of a price! Staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. Burgers are fresh and taste great. Fries and onion rings are fantastic as well. Try the parm fries they are really good. Had the brisket burger which is excellent too. Very friendly staff place is clean. Overall excellent place."}
{"text":"I went in to the mentor location and had a very good experience mostly do to the excellent service I received at the register. Heather was very kind and prompt. And the food was very good."}
{"text":"After purging my disgusting Planet Sub dinner tried again at Burger Fi. Fast service, great food, excellent onion rings and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Will be back again soon. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Burgerfi with outstanding results!  Great customer service,  quality food, and a decorative atmosphere!   Just inhaled a Burgerfi Cheeseburger,  Kobe Beef Hot Dog, Parmesan Cheese and Herb topped French Fries,  and a drink!  Will frequent often!"}
{"text":"Food Quality is excellent. Taste is uncomparably delicious. Atmoshere is fun, appealing, and pleasant. Great place to take the family for a treat. Service is good."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and fries. 4 stars only because I wish the place was a bit cleaner. We'll be back though"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our experience here. The food was great! It seems pricey for a place that you order at a counter, but the quality of ingredients are worth it. Everything we ordered was great, and I am sure we will eat here again."}
{"text":"great burger place! Food is great, affordable and the food comes out super fast. We try to get by once a month and they never disappoint! There's never usually a wait and it's a great environment for someone with kids or without!!"}
{"text":"I go there expecting a kind of bland taste that you would expect from a healthy burger joint.  The food was very good, better than expected.  It was a little pricey and everything is separate (i.e. burger is separate from fries from drink, there are no value meals).  Other than that, very much recommended."}
{"text":"Mentor has some of the wost palces to eat in Ohio. There is practically no selection and it's all franchsies of one type or another. No family restaurants, no exotic or ethnic flavors, at least Willoughby hass Thai and Painesville has Mexicans, but what Mentor does now have in this place, the first east of the Mississippi I'm told. So, while Mentor just got a Five Guys (10 years later than everyone else) BurgerFi is what Five Guys used to be before it generally and slowly degraded. It's still good, but not great. BurgerFi is superb. The prices are above Burger King, but you get what you pay for. Wide selection of choices, a buildyourown, a limited craft beer selection, great fries, great shakes, great service, and everything else. If you've got 20 bucks to drop on a delicious savory coma-inducing lunch and desert, don't go buy 20 soft tacos or two Chipotle burritos. Come here."}
{"text":"My family and I came here not sure what to expect. We became vegetarians and have not found a restaurant with a good vegetarian burger until now. This burger was crisp and great flavor. The fries were amazing flavor and everything was extremely fresh.   Heather made the best banana caramel churro shake! We ALL loved it. She let my husband taste a local beer before ordering and she brought everything out to us very quickly.   Thank you for helping us replace our five guys experience. We finally found our burger joint!!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! The whole new Portage Crossing is a yuppie paradise but the food is pretty tasty here I'll give it that. It's nice to be able to get a beer with your burger. They have a lot of options for meatatarians as well as veggie lovers. They also have a nice (albeit hot) patio for people watching."}
{"text":"The burgerfi burger is the best burger I've had in a while! This location was very clean and the manager Michael, was a very nice and friendly hostess. I will be back when I come back to town!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious.  Sometimes the service leaves much to be desired but it always seems like young kids working there so I don't really expect much."}
{"text":"When BurgerFi first opened in Gilbert I thought I had found the holy grail of burgers. Angus beef cooked to perfection along side fresh crispy fries. Delicious! I was telling all my friends, \"ya gotta try this place!\" Sadly, the last few times I've dined, it has not been that great. To be honest, I noticed the quality begin to slide after they changed their menu. Mediocre at best. The fries were not as crispy and fresh, the meat doesn't seem to be cooked the same and the lettuce was soggy and gross. I've noticed other reviewers have edited their previous high mark reviews complaining about the same things. I really hope they turn things around because this place was the bomb when they first opened."}
{"text":"Been here several times very good food got both the burgers and the dogs excellent onion rings nice atmosphere love the outdoor patio in the nice weather. Only complaint a little pricey but I guess it's worth it or I wouldn't have been there so many times.would recommend it to everybody if you don't mind paying a little more For a burger but it's worth it.milkshakes are awesome also."}
{"text":"Pretty great. Veggie burger option was fantastic with grilled onions and mushrooms. Fries rocked with garlic aioli. Beer! Deserts! Milkshakes! We will be back. Lost a star because it's kinda pricey and that will prohibit us from going super often but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Burgers were very good but I was BLOWN away by their onion rings!  They passed my rigorous test whereby you bite into the ring and DON'T pull out the onion.  You could actually take bites.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding with a welcome the second we walked in. Lady at register was very patient and very helpful. Burgers and fries were absolutely delicious! Only 4 stars because price was a bit high."}
{"text":"Wow. Prob my new fav burger place in greater Phoenix. Burgers are so good I found it hard to believe it is a franchise element.  Plus they use natural meat.  It's as clean and well run as the best franchise restaurant. Very, very impressed. Fries are amazing. Do it and fall in love."}
{"text":"I love burger fi. It's one of our favorite places!  However: if a website, yelp, AND the door all have the same specific hours, (11-10) the workers should NOT be closing down and hour early and refusing to serve customers,such as myself.   I am VERY disappointed in the way we were treated. If otherwise give 5/5 stars. The food and service have both always been superb. -Up until now we have recommended Burger Fi to anyone and everyone. But tonight the service, or lack there-of, was atrocious."}
{"text":"Great Burger, great service! Kids loved the custard. You've got to try this place. The food is made fresh, so it takes a bit longer, but well worth the wait. We will be back."}
{"text":"Just okay. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff, but this is basically a subpar version of Five Guys, The Rail, etc. Can't say that I was impressed especially given the price."}
{"text":"I visited BurgerFi yesterday on a business lunch.  The place we'd originally intended to go to was closed so my friend suggested this place.  I'd never heard of it, but I'm a sucker for hamburgers so it took no additional effort to convince me.  We rolled up and were second in line.  The counter server, Jacy was helping the customer in front of me so this gave me time to check out the menu.  Full disclosure, I'm a burger snob.  I can't overstate this.  I've worked as a cook, even at the fine-dining level.  What I'm trying to say is that I have VERY lofty expectations for what I'm willing to consider good food.  It was finally our turn to order.  I let my friend go first, buying just a few more moments for my decision.  I selected the Conflicted Burger.  This has a meat AND a veggie patty.  There are very few examples of veggie patties that I'm willing to gag down.  I also ordered the french fries.  I had originally ordered the large fries, but she assured me the regular was enough for two people.  Anyway, Jacy and I got to chatting about food and stuff and as a result she forgot to include my little \"food is ready\" buzzer.  No problem, she said - she'll just bring the food out when it's ready.  We went to our table.  My friend had to take a phone call so he went outside.  Invariably the food showed up.  I wasn't going to wait for him, primarily because he was a guy and social graces are lost on some of us.  Plus, it was a hamburger and to hell with patience.  My first bite told me all I needed to know...this was going to be one of my new favorite hamburger spots.  It was awesome.  In fact, I need a new word to describe this hamburger.  It was \"sellyourchildrenforhamburgermoney\" good.  The french fries were just as good.  On one hand I was disappointed that I didn't get the shipping-container-ship sized basket; on the other, I'm glad Jacy suggested the regular because I would have eaten all of them and put myself into a potato-coma.    Here's where the perfect hamburger w/ fries experience got even better.  Jacy came out to see how our burger was.  Remember, she's a \"counter server\"...think \"person that takes your order and stays behind a counter\", only not like that.  I know that many people are put off by the prospect of paying fast food workers $15/hour, but this girl deserves it.  In fact, she deserves to have a franchise of her own.  She epitomizes customer care.  Well, that's all I have to say about BurgerFi except that I'm afraid I'm going to have to get another gym membership to offset the inevitable calories this place is going to represent."}
{"text":"I'll get into the review,  Our order:  Classic burgerfi double and another single Cry and fry which is fries and onion rings Vanilla shake  Oreo shake  Zero for the burgers they were very smelly and suspicious \" sorry we had to throw them\" Zero for the fries \"they were super oily and uneatable\" and onion ring \"burned so bad\"  Zero for the vanilla shake \"no flavor at all\"   One star for the Oreo shake it was really the only good thing and one star for the look of the food and shakes it was Instagram worthy pic.  I wouldn't recommend eating there unless you want to give it a chance, it might have been a bad night at the kitchen when I came or something."}
{"text":"1 word...amazing!! Burgers were delicious and service was great! Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"After eating my burger I had to remind myself that I didn't go to in n out. I'll give them an E for effort. The fries needed some Viagra. They went Limp after 2 min. I'll be waving across the street next time over at 5 girls."}
{"text":"good tasting burgers. fries are awesome as well. pretty expensive though compared to other fast-casual places like five guys, penn station, and chipotle."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding burgers! The CEO is my new favorite"}
{"text":"Very good food. Burgers were juicy and big. I added grilled onions and mushrooms and had about two bites worth ( disappointed) fries and onion rings were awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is FannTastic!! Just had a cheeseburger and fries and boy was it good. Washin' it down with a tasty root beer. Good good good! Definitely one of the better burger joints in the area."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Have not tried the custard cause I was too full from the good food. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I just paid $15 for a double cheeseburger /fries/regular drink. I am kicking myself. There is a FIVE GUYS across the street and I wish I went there.  First and LAST time I will ever eat here."}
{"text":"First time dining here with my family and we had a really good experience the burgers were good the place was clean and the French fries were awesome my husband says do not skip out on the onion rings and the burger buns are really good they are nice and sweet gotta try it it's like an upscale five guys that serves alcohol. l understand why it was packed"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant tonight. Burgers are great, especially the build your own option. Large fries are crisp and enough for 3-4 people to share. We will be back. Enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"I rank this up there with any burger joint I've been to.  All the ingredients are on point and many of them unique in style and taste.   Even the fries and onion rings aren't greasy or have that grease taste to them.  It is a bit pricey but you can taste the quality of the ingredients.  Overall it's an elevated burger joint I want to come back to try more things."}
{"text":"Will start by saying it's a little pricey here, but you are paying for a quality burger here, and in my opinion it's worth the price!  The Breakfast All Day burger is off the charts, egg, maple syrup, bacon, hash browns and fried onion, plus whatever else you may want. And I also really like the conflicted burger, it's a veggie burger and gamburger together!!!! What?!?! Yes, a veggie and hamburger together!!! And it's really a great taste! The onion rings are huge and freshly made, get a regular order because the large is ridiculously large!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd trip. The first time was ok, it was a little slow and it was their 1st day open so I could give them another shot. Bad Idea.   Burgers were bland and overcooked, fries were limp and the service sucked. I ordered a cup of cheese sauce for my fries and they gave me this pitiful little serving of cheese sauce that they charged a dollar for. When I asked about the cheese, the owner or manager or whatever he is with his horrible hair piece, told me I should've just ordered cheese fries if I wanted more sauce, he could have said something like, \"we can look into maybe getting a bigger size cup\" but he decided to lecture me about how I should order my food.   The only thing remotely redeeming about this disaster is the onion rings, I can't say anything bad about them.   After the meal, I went to the counter to ask for a to-go box and one of their employees was ordering his dinner so naturally it took 4 of their other employees to take his order and completely ignore the fact that I was standing there for about 2-3 minutes. They acted like it was an inconvenience for them to turn around and grab a box for me.   While getting ready to leave, a lady we had talked to that was also a patron not an employee asked us if we thought it was bad as well, we agreed and she and my mother went to complain or more so, let them know so they could improve, the manager lady missed the whole point, she thought they just wanted something for free. She also said if it was bad, we shouldn't have eaten it, I'm very sorry we didn't wanna wait another 20 minutes for a sub par burger and fries.   Do yourself a favor and go to Fuddruckers, Five Guys or In and Out if you want a good burger. I'll stick with Fuddruckers where they give you FREE cheese sauce for your fries if you want it. BurgerFi is a no fly zone for myself and my family!!!"}
{"text":"Add this place to the long (and getting longer by the month) line of places charging outrageous prices for average food.  A lot of people are complaining about the price - our order was $32 for two cheeseburgers (one with bacon), a combo fry/onion ring order, a plain hot dog, a 50/50 ice tea/lemonade and a Miller Lite - but I would be more willing to pay such prices if the portion size of the burger was bigger and the quality was better.   Got kids? Forget about it.  My 4 year old hot dog lover took one bite and wouldnt eat anymore of his $4 dog.  Hungry? Better double up.  The cheeseburgers were the size of (and tasted exactly like) a McDouble with lettuce and tomato.  ON THE PLUS SIDE - fries were crunchy and plentiful and the onion rings were huge and tasty with just the right amount of breading and saltiness. It seems that touting grass-fed beef and using recycled materials to build their patio benches gives them an excuse to offer average-tasting beef at inflated prices.  But how much of a carbon footprint is left when the average family has to work more to pay twice the price for the same food sold at virtually any other burger spot around? B-spot, Burger2Beer, Burgers-N-Beer, 5 Guys, Burger Nuts, Red Robin, Brindaliers, Pickles n Pints, Wright Place, Firehouse and Local Tavern all offer superior products at a lower cost with nearby locations - most using local ingredients as well.  How can BurgerFi survive once the hype has died down?"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! My hubby and I have been three times and have had a great burger each time.  They have some of the best onion rings we have ever had.  I hope they open on by the San Tan Mall next!"}
{"text":"The burgers were excellent, though pricey, and the unusual decor was pretty cool. We went there because the name was intriguing and weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place again..... quality has gone down hill, and staff is just as rude.  I have written this place off.  Way too expensive for what you get.  Yes, more likely better quality meat that McD's, but it's not worth the price for what you get and the rude staff.  Edit 07/24/15: Now that Five Guys has opened up down the street and their service is outstanding, I doubt I will ever be back to Burger Fi.  Just too expensive, poor service and the food is not that great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"go to\" place for a burger. I LOVE the truffle sauce.  The customer service is outstanding and the manager always wanders around asking if everything is to our satisfaction and usually gives us a coupon for our next visit."}
{"text":"This WAS a favorite place of mine, but sadly I will never return. We both had the CEO burgers (my fav!)  which are now thin, dry, over cooked & fell apart (even in a bun!) also the garlic parmesian fries which were tasty until I found a big black HAIR in them-eww. Not sure if there is new management or what, but I am so sad & grossed out,"}
{"text":"Since I am a self-described burger fanatic, I decided to give the new place in The Falls my attention. I stopped there the other night, parked on the street just outside, and cautiously approached the counter to order. The menu on the wall behind the counter describes their standard burgers, and provides a long list of items used to build your own. Since it was my first time there I decided to give the standard cheeseburger a chance, figuring that would let me experience exactly what BurgerFi has to offer without it being overwhelmed by all the extras.  First thing I noticed is the standard burger consists of two patties, not a good sign in my opinion. I asked how big the patties were and was told they are each a quarter pound before cooking, exactly what I feared. Most fast food joints prefer the quarter pounder because they can cook them quickly: get the customer in, get the customer out. Unfortunately that means most fast food joints, in order to sear the patty to give it a caramelized taste, cook the patties to the consistence of cardboard, which also is why I avoid all fast food joints. But I was hungry and already there so I stayed. The BurgerFi Cheeseburger comes with the typical orange American-style cheese, a potato bun, lettuce and tomato for $6.97. Being in somewhat of a hurry I passed on onion rings or fries.  After a reasonable time my order came. The first thing I noticed surprised me: the cheese, one slice on each patty, was actually melted. It wasn't just thrown onto the bun during assembly. Nice touch. And \"BURGERFI\" was burned right into the top bun. Clever. The patties were NOT overcooked and even retained a bit of juiciness. While the meat wasn't the best I've ever had, it was a definite grade above the Golden Arches and the like. And, my fault, fries and/or rings probably would have complimented the burger nicely, but would also have pushed the total to well above ten dollars, the range where one expects real gourmet food.  The young gal behind the counter, Kayla, was very polite and knowledgeable, and I got the feeling she really wanted to be helpful. However, BurgerFi is not a gourmet burger by any stretch of the definition, but they charge like they are. I would classify them as a higher-end fast food place. For the price of my burger I could have gone next door to Chipotle. And since the minimum number of stars required to review is one, and if I would ever review those fast food joints I would have to give them one star, and since BurgerFi is actually better than those other fast food joints but nowhere as good as the gourmet burgers I usually try to review, I give them two stars."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time.  I'm a vegetarian; hubby is a carnivore and we were both very happy with our burgers. Veggie burger was really tasty. Am always glad when we can find a place to eat 'fast food' that we are both happy with!"}
{"text":"Waaaaaaay overpriced. Two hot dogs (one of which was plain for a kid). A burger. Fries. $30.  I put ketchup on the breakfast burger, which I NEVER DO,  because it lacked flavor. Order was wrong. Ordered cheese fries, instead of fixing them they gave us a tablespoon of cheese for a large order. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quality burger made with fresh, quality ingredients.  The burgers may be smaller than you'd get at a Five Guys, but then again you're getting a higher quality beef with local ingredients.  The fries here are thick cut and have several different \"toppers\" that you can add on for a little extra cash.  I am a big fan of the Parmesan and herb topping.  They also have those newer pop vending machines that allow you to add various flavors to your drink of choice.  You can add peach, strawberry, grape, or cherry flavor to any pop, iced tea, or water.  I've really enjoyed mixing the peach flavor with Mello Yello or iced tea.  The service is surprisingly fast considering how busy this place usually is.  I've been there two times, both times the line was about 15-20 people deep and it only took me about 15 minutes to get to the front to place my order.  After ordering they will hand you a buzzer that will go off when your food is ready to be picked up.  The staff is very friendly and helpful about answering questions you may have with their large menu.  The price to feed a family of 4 will probably be around $30-$40 depending on what you get, but I think it's well worth the money considering you're supporting local farms and you're getting a higher end product vs. Five Guys.  The location is also great as it is right in front of World Wines, an excellent craft beer, wine, and liquor store."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It reminds me of a cleaner, cooler, version of Shake Shack with better food. The service was on point and the staff was very friendly. We tried  a variety of concretes and the overall family favorite was the red velvet. It had real pieces of red velvet cake in it!!!! The food was fabulous!! BurgerFi is my new favorite burger place."}
{"text":"Oh my GOSH - BurgerFi needs to advertise because they're absolutely awesome!! We've been here about 8 times in the past month and we love it. I've brought about 15 people here since I discovered it. The brisket burger is sublime, the veggie burger is homemade and tasty, and their beef burgers are just great. Their fries are incredible, and they have some really good beer and wine. The atmosphere is modern and contemporary but still casual, and the staff is super friendly. Hey BurgerFi - give me some coupon cards and start a loyalty program - I'll get more people in your door!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, digital menu boards are easy to read.  Staff was friendly enough.  I ordered a double cheeseburger, fries (paid an extra 77 cents for salt and vinegar \"topping\"), and a medium drink.  I paid $12.79.    The burger was small, somewhere between a real burger and a slider.  It was an ok burger, not great.  Not much flavor in the beef itself.  There were plenty of fries (total price of fries $3.74), and they were good.  But I think it's hard to distinguish yourself as a restaurant based on fries - they have to be good, but they don't make the meal.  Lots of choices on new age drink fountains.    If I visit again I'll try a hot dog.  That's probably the only reason I'd go back - to try that part of the menu.  My opinion - The Rail, FlipSide, for gourmet (B-Spot to if you're near one), and Swensons for a fast food type of burger.  I don't see how BurgerFi fits into the \"Burgerfication\" of the nation."}
{"text":"Fast food meals for restaurant prices.  Food in no way resembles the advertisements, very disappointing"}
{"text":"Burgers are good.  But nothing really outstanding to make them a whole lot better than Five Guys or other burger places.  Toppings are great. Buns are good. Burger itself...I think they forgot to season mine. The veggie burgers though are kind of awesome.  Fries are great: imagine crispier Five Guys fries. Good service, kind of loud interior. Kind of pricy.   In all, just another \"boutique burger joint\".  No real reason to return. Or even go there in the first place.    I'll stick to Brown Bag."}
{"text":"I was there the first day they were open so I am going to cut them slack on service issues because it was a PACKED house.  I made my own burger and spllt an onion ring/fry.  Onion rings are huge, 2-3 inch wide slices of onion battered/fried, a rarity and truly exceptional.  Fries are exactly the same as you would find at 5Guys.  The burger wasn't anything really special for the premium price I paid for it.  For gourmet burgers I will stick with The Rail or Flipside and for fast food, 5Guys.  I'll go back when the crowds die down to try specialty burgers/dogs."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 vegiFi burgers and 2 regular fries take out. The guy who answered the phone was friendly, but I stayed on hold for a little more than 2 minutes until he returned to take my order.   The order pick up went well. The food was hot and was still warm when we ate at home. The vegiFi burgers looked great and were tasty. I added pickles to mine. Of course the FRIES are the BEST.  They even taste good reheated in the oven. So save & reheat your leftovers!   The portions are good-sized. I was full after eating the vegiFi burger & only 1/2 my order of fries. The price is about the same as Red Robin ($19 and change for both orders). RR is my favorite for gourmet burgers, and although RR has a tastier Garden burger, BurgerFi is closer to me and I'll consider it as a near substitute for veggie burgers & fries."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Food is always good, staff is friendly, and our order is always exactly what we asked for. Their lemonade is delish as well!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Ohio!  Hope to see you soon in Columbus.  I like the size of their buns, however it is a little sweety. Service and  atmosphere are very good. I will come again every time I stop by Mentor."}
{"text":"Food was good here not sure that I'll be a regular here but the food did hit the spot! I really enjoyed the onion rings nice and crispy. I also had the twenty eight burger not bad. The staff was friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Very pricey for nothing outstanding. We do not have Shake Shack in the area but its way better than this one. Five Guys taste better and way cheaper. We spent $45 for two children and two adults at Burgerfi, but we spent only 32 at Five Guys with more food Update:  Ok i went today and I had great experience the food tasted better than last time and the service is great as usual. I gave it a second try and it was worth it so i am giving it 4 stars"}
{"text":"So we go to Burgerfi for dinner last night. Order 3 combos. The register says $38. I'm like, no that's wrong. So the guy ringing the register made a mistake. Ok it happens. The manager comes over and does some quick calculations on a piece of paper and says $30. It really more but charged you less. I'm like, whatever. I sit down and think, wait, 3 combos are $8.97 each plus tax is $28.72. So I go back up to the manager and said, I was over charged. He has no clue. Said something about the discount with and without cheese. I asked how much is a combo, he said $8.97 with or without cheese. Really, so he refunds me $2.00. What an idiot clown. Btw, the food is anyways good. Onion rings are the best. Get it together. I will be back but I will bring my calculator with me. Lol   Contact who?  Corp or the local restaurant?"}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids and eat some delicious food. My kids love their hot dogs and really don't eat hot dogs any where else. Their burgers are tasty, not greasy, don't fall apart and make you want to come back for more! And the onion rings are HUGE!!! Sometimes hard to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"This was my first and only visit here. Burgers are good, but small, similar to steak and shake quality. Very thin. I'd rather drive to mayfield and get 5 guys  do the same if you want a good burger. The fries were pretty good and plentiful. The soda machine is cool. It's really loud in there and the chairs are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place, and it was in a good burger.. Just wasn't anything special.The sides were a bit over-the-top, causing the burger to become second to the side orders...  When my meal was ready, it looked as if I ordered onion rings with a Burger on the side.An order onion rings is enough for 4"}
{"text":"My kids and I stopped in for a late lunch. This was our first visit. With only a few customers there, the staff was willing to take the time to answer my question and offer suggestions. We got 3 single cheeseburgers, a hot dog, and a bucket of fries. Our total was $30. We are fans of 5 guys and this place doesn't quite measure up. I might try again, but next tme I will get something else. The fries were good, the burger just mediocre."}
{"text":"WHAT A JOKE!!!!! probably one of the worst burgers I have ever had!!! do yourself a favor go across the street to A.J's Fine Foods and get a real grilled burger from Rick the BBQ chef at the outdoor grille!!! the burger was dry from Burger Fi!!! I am not a stranger to real 100% beef, my family was born and raised here in AZ and we OWN a Black Angus Registered Cattle Ranch, we raise pure natural grass fed beef and sell it at Farmers Markets across the valley... I called in an order and told the girl to go ahead and put it in she said OK and it would be ready in 10-15 min..... WRONG!!!! my wife was stopping by to pick it up and waited to the point she went across the Street to AJ's and picked up her salad and came back to get my sorry excuse for a burger and soggy fries, she still waited 15 minutes... VERY EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED also shocked at the price for a burger fries and a kids cup sized drink... 15.09 INSANE!!!!!! i could have gone to the KEG and got Prime Rib sliders for 13.00 and saved a few bucks....."}
{"text":"Nice new trendy looking burger joint.  One thing I noticed is there was a long line and only 1 register open despite there being 5 people behind the counter.  Food presentation is lacking and on the outside of my burgerfi cheeseburger was melted cheese.  There was no way I was eating without getting really messy.  During the chaos while ordering food they didn't suggest fries or drinks.  Needless to say I'm probably not going to be making a return visit.  The place says \"we have it together\" but the employees do not...."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today ordered the all day breakfast burger and a regular fry. Fry portion is very generous, fries were delicious my burger was fantastic as well. Manager was very friendly and so were the girls at the front counter. I will be back for sure thanks again."}
{"text":"Paid just under $13 for one which isn't bad considering the small fry is big enough to share with a hungry friend or two. The burger looked small but filled me up and tasted better than any fast food place I've been in.  They didn't have my favorite beer on tap but I did find a suitable alternative in a bottle plus they even carry wine and a handful of craft beers.   I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great food, best onion rings in the area! Very impressed.  Fresh cut fries, delicious.  Burgers are the obvious specialty and were wonderful and cooked perfectly.   Not as impressed by the hot dogs, but still pretty good. Price is fair and menu has lots to choose from.  Nice staff, clean restaurant, fast service! Inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! My first thought after receiving my burger was that it was small (in comparison to Five Guys). It was juicy and delish though so I was vety pleased.  I'd definitely ho there again.  Next time I'll try their concretes too!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers, Cajun onion rings are huge . The milk shakes are really good and service is fast , you can order ahead of time and submit order right when you get there skipping the line lol . The CEO burger is pretty tasty haven't had others yet"}
{"text":"We ordered tonight for the first time since they reopened. We enjoyed it in the past and were in the mood for burgers tonight. Service was fast and the order was right. However when we got home to eat we found the french fries SO SALTY!!!! I had to lay out paper towels and wipe them down. After that they were perfect. An inconvenience for sure but whatever we moved on. Onion rings were huge and delicious, I ordered those with no salt so no problem there. The main issue I had was with my burger. The lettuce was a joke!! A thin, wilted, tiny piece. I can forgive some wilting due to the heat of the burger but this was just gross so I pulled it off and didn't eat it. The meat wasn't what I remembered, flavor was okay, texture was just a bit off. For almost $30 for two burgers, fries and onion rings, I expect better."}
{"text":"This place is great for all you burger lovers...I love  the fact that they have fresh food...it's still a little much for me but if I feel like having a fast food burger I'm defiantly  going here the fact that there isn't hormones is huge too me...I stick to the single but I love the onion rings & yogurt too!"}
{"text":"This is our fifth visit to BurgerFi. They have consistently been good and quick. I've tried different burgers and you've enjoyed them all. It's a good deal too. It has become my new favorite burger place"}
{"text":"Make no mistake, this is fast food.  The rating is on a fast food scale.  If you're looking for burgers and fries of similar quality to The Habit Grille, then you found it.  The burgers were okay if a bit oily.  The fries were good if a bit salty.  A large fry is enough for 3-4 people.  The frozen custard was good.  The staff was friendly and service was fast (it wasn't busy).  The metal chairs were comfy enough for a quick meal."}
{"text":"A nice middle ground between fast food and sit down restaurant, with a great atmosphere. The burgers are good, nothing to remarkable. However, the concrete shakes are some of the best I've ever had in particular the Keylime concrete and I don't even particularly like Keylime pie. Their chocolate concrete with brownies and peanut butter is also amazing if you prefer chocolate desserts. This is one of my favorite places for a quick convenient place to meet up for a burger or dessert."}
{"text":"My husband and I rarely go out for dinner. We had read a review of Bugerfi in the AZ Republic regarding their veggie burger, so decided to try the place, not knowing that this was their grand opening weekend (Sept 2017). Pretty hip place... lots of silver and black... One can order at a kiosk (which you may have to know about as is behind the ordering counter)... or can order at the front. Being of the older generation, I enjoyed seeing the drink fountain being pretty high tech... and there was what looked like a space for a DJ to spin... When we went today, around 3:00pm, this place was busy with folks coming in and out. Several had orders to go. I would certainly go back again or order out.  My husband and I both had the veggie burger with the multi-grain bun. My husband deleted lettuce. My burger came with cheese, lettuce, tomato and I added pickles that were crisp and savory, and roasted onions- yum! There is some kind of sauce that they put on the burger that is outrageously delicious- could be a good dipping sauce for the fries that we had as an extra. Fries are thick-but not too thick-at first I thought a bit overdone just by looking at them, but they were perfectly hot and delicious!!! Like that they also carry craft beers.  Folks were very friendly... person who took our order assisted us through the ordering...  a young woman came by our table to ask if our table was clean (enough)... which it was- kind of thought that should have been inspected before we sat down... Also, we sat under the big fan which I will not do again as it was way too windy. I thought about asking if it could be turned down, but didn't.   Also, good music... not too loud..  Three hours later and I am still full!!! Would like to try their other burgers and also their hot dogs. Know this place should do well in Tempe being close to the university!"}
{"text":"We were welcomed warmly by the cashier, who was a very friendly guy. Sorry to say, the food was less than desirable. The burgers were small and cold. We watched our fries and onion rings sit under the lights for 10 minutes...arrived cold and over salted. No go on a return visit."}
{"text":"What a great meal wish I took a pic but my food was gone before I knew it. I have to give a BIG shout-out out to Lisa she is one of the best helpers I have ever had. Huge smile so helpful and much more hope Burger Fi knows what a great worker they have!!!! And those burger bus are the best buns!!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place!!!! Beats the place with the 5 Guys hands down and even better than the place with the Ins n Outs. Great service. Great burgers. Great fries. They have cold beer on tap, just wish they had a TV or two, or eight, to catch the games!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Cuyahoga Falls and it's about time greater things graced my hometown! I am not sure why this place hasn't received good reviews. It's a casual/fast paced burger joint. I don't know if people are expecting too much or what but I think it's better than 5 Guys Burgers.  There was an army of workers there when I went to make sure that you got your food in a timely matter.   I had a standard cheeseburger and an order of onion rings. Oh the Onion Rings- those things were just fabulous!"}
{"text":"Meh..... Nice atmosphere. Cool vibes.... However, food is not up to price point. This was intended for these 20 \"something\" hipsters that feel cool for spending too much money for overpriced food.  Anyone with half a brain will not make this a regular stop.  $1.00 for a SINGLE PIECE Of SWISS.  $1.00 for about 7 PIECES of MUSHROOM.  Wha???????? If ya'll wanna pay for this stuff. Go right ahead. Their CEO is laughing all the way to the bank. Period."}
{"text":"We love BurgerFi, Mentor.  We come most Thursday for yummy fresh, clean and tasty burger just the way we like it.  The Vegifi Green Style makes a non burger burger a hit with me.  And don't even start me talking about those fries.  Perfect."}
{"text":"The onion rings are the best thing from here and every time I get take out, everything was good except for the damn ranch that is actually mayo. I do not want a side of mayo, ever."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Los Angeles and am missing In & Out. This place will fill the void (mostly). It's actually much more like The Habit (another SoCal yummy chain). Nice fresh burgers, good fries. I like the industrial vibe, too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gross gross gross. How do people come here? We ordered an $11 burger that was supposed to be aged for 28 days etc but was inedible. The meat was bland and gamey. I couldn't eat more than two bites. The fry cry was nasty. Should've went to Innout :/"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town.  Definitely a bit pricey but still good. I suggest picking up a menu first so you know what to order."}
{"text":"Very cool upscale venue! We had a double bacon cheeseburger and a quinoa veggie burger in a lettuce bun - both were delicious! The service was great -- we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Come try BurgerFi before ASU starts back up because the line is going to be out the door soon!   Stopped by to try and there was no line, but the place was packed. They offer self-service ordering or you can step up and order with an employee. The prices are more than reasonable and the food is delicious! The only thing that would give this 5 stars is if it was faster service (I sat and waited about 15 mins for my burger and fries).   I would equate it to SmashBurger, with fresher-tasting ingredients and a wider menu (with beer and wine!!)"}
{"text":"We were newbies to BurgerFi, so its street appeal drew us inside as we drove by in Mentor, Ohio. Michael, the manager, was very personable and only added to our great lunch experience. The cheeseburgers, fries and onion rings were all delicious and definitely a go-to place for us when we're on the road. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Not very good. The burgers are small and expensive and the fries are the same type of fries you can can at a ton of mom and pop places.   The decor is mostly metal....ok except the restaurant faces west (ya know toward the sunset) and it's Arizona so the door handles are really hot. Nice planning."}
{"text":"The beef was the highest quality around, and makes a perceptible difference from other burger joints!  The veggie burger is BOSS!!! Taste is phenomenal and will forever will be my beef substitute when I'm on a Health kick!! Lol!  Nothing more to say about the fried and onion rings--they'll change your life. The atmosphere and staff are THE BEST around. I've been to all the Burger Fi's around and this location and the Mentor location both have EXCELLENT staff. Don't pass this place up!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't stay away. But maybe I should have... Hubby's burger was as good as the first, but mine was overcooked and tasteless, unless you consider burnt a taste. I should have returned it, but I was so surprised, I kept eating thinking the next bite would be good.  Considering the calorie count, it's a good thing I won't be back as quickly."}
{"text":"Was very surprised of this place I got their regular cheeseburger which is actually pretty damn good very juicy and full flavor  you could taste the beef the bun was just firm enough so I didn't get soggy with all the delicious juices now  wasn't the best I've ever had but pretty good use your checking offer and get a free small custard first time having custard it was thick and creamy way better than anything from Dairy Queen will try to make it back in their milkshakes look great too next time"}
{"text":"First of all I actually laughed out loud at how small the burger was. I'm still astonished by how small it is. I did ask if they had a mushroom burger and was told no, but they could put mushrooms on a burger. Then I read that on the secret menu the first burger listed is a mushroom burger, but that is for \"regular\" customers.  You've only been open three days. How many regular customers do you have???  The burger is two thin, over cooked patties. The bun is very fresh but has no flavor and as far as the mushrooms go, well on this tiny burger they are barely noticeable.   The onion rings are good. Nice to be able to have a beer  Kinda slow service however. No real heed to return."}
{"text":"Too much for too little....as in pushing $40 for 3 burgers, 3 soft drinks, and a shared combo of fries and onion rings.  Burgers were good but simply small (sized between a slider and a respectable burger), onion rings were just OK - giant sized batter dipped rings lacking flavor, and fries were good."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome.  Large portions. The onion rings are huge.  Burgers are huge. And stuffed.   Great music. Nice people.  Very clean.  Clean restrooms as well.  Free WiFi."}
{"text":"LOVE the burgers here. Topping selection is awesome and the milkshakes are the best around. Fries are delicious too. Very modern dining room with a nice patio (Ive never sat outside). Burgers are a bit pricier than your average fast food burger but cost is on par with Five Guys. Ill take this over 5Guys any day. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place has fallen off a cliff from the magnificent, fresh idea they used to be. They're now a disaster! Do not order more than two items. They cannot follow simple instructions like \"no cheese\" or green style. BTW...those two terms mean no cheese, and no bread. They will deliver to you a burger, on a bun...with cheese.  So I guess what I'm saying is if you want the aforementioned burger, order it with extra cheese and on a loaf of bread.  Why didn't I think if that?!?!"}
{"text":"I had their brisket burger. The meat was flavorful, though the patty was much smaller than the bun.    My husband had the regular cheese burger and my son built his own.  They both enjoyed their burgers and my son felt it was better than 5 Guys. However, we all agreed Swensons is the best.   We also ordered a bucket of fries...which was a huge portion and were nicely cooked.  Wish they had vinger for the fries.   The price was high and I do not feel the value was there but the service was awesome. Everyone was friendly and helpful....and seemes very genuine."}
{"text":"I'm alway keen to try new burger joints in town, and when I saw BurgerFi I knew I had to try it out.    Walking in the restaurant is very modern, and comfortable, the kind of place that makes you want to come back.  The menu has a good mix and there are plenty of options for customization.  My fiancee ordered a cheese burger, and I ordered the BAD (breakfast all day) burger, we each got a concrete and we split a fries and onion rings basket.    The concretes were amazing, we each got key lime pie and they tasted exactly like the original, there were even bits of crust.  These things are hands down worth your time.    My fiancee enjoyed her burger, but I was underwhelmed at the cost for \"not a bad burger\".  Neither of us were fans of the fries which were limp and undercooked, looking around at the tables everyones fries looked like this and most people ended up throwing them out.  I was hit by a case of truth in advertizing as the BAD burger was just that, bad.  The burger has a fried egg in the middle of it, and the first thing I noticed was that when the BurgerFi brand was slammed down on the corner of the bun the egg had broken open and was mostly absorbed into the carrier by the time it arrived.  The second disappointment was the maple syrup that was part of the burger, it was exclusively on the bottom bun and left it a mushy mess, last but not least the hashbrowns were uncooked shredded potatoes.  It was a mess and made me wish I had just ordered the cheese burger.    BurgerFi has ok burgers for a premium price, but amazing shakes."}
{"text":"Amazing yet again! My wife and I tried burgerfi for the first time while we were in Florida with my family and loved our experience so we were pleased to find one here in Mesa as well! I am 100% addicted to the bacon tomato jam they put on the CEO burger and could eat that thing all the time! This location did not disappoint! My burger was juicy and delicious! My wife ordered the burgerfi burger and added mushrooms. She ate hers faster than I've ever seen her eat a burger before, because it was so dang good! We love you Burgerfi, keep doing what you do!"}
{"text":"Yelp wants me to write a long winded, extensive review, but all I can say is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian the BurgerFi options were great! It is always a great time when I can get a good burger! There was little to no wait to order and the food was prepared quickly and accurately with my specific modifications. They have so many customizable french fry options that were delicious! I love the atmosphere and professionalism of the employees even though they are centrally located within a college campus."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to BurgerFi today for the first time. He got the bacon cheeseburger and I got the regular cheeseburger, with one order of fries and two fountain drinks. We felt it was a little pricey, but the burgers were great. They tasted fresh, and the fries were good as well."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed to find out the cheese is precooked in the burger, as many people are beginning to cut out dairy it leaves zero options to eat here. Before I cut out dairy I did LOVE the veggie burger. Do recommend for someone who can eat it!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get.  My son got a grilled cheese and it was tiny!  The burgers had good taste but still prefer Five Guys or The Rail.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"It used to feel like you were walking in there and you were part of a family.  I loved the customer service before.. and the Employees were amazing they had good days and bad days ofcourse... but It felt like I was part of something special when I ate there.  I wont eat here again... it doesnt have the same feel and the food isnt as good... I think they changed the beef... and how they cooked a few things.. its not the same.  :( But it was once... Atleast we still have Five Guys."}
{"text":"Not particularly impressed with Burger Fi. I got their standard double burger, added bacon and jalapeño ($7.54). For my side I went with the \"cry & fry\" option, which gives you both fries and onion rings, with parm and herbs on the fries ($6.44). I completed the order with a soda ($2.77).   Initial reaction was some sticker shock at the cost of my lunch, $18.10 in total. Okay, maybe it's REALLY good. Here's hoping...  Sadly, I it is not. The burger was okay, but just okay. It had a thin, semi-dehydrated slice of tomato on it, as well as some very wilted and old tasting iceberg lettuce -- both of which I removed. The bun is a super soft, potato style bun and was tasty enough.   That's where the good stopped.   The cry & fry left a LOT to be desired. The three massive onion rings are battered and deep fried in a manner akin to Long John Silvers, but greasier. If that's possible. The fries are the fresh cut variety, without somehow tasting terribly fresh. Perhaps the oil was off? Not sure, but as good as they looked, they did not compel me to eat more than a few.   Nail in the coffin for me is the Coke Freestyle machines. I hate drinks out of these devices, they never taste right. Plus, they have only one size soda cup, which is about the size of a sippy-cup for nearly three dollars.   In summary, i won't be coming back and would recommend others pass on Burger Fi. If you are looking for a burger fix, Five Guys does the burger and fries FAR better and for much less (plus peanuts!)."}
{"text":"Very cordial and helpful wait staff. Offered a sample of an adult beverage when it appears that's not the norm.  Love their hot dogs and adult beverage. Also the fact it's a quiet quick place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Won't be back. Soooo expensive and the burgers are so-so. The kids meal was expensive as heck! I order the regular burger because the speciality ones were so overpriced and don't even get fries with them. Only thing good is a regular fry is enormous!!!"}
{"text":"The burger was delicious, but very small for the price. The burger and bun (I had the CEO) are about the same size as a cheeseburger from McDonald's. The bun was a regular white bun that you would pick up at a grocery store. Nothing special besides the logo they somehow stamp into it. Also, there is only one drink size option, so expect to bring any with you when you leave since you'll still be thirsty. It's about 16 ounces.   If you have a peanut allergy, beware! They use peanut oil. There are a few small signs around the restaurant. These signs need to have more contrast and be larger for those of us that have these allergies.  I gave it 3 stars because the burger tasted really good, but it was WAY too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger spots in Mesa! I can count on BurgerFi to have delicious food, a clean restaurant and quick and courteous service! Love to get my burger green style (no bun) and treat myself to a side of their yummy - and huge - onion rings! If you haven't checked it out, and you appreciate a quality burger, you have got to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Burgers were great & so were the garlic fries! Cool atmosphere! Loved the Big Ass Fan!"}
{"text":"Third time's a charm! They immediately followed up with me regarding the wrong online order and offered my husband and I a free meal. We both got the vegan beyond burger with all the fixings (lettuce, tomato, jalepenos, pickles, mustard, ketchup) and everything was present and delicious. Thank you for winning us back!"}
{"text":"Delicious branded burgers i am enthralled with the spicy cajun fries will eat that again.... got to try the frozen custard sometime. A bit pricy but its good food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. Decor was nice and staff was friendly. The food was very good and so many choices. It was a little pricy but all natural and worth it. We will be back for sure. The drink selection was nice as well."}
{"text":"Pleasantly impressed.  Wasn't expecting this awesomeness. :)  Pro's:  Pretentious, good - ingredient food without the pretense. Hormone free, never frozen beef burgers with a myriad of topping choices from Hickory smoked bacon,  fried eggs, fresh produce even Hash browns and real maple syrup! The fries are cooked in peanut oil and taste just like our favorites from five guys. The Onion rings are crazy good. Get those.  Also, wagyu beef Chicago dog... enough said. :)   Atmosphere is a nod to modern industrial...love the Edison type bulbs, helicopter ceiling fan and metal chairs.   I'm not a drinker, but they seemed to have a bunch of craft beers on tap and in can/bottle.  It's still warm outside but the patio looks awesome and like a nice place to hang.  Cons: the burger sizes are smallish, but most of their custom burgers are doubles... If you're hungry get a double.  That being said they are all natural and worth the extra dough.   Understaffed FOH...If they are going to have a decent fountain menu, you need to have it separately staffed so you don't have to wait twenty minutes for custard/sundaes... the same girl who took the ten orders on a Monday night, made the ten orders on top of helping the bar. ..too much for one person.   Because the atmosphere is relaxed, they would do well to add a few large screen tvs... Might bring more clientele.  Would have been five stars if the wait hadn't taken twenty minutes for two small sundaes."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to BurgerFi last night for dinner. The place was busy, which I expected since it's new. I loved that they had a decent beer selection for the kind of \"fast-food\" style place that it is.   Best part of the meal was the French fries. I got the Parmesan and herbs topping and I loved it.   I didn't think the place was overpriced until I saw the size of the burgers. I can get the same size of burger at McDonalds for $1 or make my own larger one at home. I thought my fiancé could finish this thing in two bites. He got a create your own burger with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg and they only put the cheese on it. It's not a complicated order...however they were quick and nice about fixing it.   Overall I would really only come back here if I was craving the fries. I'd rather save my money and go to The Rail for a decent, worth-my-money burger. Or just make my own."}
{"text":"I ordered the quinoa burger or vegefi burger that everyone raved about and my husband had a beef burger off their \"secret\" menu. Side of cry and fry.   The veggie burger was good but nothing amazing. Same with their beef burgers. What really got to me was the size of the burgers. For the price I was expecting alittle larger but they came out about the size of a whopper jr and not even stacked. Their fries remind me of five guys with no seasoning.   I understand they're serving all natural pasture raised beef but it just didn't taste that way or I've just had better. For 2 burgers and 2 sides of fries and 1 drink we clocked in at about $23-24 dollars. Pricey. Mediocre taste and nothing I would crave to come back for. There are many other local spots in the area with better burgers. Too bad, I wanted to like the place!  Great interior decor though!"}
{"text":"I recently stopped working at this location. Firstly, the dishes are disgusting. They are always covered in food particles and feel oily to the touch. The drying rack for the dishes is covered in a nasty, smelly, yellow, waxy resdue. The dishes are always put away wet, Which causes bacteria build up and a horrible smell. They have us use those dishes anyway. My old boss had me pan up brown, smelly (obviously expired) Angus. He also keeps  old onion rings and re-breads them. I have gotten sick from this food several times while I had been working there. Other than, that it is really good food. I doubt other locations have this problem."}
{"text":"Great location across from Dana Park (Val Vista and US 60) in Mesa.  Attended soft opening tonight for family, friends and close associates This isn't just another burger joint......all natural burgers from ground brisket to ground chuck; Wagyu Kobe hot dogs served up Chicago style, Texas style or however you want them; house cut fries and fresh onion rings with salt or vinegar or parmesan or cheese or chili.....you see where I'm going with this; concretes, sodas, fresh strawberry lemonade and various alcoholic beverages. All in all a great local joint that is fresh, fast and delicious.  Wave goodbye to Five (Guys) and get BurgerFi'd  Food = 4.0 Service = 4.5 Ambience = 3.5 Overall = 4.0"}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get and the quality, $8 for a double cheeseburger that isn't anything special. Customer service is good but they try too hard, if you just want a regular normal burger come here"}
{"text":"The burgers have a good char on them.  French fries were kind of soggy for 5+ not a good deal.  No flavor.  Needed salt.  Would I return? Probably not. Chairs were really noisy.  Our waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite burger place! The quality of the meat is amazing, the fries are seasoned and delicious, and the onion rings are the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend going between 2pm and 5 pm Monday- Friday. That's when they have their happy hour deal! For $10 you get an amazing burger, a fry and onion ring combo, and a drink. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers for sure.  Would have received 5 stars except that I ordered online using the app.  All went smoothly and it said my order would be ready in 12 minutes.  It took me 15 minutes to get there.  Not a sole in the restaurant and I asked about my order at the counter.  They looked at me with blank expressions then said they haven't started it.  Whatever....the burgers were amazing."}
{"text":"hands down one of the best burgers I've had in a long time and the fries ...to die for .... I'm coming again next week"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! CEO burger(switch swiss for cheddar) was absolutely AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite burger place. The burgers are always fresh. I really like onion rings and hubby likes fries. I love the cry-Fry on the menu. (You get both).The special truffle and aioli sauces are amazing and worth the extra cost. I get it in the side and then you can use it anyway you desire. This place is clean and fast and really seem to care about their customers. Keep up the good work!  So we tried this place after the re-launch. We miss the friendly customer service. Every worked had this sad face going on. Cry-fry was much better before and fries were a smaller portion this time. Hubby said last night\" honey not that impressed with burger-fi. I don't think we will back anytime soon especially for the price you pay. Hope this helps to improve for your success."}
{"text":"I've been back a few times since my first review.  The \"newness\" has worn off a little so it's not as crazy busy as it was a little over a year ago.  While I haven't phoned in an order again to see how that process is, we have instead eaten at the restaurant.  The service is good and personally I think the burgers are great.  I commented on the size of the burger in my initial review but for whatever reason it hasn't bothered me since.  Usually get a double cheeseburger with bacon and egg on it.  Very good!  Maybe it's the amount of fries that has offset any concern I had with the size of the burger.  You get a lot of fries and they're great too!  Downside: still a bit expensive for a burger and fries. Obviously that hasn't stopped us."}
{"text":"Ehh? Service friendly and onion rings were very good. The burger was not the best I have had by a long shot. It was dry and the lettuce looked old. The gimmick here is the Burgerfi brand on the bun. Atmosphere is nice. They do have a nice variety of burgers and dogs. Probably 50/50 as to whether we go back. We usually give places a second chance. Saw them on the morning news yesterday and had higher expectations for an experience than received."}
{"text":"2nd trip 9/11/15. 8:45pm. The restauraunt was busy, loaded with kids. I think there was a kids birthday being celebrated. I believe order taker was a bit on the dishonest side. I ordered burgers to go, she increased it to include cheese without asking. I caught the price mistake immediately, she said it was no problem to correct, then charged me the proper amount, I paid, etc. She never apologized but looked uncomfortable at being caught, face to face.  The other reason why I think it was dishonesty versus making a mistake on the ordering terminal is after placing my order I sat at table closest to the register and listened to her handle all the customers that followed me. In every case she tried to upsell them into adding cheese, fries, or desert and drinks if they didn't order any. Every customer gets a lengthy upsell, which is the primary job of the person taking orders. I believe in my case, she assumed I was too old to notice the subtle price increase of a dollar each burger. I don't know what the employee incentive is but it's obvious there is motivation to upsell every customer, which totally explains her response to being caught. By effectively upselling at the register they can earn enough extra cash to pay for some of the employees on each shift. I don't believe for one second that she accidentally touched the wrong spot on the order screen, this was an attempted theft.  Got home with our carry-out order to find that all three burgers got cheese anyway. Two of them went in the trash, the third one went to our neighbors dog.  He loves cheese. Sorry, we can't eat cheese, it's a digestive problem we have with some kinds of cheese. Part of the problem is, we drive 10 miles round-trip to get there so I doubt we'll ever go back. The whole trust thing is gone now. Normally I never go back with a restaurant issue like this because with some restaurants comp'd food has a habit of falling on the floor on it's way to the plate. Never send food back to the kitchen at any restaurant.  Like I said in my previous review, if you do not want cheese on your burgers you really need to specifically state that when ordering, \"I don't want cheese\" because some of their dishonest cashiers will add it anyway, which adds a buck or more each.  2/09/16 My GF wanted to go back, so we did. This time we had everything opened at the counter to check for errors. Despite questionable service, it's still a decent hamburger. Regular burger is $5.97, fries $3.27, small drink $2.77  Their fries are miss-able and generally over-cooked."}
{"text":"Had high hopes but left a bit disappointed.   I got the build your own single patty wrapped in lettuce and added grilled onion.  They literally put an entire head of lettuce around the burger which had no taste.  Hubby got the breakfast all day burger and he said it wasn't that great.  He also wanted to try the kobe beef new York style hot dog and he only ate 2 bites.  Kraut was soggy with no taste.  Their drinks are super small for almost $3.  We split a regular fry which was the only thing that got this place 2 stars.  In total we spent $26 which 5 guys is much better.  Even with the coupons they gave us I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious!! Definitely worth stopping by! The staff was extremely friendly! Honestly the best burger place I've ate at and the onion rings are definitely worth it super fresh and the batter was so tasty! Great food, great service, good prices! Couldn't ask for more! Definitely stopping by again!"}
{"text":"While the food is ok, it is not nearly worth the price. I paid $16 for a regular burger and a regular fry and a standard fountain drink. For the same price, I could have gotten two burritos at chipotle. The fries were burnt and the pop machine was flat.   The only reason to go here is for the burger. If you don't get anything else there you are doing yourself a favor.   Stay away from the fries, drinks, and ice cream."}
{"text":"First time here. For a burger and fries it was $10. Seems kinda pricy. The burger wasn't even that big. The burger was good even if they did leave off the onion ring which was a $1 extra. They did bring it by later. :( Also, some of the fries were burnt. Wasn't the greatest experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it's a no. The place itself inside is pretty nice, clean, and spacious. We ate outside where it was a little dirty.  I spent about $9 on a small cheeseburger meal that had consisted of an old piece of tomato and some lettuce. It also came with fries, one huge weird looking onion ring, and sippy cup size drink. (I had to get about 6282736383 refills)   The burger was just \"eh\" nothing stood out about it. In n out burgers are way better! The fries here though were the only things that I liked! They tasted fresh!! All in all, I'm gonna skip this place...."}
{"text":"We specifically came here for their Beyond burgers and we weren't disappointed with how delicious they taste if you're not familiar with beyond burgers they are 100% vegan burger patties that taste nearly identical to their meat counterparts. The burgers were delicious and had a very consistent and smoky flavor similar to that of a whopper. I'm looking forward to eating here again. Their fries were exceptionally good. What made unique was their specialty aioli mayonnaise garlic sauce which I highly recommend. The prices were reasonable for a vegan burger when you consider some of their competition offering the same burgers for 50 to 75% more. Beautiful and modern ambiance and a cool and chill place to hang out. Their patio was very comfortable with plenty of seating and tables facing a street view. The burgers come with a variety of toppings that you can get which include either raw or grilled onions, jalapeños, relish, pickles, lettuce. There are additional toppings that you can get that you will need to pay for. Their barbecue sauce is extra delicious as well, and you can get that as a free topping. The staff was also very personable and nice, overall very clean interior and patio and a great place to stop by."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in here for lunch a few weeks ago, and I really enjoyed it! The ordering process confused me for a second because they have kiosks and then two people manning a counter; I wasn't sure which I was supposed to use.  I ended up ordering from the person at the register. I had already heard the veggie burger was good, from a vegan so I took that with a grain of salt and I asked the cashier about it. She raved about it and described how they make it in house using lentils and other ingredients I can't recall. So, I got it and they were both right! I loved the texture and flavor. I might consider getting the conflicted next time because I want to try the regular patty, but I'm not sure I can give up the veggie one! You can add additional toppings for no additional cost, so I added grilled onions at the suggestion of my cashier and they were great as well!  Also, they have the Freestyle machines so I can load up on Peach Sprite Zero (WHY has this not made it into a can yet??). All in all, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came in this evening to finish my review. The first thing I noticed when I came in the sliding doors was being greeted by a delicious smoky aroma of beef on a grill followed by smiles and hellos from employees. The cashier (you can also order from a computer if you prefer (millenials smh) but i prefer ordering from a human) kindly offered me a small menu that might be easier to look at then the board. The lady misheard my name I discovered when my buzzer went off and I went to get my order and they said here's your order Nathan. Nathan is a decent name though so I wasn't offended.   After carefully examining my choices I decided to stay with basics for my first trip in. I got a cheeseburger, fries, and an oreo custard shake. I just prefer a tiny small fries and when I asked was told the smallest they had was regular and that that was the kid size so I got that. The regular was fairly large (see photo) I would have liked a smaller portion size for fries myself. The fries were cut fairly thick and some still and bits of potato skin still on them. While they weren't my personal favorite fries, there are lots of people who would like them and they were well seasoned with a coarse salt. For ketchup they have the paper cups like most places but they are wider and more shallow which allowed you to dip upwards of 10 fries in the cup at a time and shove them down your throat.   They press the name burgerfi into the bun of the burger which was a nice touch. Presumably they do so with witchcraft or with n iron with their name written written in reverse on it. My burger had a good flavor with nice cheddar and a nice soft bun to cradle all the ingredients in.    During my meal an employee came around with a small sample of their red velvet concrete which was vanilla frozen custard with nice moist red velvet cake chunks mixed in. It was really quite good. I would definitely recommend that and will likely come to get it for a nice Sunday evening treat in the future. My orem concrete shake was yummy and had rainbow sprinkles on top which is always fun. Importantly $1 from each shake goes to St. Jude Children's Hospital according to a sign in thete. That's an amazing cause I can get behind and believe. They may have lost a star on fries for me but definitely gained one for supporting a great cause I believe in.   The pricing is similar to Shack Shack with kind of a similar atmosphere and menu but a little different too, and I think there is room for both. The decor has contrasting wood and metallic elements with lime green accents.   This is a new business and owners and employees were all very nice and gracious and hooked me up with a little grand opening swag so I am going to be gracious and give them 5 stars today. Wish them luck with their venture and I'll be back to see how they do."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times and I am done. Obviously I have given it a fair shake. Burgers are nothing special so I tried the chicken today. Once again disappointed. My wife likes it a little more then me so that's why I've gone back but she agrees that there's better out there especially for the price. I'll drive a little farther and go to 5 guys from now on. The only thing good here is the onion rings."}
{"text":"My son and I tried BurgerFi a couple weeks ago and loved it.  The onion rings are to die for and I don't even like onions!  The burger is very tasty and even filled up my teenage son and that's saying a lot.  We just went back again this weekend and was it was still fantastic.  This time I had ordered both fries and onion rings and there was so much we had to take some home.  I just wish it wasn't so far from my home.. either way it's worth the drive when we head out to Mentor."}
{"text":"They never get my order right. I've gone there 3 times now, every time telling the cashier \"chicken apple hotdog\" with them ringing up \"Chicago dog\" unknown to me as your initial receipt doesn't say what you ordered. I then receive the hotdog with the server just grabbing the remote and walking away, not checking to make sure it's OK as he did with many other people at tables around me. The hotdog I received was the Chicago dog, which was not what I originally ordered. My receipt also says \"Chicago dog\" so I can't return it. This exact scene has now happened 3 consecutive times. I am no longer going back in hopes something has changed. I'm officially done with this place."}
{"text":"Very Underwhelming. I got the Burgerfi burger with onion rings and a drink. Cost about 12 bucks. The only item that tasted as expected was the fountain drink. The onion rings were too greasy, there was literally a puddle of oil in the tray. The burger well, I could have gotten a better tasting and satisfying burger at any of the surrounding fast food stops, Jack in the box, Whataburger, Burger King etc. They did nothing to improve the taste of the burger to merit the price. The bun was larger than the patty. The Patty was thin, not juicy at all. So, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here. The onion rings are amazing.  The service is great.  Lots of burger places out there but this place does it right"}
{"text":"We are big fans of the BurgerFi in Mesa and go there regularly. We went to the this location tonight because we were in the area but were surprisingly disappointed. Compared to the Mesa location, the burgers and the onion rings here were very bland and the burgers were so pink inside that we had to send them all back and ask for them \"well-done\" to get them cooked to the same color as the ones in Mesa are normally. Also, I get that this is in a college area and the crowd and vibe are different than in Mesa but, when we waked in, the song that was playing (loudly) was full of uncensored profanity. I don't usually care but I wasn't expecting it at a burger joint and was pretty uncomfortable having my 7 year old there."}
{"text":"First time here I had their quinoa burger, fries, and ice cream it was really really good! I would definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"We love BurgerFi! I go often to get a great burger for a great price. Always clean and plenty of seating. We have brought many friends there who love it too. Great option for people that prefer a cleaner burger."}
{"text":"The picture shown is a lie!  Your burger will not look like that!  When I walked in, it was full of baseball leagues, that should have been a sign.  The staff looked confused and about 6 people asked me if I had questions about the menu, which I did!  I asked if there are alternative burgers aside from beef or quinoa?  She said she didn't know.  Well, back to the confusing menu.  I decided to get a burger with cheddar cheese, grilled onion, burger-fi sauce, and mustard.  I assumed it would come with at least lettuce and tomato, but it didn't!!!  So, my burger was smaller than a cheeseburger from McD's, slopped over with some Kraft single looking cheese, and I honestly could not differentiate between the burger and the grilled onions because it was slopped on there.  Keep in mind, there was no burge-fi sauce on it either and when I asked for it, the one at the counter looked confused!  I also ordered a draft beer, she went to pour it and it was out... she said they were out of it!  So, I said, can you change the keg and she looked at me like I was talking another language.  So then she handed me a bottle of beer and asked if I would like this instead.  THEN, I ordered the fries that were described as parmesan fries with garlic aioli.  THEY WERE NOT!  They were cold, limp, and the cheese had no flavor, and the aioli was gross mayo with no garlic to it.  I specifically tasted each element individually and there was no flavor, the ingredients were poor quality, and the service was poor.  Sorry I am not 8 and a member of the MUSTANGS baseball :/ but this food was not good."}
{"text":"My first trip to BurgerFi during a visit to the Cleveland area, upon walking in the place is super clean and modern. Polished cement floors and warm wood tables. Alec at the register was super helpful with his suggestions. My friend and I both placed our orders...while we were waiting Dominque yelled at, almost berated, one of the line cooks. It was loud enough that we were both  in shock and hadn't we just paid we both would have left. Despite her horrendous management style our food was delicious. She seriously needs some sensitivity training and mentoring."}
{"text":"It was my first time having burger fi and I'm a burger fanatic and just loved it. The food came out fast and fresh! I had the conflicted which is one veggie patty and a beef patty. The veggie patty was AWESOME. The fries were thick, fresh and topped with herb, parm, and aoli. Fries were comparable to five guys and the burger was way better than the rail but comparable to flip side but a few bucks cheaper! This is definitely one of my new favorite places to get a nice burger. Lastly, the manager was so so so kind and welcoming. He was one of the nicest people I've encountered in a restaurant! Very pleased for my money!"}
{"text":"Good greasy burger joint. Industrial design in dining area means relaxed atmosphere. The burger is good - not $7 good but good. Great fries and shakes. 1 fry will feed 2+ adults. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This is my second visit for a good fast food burger.  On my first visit I got the breakfast burger which was good but a bit too much food for me.  This time I made my own swiss, onion, and mushroom burger and it was awesome!  And the create your own drink dispensers bring the kid out in me and I tried 4 different combinations.  I would pass on the parmesan and herb topping for fries, it didn't do much for them.  Also beware if they have their giant blade fan on, we had to anchor all our items down so they wouldn't blow away."}
{"text":"I'm actually quite surprised by the lukewarm reviews. I went to Burgerfi on a whim when I was shopping at Pet Supplies Plus one Saturday afternoon.  I order a burger with plenty of toppings, onion rings, and fries to go. The wait was a little on the lengthy side, but it was during the lunch rush, so I didn't think much of it. The burger reminded me of Five Guys, but I actually liked it quite a bit more. In fact, I went to Five Guys less than a week later for comparison, and confirmed that I did prefer the Burgerfi burger. Some other reviewer called it small, but I'd disagree. My fiance and I each had a burger, then barely touched our fries and onion rings.  The fries were pretty disappointing, largely because there was little to no seasoning on them. There's plenty of interesting toppings you can get on them, but we just got regular ol' fries, and the lack of salt was severe. On the other hand, the onion rings are HUGE and nothing short of divine. I absolutely loved the onion rings. I'd agree that the place is on the pricey side, but I think it's similarly priced and of similar quality to Five Guys.  If you like old fashioned American burgers and some really delightful onion rings, I think Burgerfi is absolutely worth a try."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait. Spend your money at Wendy's. The burger tasted like a rip off of Wendy's that was half the size. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food first time going here my experience was awesome! The people were great and the environment was just eclectic"}
{"text":"It's one of those places that you walk up to on a Sunday evening and can tell something is a little off. You open the door and your ears are flooded with very loud thumping music even though the place is empty. The energy just didn't match the stimulus. I sat outside, it's loud out there too because of road noise.   It's one of those places that asks you if you've been there before. You know, because ordering off a menu is a unique thing and you might need some extra help. A few exchanges of smiles with the register lets you know they know it's cheesy too. But when you are trying to create a brand you have to do what you have to do. More about branding later.   So I ordered the cheese Burger Fi Cheeseburger (yup they have their own name for that too), onion rings (because a friend said they are awesome) and a nice summer beer (maybe 8 different pulls to pick from). Grand total, $15.81 of which $3.47 was the beer.   So how was it? Presentation was pretty good (see photo). The burger was small (about size of the tomato slice), branded (yes literally branded with the brand by a branding iron), the onion rings were huge (each one bigger than the burger), the beer cold. The burger tasted really good and very cheesy. The onion rings were too big, hard to eat so big and you know giant onions don't taste as good and are very chewy compared to normal sized onions.   I would comment more on service but it's kinda like a fast food place in that regard. Go get your napkins, catsup, drinks and straws yourself.  Welp, I had to try it but I won't be back unless I'm with someone who really really wants to come here. Good news is Aladdin's Eatery is across the street."}
{"text":"Great meal!  The people who gave this place bad reviews, probably eat at McDonalds and give them great reviews. I like Smash Burger, Burger Fi is better!  All grass few beef, fries taste like 5 guys, but are not greasy. The single patties are thin, but taste great. Go back to Mickey D's haters."}
{"text":"Updating my review. Staff has steadily gone down hill. We can't get a correct order, a clean table, or apparently anyone who has more than a few active brain cells left. We've  come at different times, different days.....to no avail. Very sad. I guess it's  Zinburger for us from now on. The food WAS great..."}
{"text":"Healthy items on this menu along with -burgers, turkey patties and some fun side dishes. The staff is hit or miss. I have had great staff that clearly explained menu items. Food was on point 2 of the 3 visits Then Another visit we had a person that completely confused our order. Food was overcooked."}
{"text":"VERY good food; large portions. Trendy, funky atmosphere. Check out the maker of the gigantic ceiling fan there (fan is manufactured by a uniquely named company). A bit pricey but that's ok every now and then."}
{"text":"All I can say here is this place meets expectations. There is nothing about the food or the service that particularly stands out good or bad. The brand mark on the bun is a cute gimic... but the food is a tad bit pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"So we made the trek from Queen creek to burgerfi, d3f not worth the drive and will stick to smash burger.  Inside was nice and clean staff was friendly  Ordered our food was kind of shocked by the price I paid for 2 adults and 2 kids but figured it mush be good for the price, since you get what you pay for.  Burgers first thought when they came out was, did they mess up our order and ring in kids burger. The size of the burger was that of a McDonald's burger, bacon did not taste fresh at all and like it was out of a bacon bits can but in strips.   Temperature of our burgers where a bit warmer then room temp. The bun was good normally you get some flaky stale bun this was the exact opposite and surprisingly great.  Fry & Cry is larger then you think comes with 3 onion rings that are huge if you like grease go for the rings, the fries are the best hands down that I have had yet.  Drinks kids and regular drinks are the same size as a red solo cup needs to be a fix to this unless you like getting  up to refill your drink several times.   Price we spent 49 and some change, will definitely stick to smash burger where we spend about 35 and get a bigger patty."}
{"text":"I just went there to try for the first time. I ordered Burger(no tomatoes, no onions) w/bacon and reg fries. The burger was alright but the put a slice of tomato w/o the bacon which I was charged $1.57 good luck."}
{"text":"Always the same so you know it is always the same. The burgers are so yummy but boy the onion rings rock!  If you ever find yourself driving by one stop in and check them out.... i could have hit a five but size and price are out of line a little and the wait but i guess it is better then pre cooked pattie places...."}
{"text":"The manager gave me a gift card for my traumatic experience. I appreciate that. The shakes are still delicious and although the burgers are small, it was made just right. This time my fries were perfect. That's all folks!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see that the reviews aren't better for this cute, quaint burger spot. My personal favorite thing about Burgerfi is the food is pretty natural. The service is usually alright. You seat yourself after ordering and there is plenty of room. I've never had anything from them I didn't find delicious. It's worth a go!"}
{"text":"Burger was tasty but not big.  The fries and onion rings were big and very good.  Nice selection of beer,  a little prcey but it was good quality overall  and i will go again."}
{"text":"Veggie burger was one of the best. My husband had the burgerfi burger and thought it was pretty good. They prepare the food fresh and are a bit pricey for a burger joint but worth it. The onion rings are huge and the French fries were good. Banana shake was okay. Overall burgerfi is worth a try."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices. Staff may be new because they were pretty slow. They were nice though."}
{"text":"I first discovered BurgerFi in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. I was there for a week and we ate there 3 times! So excited when I found out about this one in Mesa. After reading most of the reviews here, I would like to clarify a couple of things. Being a former restaurant owner and a foodie, I love to talk shop when in a restaurant. I spent a few minutes talking to the manager in Ft. Lauderdale. All of the beef is FREE RANGE, GRASS FED, AND HORMONE FREE. This is so important in today's world. He even printed out the page about the ranch where the beef comes from and brought it over to our table while we were eating. Super nice of him! The buns are brioche (Definition of Brioche, \" a pastry of French origin that is akin to a highly enriched bread, and whose high egg and butter content give it a rich and tender crumb\"). I wish more people understood that you get what you pay for. I think for the quality, the freshness and the flavor of all their food, the price is fair. I am willing to pay extra for those things! And, I L0VE the fries (I am a purest. I like plain ole fries!) and the milkshakes...okay, I love it all! Of all the new burger chains out there, this is my favorite."}
{"text":"Not even hearing anything about BURGERFI, I took a chance and ordered takeout. I got the double cheeseburger and it was very good. The key lime concrete is delicious. The only regret is that I should've requested the fries to be well done when I did my online order because they were a little too limp for my preference. AND I love that I can request non-salted fries! I like to salt on my own. I'm just an independent woman that way."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch or dinner to grab a good burger in Mentor. The Parmesan fries are incredible and you have to try the onion rings too. If usually pretty busy so we always use the Wi-Fi option and order ahead and pick it up for lunch for the whole office. Even though it's winter now we love to eat there in the summer on the patio just a great spot"}
{"text":"Heard from a few friends about this place and decided to see what all the fuss was about. Very glad I did!   This place has a very cool atmosphere! Energizing music, cool lighting, recycled furniture (ask the assistant manager girl about the furniture- it turns out just about every fixture they have has a story, and she lights up when she tells you about it. So refreshing to see someone this passionate!).   The TV menu boards are cool, but they're kind of small so it may be hard to read for some. Half a star off for that. They have to-go menus conveniently placed about though. It took some time for me to settle on what I wanted. The cashier was patient with me and pointed out their \"secret\" menu inside the to-go menu. It's not all that secret, just hidden I guess.   While I was still looking over the menu, someone from their kitchen yelled out \"WELCOME TO BURGERFI!\" which was followed by the rest of the kitchen yelling \"ALL NATURAL!\" in unison. Truth be told, I didn't know what they said at first and had to have the cashier repeat it for me. Regardless, it was amusing and put a smile on my face. Some kids at a table nearby really seemed to like it as well.   I couldn't decide whether I wanted their Quinoa veggie burger or their \"all natural\" beef burger, so I settled on what's called their Half and Half stack from the secret menu. That's right- a beef patty topped with a quinoa veggie patty. Oh the beautiful gluttony! Decided to go with the urban fries at the suggestion of the cashier, and a fountain drink from one of those techno coke machines. Props to the cashier girl for a successful up-sell. I was given a pager and told my order should be ready in 6-8 minutes.   It took that full 8 minutes to get my order, which wasn't a bother to me since they start your order from scratch. If you have three or more people on your order I would expect a slightly longer wait. After all, if you want fast food you could go somewhere where they have everything pre-made and sitting under heat lamps- yuck!   So now for the good news--- the food was amazing! The half and half was better than I honestly expected it to be. Crispy, fresh tasting veggie patty, and a juicy flavorful beef patty. Just wow. The urban fries (parmesan and herbs with garlic sauce on top) were cooked crisp and tasted fresh. I was mid-meal when the assistant manager did her round through the dining room, and when she stopped at my table I asked about the history of the company and the furniture. She was informative and seemed happy to be there, and seemed to genuinely want to know what I thought. Always a positive in my book when the management cares to know what customers think. So I told her the menu boards were small and that I think sweet potato fries would be a winning idea. She said she agreed and would pass that along to the owners. Hopefully she does!   All in all I finished feeling stuffed and happy and I really just wish I had left room for custard! I will definitely be back. I enjoyed the cool atmosphere, the service was great, and the food was outstanding. BurgerFi is now officially in my rotation!"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB. I asked my son what he would rate he his place and he said, \"Ten Stars!\". I explained to him, it's only out of five, haha. But, you get the point that my son loves this place. They are kind of pricy, but it's good food. So, you get what you pay for it. We were here on Friday for lunch and my son wanted to come back today (Monday) for lunch again. We're back here! The burgers tasted fresh! I got bacon on my burger and the bacon was crispy and not soggy, made me happy. We shared an order of cry+fry and it was a good mixture to have both especially when we couldn't commit to one or the other. We love this place and we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries were delicious  Fries are really good - get a bucket for carry out   Onion rings were THICK and real onions a little greasy - I ate the last ring that was a little cold sitting in the grease from all the rest and Stomachache city - where are the tums  The have a Coke Freestyle - which was invented by Dean Kamen the inventor of the Segway to get Coca Cola to distribute his water purification system all over the world - cool  Dean Kamen should invent plates for BurgerFi to sell their hamburgers on  One thing - did I mention there are no plates  Eat off paper napkins - oolala"}
{"text":"I love pretty close to this location and its one of the burger places I prefer over many other restaurants. Because of their wide range menu, i usually have a hard time choosing what to get cause I usually get something different everytime, only thing is what. I usually like to keep it simple and get a cheese burger, but their breakfast burger with a fried egg on top is amazing. I like these style of burgers every now and then and the urban fries and chili cheese fries are a must get! Regular sizes are kinda big, can feed 2-3 people honestly. I'm also pretty happy that they serve wine and crafted beers here to enjoy. Definitely a recommended spot!"}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious! The onion ring batter is tasty. The decor is really modern. Would definitely recommend and come again."}
{"text":"The best tasting burgers around.  I love this place.  Enjoy a beer while you wait for your food.  Clean place.  Friendly staff.  Me and my son love the custard.  And the veggie burger was a surprise!  It was actually really full of flavor and filling.  The manager working Mike was really helpful and friendly.  Best place in AZ by far if you want a high quality burger and beer experience."}
{"text":"Seriously rediculously THE BEST fries ever. My son and I were in the area and stopped in for the first time. I've drove by this place a bunch of times- but never stopped before. I wasn't expecting much because I just wasn't sure, but we were both blown away. Our burgers were amazing. Juicy, flavorful- shocked to hear other people say they thought they were small- we thought the exact opposite. I thought they were very generous in size. Cooked to perfection. Fries as I said were best ever. Next time I'll try the onion rings as I'm a ring fanatic. Definitely will stop I'm again!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this but was very quickly disappointed..I ordered the vegefi burger, fries and a coke. First thing I didn't receive my coke at all which i paid for and then I asked for NO cheese and they put cheese on my burger and I'm lactose intolerant so now I can't even eat my burger, I wanted lettuce and tomato and they decided to take it out of the burger even though I didn't request that at all? and I tried to chase down the delivery driver to get my coke and he just completely ignored me waving him down..seriously what a joke! So to sum it up I order a burger, fries and coke and paid for all of them and the only thing I can eat now are the fries"}
{"text":"Well, this place is a must try!!  I was lucky to try a bit of everything during a Yelp event a while ago and since then been wanting to return and eat more! :) So I picked a random Monday afternoon for a feast.   There are many cool things about this spot: the ambiance is cool, soundtrack is awesome, tv always playing sports, nice and friendly employees and both times I came here the manager - or owner, in not sure - was working hard behind the kitchen counter.  Their burgers are SO good. Try the CEO if you enjoy a bit of savory flavor on your burger or just go with the regular bacon cheeseburger and you won't be disappointed. The bun is so soft and even though the burger is huge, you won't feel like you're about to explode after finishing it.  Fries. Ah their fries! Yes and yes! Make sure you add the \"urban style\" sauce and thank me later. Great fresh cut fries!!!  Also, their custard. Their custar is something out of this world... the texture... it's the texture. So much goodness!  Prices are fair, great ambiance, great staff, large parking, great music. What else do you need from a burger place?"}
{"text":"I ordered BurgerFi through Uber Eats and was pleasantly surprised.  The burgers were cooked perfectly and featured tasty additions.  The fries were also delicious, but I was bummed that the restaurant forgot to add toppings to the urban fries that were ordered."}
{"text":"I really like BurgerFi, but I am not a fan of Five Guys. If you want grease don't go to BurgerFi as you will not find it. My husband and I are very conscious of what type of meats we eat, grass fed, antibiotic free, etc. this place fits the bill for us. The burgers are on the smaller size (again not Five Guys) but definitely enough food (we also split a small fry with the herb seasoning). I have tried the quinoa burger as well, which is not vegan by the way but was tasty. My husband got a hot dog on one visit and he really enjoyed it. The only feedback I have is on the Black and White, basically a chocolate milkshake. I lived on the East Coast for 3 years and to this day there is no better Black and White than at Jake's, sorry BurgerFi. We will definitely be back for more burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, both angus & veggie. The service was good and they have craft beer on tap.  Oh - and the fries...delicious.  If you're looking for another burger joint, I would definitely give BurgerFi a try."}
{"text":"Delicous burger! Cooked exactly as ordered. Girl taking order had s hard time with English, but we worked through it. Defintely recommend as s burger treat. A little on the pricey side is the only downfall."}
{"text":"I tried for the 1st time today - WOW!  Built my own burger and ordered a large fries to share with a friend.  Folks, the large fries can easily feed a family of 4!!!  Prices are steep but food is totally worth it!  My burger was tasty and not greasy and gross like Five Guys.  One onion ring looks like it could be a belt for an NFL linebacker - no joke!  Various hotdogs - next time I am trying the Chicken apple!  Bonus...They serve beer, wine, mixed drink and custard!  Clean, friendly fast and AWESOME food....coming back fo'sho!"}
{"text":"They make really tasty burgers here I tried it today for the first time. I ordered the create your own with fried egg, grilled onions,  lettuce and tomato, everything including the egg was cooked perfectly,  York was running down my burger! Bye Bye Johnny Rockets or Zinburger! they are also cheaper than the other Burger joints."}
{"text":"Ok. I gave this place 3 stars because I have to review this place as a whole.  Based on food and customer service this place was great. Burger was fresh and hot. The frys were cut fresh and I got the Cajun seasoning which was very good. I didn't have the onion ring but I did see other with them and they looked very tasty. So if this was a food only review 5 star all day long. However. This place is rediculous expensive. I stayed and paid the price only because I didn't have time to go some were else during my lunch break. I know they probably don't care much that their expensive because as long as ppl are willing to pay why lower prices. But I got a double bacon burger.  A fry and a soda. Which is just a small cup and it was almost $16 bucks. That's pretty dang expensive. I would go again based on the food but I won't go again because of the price."}
{"text":"The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is that they are a bit pricey.  Burgerfi has the best veggie burgers ive had a in a long time, and their fries are amazing.  Also their custard is awesome.  When you go try the strawberry lemonade it too is great.  If they cut their price just a bit I would go regularly."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan nor am I a vegetarian so I went with the Conflicted Burger with a hard-fried egg with Lettuce rather than a bun! When I tell you that was the best burger I have had, YOU BETTER BELIVE ME! WOW! It was sloppy but it is so flavorful and juicy. The vegetarian patty they put on melts like butter! You have to go and see Jacy!!! She was amazing and told me just how good the conflicted burger was! GOOD LOOKIN OUT JACY! I just found my new favorite burger!"}
{"text":"This place is highly overpriced and overrated.   My $6 hamburger was smaller than most hamburgers at McDonald's, and didn't taste any better."}
{"text":"Very expensive for the food. If you want to splurge on dinner go for it, but expect to spend almost 10.00 for a burger and 30-40 per couple total. Good food, just costly."}
{"text":"This is no ordinary burger joint. We have been coming to Burgerfi since it open at this location. I can truly say it has met or exceeded our expectations each time. Of course the food is great and made to our specs: meat well done, no salt on meat or fries. What we notice more about this place is the attention to detail by its staff. Aaron who took and delivered our order was excellent. He was patient with a smile with our specific order requests. He and another staff came by our table to check to see how we were doing. When he noticed that we were going to take some food home he politely excused himself into our conversation and asked if we were going to need a bag for the remaining food. When you experience a staff like this it tells you that they are being treated well by Managment all the way up to the top. Did I mention the restrooms were very clean. Details.."}
{"text":"Just another overpriced burger joint.    They do serve beer. Not sure about wine coolers. This is not a positive or negative for me.  I have been there twice. For some reason my girlfriend likes this place.   Meat was bland no salt or seasoning, All the toppings on the burger were fresh. Huge bun with a small meat patty. For me the bread is only there so you can hold the meat in your hand.  The onion rings are large and crisp. You can bite a piece off. Not slurp the onion out of the breading. The seasoning here too was bland. Personally I prefer smaller onion rings that have some flavor.  The portions of the fries is generous, but here again bland no flavor. The second time the cheese helped but still not very tasty.  I would never choose to go here. I would however go along if a friend or family member wanted to eat there."}
{"text":"Service was only okay as we had to repeat our order multiple times before the woman entered it correctly.  The burgers were juicy but nothing exceptional.  I wouldn't come back often because it was overpriced but overall it was good."}
{"text":"I came here expecting a line and there was a huge line to order, the burgers aren't anything special I could have made the same burger for 1/4 the cost. The fries and the onion rings were great it everything had an add on cost. For vinegar with the fries it was an additional .77. If you wanted to add steak sauce to your burger it was an additional dollar! Which is just plain outrageous. We ordered 2 burgers, a fry ring combo and 2 drinks and the total was $27.32!!! For a fast food style restaurant that is outrageous. The 2 of us can go to chipotle for $18.00 or 5 guys for less than 20.00. This is my first and last time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We waited for 45+ minutes and never received our food. Everyone else in there was in the same boat. They kept filling to go orders instead of people who were dining in. We asked for a refund and DIDNT EVEN GET AN APOLOGY. We will NOT be returning to this place and plan on spreading the word to whoever we can."}
{"text":"First time here, friendly atmosphere! Staff is excellent , they were patient with my rookie experience! Food came out fast without losing its quality! Get the cheese fries for sure! Don't get stingy and go ahead and build your own burger!"}
{"text":"Had a great atmosphere .  The CEO burger with waygu (american cobe) beef is phenomenal.  Fries awesome, service friendly, prices what you would expect.  Yelp checkins get free ice cream which is also very good."}
{"text":"Went in their and ordered two burgers and fries they were ok tasting burgers the fries were great the service was ok you just get that your another number feeling tho and the place could use more seating but the place was very clean"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious and on point. No hormones, no antibiotics and fresh and incredibly tasty. They cater to low carb and make lettuce wraps burgers, but then they also make amazing burgers like the breakfast style and 28-day aged beef burger. They have a vegetarian burger which looks amazing and the each sauce is made with love. Love the industrial gastropub type ambiance and Sean (taking our order) was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Burger good, fries good, soda machine good.  Solid and filling, a bit more expensive than the common fast food items but this is higher quality and tastier, though still a load of calories (which they post thankfully).   The second time I went in 2 days they were all out of non-meat options which was a bummer.  The science of burger addiction is well refined here.  The fries are nice and smoky charred tasting, very addictive, mind that they come in massive portions (the family size I had to talk my Mom out of, the large was enough--2000 calories for family size!).   Nice for a splurge."}
{"text":"Very good! Had a burger and cheese fries. They did forget the cheese and when I asked about it, I got minimal cheese but overall the food was great! Somewhat pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Went today for the 1st time I had the Vienna Hotdog and my husband had a hamburger and the Parmesan herb Fries the Buns were so soft and delish I give 4  The soda machine ran out of Cherry Coke :/  you need one in Chandler or Gilbert because the one in Mesa was Far"}
{"text":"BurgerFi @Cuyahoga Falls  For weekly reviews like @Cleveland Bites on Facebook!  Had to grab a quick bite with the wife before heading up to a convention in Hudson Friday night. I do a lot of my shopping at the Giant Eagle behind this place and the fresh decor and stunning graphics always allured me into adding this place onto my list even though it's a chain. I'm a burger fanatic after all. So finally I had a chance where I needed to grab something quick on my way North. It's a counter service fast-casual restaurant that obviously put a lot of money into making the interior as hip and modern as possible. They also boasted heavily of 'gourmet' food, grass fed beef, and fresh local produce as well as any other foodie buzzword you might come up with. That's all well and good, but if your food doesn't back it up then I don't really care about any of that. The menu while appearing large and intimidating had surprisingly few choices. Burgers, veggie burgers, dogs, sides, and shakes. There were only a few options as far as burger choices went so my wife and I both grabbed one each with a 'fry & cry' combo of you guessed it; frys and onion rings. It's a nice idea to have this so two people sharing can split and have a bit of each so kudos for that. I will mention though the wife and I stuck with water there was a selection of beer, wine, and other choices as well as a handful of drinkable ice cream options.  The wife had the 'Breakfast All Day Burger' with  cheese, bacon, fried egg, syrup, and hashbrowns on it. I had 'The Twenty Eight' with brisket burger, swiss and blue cheese, and Burgerfi sauce. Mine was very mediocre. The blue cheese didn't kick me the way I typically want it to and the rest of the burger seemed rather blah to be honest. I was excited to give my wife's burger a shot but the combination of sweet syrup, runny yolk, and potato made me want to gag. I don't know who's idea it was to add a hashbrown to a burger, but it wasn't a good one. The biggest complaint was that they were small. When I'm paying close to $10 for a burger I want them to be substantial enough to really fill me up!  I was hoping for better luck with the fries and onion rings. The onion rings were gigantic. They were so huge I had trouble even managing how to eat then and had to settle with crushing them down and nibbling at them. Does anybody like onion rings like this? Not to mention they were 75% breading which is a terrible concept. The fries might have been good if they didn't taste like week old grease. I'm not sure how often they cycle they're fryers, but these fries were soggy with old grease and I couldn't even finish them.  I'm not sure what this place wants to be. Chic burger bistro? Competition for 5 guys? Upscale burger bar? No matter what they're trying to achieve they fail. There isn't a single reason I ever want to return here. Vibrant decor, foodie lingo, and stylish graphic design will only carry you so far when you're food doesn't live up to any of it. Sad to say it made me wish I went to Burger King.  Bill for 2 with water, 2 burgers, fry and onion ring combo was $25.  Atmosphere -   *** Price -               * Quality -           ** Taste -              ** Service -          ***  Good Points - I had to think for a long time about something to add here and I don't really have any positive feedback.  Bad Points - Overpriced for what you get. - Not a lot of options to choose from.  - Didn't feel like care was taken in preparing the food."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  I got the conflicted burger because I love freshly made veggie burger patties.  It was seriously the best burger I have eaten period.  The French fries were really crispy and seasoned well.  The place was very clean, and the staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"The best burger I've had in a while!  Excellent service, cozy interior, great soda selection and half the price of Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers. The place smelled great, just like a juicy burger does. This is my new favorite burger joint."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and have yet to be disappointed. The staff is helpful and friendly, the burgers are great, and the atmosphere is wonderful. There are few places that serve all natural or free range, and this place is somewhere we feel good about supporting."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Lots of choices of burgers and they are some of the best around. The fries are great too. The 3 stars is based on price. I think it's over priced and too expensive to feed a family of 5 burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I've been looking for an excuse to go back because it's a little far (we live in Central Phoenix) but it's worth the trip. We landed there when dinner reservations fell through elsewhere. Share a meal. Lots of delicious food."}
{"text":"The burgers were sooo delicious. Very heathy no additives in beef. So satisfying. We will definitely come back soon! Nice ambience and love the soda  machines. The service was excellent. Very nice and accommodating employees. Nice Friday night treat for me and my daughter.?"}
{"text":"Mediocrity at its best. Paper thin patties.... I don't think I've ever seen patties this thin. My wife and I spent $23 on two burgers, fries and onion rings. The meat was good. I'll give them that. The only way to taste the paper thin meat is to take it out of the burger.  Could have gone to Wendy's and had a better, more filling burger. Epic disappointment."}
{"text":"We always order from this place with Uber eats and every time is more delicious than the last. The hamburger buns are toasted to perfection, the meat is good quality, the selection of toppings are great, and the French fries are so tasty. Overall this place satisfies my appetite."}
{"text":"Ppl were ranting about the \"All natural\" burgers - they are frozen patties. There was a long line of customers upset at the fact the food took forever. 20 min wait just for ice cream. The kicker of the whole experience was the 6 dollar burger that looks like it came from In and Out. Place is ridiculous. Wont last."}
{"text":"Love the burgers here.  I enjoy the yummy beef and tasty toppings.  The fries and rings (fry n cry) are super good. The ranch is simply the BEST!"}
{"text":"We arrived on a Saturday night at 8:45. The sign on the door said they closed at 10 pm. We were surprised to find they were already shutting down the restaurant. We ordered 2 drinks with our meals only to find that they had already put away the iced tea and fruit juice dispensers. I only drink iced tea or still water and had to go next store to get something to drink with my meal. Had I known this earlier, we would have left and eaten elsewhere. We also noticed that half the tables has been cleared of the napkin dispensers. All of this an hour and 15 minutes before closing, making the customer feel like they are an intrusion. No apology was given when I asked about the tea and subsequently requested a refund.   Our last rating was a 5/5. We still love the food but this kind of service is unacceptable. We will not drive out of our way as we often do to come here, if we cannot be ensured that the items we want to order are available and we are made to feel like an inconvenience."}
{"text":"I visited the Val Vista store yesterday expecting to be \"wowed\" by the Beyond Meat burger.  You know, the one that looks, tastes, and feels like real meat.  What a disappointment!  The patty looked and tasted like the many veggie patties at other restaurants except that this patty is much smaller and more expensive.  It was a patty that's I would expect on their VeggieFi, not the more expensive Beyond Burger.  Over $10 for a small burger.  The bun was chewy and not at all like one would expect from such an expensive burger.  Sorry for such a negative comment, but my expectations were certainly higher than the reality.  BJ's is still my go-to place."}
{"text":"Good food, burgers are thin. Liked the lettace wrap. Fries are huge. Kids liked the custard"}
{"text":"A fluke we drove by and it caught my husbands attention because he ate at a BurgerFi on the east coast during a business trip, so I said ok, I will give it a try and I was starving. Saturday afternoon was not too crazy busy, the front counter customer service was very pleasant and polite.  Our food came out fairly quickly, they did make everything fresh.  I had a cheese burger and was so delicious, way too big, I ate a little over half of the burger and love the fries.  This place does not have 100 items on their menu, they serve burgers, fries and onion rings, they do have a hotdog and they make homemade custard.  Wish it was closer to home but defiantly having this again."}
{"text":"the owner/manager was very helpful and the service was good. but... $12 for a burger, fries, and a soda was a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Well, I heard this place was awesome, so I was in the neighborhood today and I decided to pop in.  I was greeted fast, the server was patient as I looked over the menu and the manager/owner made some recommendations. The menu is larger than Five guys, but they don't have as many toppings.   I firmly believe the only way to test a true cheeseburger is to have it plain, no condiments... Just cheese. I did opt for their secret sauce, though. I also got the onion rings.    The burger was good, a cross between Freddy's and 5 guys. Not as juicy as 5 guys and thicker than Freddy's. The bun was a regular potato bun, which was nice, reminded me of a homemade style.  The onion rings. Wow. They are a must. They are massive and some of the best I've ever had.   Gave it 4 stars because I think if they used a fattier meat, the burger would be excellent, but they opted for a \"healthy\" meat, so it's a tad dry.  Definitely will be back, though."}
{"text":"We stopped in to this place because we like trying new places.   What a great find!  I am especially pleased by the \"free range beef' and sustainable decor.  You can tell that *every* aspect of this business has been thought of from the customer's perspective.  I initially thought it odd that the ketchup cups (serve yourself condiments) were wide and shallow.  I thought they were trying to save money on the cups and condiments.   But, as it turns out, anyone ordering onion rings NEEDS those cups in order to completely dip their ring in the condiment of their choice.     I ordered the chicago dog (opted for the Kobe beef) and it was delicious.   My friend had the cheeseburger and while the burger wasn't gigantic, it tasted fabulous.    I will absolutely eat here again.  The assistant manager (so nice!) asked us about our experience as we were leaving and you could tell she genuinely wanted feedback.  She wasn't just asking for the sake of asking.  We will go here again, but only on weeks that I work out regularly.  I don't want to have hold back when we eat here. :)"}
{"text":"If you like all natural and grass fed Angus beef burgers, this is the place to go. Everything is farm fresh and cooked to order, tastes so fresh. Very delicious! The Kobe beef hot dog is amazing! Fries and onion rings are hand cut. Really clean place and fresh delicious food."}
{"text":"Ok, so I did return to Burger Fi, after the first experience and I have to admit, it was pretty tasty.  My daughter and I built our own burgers and order the combo Cry and Fry, onion rings and fries.  The burgers were kinda small for the price, but fresh and delicious, as were the fries and onion rings.   I would return."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now, both ordered through courier service and inside the restaurant. It's a pretty modern, clean looking restaurant. They have a pretty unique way of ordering, when you walk in, there are screens that you can place your order on. They goes as far as being able to customize your burger as much as you like on the screen, which I personally really like. The burgers are pretty good, average diner style burger. Where they really shine is their vanilla custard. It's extremely creamy and thick and delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it was a disappointment. I ordered the CEO burger. The meat left a lot to be desired. It had a limp texture with no flavor. The toppings were hard to even notice. Also ordered the fries and rings. These were very good (especially the fries), but they messed up our order and covered them with parmesan cheese and sauce when we asked for the sauce on the side. After our food, we decided to share the banana churro shake. The shake had the consistency of milk, very thin. Tasted decent (probably too sweet), but was not really a shake. I want to try again, but it is just not worth the price at all."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised! Very clean inside, staff greeted us as soon as we walked in :) she asked if this was our first visit, and even helped us navigate through the menu. The burger!! So good :) not oily, super fresh, and the logo is branded into the bun! Super fun, we were going to take a picture, but we ate it....."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try BURGERFI for a while now and Saturday night was the night.  I was surprised that there wasn't a longer wait since it was the 4th of July.  We were sort of excited about the concept of a restaurant serving burgers and wine/beer.    When I saw patrons drinking from plastic cups on the patio on our way into the restaurant I assumed that they didn't want glasses on the patio... wrong.  I ordered red wine and it was served to me in a plastic glass - much like a picnic or a cost-saving wedding reception.  Nothing about BURGERFI seems to be \"cost-saving\" though.  This place is expensive compared to other burger places with better food.  The dining room itself was crowded!  The two of us were lucky to find a high-top for 6 (we would have taken a smaller table but there were none available).  One thing I noticed was that many families eat here and seat the kids at a \"kid's\" table while they sit at another table.  I am a stickler for atmosphere and I did not like the atmosphere of this restaurant.  It is light, bright, open, and stark with a cafeteria-style service concept.  We didn't expect this based on the reviews.  The chairs (though lovely as pieces of stainless steel sculpture) reminded us that we were not expected to hang out there.  The low backs ensure that patrons don't relax and contemplate their surroundings (or their food) too much.  The atmosphere conveys the feeling, \"Eat your food and get out... don't think about it too much.\"  We ordered cheeseburgers - I paid $1.00 for extra cheese.  We also got a basket of fries (extra crispy at NO extra charge).  I requested a side of hot sauce (waaaaayyy too much vinegar - the sides of my tongue were numb until Sunday afternoon), and a side of sliced jalapenos (fresh!).  The fries were ample and done perfectly!  It is hard to find fresh-cut fries cooked extra crispy!  I was disappointed by the size of the condiment cups for the self-serve ketchup.  If you've ever visited someone in the hospital and they put their medication in a shallow, single-serving paper cup (about the diameter of a half dollar), you can picture the size of these condiment cups.  My husband stayed at the table to guard it while I went to get ketchup.  I could only carry 3 of these back to the table at once - hardly enough for a basket of fries.  I love potato buns - and the cute BURGERFI brand burned into the tops were a nice touch.  The burgers were quite small but were tall.  For the life of me I cannot remark on the flavor of the meat!  There was nothing extraordinary about the burgers.  I can describe every nuance of a Swenson's double cheeseburger, or a Roosters cheeseburger, but I can't describe anything about the taste of our burgers on Saturday evening.  I understand that part of the allure of BURGERFI is the \"free range, no antibiotics, no hormone\" state of the beef, but how about taste?  Each burger has two thin patties - would there be more taste with ONE 3/4 pound patty?  I eat for taste as much as I eat to live.  Sadly, there was nothing about the burgers that I will crave in the future.  Considering the $40 price tag for the evening meal, I expected an amazing experience.    The youth and excuberance of the wait staff leads me to believe that BURGERFI would be a GREAT place for a teenager to get a job!  It also seems to be a good place for families to bring their kids.  However it lacks atmosphere and is TOTALLY OVERPRICED (even given the charmed life of the cattle one consumes here).  I am giving BURGERFI 3 stars for a mediocre meal, but I can't imagine that we'll be back."}
{"text":"This would be a 4 1/2 stars if there were that option.  We ate there last night and the food was great. My wife had a cheeseburger and I had the 1/2 and 1/2 burger, which  was excellent.  We split one order of cry and fries. The portion size was great enough food for both of us, cook well, served in a family friendly environment.  The reason for the 1/2 star is they have no Gluten free option, which means for us it is not a family option."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not only are the burgers amazingly delicious, the fries are incredible! Get them with the rosemary garlic aioli and you'll be in heaven! Also, Robyn is awesome! So helpful, funny, and personable! She really made us feel welcome and comfortable. Milkshakes are pretty dang good too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have not had a burger in several years because it's not something I choose to eat.  I had the no buns burger, Kobe dog, veggiefi burger, cheese burger, onion rings, and fries delivered to my office by an awesome friend. I tried a little bit of everything. I LOVED EVERYTHING. It was so , so, so good. I'm health conscious. So the fact that these are quality and  healthy food that taste great is a plus.  I would feed my family these food everyday."}
{"text":"Messed up order... had to ask for draft beer multiple times before the only person of age remembered to pour rather than ring... fries were limp and greasy...   hubby's veggie burger ended up being beef... did not check receipt after paying... patties are thin, overcooked, tasteless... smothered in rubbery American cheese...   the beer was cold... bad when that is the highlight...  nothing like any five guy's I have ever been to... Will not be back... as others suggest... Rail or five guys... or swenson's if you want a veggie burger... Retro Dog if you want a staff that ignores you but more comfortable surroundings."}
{"text":"im surprised this place got 3 stars. i drove all the way out to mentor from bainbridge township because of all the hype around this place and its \"ethics\" about food and i was surely disappointed. i agree with all other reviews, the staff is unfriendly and the burgers are overpriced. but everyone failed to mention how SALTY these burgers are. i mean really i couldnt eat more than one bite it was that bad. there french fries are not salty at all however and need seasoning asap. i asked the employee for dipping sauce and she gives me a pink sauce that she compares to mc donalds 'mac sauce'. its sad to say the sauce did not come even close to comparing to mac sauce. it was cold, chunky, and tasteless. cant believe this is a chain"}
{"text":"Hot dog was less than luke warm. \"Craft beers\" is more of a marketing ploy - nothing special. Fries were average. Prefer other, less expensive options."}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal. Onion rings were gigantic! Price was absolutely ridiculous though. My husband and I both got a burger, I got onion rings, he got fries, and we both had small drinks and the total was $39! Likely won't come back due to the cost. I admit it was good but there are no burgers worth $39 for 2 people!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing...  best burger I have had in awhile.  The orders of fries are meant to be shared so be prepared."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced but excellent burgers! Try the CEO, its pretty awesome. You can definetly taste the differnce in premium meats used here over other places."}
{"text":"First of all, I am beyond puzzled by these reviews that have anything negative to say at all! I've been here 3 times and I have thoroughly enjoyed each visit!  The decor is beautiful, clean, and modern. They always have an impressive drink selection (beer/bottled sodas/shakes/a cool soda machine) and I think their menu is fantastic.   Maybe I don't care so much about \"thin burgers\" because I don't have a huge appetite, but their burgers have never BOTHERED me in any way. I mostly get the chili cheese dog because it's so good! Also, the fries with Cajun spices are what dreams are made of.   On my most recent visit, the girl working behind the counter was so adorable and pleasant and helpful! Customer service is a BIG DEAL. Along with good food, that is what people remember from their visits. It's so important that restaurants employ kind and knowledgeable people and that has always been the case here in my experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and overall I liked it. Feel like it checked all the boxes. Very clean and nice inside, friendly staff, I liked music in background and Tv' the wall. Food came out quick; burger was juicy and fresh and loved the loaded fries. It does cost more but I felt like the quality of the food and overall ambiance of the restaurant justifies it so I will come back"}
{"text":"The place was clean and catchy. The staff was really nice and treated us good. I didn't like the onion rings because they're huge and all I could taste was the onions and no batter! But other than that the burgers and frys were good. I would recommend it. I spent $30 for 2 meals."}
{"text":"First time here today, very delicious, definitely will be returning. Only suggestion is wrapping a bit more lettuce around the lettuce wrap burgers."}
{"text":"Amazing place to stop in for a bite to eat! My boyfriend had the Bugerfi Baconburger, and I had the CEO...both out of this world! I highly recommend the CEO to anyone looking for a delectable experience! Not only we were welcomed when we walked in the door, but our cashier Kellz was so helpful in helping us decide what to eat and beyond patient with some of our allergy restrictions/modifications. Definitely bringing my family here when they get into town!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch because I was looking for something \"healthy\" and they advertise all natural burgers.  I ordered a double and had it \"green style\" meaning it came with a lettuce bun instead of a bread bun.  Surprisingly this was not annoying at all.  The burger was a good size, had nice flavor and was not at all greasy.   I had the regular fries and they were also very tasty and crisp.  They also were not greasy so it at least gives the illusion of trying to eat healthy (fresh all natural potato!) even if they are probably cooked in a vat of fry grease.    When I left I was satisfied and full but not overly stuffed.  It was perfect.  I did not have a heavy ball of grease in my stomach that makes me want to go to sleep like you get at 5 Guys.    I also noted that they had Big Blue Van beer in a bottle, which is so deliciously blueberry-y as well as Purple Haze on draft.    I definitely will be back to try some other burgers and beers."}
{"text":"BurgerFi is pretty good. I wouldn't go out of my way here for burgers but wouldn't mind eating here if I'm in the area. I have driven by many times but hesitated due to the mediocre reviews but finally after months, we decided to go.  We ordered a breakfast burger, the double cheeseburger, herb parm fries and one draft beer. It costs us around $22. Many have mentioned it was pricy, but I felt the pricing was fair. The burgers came with double patties and the regular sized fries was large enough to share between 2 people. Also, people commented that the burgers were on the smaller side but I thought it was the perfect size. It's similar to the size of In-N-Out burgers."}
{"text":"The veggie burger was one of the best I've ever had and I've had a lot veggie burgers. I got the fries extra crispy and the fry portion was generous and they were tasty. My only complaint is the veggie burger price. I'm not used to paying extra for a veggie burger and for the price I would have expected a much larger burger with a much thicker piece of cheese.  I'd actually be fine with the burger size and the paper thin slice of cheese if the price was lower. I'll go back, but not near as much as I would if the vegetarian prices were a little more reasonable."}
{"text":"The pictures make the burgers look ginormous, but they're really not monstrosities. I will definitely do a double next time. That being said, the burger was flavorful and enjoying. I'd say this place is in the burger shop rotation, but probably not in the top 2 or 3 locations."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and this is now one of my new favorite burger spots !  The girl who helped us was so nice, let us sample beers, and made helpful suggestions on our orders. Super nice and the service itself was 10/10.   The burgers were OUT OF BOUNDS!  Seriously though so good. I had a bacon cheese burger (so cheesey!) and my bf had the conflicted burger (1 beef patty and 1 veggie patty) and both were so good. The bacon on my burger was cooked perfectly, crispy but not burnt.    We shared the fries/onion rings combo and did urban style fries. Highly recommend! The fries had a garlic aioli drizzle over tons of grated Parmesan on the fries, seriously would return just for these.   Also had some awesome four peaks beers that I haven't had before!   All around a quality place that I will definitely be returning to!"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I was fortunate enough to have tried BurgerFi a couple of weeks ago during an elite  event. It was awesome. I have been dreaming of this burger since then and finally found the time to try it again.   The burger did not disappoint. Probably the best burger I had so far. You can customize any burger but I loved the sample of the their double cheese burger I had at the Elite event. Today it was even better. I added an egg which just elevated it to another level. Piping hot, juicy, beefy, cheesy, eggy with that runny yoke. It was perfection. The bun is soft, but holds up and did not disintegrate. This burger was so satisfying. I will probably be going back to tomorrow. Lol.   BurgerFi beef is clean and sustainable. Everything in this place is about serving amazing food at a reasonable price. The options are endless on what you can add or subtract on your burger or hot dog. They even have a veggie burger.   The fries are hand cut and delicious. The onions rings are hand battered and awesome. The drinks are also endless from the coke machine with free refills.   I love burgers. BurgerFi IMOis the best so far. The meat tastes better and seems fresher. The burger is way  more juicy than shake shack, hopdaddy, or in and out. Their meat does not have the beefy flavor of BurgerFi's burgers. I can't recommend them highly enough.   I would recommend the regular burgers over their CEO burger which I found a bit tough. Stick with the regular burgers.   Food 5/5. Service 5/5. Overall 5/5.   I really can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try Burgerfi for a while now and finally indulged on Saturday. It was a beautiful day so we had the pleasure of sitting at the tables out on the patio/sidewalk. When we entered, I noticed how clean and organized everything was.   We went to the front counter to look at the menu board which has a lot of options and never having been to Burgerfi before, I was a little overwhelmed but quickly decided on the Burgerfi cheeseburger. Hubby got the same thing with no tomato and we shared a cry fry (fries + 3 onion rings). When you order, they give you a little tracking device to put on your table so they can bring you the correct food order when it's ready.   We used the coke remix machines to get fancy pops, that was fun. They also sell beer and wine which is unique.   When our food arrived, we were both kinda like wow, this is a big burger! It was very greasy but tasty. The fries were good, no big woo. The onion rings were the best I've ever had! Very delicious!   Overall, good quality food. A little pricey for what you get. Our meal was $26. I feel like I could get the same quality at 5 Guys and pay a tad less."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers, but it's a fancy 5 guys. Kids liked the pop machine, while dad liked the beer."}
{"text":"I was there this past Saturday night and was amazed for my first time being there. I got the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious! The chili fries were amazing! The service was great and the food was delivered faster than expected. I love the vibe and the music choices are top notch! Every time I was ready to leave I stayed to hear that next song and got a refill! Def will be going back! Highly recommend if your looking for a great burger joint"}
{"text":"Burgerfi is top notch establishment.   Quinoa burger is the best veggie patty even a meatarian would love.  Onion rings are perfectly done. You can fold one over with hardly any oil dripping off."}
{"text":"Well. Been waiting to try this burger joint. First impression; great location, great ambiance....great menu...a soda machine....yes! And great atmosphere.   Other than that....extremely disappointing. I mean....I love burgers and fries....and I could barely finish this one. Thats a first.   Thoughts: very expensive. Alot of smoke and glitter from menu...pictures and options. I got the CEO burger and fries. My companion got the grilled cheese. Well, the soda machine was awesome! Okay....the burger was almost non existent; looked like a step up from a slider. The fries were not fresh!!!! They were soft and sad. The burger....was undercooked. Resembled a frozen burger that didn't spend enough time on the grill or griddle. I should have sent it back...but at that point...I would have or should have requested a full refund! Looked like they used 2 hammie buns for the grilled cheese as well. Not appetizing at all. Well the soda was great.  Sorry Burger Fi. Dont believe the hype."}
{"text":"First visit and it will not be the last!  Wanted to grab a burger for dinner but I do not eat fast food burgers.  I prefer to make my burgers at home (Dad's recipe) if I'm going to have one.  My boyfriend loves them so I gave in this one time & sure am glad I did.  I ordered a single cheeseburger with white cheddar, lettuce, tomato and Burgerfi sauce.  My boyfriend ordered the CEO burger(double wagu-brisket blend, truffle aioli, swiss cheese) .  I had a bite and honestly could have had a few more.  Both were great - quality, juicy, cooked to medium temp.   I added mustard to mine while the homemade candied bacon jam on his was enough of a flavor enhancer.  We split the regular order of fries (honestly, that serves 4) which were very tasty (could have used a little more salt) served hot and cooked in 100% peanut oil.  Toppings like chili, cheese, chili-cheese, salt & vinegar, Parmesan-herb, aioli (garlic, truffle, parmesan herb-garlic are all available for the fries.  Since this was our first visit we opted to forgo the toppings.    Service was friendly, helpful and never rushed.  We went in after 5 on a Sunday, the restaurant was 2/3rds full but plenty of outdoor seating.  The are several beers on tap for the adults and misc. Coke products for the kids.    My boyfriends burger was so good he said 'I wish I could have your bite back!\"  Hilarious"}
{"text":"If you love your burgers killed twice and burned then this is the place to eat. A medium rare burger is as rare as gold backing the dollar. After telling them medium rare on their CEO burger it's burned and after complaining they say they have to burn it. So prime burger meat needs to be killed and burned so you don't know what kind of meat it really is. Can u say surprise meat?"}
{"text":"Horrible,slow, rude and un-trained service staff. Dry burger buns w/burger patties served cold and that crumble apart in your hands."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger, a little pricey but that's what you expect. Not dying to go back, but will eventually."}
{"text":"This is a God-send for burgers!  Great place to take the kids and not one time has this place ever been \"hit or miss.\"  You find yourself going up a second time for another!! So beware!  Our kids favorite and now our favorite place when we want a good burger!"}
{"text":"I like a good burger but the burgers are small, dried out and not really good.  I like the fries and onion rings, the soda machines are crazy interactive and self service.  My first visit was tolerable.  But maybe because they were new?  Just not super impressed where I'd type more than a paragraph about it.   Give it a try -- because I like to support businesses in my community.  For me, truly a \"meh\"."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at all of the \"so-so\" reviews. I thought the food was fantastic! The atmosphere was great too.   I built my burger because I'm a baby and don't like to be adventurous and try pre-thought out selections. Lol, but damn, it was fabulous. The pickles knocked that burger out of this world and into burger oblivion.   My husband ordered the breakfast burger and all he did in between bites was talk about how amazing the burger was.   Fries were amazing and the onion rings were HUGE and full of deliciousness.   $25 for two nomtastic burgers, onion rings, fries and two drinks. Pricey, but completely worth it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time in history I have finished my food before my husband! This place is DELICIOUS! I just wish it wasnt so far from me."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries were pretty good.  I like the size of the patties. It kind of reminded me of In and Out Burger. (In and Out still wins)  Love the natural cut fries.   Downfall; the place needs better management.  There's all real young guys working there and the dining area was filthy.  Every table was dirty, the floors were dirty, and all three of the large trash cans were over flowing. I actually watched an employee walk past the trash,  look at it and just continue back to the kitchen.  He chose to ignore it.  As a customer you are expected to dump your tray when finished.  But that's disgusting.  For two burgers and a large fry for $18, I expect cleanliness."}
{"text":"The burgers are good and they give you the calories for each thing on the menu. For a burger, they're pretty healthy. The fries and onion rings are pretty tasty as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and shakes.  Red velvet is to die for.  They also offer a selection of alcoholic beverages as well."}
{"text":"All around disgusted with the place. Very disappointed because it had so much potential. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Burgers, fries, service was awesome. Way better than Five guys. Burgers and fries were not greasy and all the employees including the manager made contact. Will definitely return and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Burgers are not bad, but a little bit over priced for what you get. They do have great milk shakes."}
{"text":"This one use to be a local for me and is rather a new spot.  I don't have much to say about it because the burgers are just ok and nothing special for me. For just $2 more I can get myself a really good hamburger and so that's just what I'll do."}
{"text":"Thoughts to myself: Maybe I should stay away from these type of high end burger places - constant disappointment.    The place was clean and attractive. The menu was easy to understand and organized.  There were large televisions everywhere with different sporting events on.   I ordered the CEO. It was \"OK\". It was close to $11.00 for the burger. I was still hungry after eating it. We ordered onion rings for table - not sure if we received the large or the regular - as the staff did not ask which I wanted.   I may try again as the person with me loved their Bacon Cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Orders through the App are always wrong. Today was order #5 - a CEO burger, a vanilla shake and a bottle of soda. The CEO burger had NOTHING on it! I have a screenshot of my online order just in case I need to prove anything. The vanilla shake was supposed to have chocolate syrup ON it but they made it a chocolate shake. I only go here because my son likes it and it's on the way home from my daughter's ballet classes. Save your money - you can get a great grass-fed beef burger at the Flip Side or at least a better tasting and more consistent burger from Five Guys.  Edited to reflect correspondence  with the owner:    I received a prompt email from Kris, the owner, who is doing all he can to correct the ordering issues. I think that counts for a lot. This restaurant is in an area that I would like to see continue to thrive so I hope they are successful. We will most likely give it another try since my son and daughter enjoy their burgers and shakes. Thank you for your help, Kris!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to grab a quick bite. The ceo burger with a added egg is my go to. To make the meal even better get fries. If you are alone do not get a leather fry because boy it is a crap ton of food. The meat is quality and they also have vegetarian / vegan options as well. You can even do a lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get some burgers.  Come here usually to get their breakfast burger with a friend; It's a great place to go to and, while I haven't come here frequent, I can't say I'm disappointed.  Get a milkshake while you're there if you are extra hungry!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for skin-on fresh cut french fries.  Burger-Fi does an absolutely fantastic job with these.  I have been to the ASU location several times now, and they never fail. The burgers are always fresh and delicious.  The staff is friendly and always willing to help the customers.    I am also very pleased with the speed of service.  I have never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes for my order.  I will definitely be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool. I like the decor and vibe. It is a bit too expensive for the taste or type of casual lunch place. The veggie patty was tasty. The side of fries was huge. $13 for small soda, veggie burger, & fries.  It os a very clean place... But smelled a  little strange walking in.  I like that the have lots if food options other than burgers; hot dogs, custard, shakes, craft beer, etc."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, the cashier/ server Diane was very knowledgeable. Honestly we weren't sure what to expect , she guided us through the menu in great detail; while on a busy Friday night . So thank you for the cold beer, great food and awesome service ."}
{"text":"Loved it! The single with cheese with the norm was delicious, we ordered onion rings and friends and they are awesome! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The palace has private parking. Soon as you enter the place you are welcomed by a wonderful atmosphere. Hardwood floor, lighting, wood panels and not to mention the awesome music is great. The have also installed really awesome,really intuitive self service kiosks (they have 2 at the moment). As today was my first day at the Burgerfi I didn't expect the experience to go this so smooth. Guess I was in for a surprise.  Furnitures are looking cool and as well as the patio  **update** I ordered two burgers and a small fry and they were pretty good"}
{"text":"I've never had a burger this damn good! The CEO is hands down the best. I don't know if I have the willpower to order anything else...."}
{"text":"The food is good but a kids meal burger at BK is bigger then a single burger here, besides it being triple the price. For 2 thin hot dogs, one single burger, one double burger, a order of regular fries, 2 regular drinks, and a bottled water for 40 bucks is way too much!!! We will not go back!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. Burger was mediocre and bland. Not sure what makes french fries dry, but they were dry and flaky...don't know how else to explain them!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is. For the price paid it felt like overpriced in and out. We ordered the bacon cheeseburger and a standard cheeseburger and it was ok.  The fries were really overdone I don't know if it was meant to be like this if so I don't get it.  Otherwise the burgers weren't bad but when you can get in and out for half the price why wouldn't you"}
{"text":"Ohh they toast their name on the bun, so they must be legit!  This place is new in town and people are flocking for their combination of great friendly service, high quality ingredients, and  huge selection.  The manager or owner of this place is really friendly and you can tell he truly cares.  I overheard a couple of conversations with his employees and could tell they all like and respect him.  This kind of work environment coupled with their trendy decor and super coke machine makes for cool place to hang.  My wife and I both had cheeseburgers and they were very good, however the portions are very small for the price.  I understand the meat is higher quality angus, but I was expecting more food when I pay $8 for a burger.  Their onion rings are excellent!!!  Must try these and they had many combinations you can too off your fries with.    Check in on social media and get a free ice cream."}
{"text":"Heck yeah, I love me some BurgerFi! I'm a fan of the Mesa location and Tempe seems like a perfect fit for the fast casual burger chain.   But, why-Fi? Well, when was the last time you had a fast-food burger and thought, \"That was fresh\"? Hmmm...? Right, but I feel that way whenever I eat at BurgerFi. Yes, even when I'm eating their hand-cut fries!   When you enter you the Tempe location, you are faced with a number of choices:  -Order counter or kiosks?  -Meat, Veggie, or Vegan patty? -Potato, Multi-Grain or Green Style bun? -Fries, Onion Rings or BOTH?! -Bottled or Freestyle drink? -Sit inside or outside on the patio?   One choice I recommend you make is getting your fries \"Urban Style\". Which means your crispy fries will receive a generous dusting of parmesan & herbs and then a drizzling of garlic aioli sauce. Trust me on this one, it is downright crave-worthy! (Unless you have a peanut allergy. PSA: They are fried in peanut oil -- but also why they are so delicious!)    If for some reason you are still hungry after all that, you can get one of their smooth custard treats -- shakes, floats, or concrete mixes. I got a berry waffle ice cream sandwich, the Very Berry Wafflewich (seasonal). It was a delicious mess.   Which brings me to one of my favorite details about BurgerFi: There are napkins at every table! YASSSS! How many times have you wished for a napkin and not had one right there when you needed it? Not at BurgerFi. They've got you covered!   The lettuce is crisp, the tomatoes are juicy, the condiments are organic and the food is good because BurgerFi is a downright, delectable, burger joint that meat-lovers, vegetarians, and even vegans can enjoy!"}
{"text":"When you take a bite of your burger think \"overpriced Wendy's\" because thats what it tastes like. My stomach and taste buds think I just had fast food, but my wallet does not. There is no \"how would you like your burger cooked\" at Burger Fi.   Giving a second star due to the healthier options (multigrain bun, wrapped in lettuce), snazzy pop machine, and beer."}
{"text":"BurgerFi has some amazing burgers and sweet custard! However, on our most recent visit our order was not correct but I think it was because of a new cashier. They did however make it right and all was well. Id recommend others to try this place out."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is fresh and delicious, but more expensive than I think it should be. I built a custom burger from the menu substituting white cheddar instead of the standard American cheese, regular bun and hickory bacon with single patty. Along with the burger, I got a side of onion rings and an iced tea. I was surprised when I got my order, that the burger was only slightly larger than a slider. These 3 items came to $13.59."}
{"text":"Good burger, plenty of fries in the order, not too much in the way of condiments but at least they have beer. Need to get some popular brands instead of just the craft beers and imports. All in all is was a good experience for a first try. Will most likely return."}
{"text":"This is my fav restaurant right now! I love the fact you can get grass fed delicious burgers and peanut oil fries and onion rings under $20. My boyfriend and I eat here for that price. He always gets the conflicted burger and I get the cheeseburger . Sooooooooo good! Another thing I don't feel guilty or bloated after!! Great place!!"}
{"text":"First time at this place. Right off the bat I noticed the menu which is all narrowed down to one thing they do great. And I got the double bacon double cheese double patty burgers which was awesome great perfectly cooked the funds were nice and fresh. Everything about it seem great I would definitely go back again when I'm up in the area"}
{"text":"Great burgers. The urban fries are a family favorite. Fry portions are huge! You can customize your burger or pick from a few featured burgers. The Burger Fi sauce makes a nice fry sauce. I like these better than Five Guys across the street and I really like Five Guys. It's an abundance of burger riches at this intersection. Check in on Yelp and get a free small custard."}
{"text":"Paid 14$ for a burgerfi burger and it was not that great. The meat didn't really taste good and the fries tasted like they were burned. What a waste of money , it seems that the owners are purchasing the lowest quality meat. I honestly would've been more satisfied if I just went to the McDonald's across the street. Not worth wasting your money on an unsatisfying over priced meal."}
{"text":"This place is just great. I don't even have to go into grave detail about anything. Point blank period, you want a great burger and awesome fries, you go here. No questions to ask! You don't go here, you're a slub that doesn't no great food when it slaps you in the face. I recommend the conflicted burger! Awesome!!!  What burger place do you know that has facial recognition!??? Say whaaaaaa!?   Yes, facial recognition. This is like some Mission Impossible burger place. They definitely make the impossible, possible when it comes to their food. Don't be a slub. Eat here now!!! Eat here today!!! Eat here yesterday!!!   It's that good!!!"}
{"text":"First off Jacy is great (I may of spelled her name wrong)   We hit this place up on the way to the airport. I have seen it many times but never went in. I was really hungry so I didn't read that all the burgers are doubles unless you ask for a single. All good I can handle it! By the time that I was able to eat it my burger wasn't as hot as I would like it to be but it was still good. And the onion rings.. The best ever!! They changed my life ha. And how can I forget the strawberry shake with Oreos in it.. amazing!! I will return when I can dine in and eat the food straight away.   You know it's good when you put your stamp on the burger"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best burgers and there custards are delicious! People that haven't heard of this place are missing out on these burgers that are all natural!!"}
{"text":"I'm a burger person so I am picky with my burgers. When i first tried them i was hooked immediately that I had to come back within the week and ordered for my peeps at work. Let me tell you they all loved what they ordered and said the portions were perfect, because they were able to snack on it later in the evening (we work 12 hour shifts). All their burgers come with two patties so make sure you tell them one if one patty is all you want. They also have an all plant based burger that i have not tried, but will. Something that i thought was really cool about this place was they sell alcohol and it's not your typical waitress/waiter restaurant. However they still have great customer service and the orders were done perfectly considering we ordered 15 different orders for pick up! Oh and they were fast and finished when they said they would! A++"}
{"text":"The burgers are still absolutely delicious and the staff is so incredibly friendly, I needed to update my review yet again. The food is always fresh, the fries are always cooked to perfection and there's always a feeling of immense satisfaction when you leave the store. I will miss this place when I move."}
{"text":"Not bad, a bit pricey for my taste. The food was okay but not super memorable in my book. We'll probably go back, but it's not on the top of my list of things to try."}
{"text":"This spot is a home run!  It's in a great location and they have a fantastic product.  When I first looked at the menu online I thought it reminded me of shake shack...this place is hands down better than shake shack. The interior is super clean and all the employees were so friendly.    My husband got the CEO burger and I had a single cheeseburger with grilled onions and jalapeños. We split both plus some fries.   Both burgers were delicious- very fresh tasting and cooked perfectly.  You can tell they use high quality ingredients. The fries were fresh cut- and highly addictive. Insane.  A friendly employee came around and offered samples of their \"concretes\" and we all agreed Red velvet was the family favorite! They have a good beer selection if that's your thing and my kids are huge fans of the freestyle coke machine. Any time we are back in that area of town we will be sure to hit up Burger Fi!"}
{"text":"Burgerfi is a hip and modern little spot with pretty tasty fast-casual burgers. Quality-wise, it's on par with the Habit, but with more options and a little more personality. Price-wise it's a little more than the Habit. Prices range from $5 and some change up to $9-something, but they do throw some coupons out there to bring the cost down some. The management is very cool. I met the GM and AGM at a nearby event and they threw me a bunch of coupons and a free burger. Off to a great start fellas!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, it can be hard to find a quality and tasty veggie burger, but this place delivers. The onion rings and fries are great, and I love the option to add salt and vinegar or cajun flavors. They have several local beers available and that's always a plus to me. Overall, a good casual spot to get high quality food."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. After reading the reviews, I was expecting to be disappointed. The opposite is true. While yes it was expensive compared to some other hamburg joints, the food was above average. My wife and I both purchased the Burgerfi-Hamburger. I give the whole name because just beneath it is the Burgerfi-Cheeseburg. I was rather dumbfounded that the gal who took our order asked us if we wanted cheese on our hamburg! I did mentioned to her that if I had wanted a cheeseburg, I would have asked for the Burgerfi-Cheeseburg. Surprisingly my bit of sarcasm was lost on her. But if you notice that's the policy now at many places, asking you if you really want what you asked for. As I mentioned though, the food was good. We also got the onion rings. OMG, you only got about 8-9 on a large order, but they were HUGH ! Cooked just right, and very sweet. I'm not sure if it's just the onion that was the source of the sweetness, or if they use sugar in the batter coating. Either way, they were great! The burgers came with what they call their Burgerfi sauce. I wish I could give an opinion on  how it tasted, but they put on so little that I actually couldn't taste it. Overall though I give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not bad, but for a place that claims to serve \"gourmet\" quality burgers, what I got was basically a Wendy's cheeseburger on a fresher bun. I suppose if you want a beer with your fast food, Burger Fi would be the place to go. But if you want a quality burger, there are better options in town."}
{"text":"I was really happy to find this place on Saturday night. My family wanted to eat hamburgers but only places show up on my Yelp search was bars. Not really appropriate after 7pm on weekend night to show up with family.  This place serves beer and wine and just perfect place for family dining at night.  Cheeseburger was quite delicious, it cost more than fast food but I wasn't looking for fast food  quality food anyway.  Their bucket size fries are so huge, big enough for 5-6 people.  I like their patio, it was still cool outside, perfect temperature to enjoy outdoor eating.  Very clean inside and friendly staff.  Good hamburgers, nice option to have if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"This past Saturday evening I stumbled into BurgerFi to try something new. Personally, the employee's uniforms look like they are a part of a cult or swat team which I didn't like but that's just my personal opinion. The restaurant wasn't too busy when I went around 7pm; maybe 5 other families were eating there. Since this was my first time I thought I would try something new, something out of the ordinary. The waitress suggested something off the \"secret menu\" which is printed inside the actual menu (lame). I forget the name of the burger but it had two patties, cheese, bacon, and mushrooms. I also ordered a side of onion rings. The food was prepared quickly and now it was time to eat. The restaurant has a 1000 flavor coke dispenser which is cool because it gives me the most options. After I sit down, I begin to eat...  The burger was delicious actually, a little too greasy but I liked the flavor. As a tip for you guys, try eating it upside down so the mushrooms hit the roof of your mouth instead of under your tongue; it makes the burger taste better, trust me! Something I noticed which was kind of cool was that the seedless bun on my burger had the company name \"stamped\" into the bread. The onion rings were next and I was excited to try them because they were humongous and look so delicious. The onion rings were too salty for my taste which is pretty bad because I usually cover my food in salt and pepper. The batter was good, onion strips were legit and not limp dick but it was just too salty for me.  After leaving the restaurant full for less than $10 (a fair price) I had the runs. It's not that the food was bad or undercooked or spoiled, it was just that the grease really lubed my insides. I would still go back if invited though!"}
{"text":"Awesome place nice atmosphere waiter was very informative we enjoyed the burgers and shake."}
{"text":"The best thing i can say about this place is that its what fast food SHOULD be. Basically, everything we got was mediocre. Not bad...but far from high quality. Thin, small, burger patties, a \"kobe\"  beef hot dog that tasted like every other hot dog I've ever had, and a double brisket burger that tasted exactly like the basic angus burger my friend got, but at a much higher price. Oh and the cajun fries were under-seasoned. For the same price i could have gone to Red Robin and had a far superior meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the aged burger that was like $12. $17 for burger and fries so I was expecting this burger to be the best I've had and really big. Burger was good, fries were good, just way overpriced. Definitely not there best burgers I've had though. If still try something else to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Breakfast All Day Burger... Mediocre, patties are so thin that all they can cook it at is medium to well done, no thanks. Parmesan Herbs & Cry & Fries.. Not enough flavoring, no taste to them really, and definitely an over abundance of fries, with 3 huge onion rings, but better than my burger.. Hard to mess up fries and onion rings though. Chicago style dog.. Don't even bother, I took two bites and threw it out.  As for staff, they were like zombies and not too attentive, until a group of law enforcement came in (4), oddly enough we ordered 10-15 minutes before them and we got our order after they were half way done with their meal... What happened to first come first serve?"}
{"text":"I tried this place yesterday for the first time. I am skeptical of chain fast food burgers so it took me awhile to gain the courage to try it out. The staff was so polite and helpful. I ordered the CEO burger, urban fries with Parmesan, herbs, and the garlic aioli on the side. Holy moly those fries! I will be dreaming about them for days. They are fresh cut, hot, and the perfect amount of crisp. The toppings were amazing. Love the garlic aioli. The CEO burger was fantastic. Juicy with great flavor. The food and service was great, the only downside is the price. For fast food, it is extremely expensive. But this will not stop me from coming back, just not that often. Can you add sweet potato fries to the menu please??!!"}
{"text":"Went to burgerfi for the first time tonight. I ordered chili cheese fries as my cheat meal and a burgerfi burger to eat later sans bun (doing a low carb diet) I ordered it without cheese and sauce. They bring it out with cheese so the runner takes it back brings it out without cheese in a togo box. Ok great bc I'm taking it to go anyway. Didn't think to check about the sauce. Just went to open it to have one of the patties and there is sauce on it. Come on!! You messed up my burger twice!!! So annoying!!! The fries were good and the burgerfi burger is cheap with two patties but yea triple check your food if you have requests.."}
{"text":"Went to the new Mesa, AZ location and really enjoyed the food. The onion rings were amazing and the burger (I got a single with mushrooms, swiss and lettuce with the garlic mayo) was delicious. They passed out samples of their key lime concrete and my husband, four year old son and I were all in heaven. The huge ceiling fan was awesome.   There are just a few things that I wish were different. There were five people standing behind the counter one at the 'Order Here' register and another at the 'Fast Register' or whatever it was called with another three people standing around behind them. It wasn't busy inside (we were the only ones even close to the line) and not ONE person greeted us. Then, when we had been standing there for almost five minutes (we were new and looking at the menu but eventually we LOOKED ready to order if that makes sense) there was still not a PEEP out of any of the employee's mouths. It was weird. I looked at my husband like, \"does anybody work here?\" Finally, the girl at the \"Order Here\" register asked the girl behind the quick register if she was going to help us. That girl responded with \"oh, I guess so\" like she JUST saw us. From there on, she was not pleasant and very impatient with our questions as first time customers.   From the time we ordered until we got the food it took about 25+ minutes. There were two five-top tables out on the patio with us, two two-tops inside and a four-top inside. Of those five tables, three had already received their food. Curious as to why it took this long. The customer to employee ratio was low. I saw five employees at the front and at LEAST five in the kitchen. That's 18 customers to 10 employees. Hmmmm....  The other thing is that I WISH they served Iced Tea. It seems very weird that they don't have that choice yet they have two of the new fancy soda machines. The iced tea servers next door at Jersey Mike's were just staring out at me on the patio.   Other than that, the patio was fun and the night had perfect weather. I'd say just amp up the customer service skills. Even the managers (I assume that one or two of those five people were management of some sort) need some guidance on that."}
{"text":"When you live in Akron and have so many burger choices it's hard to find awesome burgers.  I had high hopes for this place.  It's good and worth a try, but it's nothing special.  It's not a as good as Five Guys."}
{"text":"We finally stop to try out this joint. Overall, very imprssed.  I would describe BurgerFi as a better five guys. Less greases and cleaner facility. The fresh squeezed lemonade, strawberry lemonade, and sweet tea were great. A must try."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after a morning shift at work. The restaurant was nice looking inside and out, and nearly empty. 3 customers including myself, and 4 staff. Ordered a Breakfast All Day burger, fries and a drink. $11.04. Not bad. Now the bad stuff. I ordered my burger with no ketchup, and it was served with ketchup on it. The server asked me how I wanted the egg on my burger and when I replied Over Easy, he said \"uhh, so well done?\"... It was served fried hard, and crispy brown on one side. Burgers seem to only be served well done as well. I get the feeling they spent all their money on the aesthetics and fancy soda machines, and forgot to leave enough to pay their staff a decent wage. That gets you staff that don't care, and if they can't handle \"no ketchup\" on a burger when the staff out number customers, imagine what its like when they are busy. I could have got a much nicer burger for my $11. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Great service - really good burger with a lot of options.  French fries were okay and onion rings were good.  Nice and clean"}
{"text":"The burgerFi cheese burger is one of the best burger i ever tried. Also the onion rings is delicious."}
{"text":"I was amazed at how delicious their veggie burger was!  It was in a lettuce wrap, and was the best I've had - wish I knew their recipe!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a bet going and the loser had to buy the other a burger and a beer. I may have lost a bet, but in a way I also won because I was able to try something new. Well, kind of new. The burgers here are surely good, but I wouldn't say there is anything special about them that truly sets them apart from a wide range of competition. They have specialty burgers, but none of them were truly that original. Except the Conflicted Burger (a double with one meat patty and one veggie), which is definitely an interesting concept, but I'm not sure it really has any purpose in comestible existence. It truly is a paradox within the nature of food.  This actually took place shortly after its initial opening in Cuyahoga Falls, so the line was very long and we waited for quite a while both before and after ordering. They also didn't have beer, so that kind of put a hitch in our second amendment to the bet; I guess it's not that unusual for burger joints to not have beer, but it's such a perfect accompaniment that it should actually be more common, in my opinion.  It wasn't my favorite burger and it wasn't the worst. I haven't had a chance to try it again since there are so many other places to try in the whole wide world, but I don't know if an average to pretty decent cheeseburger ranks at the top of my list to retry just because it has its company logo scorched into the bun."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger person, so I tried their hot dogs. It was delicious! I finally have a burger joint that I can go to and actually get something. This is just what Cuyahoga falls needed! Only downside is having to wait for a table when they're busy"}
{"text":"I had heard about BurgerFi and finally had the chance to stop and get a burger a fries to go. I had the bacon cheeseburger and urban fries, both were phenomenal! The staff was friendly and courteous, and it didn't take much longer than getting a fast food burger. Although one review I read said the burgers were small, I beg to differ...mine was perfect, not too small, not too big. BurgerFi is my new favorite place to grab a burger!"}
{"text":"I thought food was delicious, a little pricey, but dont mind because food is so good.  Plus, im hoping LeBron will come there again when im there!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today and I have to say that the flavor of the beef is out of this world. The quality of the cheese And condiments is way better than 90% of the burger joints out there. The service was outstanding and the facility is very clean. I will definitely be coming back with my friends. Kick rocks in n' out! You've got nothin on Burgerfi! 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"What a great veggie burger!  I am glad so many restaurants are offering a veggie burger now, but so many leave much to be desired.  Not the case with BurgerFi.  Probably one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had.  Fresh, tasty, and very much like a regular burger (although it has been a really long time since I've had a real burger).  Fries and onion rings were also very good.  Friendly, prompt service and clean restaurant.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good burgers not bomb but I guess If you're looking for a good burger place this is would be one of them  I had the burger Fi cheeseburger and fries with garlic they were pretty good"}
{"text":"This is what I'm talking about. I like these kinds of burger joints. The food was fresh and nothing fake about it. Some reviews on here complained about BurgerFi being too expensive, but remember, you get what you pay for. It's definitely worth it here. If you want cheap food, go to Jack in the Box (gross) ..or eat out of a dumpster.. like those poorly groomed hipster d-bags. If you choose the path of totality and freshness, then BurgerFi is what's up."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for for this place. The burgers were ok. The fries were grease filled and mostly burnt. They went in the trash. The onion rings were huge and just ok (slightly greasy). I thoroughly enjoyed my root beer float. It was delicious and the custard was amazing. I'd go back for the custard/ root beer float. The employees were nice and the place was empty at the time I arrived. I'd recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"OK food...a bit pricey for what you get...within five miles you can get a better burger...but, it is hard to find a place that will throw an egg on top as an option...the large fry will easily feed four people...however the drinks were way too small and too expensive...we'll see how it is after the new wears off the place...good food, just nothing that you look at or taste and go, \"Oh, wow!\""}
{"text":"I'm an extreme foodie and so is my boyfriend,we were driving around and spotted Burgerfi, he had me look up the menu and we decided to go try it! We got there and the smell of the atmosphere was awesome, however the service was horrible sad to say. The 30 mins we waited, I watched 4 parties get refunded as we waited, the staff and manager didn't seem to care. Which being in the restaurant business you should care about your customers to make sure that they're satisfied with their experience. (Just a friendly tip: You should consider having a to-go cook and an in-house cook. That way people aren't waiting. Sometimes you just have to delegate jobs to each staff member #teamworkmakesthedreamwork ).Our food wasn't any better, my boyfriend had the Burgerfi cheeseburger which had what looked like the smallest piece of lettuce and barely any special sauce. I ordered the Green Vegifi, I had barely any sauce and the lettuce wrap over powered my vegifi Burger I couldn't even enjoy it! The only thing that was good were the fries! I can't explain how disappointed I am in Burgerfi's first visit!"}
{"text":"It would get a 5 if they turn the music down, and put real cheese on their chili dogs, other than that it is the best hamburger place I have been to!"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger was good with fresh veggies however it was fairly small.  Frys were really good and seemed fresh.  SERVICE WAS NOT SO GREAT!  Friendly and helpful...not at all.  At the counter the girl standing at the register gave zero acknowledgement.  I finally said, \"Hi, how are you?\"  Which I did receive a response from, whew.  I had looked at the menu online at home prior to going to BurgerFI and I looked up reviews.  I noticed there was no kids menu and that was one of the complaints that I had seen in reviews but we decided we'd give it a shot anyway.  Well, come to find out they do have a kids menu, at least at this location. However, I didn't realize until after I had ordered.  As I was ordering for my lil one I was asking her what she'd like on her burger...you would think that if you have a kids menu and someone is ordering a giant burger off the regular menu for their 2 yr old child that the cashier would maybe recommend there is a child's burger. NOPE, notta.  Idk I was just put off by this.  Then my husband had to wait about 15 minutes for his beer when they were not busy at all what so ever.  I would just recommend extra training on service and customer service.    ***I believe our cashier may have been new but if that's the case maybe have someone else up there running the counter with along side the newbe.***"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed when i got there is that the lobby was completely empty. I was ok maybe the lunch rush over , so I ordered anyway. Upon making my order the total came out to be a little bit higher than normal for a burger joint, again I just moved on. The burger I got was made to order as I asked. I got the burgerfi and Parmesan herb fries with cheese sauce in the side. Came to about $ 13 and some change , a little bit in the high side. Now to the food: the burger lacked some seasoning and the fries seemed a little bit over seasoned. The cheese sauce , well I've had better . I gave it three stars because the place was clean , the food was ok and the staff was well informed to cater to the customer. Just a piece of mind , In and Out has a way better burger."}
{"text":"I had the CEO and it delivered!! It was done just right and The buns are amazing too. We were a huge group of 7 and everyone was satisfied with their purchase. So good."}
{"text":"Good, quick place to grab a burger. Try the alternative style burger or fries off the secret menu. They add this great molten glob of cheese, sauces, & onions, and it is decadent!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I came here when it was only their 2nd day of being open which may explain the slow service.  Took us 20 minutes to get 2 burgers which isn't horrible but for a fast food type establishment, it's a bit slow.  The hamburgers were ok..a bit small for the price and not very flavorful.  I got the Parmesan French fries which were a bit disappointing, but my husband got the onion rings and I think I liked them best out of everything!  We will give it another try because we did like the Atmosphere, the friendly customer service, and the fact that they sold Santan brewery beer."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever tasted.  Juicy tasty and the double cheese burger was around $5.77 and its 100% black Angus beef.  Current special is from 2 pm to 5 pm is a double cheese burger junior fry and beverage for $10.  I just can't get over the prices after reading the reviews with pricey in them.  Fry's were very good and not frozen and could easily served 2 people.  Will be going back again.  Customer service was also very good."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries, came around 1230 on a Thursday afternoon, wasn't too busy got my order right in and came out quick. And beer!"}
{"text":"In town checking out ASU and needed some fuel and this place is literally across the street and SO glad we decided to stop it! WOW, is the first thing to come to mind when I was staring at the menu trying really hard to decide what I wanted as the options were soooooo amazing I couldn't decide!!! The fact that it's just burgers, fries and it's so hard because of the selection should tell ya that this place is a gem!  I went with the conflicted burger and cry-frys with garlic aioli topping.......YAS!!! They also serve beer and wine and I can only imagine how busy this place is during the school day!  Excellent customer service, they offer a student discount as well and the shakes are to die for! We had the special which was a Pumpkin cheescakes concoction of some sort!?!!  Really wish they one of these places locally here in the PNW, it would do amazing!"}
{"text":"Can I give this place six stars?!? Amazing burgers, great selection of local beers. Fast service. Did I mention amazing burgers? It is pricy for sure, but when it is an absolutely amazing experience, it's worth it. The CEO burger has Wagyu and Brisket in it. Mouth watering goodness. Expect to pay about $9 for the burger and sides are extra. Garlic Parmesan fries were pretty good. Interesting side note on the new Tempe location, literally every single person working stopped to make sure I was enjoying the food, to clean the table of stray clutter, and to generally thank me for coming in. You don't see that very often from everyone in the entire store. Maybe it sounds exhausting, but it actually seemed genuine.  Maybe it's because it's a fairly new location, but I hope that focus on customer service excellence continues. I've never had a bad experience at the Mesa/Gilbert location, but they definitely didn't go out of their way to make sure I was enjoying myself. (spoiler alert, I was still enjoying myself)  Go into this place expecting a good burger and knowing the pricing is higher and you will be happy. Expect a cheap meal and you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I decided to visit BurgerFi when I had a craving for a burger. I went at an off hour, so it wasn't very crowded but there were still a few people inside enjoying their lunches. The staff at the register was very friendly, but he seemed new at his job. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with white cheddar and an onion ring on top, as well as an oh my chocolate concrete. My food was ready in only a few minutes and I took it to go. I should have checked my food before I left because when I opened up the package I got a regular cheeseburger with no bacon! Upon reviewing the attached receipt I saw that I was only charged for a regular burger and not for the bacon; the cashier must have made a mistake. He did seem like a new employee and it was an honest mistake, so I am willing to try BurgerFi again but I will check my order before I leave. The burger was delicious, although it could have been a little more flavorful. The onion ring on top was a nice touch, but expensive for only 1 onion ring ($1); I won't be ordering an onion ring next time I come here. I recommend the white cheddar, I'm glad I substituted it for the regular American cheese. The chocolate concrete was very rich and good, but I wish they had smaller sizes, it was huge! I put the leftovers in the freezer and it made for a good snack later. Overall, the food was good, but not anything to rave about. I am bummed that I didnt get the try a burger with bacon but I will probably return."}
{"text":"Went to BurgerFi at Portage for the first time with my 75 year old father. Right out of the gate, opened the door and got blasted with music!! The kid behind the counter had to ask us more than once to repeat our order. The gentleman in line in front of us said had to repeat himself as well. I asked the manager if it was at all possible to turn the volume down a little as I would like to not have to yell at my Dad through dinner. \"Well, it's corporate policy to have it that loud\".. to blow your ear drums out!  She was worried that someone from corp would walk in on a Tuesday at 5:30 pm, in Cuyahoga Falls, and she'd get in trouble!! HUH? Send him/her to me!!!  Isn't the customer always right? Oh...the owner was there as well and wouldn't look me in the eye, but he did turn the volume down, a little...but then back up some after we sat down to eat and the tables all around us moaned when he turned it up again. The manager did come over and check on us an apologize and continue to justify the loud music again. I'd have been more impressed if the manager-child would have done that. But that's neither here nor there.  The decor was very cool. The burgers and fries were very tasty...although too salty for my liking. The prices weren't awful. Can I get a better/bigger for the same or cheaper? Yup! Will I return? Probably, maybe, someday....don't know."}
{"text":"I visit Burger Fi about every other week for lunch.  The quality is up there.  The buns are always fresh and the variety is great.  Delicious burgers!  Today, their staff went above and beyond and I feel compelled to tell the world.  I brought only a visa gift card to pay and, even though it had a balance available, there machine wouldn't take it.  I expected to walk back to work without food but they went ahead and gave it for free!  Best burger ever!  By the way, I WILL come back tomorrow and insist on paying for it.  And I can't say that this is their policy (maybe they know I visit regularly).  Regardless, 5 stars in my book.  Thanks Burger Fi!"}
{"text":"Got the veggie burger, which was nice and crispy - not your usual Morningstar Farms burger. The Cry & Fry onion rings and french fry combo was very generous - 3 huge onion rings and more than enough fries for two people. Next time, I'll probably just stick with the burger."}
{"text":"I ordered our Burgers on their website and it is actually the very first place that I have put our names on the orders that we wanted and they actually put our names on our orders absolutely wonderful Burgers they tasted amazing and the website was done so beautifully and so easy great great place we will continue to go there!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and casual. Stopped in for a quick bite, and it's a trendy burger place. The conflicted burger was good.. beef with a veggie burger,gotta try it. Flavor was good and large portion of fries. Prices could be a little better, but not bad."}
{"text":"Have you noticed the hip burger chain craze taking over America? I sure have and I'm trying out as many as I can. We're pretty lucky around here, in the sense that we don't have to go far to get a good burger. However, if you're strapped for time and can't do a nice sit-down place, you'll be faced with limited, horrible fast food options. You know what I'm talking about, I won't even utter the names. Burgerfi is one of the few places challenging how we think about fast burger joints. Just like Shake Shack, it's definitely a fast casual restaurant with a hip and fresh interior.  I enjoyed the Conflicted Burger which is both a natural angus burger and a veggie burger. It came with American and white cheddar cheese, burgerfi sauce  and the usual toppings. I went ahead and got it Green Style, which meant that instead of buns I got it wrapped in layers of lettuce. I highly recommend it it this way, especially if you're carb conscious or just want to look cool AF!. A side of fries are big enough to share between 2-3 people.  Overall, the the burger had a fantastic fresh and juicy taste. I hope that this chain continues to grow, and make it's way to the West Side."}
{"text":"Let me tell you why they get 5 stars.   THAT. VEGGIE. BURGER.  Oh my goodness. I never thought I would love a veggie patty so much. I usually will get the veggie burger wrapped in lettuce rather than the bun, it's a little messy, but so worth it.   They have one of those awesome soda machines that has, like, infinite options.   The fries are good. If you're getting fries, the orders of them are huge and can easily be shared by at least 3 people. The Cajun fries are yum.   The building is cute and modern. There is an outdoor patio which is nice for those beautiful Arizona evenings.  I love this place. Unfortunately it took me 3 years of living in my house right down the street to finally try it...but I'm certainly glad I did."}
{"text":"The conflicted burger is PERFECT for any burger lover who loves veggie patties but loves angus beef.   Who knew angus and veggie patties would mesh so well together?  If you want to actually get more flavor out of your burger, go for green style (no bread - wrapped in lettuce) it gives it a much fresher and crisp taste.   Fries are pretty bomb - not usually a fan of hand-cut fries but in this case I'm gonna say go for it - especially if you get the Cajun seasoning on it.   Warning: Regular size fries are more than enough for two."}
{"text":"Ordered via Postmates today for a work lunch and two orders were missed. I could not reach a live person at Postmates so I called the location and the manager had an employee drive our missing items to us so everyone could enjoy lunch. Super nice of them since it was really up to Postmates to check the order. This location is awesome :)"}
{"text":"I have no idea why burger fi is not 5 stars on here. It is the best burger I have ever had. Trust me! I'm a foodie I've eaten \"best burgers\" in other states from the food network (ex:Charm city burger in south Florida) and this is my favorite burger ever ( even over my Kobe meat burgers) I get the 28 aged brisket. Worth $10! The onion rings are crunchy. The fries are fresh and just right. Not to greasy. The black and white shake is rich and satisfying! The workers are always willing to help and seem to like to be here. I will not eat a burger anywhere else. It's a let down. Such great quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Best burgers on this planet not joking it puts the mr krabs crab shack to shame. The service was also on point very friendly"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a burger! It's about $10/burger and they have a variety of toppings you can get on it. I got the original cheeseburger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had (or maybe I was just really hungry lol jk). The meat is super tender and melts in your mouth. I had swiss cheese on my burger which was a nice/unique option. Their fries were really good, too, tasted like real sliced potatoes with the skins still on. I wish they would have been more crispy, but  that's just my personal preference. One of my favorite things about the place was the atmosphere. It's super modern and trendy and spacious, and the fact that you can place your order on a user-friendly tablet screen was a cool feature instead of having to wait in line and talk to a real person!"}
{"text":"GREAT burgers and fried and GREAT milkshakes. They also serve alcoholic beverages. Their burger options come in some pretty off-the-wall ways, but I think thats what makes it so great. VERY pricey for a burger place, but its worth trying for sure."}
{"text":"i went on the grand opening.  the line was long, but its a new restaurant, that should be expected. i ordered a build your own burger, a drink and Parmesan and herb frys. the frys were amazing. the burger was so juicy good. they taste like a better 5 guys burger. the down side is the burgers were small and its a tad pricey for the size of the burger. will i be back? of course, but i wont be there as much since its kind of expensive."}
{"text":"Food quality is good, portion size is smaller for the burger itself, not worth the $7-$10 price just for a burger, 5 guys is better bang for the buck in my opinion. The atmosphere is nice and they stay fairly clean inside."}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight for something quick but better than fast food.  Our food was delicious as it always is, but we have just a small complaint.  During the summer a combo was $7.97 which included drink, fry and an onion ring.  Today the combo was $8.97 so we figured it went up a dollar, no biggie.  When the food was ready, we noticed no onion rings.  We asked and the girl behind the counter said they don't do onion ring any more on the combo. My husband said simply \"that's weird, no onion ring but price went up\". The  girl then replied \"I don't make the rules, I just work here\".  We were taken aback by that and went and sat down.  There was no need for a snarky remark from that girl.  Better training in regards to customer service might be helpful.  We will be back, but it will be their last chance to make it right"}
{"text":"I have visited several times, and never had a bad experience. It is up to par with most similar burger places, where you order at the counter but it is still fast food.  My highlights that bring me here over similar burger resturants are: the lettuce wraps, lemonades, and I really love love the salt and vinager fries. I couldn't pass up these fries they are seriously yummy. But burgers are tasty, nothing over the top amazing, nothing to really complain about either. My daughter and boyfriend really love the frozen custard as well. ( I'm lactose intolerant of I would try it)"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. We went in for drinks and had the best bartender! He was so personable and fun and made our night. Thanks Desmond, we will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Neat place. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Better than 5 Guys. Better than Red Robin. Probably better than Swensons.  They have beer on draft too! They're a little pricey, but it's worth it. You can even dine out on the street and people/car watch. Will be back again and again! Watch out for the Big Ass fan!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Better than McDonald, onion ring big and fresh. Saw good review on Yelp, many college students. Good location."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here for the first time after classes on Friday. The restaurant is new and clean. We ordered at the front with Jacy, who was friendly and extremely helpful as she gave us suggestions for burgers to try. I ordered a regular bacon cheeseburger and my friend had the quinoa crusted veggie burger which were both amazing. The burgers were enormous and very tasty. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Red Velvet Concrete? Meh.   Burgers? YASS. Husband loves the BAD burger.   Fries? Nom.  Get them urban style.   Onion rings are ginorm. Get the Cry & Fries if you want both."}
{"text":"Probably the best veggie burger I've ever had!! The restaurant is close to campus and super nice inside; also very clean. Their onion rings are also to DIE for. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Quick service and tasty burgers.  The burgers seem kinda small, but the fries make up for it.  Custard is too expensive."}
{"text":"I mean, I would go back if it was my only option. It's just not that good and the nerve to charge the prices that they do. The people who work there are kind though."}
{"text":"We hopped on over to BurgerFi because we are all about trying new places...especially in and around Dana Park. Our experience was as aptly as the 3* review gives A-OK. Nothing special, but nothing terrible either.  Pros: * The veggie burger...really great. * The drink machine...I love these things, so I am always thrilled when any place has them. * Decor is cool and modern.  Cons: * It took FOREVER to get our food. There had to be 20 people working this particular evening (guessing that it was training since it was their first week open?) and it took about 25 minutes to receive our food after the order was placed. * They gave us one tray with three meals on it. One tray. No extra trays so we can separate our food out and not spill food all over the table (and ourselves). The burgers are only half wrapped, so you definitely NEED somewhere to place your food on other than the table. * No silverware. I know, i know, it's a burger joint. But I like to cut my food up when I eat it, especially if it' messy. I don't want to have to pick at things with my fingers after half of it has fallen out of the bun. * Not a very friendly staff. My expectations may have been a little high, because I assume that opening week you want to really lay the kindness and excitement on as thick as possible. Not that anyone was rude, but I would appreciate a \"Welcome to BurgerFi! Let me explain the BurgerFi process to you! Glad you came in to see us during out first week!\"  We may come back and try again after the kinks get worked out. I will update my review then."}
{"text":"I don't really eat burgers much but i do love their veg burger :) yes size is small but for a small Asian girl it's enough ! Especially with their huge onion rings .  I feel that ingredients are fresh and since most burgers make me sick (example zips soaked in oil burger) I prefer that over quantity . If your the quality over quantity type it's for u, if u have no problem finishing couple Big Macs , it'll be a very pricey burger for u lol   Over all I like it , don't really care for their fries or their frozen treats though ."}
{"text":"BurgerFi is the Pizzafire of burger places. You get a selection of burgers to choose from (and now hotdogs), but you can customize them. The burgers are pretty big and the fries closely resemble 5guys. The selection of burgers and sides is unique and pretty large (for burgers). They recently got a veggie burger that looks so good. You can also customize your fries and sides as well. Since it's a higher-end burger joint, it is a little more pricey. So I wouldn't suggest them for a night when you want a quick, cheap burger. This is the place you take out-of-towners for an above average burger."}
{"text":"Quality food and quality service.. i would say they cook all their burgers medium rare(ish) so if you like it your burger well done I'd suggest you ask. But for a low key burger place.. this place is great. It's a classier fast food joint. I just wanted a better burger than mcdonalds so i stopped in here and received the best hospitality ever... i waited an average time to receive my food and the expo was super generous. He offered me a free drink on the house and by the time i filled my drink up my food was done. It's not the absolute best burger I've ever had but it's not like a fast food burger either. But since the service was amazing i know I'll be back in."}
{"text":"I grew up in Cuyahoga Falls, and haven't been back since the whole plaza was built - I was pleasantly surprised by Burgerfi. It's got a great atmosphere and design, and the burgers are pretty good. I really like the concept of the restaurant, and that they use fresh ingredients. The sauces that you can order with the fries are delicious and addictive, especially the garlic aoli! Definitely one of the better spots in the area, and I plan to keep coming back when I visit."}
{"text":"For the price, I expected a big, tasty burger.  Instead, it was really small and average tasting.  The fries were good, but they charged extra for vinegar, which is ridiculous.  The music inside was obnoxiously loud, so we sat outside, even though it was hot and humid.  In Mentor, there are too many other places to get better burgers for less, without having to listen to music that's turned up to 11."}
{"text":"Back again and can't believe I've waited so long to return. The burgers are still amazing! I'll be back but not going to wait so long this time.  To the gorgeous man and his daughter, thank you for the great advice"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful soon enough it was our first visit. Beer on tap is a great deal $2 with a purchase on Thursdays. We had a cheeseburger and fries. Burgers were big and juicy, like homemade and filled me up. As for the Fries they seemed to be made fresh and not fried out of a bag. Wait time was about 5 minutes with no lines. I could just imagine how long we would wait if it was a packed house. Anyways, the best part about this place is the staff."}
{"text":"Giving it a two star because the place is decent and clean. The cashier kept on asking the same question , her accent was so thick that we couldn't understand her. She kept on asking me if I wanted the veggie burger when I ordered the French fries.. Then when it's time to give us the change she gave us the wrong change. She gave us $1 back instead of $5. Then she had to get the shift lead and reopen the drawer and she took a long time to figure out the correct change. Hire someone that can actually speak English and that doesn't come to work hung over."}
{"text":"Super excited to try the burgers, after numerous friends at work sang their praises. Nope. Not worth the money. Well Correction- the onion rings were awesome! But the burgers were tough/chewy and the toppings were not as special as they advertised.  Even the teenage son passed on finishing my burger. Oh well."}
{"text":"I would have given a 2.5 ....its not a full 3, but not as bad as a 2 star.    We went to BURGERFI at around 8 PM and Sat after some mall shlepping.  The place looks fresh, new and very clean,  It does have a B-Spot vibe ...(I'll never go back to B-spot)   The girl that took the order was helpful and pleasant.   There's a mind blowing menu of things to choose from, a little hard to see with glaring lights on the flat screens :(   I had a double burger, no cheese with tomato and lettuce with some no salt fries. The other half had a single with jalapeno pepper and neon relish and pickles.  She also had lettuce and tomato but didn't know you have to ask for it ....the staff was quick to respond with a side for her to add.  The lettuce and tomato's  were VERY fresh and crisp !!  The other half said the peppers and relish were awesome.  The mountain of fries were crisp, hot, and salt free as requested.  The burger itself is where it all went flat .....no pun interned, but its really flat, like smashed flat. The bun is toasted, but crushed a bit where they \"brand\" it with \"BURGERFI\"  a novel touch, but would have preferred it not been crushed.  The burger wasn't bad, but I'll be honest, its tiny and  nothing more than a Steak-N-Shake style burger ....and taste just like it !!!   For 20 bucks for 2 people,  I would have expected a larger burger ....even after my double and 90% of the fries, I left hungry :(    Other things...if you like reading?  The tables are low and the chairs are HORRIBLE ...They're cold, hard uncomfortable and LOUD !!  There was about 15 people in there and the chairs moving on the floor, was nails like nails on a chalkboard ....OK, maybe not that bad, but close. The table cleaning guy didn't help matters as he shuffled each and every freakin chair out and in again.   The floors are raw concrete?  I don't know what architect out there is pushing this, but its ugly,dirty and unfinished looking.  So far, Walmart, Walgreen's and the new Advance auto in Easlake all have raw (polished) concrete floors, spend the money, put some tile down folks!  The place is very loud, its all metal and hardwood, is a cool look but  there is NOTHING to absorb noise. With the football game on and people yelling, I couldn't get out of there fast enough.   Over all its not \"bad\"  but its not cheap !! Like I said, its a Steak-N-Shake with better fries.  I would say dollar for dollar, RED-Robin is a better value. But if you want squished flat burgers, Steak-n-Shake or Burgerfi will do the trick ....except Burgerfi is going to cost you more!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Burger Fi twice, now, and I haven't been particularly impressed.  The Food: They only offer two options for vegetarians that are not sides. Whenever I go (mostly when family is visiting) I'm forced to order the same thing. It would be nice if they at least offered a salad or something, for a lighter meal option. The saving grace was that the quinoa burgers actually taste really good!  The Service: When we walked in the cooks did a little sing-song greeting, which was nice. But then my family and I were figuring out who was on who's ticket and the cashier interrupted us (we were only talking for probably 30 seconds) and tried to delegate who was on what ticket. We all stared at her in disbelief. She then proceded to try and tell us that no, we didn't want to order what we ordered, we actually wanted something else (about our drinks, fries, and burgers). I finally had to tell her to stop and that we would order what we wanted. Another cashier got up and took the people from the back of the line, when there were obviously two groups ahead of them.  The Atmosphere: The music here is SO LOUD. We can barely hear each other talking, and that's the people in our group without hearing aides. Please, please, please turn the music down! The decor and seating are also pretty cool.  All in all, it would not bother me if I never returned, but it wouldn't kill me, either."}
{"text":"There's a vegan option 'VegeFi' really good Will come back to try out the rest of their menus."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, I could see making this place a habit easily.  My friend and I finally got to check this place out.  The place was very clean and has a modern look & feel.  You can walk up to the counter and order or it appeared that you could place your own as well.  We opted for the counter, in case we had questions, since this was our first time.  The girl/lady at the counter was very friendly and acknowledged us immediately.  We ordered a bacon cheese burger (single) and a CEO (single) along with the Cry & Fries Urban Style (Garlic Aioli & Grated Parmesan).  My friend like her burger and I definitely like my selection.  The burger had so much flavor and cooked well.  Now, the Cry & Fries, was AMAZING!!!!  I could easily make a meal out that...  Yes, they are a bit higher than some of the national fast food chains, but quality is so much better and cannot be compared.  Their drink station is one of those Soda Kiosks...so you have tons of selections from brand products.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Tried the CEO burger! Fresh cut fries, and thick chocolate shake! Service is over the top, they really know how to treat their customers! Very clean dining! Good for vegans, good for me too! Next time I'll try the fries with toppings! Kinda pricey but worth the money! Great experience! 5 plus stars!!!!"}
{"text":"BurgerFi is a nice addition to the burger scene here in Tempe. I got the BurgerFi Cheeseburger, and it was quite filling; it comes with two patties by default  One thing that stands out are the buns. You'd be amazed at how much the burger bun can make or break a burger. This one was a soft and fluffy bun, and I thought it really complimented the beefy tasting patties.  One thing to note is that the Large Fries are REALLY LARGE. You could share with 4 ppl and be fine.   OH, the onion rings!! I usually only kinda-like onion rings, but MAN these are making me reconsider. They're THICK, soft and crunchy. When you bite them, they don't have that stringy membrane that's hard to bite through causing the whole onion to slide out of the fried batter. They have quite the amazing taste  TRY EM.   It was a pretty good and solid regular tasting burger. It's a bit pricey though :| but I will definitely come back every once in awhile when I want a burger other than one from In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"First of all, there was a hair in my burger... I had to cut that piece of my burger out to finish.  Ruined my appetite.  The air conditioning wasn't working properly so it wasn't much of a relief from the summer heat inside. And they had signs up promoting their \"BBQ summer burger,\" but when I ordered it, the employee told me \"I'm sorry but we haven't started serving that yet.\"  Then take your signs down that are all over your restaurant advertising it!  And don't call it a summer burger if it's the middle of summer and you haven't even started serving it.   This was my first time eating here and it will most definitely be my last.  Next time I'll be sure to go to Five Guys directly across the street!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice, probably the nicest I have seen for any burger place. My burger was very good and the fries are fresh cut, which always taste better in my opinion."}
{"text":"The manager of this location contacted me and gave my partner and me a free meal for our past experience. This time, the service was great, and the food was fantastic. They really made the situation right, which is very admirable in a company. Four stars for an awesome experience, the fifth will be for consistency going forward. This time, I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Here's a novel idea, don't sell me something you don't have, come after me at the soda station to semi apologize, and then ONLY refund me that burger. Sales 101, that's not good business. In case anyone is wondering why this place is always empty, there's one idea."}
{"text":"Burgerfi's food is excellent but their portions do not match their prices whatsoever. Their cashiers are very nice and it's really cool that they bring you your food based on what placemat you put your buzzer on. The restaurant has a cool design, good music, and lots of tvs which gives it a nice modern feel.   One thing that rubbed me the wrong way was in a previous visit, the cashier asked my girlfriend if she wanted to try a seasoning on her fries but never informed us there would be an extra charge. The added cost was so significant we never would have agreed to it and the seasoning didn't contribute enough to the fries to justify the purchase.   All in all it's a really nice place. Just way too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to BurgerFi. The bacon cheeseburgers were delicious and juicy. The onion rings were incredible. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"i love love love their beyond burgers! if you get it without mayo cheese and switch to whole grain bun it's 100% vegan! ask them for the vegan style. the guy with the green tips in his hair in my favorite! he's so friendly!"}
{"text":"BurgerFi was a pleasant surprise. We were there about 4:30 and it was quiet. We walked up and ordered and got our buzzers. We grabbed a table on the patio and a few short minutes later our food was ready. The burgers were awesome. I had the CEO and my wife had a basic double burger. They were cooked perfectly. The CEO had a great jam/aioli combo that popped when you bit into the burger. The onion rings bursted with flavor through the light batter. The fries were seasoned well and had some good meat on them. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here late one night on our drive home back from Vegas. I had a craving for a burger and we decided to try this place. We ordered two burgerfi cheeseburgers, & large fries. My boyfriend got the m&m concrete and I got a peanut butter shake. We spent close to 30$ for the two of us. The burgers themselves were good, my boyfriend did not like the burgerfi sauce. But I enjoyed it. The fries were ok and we ordered a large but really could have just ordered a regular, we didn't finish even half of them. I enjoyed my shake though I like icebergs shakes better, and my boyfriend didn't like his concrete.  We ate outside and the patio area is nice and clean. While we were waiting for our food I cracked a joke that we could have went to wendys for half the price. After the meal my boyfriend said he probably would have liked wendys better. Overall OK not something I think we will repeat though."}
{"text":"First time eating here today at lunch.  Portion sizes were big for the money.  Best burger I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"When did it become appropriate to charge $18 for a Burger?!  I mean it was presented well. But I can't justify spending this much for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I've read an article about this place. So decided to give this place a visit.  Decor is nice, and cozy.  Interior is well designed.  I ordered burgerfi burger, and onion rings.  Burger was decent, bread was soggy, and tomato was fresh.  I didn't taste anything unique about the burger.  Onion ring was massively big! It was big as my burger.  Initial bite was good, then it started to get tired of eating the onion rings. Too greasy and not as crispy like traditional onion rings.    Price is not cheap.  So don't expect in-n-out burger price range.    Overall, food was okay.  Not impressive enough for me to drive the distance to visit. Five guys burger is cross the street and it seemed they were little more busier than this place. For the money I would rather go Zinburger.  That's just me."}
{"text":"Great burgers, Great fries. Breakfast burger was the best and vegan burger is one of the best around. Try it!"}
{"text":"I like this place but feel that it's overpriced for what you receive. If you order your burger as a single, it's a small patty. Probably about the size of an In N Out patty but with more toppings. However, it's priced so much higher than a single from In N Out - like 3 times the price.   That being said, I do enjoy their different offerings. I've tried the bacon cheeseburger, CEO, etc. and they're all tasty. I also like their veggie burger but their multigrain buns are not great so when I order the veg burger, I ask for their regular bun.   Their Urban Fries are really really good if you like parmesan and garlic. I also like dipping their regular fries in their truffle aioli.   Overall, it's average. I go occasionally. I prefer Zinburger but BurgerFi is the happy medium (price-wise) between places like In N Out and places like Zinburger."}
{"text":"Extremely small burgers for price. Taste pretty good but nothing special. First time I went to a restaurant and left hungry. I made my own burger, so it was a single slice. Maybe comparable to in n out. I'm appreciative of the return feedback from the restaurant so I'm editing my review. I did not realize the healthiness of the meat, which is a big deal to me and explains the price. I might go back for a second time to try a larger burger. The price makes sense to me if we are talking healthy. Thank you burger-fi for being concerned. I was surprised to get a reply from you."}
{"text":"We are burger snobs... we think this is a good place to get a tasty and healthier burger - Highly recommend!! Not sure why many have complained about the service - we found everyone to be very friendly, helpful and patient, as we looked over the menu trying to figure out what we wanted."}
{"text":"Amazing the food is made to order and it truly was delicious. I had the CEO which is a wage/ brisket blended burger with Double Wagyu + Brisket Blend Burger, Homemade Candied Bacon-Tomato Jam, Truffle Aioli, Aged Swiss Cheese. The flavor of the burger was incredible and to top it off they offer fresh hand cut French fries."}
{"text":"Frick'n awesome!!! The CEO is awesome.  The chili dog is spicy... ***Double thumbs up*** My new favorite burger place. The frys are so good..."}
{"text":"Love everything about this restaurant. Service is wonderful and the food is amazing! Love the branded buns!!! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"My first time at BurgerFi was a successful, despite it being only their second day open. I set the bar low, expecting relative chaos, but was pleased to find that even with a line out the door, the staff of BurgerFi seemed to have everything under control. The service was fast & friendly, & the food was delicious.  Overall, the wait was about the same as if you went into a sit-down restaurant, ordered with a server, & then waiting on your food to come out to you. I assume that once the novelty has worn off, the lines won't be quite so long & the overall experience will go much more quickly, but the lines moved pretty fast, even on day two, so if you're hungry & impatient, don't necessarily be scared off.   I've seen/heard a lot of complaints about BurgerFi's prices, & my solution for those people is simple: If you think BurgerFi is too expensive, eat elsewhere. But let the rest of us have this one damn thing, OK? It's great to have see an organic fast-casual joint settle in town, & BurgerFi is a nice alternative to the greasy burgers at Five Guys & the questionable meat at McDonald's.   Order a burger or hot dog creation off the menu or, starting at $5.45, create your own. Healthier options are also available - quinoa burger, chicken apple dog, lettuce in place of buns, etc. A host of their toppings (onions, jalapenos, etc.) are free/included, & others (chili, onion rings, etc.) are available for an added charge ($1 for everything but bacon, which is $1.57). Fries & onion rings are not included & thus cost extra; they, too, come in a variety of styles & with accoutrements like cheese, chili, parmesan & garlic, etc. I loved their plain fries with cheese sauce on the side, but I can't say I'll return to their onion rings, which are each the size of my face & pretty impossible to eat. As an apropos-of-nothing note, their BBQ sauce is fantastic, & you should try to create a burger that includes it.  The staff seemed to be on the ball & incredibly friendly, keeping the line moving & the restaurant clean. I'm glad to see BurgerFi in town & hope they do well here."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our first try at BurgerFi. We knew it would be busy on their day 2 of being open and they were already easily found online so that we could view the menu and call in an order. Oddly both decided to try the hotdogs on the menu. I had the Texas chili cheese dog with their fresh cut fries and my wife had the Chicago style dog also with fries.   They were both amazing in our opinion and the fries were excellent! They handled my to go order very quickly and in a friendly manner. Even with how busy they were I was able to walk in, pay and walk back out food in hand.  As far as price goes, I think they are reasonable for the quality and style of food. It's definitely NOT McDonald's fast food. If that's what you want do not come here. If you want REAL burgers and good hotdogs then try BurgerFi. One thing we knew before ordering here was that they server All natural burgers. We will repeat this location and give them a try because that was one thing that we were really drawn in by in the first place.   Overall great experience and recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"Don't bother.  The place is obviously an imitation of Five Guys, but no nearly as good.  The burgers taste pretty good, but not great, and are more like loose piles of meat than nice patties.  The buns were soggy messes.  The toppings were OK, though the grilled onions were tasteless, but they are not very generous and were not put on evenly.   The service ranged from slightly-annoyed-to-be-there to oblivious.  And it is too expensive for what you get.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Oh BurgerFi, you slay me.   The burgers are fantastic. You can get a combo plate of their fries and HUGE onion rings, instead of buying each one a la carte. The quality is totally there.  The lack of a star doesn't go to the quality, it goes to the price. I was shocked to hear the total on 2 burgers and a combo side of fries and onion rings. The price of good food is usually a little on the higher side, so I'm not too upset about it. I devoured that burger (and let me tell you, they are huge) in an instant. I will definitely be going back, as it is an amazing product."}
{"text":"So I noticed that this was a new place and wanted to give it a try. I ordered the burger fi burger. When I received my order, I thought, \"damn, what a small burger for the amount of money it is. I could have gone to In & Out burger.\" When I bit into the burger, I was surprised that there was no onion on it (I like onion on my burger). I also was bummed that cheese was not included on it and it is something that you have to pay extra for. So I am sitting there already annoyed because of these factors and looking at their paper menu. Come to find out by reading the take home menu, that, you can add two extra free toppings! hmmmmm, why didn't the girl who took my order ask me if I wanted to add two extra FREE toppings?!! Wait, there is more. Soooo, the burger that I had said that here was some sort of special \"burger fi\" sauce... I could not even tell you what that tasted like because I could not even taste it on my burger. Overall, I was disappointed and was wishing that I went to In & Out burger as it is, sadly, waaaaay better!! In conclusion, I give this place 2 stars. If you want a good burger, go to Zin Burger or Hop Daddy Burger bar! or In & Out if you are looking for something quick!"}
{"text":"I walked in at 6:00 pm today to see if it was busy so I could grab my family some custard on the way home to try out. It wasn't very busy (3 in line for food and 1 in line for custard) so I hopped in the \"fast\" line for custard and waited. And waited. And waited. The cashier working the \"fast\" line walked away and never came back. After the 3 people were helped in the slow line the cashier there started helping the people in the fast line. The guy in front of me went first, then I was called up, and right after they opened a new register and called the woman behind me up at the same time. My cashier couldn't get my order right (2 chocolate shakes, a jr vanilla custard with rainbow sprinkles, and a jr swirl custard with chocolate syrup and rainbow sprinkles). As a result, the woman behind me with 6 custard orders got hers in before me. Before I went to pay I asked my cashier what the wait would be. She turned to asked the one guy working the custard and he said \"I'm almost done with this order and the next will take 5-10 minutes.\" I tell the cashier I am going to the gas station next door and I'll be back in 5. I come back 5 minutes later and I sit down. Again, it is not busy. I glance up and there is still only one guy working the custard. I waited. And waited. And waited. Finally the order was ready. I grabbed it and got into my car and the clock read 6:55 pm. I checked my receipt and the time stamp is 6:15. No exaggeration, it took 55 minutes to get two shakes and two kids ice cream cups including waiting in line. Again, IT WAS NOT BUSY!   The custard was good, but there's no way Id go back. If they took that long for custard I can't imagine the wait time on food. I have two young kids and Im not willing to wait double or triple the time we'd wait at a full service restaurant for any other similar establishment. My money is hard earned and I prefer it to spend it at a place that values my time."}
{"text":"I decided to finally take the 25 mile drive over to Mesa to give BurgerFi a try.  The decor suited me well, completely uncluttered.  Everything there had a function.  Many places try to over sensationalize the burger joint.  I ordered the basic BurgerFi Cheeseburger, onion rings, and a soda.  They have the modern soda system that allows you to choose any one of dozens of flavors.  They even had vanilla Root Beer.  I enjoyed a mixture of Cherry Vanilla Coke and Root Beer.  It was well blended, a well tuned machine.  The onion rings...  I'm not sure what to say about the onion rings, except that next time I visit I'll go with the fries.  You get about 6 onion rings, and I can't imagine a person that can eat all 6.  I'm a big guy, was really hungry, and could only eat 3.  6 would be nearly an entire onion.  They were cooked perfectly, and tasted good, but they're just too much onion for me.  The burger was good.  By far it wasn't the best burger I've had, but again, it was well prepared and cooked to perfection.  It lacked the flavor that you get with premium ground beef.  They are nearly exactly the same size as a 5 Guys burger - smallish double stacks.  Among the fast casual burger places, this would sit in the top tier.  Not a competitor with CBCB or even Red Robin.  On par with a good Wendy's or In n Out.  Better than Culver's.  I guess the issue comes down to price.  My simple meal was $15.28.  That is pretty steep.  Double what I would have spent at Wendy's or In n Out.  The soda system is expensive, as is the location and quality tables as well as table service, so I understand the cost.    Great place for groups - they have 2 tables that would seat about 16 people each.  I will drive the 25 miles again to visit BurgerFi, and maybe with fries instead of the onion rings I will upgrade this to a 4 star review."}
{"text":"Great burger!  Fries weren't my favorite, but the onion rings were great.  I had the bacon cheeseburger and I loved that I could pick my condiments and veggies when placing my order.  Nice spot!"}
{"text":"The burgers were good, but nothing special. Pretty greasy, similar to fast food. The atmosphere and concept is pretty cool, though. All-natural Angus burgers, craft beer, milkshakes, and more. I'll probably return, but I was expecting a higher quality burger. For two people, we spent $25 (2 burgers, 1 regular fry, 2 beers).  There are plenty of options, so I'd say it's worth checking it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Love this burger place! I just get a normal bacon cheeseburger and it's so good and juicy. My husband gets their breakfast one and it's his absolute favorite. They have great onion rings too!"}
{"text":"The Good:. The quality of the meat is  .  I mean that is there thing and as a result any burger you get will be a tasty burger  The Bad: while it's a good menu I feel like they are missing some a homerun go to menu item.    Other then that...I guess the prices?  I mean it's more then a typical burger joint but you knew that coming in as you wanted quality right?  Overall I'd recommend"}
{"text":"Went here to eat and I have to say although the food was good and the service not too bad I doubt that we would be back! Two cheese burgers and one French fry(even though I asked for two and the cashier insisted that I only wanted to have one because they were big) still wanted a second ff! The price was not worth the value that we received!!  Got a response back from Burgerfi after posting this. Appreciated but still too high priced for my families budget!"}
{"text":"The best veggie burger I've had on the East Side, by far. Make sure you add grilled onions and the neon relish for extra flavor. I always get the urban style fries...soooo good."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this restaurant.   For $18.00 , we got 2 burgers, 1fry, 1soft drink.   Afterwards, I thought, I could of had a Big Mac  meal, and been just as happy.  Too over priced in my opinion.   I won't go there again."}
{"text":"Burgers were very good but small. Pricey, but decent value. Wait times are long due to everything being fresh."}
{"text":"This place good! Great atmosphere. Very clean, decorated in a very inviting way. Staff very friendly and helpful. The onion rings are soooo good. Great burgers. I'm going to try a hot dog next time. This is a must try"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during the week, i had heard great things about this place from many people.  I ordered the cheeseburger, which came with 2 patties, american cheese, lettuce, tomato and special sauce. I also added pickles.  Ordered the Cry and Fry which is onion rings and french fries, the fries are cooked in 100% peanut oil and there were multiple ways to add toppings to your fries such as chili and cheese, salt and vinegar, and parmesan. Since it was my first visit i decided to go with trying them just as they come. I was happy to see all the options they had for beverages: beer, coke products; including the old school coke out of the bottle, milk shakes, and other bottled beverages.   After placing my order i was given a buzzer and within 10 minutes or less i had my order in front of me.  The burger was delicious, cooked perfect, and the lettuce, tomato and pickles were fresh and of decent size.  I also enjoyed the special sauce which was not over powering and the perfect addition to my burger. I was a little hesitant since the cheese burger came with 2 patties, but their employee assured me it wasnt too big.  she was correct. perfect size.  The onion rings are HUGE, they only gave me 3 with my half and half order but seeing the size i understand, the onion rings are fries were cooked perfect and very good.   BurgerFi also serves custard, chocolate and Vanilla which you can order as a concrete, milkshake, sundae, cone or cup. I tried just a cup and it was so creamy and rich, but very good. Im glad i didn't add any toppings and kept it plain for my first time, adding anything would have made this overly rich and too much after my burger and fries. I will definitely be returning to this burger place and will be telling all my friends!  Also have to mention how clean and friendly the staff was, great experience!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious. The burgers, fries, onion rings, veggie burger, conflicted burger...I've tried so many things and have not once been disappointed!  I thoroughly enjoy the cry and fry. An order of fries with onion rings on the top!  My gut can only handle so many onion rings so a full order is out of the question. Sign up for the text messages if you want to save some money!"}
{"text":"Burger Fi is my favorite burger place in Mesa.  Fabulous juicy burgers, excellent fresh condiments, really great fries, and onion rings to die for."}
{"text":"As a halal guy, there are two options for veggie. I had tried the Vegefi burger. Was an okay. Those who can eat non-halal food would enjoy this restaurant.  The place is nice and it is near to ASU. I would like to see more options for veggie burgers, or even fish burgers."}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot, food is great but the service is horrible, and they apparently don't know how to make a simple bacon cheeseburger..."}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying that my wife and I have ordered from burgerfi roughly a half of a dozen times. We continued giving them a try out of convenience, given the location. Well, convenience isn't selling this place for me anymore.   I've been waiting to review this place, in hopes that maybe once they'd get my order correct. Secondly, let me point out that these specialty orders are typically conducted over their online ordering system, where communication of the order is pretty straight forward, given the written word and all.  I'd be impressed if they were able to make a custom order correctly just once...  But that never came.   No more stops here out of convenience, that's for sure.   Not to sound too harsh, but I don't understand (or question, rather) how this place is maintaining profitability, given the prices and inconsistent (or in some cases, absent) positive qualities..."}
{"text":"Wife had the cheeseburger, I had the brisket burger and opted for BBQ sauce instead of blue cheese; it brought out the flavor in the brisket and made it more traditional of BBQ brisket. The cry & fries was a mix of onion rings and fries - HUGE RINGS!! Overall I was pleased although it was a bit pricey. Two burgers, two fries and two sodas cost me $32."}
{"text":"Such helpful employees that are friendly! We have been here a few times and the burgers are DELICIOUS!! Highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Very good Burgers. I had the burger Fi burger and the cry-fry. Frys are good, the Onion rings are literally some of the best Onion rings that I have ever had. Sincerely, dam good.  I also had a chili dog. I was a little skeptical to order a hot dog from a Burger joint. Surprised again, great tasting chilidog. I finished it off with a milkshake or concrete I think they call it. Really good, But hey, it's ice cream.  Who doesn't like ice cream.  You pay a little more, but worth it for the taste along.  The actual location is really nice and clean. Clean is is a must! All the servers were very nice as well. Will keep returning."}
{"text":"Great veggie burger!   Fries were freshly made.  Never seen my nieces finish their burgers before.  They polished their plates.  Such forward thinking has a kiosk put your order in and pay at the kiosk too!"}
{"text":"I've been to this particular location several times and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is awesome, good quality, and they even offer dessert. The staff is also very friendly and inviting.   I've been to many burger places across the country (LA-NY) and I'm so impressed with the taste and quality of the meat. The best burgers around. Although some people may not be willing to pay 5-7$ a burger, the quality that you're guaranteed is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Not sure why sum picky people gave bad reviews but the burgers were amazing! I had a vegifi (best vegi burger I've ever had btw) and every1 else in our group had breakfast burgers (they loved them) and we all shared a basket of fries. The fries are the bomb!! Gr8 atmosphere in this place. There are multiple TV's w sports on and cool lighting! Oh, the shakes are amazing 2 but huge so u may wanna share!!"}
{"text":"For a fast casual place and even for being in the burger chain category, this place is on point! I got the conflicted burger and let me tell you it was sooooo good. The conflicted burger has a veggie burger patty AND a meat patty (so clever) and both were seasoned well. You can't choose your burger temp but I didn't mind since it was so juicy and delicious. Even though the menu looks like you can only order a burger \"green style\" (aka with lettuce instead of buns) for the veggie burger, you can do it for any burger.   I also have the peanut butter milkshake which was super satisfying but it's more of a custard consistency. I didn't mind but do note if you're looking to have the milkshake consistency, it might take awhile for it to melt. The manager was super helpful and nice to us and overall this is just a great place to have casual meal. They even have alcohol and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"First of all we love this. Second, it was very expensive! 2 burgers, fries, onion rings and I Draft =$30. The burger were excellent, the fries with the parmesan herb topping were just to die for. I didn't love the onion rings, lots of people have raved about them but these were so LARGE I could not get my mouth around one to bit it. Just not my cup of tea. We will go again, prepared to spend that much money because we did enjoy it. Won't order the OR again but definitely the fries!"}
{"text":"Best gourmet burger joint period.  Quality is unmatched and the creative menu make this place new every time. This is a must if you enjoy burgers."}
{"text":"Went to Starbucks to see this amazing woman in my life right now, and on the way out I saw burgerfi. Didn't want a burger, just looked interesting. Walked in, it was nice, kinda hipster. Looked at the menu and decided to try one. Built my own, single patty, dbl mushroom, Swiss & cheddar, and garlic aoli... Lite Dijon. Got it to go. It was just under 10 bucks. Got home, opened the box and first thing I said out loud was \"awwww.. It's a wittle baby burger.\" Then I took a bite..  (FIREWORKS!!) it was absolutely amazing, and worth every penny I spent. The burger was cooked nicely and the mushrooms were fresh and crazy delicious. Can't wait to go back.   Ps.. You should make red onion-onion rings"}
{"text":"Got off the movie theater at 9pm so we decided to come here since they close at 10pm. The cashier was very pleasant and patient since it was our first time. We ordered the All day breakfast burger & the green style single burgerfi with a small fries & cajun seasoning on the side. When we got our food, my burger was not wrapped in lettuce so I asked to get some lettuce on the side, the manager was nice and said \"you can keep the burger and will make you a new one\" but I said \"no thank you, I'll just keep the burger\". He apologized and offered us some custard but in the end we didn't ask for it since we were full and it was late already. My experience with the customer service was great. The food was delicious but the size of the burger was a lil bit smaller than what we expected, my green style single burgerfi tasted fresh, my boyfriend's burger was also delish too, it was sweet and salty. Its got cheese, maple syrup, fried egg, bacon, grilled diced onion, ketchup and hashbrowns. The fries was a different story, I asked for a paper bag & dropped all the fries and cajun seasoning in the bag and shook it. Mmmmm so good! I will come back and try their urban fries with garlic aioli and also their custard."}
{"text":"Lo-fi, hi-fi, wi-fi, Burgerfi? I had eaten at the Mesa BurgerFi and had enjoyed their burgers so I was excited to see that there was a location in Tempe.   The dining area has both regular human-manned cashier registers and self-service kiosks behind the registers. After browsing through the menu, I ordered the conflicted burger, green style, and shared the cry+fry. You'll get a beeper after ordering, and if you get a soda they do have a Coca Cola Freestyle machine that offers a special lime flavor apparently exclusive to BurgerFi.   It didn't take too long for our orders to be made. Unlike other burger shops where their lettuce wrapped burgers are placed in a paper pouch to prevent everything from falling out, this burger was placed directly on a paper bowl with several leaves of iceberg lettuce instead of a bun. Initially picking it up was fine, and the crisp lettuce with the two burger patties was an excellent contrast of textures, temperatures and flavors but over time the uneven surface of the lettuce leaves would slide off the burger and the sauce ran all over my hands making for a wet dripping mess. I liked the contrast of the \"conflict\" in the conflicted burger: the veggie patty's slightly nutty, lightly crisp outer texture with soft filling was delicious with the primal taste of the beef patty.  The cry+fry was a very generous portion of onion rings and hand cut fries. The onion rings were gigantic and I liked the crunchy light batter but the onion itself was bland. I liked the fries better, which were lightly crispy.  Overall it was a pretty good experience and it's a good choice if you're looking for a delicious burger and fries."}
{"text":"A tasty spot for lunch! BurgerFi serves up burgers, fries, frozen custard, and hot dogs. In addition to beef burgers, they also have a delectable sounding brisket burger and a veggie burger made with quinoa.  Opting for a slightly healthier (Only slightly) route for lunch, I ordered the veggie burger. It was made in a fairly short amount of time, and tasted great. The burger was breaded and fried, which gave it a nice crunch to contrast with the softer quinoa. I tried some fries, which were perfectly cooked and delicious.  Service at the counter was friendly, and they have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine for your various flavored soda needs.   The menu also includes the caloric content of each item, so you can plan your exercise and diet regime accordingly. :)"}
{"text":"BurgerFi in Cuyahoga Falls, Oh is a very modern and fun restaurant in the new Portage Crossings shopping area. When walking in you will notice sleek stainless steel and posh wooden accents. The feel is youthful and hip, but not to the point where it is over done.  The menu features several burgers that have name like The Conflicted, The CEO, etc. They also have a build your own menu for burgers with lots of toppings and sauces. Their menu is not just limited to burgers, they also have got dogs, fries, onion rings and ice cream.  The burgers are excellent and I recommend the BurgerFi sauce (ketchup/mayo taste). The onion rings are huge and delicous. Nice thick onion that does not slide out of the breading when eaten. The fries are also epic and beware of the large order it is absurdly huge. I did like the cry fry option which is half and half onion ring/french fry.   I also tried the Chicago Dog. I will say I am particular about these and very critical of poor copies. The first mistake was splitting the dog open to grill. I hate this, as it just seems wrong. The dog has the correct ingredients but everything is slightly off. Tomato was meh, sport peppers were too few, relish was sub par, not enough mustard, too much celery salt etc. Poppy seed bun was also lacking. Overall this is a good hot dog, but far from an authetic Chicago dog.  Save for the Chicago dog, this is a great place. Will be back regularly."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the service my sister and I had was amazing.   The cashier was super patient with us since it was my first trip and I wanted basically \"a little\" of a lot of ingredients and the cashier never belittled me for that and was very, very friendly. After we ordered, we had the little buzzer that tells you when you're food is ready. Everything was self-serve in terms of napkins, drinks, and condiments. Our cashier came to our table with our food instead of us going to get it and he even asked if he could get us anything very kindly even though, like I said, the restaurant was self-served.   We both ordered the bacon cheeseburger with some of the additional free toppings. They do have \"premium\" toppings but those will be an additional cost. You know when you go to a fast food restaurant and you order a bacon burger, and they just lay like two tiny slices of bacon on your meat and call it a day? They do NOT skimp on the bacon. I didn't open it to see but I literally had nice crispy bacon in literally EVERY single bite- it was delicious. They do have a special sauce the burger comes in (Fi Sauce) but my sister said the bacon taste was strong and you would have tasted more of that than the normal cheeseburger. I loved it regardless!  The \"regular\" fries are big! I couldn't finish them all with my sister even though we shared them (both obviously full from our burgers). The cashier joked around and said he wouldn't let us get a bigger size because there are a lot of fries in the regular! They are great when fresh, but get a bit soggy in the middle after a while- so eat them quickly!   Overall, this place was great. The prices were not bad and only like an additional $1-$2 to get a second patty. The bacon cheeseburger was $7.97 if I remember correctly. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"BurgerFi had amazing burgers and fries! My favorite is the VegeFi burger and the Urban Fries! I love their veggie burger because it had a great consistency and isn't mushy, like some veggie burgers. Their fries are so good and the Urban Fries come with a garlic aioli sauce, which is heavenly!! Try BurgerFi! It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Honestly was hesitant to try this place as I wasn't sure what to expect. I was very impressed! It's a cool, modern spot that is a take on \"fast food\", like a chipotle for burgers! I am not a vegetarian and I had the veggie burger and thought it was fantastic. It had a ton of flavor and was crispy and I thought their fries were good, too. I really liked this place and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A great addition to this area. The dining and patio areas were nice and well kept. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I love that I can order my burger protein, or green style as they called it. Their chocolate custard was heavenly! We will go back.  I wish they had sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good burger to hit the spot this place does it. It smash burger and five guys had a baby \"burgerfi\" would be the result. This was my first time and I truly enjoyed the quality and quantity of food. I am a huge fan of smash burger but I think burgerfi has taken its place."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Burger Fi! The place is nice and clean with a cool vibe. They have a larger menu to pick from with some great options. I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I just got the standard cheeseburger.   Next time, I'll try something new. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Came here for an Elite event. I will tell you, I don't nor should anyone need an event to come here, this place is amazing!! A true event in itself! The food is top-notch, the meat (beef) I learned is only sourced from a ranch in Montana under strict guidelines to the point they do not even use ATV's to herd the cattle because that can stress the cows affecting the meat quality and tenderness....it shows in the taste and texture of the burger, so good.. The burger I tried was the 'Breakfast All Day Burger', it had hash browns on it, a fried egg (cage free) and bacon and syrup...all top quality ingredients, and a super soft bun, that was branded!!! The onion rings are AMAZING!! The fries are some of my favorite, everyone has a fry they love, always a sticky topic. These particular fries are super great because they leave the skin on and are cut and made to order. They also have custard, I of course had to try and was surprised at how rich and flavorful it was...excellent. I really enjoy the fact that this place is resourceful (recycled plastic and pallets for furniture) has games to play on the patio, HAS local craft BEER, WINE and MIMOSAS and a great staff and owner that take pride in their food and service.  While this is a \"Burger Joint\" don't misunderstand that ordering  at a counter and getting your own table means you eat and bail...eat, hang out, play some games, have a couple rounds of drinks and enjoy your company! Time well spent :)  I am already looking forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"Burgers, fries and onion rings are good. Burgers are a little on small side; give you a lot of fries and rings. Had to wait 5 to 10 minutes for lunch. Little pricey: 3 burgers 2 orders of fries and 3 soft drinks came to $ 42.000"}
{"text":"Goodness gracious this place has some amazing burgers. far we've been here twice, and both experiences were top-notch. Everything that they make here is outstanding, and honestly these have been some of the most decadently delicious burgers which I've eaten in Arizona. They do the classics well, but they also have a few adventurous items (nothing crazy- I didn't see any foie gras burgers, although I would TOTALLY eat that and please someone make this happen for me right now). Their onion rings are the Gods' truth, and their fancy soda dispenser had some very cool options. Who doesn't want an icy Mello-yello with lunch?!?!?  All in all, this is easily one of my favorite burger places near home, and I can't think of anything that I wish was different about it!"}
{"text":"Just as expensive as 5 guys and not even close to as good. Burgers are Swensons sized but where getting 2 doubles at swensons will run you about 8-10 burger fi would be 17-20. Shoestring Fries are nothing special. Have been there 8-10x bc my parents live close and are big fans but I don't see why except they like small portions"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD AMAZING STAFF. Huge shout out to manager Michael for making it so much better and going the extra mile for making this dining experience amazing."}
{"text":"Was originally going to 5 guys and saw this place and decided to try it. I loved how fresh the burger was when it came out. It tasted a lot more healthy than a 5 guys burger. The French fries were delicious. I would recommend this burger place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on 01.23.15.    Seems like a cool place.  Very busy at lunchtime.  I ordered from their \"secret menu.\"  I had the Alternative Style burger, and chili cheese fries.  I opted not to go for beer or wine, although they serve both here.  Instead I used the Coca Cola Freestyle machine to get a vanilla Sprite Zero.  The Alternative Style burger is a burger Smothered with a mixture of grilled diced onions, American cheese, mustard, and BurgerFi® sauce.  I am a huge fan of California's IN-N-OUT Burger, and their Animal Style Double-Double.  Although Burgerfi's Alternative Style burger didn't look like the ASDD, it tasted just like it!.  Love, love, loved it!  I asked them to make the fries well done, which came out nice and crispy.  Chili was just so-so, and the cheese was good.  My only complaint is that the fries were a little too salty for my taste.  Next time, I'll just ask for \"no salt.\"  I really liked the burger.  One can tell it's quality beef and fresh-cut potatoes for the fries.  I have no problem with the price, as long as the food is good...which it was.  I will be back here soon.  I just wish it wasn't 45 minutes away from where I live."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like them. There are not a lot of good burger places in the area- River City Bar and Grill cover your ears. The burgers are good, not great. The fries and rings are good, not great. The beer and wine selection is good, not great. The cute little branded buns are a novelty but I truly like 5 Guys better. For the price and quality, roll down the road."}
{"text":"My go to for burgers in Tempe, love the place service is good it's clean and staff is very nice. A++++++++ Always come here at least once a week burgers are to die for. Highly recommend the CEO burger melts in your mouth literally."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with the fam. Place gets really busy around lunchtime. Burgers good as always, (relatively) healthy too! Really can't go wrong with a fried egg on anything imho. Will be back soon. Good prices and nice fry selection."}
{"text":"I got the breakfast burger with Cajun Fries. Burger was decent for your average fast food burger. The fries were a little over done but I liked the seasoning. Not a bad spot to go for lunch. Kind of pricey for the proportions."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed Burger Fi. The onion rings were huge, dipped in a delicious batter, and fried correctly.The burgers were really good. I had a single with blue cheese, mushrooms, onions and burger fi sauce. Not quite as good as Flipside or The Rail, but for a casual, quick place where you can have a beer with your meal it fits the bill. Not anywhere near as expensive as Flipside or the Rail either. My family of 5 had 3 singles, 1 double,1 breakfast all day burger, 2 orders of fries and rings combined and 4 fountain drinks for $45. it costs me twice that to go to Flipside (which is our favorite burger place).  This place was packed to the gills and it only took 30 minutes to get through the line and out the door with our food, I thought that was pretty impressive. All the staff was helpful and polite. Kudos to the management for training them well. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went there over the weekend, and love the overall concept for the place. I ordered a burger (which you apparently have to call the BugerFi Burger, because I just said burger and the guy looked at me like I had a horn growing out of my head), fries with salt and vinegar, and a soda. First off, everyone that works there seems to think they are the greatest thing ever, they are very rude, pushy, and arrogant.    The food is extremely overpriced, but I was willing to try it out. The burger, fries and coke were $18, but when the burger was delivered, I was shocked. The burger was a double, but about four inches across and three inches high.  It was very small. It was not worth the money, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Two stars, but just because the quinoa burger was amazing. The regular burgers are dried out and really small. There's not much flavor to the meat and the texture..eh. I'm not impressed. For being a burger joint, they don't do a very good job.        The fries were only ok. We tried the crispy (not limp) fries with garlic parmesan. They weren't very good. They didn't taste garlicky at all and just were bland.        Two burgers and a regular fry costed $20. Not a good deal. Maybe if the food was better but overall I'm not impressed and won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has great service and some of the best burgers and fries. Always a pleasant experience when we visit!"}
{"text":"Wow another great burger from this place. If you haven't tried I would have foods great here"}
{"text":"I have to say I highly recommend this burger joint,we have been going here awhile and had one tiny bad experience, but they came thru and made it right!! Awesome customer service and delicious food! Management is top notch!!! Thank you for always putting the customer first! We will be back...again!"}
{"text":"I like this place enough to give it 3 stars. It's yet another burger gimmick place. They brand their burgers (BurgerFi is burnt right into the top bun nice touch)...the thing this place has going for it are the onion rings! I'd literally come here for the Onion Rings! Other than that, it's a decent burger (my opinion is they are over-priced for an average tasting burger, and just ok french fries). Metal table and chairs really? Strike! This is not a place I'd visit on a regular basis..."}
{"text":"AMAZING ONION RINGS!!! Their burgers are always perfect. You can build your own, they serve alcohol and ice cream. Nice atmosphere. Very chill."}
{"text":"I expected to get a hamburger, not a slider. It was good, but man do they get you on the fries. I did receive good customer service so no complaints there. It wasn't too busy inside when I went and the establishment was clean."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Richard Marx - Satisfied)  We hiked our bodies weary for BurgerFi There must be more to eatin' this family fries   What should we Yelp for some burger time You may not even have an appetite Ain't no sense in losing your chance They're gonna make it worth the ride  Don't you know, I won't be happy until I'm at BurgerFi Don't you know, why should I stop untilm I'm at BurgerFi   I came to BurgerFi on a whim since my buddies and I just finished hiking and happened to park next to this place.    BurgerFi has an urban modern atmosphere with and open feel; not sure if that's the case for all BurgerFi restaurants around the country.    There's definitely nothing basic about these burgers from breakfast style, veggie style, and even serving up some hot dogs; if you're feeling for that instead.  I went for their BurgerFi Bacon Cheeseburger; double bacon, double angus beef, and American cheese.  Overall, pretty solid and greasy to the bite.  The bacon was crispy and beef patties were done medium with cheese oozing.  I'm pretty critical of my burgers and this one definitely pass the test for me.  I really love the bun and patty ratio, which was perfect, while the bun itself was like a soft Hawaiian bun.  In the end, BurgerFi delivered to this palates just fine.  I love myself a good burger every now and then, but these days I have to listen to the love handles!  Needless to say, I would definitely recommend this spot! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place one day, and I had amazing service. The first time I went in and I had tried a burger fied bacon cheeseburger, and boy was it delicious. A few weeks later I had to take my mom to go and try this. She was also very satisfied with the food and extras from the menu. Great place!"}
{"text":"If I could give it less than 1 Star, I would . The staff was rude. My burger was not cooked, and I ordered the CEO, it didn't have what it said on the menu. It was also just thrown together. Too bad , I was so excited to eat there. Fries were good though, the half that wasn't burnt anyway."}
{"text":"This place has great burgerfi. They have a really strong signal and download rates near 18 bbps (burger bites per second). Much better than the other Internet burger service providers. Only complaint is the burgers are kind of small, even the double."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and I loved it! I had the veggie burger and it was amazing. Everything was very flavorful and I'll be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"My family went here last night for dinner.  There were many people in the dining room, but nobody in line at the cashier.  We waited roughly five minutes for service, but were disappointed.  One server stood with her back to us talking to a cook (I believe they were gathering a large order, but there was a lot of standing and talking involved in this).  Another server asked a woman standing off to the side looking at her phone if she'd been helped.  The woman nodded and the server left.  It was as if my family and I weren't there, so we decided not to be and went down the road to Dairy Queen instead.  Still got a burger, but saved a lot of money.  Burgerfi may have just been having an off-night, and the food might be ok, but I can't give any stars for a restaurant that can't even acknowledge customers.  It'll be a long time, if ever, before we try again."}
{"text":"Great tasting burger and great fries! My friend got a milkshake and it was so sinful. Its roughly the same price as five guys but has better burgers. A must try!"}
{"text":"BurgerFi is in the middle of a 3.5-4 rating.   What I got:   1. BurgerFi burger. It was okay. Nothing super special to me. 3.5/5  2. Cry + Fries. Which is onion rings and fries. If you're planning to order this, share it with another person. 4/5  3. Oh My Chocolate custard. I enjoyed the first 4 bites then after that I got kind of sick of it. It's very over the top chocolate-y. If that's your thing then you'll like it. 3/5  What I liked about this place was I could order off the monitor. I didn't really feel like interacting today so I did enjoy that.   Only negative is that the burger was alright, fries were better and that this place is a little pricey for fast-food burgers.  Would come back, but not my go to burger spot.  Tip: they have student discounts!"}
{"text":"Cool place...burgers are fresh and good...don't taste like a grease bomb like 5 guys!!!  Only thing is, it is a little spendy for a burger...can't beat in-n-out for overall quality and price!!!"}
{"text":"Well...I guess I am somewhat confused by some of these reviews.  Yes, it is more expensive than McDonalds. Burgerfi promotes grass fed fresh beef, not frozen burgers.  There is no doubt this is promoted as a higher end burger joint and offers very limited menu of burgers, fries, onion rings and shakes/concretes (better known as DQ Blizzards to Northeast Ohio).  Burgerfi is hybrid restaurant offering of a cross between a sit-down server restaurant with a faster food experience if you are in a hurry..  You place your order at the counter, get a beeper that lets you know when your food is ready so you can pick it up, then stay as long as you want.  I have been 3 times now and have had the burger twice and while it is smaller than 5 Guys, its really obvious this is 10 steps above McDonalds and fast food.  There is a Breakfast All Day Burger that offers Bacon and Egg on top and a Wagyu Beef Hot Dog (Wagyu is America's version of Kobe Beef with better marbling and flavor) that is impressive.  You also can create your own burger.  As previously written, the Quinoa Burger is good as well.  However, as a healthy alternative, this one did not make the cut with me as it is fried.  If I am going to nosedive and eat fried food...then I would just as soon eat the fries or onion wings!    i enjoyed both the fries and especially the onion rings and the drink machines allow you to create so many unique drink combinations are really cool bordering on overwhelming if you have trouble making decisions.  I also like that the company believes in sustainability and saved the old Little Mountain Farm Market and turned it into arguably one of the coolest eating spaces in the Lake County area.  Tables, Chairs, and even the plastic cups are all from recycled material and so I give the chain credit for being environmentally friendly as well.  If given a choice, I think Flipside down in Chagrin Falls and Hudson would edge out Burgerfi.  However, judging by the consistent traffic and full tables inside and out, pretty sure there are quite a few people happy to see Burgerfi come to our city!!!"}
{"text":"Try the conflicted burger, they're great.  Also the Cry and Fry.  Great rings!  Fun place"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight with mom, dad and hubby. I never would have known it was here if I didn't go to the Starbucks next door.   First impression, fun and different. Good location. A little reminiscent of Hopdoddys in Scottsdale. It is an order at the counter and go get your own food restaurant. Which I like, no waiting around for things or your drink to be refilled.   I ordered a cheeseburger and cry and fry. Sidebar: I appreciate that they put the calories on the menu. Burger was typical- tomatoes, lettuce, two patties and a smear of \"special sauce\".  I liked it- Not great, not bad but good. Maybe better than five guys, maybe not but comparable. (To be honest, I'm not a big fan of five guys though)   The cry and fry were actually very tasty. I really loved the onion rings, but I have to be honest the fries were way too salty. I hope they tone that down a bit.   My mama ordered a quinoa burger, I was skeptical but I actually really liked it- more than my cheeseburger. I would probably order that next time over my cheeseburger.   Hubby had hot dogs- I didn't try them but he enjoyed them.   Manager stopped by to make sure food was good- he was nice and touched base but didn't linger which I liked.   I will go back. Clean, cute, fast, close to home and a decent place to go and get exactly what you want. A burger and fries."}
{"text":"Five Guy's appears the standard for this type of restaurant and price point, although BurgerFi has a larger menu and serves beer.  Comparing burgers head to head, Five Guys wins handily. Five Guys burgers are much bigger and meatier. BurgerFi burgers are small and somewhat tasty, but they're mushy and the meat is flavorless and overpowered by the rest of the sandwich. The order of fries were big enough for two people and were decent. There are other items on the menu I might try if I go back, but for time being I'll stick with FiveGuys. BurgerFi will probably satisfy enough people to stay profitable, but for the time being I'd say they're on probation."}
{"text":"Finally tried BurgerFi last week.  I read the reviews a couple of weeks ago, so I went in with a certain amount of anticipation. Apparently they read the reviews, as well.  The service was outstanding.  They greet you as soon as you walk up and are very pleasant.  They also have Iced Tea now (I didn't try it, I just remembered some reviewers complaining about it). The burgers are a little on the small side, but more than acceptable for the price.  The burger selection is outstanding (I had mine with extra cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled diced onions, jalapenos and pickles on the side with garlic mayo...very, very good!). My wife had the Breakfast All Day burger without the maple syrup. The quality on both was very good, not dry, cooked perfectly and the condiments are just right.   The fries are very good plain, but doctored up with one of their toppings and fried extra crispy and they are over the top (we got the Urban Fries extra crispy...highly recommended).  The onion rings are awesome. Giant sized rings and the batter stays on. I believe this place is going to do well because they have it all.  Decent burgers, great fries and onion rings.  But to top it off, they have draft beer; bottled beer; even PBR in a can; they have wine; shakes and frozen custard for desert.  They have everyone covered. Good food, good atmosphere, good service.  I can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"As we are standing in line to order there are about 6 people in line and 1 person taking orders, there are 2 other people standing behind the counter smiling. The food is overall good just got a normal cheeseburger and french frys tastes like an expensive  iceburg burger... it is clean friendly environment just overpriced for the quality"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because the burgers taste exactly like Freddy's burgers to me at a more expensive price.  Very clean and the staff is super friendly.  They have  cool soda dispensers I've never seen before and have a variety of Fanta sodas including the zeros which were great.  It was good and I am going to try it again so I can try the garlic fries."}
{"text":"$31 for two beyond burgers, fries, and drinks. They also have beer on tap. I was pleasantly surprised with how progressive this place is. If you do eat meat, they have the staples, hormone free and no antibiotics. The fries are bomb ! Obviously fresh and no extra ingredients in them. I also like the peanuts oil. It has a higher melting point. Keeps the saturated fat lower.   Great service and it's fast and fresh. Couldn't ask for more from a burger shop."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this, wanted being the key work. All I wanted was build your own veggi patty, green style, with blue cheese, BBQ, pickles, and jalapeños. I know how it sounds but I love it. It took the poor girl several try's before getting correct. Only one person ahead of me and 25 minutes later because apparently they made it wrong the first time and it still wasn't right. Very good Blue Cheese but it was just lumped in the middle. Only 2 pickles and 1 jalapeño and no BBQ sauce. It was not bad but not great either.  Also stay away from the garlic aioli, mayonnaise with a little bit of garlic, not an aioli. They do have a nice atmosphere sort of like a modern 5 guys. Also everyone that worked there was really nice.  All give it one more try when I can sit and enjoy a local four peaks beer, another plus."}
{"text":"I can't say that the food disappointed me, other than the \"regular\" order of fries being highly disproportionate to the size of one burger (I can't make it through half of the fries).  The burgers are tasty, there's no doubt about it, but they are a bit on the small side. The branded clam shell bun doesn't serve much of a purpose other than being a fad.  The prices are INSANELY high for what you get... even worse than 5 Guys (and it's basically the same thing).  I got a burger, a small fry, and a small fountain drink for a modest $14.87.  I could go sit down, be waited on, get a better burger and a bottomless soda at several other restaurants, and leave a tip at the end and spend this much.  Although I enjoyed the food, I doubt I will bring my business here too often."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burger places. Although this restaurant is a chain, it stays very consistent. The cheeseburger and breakfast burger are absolutely mouth watering!! But if you're wondering what the best part is about burgerfi... I'm here to tell you! THE FRIES!!! Must try restaurant."}
{"text":"Update: decided to give BurgerFi a chance after customer service was swift to reply and apologize for the negative experience I had prior. I had the beyond meat burger and my boyfriend had the Vegefi burger. Both were delicious and didn't taste unhealthy (if you know what I mean) so I was very pleased! Also, the beyond meat patty tastes extremely similar to beef so I was happy for that option! The staff was pleasant and told us about current specials they have during the week. All in all, it was a great experience and I'm happy that I gave them a second chance.  And I'm a sucker for generous portions of frys (this was a regular)."}
{"text":"Finally! I am not a double patty kinda gal and they modified the CEO to a single( perfect). I also ordered the Urban Fries which are perfect for sharing. Try their special drink in the coke dispenser, pretty good! Fast and fresh!"}
{"text":"Decent burger joint. Love the fries and onion rings. Had the burger fi cheeseburger and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Second time that I order a chicken apple dog, place the order, sit down and get paged to tell me that they are out of them.   1st time I understand supply and demand... 2nd time, mis-management!  Too many good places to eat, I won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been dying to try this new restaurant for a while & our experience was pretty amazing.   I enjoyed the fact that the burger meat was slightly burned on the edges, yet still moist in the middle. I added on the garlic aioli, lettuce(deliciously crisp), tomatoes, and the BurgerFi sauce to my single meat, cheeseburger. He got the double meat, custom burger, no cheese, with pretty much the same toppings + pickles. Alongside our burgers, we ordered salt and vinegar fries. The flavor was spot on what flavors we expected, yet it wasn't as crisp as I would have liked. Knowing that, I'll probably order the crispy fries next time.   The prices are on the higher side, especially for college students, so I won't be a regular due to this. Another negative is the fact that avocado was not an option for a topping; as an avid burger consumer, I feel as though for gourmet-ish joint like BurgerFi, it should have this as an option."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger I had in AZ. Fries are good too. The place has excellent ambience."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing to say the least!   Burgers are only a step above McDonalds but at triple McDonalds price!   It took almost 20 minutes to get our order even though they were not that busy. One of us ordered the basic hot dog with chili. It was $6,  overcooked, dried out and nothing special. Just an ordinary dog and especially not $6 worth.    Burgers are very small so order at least a double.  (their house sauce is good)   We drove by everyday while they were under construction and was excited to see it finally open only to be greatly disappointed once we tried it.     The best part of the experience is the really really cool soda machine they have to give all combinations of several different coke products.    I always try to give any business more than one opportunity so we may try it one more time to see if it gets any better.  Since this is a chain, they should have it already figured out!!  As it stands right now, I cannot recommend going there. Loud music, noisy atmosphere, slow service and mediocre food is not a recipe for a successful restaurant experience"}
{"text":"The saltiest \"healthy\" burgers I have ever had.  I am comparing it to five guys and Swenson.  I would go there before going here again. I may give it another try before writing this off completely, but it is difficult to pass up the market district food court, especially the Asian grill."}
{"text":"Great food! We got garlic fries and those were also good. I was very happy that they offered beer as well and they also had happy hour deals and a student discount! I honestly enjoyed this more than in n out! These arent fancy burgers by any means, but if you are looking for a quick and delicious burger at a place that is also a great to meet up with friends or hangout, this place is for you! I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I love the Yelp community and the service that Yelp provides. When a fellow Yelper, Cheryl K mentioned a Burger Fi employee by name, I took notice. I will echo Yelper Cheryl K's admiration for BurgerFi employee, Jacy!   Jacy loves people and loves her job! I would hire her in a second to be the face of a fast food burger bar like BurgerFi!  My cheeseburger, fries and shake were good but it was Jacy's outstanding service that made my dining experience GREAT!  Thank you BurgerFi and Ms. Jacy!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. It was tasty but here's the problem. They couldn't tell me if there were beans in the chili. Ok. Many places can't tell you that. Then I asked if they had blue cheese. Burger place. They have bacon burgers so why not have blue cheese. After they had to go ask a manager they determined no Blue cheese. No problem. Then I get my food. I ordered a bacon burger with cheese. So being my first time I get my burger hot and ready to taste. I take a big bite. One thing missing. Bacon. No bacon on my bacon cheese burger. I take the burger back in (with a bite taken out) and I wait a couple minutes and they give me back my burger with 3 tiny pieces of bacon WITH THE BITE STILL TAKEN OUT!  Who does that?  So my burger sat there getting cold while it waited for the bacon and then it was served to me. I was so surprised that I just took it and ate it. I can't believe with the people working there that they would not remake the burger and serve me a hot burger with the bacon I ordered. It's a Tuesday night. Pretty empty and with service like this I can understand why this place is empty. To make it even more epic we just asked for our free small cup of custard for checking in on Yelp and they don't know what to do. It's been ten minutes and still no custard. If I was the owner and wondering why in not making more money I can let you know. It's not your food or your concept. It's the  people you have working here. If you are here then you just except terrible. I had given a two stars before the custard thing. So the reason for the delay. They couldn't open the bag of Oreos. Too much for them to handle."}
{"text":"Being insulted by staff really ruined this place for me this time. I imagine when I spent money at a restaurant I would be insulted by the staff. Or better yet made the brunt of their homophobic jokes. But that is just me. Too bad the first time I liked the food. This time it did not taste as good."}
{"text":"ALL I CAN SAY IS CONCRETE.   Seriously the key lime pie concrete is the reason I am alive. Literally heaven in a cup. But it is a lot. So I would recommend sharing a concerte... actually best way to do it is to ask them to make it in 2 separate cups to share... you get WAY MORE... practically 2 for the price of one.   And the burgers are good too. Best I found in Ohio."}
{"text":"Outstanding spot for Burgers. Their All Day Breakfast Burger rocks and the Bacon Double is awesome. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I visited the one location while in West Palm Beach FLORIDA.  I had been craving to return for some time!  While in Cleveland on business, I seen one listed in Mentor.  I had to drive the 30 mins out of the way just to sit and eat here!  The food is great, the atmoshpere is wonderful and the employees were very knowledgeable!  I know where to return when I come to Cleveland!!  Open one in Columbus, OH!!!  Would love one here!!!"}
{"text":"Really good place for a quick bite to eat!  I live close to BurgerFi [short for Burgerfication of the USA] and have passed by the building many times since construction began. So when a friend let me pick a [cheapo] place for dinner, I immediately thought of them.   It's a real simple menu - burgers/hot dogs, fries/o-rings, shakes, AND ALCOHOL. You can order ahead, order at the counter with a human, or order in-store at an iPad. The iPad takes a pic of your face as part of checkout to ensure you get your meal. Super neat to have all the options. It wasn't terribly busy when our group dined, and we all got our meals within a few minutes of another. The burger options are crazy - bacon AND cooked onions for no additional cost?! Hells yes. On this day i was feeling uber hungry so I got the Conflicted Burger [real beef patty & veggie patty]. Holy cow, that is one amazing burger! I also saw Red Velvet shake so of course I #treatyoself to extra calories. Totally worth every extra calorie consumed.   In total I spent $13 for a really amazing crazy burger + shake, cannot wait to go back again. Hope they can make it in Tempe."}
{"text":"We tried this place and we're super excited about it. We were so disappointed:( my burger had no flavor and when I asked for ranch for my onion rings it tasted exactly like the spices that were used for the onion rings themselves. Yuck!! We were also overcharged and had to get that fixed before we left. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Not only are the burgers great they care about the customer....had a great conversation with one of the investors while I waited for my food. Guy made my day talking about sports!!!"}
{"text":"This burger place is actually better than I thought it would be... You can get beer and wine here :)! But the burgers are all cooked well done, although I wish you could get a choice of how it can be cooked (I guess you can't have everything, but the burgers are still very good). Also too, BurgerFi has veggie burgers as well if red meat isn't your thing. In addition to having shakes, and onion rings, they have fresh cut fries and the fry portions are huge (and these fresh cut fries can be doctored up to make them even better than what they already are)! Yes, you might pay a little bit more, but hey, you get what you pay for, and for here, you're paying for some good food."}
{"text":"Great food, premium prices. Burger & fries is small compared to Five Guys and tastes exactly the same, with fewer condiment options. Dining atmosphere is superior to their previously mentioned competitor, and they serve beer, which is a plus.  Everything is a la carte, so I paid $13, which isn't a great value, but at least they provide quality food that you won't immediately regret putting inside of your body.  Overall, prefer the burger joint across the street."}
{"text":"With lots of burger options in mentor, we tend up always coming back to Burger Fi!  They have excellent onion rings that are HUGE and super tender, the burgers are always great and the staff is great too!    My daughter always asks for the custard too!  If I hadn't made the mistake of looking up the calories after eating the \"death by chocolate\" I'd get it all the time.    (Full disclosure, I was offered a sample of custard and then asked if we could write an honest review, and I have been meaning to write a review for a long time)"}
{"text":"Went in today to give it a try and ordered the CEO sans bun. It was really good and I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"It is my second time at this place. First time we had a family dinner and I really liked it. Our second time we were in the area and needed to grab some quick bite with my husband. The place was the same nice and clean and this time there wasn't lots of people there just us and another guy that was already eating. It took them way to long to make our food and when I start eating I was kind of disappointed French fries was really over fried and my burger was really plain with no flavor. I know it was vegan burger but being a vegan doesn't mean we don't like food, we just don't like to eat animals. On my first bites all I had was some bread and a vegan patty, so I looked what was inside: One tiny lettuce leaf, small slice of tomato and 3 tiny slices of pickle, penny seized drop of mixed ketchup mustard and mayo that I can't even taste on my burger.  I probably gonna go there again cause they do serve vegan options and I did liked it on our first visit, but I really hope I will have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"Have visited this location on several occasions - close to ASU. Very good burgers - quality meat, great bacon and flavorful cheese! They are consistent and have plenty of options.  Besides burgers, they have various options for fries and other goodies. The shakes are handmade and awesome.  Lastly, the service is great - always with a smile and helpful. The restaurant is clean!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good double cheese burger. Can you say HUGE order of single frys they can easily feed 3-4 people. Nice atmosphere and not busy on a Sunday evening. Give this place a try.."}
{"text":"Burgers are the BOMB!!!!! The hotdogs are really good too! Seating is a pain in the butt thought or would give 5 stars. Great grub"}
{"text":"The food was okay- I ordered a single with lettuce, tomato, and grilled onions and a side of fries and a small fountain drink. Everything was tasty but I paid over $11 for what I thought was an average meal. I probably won't go back because it just didn't \"wow\" me much."}
{"text":"Solid 3 Stars. Not quite a 4. This was my first time in BurgerFi. Saturday evening, the place was nearly empty. At first glance, the place look nice. Appeared clean. Plenty of seating. There was a Skee-Ball tiype game inside and a couple of basketball games out on the patio. Not sure if it was there all the time or a promotion, but we had fun playing them while waiting for our order. Can't comment on the chairs like the other reviewers as we sat out on the patio at a picnic table. Staff was courteous and prompt. They were training a new employee and asked if she could take our order. We were quick to oblige. The food arrived in a timely fashion.  The Burger; I had a double \"build your own\" burger. Fresh ingredients. Lettuce tomato and such. Meat had a good flavor. The price might have been a little steep considering the portion size but the other burgers at our table looked equally as fresh and everyone had good things to say about the flavor. While the bun was,.....\"good\". I would have liked the burger to sit on a nice brioche bun or an equivalent. Maybe even a choice of bun. But I do want to make the point that the burger was delicious.  The Fries; Fresh cut fries. Choice of fry toppings. Large portion. The regular fry will feed two. I got the parmesan & herb fries. Winner!  I consider BurgerFi to be fast food. What sets it apart from other \"Fast Food\"? Hmm,.....let me see,....oh yeah, ALCOHOL!! It was refreshing to have a cold beer and play games while waiting for our order. If you want to have a drink or a beer and a burger you are forced to go to a sit down restaurant. It was a great change and the price for alcohol was fair.   In summary; GOOD burgers. FANTASTIC fries. AFFORDABLE beer. WONDERFUL staff.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Pretty average burger place, they have very juicy burgers but their fries are very reminiscent of Five Guys...otherwise, it's definitely not something to write home about. Not really extraordinary and kind of expensive, but it hit the spot when I was having a burger craving."}
{"text":"Really good burgers, but I've had better for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Cheap burger for a high price. For what you pay here you can get the same quality burger fries, a cup of chili and chicken fingers at steak and shake. Drive to mayfield to 5 guys if you are looking for a good burger."}
{"text":"I came here about a few months ago for the first time after seeing that it was new after driving by. I came here a few hours before they closed so there wasn't a ton of people in which I thought was going to be nice. I didn't have to wait in line, the ordering process was easy, the menu is decently sized with tons of options. I am vegetarian so it was very nice being able to eat here. The fries and super yummy including the onion rings. My only complaint is the wait time was a little long, especially since there wasn't a ton of people eating in besides my boyfriend and I. Overall, I probably will come back because the prices were good, the food was good and I always love a vegan burger!"}
{"text":"Noticed the spot & stopped, first mistake. Thought twice because of an empty parking lot at 5pm. (dinner time) second mistake. The 3rd mistake was when I asked the female behind the counter if the patties were fresh, hand made, she replied, \"no, fresh, Angus beef, premade from vendor, never frozen,\" third mistake. I thought for a moment to just walk out then something said just give it a try, stop being a snob! (I'm a chef by trade)  So sorry I did. Wasted my time & $$$. There was so much bread, lettuce, tomato pickles & sause!!! WAY to much sauce, on both sides of the break yuck!!! My stomach it still queasy from the amount of mustard/1000 island (2 different burgers). I can't even tell you about the quality of the burger, it was lost in \"the stuff\"! A burger joint should emphasize \"The Burger\"!!! Totally sub par & extremely disappointing! I should have tried Smashburger! Five Guys has better quality, even In and Out Burger is better! Hire a chef so he can help you improve your product! If you have a taste for a burger DO NOT  go there as you will be looking for the burger through the bread and condiments! It was so horrible I give it \"0\"stars!  On a good note, the reason I even gave it 2 stars was for cleanliness and friendliness of staff the only two things that place has going for it! The customer service was a plus, the only redeemable Factor....thank you but no thank you! Bonne chance, Amuse-toi!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of our customer service this time. We ordered to go and when we got home we realized our order was incorrect. Nobody apologized or seemed concerned that I had to come all the way back to get my food a second time. I wasn't offered even a water cup while I waited another 10 minutes for a burger to be remade. Frustrating. If you mess up food somebody has paid for, apologize and try to make it worth their drive back."}
{"text":"For a burger joint this place is a keeper. We will be back. I had the brisket burger with bleu cheese and swiss. OMG my mouth is watering just thinking of how delicious it was. We also ordered a bucket of parmesian and herb fries. That was a lot of fries for 4 people. We took 3/4 of then home. The atmosphere is family friendly and very welcoming. The staff was courteous and friendly as well. We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Ate here last Friday I had to 28 and a sprite with a small fry. it was pretty good but I wasn't too crazy that it cost me about $17 but you know at least it tasted awesome, and The inside of the place looks really cool so yeah I guess I will be going back one day"}
{"text":"I love how fresh the hamburger is.  The food is always great, and the staff is always friendly.  We have never had less than a great meal here."}
{"text":"The food was really good, though the customer service was severely lacking. I don't really need to be told how I should organize my group, what I should order, and how I should do everything about my meal by a waitress who was snotty and rude."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it two because although the food was slightly above average, their menu is set up horribly. Burgers run you $6-12 each and aren't huge (not enough to fill me up and I don't eat a lot). There are fries, onion rings, or a combination of the two, which all only come in a very large size and cost $5-6 a piece. Also only one size drink, which is small and cost $2 and change. They also have hot dogs for $6 and up. Other than frozen custards, that's their entire menu and sizes. No kids menu, no small, medium, or even regular large sized sides. I had no idea how to order for my six year old. If I went there by myself, I would be forced to order a burger big enough for one meal, side with enough food for two or three meals  (the onion rings are seriously a LOT) and a little baby drink. Take your current menu and expand by adding more size options, for the love of Pete."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers and french fries. The employees were very helpful and patient. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Please try the fries and onion rings. The burgers are really well made, cooked perfectly and have great flavor. They are actually smaller than I thought but don't worry you won't walk away hungry. Was looking forward to trying a malt shake and or their custard but on this day they were out. :( oh well, just means I have to come back another day and I'm not mad about that!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place on the day they had the special. The burger was decent nothing to shout about. I was kind of disappointed. So I say this place is average and way too expensive.  Customer service is lacking also."}
{"text":"When they first opened I didn't like the burgers, just not good in my opinion. My husband wanted to try them again so we ordered them from uber eats- burgers and cheese fries. Although expensive, the burgers have much improved. Maybe better quality beef? I don't know but they are yummy & the fries are even better. I only have three stars because it's so expensive"}
{"text":"Great burgers - the default is a double. Lots of fresh cut fries - portions are huge - a regular size fry will feed two people. The onion rings are amazing - very crispy and huge. Well worth the price. Convenient ordering system online to save waiting at the restaurant if you are picking up food - definitely recommend using this feature on their site."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fresh fries, and amazing shakes. That all equals a great lunch. Big tables and family friendly."}
{"text":"First, I don't get the hype on this place. Seriously. But, here's the deal-e-o on BurgerFi. They use Angus Beef. Did you fall out of your seat? I didn't either. They make 6 burgers their way, ($5.97 - $10.57) or, you can build your own with either one ($4.47), two ($5.97) or three ($7.47) patties. They offer 4 types of Cheese for a buck. Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Jalapenos, Grilled Onions and/or Diced Onions are yours if you want them. They offer 21 additional condiments, some are free and some are not, like grilled mushrooms, onion ring, Fried Egg, Chili, Salt+Vinegar chips, Cheese sauce and/or Peter Luger sauce for a buck each. Kraut and Garlic Aioli are 50 cents each and Bacon is $1.57. You can also get your burger Green style which if you're a fan of In N Out, is Protein style. (burger wrapped in lettuce, no bun).  They offer 3 different dogs, Vienna Beef ($3.97), Chicken Apple ($4.97) and Kobe-Style Beef ($5.47). You can have it your way or pick one of the 3 ways BurgerFi does them. (additional cost of course) Fries, yep, they have fries. 3 sizes. Bucket ($6.57), Large ($4.37) and Regular ($3.27). They also have Onion Rings in Large ($4.97) and Regular ($4.37). They also have a French Fry / Onion Ring combo. ($5.47). The cool thing here is they offer their fries and rings with 8 different toppings (additional cost) if you choose. They sell Custard and do it in Shakes, Malts, Floats, Cows, Sundaes and Concretes. ($4.47 - $5.97) Drinks are ($2.57 - $2.97) and include the Coke Freestyle machine, Awesome, fresh squeezed ades, real cane sugar sodas and bottled water. They also offer craft beers and wine. Are you hungry yet? C and I were. But I have to agree with one Yelper who commented that the menu is not that easy to figure out. I asked the girl behind the counter, Diane, if they had a kids burger. Nope. I would like to note here that it was also a bit difficult to talk with her because the background music was being played too loud.  I ordered C a single burger with American Cheese and extra, extra, extra, extra pickles. Plus a Freestyle soda and a regular size French Fries. C totally loved the Freestyle machine. He got his Powerade with lime flavor added. He couldn't stop talking about it. What he did stop talking about was his burger, which he said tasted just like In N Out, except for the branded bun (they burn the BurgerFi brand into the top bun). Same taste but NOT the same price. Gotta pay more for that Angus beef even if you can't tell the difference. And the 4X extra pickles. He got 6. Then there were the fries. There is a lot of fries in the Regular order. Definately worth $3.27. BUT, they were limp and covered in Salt. I mean covered. It was gross. I wiped off as much as I could as I ate them but in the end, it was just wrong and we didn't finish our order. Maybe the top fell off the shaker as they were salting them. Either way, No Bueno. I ordered a single burger with white cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles and mustard. Wow, C was right. It tasted just like In N Out. Crazy. The burger was fine. It was a nice little cheeseburger. It was also $5.47.  3 Star burger BUT no kids meal, loud music, lousy over salted, limp fries and prices on the high side. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Had a great quick family meal here the other night. Burgers are really good, same with the fries and onion rings. Love the multiple beers on tap. My wife had a shake that was really good too. The place is really clean and the staff very friendly, we had a great quick dinner out."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS GREAT so please don't let this sway you. The Customer Service and Professionalism of the staff is what turned me off on this place.  8pm on a Wednesday. We walk into a pretty empty restaurant (a table of three in the corner) and reviewed the  food options. The High Schooler behind the counter didn't care we were there. Playing with her nails and  flirting with the cooks was more important at the time.  We place our order and my GF goes outside to a table. This is where the real fun begins. At 8:10 the workers start stacking the chairs (they close at 9) Remember, people are still eating in he restaurant. I notice the cooks eating on the line and the other clerk playing in her phone behind the counter. Is there a manager here or what?  After stacking half of the chairs, I notice the table of 3 get up to leave. They were pretty much forced out.  Another customer walks in (High Schooler) He must be a friend of theirs because he acted like he owned the place. Did I mention he had a Man Bun? So much for getting my food. He orders, flirts blah blah and BAM.... His food comes out while I wait.  Finally!!!! My food order is ready. I bring it out to the table and guess what? It's screwed up. One of our burgers was supposed to be on a lettuce bun. Nope..... Both on bread. We didn't want to fuss so we began to eat. As we ate I noticed the table of 3 in the parking lot talking. They would have still been in the restaurant if they were not felt forced out by the stacking of the chairs. Terrible.  The food was great, like it always is. The problem is I will not be returning. The unprofessionalism of the staff and the fact that a manager let it happen is such a let down.  I figured with a competitive burger joint down the street this joint would have stepped it up. Unfortunately they are moving backwards. Five Guys here I come."}
{"text":"Could have gotten a three but I took off a point for the LOUD music. You know the volume's too much when you're in a place not much bigger than an average classroom and they have to give you beepers since you'll never hear them call your order. It was pouring rain when I went and people were still sitting outside, apparently to get away from the blare.  So, for the food: Good fries. The Chicago dog, OK -- better than most others in this area -- but the condiments are all burgerish -- sliced tomato and pickle instead of chunks and spears.  $10 for that plus a drink. It's a decent place, but with so many great local burger places, this isn't someplace I'll go back to often."}
{"text":"Never eat here. The burgers are way too over priced, and you have to purchase the fries and the burger separate. The only good thing is that they use peanut oil which is slightly healthier, but as a restaurant it is highly not recommended. The water cup they give you is very small and can't hold much water at all. Why is a restaurant like this even allowed to be in business if they provide larger cups for sugary, fattening, diabetes-causing beverages when they provide small cups for life-nourishing and healthy water. The wait time here was horrendous, and once they took our order to food took about 15-20 minutes to come out. They didn't give me a receipt, and there was no kindness at all from the employees when we walked in or when we ordered our food. The restroom was dirty and the hand towels had run out. I doubt the employees were washing their hands at all. Steer clear of this place, you'd have better luck with McDonald's!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome food and fun atmosphere.  Staff is really nice and they do 15% military discount which I think is awesome!"}
{"text":"I saw they were doing a buy one get on for $1 promo, my roommate picked up some burger and i am pleasantly surprised at how delicious these were!! We just got the basic cheeseburger. It was so good. I really like they branding on the bun. The sauce was good. But my fav part, the back of the bun was sealed and it kept the burger in the bun instead of sliding around. The burger itself tasted fresh as well! Very impressed for the price.   The take out containers are eco friendly as well. And the take out bag had a self sealing top."}
{"text":"I just got this today, I ordered a classic double cheese burger for myself, and a Viggi burger for my GF. Everything tasted great, especially the Viggi burger!!   However, both our stomachs started making odd sounds simultaneously for a good hour. We are not sure what was going on, but we are definitely never eating from there again!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for health food, go elsewhere - but it is what it is. The burgers are awesome, good fries, members of the party who can eat onion liked the giant onion rings. Shakes were lovely! We'll be back (and maybe share a shake)."}
{"text":"Very average for the price. I ordered he CEO and it was so thin and tasted like scraps of other burgers thrown together. Absolutely no seasoning on the meat. Fries were very mediocre. The service was ok, but the food left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time with my 16 year old 6 foot son who isn't easy to fill up and not the biggest burger fan but I am and I was paying. I win!    He ordered the CEO burger and I ordered the double bacon cheeseburger. We also shared the combo basket of fries and onion rings.  The burgers were yum. Big and cook well. (I could have done a single easy) with generous toppings of cheese and added grilled onions. Bacon was a smidge skimpy and our buns were cold which was weird but ok.  The fries and onion ring combo was the perfect amount to share and were screaming hot.  The bill for the 2 of us was $34.00 with 2 drinks which was a bit more than I expected but elsewhere you'd pay a tip to a server vbringing it to this of more so money we'll spent. We will be back!"}
{"text":"For belated birthday, got a gift card and took my wife out for a burger. Wednesday evening, and a good crowd. Checked menu and \"built\" our burgers. Added basket of fries and drinks. Got our buzzer and picked our table.  Buzzer said, get a free sample of their custard. Wife, a choco-holic got hers, and me, a vanilla lover, got mine. Quick taste then our burgers were ready. Wife loved the bun (she says that is what makes a burger) and near was great. Saved with mine! Split small basket of fries with vinegar! Perfect fries! Although there is beer and wine available, got soft drinks instead. Back to the custard sample. Big enough to add to drink and make a float!!  Overall not as costly as people told me and way better than McD, BK, or Streak n Shake. In this area, just under BSpot, but everything pales to C'Town's Michael Symon.  Highly recommend it for my East Side peeps!!"}
{"text":"Stuck in Mentor getting autowork done, and decided to pass time by opening yelp.  After scrolling through local reviews, I came upon several good reviews for burgerfi.  After leaving the dealership, I decided to give it a try.  I am very impressed w this spot.  The namesake burger, the burgerfi (cheese) burger was amazing.  I got a single party, but it's also avail in a double.  The bun, lettuce, tomato and signature sauce was on point. The meat?   Outstanding; tasty, juicy, high quality.  I also had the onion rings- huge, crispy, delicious.  Other burger combos on the menu look equally as enticing. A tiny bit pricey, but you're receiving quality.  Go to a fast food spot if you want cheaper prices and cheaper quality.  I highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"What a burger! The atmosphere is really conducive to the consuming of a delicious and meaty burger that is both succulent and well seasoned. The prices were a little high, but I think it's always worth the extra money when you can construct your own burger with their miriad of delicious ingredients and options."}
{"text":"Good food and ice cream, friendly staff, but way overpriced. The milkshakes are way too small for what they charge, as are the burgers. I would choose Five Guys over this -- you get more bang for your buck there."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The Beyond Meat burger option for vegetarians/vegans is amazing. Love being able to go out and order a vegan burger that actually tastes good."}
{"text":"Was here for our monthly book club. Good sized place, love the meat-hook lighting. ;) I ordered a cheese burger fi, onion rings and a beer. The burger was really good, honestly better than Five Guys. And I love Five Guys. The onion rings are the best I've ever had. It's a little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it if you want a little more gourmet to your burger occasionally. Want to go back and try some of their \"secret\" menu items."}
{"text":"I was in town on business an d gave the P B and J hamburger a try.  OMG...It blew my mind"}
{"text":"We are in town for vacation.  Stopped by because our family said they have good veggie burgers and onion rings.  Boy were they right!  The best onion rings I have ever tasted.  Wish they had one in California!"}
{"text":"yesterday was my first time coming here and it was DELICIOUS! In N Out is my favorite burger place but after having this burger. Hands down beat it! Definitely will be returning. Didn't get to try the shakes because the burger filled me up, but they looked delicious! Love how it's right across from ASU! 10 stars if I could! Loved it and the service was amazing and so friendly, Thanks burgerFi!"}
{"text":"HOLY SHIZNIT STOP WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING AND GO HERE IMMEDIATELY.  My mom, sister, and I went here on our girl's day yesterday, and I am so glad we did. The set up of the restaurant flows really nicely, with one line for entree orders and one for custard/drinks. We decided to share an order of fries (one order is about a half pound) and I got a plain cheeseburger. The prices were average, if not a little below, which was nice. For the three of us it was about $24.  Getting our food took a little while, but then again, we went around 1pm, and they were super busy. Beyond that, the experience was awesome. The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned (and freaking *amazing*) and the fries were to die for.   Once we were done with our food, we got frozen custard (hint: Get the junior... they are ginormous) and even that was delectable. All in all, great food, great atmosphere, friendly workers, clean environment... I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So good.  So good. The BAD Burger is divine. BAD = Breakfast All Day. My husband and I love this place because they have great prices, outdoor seating and the food is incredible. Love that they serve beer and coke in the bottles."}
{"text":"Burgers are average and overpriced. I had high hopes for this place. It's cute on the inside and fun to sit on the patio in the summer. I've been here a couple times hoping to be wow'd by a burger, but I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Didn't think the burgers were anything special. Thought it was over priced compared to the quality of the burger. It's just like another habit burger."}
{"text":"Ordering was pretty easy, but I didn't realize the fries were so huge and I got the \"smallest\" size! Too much, though I guess the price of them would have been a hint. Don't get me wrong, the fries are pretty good, but there were enough there for 2 people, if not more. Far too many, I wish they had a smaller size.  I also thought I had ordered the BurgerFi Burger, yet I got a double burger (which is the default choice - just like 5 Guys - terrible). Too much burger for me - I didn't catch it by price, only until the food came. The burger itself was mostly good (as mentioned I got a double accidentally). I barely could taste the BurgerFi sauce, but what was there was good (seems it was only in the middle of the burger from what I could tell).  I will probably go there again, but make sure I get the single and probably do without the fries. No only due to my diet but also they are far too big a side for me."}
{"text":"We have lived only a half mile from this place since they opened 4 years ago.  Have driven by many times and wondered what this place is.  Tonight we decided to eat dinner there with some family.  Undeniably one of the best Cheeseburgers I have eaten in many years.  The quality and freshness of the burgers are awesome.  The french fries with Parmesan + Herb was splendid.  The onion rings were huge and delicious.    The decor was modern and decorative.  The service was fast and friendly. The restaurant was immaculately clean and pristine.  We will definitely be making this great eatery one of our regular spots to eat and highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I had the BurgerFi burger, fries and onion rings. The burgers are not huge but they are big enough. Burger was very good. Lots of choices on the menu, especially for fries. Onion rings are HUGE and the best I have had in a long time. You get a massive quantity of fries, beware when ordering! They have two freestyle machines, which I appreciate  since just one can be annoying in a busy place like this. Service was great on a Sunday. They have draft beers and wine. Overall, pricey but I felt it is worth a treat on occasion. I shall return!"}
{"text":"Mmmm I'll be wanting this every time I want a burger. We got 2 burgerfi cheese burgers, 1 add mushrooms and aioli .. The mushrooms or maybe the aioli was kind of salty, but it was still delish. We also got Parmesan herb fries and a chocolate shake. Next time I would split the burger (it was double patty). Fries and shake on point Clean place and fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"A step above Burger King. My boyfriend and I went here one night. The atmosphere is pleasant, and the staff seemed friendly. The food was not worth the wait or money. My boyfriend had to send back his burger 3 times. The first time we notified the staff prior, because we saw the receipt did not show the correct item...but that didn't seem to help. The second time they forgot one of the extra patties, and the third time the burger was cold and the cheese wasn't melted. When he got his fourth burger the employee gave unnecessary attitude by saying, \"I hope it's right this time,\" and shoved the burger at him. We never raised our voices and stayed relaxed and chill the whole time. I suggest going next door to Devil's Advocate for a far better burger and experience."}
{"text":"So I tried this place the other day because it came up on hot and new!  I have always been doubtful of any fast-casual burger joints because I feel like they are all trying to do the in n out and shake shack thing.  This place is totally doing that.   Their burger wasn't bad and the fries were pretty good but, everything is a la carte so it adds up quickly.  Like I said, I was impressed by the fries as well as the Burger-Fi sauce! Better than most \"spreads\" or special sauces for sure.   I don't fault this place for the food but where I do fault it is for lack of originality. It is the exact same thing as shack shack with a different name.   With places like Hopdoddy where you get the fast-casual experience with the gourmet burgers, I'm surprised there are so many places like this still popping up.  BB's Rating: Not bad but, Not Original Either"}
{"text":"Great price and menu, though I'd love if they'd add some honey mustard ;) Their burgers always seem to look a little sloppy, but the flavor is good. Sides are large and onion rings and fries have just the right amount of seasoning. Worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Grand Opening today of BURGERFI, in Mentor.  Lines were out the door, as to be expected.  Things moved fairly quickly. The service was good. We ordered 2 build a burgers, a plain hot dog, the onion rings and fries, and 2 drinks. I was pretty disappointed when I picked up our tray.  The burgers are tiny. As in kid sized burgers.And the toppings very sparse. Barely anything on it.  And there really wasn't much flavor at all..  The onion rings were probably the best part of the meal.   Probably won't return.  There are plenty of other great places (non chain), to get a great burger in Mentor.  As for being good for kids, no kids meals?"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Froze every time the door opened.  Pricey for what you get.  35 for two burgers, two onion rings, Diet Coke & a milkshake."}
{"text":"Had the double cheese burger and fries.  Food was good.  Not sure it was remarkable enough to stand out from other burger joints...but as I said, it was good.  A few observations...  - They don't have iced tea.  They have soda machines that probably make more than 100 different types of soda...but no tea...what's up with that?  - Food came out slow.  Lots of people working there...but food takes a little time...more time than similar restaurants.  - I didn't order the onion rings but I saw them.  They're really thiiiiccccckkkk sliced.  Personally, that's not in my wheel house.  They looked good, but I wouldn't order them.  - For whatever reason the hamburger bun seemed oddly small.  Maybe it was just me.  Not a 4, not a 3...call it a 3.5."}
{"text":"Hands Down, the Best! Oddly reminiscent of the defunct Coal Burger, BurgerFi is probably the best burger joint I've been to in a while. Be aware, they cook in peanut oil for those with allergies. The vibe was calm and modern from the furniture, décor, and Top 40 Hits playing above you. The staff as super friendly and assistive for newcomers unfamiliar with these monstrous looking burgers. The food is amazing! They grill their burgers just so that they're not hard or undercooked."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Try the CEO. it's a taste sensation. The hand cut French fries are the best. You haven't had proper tasting French fries until you've had these. Fast and friendly service. This is on my \"do not miss\" list when looking for a great burger in south Mesa or north Gilbert."}
