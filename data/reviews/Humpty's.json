{"text":"Nice enough staff but really over priced for the small portion of food they offer. Was still hungry after eating what little I had. Was craving steak, but didn't want to eat at one of the more expensive steak houses...thought I'd go here. Ordered a 4oz steak, with 6 shrimp on a skewer, it came with 10 dinky potato wedges and one itty bitty bowl of coleslaw for $20. Waste of money. I should of went to one of the steak houses and paid $30 for a satisfying meal. What a jip."}
{"text":"Have been to this location twice now in the evenings. Much cleaner (because its newer) than other Humpty's location. I do sometimes find the size of their menu a bit overwhelming but it is great if you are looking for a range of choice. I find some of their food to have a real \"home cooked\" comfort food feel to it but then other stuff misses the mark by adding a melted cheese whiz sauce to it (for example).

The service at this location is prompt (it is never busy when we are there) although the waitresses don't seem to have a ton of experience (the one we had Friday asked the other waitress when we arrived if \"this one\" (pointing at us) is her turn or the other girls turn. I've never been referred to as a \"this\" before.

Prices are reasonable and anywhere you can get an all day breakfast is a good thing."}
{"text":"Quick preface: Review should be a negative! 

There's a first time for everything. Yes that quote is a clich√©, but I think it suits what happened at this restaurant. We came in, were seated, drinks had been ordered and came quickly afterwards, but then nothing... After 45 minutes of waiting I politely went up to the counter and asked if they had forgotten about us, the waitress said that she actually doesn't work there (whatever that means - obviously she's working there) muttered something further but barely audible and snuck to the back. After another 20 minutes we decided that indeed we had been completely forgotten, so we got up and left. Like I said, \"first time for everything\".

Worst Service we've ever experienced. We were very proud that our two kids sat and coloured for the 65 minutes that we had sat there. 

I'm not one to not return to places because of a single incident or poor experience, but in this case I'm making an exception. I'm never returning to Humpty's again."}
{"text":"This place was one of our faves for a go to for bacon and eggs.
The past 2 times we have gone, we have noticed a huge decline in standards. This place used to be top notch clean, plenty of servers, and decent cooks. Now its a pig sty, with no servers and new owners.
What a sad change.
I hope the new owners read this and wake up. This place was successful because of the people that ran it. 
Our food took 1 hr to come to the table, even though they were only 5 tables. and when it did it was just food for two of our kids ( aged 3 and 6). The third one (aged 2)  and ourselves had to wait an additional 15 minutes for ours. Our son loved watching  his brothers eat without him... Not. 
When ours did arrive my husbands coleslaw needed to be replaced twice because it was browning, after the second we said forget it.
When we complained to the nice server about how crazy it was to only feed two kids and how long it took. she apologized. Told us she would talk to new management and see what she could do. When the bill came we were being charged for the kids( its Friday night kids eat free when you order adult entree so 2 of them should be free) . We told her this and she changed it, then went to her owner. At no point did he feel it important to come talk to us and try to ease our concerns. This buddy , is bad business practice. 
I'm am so saddened by this place and the sudden decrease of service and cleanliness. We will never go back while its under this management.
Good luck"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, however, I LOVE going out for breakfast; and I've discovered that trying to find a small independently owned place in the SE quadrant that we live in; is not easy.  We've eaten at Humpty's a couple of times; found it average, and not much to write about - until our last visit.

I LOVE Eggs Benedict. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them.  I'd eat Hollandaise sauce with a spoon if you served it on the menu I love it so much.  Sure it's not healthy but truth be told - I don't care.  So when I go for breakfast, if Eggs Benny are on the menu chances are, I'll order them.

The first two visits to this restaurant were fine.  The food was fine, the coffee was fine...It stayed in our repertoire for days when we didn't want to make breakfast at home - until THIS time.  Third time is definitely NOT a charm for this restaurant.

A near empty restaurant, and poor slow service greeted us the minute we sat down.  That coffee which had been fine, now turned terrible.  The Benny I've ordered in the past (yolks ALWAYS medium) was terrible.  I know that their hollandaise is not from scratch, so it's odd they screwed it up.  Yolks? ROCK HARD despite the fact I was asked.  The hubby's simple breakfast wasn't much better.  He was served rye toast that tasted like the bottom of a shoe.  It was obviously stale and had no flavour whatsoever.  For the record?  His yolks were perfect.

What topped off this terrible meal was the lack of service from our \"server\" food was dropped off, and we never saw her again until she brought the cheque, and she barely thanked us at that time. Perhaps my dissapointed attitude about my meal was enough to keep her away.  

All in all?  It was 30 minutes, and $30 dollars I will never get back."}

This is a gem of a Humpty's.  While the menus area the same, the service differs greatly between locations.  In contrast to the Millrise location, this one is fresh and new and service was great when we went.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awful.   

Service: was very rushed.   It felt like I was in a 5K run water station.   

Food: Was bland, without flavor and downright boring.   
We had he banana bread french toast and the Denver wrap.   Had to add orange marmalade to the bread and drowned the wrap in ketchup and sour cream.    
The orange slice tasted like day old fish.   

There was a stack of napkins that fell on the dirty floor and the waitress picked them up and placed the fallen napkins back in the pile.   Other than that disgusting act, the restaurant appeared to be clean.   


Not even worth half the price , which was far too pricey to begin with."}
