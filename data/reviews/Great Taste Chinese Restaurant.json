{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet, but since I got there near the end of the lunch time most of the food was gone. I was hoping that they would refill it sometime, but they didn't. I could see that there used to be a lot of good food.   Overall, the food was good three stars (normal/good for a buffet), the deserts were terrible (I only tried the cakes and cream puff), and the bubble tea was terrible as well. Go for the lunch buffet, it's definitely worth it if you get there when all the food is out."}
{"text":"I have small children. If you say you our food will be here in 30 minutes and it's been over an hour, how about a phone call for a heads up.  I'll never order from them again."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant through Yelp and decided to try it out when we visited Calgary for a trip from Vancouver. We were travelling with 4 children and 2 grandparents and because my mother in law cannot eat any Canadian food (Chinese Canadian born in Beijing) we decided to go to Chinese food for a dinner.  Taste:  I will give it 4 stars.  Dishes were served quickly and were very tasty.  We ordered xiao long bao (a type of steamed dumplings with hot soup and meat inside.) Those dumplings were surprisingly very good.  We felt they can even compete in Vancouver market.  We also ordered some greens, fried shrimp, and sweet and sour rock fish.  We ordered more dishes, and they were all very good.  Restaurant:  is quite filthy and bathrooms were filthy also. We ordered a bottle wine and one of the glass still had someone's lip stick stain... Yuck.  Turn table was also very filthy.    Service:  They definitely had to work extra hard having to serve the whole restaurant with only 3 servers, but I will say service was mediocre.    I will definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"After years of getting our bi-monthly order incorrect, tonight was the clincher! Ordered online at 10:06 pm Friday night, online website said open until 11. Waited one hour for food to be delivered, started calling at 11:05,  but nobody could be bothered to pick up the phone, though you know employees hadn't left promptly at 11. If my credit card is charged in the morning for food I never received, there will be hell to pay."}
{"text":"Their website makes it extremely easy to order online. I've ordered from them three times and they are, as people have said, speedy to Ohio City. The delivery guy is always pleasant. Definitely no complaints. It's not extraordinary food, but when you feel like Chinese, this is for sure the place.  Order the steamed dumplings served with a soy ginger sauce."}
{"text":"This is your prototypical dirty, cheap and fast chinese take out.  And they're open until like 11 during the weekdays which is a rarity downtown.  When you call in an order they don't even both to tell you how long it'll take b/c by the time walk downstairs from your apartment and get anywhere near the place your order is always ready.  Is this a bit shady?  Of course.  Gotta love it.  Typical gigantic chinese restaurant menu with dozens of items and some convoluted system of coded numbers and letters signifying which order, combination plate or whatever you ordered.  I've found the chow fun and the pot stickers to be pretty solid though.  For all the Kobayashis out there, they have a cheap lunch buffet as well."}
{"text":"I am currently living in Vancouver and am on a serious hunt for some amazing XLB, so while visiting home in Calgary my mom suggested we look and see if we can find something good here. Great Taste was one of the first to come up, and though reviews for their xlb were average.. we figured we would try. We were not disappointed! I was so very impressed with most of the items we ordered, including the XLB! So flavourful and a good-sized piece of pork inside, without the dumpling being too large to contain in a bite. We also ordered the green onion pancakes (so very good, great texture and flavour), the beef rice noodle dish (so amazing), kung pao chicken (not my favourite, but was good). It was a busy night but service was still decent, & prices were good.  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"My go to delivery when I'm in CLE on business when craving Chinese. They deliver to all downtown hotels, I order using the Eat24 App, haven't experience the long wait on delivery or bad service others has mentioned here. The place is cheap with large servings. I usually order the small size so I can get multiple entrees. I recommend any dishes with shrimp - The shrimp orders are very generous with large shrimps and crunchy veggies even the small size orders. The dishes are not oily, over cooked or drowning in sauce which I prefer! They also have diet section if you just want steamed veggies and protein.  The only annoying thing is that they don't make their dishes very spicy even if you request 'very hot'."}
{"text":"Thought it was hard to mess up fried Chinese food. I was wrong. Had the egg rolls, crab rangoon and general tsaos chicken. No flavor and no spice. Might be cheap. But will definitely not order again."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst Chinese places I've ever had. My Kung-Pao Shrimp tasted nothing like it should and had completely different ingredients than are normally used, including no peanuts. I asked for it very hot and it wasn't spicy at all. The steamed dumplings were not very good either. The only reason I gave it a 2nd star is because it arrived within 45 minutes and they had convenient online ordering."}
{"text":"Place is a joke. Placed an order at 7:30, 8:30 rolls buy and nothing. Call them and they said that they delivered but no one answered. Said they'd redeliver. Driver call and said he's in the lobby of the hotel I'm staying in.  I go to meet him there and no one was there. Talked to the receptionist and she said that there hasn't been any deliveries. Called the place back and they came up with some BS story saying that they came and even checked in with the receptionist.. Place order at your own expense."}
{"text":"Whenever I crave for Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao) I will only come to this restaurant. This place serves the best xiao long bao in the city. The wrapper is kind of thin, the filling is tasty and there is a lot of soup in the dumplings. The green onion pancakes are nice and crispy but it's on the greasy side. The beef and cucumber roll is yummy. The cucumbers and hosin sauce help to cut the grease and the pancake still has an addictive crunch. The smoked duck with tea flavor was pretty good it had a nice smoky flavor and the duck was fried to perfection it wasn't dry at all. It was over seasoned though and we were pretty thirsty afterwards.  Their menu is really big and the food is pretty decent overall."}
{"text":"Who said the bubble tea is not good!  I love it. I got the first one in the morning and come back in the after noon! The waitress is so nice to me. First I have the honeydew, and second I tried Thai tea favor. They all good!  I also like their black pepper chicken and wings. Not to hot for me, love it. Definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Currently best Chinese food in the city...hands down. The food was a fusion of Beijing, Shanghai and Szechuan. Something this city does not have (so I'm told). *Warning* for those who can't handle spice, this cuisine is not for you. I recommend going with 3 people if you want to try few dishes at the same time. The staff were pretty friendly and did not ignore when the booths and tables were filling up."}
{"text":"A month and a half on from the Great Flood, our go-to Chinese soup place, Calgary Court Café is still closed... so we decided to try this adjacent resto, Great Taste. This spot formerly housed the MBA Chinese BBQ restaurant, and based on my memory the current joint has a considerably different menu. The menu helpfully has lots of pictures to help you choose, with is good because the English translations for some dishes are laughable (\"Distiller's Brain Fillet\"). If you have a smartphone, the awesome free app Waygo can translate the Chinese for you on the fly, check it out!  There are a number of good lookin' pork belly pictures on the menu, and a wide variety of other meats in various spicy and savoury preparations.  But we were here for  soup, and they have several types including a penchant for dumplings, a nice change from the usual. Upon arrival though, the pork and snow cabbage soup was a bit strong on the oyster sauce, and the dumpling soup (with rather nice dumplings) rather weak on the broth.  The tables are missing the soya sauce, chili oil, red vinegar, etc. that Calgary Court Café has to jazz up the broth or noodles. So all in all, I'll probably be back to try some pork, but for soup I'll probably stick to CCC when it reopens."}
{"text":"Couldn't help but feel pretty icky while I ate. The restaurant still has dusty Christmas decorations up....it's January 26th The food isn't really authentic, spicy or tasty by any means. The dessert table is a joke.  The service was decent."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant. The menu is extensive. We had the smoked fish appetizer, soup dumplings, and Beijing style dumplings. All was great, but the soup dumplings were the best I've ever had. Fast service, too. I'm only in Calgary for the week, but I'd be happy to eat here every day."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the soup dumplings.  It wasn't out of the world amazing but it was tasty still.  I liked that they gave us some free red bean desert before we left."}
{"text":"I've tried nearly every item on their menu via delivery over 6 months and I can say Great Taste is affordable with some very good dishes, with convenient online food delivery.  What I love to order from here:  1. Singapore Mei-Fun (shrimp, roast pork, chicken included) 2. Chicken with Broccoli (quite healthy) 3. General Tso's Chicken (far from best but quite good) 4. Fries (can be soggy at times but it's convenient)  All the beef dishes and black bean sauce items I found to be inedible. Their fried chicken wings are those gigantic whole wings that I find to be quite gross."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Ginger beef it took an hour and half to arrive and when it did it was the wrong order when I rang Great Taste to tell them they were not very helpful and just kept saying it was the delivery drivers fault!! Between ringing the Chinese and the delivery people they finally agreed to send another ginger beef! When it arrived, 2 hours after I actually made the order, it was the same thing!! They may think it's ginger beef but beef is not white nor is it pink and goey!! I will never return here!!"}
{"text":"Good place to enjoy ur lunch w/ good price. More discount after 2pm. Food is good and always fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Chinese cuisine. Was very impressed with the space, the service and the food. Out of all the things we ordered, I personally liked the moo soo pork with crepes and the jellyfish best, but truly all of the 8 dishes or so were great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to mainland China 5 times. In Shanghai, the level of food quality and presentation is much higher than any Chinese restaurant I found in Canada - you can't really compare that aspect.  What I can do, is tell you what I thought about the food and service :)  Xiaolongbao, famous shanghai soup dumplings. I've had xiaolongbao at 4 different restaurants in Calgary and compared to the ones I had in Shangahi, the ones at Great Taste are the closest you will get to them in a Calgary restaurant. They even have crap xiaolongbao which is pretty cool although I didn't try them tonight.  Nai cha, their milk tea. Their milk tea was a cold version and served with ice. It was too sweet for my liking. I'd rather eat dinner here first then go to Calgary Court next door to satisfy my naicha craving if I had to.  Dan dan mien, their \"spicy\" miso based noodle soup is good. The flavour and richness compares to Chaya in Banff, but the noodles are different of course :)  Everything is is not bad. I still want to come back with an empty stomach and try out at least half of their menu, but I've got time :)  They have the widest selection of dishes I'd be able to order in Shanghai that I found in Calgary which is a good addition to the city. I was pretty happy and my wife is too.  The service was great and they speak mandarin which is also great because its somewhere I can practice ordering food."}
{"text":"this review will take anyone who actually thought i had decent taste (great taste, if you will.  BA DUM BUM!!) and cancel any thought of it.  i.love.this.place.  their lunch buffet is freaking fantastic.  actually, i'm kinda craving it right now, and that's unfortunate, since it's 3:30.  it's your typical fare you'd expect from a joint like this, but for some reason i love it.  things i make sure i hit up if i'm buffeting it up like a fattie:  the garlicy green beans the potatoes.   the fried, sugary sweet goodness of their general tso/garlicy chicken.  yum. dumplings.  of any kind. those funny bananas in that sugary red sauce.  mmm. tasty crap.  you can choose from the buffet for 'to go\" as well.  and you can pack a crapload into those styrofoam containers.  same price.  one of my coworkers always gets enough food that they have to staple it shut.  she eats it for days.  not overpriced.  greasy.  and frighteningly fast.  it's not a high class joint, so don't take your girl here with the ideas of romance and proposing.  she might clock you one.  but if ya wanna beef up those thighs, well, this is your place.  \"beef up those thighs\"??? ewww."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite authentic Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. It has a wide variety of food from hot to cold dishes. I like the menu layout, they have with lots of pretty pictures to help give a sense of what it looks like. I personally like their Mapo Tofu due to their numbing taste sensation from the sauce. Here are my recommended food menu items to try:  -Ho Fan -Xiao long bao -Chicken Taiwanese in hot pot -Beef & Cucumber Roll -Deep Fried Chinese Doughnut (Ask for the 3 sauces, Hoisin, Soy Sauce & Sesame)  The service and food delivery is quick. Be warned that this establishment can get busy frequently, make sure to book a reservation when coming in a party of 4+."}
{"text":"I moved in across the street a couple of months ago and have been hesitant to try Great Taste due to some harsh reviews. Nevertheless, my cravings took over tonight... I needed some pad thai and I needed it soon! So I ordered online for pick up. I got an order of crab rangoon along with some medium spiced pad thai. The order was ready in a timely 15 mins.   Both dishes were piping hot. The crab rangoon could have been crispier, but the filling was pretty good. I'd order them again if I was really wanting some. The pad thai was a generous portion, which I appreciated, and had good flavor. It wasn't as spicy as I'd hoped, but I think spice is always trial and error with new restaurants. It didn't come with a lime either, which is always a part of pad thai I look forward too. However, overall, it was pretty good! Not the best I've ever had, but definitley good for take out.   I think the trick here is to order for take out and not sit in... That way its guaranteed fresh!   Overall, I'll definitley order again."}
{"text":"Nice little buffet on E.12th for cheap. They have a $6.99 lunch buffet 11-3:30. Be careful though to check your bill. They tried to add a hot tea to my tab which I did not order. No biggie, I caught it.  Not the largest selection but the flavors were there. They have your typical chinese option such as crab rangoon, eggrolls, lo mein, chicken assortments, etc. I will be back for a filling meal when I have a few minutes to spare. I like to get my money's worth haha."}
{"text":"Here is the odd part of this trip. Usually you get good service with awful food. This is the exception, the food was good but there was no service. There was some food when we walked in but then it disappeared. I got a large plate at first and got my fill but my friend eats smaller plates. We were looking at Sphere apartments when we walked into finding this place. The price was good for the lunch and we had 50 minutes before our next tour at the 9. There was only four other people and then the lady who sat us and then the rest of the employees at a long table eating. There was certainly going to be no more food since they were all having their own lunch. No refills and nobody ever cleared our plates. So, sadly, good food but they did not cook any more and I left unsatisfied and my friend left hungry. Probably will not return which is a shame."}
{"text":"I come here often with clients.  Service: 3.5 stars you get the service you need to ask for it.  Dinning: 4.5 stars (clean) Food: 4.5 stars.  Washroom: 3 stars This place don't look like much from the outside but it offer both southern & northern Chinese food spicy & not spicy. You will find one of the largest selections any restaurant will offer. These combination is not easy for one chef to make and I have tried almost all the dishes to my amazement it was all done very well food was ver tasty and full of the right flavour. Meats well seasoned with the right spice. Most of my clients that are little picky, can't decide or not knowing what they want this is a good choice.  They also have large tables to accommodate bigger groups."}
{"text":"Yum! We have been here twice and enjoyed it both times. Our server was friendly and helped us make our choices since we didn't really know what to get. The Chinese broccoli with garlic was so good."}
{"text":"Soup Dumplings!  go here and order the steamed shanghai pork dumplings (C02).  amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a great all around Chinese restaurant serving different provincial styles of food... From Cantonese to Szechwan to Shanghainese.  Our large group sampled all styles of foods from xiao long bao (excellent!!) to Cantonese chow fun, mapo tofu, to steamed chicken, and all met to our high expectations on flavor and authenticity. The restaurant is decently sized and can accommodate large groups and very presentable. The wait staff are nice and give good recommendations based on your preferences. Parking is mostly street side only, so can be a bit challenging. A definite return is in order on our next trip to Calgary."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a very cheap delivery fee. Specifically loved the General Tso's Chicken! The delivery fee ($2) was very cheap since we didn't want to walk anywhere. We asked locals if there was any good Chinese food anywhere, and they said no. How wrong they were! We ordered on the phone and had to repeat things about three times because the staff spoke minimal English, but it wasn't a big deal. The food got to our hotel hot and quickly. We would definitely come here again!!! It had a lot of great taste. (:"}
{"text":"I've been getting delivery from here sporadically for the past year, wow has this place declined. I put in an order on a Sunday, it was here in a good amount of time thirty minutes or so.  Egg roll: completely flavorless I took one bite and threw it out  Spring roll: same as above but it was a rank flavor, just gross.  Crab Ragoon: this one hurts bc they had a good dish here in the past. Over cooked, the filling bubbled up and burnt.  Mongolian beef: it was ok, spicy enough but the meat was so chewy and gamey I couldn't eat it, the rest was good."}
{"text":"Great Taste is located in Calgary Chinatown.  After a week of meat-centric meals at Banff we had craving for some good Chinese food.  Yelp led to back to downtown Calgary.  We also had to go through there anyways for the airport back to the USA.  The restaurant is located in Calgary's Chinatown, which is really just a few blocks from downtown.  Virtually no street parking, but on weekends lots of nearby pay lots for 3.00 CAD all day flat rate.  Its a pretty large restaurant, but the menu is what's impressive.  Its physically large and has a mix of Shanghai-style, Szechuan, and some Canton-style dishes.  Limited live oysters, shrimp, and clams too.  They include frog too so it must be authentic!  Overall 4 stars.  Great Taste tastes great, especially the live shrimp.  At 25.00 CAD/lb the boiled shrimp was so smooth, firm, and sweet.  All that's needed is some soy vinegar dip.  Much cheaper than what we had in Richmond Vancouver, and about the same good quality.  The next best dish turned out to be the simple garlic stir-fried Gai-Lan - crunchy, slightly oily, and so badly needed since we did not eat too many veggies over the past week.  Pork wontons with spicy chili oil were decent - I always like the smooth skin of the wrappers and the kick from the sauce.  The last two dishes were mediocre.  Shanghai pan-fried pork dumplings were small and didn't have that oily texture I like.  In fact, the wrapper was on the dry side.  The 5-spice sliced beef noodle soup had tender and flavorful beef and chewy noodles; however, the soup was on the saltier side.  If we come back to Calgary we will definitely consider coming back to Great Taste."}
{"text":"They offer a northern China cuisine with more spicy dishes which are tasty. Their Shanghai pork dumplings (XLB) were on the small size but flavorful. Salt and pepper squid was tender but not a large serving. They had dim sum on the menu however we were there for dinner. The restaurant will fill quickly with limited tables. It's a good change to your typical canto. type restaurants."}
{"text":"The quality of food there has definitely gone downhill over time. The portion of the dishes they serve is relatively small for the amount of money paid, and so far I haven't really found any real authentic dish there that would keep me going back. Anyway, I haven't been there in a long time. Today my coworkers wanted to have lunch there and dragged me along, I thought I would give it one more chance. Bad idea. The stir fired lamb we ordered has tiny sharp bones mixed together with the meat. Without knowing it, I accidentally bite the sharp bone and bled my gum. Ouch. Guess this is the last time I would ever come here. One star for the poor food preparation and handling."}
{"text":"It's cheap but good Chinese food that'll give you plenty of leftovers. I'm a fan.  I ordered through Eat24 at 8:45 on a Saturday night and my food was estimated at 45-60 minutes, fine with me. I was delighted that it arrived by 9:05 and was piping hot.  I ordered a PuPu platter for some variety and was not disappointed. Two huge, fresh pork egg rolls, 2 flavorful and crisp crab rangoon (you could see and taste the crab and scallion!), 2 meaty and rich fried wontons, two pork spare ribs (the only disappointment, tasted old and did not have that nice charred BBQ glaze), 2 tender and large teriyaki steak skewers, two moist and flavorful chicken teriyaki sticks (which were breaded and fried first and then sauced), and a handful of \"chicken tenders\" which were actually sweet and sour chicken nuggets with the iconic red glaze.  I also tested their wonton and egg drop soup which was slightly bland and the wontons nothing special. For an entree I got the General Tso's Chicken and indicated hot for level of spicy - it was more sour than spicy. Not bad, but not something I'd get again. It was accompanied by the usual few crowns of slightly undercooked broccoli and a pile of pork fried rice. The rice was yellow like Spanish rice, but didn't have much flavor either way and all the veggies were dried out as well as the pork chunks.  The minor gripes aside, the PuPu platter was worth all $10 in my book. The whole bill came to about $25 and I easily have enough leftovers for 2 meals. I'd definitely order from them again if I'm ever trapped in a Cleveland hotel again!"}
{"text":"Not great, but good food. Reasonable delivery time. I'm stayin at the Hampton Downtown Cleveland. They are good enough that I ordered from them two nights while staying here. Was not very impressed with either the egg drop or wonton soup. Its just typical westernized Chinese food. Real good prices tho."}
{"text":"Being in Chinatown, we were initially going to have dinner at Calgary Court again, but on a whim decided upon this restaurant as it was right next door and we've never been here before!  It seemed to have pretty good volume so we decided to give it a try.  Atmosphere: 3/5  Overall brightly lit and neat.  It wasn't too busy but there were already a few tables.  Some customers seem to come quite regularly.  We were seated at a booth table near the window.  Unfortunately, the tables were somehow very low compared to the chairs so we had to hunch quite a bit forward to eat.  Located conveniently in Chinatown but parking can be a bit of a challenge as usual, but not bad for a weeknight.  Food: 3/5  On the menu, there are quite a number of traditional chinese dishes with some focus on shanghai dishes.  For dinner, I opted for something simple- the shredded pork and snow cabbage rice noodle soup.  Overall adequate size. However, there was quite a bit of sauce in the soup that was not very mixed in and made it quite salty.  There are  quite a few other menu items, and if we had a bigger group, I wouldn't mind trying some of the shanghai style dim sum  Service: 3.5/5 adequate, overall friendly  Price: 3.5/5  Reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food  Overall: 3.5/5  Overall a good alternative for Chinese food here located in chinatown; would love to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Well, it arrived, I can give them a star for that... I ordered using Eat24, and I'll give credit that it came earlier than expected. That being said, I'm kind of shocked that it wasn't hot, barely warm even.  I also selected the spice factor at very spicy, as high as it could be, and this was so bland a toddler could have eaten it. it bordered on sweet even.  I ordered Gen Tso tofu and garlic tofu, lunch and dinner, if you will.  After one was cold and bland I sampled the other, just in case.  The 2 were virtually interchangeable.  Only difference was the garlic sauce was thin and not as congealed as the Gen tso's.  I paid extra on one dish for lo mein, and the amount was not worth it in comparison the the rice that would have been included.  The veggie spring rolls were mush inside.  Over all I was completely disappointing and will stick with Emperors palace or Ty Fun when I need my fix."}
{"text":"XLBs were amazing! Came back for supper and tried the ma po tofu, kung pao chicken and green beans - comfort food and it was all great! The cumin lamb skewers were just like I had in China. :) service was great and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food smells questionable and I suspect they reuse the oil. My skin always breaks out after eating here. I tried giving them several chances but now finally giving up. This is what happens when restaurants take shortcuts to improve profit margins."}
{"text":"Best place to have a taste of china right in the city, with the cities best ??? but come before the crowds"}
{"text":"This is review is ONLY for the soup dumplings (xiao long bao).    And WOW.  We are ALWAYS on a quest for good soup dumplings, and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality here.  Restaurant is on a quiet street.  Plenty of street parking all within a couple of blocks.  The place is large with many tables for large parties.  They even had some room dividers that I'm sure can function for more private parties.    Soup dumplings were amazing.  Casing was not too thin, not too thick.  Good portion of meat inside, and the soup was delicious and well measured.  Perfect ratio all around.  Needless to say, I think we ordered 3 servings each?  Would DEFINITELY go back again!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the Sphere building which is previously The Chesterfield Building that had 78 code violations. If anyone ever seen the amount of asbestos & bugs in this building, they would never eat here. I made the mistake once And only once......."}
{"text":"Great taste my ass. Is this a tv dinner? The egg rolls were decent, the crab Rangoon didn't really even have filling, the general tso's chicken tastes dry and cheap..and its still pink inside!! We are considering using the food to mix in our Dog's food.. But that would be cruel."}
{"text":"If you're trying to order quick and cheap Chinese food this is your place to go. Great Taste? More like tasteless. I was too worried to order anything with meat in it because the photos made it look not so good. I ordered vegetable lo mein, hot & sour soup and white rice. I ended up throwing out the soup after one bite. It was horrible compared to other Chinese restaurants. Everything else was bland and only tasted good after covering it in tons of soy sauce and duck sauce. The only other positive is that I got my food after ordering it within 30 minutes.   I'll probably be getting my Chinese delivery elsewhere."}
{"text":"Loooooove this place. Every time I go I have a great time and good food. Usually go during buffet hours, which is awesome because you get a little bit of everything for about $6-7 a person. Meals here are great too. This is a for sure go to when you're craving anything and everything. (:"}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Good selection of food.  Beef with Chinese broccoli was very salty and the beef was not very tender but overall the dish was ok. The eggplant with minced pork was fairly bland and greased but again, the dish was ok.  The pork soup dumplings were very tasty but the soy sauce only had 2 slivers of ginger.  The Shanghai pan-fried dumplings were very dry but my son really enjoyed them.  The beer selection was poor.  Maybe choosing different main courses next time would be better"}
{"text":"I've ordered food from here a few times, can't really complain about it. Sometimes it's a little bland. It's not the best Chinese food I've had but not the worst either.  The location is within a convenient walking distance, so that is why I come back when I'm randomly craving Chinese food. Prices and portion sizes are reasonable. Service is okay, and I've never had an issue.  Flavor is just OK, could be better and could be worse but it does the job. I've heard good things about their buffet so I will try that out sometime."}
{"text":"I've been ordering delivery from this place for years. They're hit or miss. Sometimes the food is AMAZING. Other times, its HORRIBLE. The only exceptions to that, are the lo mein and fried rice; always spectacular.  For the first time today, I tried their Pad Thai... simply awful. If I weren't so lazy and hate confrontation, I'd be calling asking for my money back. First of all... the description depicts something completely different. This is not what I thought I was ordering. And it contains shrimp... no where in the description did it mention shrimp. Just terrible. VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok food but deplorable service. If you want to feel like an animal that has to bark and yell to get any kind of service this place is for you. Getting any attention is like pulling teeth, ordering, or asking for the bill etc.  If there is a line up to get in you might as well forget about it. People will push the people already in line out of their way and clamor their way to the front of the line and steal the spots that should be for the decent people waiting in line. This restaurant caters to the most inconsiderate, obnoxious, rude people this city had to offer and if your not among them you will be invisible to them even when u r the first one in line n standing right in front of them.  Yes, one word - ridiculous.  I will not go there again.  There r many other places where serve the homeland Chinese food I crave for and offer civilized customer service."}
{"text":"For Calgary... decent! I didn't know you could get soup dumplings in this town. We're getting more cosmopolitan I guess. I've had more flavorful xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), but I'm just happy enough I found a place that serves 'em. 4 stars.  I'm on the hunt for more places in town. Will keep you posted."}
{"text":"I've been to Great Taste twice. The second time was much better because based on the Yelp reviews, I knew what to order.   The smoked duck and fish mah soup was a HIT! The duck was so flavourful and meaty! The skin was crispy and the side of salt brought out the flavour of the meat. I enjoyed the four little white buns, which I used to make mini duck sandwiches.  The soup was lovely - the crab was fresh and sweet. The flavours were delicate.   Service was good. The restaurant was quiet, so the two lone servers were attentive and polite.   I'll be back for the cumin ribs and hot and sour soup... and anything else that you Yelpers recommend."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery to Ohio City.  The food is good. Not terrific, probably not extremely authentic, but good and cheap.    I definitely recommend the Crab Rangoons. The won-ton soup was great too.  The ginger chicken had celery in it - which I HATE - so I won't order that again, but that's just personal preference.    Will definitely order from this place again when I'm in the mood for some cheap Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a bite of cheap Chinese food. I got chicken with broccoli. The broccoli was fresh and the chicken was fairly tender. The sauce left a bit to be desired - didn't have much taste. I'd be willing to give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"COME IN BEFORE THE HOARD COMES. Seriously, we beat the rush by five minutes at 1130 and saw an empty restaurant be filled tot he brim in the span of the next 15 minutes.  Xiao long bao here is ok - a bit small, not quite as soupy as I would like and a few of them leaked. Tasted good though. The noodle soups are relatively cheap and affordable - My wife got the Shanghai wonton noodle soup - good wontons and light broth with excellent noodles. I got the five spice beef noodle soup (it's not spicy). The beef is very punchy and packed with flavor, though you don't get that many slices. The broth is very light and clean tasting, yet very flavorful, one of the best I've had.   They have a lot of lunch specials too that include soup + a drink for less than $10, so if you want more than just a bowl of noodle soup, they got your lunch taken care of."}
{"text":"We're originally from Hong Kong and their food were very traditional. Service is great as well, our server was really friendly. Will definitely come back whenever we visit Calgary."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for the Chinese New Year a couple weekends ago, as a result the restaurant was buzzing and lots of people coming and going!   We sat down and looked at the extensive menu, I have eaten at \"Chinese\" restaurants before, but never a more authentic one like this. We ended up ordering the cold duck, tofu with preserved egg and frog soup! We both commented that the food we ordered was quite spicy, so be wary if you come here to make sure you know the spice levels and maybe avoid certain dishes. The first dishes that came to use were the cold duck and the marinated tofu with preserved egg. The egg was all black (apparently they use crushed limestone to make it that color), but it did not taste like lime. It had gelled so the texture was not that of a normal cooked egg. The tofu had a spicy marinade/sauce on it and wasn't too bad! It was a soft tofu so easy to eat but hard to grab with chopsticks. The duck was very tasty, at times you needed to be careful as some bone was still left on it. Next the frog soup came out in an elevated meta bowl with a small burner underneath to keep it warm. The broth was spicy, so be wary, and had peppers, onions and frog legs. I personally enjoyed this the most out of the three dishes as it lots of flavor and the frog legs were nice and plump. I just would want it less spicy as I ended up ingesting some of peppers. Overall it was a new experience for me, I wouldn't say all the dishes were my favorite, but I would be willing to go back and try some others to get a better sense of the food! Despite the busy time of day the waitress we had was attentive and made sure we had all our dishes and were satisfied."}
{"text":"On a holiday, you can always count on the local Chinese restaurant to be open for business.  After a terrible rain delay at the ballpark and zero food, my husband and I were soaking wet, tired, irritated, and starving.  Enter: Great Taste.  We searched Yelp for the nearest Chinese joint once we entered the car and Great Taste was it.  It's a few blocks south of the ballpark so it's within walking distance.    We stopped in for takeout around 9:45 p.m. because we just wanted to get back to our Airbnb and relax with our dinner.  They had a huge menu that included lunch and dinner specials.  We both ordered one of the dinner combos: Mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken.  Both specials came with an egg roll (you can ask for a veggie one if you like, which I did).    Like other reviewers, the food was kind of bland.  I'm used to Mongolian beef having a strong soy/teriyaki flavor and this didn't really do it for me.  The beef was also a *bit* fatty, but maybe that had to do with the time of day we were ordering.  My husband's sweet and sour chicken was a bit better but the pieces were a bit soft.  I wish I had ordered that instead of my selection.  The egg roll was good but you have to grab your own sweet and sour sauce if you're a takeout customer, which I didn't do, so I was sad and didn't eat all of it.  This was a decent place to order from.  Not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  They have a buffet during the day which might be awesome so try that.  The takeout was quick in coming (we only waited like 10 minutes) and everyone was really nice."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and was impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and friendly staff for a Chinese restaurant.  We got there a little before 5 when the place was empty and then the entire place filled up within 10-15 minutes of being there. I would try to visit at off hours to avoid the crowds.   We tried to xiao long bao - soup dumplings, preserved egg congee, braised pork, and stir fried eggplant. It's difficult to find good XLB in Calgary and I think that this place does a decent job. I would have appreciated a spoon with the dish though.   The congee was nothing special but the small was big enough for the two of us. It tasted a bit... Bland. I've had better congee at many other places, I would not recommend it here.   The eggplant was my favourite dish from my visit. It was a bit on the salty side but perfect with congee (and probably a rice dish too). The sauce was good and the eggplant was served hot. Yum!  The braised pork was served with broccoli which I thought was really random but I thought maybe it's to set off the greasiness. The pork was more than 50% fat and too mushy for me, I picked at the meaty parts and left the rest. To be fair, I'm not sure what the authentic dish is supposed to be like because I'm not chinese, but it just wasn't for me.   Service was great, people regularly filling our teapot without us having to wave anyone down. When we were ready to leave, they were prompt on bringing us our bill. I would try again for some other dishes."}
{"text":"Tasty food at least in my eyes. We were bored and decided to drive down to Calgary for amusement. After a short decision on where to eat we ended up here.  I found the name cheesy but what Chinese restaurant doesn't have a funny names at times. We ordered a variety of snacks and some you just can't get in edmonton. They were tasty. Service was fast and it wasn't much of a wait with so many people frequenting the establishment.   The salted fried egg yolk tofu was simply divine and the Tianjin noodles literally was so spicy we felt as fried as the tofu lol. The soup dumpling was pleasantly surprising as it was easy to eat without falling apart and the wrapping was just strong enough to not break and spill all over.  Was impressed will visit again"}
{"text":"We ordered the pork soup dumplings which were absolutely worth the hype. We also ordered the beef rolls which were good when hot but not as tasty cold. We had fresh steamed oysters with ginger and green onion. The oysters we got were fresh and large enough to charge 5 dollars each.  However, ocassionally there was a bitter aftertaste. I'm not quite sure why. I also wouldn't recommend the ginger combination.   The 5 spice beef soup we got was a light meal with springy noodles and a simple chicken stock. It wasn't what I was expecting because the beef soups I've had in the past had very flavourful spiced stocks.   The pea tips were good but it seemed really overpriced for ~$16.   The meal ended nicely with coconut jello.  The service was also good but the waitresses weren't always fluent in english."}
{"text":"From the noodles, to the dim-sum, to the dinner plates, it is clearly a Shanghainese restaurant that should brand it more clearly as such because there is a clear lack of these in Calgary. The food tastes authentic - not the best I've tried by a mile, but having lived in Vancouver and been to Shanghai it's hard to top that. The only major knock I have is in the Shanghai dumplings, which while the wrapping was solid and the broth was excellent, the actual meat is consistently too \"mushy\".  However, decent Shanghai food in Calgary for good prices is very hard to find and for that it deserves a strong four stars. The place is also tidy and clean with a solidly designed menu that contains pictures of most of the items.  I'm also not sure what is so \"deplorable\" about the service according to another review, as having been here three times I've always been served and catered to reasonably and as expected."}
{"text":"Decent buffet: not oversalted, and most importantly for me didn't make me feel sick or have overactive bowels afterwards!  And also apparently lunch buffet is discounted after 2pm till the end of lunchtime."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery here and the service was terrible. The delivery guy was extremely rude. The food is just \"OK\", When you combine that with terrible service it gives you a pretty low quality on overall expereince. Today will be my last day ordering from this place."}
{"text":"Really excellent and authentic Chinese food. Ever since we spent a month traveling China we have been unable to eat Chinese food at home in North America because the bastardization of westernized Chinese food is extremely unappealing after you've had the real thing. This was the first Chinese meal that I've felt compared to what we ate in China. The waitstaff was very friendly and don't forget to order soup dumplings, they're excellen!"}
{"text":"one of the best buffet I ever had. The waitress was very nice and the price was a steal. The food was always fresh and flavorfuI. i will be coming back more often"}
{"text":"During our visit in Calgary we discovered this authentic Chinese restaurant downtown. They seated us promptly but our order was not taken right away.  We noticed the place was very busy which made us think we made the right decision. The customers were mainly Chinese so again it made us think food were authentic.  The food was exquisite and each dish that we ordered had distinguish flavours. The prices were on a higher end and portion of food were not big. This is by far the best Chinese restaurant we had eaten in all of Alberta."}
{"text":"Decided too order here since they have mushroom fried rice. Never tried it and I was interested. Also ordered the hot general tso tofu. That was a touch rubbery so I took off one star. All in all it was good! Arrived earlier than grub hub quoted and was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this restaurant. The service was good for my friends, but not for me. I was left waiting for my meal for 30-45 minutes while my friends got two rounds of food. The food itself was okay, but not worth the wait. My friends said that they weren't impressed by their food either. The food is also pretty expensive for what you get; not worth the cost. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"For Canada Day dinner, I, the only non-Chinese member of the group I was with, was given the arduous task of picking a restaurant in Chinatown. I have eaten at most premises in Chinatown in the past, but they were never so exceptional that I would rush to recommend them. Hence, \"arduous task.\"   Anyway, I thought I would seek the sage advice of Urbanspoon and Yelp. This place sounded \"new\" to me, so I suggested it to my friends, who, coincidentally, have also never heard of it before.   Turns out we've all been here in the past, we just never remembered it was called \"Great Taste.\" The food is ok. The service is meh. It wasn't anything remarkable, really. In fact, most people usually forego this restaurant for Calgary Court, which stands just right beside it.   I wouldn't be surprised if I forget about my experience here not too long after and a few months from now \"Great Taste\" will seem like a new restaurant to me again.   But that's what this review is for."}
{"text":"I work on the same street as this place and sometimes go here for lunch! They have a wonderful lunch buffet that is only $6.95, and if you want to fill up a styrofoam to-go box with food to take out from the buffet it's only $6.80!  They have all your standard Chinese fare. (Crab Rangoon, Kung Pao Chicken, General Tso's, Beef with broccoli, chicken with mushroom, noodles, fried rice, soups, egg rolls, etc.)  The food is very tasty but of course has that overly salted taste that most Chinese food places have. It's definitely not very healthy but I go here when I want to have that guilty comfort food meal for lunch and it definitely fulfills my need! I never get a stomach ache or anything after I eat this food which obviously these hole-in-the-wall Chinese joints can sometimes do to you. (We've all been there!)  Anyway it's definitely a quick, filling, and  inexpensive lunch if you're working nearby!"}
{"text":"nice chinese restaurant has many kinds of foods. shanghai crab dumplings and beijing duck. Also has Sichuan food and all kinds of soup pot."}
{"text":"This was a really nice place for lunch. I had the \"noodles in spicy peanuts soup\" and I REALLY REALLY enjoyed it. I want to go back just for that. I think about this meal often.  Xiao long bao - YUM Pan-fried dumplings - good Shredded pork with chili - YUM  Overall, five stars for the delicious peanut soup alone."}
{"text":"Easily the best Chinese food in Calgary. The menu is very unique. The xiao long bao, soups, spicy chicken are must tries."}
{"text":"For the overall value, style, decor and menu selection---I say it's a cross between Shanghainese, Szechuan and typical chinese fav dishes, like the ma po tofu...taste good, while not great, makes this still worth repeating...despite the higher than expected prices in Chinatown, I'll be back.  Ordered the noodle soup with beef tendon brisket, for $8 pretty good value, nice chunks, about 3 of each but I liked the noodles; fluffy and cube shaped :)  diced cucumbers impressive.  chinese brocoll/ga lai tasted delicious to me after a week of no veggies lol.  accept credit.  good service, came in 30 min to closing, 10pm is way too early for my standards lol.  But it's bright and clean."}
{"text":"Great Taste is fortunately (or well, unfortunately, according to my waist) right below my apartment complex,so it's hard for me to say no to late night cravings after a night out on the town. It's a typical Chinese joint, the food isn't highest of quality but it's affordable and settles the craving. I always go for the lunch specials: Chicken and broccoli, or general tso's with lo mein, but they do servce dishes such as Pad Thai as well.   It does what it's supposed to do. It's not the fanciest Chinese place in Cle, but it's conveniently priced and has never disappointed."}
{"text":"We were there on a Sunday evening ahead without reservation. Since there were only two of us they gave us the only table that was available. It happened to be a for two near the door. Menu and tea arrived promptly. The server at the front desk took out order. We chatted and waited.   About half an hour after taking out order. The server at the front came to confirmed or order and said she'll follow up on it. Ten minutes later the first item appeared and the rest followed. We speculated that she had forgotten to place our order. But they were busy!  Based upon out observation we think the restaurant with only three servers was vastly short staffed.   The food is good enough to warrant giving the restaurant a second try."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant.  Amazing soup dumplings and their sweet & sour fish fillet is a great alternative to the pork version.  The waitresses here are very friendly and provide good service. Hesitantly highly recommended as they already are busy most nights."}
{"text":"Very mediocre Chinese.  Wife ordered General Tsos which was ok.  I ordered the Shrimp Mei Fun which was fairly tasteless until I drowned it in Soy Sauce.  The crab Rangoon was just bad.  Filling tasted odd and some of them weren't closed properly and the filling was gone.  The delivery person was very nice and very prompt and the prices were reasonable at least."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here for lunch when we feel like gorging ourselves and waddling back to the office. The buffet includes really good Westernized Chinese with a few surprises thrown in occasionally. My favorites include the green beans, ginger meatballs, and black pepper chicken. Their dessert buffet is particularly tempting, and features fresh and canned fruit, almond cookies, and Jello. Who doesn't have room for Jello- even after a huge buffet lunch?"}
{"text":"New Years hangover means Chinese delivery. Even better that you can order online! We live on the other side of downtown and the food arrived as ordered in just about 30 minutes! Maybe even a little less?   General Tsos tofu with an order of lo-mein. you can pick the level of spicy-ness, and I thought the medium was on the tamer side. Maybe need to order the \"hot\" next time... but really no complaints from us. We'll be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"Waste of money. Cold food. Bad smell. Lot of items though. If you just want to fill the stomach this is a great buffet for the money. But the food was so tasteless."}
{"text":"Always love bubble tea. Saw they had different flavors so I wanted to try. I asked basic questions, is it powder or juice? Girl couldn't answer and said she didn't know. I asked about the bubbles, hard or soft. She said they were freshest bubble!! She comes back and it's the worst flavor I've ever had, pineapple. The bubbles weren't edible and were so old they couldn't even be chewed. I asked to try another one since I didn't like it and she walked away. Won't be back!!! Bad taste and bad service."}
{"text":"I'm going to stay away from this place for a while. The food is decent, but the service is just plain bad. A few months ago I wasted my entire lunch break waiting for them to give me my food that I had ordered 20-30 minutes prior to going there. When I had no more time to wait, I just left without getting any food. I forgave that, and gave them another shot. Then today I ordered sesame tofu and got chicken instead. Not a big deal, but what if it was a vegetarian who ordered it? The staff is just not on point. So I'm going to wait a looooong time before I order from here again. Maybe by then there will be a new staff."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Marriott at Key Tower on business and wanted to get some Chinese food. Yea, I'm of Chinese descent, and yea I can discern to a point what is genuine or good Chinese food.. but when it comes to delivery, I really only want the \"Westernized\" menu items -- the fried rice, stir fried noodles, potstickers, egg rolls, etc.  Wasn't expecting much but was blown away. What I had (don't judge me, I eat a lot):  - Fried dumplings: arguably the best I've had in years -- handmade dumplings that are pan fried and not deep fried. Sauce that comes with it is also homemade and delicious - Egg rolls: standard, good - SHRIMP CHIPS!!! If you have ever had a chance to get these shrimpy tasting crispy delights, you will love them here (only $1.50!) - Fried rice: I had a special request to make this spicy and with Chinese style satay sauce. Without these additions it would have been only ok. I do love that they use Chinese BBQ pork in the fried rice since it's arguably the greatest flavor contributor.  - Dry sauteed green beans: stir fried grean beans that are fresh, juicy, and crunchy.   What blew me away was not only the quality of the food, but also the price. The food is dirt cheap, but still Great Taste :]!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food and it has taken over 2 hours to get here on a Thursday night. They hung up on me several times when I called and have been very rude. Will never order again. Would not recommend. Ice cold food when it arrived"}
{"text":"I used to patronize this establishment on a semi regular basis. Until my most recent visit during lunch I thought I saw something moving across the wall. Upon further examination I realized it was a cockroach. I moved to another table and flagged down a waitress. The waitress pulls out a washcloth and uses it to kill the cockroach on a table. She then uses the same rag to wipe off the same table. This place is unsanitary they also didn't have the common courtesy to make my meal on the house. I wouldn't recommend dinning here!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs!!! Decided to sample the appetizers and boy was that a mistake. Ordered vegetable & chicken egg rolls and they delivered all pork. The teriyaki beef was as tender as shoe leather and just as tasty. Don't get me started on the crab Rangoon!!! If you have no other options for places that will deliver I guess Order from here but don't expect to enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by Great Taste with a co-worker for lunch buffet. We were promptly seated and our drink orders were taken. They serve filtered water, which is what we both ordered.   The buffet offers a decent selection, but some of the food was cold. Many of the items were around room temperature, which I believe is a food safety violation. Also, some of the food, such as the mushrooms and chicken dish were pretty bland, in addition to being cold. The green beans, however, were hot, crispy, and delicious as was the pepper chicken.  On our way out, we paid and we were asked how the food was. My co-worker and I informed the worker that many of the dishes on the buffet were cold. She said she would check into the issue. I didn't get sick or anything afterward, but how hard is it to keep a buffet steaming hot?  If it's broken, fix it."}
{"text":"I was disappointed given such high reviews. I had to call over the server for a question. Call her again to give the order (menu was closed). Wait 20+ minutes to get my food at 5 pm when there are only a dozen people there. The wonton soup was nice but I really wanted the other soups that only came in family size, medium or large. The pan fried Shanghai pork dumplings had little taste to them. It was like eating fried bread. $16 later and I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places for Chinese food. What I like the most is that they have a huge menu (with pictures) so you can always try something new. Service is also fairly quick so you never have to wait too long for food even if you're stepping in for dinner on Fridays. Some tasty menu choices are: beef cucumber roll, cold pork skin, braised eggplant, and chili fish. So wear some loose pants and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is indeed a great tasting restaurant!!  This Shanghainese food is delicious and fresh!  Literally anything you order will probably taste great. The xiao long bao are perfect. We got some lamb satay and cumin skewers; cooked to perfection. Dan Dan noodles were peanuty and just the right texture. The spicy wontons were good, but could have been spicier. We got the deep fried steamed bun with the condensed milk; so soft on the inside and golden crispy on the outside!  Radish pastries were the best I've ever had; soft and delicate, it was like eating a cloud. The star of the lunch was definitely the smoked tea flavored duck. If you get anything from here, YOU MUST GET THE DUCK. It is absolute perfection. Smokey with the tea flavor, the duck is moist and reminiscent of ham."}
{"text":"Not worth it, very bland food, delivery people are rude, not worth your time, much better places around!  This is not a one time visit, I order here every few weeks and has downhill for a while now.  Everything gets to me hot, but that's about the extent of the taste, HOT (as in temp).  No taste, no flavor, tried different dishes, and it just continues.  I'll try elsewhere and try not to go back."}
{"text":"I find this place an authentic ambassador of \"Jia Chang\" or everyday family style Chinese cuisine but they also have a large menu with seafood and the like. Every dish we had was what I believe to be authentic in flavor, ingredients and preparation. I should qualify that statement by saying that my opinion and perspective, and thus my basis for comparison comes not from my ethnicity but my more than 15 years living in China.  Had the spicy won ton soup, pork steamed dumplings, gan bian string beans and Singapore noodles and all were delivered hot and tasty with the right balance of flavor.   Nice friendly efficient staff."}
{"text":"stopped in to Great Taste today to try their soup dumplings, and they were pretty good. not too much 'soup' inside, but still pretty good!  the restaurant was big & clean, and service was great - English was not an issue as I read in other reviews!  will definitely go again when I'm craving soup dumplings."}
