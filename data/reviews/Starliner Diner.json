{"text":"Came her for lunch on a Friday afternoon.
The special of the day ($4.99) was a double cheese burger with a fried egg on top with a side of french fries.
When I got my food I had to ask for a knife and fork due to the size of the burger.
Best lunch deal in town!"}
{"text":"A step back in time; like an old diner. All items are named for Ford vehicles and each item ordered can be customized to your taste. The handmade chips are great. All priced reasonable. A great way to wait for your vehicle to be serviced."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and good food, too bad the help doesn't match up."}
{"text":"It was a very nice surprise to have this at the Sanderson Ford Dealership.  Good thing my service guy mentioned it or I probably wouldn't have known.  I would have just went to sit in the waiting room.  I was starving!

CUTE place, employees were not very friendly.  I ordered thie Fiesta Brekfast Burrito-eggs, cheese, potato and bacon.  The egg, cheese and bacon were basically nonexistent.  HOWEVER, it was very hot!  It did seem to take a little longer to make than you'd find at another place who frequently makes burritos.  I wasn't in a hurry. 

I imagine anyone just going to this diner would be a tad disappointed, but it you have time to pass, it's fine."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Next door getting line-x in my truck. Definitely a step back in time. Like a hidden, 5-n-diner. 
No kids menu, and you prepay for your food. Then seat yourself. Other than those things, food was simple and decent. Would stop in again if in neighborhood."}
{"text":"I actually stepped foot on the property of a Ford dealer.  I have driven by this diner for years and had even had a friend recommend it.  

When I went in I assumed I would be waited on and took a table.  Nothing happened so I went up to where there was a sign saying \"order here\".  Still not sure if that was for take out only or not but I got my order in and pretty soon lunch was brought to me.  I had to wait for iced tea to be brewed.  I'll most likely go again to try something else as the food was pretty good and a good value ordering that day's lunch special."}
{"text":"Amazing,warm,nice people and service with a great food. 
I just love that kind of mom and pop small businesses. 
Do not skip if you traveling through this area."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until my husband needed to drop off his work truck at Sanderson Ford. This little hidden gem is in the parking lot of the service department.

This review is based solely on beverages, customer service and cleanliness. 

So my son and I thought we would just wait in our vehicle for my husband but it was a hot October afternoon. Yep a hot October afternoon.  Too hot to sit outside and wait.   We went inside this cute little diner for something cool to drink.  A Coke for me, my son a chocolate shake.

The lady at the counter was extremely nice and pleasant.  She filled my drink. The cook made the shake. They use Thrifty Ice Cream. How cool is that? 

I can't wait to go back and try the food. They have daily breakfast and lunch specials for $4.99. And when the weather is a little more agreeable they have ramada covered tables outside.

Everything about this experience was pleasant. The diner was clean and reminded me ofmy favorite New Jersey diner."}
