{"text":"Decent flavour, similar to osmows chicken on the rocks but nowhere near as flavourful. Portion size is fair. Food was a bit cold. Good service."}
{"text":"They have great falafel wraps and the onion rings are amazing with their garlic sauce! Restaurant is nice and clean, staff is nice as well"}
{"text":"A relatively new restaurant that is still working out the kinks. I tried the falafel platter, and it was fairly average. Decent amount of food for the money, and the service was good, so four stars it is. I was spending the night at the Holiday Inn Express and was looking for a restaurant to walk to. This place is around the block, next to the Denny's. The shawarma looked much better than my falafel. Will try that next time."}
{"text":"I ordered garlic potatoes and a chicken shawarma 

The garlic potatoes were a little too lemony for my liking

The chicken shawarma hit the spot and was a good size. Would go back for the shawarma"}
{"text":"My wife and were hungry and we wanted to try a new swarma place.  We both were glad we went to this restaurant because customer service was great,  clean restaurant and so was the washroom.  Most importantly the food was amazing we both loved the garlic sauce it taste fresh.  We will definitely be coming back for this restaurant."}
