{"text":"Not much to complain about here. Good food on the east side of Madison with a good beer and drinks menu. I had the bison burger which was fantastic and got the side of cucumber cilantro quinoa. People I was with had skirt steak (again delicious) with garlic mashed potatoes (you guessed it....delicious).   Very nice wait staff and good homey kind of place. If I lived in Madison I would definitely come back to this place as a staple."}
{"text":"Based on the rave reviews, I caught Alchemy on the wrong day. The atmosphere was pleasant, but loud. I wasn't that hungry, and didn't feel like paying $10 for a sandwich. So I ordered the tomato basil soup, which was the special of the day and sounded delicious. The basil was fresh, as were at least part of the tomatoes. But the soup had a thick, almost chunky consistency that made me feel like I was eating a bowlful of marinara sauce. I seriously considered asking for a side of pasta. Instead, I sent my soup back half-uneaten, paid my bill, and left. I don't know if I'll be back, since the menu seemed pricey and I didn't see anything that really piqued my interest."}
{"text":"The Alchemy is a wonderful bar located in a fantastic neighborhood. The food is always fresh and tasty, the staff is extra-ordinarily friendly and the tap beers are always interesting. The choice of taps changes regularly, and they do a stellar job of choosing incredible beers for every palate. Try the sweet potato fries for a unique bar snack and the fish fry is to die for. Cheers to the Alchemy for knowing how to run a first rate, inexpensive and consistently tasty establishment! They are cash only, so leave your plastic at home."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this bar for years.  Its just a short walk from my house.  Here's my overall take:  Pros: -Good burgers made with organic meat -Reasonable prices -nice beer selection (a plus for my husband) -the desserts are FANTASTIC! -Food service till midnight  Cons: -doesn't accept cards (not even debit cards, who's fees are nominal compared to credit cards) -when busy service tends to take a dive -I've tried a few of the other sandwiches (the fried walleye and the BLFT) and they were less than stellar  Overall, If you come in with enough cash and order a burger you'll probably leave happy."}
{"text":"I'm so thankful to have Alchemy in my neighborhood.  Their sweet potato fries are amazing.  A trip to Alchemy wouldn't be complete without them.  They do a great job of sourcing a lot of their products, particularly meat, locally, and their specials often feature seasonal ingredients.  I have yet to find a menu item that I haven't been really, really happy with.  This is always where we bring out of town friends. They have an ever-changing excellent beer selection - lots of unique, hard to find brews - and the servers are usually quite knowledgeable about them.  The place also has a nice vibe.  The only less-than-ideal experience we had is on a Friday night.  We had to wait for quite some time to get a table only to find out that, because of their friday fish fry (though I hear it's great), they don't make sweet potato fries on Friday.  And as I said, a trip to Alchemy isn't complete without the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Great service, food, and local brews. The wasabi green beans, Gorgonzola ranch, and hot wings were fantastic. Cool atmosphere as well"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a hipster hangout, which can be a good or bad thing (depending on who you are).  However, the drinks (old fashioned, especially) and food are phenomenal.  They buy local and step outside the box on dishes...two things both my husband and I appreciate.  Also, the prices are not bad for the size of plates and quality."}
{"text":"wish i could give you ten stars. awesome. amazing. so yummm. one of the best meals i have ever had. sweet poato fries. blt w/ green beans. local. fresh. super great."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. First visit tonight, not something to write home about but not the worst either. First, the atmosphere can be quite loud like you would expect from a bar. It fills up in there so come early or you will be waiting. Wear layers because its quite warm inside. The door offers a blast if cold air every now and then but overall warm. Carry cash or have your ATM card- they do have an ATM in the bar with only 1.00 fee so nothing outrageous. Service was very slow. We asked for a straw with the water, never saw that. Also they do not have steak sauce so inward told I could get their homemade version, didn't see that either. It took quite a while for someone to notice we needed a box and bring the check. The food, only bright spot in my visit. Excellent fish fry & hanger steak.  I am sure I will return at some point but not my go-to spot."}
{"text":"fresh food? NO. Who was cooking Friday Oct 16 early evening 430ish? Sweet potato fries were burned black and gross. Coconut curry was dry and obviously a left-over batch. friend's burger was NOT made to order(medium-rare), instead was dry and burned in areas. Guess we should've sent things back but one always feels bad for the waitress.  Won't be giving this place my money again."}
{"text":"Solid bar food, and by solid I mean heavy and solid food. Amazing rotating beer taps--drink something you like on monday, it will likely be gone forever when you go back on wednesday."}
{"text":"In the last 3 years, this has been our go-to-place for fish fry Fridays. But the last several times I've been, the fish was not up to par. Fryer seems to be in need of cleaning after an hour of work because the fish come out a bit too dark. Also, in my last visit, we received half a portion of the fish fry order compared to a table neighbors who, right as we were leaving, we saw got their fish orders (our plates were literally half the size of theirs, and the amount of fish was also noticeably different ). not cool to charge the same for serving less and for the waitress to have served it that way.  Other than that, the food is ok (depends what you get. For example, cooks put a bit too much liquid smoke into their burgers. Place is noisy and not good for conversations. Staff is pleasant and always moving."}
{"text":"Wasabi green beans!!!!   I basically love everything on the menu here, but the Zaremba Burger is by far my favorite. Grass-fed beef? Yes, please. Bacon? Duh. Green olive and shallot salad and herb gorgonzola dressing? The best thing in the entire world.    This place gets really busy, so be prepared! They have a large bar, which is nice when you're waiting for a table. They also have full service at the bar, so if you can't get a table, feel free to indulge right there!   Another great dish you should try is the BLFT. It's a BLT with a fried tomato.  They could put anything they wanted on the sandwich just so long as it has bacon on it. Any meal that includes bacon is amazing and a must-have. I once saw a shirt that said \"Exercise. Ex...er...cise. Ex...ar...size. Eggs...are...sides. For bacon. Bacon.\"  I feel like this is very accurate. :)"}
{"text":"I was in town for the Wisconsin/BYU game that day with my gf and two other friends, and while we were driving in we had found this place on Yelp. Luckily we got in right before the rush because this place was packed within minutes after we sat down! The beer selection was great, highly recommend the Amber Ale they had on tab, just plain delicious. This was my first time in the area as I'm from NJ, so getting cheese curds was an absolute must. They were great, very lightly fried, bite size pieces that were easy to eat and enjoy. I ended up getting the Turkey burger there, which was just flat out incredible. We had flown in around 8-9am into Chicago and we arrived into Madison around noon, so we were hungry after our travels, and I believe I speak for everyone I was with that day when I say it flat out hit the spot. Great atmosphere too, being that it is in a college town, a lot of energy and the staff was very attentive and polite. If you are in the area, it's a no brainer, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the reviews already posted, I found the food very delicious and everything had a nice twist to items that might have otherwise been boring.  Case in point-the blackberry jam served with sweet potato fries, as well as a nice herby mayo.  The onion rings were also fantastic, I recommend buying those regardless of your meal choice, and definitely with a beer! (served with a great buttermilk dressing sauce and a tangy bbq-type sauce) I had the Apple rum burger which was very good, and chose the wasabi seed green beans which were a nice alternative to potatoes (although I stole some fries from another person's plate and they were great too)  Everyone else enjoyed their meal, and I was definitely eyeing the stuffed grilled cheese and BFLT.  Good prices too for the food and great beer selection (next time i go im going to try the bloody mary, it listed it as made with freshly squeezed juices--none of that mix crap!)  http://www.alchemycafe.net/id2.html"}
{"text":"We get to Alchemy a couple times each month, and it's become a go-to place for us. The food is solid, the service is OK, and the beer selection is terrific.  Here are our favorites: - Friday night fish fry. It's way too much food, but the fish is some of the best in Mad'town. You'll have to wait for a table, but if you time it right, it's soooo worth it. - Beer selection. Always changing, and always good. - Bloody Marys. They make their own vegetable juice...so their BMs are a little \"sweeter\" than others because of the carrot juice, but amazing. - Maize salad. That sucker will fill you up...with goodness - Zaremba burger. I think my GF dreams about this burger at night. That's probably why there's sometimes drool on her pillow - BLT. The aoli is out of sight, and they really toast that homemade bread. - Sweet potato fries can be a little spotty, and they're not available on Friday nights, because the fryer is too busy making your fish.  If you're going for the first time, here's a free parking tip: on evenings and weekends the parking lot PAST Alchemy (to the South/East) is always free with plenty of spaces."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Madison. Great atmosphere, good music most nights of the week. I love the farmer's lunch and daily specials. Great local food options at decent prices. Decent beer selection.   They don't take cards, so make use of the ATM inside."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Madison. Every dish is well thought out, ingredients are fresh. Best dish is their flank steak, only $14, can't beat the flavor and the price. Only downside is they do not accept credit cards, but worth it to have cash on hand."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have a late lunch/early dinner - it's nice and cozy, and still quiet at that time. The sweet potato fries are fantastic, and I can never choose between the stuffed grilled cheese and the matilda.  The beer is reasonably priced, as well. Great vegetarian comfort food!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had a good experience both times.  It has a nice neighborhood cafe/pub kind of ambiance.  There seems to be a wait on Friday and Saturday, but that's pretty typical.  They do have a bar area where you can have a drink.  Nice selection of beers.  I would say that overall the food is good but not amazing.  Service has been good as well."}
{"text":"Alchemy is easily my husband and my go-to place to eat when we can't decide. They have an excellent rotating tap selection and the food is local, delicious and cheap! Whenever possible, try the specials, especially the Batch bread plate of the day! My only complaint is that when they do Friday Fish Fry, they don't offer their amazing sweet potato fries. Also lots of great vegetarian options, which makes me very happy. I recommend the Matilda sandwich, the Maize salad, and my husband recommends the Tin Shack Smokehouse burger. The service is generally good, but sometimes leaves something to be desired. Also expect a wait if you go out after 6pm on weekends and many weekdays."}
{"text":"This place is ok....I mean the reviews seem a bit over the top to say the least. The Alchemy fancies itself as a rival to perhaps The Weary Traveler....it's not. The food is just average and the hippy decor is just plain annoying. They do have a small outdoor patio which helps the cause. Big beer selection so if you envision yourself knowing the ins and outs of \"hand crafted, small batch\" beers then you'll be able to overlook the shortcomings."}
{"text":"Love the comfortable interior and they always have great beer on tap.  I usually order whatever they have on special and am always please.  The soup has always been great."}
{"text":"Great beer lists, best onion rings in town and a menu with something for everyone that features local ingredients."}
{"text":"Just went there for fish with my family. DELICIOUS!!! I also love the stuffed grilled cheese. Would recommend if you're looking for a great local Madison restaurant!"}
{"text":"consistently good food. great house burger. always creative specials. typically an excellent beer list, but recently I've noticed they've been focusing a lot on WI brews which, imo, are average on average. a seat at the bar is my favorite spot. the bartenders are usually pretty cool and fun to chat with and are good for an honest beer recommendation. nice space. no tvs. good music. expect to wait around dinner time, just grab a beer and hang out."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I am...was... the biggest, most loyal Alchemy fan.  Until tonight.  I am basically obsessed with the Tinshack burger, see, and well, I am expecting see, and I have been craving this burger a LOT.  I won't even consider going elsewhere for a burger.  Until tonight!  A few weeks ago when I started craving this I ordered a well-done burger for takeout, doctor's orders, and got home to a medium rare burger :(  (Even though I listened to my husband say it HAD to be well done, I am expecting, and so forth.)  So... I cooked it some more at home.  It was sad.  They gave me half off my next burger.  I had them cut it in half so I could be sure it was well done before I left.  I was happy.  Then tonight I ordered another one and if was medium-rare!  DH said it was even more rare when he got there and he waited while they put it back on for more time.  (What the heck?!)  We had to drive all the way across town to get a new, well-done burger, as we had ordered it!  This is a safety issue, I HAVE to have it well done, and he not only tells them that when he orders, he also, as I said, asks for it to be cut in half so he can check.  So we drove all the way back to the Alchemy, my once favorite place of all time to get a burger and they make me a new one.  It is burnt, and I mean, really burnt.  Char is not good for me or my little one.  I am not much of a cook, but I CAN make a burger well done and not burnt.  !  I am just really sad and disappointed.  I feel this place, again, my favorite place, has no pride, respect, or standards for their customer.  It just takes a little time and a little care to make a burger well done and not burnt.  What they served me in unacceptable- not once,not TWICE, but three times.  I went from biting into rare meat to eating char tonight and it does not make me happy.  I am done, and I was a HUGE fan.  The hugest."}
{"text":"By most measures, I should love Alchemy. The food is very nicely done pub fare and the taps are second to none. The space is cozy with hardwood floors and an elevated bar, and they often feature local music.   However, Alchemy doesn't appear to care about their customers very much. The main reason for this is that they are cash-only. To add insult to injury, they have installed a high-surcharge ATM inside the building. This tells me two things: their business practices may be unethical (I was told all their logs are \"hand-written\") and they care more about customers' money than their happiness. They deflect inquiries about cards by claiming that cash-only \"keeps it local\". No, what it actually means is that they are deliberately not leaving a tax trail. Unless you like carrying large bundles of cash around, this also makes Alchemy a poor choice for groups, which is too bad -- shouldn't they want our business? This is 2015. If you can't afford to take cards (ever hear of Square?), or an alternate payment method than cash, you can't afford to be in business."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out Alchemy for all the vegetarian and vegan options.  Unfortunately, due to some temporary dairy and soy allergies, (I am nursing my newborn that can't have those things come through my milk) I was unable to get what I really wanted from the menu.  This review is less about the food and more about the service.  Felicia (sp?) was the best waitress I have come across in a really long time.  I appreciated her true concern for my allergies.  Most people in the restaurant industry won't take the time to go back and double check things in the kitchen.  More often than not, when I ask questions about ingredients, they say- \"I think it's fine\" or \"I don't think there's blah blah in there\"...  Ummm, how about don't think... KNOW.  Be knowledgable about your menu, and if you can't know everything- go ask.  Please don't make me ask you to go and double check.  I didn't need to ask Felicia,  and it was so refreshing.  The chefs in the back also erred on the side of caution for me.  Thank you so much!! We'll be back when I can eat whatever I want!"}
{"text":"Huge fan. Sweet potato fries are mind blowing! Always enjoy the staff too. The biggest downside is that it's so busy on weekends."}
{"text":"I know I don't speak for everyone, but for my wife and myself I can definitely say that the hamburgers we ate last night were some of the best we have ever eaten.  This was our first time in Madison, went for a concert at the Berrymore, and wanted to get something to eat before, saw this place on the web, liked the menu, and my wife was happy after we left.  I highly suggest it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Alchemy.  Went with my girlfriend and thought it was a great spot for a date but I think it would be great for groups.  We were seated right away on a Saturday night and the service was really good.  Beer selection was good, cocktails were really good, and the wings are incredible.  Loved the cheese on them and they had the right amount of heat.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had been to alchemy once before and the food was pretty good both times. However, my service was so poor the second time that I feel compelled to write a review.     First, please never order their Kalamata martini unless you love drinking extremely salty drinks! I asked my husband to try it just to make sure I was not off base and he totally agreed with me that it was actually undrinkable (like sea water).      I had asked my server about the martini ahead of time and got a very vague and unhelpful description. I then made the mistake of ordering it. When I tried it and politely said to the server, \"I am really sorry but i am not enjoying this drink at all,\" I was interrupted by her and told that because it was such an expensive drink, she would have to charge me and that she could not replace the drink. I accepted this answer even though I was irritated by it.  Then I very calmly asked that in the future, if asked about the drink, she consider emphasizing the salty quality to future customers. I was met with defensiveness and attitude. I did not order another drink during the night and the whole experience did put a negative spin on the evening. I wish this place would understand that it is behaving in a way that is penny wise and pound foolish. Had they responded in a kinder way, I would have bought more drinks that evening and would have returned to the restaurant in the future but now I won't. Seems hardly worth the small cost of replacing the drink to me!"}
{"text":"When my husband and I first arrived in Madison from Berkeley, CA, this was the first restaurant that we ate at in our new neighborhood.  I remember us both sighing with relief as we read over the menu taking in the selection of craft brews and locally sourced eats.  While our fears of not being able to satisfy our pretentious palates in Madison were generally unwarranted, to us, Alchemy remains a stand out in the exciting Madison restaurant scene.        Three factors pulled us to this restaurant when we were deciding where to eat out in the neighborhood (and when should have been making dinner at home): beer, food, and ambiance.    A big wave of excitement would fall over us as we sat down and the table and got our first look at the tap beer list, which is a carefully selected list of great (relatively local) brews that rotates very frequently.  Lots of high gravity beers here served in goblets, which inspired one of my signature phrases when we are out and about, \"I want a big beer in a tiny glass!\"    The food is generally very good with the stand out being the very reasonably priced and delicious hangar steak served with broccoli and mashed potatoes.  The Friday Fish Fry is one of the best in town.  The French Fries are extra delicious making it difficult to choose the healthier side option of sesame green beans although these are also really tasty (best to order both sides and share with your dining companion).  Love the desserts, a varying selection of cakes and pies, produced in house or by Honey Bee Bakery.   The dark wood in this place lends an air of romance making it a great date spot as long as the live music interests both parties."}
{"text":"The Tinshack and Zaremba burger are on my top 5 burgers in town. Maybe even top 3! Wasabi green beans are a must. Best Sweet potato fries in town, you just can't get them on Friday's as they have their fish fry. Always busy so expect a wait but it is worth it. Great rotating beer list and service is always pretty friendly.Free music almost every evening makes it a great destination in the Schenks Corners neighborhood"}
{"text":"Love the beer menu-great descriptions and it changes. Food is always yummo, appears freshly made. Small place, fills up fast, we make a habit of stopping at \"off peak\" times. Sweet potato fries are a must try. There is a \"daily special\" post on Facebook about 5 pm."}
{"text":"Found Alchemy Cafe yesterday on Yelp! and decided to give it a try, since my husband and I are in Madison for the week.  I'm VERY glad we found it!  It looks like a small place from the outside, but it's actually fairly big inside.  It's atmosphere is that of a pub, but it's not dark and overpowering.  We were there for a late lunch so it wasn't very busy, but I can imagine this place would have an interesting mix of people in the evenings.    That being said there was one bartender/server working this shift.  He was friendly and knowledgeable about the beers.  I had the Hairy Eyeball which was a very good choice if you like Fat Tire.  The Hairy Eyeball is very flavorful and finishes nice with just a faint hint of bitter.  My husband had the something Rasputin, which is on a nitrous tap.  Talk about big, bold, and smooth!!  I had the Zaremba burger, with olive relish, gorgonzola, swiss cheese.  I think \"flavorgasm\" would be an appropriate description :)  The one thing that did irk me was the $3.50 upcharge to have the sweet potato fries instead of regular fries or salad.  HOWEVER, when the giant plate of sweet potato wedges were brought out instead of a regular side, all was forgiven.  Oh yea, blackberry jalapeno jam with the sweet potatoes was HEAVENLY!!  Even with that upcharge, for both of our burgers and beers the tab was $25 for two people.  That was a very pleasant surprise :)  I hope to get back to Alchemy later this week sometime, if not I will be back the next time I get to Madison."}
{"text":"The grilled bison burger was the best of any type burger I have tasted in Madison and beyond. The  chip-shaped French fries were also delicious and deep fried in fresh oil. The squash soup was spicy, but not overpoweringly so.  The ambiance is old and rustic- bare brick, wood floors, tables and bar.  My only quibble was the loud rockabilly which echoed almost painfully off the bare brick walls.  They were nicely obliging in turning it down to background level.  No plastic accepted."}
{"text":"Visited alchemy a few times before for a beer but today was my first time eating there. The beer selection is always top notch. Maybe 7 or 8 taps, which isnt a lot, but they rotate often and are always great. I had the Applerum Burger w a side salad and my girlfriend had the stuffed grilled cheese and green beans. The grilled cheese was the better of the two. We also got some sweet potato fries which added to the good meal. Overall the food is above average, but the beer selection and cool atmosphere makes up for it. They also have great music almost every night."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting typical bar food - this is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  Creative dishes with fresh ingredients and well cooked. Good selection of beers on tap, love the neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"I can't even bring myself to describe the Alchemy menu as \"bar food.\"  Yes, it's a bar and yes, they have food...BUT the menu is so much more than burgers and fries. The Farmers Plate with portabella pate is a terrific starter as are the awesome sweet potato fries (none of those faux sweet potato fries, these are the real thing).  They menu changes often, though they always keep stalwart favorites such as the Arboretum Burger.  Definitely try the Wasabi Green Beans for a side!  One of the best things is Alchemy's commitment to local, organic.  Oh, did I mention the beer list AMAZING!  The tap beer is ever-changing and always features some of the best beer available."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Alchemy so went for dinner with two friends on a Friday night. We were told the wait would be about 40 minutes but it ended up being half that which was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the tinshack smokehouse (bison) burger w/ wasabi green beans, chile marinated flank steak, and the night's special which was a whole rainbow trout. (Side note- they do not serve their sweet potato fries on Friday due to Friday Fish Fry which we found out too late). For drinks we got an Earl Grey Moscow Mule and the Hibiscus/Kombucha/Gin drink. All of the mains were really tasty but the sides were nothing special which was disappointing considering the rave reviews the wasabi green beans have gotten. We really enjoyed the burger and the fish especially. The drinks were a completely different story- the Earl Grey Moscow Mule tasted like lime water and the Kombucha cocktail tasted like lemon water. I know they're famous for their beer list but there didn't seem to be a trace of alcohol in either of our cocktails. I would definitely recommend checking out Alchemy for their main dishes but will never be getting a cocktail from there again."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place.  We had the sweet potato fries and they were great and the blackberry jalapeno jam that came with it was amazing.  My hubby had the hanger steak and it was very tender and delicious.  He especially appreciated how easy it was to sub out the potatoes that came with it for a really nice salad.  Very nice side of carrots with that dish as well.  I had the daily special which was a pulled pork sandwich with ham and pickled eggs and it was so good and so big.  I had a salad with it too and really loved the beets and nuts and goat cheese in it.  I would go here again in a heartbeat.  The service was great, and they did a nice job fixing up the restaurant without losing the neat character of all the old wood in the place.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"I had the pasta special with scallops.  It was mediocre at best.   The beer selection was great though."}
{"text":"I tend to overlook Alchemy sometimes, due to it's proximity to my house. That is a huge mistake because it is awesome! Last night, my sister and I sat outside (blissful) and split their specialty mac n' cheese and a salad. We are STILL raving about that mac....omg...so amazing. The salad was good, as usual. Our server was personable, knowledgeable and efficient. I generally have a good experience there with service, however the only reason I knock off one star is due to the fact that a few times, I went in there just for beers and I felt like the server was annoyed with me for not ordering food. In general, I love this place and I'm so glad it exists in the 'hood."}
{"text":"Foods amazing, female waitstaff are kind of seriously assholes.  I get that it's busy, but it's usually like that. If you want to keep the volume manageable by acting like that to the patrons, mission accomplished."}
{"text":"If you can find a better dinner in Madison for 10 bones please let me know. Alchemy is a fantastic gastro pub. Simple, flavorful food paired with an excellent ever changing beer selection. I have been many times and tried nearly everything on the menu. I have never been disappointed. The layout is a bit funky and sometimes you have to wait for 10 minutes but it is well worth it. The staff are efficient, professional beautiful people. I use this as a benchmark to other restaurants in terms of quality and price. If other restaurateurs are wondering why people are not coming or their business is not doing so well go pay Alchemy a visit and see how it is done. A+"}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic taps, and the best sweet potato fries in town.  I probably eat lunch here more often than any other single venue.  Cash only, but there's an ATM inside.  The sweet potato fries are well-executed, and are incredible dipped in the jalapeno and blackberry jam.  I seldom eat there without ordering them, though it's best to share the platter with a friend.  (Note they reserve the fryer for fish on Friday.  No fries for you!)  If I can resist the daily special, I'll order a small maize salad.  (The large is too much with the sweet potato fries.)  The spicy garbanzo beans are a delicious way to deliver protein in a tasty vegetarian entree.  When introducing friends, I also recommend the stuffed grilled cheese (my wife's favorite), which incorporates veggies in with the cheddar and Swiss.  The toasted sourdough holds up well to the filling.  The hanger steak makes for a fantastic dinner.  The wine reduction with rosemary complements the beef well, the gorgonzola providing sharp contrast."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Alchemy!  However, you need to be aware that there are some quirks before you go, and I can only speak for the vegetarian options.  Cons:  - Like other reviewers mention, the temperature is not well controlled.  Every time the door opens, a cold blast sweeps in.  Try to sit away from the door or in the windows.  - The atmosphere is definitely bar style.  I love the low-key feel, but it is not a place to go on an anniversary or a business lunch.    - Parking can be a bit tricky on the weekends.  Generally, it isn't a problem.  - They only take cash.  - The service is hipster-ish and occasionally disinterested.  However, it has never been rude or poor.  Pros:  - The food is inventive and outstanding.  I don't care for green beans or wasabi, but the wasabi green beans are unbe-freakin'-livable.  The fried green tomato sandwich was a fantastic culinary romp.  My dining companion loves their chickpea salad - which is very good.   - The location is great for hanging out in the Willy Street/Atwood area.  There are great bars around it for after dinner drinks.  Overall, go with the right mindset and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Their sweet potato fries and the jalapeno jam... to die for. In all honesty, the sweet potato fries themselves were not that great. But the combination of the two is AWESOME. They are cash only, so come prepared! But if you're not, they have an ATM next to the bar."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience here earlier today. The place was jammed but I found a solo spot at the bar. The girl behind the bar served me a water without me asking and a menu. She told me right off the bat that they were running low on some menu items because they were closing for a few days the next day and they were running down the inventory to avoid spoilage and loss. I appreciate being told that right away before I try to order some thing(s) and then being told that they're out. Anyway, I scored the last Tinshack Smokehouse Burger which was a perfectly cooked medium rare bison burger with all the fixins. Complemented perfectly with a tap of Founders Dissenter...a beer I had been wanting to try! Thanks for being open on Labor Day and thank you for the terrific meal and outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Get the stuffed grilled cheese. Don't even look at anything else. Just get it. One of the best things you'll taste in this city."}
{"text":"So have wanted to try The  Alchemy for a while. Tonite, by chance, we found our way there.  We were early, but were welcomed in by, we assume, the Owner/Manager.  Cocktails were excellent. The bartender was busy, but friendly. And the food...OMG...I tried the special, pan fried Walleye with wild rice with Cherries and Almonds plus grilled asparagus.  What can I say? Excellent blend of flavors and textures.  The Mrs, had the fish fry - cod - with house fries and slaw. Huge portion, well prepared, full of flavor.  The menu here has lots of options that we want to try. We will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious Friday Fish Fry. The French fries are unique and super fresh. The tartar sauce is wonderful and the fish was splendid. Their cherry brandy in the brandy old fashioned is a must do. Have to pay with cash, but that's fine."}
{"text":"Service was great. I loved my Wild Rose drink with kombucha. Food was great. The fish tacos had marinated cucumber which tasted funky, so won't order them again. But the flank stake was delicious."}
{"text":"it says on the menu, cash/check only. yeah no sign on the door, but should there be? had the burger and sat at the bar and drank some fantastic beer on tap. good service on a busy friday nite from tenders. burger was top notch, person next to me had the friday nite special fish fry, heaping plate and he said it was excellent. excellent atmosphere, excellent food and pretty good service on a busy nite."}
{"text":"love it!  My only complaint is that it's a long wait, but part of the reason for that is that it's a small place, which also adds to the charm and character of The Alchemy.  They know how to cook some great food--lots of flavor.  The one thing I didn't like was the fish tacos."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to frequent in Madison.  Everything on the menu is great.  I would recommend the stuffed grilled cheese and the sweet potato fries all with local food.   They also have a great craft beer tap list and the bloody mary is fantastic.  The mix is homemade with a jack lalane juicer.  The only downfall is that it is cash only, but also have an ATM onsite."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal!  So many vegetarian/vegan dishes.  The stuffed grilled cheese is delicious as is the Bison burger.  The tables are apart from bar but you still get the feeling of being in a casual spot.  Service was great!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food, creative spin with local ingredients. Best burger I've had in awhile. Friendly staff. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I like this place. The dining area is incredibly cavernous given that the place just looks like a little storefront bar from outside. The elevated seating areas set the customers slightly apart from the main room and have great views of the busy streets outside. They have a fantastic tap beer selection, and the food was fine. The beer-battered BLT was a fun concept, and my friend thought the buffalo burger was good. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place on Atwood! Nice, casual ambiance and fantastic food!  It's seat yourself and the day we came, there was only one waitperson for the whole place. She was a wonder to watch! Friendly and courteous to each and every guest, timing her appearances at the tables perfectly and never once letting on that she was run off her feet! It helped that the kitchen cranked out wonderful food at a good pace. I got the stuffed grilled cheese sandwich which was utterly delicious! It came with a seasonal salad which had lovely beets and fried parsnips. It was to die for! The table got an order of the renown sweet potato fries which come with a couple of dipping sauces you want to take a bath in.  And the prices are entirely reasonable, a bargain actually when you consider the caliber of the food. We will be back next time we're in Madison!"}
{"text":"I went here on the way through town on the recommendation of a friend.  However, I left quite disappointed.  The service was as poor as I've had in years.  It took quite a long time to get menus and place our order, but it wasn't exceptionally bad.  However, it then took somewhere on the order of an hour to receive our food.  I had planned to stop in for a quick sandwich and get back on the road, and instead I found that our meal took over an hour and a half.  I understand that maybe sometimes a kitchen gets backed up or somebody doesn't show up for the day, but the waitress never communicated with us that there were any problems.  if she had done so, or given me a chance to order something quicker, that would have made my experience much more pleasant.  Perhaps that would have been acceptable if the food were exceptional, but it really wasn't.  I ordered the Walleye Po'Boy, and while it was certainly tasty, it left a fair bit to be desired.  The baguette was, quite simply, a pretty crappy baguette, and that really did a lot to bring down the sandwich.  It was simply too thick, having nothing of the airy interior and crunchy exterior of a good baguette.  I thought the walleye was great, but the jalapeno remoulade left me wondering where the jalapeno was.  All in all, I could have probably left somewhat bordering on happy if it hadn't taken so long to get the sandwich.  I will say, however, that the beer selection was great and reasonably priced, and the service on my beer was perfectly fine."}
{"text":"No CREDIT CARD!! ONLY CASH! Also they dont want to give receipt because they dont have enough receipt!!!! If u ask they will write a new one give u that!  Food was good, environment was noy that cool, more like old place!"}
{"text":"Great food. It \"feels\" nice in there. A place where you can go with your mom for lunch and go out for birthday drinks with friends that night. It gets kind of uncomfortably busy sometimes. But I enjoy the sweet potato fries and their specials are always realllly tasty too."}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries w/ jam = BEST SIDE DISH EVER"}
{"text":"Not in Madison often and just took a stab at a new place. Good beer & good food before theater at the Barrymore.  Had a cram cake appetizers, Veggie Curry and Perch Tacos. Delish!"}
{"text":"We went here for the burgers and based on the reviews, the burgers were supposed to be really good but we were very disappointed. The burgers were very dry and tasteless.   The salad was equally unimpressive despite the description that included beets, blue cheese and unique dressing.  The best part was the cheesecake which they source from the Looking Glass Bakery. Absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great food--good choice of beers. Neat atmosphere. All and all a place you really should stop by if you are in Madison and you are interested in checking out a cool place with great food and good beer. The only downside is that they take cash only (but do have an ATM inside). The other downside is that it can fill up pretty quick inside and also get a bit loud....but then again--consider your location!"}
{"text":"Came in a little after 5 and was seated right away. Sweet potato fries were good and the dipping sauces were interesting, but I think they're best plain. I ordered an Applerum burger. Toppings were really good, not as much meat to bun as I prefer and I felt my medium was more of a medium well. Potato salad was really bland, wouldn't get it again. Tried a bite of the Grilled cheese; was not what Id usually order but was really good for what it was. The meal I ordered was more of a three stars but I feel like there are some really good menu items and I liked the ambiance of the place."}
{"text":"LOVED the decor, atmosphere and food. It was a bit noisy, but that's a fair trade-off for an uncrowded, friendly local joint with superb cooking. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Well now, moving up in the world a bit perhaps, are we? The last two meals there have been pretty stellar and satisfying. It's a rare occurrence in these parts. Service is service, but my expectations aren't too high."}
{"text":"3.8  Alchemy is one of those places that feels good, and so you return, even though some experiences here are better than others.   Alchemy's Bloody may rival Sardine as the best one in town (see photo). They make their own habanero tequila for the Bloody Maria, which is v. spicy and delicious, and they serve it with cheese, sausage, and the usual WI accoutrements, including a beer back.  The beer is great.   Service tends to be better at the bar. This is one of those places that never seems to catch up with its volume, so service can be slow and spotty when the restaurant is overloaded.  The food quality is up and down. The fish sandwiches are usually awesome, as are the sweet potato fries. You must try Alchemy's very own hot sauce and jalapeno jam. Many of the other dishes waver in quality. Their salads are made of uninspiring spring lettuce mix that comes out of a bag--yuck! I think you can often judge a restaurant by its dressings, and the salad dressings, though homemade, need help (as do the salads themselves).   Liz Chapa is a dessert goddess and you can get her desserts here.   Cash only.  Update: Someone from the restaurant wrote me to say, in so many words, that every restaurant in Madison gets their greens out of the bag in winter because greens are hard to procure freshly (and to grow). My point in this case is NOT that the greens come out of a bag; I'm not naive about food & I do understand that greens cannot be grown by restaurants or food distributors in hothouses all winter. My point is that Alchemy's greens are uninspired and look like the spring mix that you can buy at any grocery store. Choose a better mix of greens is my take-home message, if greens are to be on the menu. Sardine is a great example of a Madison restaurant that has found a way to serve inspired salads using ordinary greens. I do appreciate, however, that someone from Alchemy felt compelled to write."}
{"text":"Have been to alchemy many times, and I love it each time. Always a great selection of beers, and the staff is knowledgeable about them. The addition of a strawberry chipotle glaze to the baby back ribs this last time I went was truly awesome. They're also very vegetarian and vegan friendly. Aside for the food and beer, I love the vibe of the place. All are having fun and it was fine for our month-old baby in there"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.   So, the burgers are delicious, great beers on tap, great warm, old-school wood-paneled atmosphere... Yes, and yes. But the impetus behind this five-star review was the chicken tzatziki taco special on December 19. Please, please make these a regular menu item! Ah. Maze. Ing. Especially with a hopquila margarita! So good!!! If you haven't been here, go!"}
{"text":"Much love for Alchemy, our neighborhood standby. All of the food is delicious and unique.  I love their hanger steak and all of the salads. The fish fry is as delectable as everyone says (in my opinion, top in town). My boyfriend and I usually split an order of their AMAZING wings- crazy good cocoa/buffalo/barbecue sauce on those- as well as as the Tinshack burger which is a bison burger with bacon and smoked onions and Muenster cheese... my mouth is watering just thinking of it.  Alchemy defaults to splitting the burger and its accompanying side (usually we get the fries, which are more American fry than French fry, but tasty nonetheless) in the kitchen so it's perfectly portioned when it gets to the table- it's the little things like this that elevate Alchemy from great to fantastic.  Other little things: prices reasonable, portions perfect.  Ingredients are fresh and local and that makes a huge taste difference. Plus the beer list varies wonderfully and frequently- as does the dessert list; we've loved every dessert we've tried, but do not miss their cheesecakes!!!   Minus one star from perfect for two reasons- one, service can be inattentive/not the friendliest, we always hope to get one of our two favorite servers who are gracious and totally on it but when we don't we end up waiting 15-20 minutes for things like the check or refills. Also because some nights we go there and the live music is just overpowering the space.  I'm a total fan of live music but Alchemy is really tiny, and it seems the sound could easily be tweaked on nights with a band so that diners and musicians could coexist. Instead, we end up yelling over music that's supposedly mellow background music (jazz ensembles, bluegrass etc)... then everyone in the place is yelling, and it gets uncomfortably loud.  Regardless, we're regulars, and it's our favorite place to be on the East side."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a whim one Friday night with a small group. The food was ok. I like the mashed potatoes and someone in our party had the grilled cheese. Everything would have been perfect if the band hadn't started playing so loud. It was an empty house, so it would have been nice to socialize at our table with friends and talk. Instead we were yelling over the table at eachother and couldn't really catch up. I could understand if the place had a lot of people, but it was pretty empty."}
{"text":"We were treated by our friends who live in the area. They recommended this place after we decided on getting some burgers.  I ordered the Delux burger with habenero aioli, red onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles. It came with a side, which were fries, orzo salad, potato salad, or a side salad. I went with the couscous. I thought the choice of sides were a welcoming touch, not many places offers sides beyond the standard variation of a potato.  The first remarkable thing about the burger was the crunchy pickles! Yes, I noticed the pickles first because they were unlike any other ordinary pickles I've encountered. The cucumber was not quite as 'fresh' as the Dotty Dumpling Dowry ones, a little sweeter and crunchier. The burger was very juicy, I believe they said the beef is grass fed. It folded nicely between the toffy-colored buns and singed with the aioli. The orzo salad was good, lightly dressed in a balsamic vinaigrette with small chunks of onions and red peppers. It was a bit bland, I think I'll try another one of their many interesting sides next time.  There was a healthy tap beer list of 10 rotating beers, which is surprising for a smaller place like this.  There was a stage near the bay windows for live music on the weekends. I can't wait to come back and try the fish fry and catch a show!"}
{"text":"Their stuffed grilled cheese is awesome. The side of fries are definitely interesting but not consistent. One time it was crunchy, and the other time it was just drenched in oil and felt undercooked. Overall this place is awesome mainly because of the stuff grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this place! Well done-I always get the sweet potato fries which are amazing! Burgers are great too. Haven't had a thing I didn't like there yet."}
{"text":"I'm always a bit annoyed by the hassle of a cash only restaurant. Alchemy is worth the hassle.  Delicious food with fresh takes on old classics.  This one is a keeper."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is good. Best old fashioned in Madison. Best decor. Best burgers. Best everything! The food is so reliably good and they always have unique options to choose from. Once I got a sweet potato/blackberry pate and it was amazing. Another time I just stuck to the curry and it was also amazing. This is my go-to place in Madison hands down!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what the fuss or \"cool factor\" about this place. The food is pretty mediocre (lots of burgers and sandwiches and salads kind of place). Not any kind of impressive drink selection because the typical options you would see at a sit-down restaurant in Madison. It's located in an area that's difficult to get to (little parking and in the middle of a weird traffic triangle). Once inside, it's pretty much a \"meh\" feeling looking around."}
{"text":"I feel right at home when the first thing asked of me upon sitting down at a table is, \"Bloody Mary's?\" On a Sunday morning recovery lunch excursion, our server didn't have to ask us twice. Their Bloodies have the perfect amount of spice and flavor - definitely a fan.  For food, I opted most recently for the BLFT, which OMFG, why have I not been requesting my tomatoes to be fried in a beer batter for every sandwich I've ever eaten? I went with a cous cous salad with pumpkin and walnuts for my side since it was the special for the day. It's all about balance, my friends. My companion hammered through the Tinshack Smokehouse Burger with fries and after taking a bite of the burger, I almost went hobbit on that lunch and devoured both our meals. I think I'm still finding green peppercorn aioli under my nails. Yum. Ew.  Warm ambiance and a casual setting with anything but casual food. The only downside is they only take cash but the fee for the ATM isn't too lucrative. Get at it."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary was NOT good. Bison burger was amazing! Asked for no bun but got one. Not a huge deal but it's the attention to detail. They have KOMBUCHA! Every thing is local and grass fed! Love! Just don't get the Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"Had no idea what to expect was parked close by and walked in shortly after it opened. Greeted by a very energetic waitress which started off my experience on the right foot. First impression loved the set up of tables and bars it has  different areas some elevated a bit, others right in front of Windows very cool for people watching. Had an old fashioneded with a slightly different take mixed with ginger beer  very refreshing. Than ordered wings and since im world reknowed  as a wing expert was excited.  presentation was perfect and they did not disappoint. 7 out of 10. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cool, my burger was basic... The fries were great and so were the Bloodys! The BBQ and ranch was also amazing. Service was kinda iffy though, we were enjoying our drinks after our meal and just relaxing and our server asked if we wanted our bill because she was done with her shift soon. It was kind of awkward and made us feel like we were over staying our welcome."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service and tasty cocktails. There daily specials are always yummy. Almost always my first choice of places to go"}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever visiting this restaurant, and we came in around 4, right in the middle of happy hour. There is an excellent selection of beers and mixed drinks, so I had a sour beer--something that included passion in its name but I can't remember all that well.  Our server was friendly and attentive and our food came out quickly. I had the perch tacos, which had a nice amount of acidity and it was a good portion size. The fish was well-cooked and fresh tasting, so no complaints here. I tried the house boat as well, which was surprisingly moist and tasty (considering that chicken breast tends err on the side of dry).  From start to finish, this was an enjoyable dining experience that I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I was initially very excited to go to Alchemy because it is close to a lot of great bars and restaurants, so I figured it would be among some of my favorite spots. Their service is fine, nothing special, their food is mediocre, and their beer/cocktail menu is limited. They are also cash only, so make sure you get cash in advance. They do have an ATM in cash of a pinch."}
{"text":"Had a great cocktail here called the \"philosophers stone\".    The French fries were out of this world."}
{"text":"Loved it! All the food our table ordered was great. I had the flank steak and it was not only amazing tasting, but was a great deal. They only take cash so be prepared, otherwise there's an ATM with $1 surcharge. The dessert was SO GOOD! We had a blueberry cheesecake that was to die for!"}
{"text":"Alchemy has an excellent beer selection and a fantastically inventive food menu. I appreciate locally sourced everything, and it's all good. These are the best burgers in Madison, and I highly recommend going Deluxe on your burger - the aioli adds a satisfying, sloppy heat.  It's on the expensive side for Madison, but it is worth it.  Minus one star for a disappointing fish fry."}
{"text":"Alchemy was a hit among my roommates and I! We don't live near the Atwood area, but based on the crowds it seems like a neighborhood favorite.   The food definitely matched the bustling atmosphere. I was really a surprised to see the balance between vegan dishes and meat. This is rarity in the Madison restaurant world. We chose this spot based on recommendations from friends that it's gluten friendly, but we were disappointed to find out that they don't offer gluten free bread. My roommates' pulled pork sandwich slightly lacked, because she wasn't able to eat the bread.   That being said, my Zaremba burger (grass fed) was so juicy and delicious. The green peppercorn aioli paired well but was not overpowering.   Overall, I will definitely be going back to alchemy to enjoy good drinks and good vibes in the Atwood neighborhood."}
{"text":"Delicious food, love the $6 tasty cocktails! Always a fun place to take visitors and friends."}
{"text":"I went to Alchemy after a family wedding. I was impressed. If I still lived in Madison, it would certainly be on of my regular haunts.  A live bluegrass band was playing, so the atmosphere was upbeat. We had a large group and the staff was able to put together tables for us.   The beer list was great. The food was even better. I love it when a neighborhood bar takes the effort to elevate their food. We had a wide assortment of appetizers to share, and everything was much better than your average bar fare."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Great (hand-cut) chips! Nice tap beer selection. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The flank steak was amazing. Perfectly done, tons of flavor. Location and ambiance cozy and interesting. Hostess friendly, server not but even that didn't ruin our visit. Must have the old fashioned. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First of all, FYI, they only accept cash or check. However, they have an ATM located in the restaurant that only charges $1 fee.   Secondly, the food was great. I had the ultimate grilled cheese, which came highly recommended. I had higher expectations of the sandwich than what I received, but it was still very good. Each half of the sandwich, had raw onions, broccoli and so much tomatoe melted into the cheese. I had a side salad that was the highlight of my dinner. Walnuts, beets, fancy cheese all mixed with spring salad and a lightly creamy dressing. I would like to order a full size of that salad. My boyfriend had the flank steak with mashed potatoes and the seasonal vegetables (Brussel sprouts), thumbs up, all around on that dinner. We shared a side of the Wasabi green beans, that also came to me recommended. I thought they tasted like very fresh green beans. Only a few bites to me, cleared my nose, like wasabi. I totally will come back to Alchemy, easily! For those with a sweet tooth out there, I also recommend the Winter Old Fashioned and their Brandy Old Fashioned Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Best service ever! We sat at the same table for 5 hours (ate dinner and watched live music) and received our order of water within two minutes! Nice cozy atmosphere and yummy meals too!"}
{"text":"I was pretty darn pleased I actually had my checkbook in my purse today, for the first time since about 2003.  Conicidence?  I think it was more like destiny!    This was a very down-to-earthy, cozy place (that is cash/check only, be prepared).  While I imagine it can be bustling on a Friday or Saturday night, we lucked out on a lazy Sunday afternoon and were able to park at a table, playing a game and sipping beers for a couple hours.  I really liked the layout of the place, lots of warm woodwork and tables on varying levels making it feel like you're tucked off in your own world.  The menu was creative and everything we had was delicious.  I had multiple vegetarian options to choose from and settled on the Matilda sandwich.  The veggies were roasted / grilled perfectly and the dressing was flavorful.  I had the seasonal salad which was also great (although next time I'd request the salad dressing on the side b/c while quite good, it was a little heavy for my taste)   The beer list was diverse and affordable, which probably explains why we stayed so long.  Although our charming yet unobtrusive waitress helped as well.  It felt like a neighborhood place with a more thoughtful menu than you'd expect (and I mean that as a complement!).  This is definitely a place I would go out of my way to visit again!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. About 8 taps, all of which are solid.   Nice low-key atmosphere.  Food is reasonably priced. Sandwiches and entrees between $6-12. Brutus salad is interesting, but overdressed. Mahi-mahi was flavorless but fishy. Fried tomato sandwich without much inspiration, but they weren't cheap on the bacon."}
{"text":"The cheap and good burger bar place.   Gem of the Atwood area. AWESOMO.   I love the beef thingies like burger, steak sandwich etc etc, chicken thingy was good and fish thingy was good. Lol, I'm terrible at names, but hey they change the menu often enough.   Get the sweet potato fries here, awesome dips and HOW do they make it so tasty!?!?! Just a note, the normal fries give the same goodness but are made of normal potatoes. The wasabi peas, ooooohhhhhh good. Seriously, not very spicy but full of flavor. And my newbie today, quinoa salad, WOOOHOOOOO.  My dish tonight was FANTASTIC. I've never had a better steak anywhere. I had the daily special honey and bourbon steak sandwich. Flavors were bursting in my mouth, the steak was so nice and chewy, and it has the cream cheese I love, reminding me of Bob's bad breath. mmmmm mmm mmmmmm. I usually have only half a burger, but I'm proud to say I FINISHED IT ALLLLLL.  Other favorites of mine are stuffed grilled cheese and the regular menu burgers, all done really well!  My man had the pineapple BBQ ribs, the flavor was top notch, but the ribs wasn't fat enough, so it wasn't soft and chewy..  Bring some cash, come on by (if you forget, there's an ATM). Might be crowded, even on weekdays, but its worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"I usually think the Yelp consensus on places is correct, but it was totally wrong here. I had the Applerum Burger Deluxe, and they forgot to put red onions on it. The habenero aioli was also oppressive and clouded out the flavors from the rest of the burger. Worst part, though, was that the medium basically felt like well-done, and there was no juice left. You get medium to avoid blood all over the place but to avoid eating rubber like well-done. Good test of a good burger joint is if they can pull off a medium while retaining some juices. Didn't happen here.  Also: no credit cards, even though it's 2015 and there's virtually no overhead cost to having equipment."}
{"text":"Great good with a great old school decor feeling.  The food is great, staff is friendly, and beer selection is awesome.  The only draw back for some is they only accept cash...not a big deal..Just plan ahead our use the cash machine on-site."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the greatest places to dine in Madison. Although very small, it is worth the wait. The menu isn't very big, but everything they offer is worth trying. I personally like eating dinner here, not so much lunch. The one issue here that always drives me absolutely NUTS is the ATM machine (cash only establishment). Dude, INVEST IN A NEW MACHINE! I have been coming here for years and there is always some handcrafted sign on it that explains why THAT night it isn't working for some arbitrary reason. My favorite is the sign that says it \"works sometimes.\" I would think that this establishment would make a pretty penny, due to it being so damn delicious and neighborly, but for the love of Pete, make an investment. I think its just super irresponsible and annoying.. Other than that one thing they clearly have no interest in fixing, support this local place because it is totally worth it.   *Cash only, don't forget."}
{"text":"ok- the CASH ONLY policy was a bit of a shock, especially since I indulged quite a bit before closing my tab.  They do have an ATM, but it's rather odd that they don't accept credit cards.     That aside, the food and drink selection was great.  I had the flank steak with the chips, which were some of the best 'homemade fries' I have had.   It was a good portion and tasted great.    I also had too Ana Palmers, which are a must in my mind, and I don't really care for mixed drinks.  I only decided to try it after sitting at the bar and watching them make them over and over and over.  Obviously, people are ordering them for a reason.   The alcohol is a bit hidden, but on a hot day or the start to a night, they're a good fix.   I will definitely be back.      It's a great bar with great food."}
{"text":"The food i had was very well prepared. The negative I have is actual menu itself. The offerings seem limited and not as healthy / veggie friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to Alchemy twice recently. Last night I shared the Beef Brisket and the the Daily Seasonal Salad with my partner. The sandwich was absolutely yummy. The meat was cooked in a beer concoction and it was tender and incredibly flavorful. The meat was nicely shredded and the sandwich didn't fall apart when you bit into the bun. The salad was less successful. The wimpy greens just couldn't stand up to the strawberries and Gorgonzola. The greens became mushy a word that should only be used to describe your lover's Valentine card.   We finished off the meal with a delicate Tres Leches cake. It was the epitome of restraint and delicately delicious. Recently we went to Alchemy in the evening just to have dessert. We had an amazing tort and were treated to the sounds of the Oak St Ramblers. How cool to walk for a few minutes, eat a homemade treat and revel of the sound of a truly east side institution. I love my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"You know when you are hosting someone from out of town who is just a little bit better at being a cool hipster than you?  Take them here. You'll look so good at food!  This place is just like your friend - effortlessly cool or at least really cool in a way that appears effortless. It's laid back looking and feeling, but the beard-per-capita game is very strong.  The food is totally good and the beer selection is pretty average for Madison (read: better than most other places)."}
{"text":"Awesome food, always. Just a heads up- if you want Friday fish fry go early, the sell out & they do not serve there sweet potato fries Fri nights (they're awesome). Also get their old fashioned-it's amazing."}
{"text":"I had a situation a while back where I had a build-up finances and I just got fed up with waking up late and making myself hot cereal for my first meal of the day. I resolved myself to run out and find something worth treating myself to and scarfing down for the day's meal (think it was a sunny winter Saturday after 11a.) in a quiet place to unwind from the idiots I was living with at the time.   I ended up running to the Co-op and found nothing I wanted. Then after quite a jog, I wanted to see what Monty's Blue Plate was about, but they seem to have a perpetual line going out the door (man, are they really that good?). So, by now, my blood sugar is taking a dive. I went into Green Owl and wrinkled my nose. Any other time, yes, but I wanted something thick and hearty.  Seeing this place I had doubts. I didn't like the name, and I was afraid it would be deep-fried \"bar food\". I got the weirdest apprehensive vibe from the waitress, but I just studied the menu for a long time. I felt odd paying that much for the Bella Burger (which was cheaper, I think, back in 2012), but I now find the places back in Corktown are way through the roof on prices catering to well-off white hipsters slumming it in Detroit.   When I got it, I was surprised. It tasted good and was filling (along with all the little things that came with it). So, that impressed me. Yeah, good food for that price, definitely.  Can't say too much for the atmosphere. Yeah, it was warm and earthy, which I like,  but a bit forced on the \"pub effect\". The staff there seemed a bit to subdued and wrapped up in their own reserved huddles. Personally, I don't see how folks try to compare it to Weary Traveler. I remember the music kind of sucking there, but this was after 12p., so, who could expect much?   I often wondered if I'd go back and have a night session of drinks there if I re-visit there and am with the right crowd. Can't guarantee if the prices for drinks won't hurt me.  Oh, by the way, beware of the ATM they got situated right smack center of the place (which does look like a sore cybernetic thumb sticking out in this wood grain ambiance). It is from a company in an area that will gouge you silly for fees if you have a debit card."}
{"text":"The perfect spot for late night, quality food. Others have said it - elevated pub fare, great selection of beer/cocktails, and a cozy neighborhood bar atmosphere.  What blew me out of the water was the grilled cheese (the fries were exceptional as well). The waitress recommended adding bacon so of course I did that. I will tell you, since eating more paleo I rarely eat sandwiches, and mostly tear off as much bread as I can. This was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had and I would not be afraid to order this as my \"cheat meal\" every Saturday night. So. Damn. Good."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and so far...my favorite restaurant in Madison.  First time I went we went on a weekend night and it was extremely busy, with a long wait...but worth it. Sat up at the bar while we waited and kinda took in the atmosphere then. It is a pretty dark lit place, but I think it makes it more intimate. The crowd really ranges from children to elders...they bring in everyone. This visit I got one of their burgers and a bottled hard cider.   The second time went in for lunch during the week, it was tremendously less busy than on a weekend night. We ordered the sweet potato appetizer with the jalapeño jam I believe it was. I ordered the BLT and a tallboy PBR and my cousin ordered the stuffed grilled cheese, we gave each other one half of the sandwiches so we could try both! They were fantastic!  Both times service and staff are great!  Always a go to when I'm in town! :)"}
{"text":"Soup and salad were good, but the sourdough bread was prize winning. How often do you hear that? Not often."}
{"text":"7/20/13 My wife and I biked to the Alchemy and enjoyed one of their awesome burgers.  They had Ale Asylum's Triple Nova on tap which we couldn't resist!  We also enjoyed a Rogue's gin & tonic.  We took the lemon and blueberry topped cheese cake to go.  It was really good."}
{"text":"I can't begin to tell you how much I love the alchemy's wings and sweet potato fries.  Thw fries come with a taragon aoli and... wait for it... a jalepeno jam.  They would have 6 stars in my book.... except, they only take cash."}
{"text":"BE SURE TO BRING CASH! I really like eating here, but the lighting is a little too dark though and it's hard to identify the staff. It's a good dating atmosphere, has a bit of a hipster/earthy vibe, and lots of good vegetarian or vegan options that aren't bland. The aioli sauces are amazing I've had people that don't like mayo not know what it was and enjoy it thoroughly. Their fries really satisfy the craving and their burgers are decent. I often order the perch tacos which are also amazing. With all the places that offer fish fry around here you think fish tacos be easier to find but this is one of the places that tops the cake of the few that serve them. My only complaints are the lighting the size of the venue ( which can't be really helped) and the staff not having any semblance of uniform even name tags or something like that would really help since it is often cramped. Really that's all I can find wrong with this venue. Definitely try to get a little earlier in the day when they have their amazing desserts from local bakeries. Actually I do have one more complaint their cocktails are the worst I've had in town, order a beer or a simple drink don't ask for any  of their specialty cocktails or anything fancy; the cocktails come in those tiny whiskey glasses stuffed over the top with ice which isn't enough for a good mixed drink to have flavor."}
{"text":"While it can sometimes be a little bit of a wait on a weekend, the wait staff is quick and the food is worth it. The fries are amazing (try the sweet potato ones with jalepeno jelly and garlic aioli on the side!) and the drinks are great, too. Super-helpful management. They have live music, poetry readings, and all sorts of stuff going on throughout the week. Superior beer selection for a place I don't think of primarily as a bar, and I've always had great help from the waiters choosing a beer to go with my meal. Cash/check only, but they do have an ATM on the premises!"}
{"text":"My first time to the Alchemy, I asked for a burger without bacon or pork - the waitress informed me they don't have beef burgers without pork because they mix the two meats together. While some enjoy this flavor, this recipe piece isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu, or the website, so eat at your own risk. The fries and service were amazing though! :-)"}
{"text":"Alchemy has easily become one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. There are so many delicious choices on the menu, but my all-time favorite is the bison burger. It has bacon and cheddar and some sort of aioli. The seasonal salads are always amazing, and the sweet potato fries with blueberry jalapeno jam are fantastic. Those aren't on the menu right now, but you *can* order ribs with that jam/sauce on it. Their cocktails are good and draught beers are solid. Even if you go early, there *will* be a crowd, so be prepared to grab a drink or chill for a bit before you're seated. It's a small place with huge popularity, but absolutely worth it. Cash only, but ATM inside :)"}
{"text":"So effing good. I've been here a handful of times for various reasons. Once it was along my bike ride and I stopped for some drinks, another time for dinner, and again for a late snack.  Their drink specials are great. I've been lucky to enjoy two different Mule specials and haven't been let down yet.  My most favorite dish is the portobello sandwich. Sometimes these sandwiches can be too wet or mushy or very one note. This is probably the best sandwich I've ever had. I don't think I set it down once after my first bite, I inhaled it, and contemplated getting a second one. The sammy was fresh, flavorful, juicy, and texturally appealing. I absolutely loved everything about it.  The alchemy fries are a must. I don't know what they put on them but it's a delicious blend of seasoning.  If you get there before the dinner rush, you have a chance to see all their food specials before they run out. There's usually a soup, sandwich, appetizer and a few desserts.  Super chill atmosphere that's warm and inviting."}
{"text":"We have eaten here at least 5 times and have always enjoyed ourselves.  Going by reviews we decided to try the Friday Fish Fry.  Very disappointing.  The batter was more like the batter you find on a funnel cake at the fair.  It was puffy and not at all adhered to the fish which was practically nonexistent.  Had a salad it was okay, but not up to what I have had in the past.  Not sure if it was just because it was a busy Friday night or if there is a staff change in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Best restaurant of all time. Bring lots of cash and spend it all on the delicious beer, the mouth-watering food, and tip your server at least 20%, because they are all FANTASTIC! I love their cheesecakes too!"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Madison from L.A., I am seeking cool spots with vegan options. Alchemy had been recommended to me a number of times so a friend and I checked it out on a recent Tuesday. The atmosphere was great and the host and waiter were both friendly and helpful. I loved the layout of the elevated seating levels. It was packed for a Tuesday probably because of the holiday just a few days away.   The spirit menu had some fun options and the gin/ginger beer cocktail I had was delicious and well mixed. As for the fare, it looked like the menu had one salad, one entree, maybe a soup, and four sides for me to choose from. Okay, not outstanding at first. But then I saw that I could substitute any burger with a tofu walnut burger for a vegan version of any of the three burgers. That made me very excited. The waiter assured me that the cook would prepare a delicious applerum burger vegan-style. I opted for housemade Alchemy fries and asked for a side of pickles too. When the food arrived, my friend's regular applerum burger was dripping with scrumptious toppings. Mine on the other hand looked less than appetizing, just a tofu walnut burger on toasted bread (I think sourdough), lettuce and tomato. The cheese, aioli and \"sweet onion rum relish\" had to removed with apparently nothing else interesting to possibly replace them. (The relish contains anchovies apparently.) The walnut burger was one of the better substitute burgers I've had in Madison, BUT there were walnut shells IN the burger...oops! Almost cracked a tooth on those, Alchemy.   The fries were outstanding! I couldn't get enough. And though I had to ask twice for the pickles, they were worth the wait. Made to perfection in-house, they were equally delightful on their own or on my sandwich.  Overall, I don't fault Alchemy for having trouble coming up with interesting things to do with vegan renditions, hence the 4 stars for great atmosphere, yummy drinks, dope fries and pickles, and professional staff. However, it was a disappointment to have zero condiments offered to me for my burger. There must be something in that kitchen to spice it up.   I'll definitely be back. Maybe the curry will be a vegan winner. Otherwise, I'll just eat before I get there."}
{"text":"I do not hesitate to declare Alchemy the best Friday Fish Fry in Madison. I've tried Toby's ... I've had Dexter's ... and Alchemy is my favorite, hands down. You get 4 good size pieces of cod, with a golden, fluffy breading. It comes with green beans or fries, coleslaw and a roll, for about $12.50. Oh and I almost forgot their make their own gourmet tartar sauce here too -- it doesn't come straight from a jar. If fried fish was healthier, I'd eat here every Friday.  I just realized I recently reviewed Alchemy, but after having their fish last week and visiting other restaurants that were supposedly the \"best\" in Madison, I felt I had to come back and review their fish again."}
{"text":"Had blft!  Two die for!  I come here for fries, but everything I have had is AWESOME.   the green beans are awesome.   Thanks to everyone here for another delicious experience"}
{"text":"I love this place! My fiance and I stumbled upon this place by accident when he first moved here to work. We were looking for a place to eat, and we wandered into Alchemy. The food was fantastic. As a pescetarian, we were worried that there wouldn't be many options for me, but I've loved their vegetarian fare. We can come in here and both chow down on hearty fare. No browsing the menu for a long period of time, and finally settling on a lackluster salad here! We also enjoyed the selection of beers on tap they have."}
{"text":"Really, it's a 2.5 but I rounded up.  It's fine, but it's upscale bar food and the hype really raised my expectations.  I have to start with the no credit card thing - I typically avoid those places like the plague - it's the cost of doing business, you should absorb the cost rather than passing on the hassle to your customers.  But, the place is jammed so clearly enough people don't mind.  I was told the beer selection was the best in town - um, no it's not.  It's fine, a really nice selection, but it's not the best in town by far.  I had the Houseboat, chicken sandwich brined and blackened with a habanero basil mayo, really nice.  But the fries were pretty greasy.  My wife had the fish fry, really loved it and opted for the wasabi green beans, good option.  But, really nothing beyond  A-OK for me, and the no credit card thing makes Weary Traveler my standout preference."}
{"text":"There are fancy burgers where you wish you had just ordered a regular fast food burger and there are fancy burgers where you remember why you order fancy burgers in the first place. This place was definitely the latter. I ordered the Deluxe Applerum Burger (medium rare) and was served a deliciously messy meal. The buns - which I think come from Batch - were delicious. The patty was large and juicy. There were wonderful flavors in the burger itself. A nice sweet taste (apple), a creaminess from the aioli, and a good crunch from the veggies (pickles?). This is not a takeout burger because it would definitely not be as fresh when you get home and the bun would probably be soggy from all the delicious sauces and juices.  Aside from the burger, I enjoyed their fries as well as their wasabi green beans. We had a grilled bread appetizer and LOVED the spread. I forget what was in it aside from mushrooms, but it was definitely a great order. We liked the setup of the place and were happy to sit by the window. We had to wait for our table but there is a bar to hang out at - even eat at if you prefer. Prices were pretty fair. They had some drink specials for the day as well - we enjoyed our Moscow Mule. The staff was very nice, and they have a solid hot sauce selection if that's your thing.  Do remember that it's CASH ONLY here."}
{"text":"I love this place, so comfortable and \"real.\"  The hubs and I had the special burger tonight made with Black Earth beef, portobello mushroom, spinach, Swiss cheese and onions carmelized in the Ommegang Glimmerglass beer. Are you kidding me? Who thinks of these combinations? It was SO good!  Paul had their \"chips\" which are their house fries, and I upgraded to the sweet potato fries. I figure I might as well go all the way if I'm going to eat a burger.  My husband loves the rotating beer taps and watches their Facebook page for updates. They go through the specials quickly, so stop in within 24 hours of them posting a special beer if you want to be sure  they have a pint for you.  They also make a great brandy old fashioned and a hopquila margarita with lemongrass ginger kombucha! Again, so creative!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was tasty. My husband describes it as \"above average bar food\" and our impression is that the cooks here enjoy their work. I had the Chile Marinated Flank Steak and it was cooked as I had asked. The quinoa salad was creative, tasty and a great compliment to my husband's meal. The portion size was enough - not too little, not too much."}
{"text":"I visited Alchemy based on the recommendation of a good friend local to Madison. Based on my friend's advice most of our table ordered the skirt steak, and needless to say none of us were disappointed. The steak was perfectly cooked and the variety of beer options on tap made the experience exceptional. What put our time over the top was the fabulous waitress who provided not only great service but also lots of recommendations for things to see and do in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why it's my favorite burger place. Maybe it's because they have the best burgers.  The chips are great too. If they took credit cards they'd get a 5-star...it seems like a little thing but when you're doing a business lunch it's easier.  The waitstaff are very good, the bartenders are friendly and the atmosphere more like a pub than a bar."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic.  Super solid food, great drink selection. A favorite spot for many on the East side of Madison.  Can get crowded.  So you may have to wait for a table or something to open up at the bar.  However, worth the wait.  Or... You can enjoy another area bar while waiting.  One Barrel Brewing is just across the way."}
{"text":"In 2018, how much business do you lose by not excepting credit cards? Is it some form of protest?"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I absolutely love coming here & am never disappointed. I have yet to eat something less than delicious and memorable. My only complaint is that we never have room for dessert. And that I can't choose between menu items ;)   This place is not for you if 1) you are offended by tattoos 2) you like substituting ingredients in every dish instead of trusting the combinations planned 3) you insist on credit cards (as they only take cash, ATM on site though)... For the rest of Madison area though, enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and decent service, but it's 2017. Shoot the lock off your wallet and let your customers pay with a credit card."}
{"text":"On a thrifting and antiquing girls' weekend, we \"Three Amigas\" sifted our way through Madison's underbelly of used and reused treasures, and found ourselves down the block from Alchemy...just when the need arose to replenish our vintage-seeking tummies.   Here's the noshing lowdown:  1. Summer special salad: mixed greens with beets, candies walnuts and goat cheese. One Amiga added brined chicken as the pièce de résistance, while one Amiga kept it simple.   2. Maize salad: mixed greens spicy garbanzo beans and cilantro, lime and chile with red onion. Me Amiga requested brined chicken as well, because treasure hunting requires protein.   Overwhelming murmurs of \"oh this is so good\" seasoned our conversation, as we plotted our afternoon. Our menu choices were fabulous...Alchemy conjured delicious transformations of individual ingredients into culinary deliciousness.   Merlin would approve, as do the Three Amigas."}
{"text":"Three star if you don't care for bar food, four if you do. I tried several items ... The soups are thick, the sandwiches are huge (same with the pasta)... But in the end this is fancy bar food. I have to say the brisket sandwich was really, really good if you loose half the bread!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great messy, juicy burgers, homemade potato fries, strong drinks, and reasonable prices. Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"As in the one photo their sweet potato fries are sweet potato chips. They come with a delicious jam, but the chips are not stellar alone.  They sometimes are overcooked, not very \"meaty\" and some become more done than others.  One visit the oil needed changing, this could be tasted in the fries/chips themselves.  I'll still be back regardless."}
{"text":"Decided to come here based off of a recommendation from a friend. Parking was a breeze. Let me say this; it was a pretty hot day out and be warned that the restaurant doesn't have any AC but they do have ceiling fans. Also let me add that they only accept cash and check only.   I'll go right in, we decided to order the sweet potato fries (house sliced and twice fried sweet potatoes with tarragon mayo and local jalapeño blackberry jam) as an appetizer. This was seasoned wonderfully and sultry. Flavors of sweet and spicy. Crisp and light. For my entree I had the beer braised brisket sandwich with mustard BBQ sauce, homemade pickled egg, Swiss cheese, and snug haver spinach and red onion. The signature drinks of the day were really good.   The sandwich was DELISH with lots of flavor. Also ordered a side of steamed seasoned kale . All in all a hearty, healthy and delectable lunch. The bartender was very knowledgable and really energetic. Definitely would recommend to anyone in Madison and I would go back again. The only reason I'm giving them a 4 is because of the AC and cash only, otherwise this place is easily a 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"A solid 3 stars.  I'm not sure where these 4 & 5 star reviewers are eating--or not eating-- if they think this food is that good.   Alchemy tries to be something it is not.  I totally get what they are trying to do, but its not exactly working.  There are so many ingredients, which I believe are supposed to make the food experimental, but the flavors don't blend or play off of each other.  They work against each other.  For example, the \"stuffed grilled cheese\"- which was basically a raw vegetable sandwich with cheese- had 2 kinds of cheese, which cancelled each other out.  The pesto mayo just confused the situation.  The quinoa salad sounded good in theory, but not in execution.  Tasted like soap.  The over-hyped sweet potato fries were good, but nothing that hasn't been done before.  Of the 3 items, those are the only I would order again.  The 2 dipping choices, while as offbeat as they were striving for, didn't compliment the fries.  In this case, they didn't ruin them either though.  It worked out ok but more by luck than any kind of culinary skill.     Food came out quickly, prices were ok.  I wouldn't be opposed to giving them 1 more try, but its not like I'm in a hurry to come back.    I get that they are trying to be \"Madison\", but if you have to try, maybe you shouldn't.  Edit: I realize this comes across a little harsh, but that's only because of the (somewhat unbelievable) glowing reviews.  The food isn't bad, but with so many better options in Madison (and on this street alone), it just isn't a top pick for food."}
{"text":"Great place! Good food, but if busy it can be very uncomfortable - close quarters. As well, it was cash only the last time I was there, which is fine - I understand why they do it, but in the 2016 C.E., I personally carry cash \"never.\"   If you can get over the 1950s cashier mechanics, it's an awesome place. Great for an afternoon beer."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  It's hard for me to branch out and get something else besides the stuffed grilled cheese sandwich.  Try the Wasabi green beans as a side!"}
{"text":"I have passed by this bar numerous times and would say \"we need to stop here sometime for date night\" to my hubby. Well, we finally did and it did not disappoint!!  This place was PACKED on a Sunday night. We found two seats at the bar and ordered ourselves some drinks. Now if you have ever been to NOLA you know the drinks are cheap and stiff and Alchemy reminded me of the cocktails there. I was good with my one drink. We ordered the sweet potato fries and batch bake house bread for apps. The \"fries\" were more like soft baked sweet potato wedges. Served with an aioli and jalapeño blackberry jam. We LOVED this!! Sweet potatoes are my favorite starchy vegetable and these were prepared so well. The dipping sauces were fabulous. I could have bought a jar of both to take home. For our main course we got the stuffed grilled cheese with their seasonal salad as a side. We decided to split this. The portion was very generous and they really do stuff that grilled cheese. It had broccoli, carrots, tomatoes not your usual run of the mill grilled cheese.  The only thing that's a bummer about this place - CASH ONLY and really small dining area and they always seem to be packed (I guess that's a good thing too)."}
{"text":"I picked up my friend from the airport and she was pretty hungry so we looked for a place close by.  Parking spots close by were full so we parked a little down the street.  Not too far though to walk and it was a beautiful day.  The restaurant was really cool with different chairs and seating, multiple sections were up a couple stairs and you could overlook the place.  Everyone was welcoming.   The food was delicious with non typical menu items.  We both had different grilled cheeses, mine was a normal one and my friends was dressed up with carrots, tomatoes and other items.  Both again were really good along with the sides we chose.  Great experience.  Just as a side not me they do not take credit cards but have an atm and they do not split checks so be prepared for that.  It was not a problem for us but may be for some.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a super price. Had Maise salad and stuffed grilled cheese with cous cous salad side.  Everything was super delicious. Fast service. Friendly environment. Super airbnb host recommendation. Would highly recommend to all. Just bring cash:)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good beer selection. Cash only, but they have an ATM in the dining area. A great spot for large or small groups."}
{"text":"Great burgers and a decent drink list. Nice ambiance too, never had a bad experience here. Cash only though, so that kinda sucks."}
{"text":"What keeps me coming back?  Hmm, perhaps the fresh food? The simple yet delicious specials?  Or maybe the friendly staff and quick service?  Yup, yup, yup. I have nothing but amazing things to say about the Alchemy.  This is not a place for the finicky eaters. I am impressed by the seasonal fare. The veggie of choice on your special is usually the seasonal vegetable.   The fresh food is apparent and is in an incredible value. For $15, I ordered a braised short rib with shiitake Parmesan risotto and mustard glazed Brussels sprouts. I have never so willingly eaten Brussels sprouts in my life.   They serve Honeybee bakery desserts. I had the vanilla raspberry cheesecake. My only complaint?  That I did not get two slices. Parking is doable in the area. They do not have an official lot but I have never had a problem getting a spot within a block of the area. You will probably need a little walk after eating all of their delicious food.   On another visit I ordered a burger with greens. Their seasonal dressing was a tangerine vinaigrette. I found myself eating the greens instead of the burger. Alchemy's motto should be: Getting everyone to eat their veggies.  I will go back. Again and again."}
{"text":"Wow. Went here with family while visiting Madison last week. Hit this place because it was Friday, in Lent, and they have cod! The place is smallish so get there early. It fills up fast. Clean it is. Nice staff. Great menu.  I had the clam chowder as a starter it was very nice. Rich and creamy although a few less potatoes and more clams are my preference. It had a real nice finish with a bit of a peppery kick.  My sister ordered the house fries and we shared them. I was so glad I got more with my entree. They are cooked and seasoned perfectly.  My meal was the fried cod with the aforementioned fries and the house made slaw.  This included four huge pieces of fish. Fantastically flavored. Great batter and light flakey fish. Terrific! The slaw was creamy and gad a bit of spice to it. Really complimented the fish?  Great selection on the fairly priced menu. Full bar too. We had a nice bottle of Chardonnay with our meal. $20. Seriously? Great price there!  Keep it up. We will return! Everyone enjoyed it and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. My fiancé and I always use a special occasion as an excuse to come here, but you really don't need one. First things first, always bring cash or a debit card here because they are cash only. They do provide an ATM inside. The beer list is always fun; they are continually changing their tap lists rotating around local, and sometimes, hard-to-find beers. I love how they source locally (ex. they use Madison Sourdough for their bread on sandwiches) and their eclectic mix of comfort food and healthy options. The burgers are always a great choice. If the special is good, that's what I usually get. Their food is always fresh and tasty. We love the Atwood neighborhood, and always love supporting this local joint."}
{"text":"Alchemy is a modest hole-in-the-wall, located a couple miles east of downtown Madison. They serve American favorites, including wings, burgers, and sandwiches, in a bar-like setting. I had their bison burger with sweet potato fries and I was impressed by the quality of my meal. The fries were like thick potato chips, served with two delicious sauces. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the bun and toppings were fresh.   Their bar list is really distinctive - with unusual varieties (such as New Glarus cherry stout) from various local breweries. Don't miss their desserts: I tried a cherry chocolate pie and pumpkin cheesecake, both of which tasted homemade.   It's true that they don't accept credit cards and that the place is a bit dirty and run down, but I highly recommend Alchemy if you bring an open mind and the right expectations."}
{"text":"3 for 3 on good meals here.  The sweet potato fries are almost too expensive but we've never regretted ordering them.  They have a couple vegan options too."}
{"text":"This place is perfect, if I lived anywhere nearby I'd come all the time. Great alcohol selection, great good, live music, and all really reasonably priced. Beer wise, not only is their selection really extensive but you have the option to get most of the draft beers in smaller sizes to get a wider sample (one of my favorite optios at any bar). The burger was huge and delicious, cooked perfectly. The servers take on a huge number of tables but are super efficient, checking in with you exactly when you need them and not when you don't. Music wise, don't worry that you're going to miss the 10pm start, the band had just started to play at 10 and was at least an hour late. That said, we barely got a table at 10 so you might need to come early to grab at seat at this amazing bar."}
{"text":"This place turned us into future customers...  It was our first time visiting.    We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere of the place, and the unique crafty food and rare beer this place offers.  We went with the stuffed grilled cheese with their homemade fries and the Tinman Bison burger with garlic mashed potatoes.  Also I recommend the wasabi green beans to try.  Both were cooked to perfection!  Flavors were delish and fresh.  We will be stopping back again soon!  A great craft food and drink place in Madison!"}
{"text":"Visited two weeks ago, on the Saturday night after New Years.  Standard 20 minute wait, but quick service at bar, so we were fine passing the time until a table was ready. She had the applerum burger and a great salad.  i went with the Boat House chicken and house fries.  Got some aioli for the fries as well.  Great food, great drink, great atmosphere.  Bring cash."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Alchemy for dinner last Friday after having drinks there a few weeks ago. There was about a 20 minute wait for a table, which I don't mind for a Friday night and by the time we were seated the crowd had thinned out a bit. Our server was with us right away for a drink order but kind of took her time to get back to us for a dinner order. None of us thought too much of it until it took 45 minutes to get our food after ordering. Two of us ordered sandwiches (a BFLT and a grilled cheese) and one of us ordered the Fish Fry so we didn't think it should take that long. When we got our food it was cold and it was a shame because it seemed like it would have tasted good. I will be back for cocktails but not dinner. The service was was just too bad."}
{"text":"I had high hopes, but sadly they weren't met. I am a big believer in judging a place, at least initially, on their burgers. I had a basic bacon cheeseburger with fries. The fries were great. Skin on slices of potato, clearly house made. The burger sounded promising: black earth beef. I ordered medium rare and it came out properly pink, but it was dry. I wonder if the beef was \"too good\" for a burger; not enough fat to make a burger juicy like it should be. The bun was fairly dry as well which didn't help. Last point: no credit cards. Normally I'm down with a no CC place, but this is a sit down dinner location and with the prices (which were perfectly fine for the vibe), you'd be looking at $50 for a date night... that is beyond cash only territory in my opinion. Glad I tried it, but not eager to return."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places in Madison- I've tried many things on the menu & never walked away disappointed! Alchemy uses fresh and local ingredients to create interesting flavor combinations.  The sweet potato fries are a MUST order- they're delicious & perfectly paired with their sauces. Alchemy is great at using the perfect jam or aioli to complement a dish. Some of my other favorite menu items include their ribs, BBQ pulled pork sandwich, wings & house boat sandwich. They also offer a wide selection of drinks. Food & drinks are very reasonably priced.   Alchemy has a great atmosphere. It's small & dark, but feels very homey & comfortable. Alchemy is cash only so be sure to bring cash or your debit card. An ATM is available."}
{"text":"I tend to either have the stuffed grilled cheese, the applerum burger, or their Friday fish fry each time I come (or carryout from) here. My favorite item has to be the stuffed grilled cheese sandwich, which is smothered with fresh veggies and layered in melted cheddar and swiss. Truly think it's the best stuffed grilled cheese in all of Madison.  Alchemy also has a signature jalapeño jam that is so delicious with their sweet potato fry appetizer. A real bonus is that you can purchase a jar of this jam for only 5 bucks. I have like 60.  Definitely my favorite spot to frequent. Although quite small and sometimes crowded I have not once been disappointed with taste, atmosphere, or service. If I could give more than five stars I would."}
{"text":"I love them. Alchemy is a great no frills late night eatery and music venue. They have a wide variety of musical genres where you can catch some free tunes. The food is great too. I rarely stray from their burgers and philosophers stone cocktail. Only complaint is sometimes the service can be super slow, even when they're not all that busy."}
{"text":"I love to frequent the Alchemy. They have a solid beer selection and an interesting menu. Solid stop in the Atwood area.  Also - the interior has an aura of mystique to it at night. Also features rotating artwork which keeps it fresh. I'd give it the thumbs up."}
{"text":"The best food in Madison for the price.  HANDS DOWN.  This fresh and flavorful menu cannot be beaten, and the beer selection is wonderful with an ever-changing variety  that can only be rivaled by a few gastropubs in the area.  It's easy to spend 3 times more on beer than your food, but so so so worth it.  If you haven't eaten here, GO!  I love all of their sides, but my favorite is the house salad.  It is usually boring at most places, but here you almost forget about your dinner while eating it.  AWESOME.  You must try: Sweet Potato Fries:  Thin sliced fries with  jalapeno berry jam and spiced mayo sides (perfectly delicious)  Tarragon Ham Sandwich:  Deliciously sweet, hot, and thick sliced homemade ham with a tarragon mayo  with tomatoes on a baguette (sinful)  TinShack Smokehouse Burger:  I was having a food-gasm while I was eating this, but I recall there being smoked carmelized onions with muenster cheese, some sort of spiced cream sauce, all on top of a perfectly rare bison burger patty.  All of this in between a nice black sesame bun.  Yummy!  I could keep going on all day about this menu, and their daily specials are local, fresh, and amazingly cheap.  Go there now if you haven't already.  The only negative to this place is the difficulty in finding a table.  If you don't come before 6 or 6:30 during the week, good luck fitting in a table of more than 3 or 4.  I haven't even braved it during the weekend supper rush, so take your chances if you will, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price!  Good beer selection ( need a couple more double IPAs)."}
{"text":"Wow! I have to say this is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Don't sleep on their wings! Ridiculously flavorful and spicy. Also they might seem pricey but you could easily split them between four. The sauce tastes like a mix between mole and buffalo sauce and it tastes like spicy heaven. As far as other dishes I have explored most of the sandwich options. Personal favorite is the kimchi Reuben... amazing. Also I love the cucumber quinoa salad as a side mmmmm. Excellent tap list as well and cocktails. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Alchemy has decent food and a great selection of beers.  My review is more about their late-nite role as a live-music venue.  Here is an unfortunately common experience.  Alchemy advertises a band at 10PM.  I show up at 10:30, expecting a little late start.  No band in sight.  Ask about that and am told the band will start \"around 11:00\".  They let the band start to set up around 10:45.  By 11:30, still no band but seems we're closer.  Unfortunately I give up so I cannot report what time exactly the band started.    This is not a band-related issue.  It is a club related issue.  Please, if you are going to have music at 11:45, then don't advertise it for 10PM.  Music takes a secondary at best role for this bar."}
{"text":"This place was great. SO many amazing options on the menu.  I got the coconut curry which was everything I imagined it would be. (However, some of the squash seemed under cooked?) My partner got the portabella sandwich. He loved it at the time but it may have made him a little ill.   I would go again. Good happy-hour and ambiance. Quaint little place."}
{"text":"We were there initially for an event, than decided to stay for dinner. All the staff that was around that evening were helpful and seemed to have good camaraderie - making for a fun, relaxed atmosphere.   We had the flank steak, rare (yum!), and they allowed us to substitute the seasonal veggies for their awesome green beans."}
{"text":"This place has all the hallmarks of a college bar except it's nowhere near a college and no one is of college age. Slow service, grungy space, cash only. This is probably a local bar but the locals can do better."}
{"text":"Had a bison burger with a side of salad. I asked for it medium rare, but I got it well done, which I ended up not minding too much because the bun and the toppings were just right. Well balanced in texture and flavor and perfectly stacked. Salad was a real salad with beets and candied nuts and goat cheese and not just greens, which was kind of nice.  BF had fried perch sandwich. It looked delicious, but he ate it all before I could try it. I could try the fries though. They were nothing like regular fries, but they were delicious!  I think I will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid spot for drinks and burgers.  It's a great atmosphere - warm, bustling.   Great Moscow Mules."}
{"text":"Good drinks. The perch sandwich was bizarre. The bread slices were bigger than my bedroom pillows, and sadly the perch was very under sized. The fish looked like 4 goldfish fillets. Inexcusable plating Mr. Chef!"}
{"text":"I am surprised that a lot of people did not like the decor.  It is a nice, dark, wood-based bar and I am always a fan of that.    I didn't have the soup, but one of the people that I was with knows the woman who makes them and he said they are very good.  I had the stuffed grilled cheese which I have to say didn't do much for me.  The filling was delicious, but the bread was cut so thickly that I felt like I had eaten an entire loaf by the end of the meal.  One of my friends had a burger, the other the hangar steak, and they both raved over them.  The garlic mashed potatoes were very good.  This is a lovely place to just hang out and have a beer and sandwich."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. In fact, I've never had a meal here that was just OK. The food is consistently delicious, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is comfortable. If you go, consider getting the wasabi green beans. They are awesome."}
{"text":"The house old fashion ed's ROCK! I always tell all my friends to go here for the Friday fish fry. Awesome drink selection, dark and trendy atmosphere, great location, and live music some nights."}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews about Alchemy's stuffed grilled cheese and BLFT I had to come try them both for myself.  On the first occasion I came in and ordered the stuffed grilled cheese with a side salad. The side salad with beets and walnuts was amazing. However, the stuffed grilled cheese had a bunch of carrots and onions inside which was not tasty to me and I looooooove grilled cheeses! I wish it had a majority of broccoli in it like it says it has rather than so many carrots in it.   On my second trip here I ordered the BLFT and was also disappointed on the rave. The fried tomato tasted super oily and did not compliment the sandwich like I thought it would. Instead it made it much more of a mess to eat and try to keep all the pieces together.   Their desserts sound amazing, but both times they were out. Their mixed drinks are very reasonably priced and all sound so delicious. The service was great both times that I sat at the bar to eat. If I do return, it will be to try their mixed drinks.   Cash only, plus their ATM only charges $1 fee! First time I've seen the fee so low."}
{"text":"AWESOME. Seriously. Great food, attentive service, fun location.   It is always pretty busy, especially between 7 and 8 on Thursdays and Fridays. If you want the daily specials, arrive a little early because they often run out by later in the night. THEY DO NOT TAKE CARDS OF ANY TYPE, ONLY CASH. There is an ATM right in the middle of the restaurant in case you need it, but just bring cash to simplify things.   The food: Clam chowder - tons of clam and super tasty Maize salad - huge, just the right amount of dressing, and a little spicy Fish fry - 4 large pieces of battered fish with fries Apple rum burger - flavorful and juicy Sweet potato fries - pretty good, although a little unevenly cooked  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"stuffed grilled cheese is one of the best choices for my vegetarian family. tomato basil soup was excellent. don't forget to top it all off with a Bloody Mary. just don't drive after drinking it!"}
{"text":"Alchemy was suggested by my daughter who lives locally and has enjoyed this restaurant. Except for a pretty loud atmosphere (bar is adjacent to eating area), this place is as close to wonderfulness as a place could get. Staff are great! Amanda explained dishes to us and service was quick and helpful. We enjoyed Canyon Rd Chardonnay, appetizers of a zingy clam chowder ( after all it was Friday Fish Fry night in the midwest!!), house fries, the fish fry meal of cod and I myself devoured a cucumber/cilantro/quinoa salad plus the roasted butternut squash coconut curry, which is so delicious. I have always said to my friends, Los Angeles has nothing on Madison for food, style, or fun things to do. Alchemy could plunk down in any city and please everyone. They accept personal checks and cash- and there is an ATM right there to save you if you realize while choing down you used your last cash moolah to pay for your organic baby diaper carrier, parking, or the Badger Bus from Milwaukee. Believe me- it was a seating challenge but the table with bench was perfect: we had a baby, 4 adults and it was Friday at 5:00... This place is crazy good!!!"}
{"text":"It took me 3 years before I found Alchemy. In the past 7 months, I've been there at least 15 times.  Great beer selection, friendly service, and CASH ONLY (note the caps for emphasis). I learned pretty quickly.  But, most importantly--the food! All local, all delicious. However, there's one standout: the sweet potato fries. YOU MUST ORDER THEM. Seriously. Even if you're somehow deathly allergic to sweet potatoes, they're worth a brush-up with death.  Yeah, that good. Alchemy rules."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! Great food, great drinks, great music, you can't go wrong!  I particularly enjoy their sour nights for a chance to try some hard to find sours!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Alchemy I hope to get something new, because all the food looks so good, but I like the sweet potato fries and corn salad so much I always stick to those. If you like sweet potato in any form, the sweet potato fries here are on point. These are some of the best sweet potato fries in town; they're crispy, well-seasoned, and come with a spicy jam that makes my mouth so happy. The corn salad has a tangy, super unique tasting dressing that I love. It's large enough for a full dinner and has tons of protein for vegetarians or those avoiding meat.  Overall, Alchemy is a great place for a quick dinner, especially with a few people. There are usually at least a few tables free and I never wait more than a few minutes even with a slightly larger group. The food is varied enough for a picky group and everything is pretty good (sandwiches, burgers, salads, larger entrees). The beer menu is pretty sizable and desserts are delicious. They have music a few nights a month too in the evening, which makes it a fun evening hangout.   The only thing I don't love is the space and layout. Some of the tables are pretty close to one another and, for some reason, the space always feels kind of loud and a little difficult to hear people."}
{"text":"This restaurant/pub is a quaint local neighborhood joint. I think they decided on the name Alchemy because the magic that's performed in the kitchen! My wife and I happened on it by mistake. Thank Goodness we did!   I decided to try the Pad Thai (1st day on menu), I'm soooo very glad I did, AMAZING! This Pad Thai could give any street vendor in Thailand a run for their money. The best I've ever had in the states!   My wife ordered the grilled cheese sandwich, it was an amazing flavorful concoction, she also ordered the side of cucumber quinoa salad, Fantastic also! The staff and servers where attentive and Amazingly sweet!  The kitchen alchemists who conjured this Pad Thai dish deserve 10 stars and a page in the big book of Happiness! That's exactly what this Pad Thai did, made me very very happy!!   Congratulations to the chef for concocting this wonderful dish! Splendid!"}
{"text":"Really solid food with big portions, nice ambience, and friendly service. Also cash only, but they do have an atm onsite.  I had the beer braised brisket with fries and my wife had the smoke house burger with the seasonal salad.    The brisket sandwich was excellent. The brisket was nice and tender and really heaped on the sandwich. Initially I was worried the mustard bbq sauce was going to dominate all the other flavors in the sandwich, but it was actually really well balanced. The house picked eggs were not a particular strong flavor however. Not bad, but not an amazing addition either. Lastly, this sandwich was messy. With the generous portions that wasn't surprising, but ask for some extra napkins, or don't wear your favorite shirt.  The house cut fries were a good addition as a side. Nice crispness, but I threw some extra salt on them.  The tastes I had of my wife's burger and salad was also excellent. She has been talking been talking about how great it was for the last half hour. The smoked and caramelized onions were really the star here. Great smokey flavor!  The side salad was also great, especially the blueberry dressing. Again, the portions quelled my worry about the price.  The ambience was nice, with a not overly pretentious gastro pub vibe. There was also a box with some boardgames that were call my name.  Service was also really good. The waitress was really friendly, brought the food out quickly and kept our drinks full, even with a big lunch crowd.  Overall, I am really excited to come back and try some of the other really tempting choices (the boat house and the perch tacos especially) as well some delicious looking cocktails."}
{"text":"I had a very nice lunch at Alchemy. I had the fried perch sandwich and it was delicious. My one complaint is that I might have preferred a thinner slice of bread because it was a bit overpowering. Overall the balance of the flavors of the sandwich was nice and I would definitely order it again.  My mom went with the stuffed grilled cheese and Alchemy fries, both of which she really enjoyed! I got a chance to try the fries, which were crispy yet still soft and absolutely amazing!  The star of my meal at Alchemy was the daily soup special, a coconut, beet and ginger puree. The waitress let us a sample the soup before ordering it, which I really appreciated. Upon my first bite I was so in love that I ordered a bowl on the spot and proceeded to finish the whole thing. It was amazing!  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and food at Alchemy and will definitely return to experience their outdoor seating this summer."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! It is open every day from 11:30 to bar time, the food is fantastic and the wait staff is super friendly!  Beer selections frequently change-which is a plus.  My family loves the place--we have been here multiple times since we first came here after the UW Spring Game in 2013.    I highly recommend the grilled Batch Bakehouse specials, and the Tin Shack Chicken Sandwich.  Alchemy fries are a great side as well. Don't get me wrong-they also have great salads and some vegetarian friendly options too.   Only drawback is  you have to remember to bring cash (though there is an ATM next to the bar-not sure what the fees are)."}
{"text":"So my sister and I were traveling through Madison and we starving.  We found Alchemy, and I figured it was a type of place we'd both maybe like - we did ...  Overall Pros ...  unpretentious place, good food, reasonable prices, nice menu, reasonable beer prices.  Overall Cons ...  Didn't see any signage about the lack of credit card acceptance.  It's OK that they are a cash place, but make it obvious on the menus.  Yes, that cash dispensing machine is there, but what if you only have a credit card and you don't ever use it for cash and don't know your pass code, of even if you have a pass code?  Service was good, but we were not asked if we wanted a second round of drinks (we did) and we were not offered more water (which I needed).  Also the waitress we had was attentive but since we were outside and she was attending to patrons both inside and out, we waited a rather long time for her to come and accept our payment - I finally walked inside and tried to pay by credit card and learned it was cash only.    So my sister had the basmati rice with vegetable curry $10, and she loved it - especially the yogurt sauce.  Washed it down with a pale ale from Longmont, CO and it was only $4 - which was a nice surprise.  In the Chicago area we'd pay $6 for the same glasses of beer on tap.   I had the hanger steak on fries with zucchini and blue cheese.  The portions were just right I thought, and the steak was prepared well, but the fries were not fries about $14.  They were disc-like in shape, over cooked by a lot, hard, greasy, no flavor and very disappointing. I had a non alcoholic beer and at $3.50 it was perfect for me.     I would return if I come back to Madison. There are other restaurants in the vacinity I'd like to try too, but I would come back to Alchemy first - with cash next time, and I would bypass the 'fries'. ."}
{"text":"Alchemy is a great little gem in the Atwood neighborhood. They have a really great selection of beers that changes all the time, and I would argue one of the best Friday Fish Fries in Madison. The menu is casual, but everything is really delicious. The bison burger never disappoints, the sweet potato fries are killer (raspberry jalapeno jam dip is freaking amazing), the chicken wings are ENORMOUS, and the wasabi green beans are a kickass side.  Don't accept credit cards, so bring cash. Waitstaff are always great and super attentive, but it gets busy and fills up fast, so get there early or be prepared to have a drink at the bar while you wait."}
{"text":"Meh. Overrated place due to cool location. I ordered the Vietnamese rice noodle salad, one of my favorite dishes of all time, and it was a huge disappointment here. We had to wait a very long time for the food to come out, and I found this place to be very loud- more like a bar atmosphere than somewhere to go for dinner. This place would be ok if you were just going for music and drinks, but I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Alchemy is one of my very, very favorite dining/imbibing establishments anywhere.  Everything here is somewhere on the spectrum of excellent to amazing.  The staples on the daily menu are fantastic - their burgers are some of Madison's very best, and the specials, oh, the specials!  You have to go early because people are onto this place and they sell out fast.  It's worth the effort to get there, and it's worth the wait, even if it's crowded (it often is).  Bring cash or your ATM card.  The beer list rivals the food menu, with often-rotating beers including some that aren't seen often.  It's definitely one of the best tap lineups in town, and this is a beer town.    Alchemy is a very casual, unassuming tavern that doesn't necessarily tip you off to what awaits you when you order, and that's part of what makes it such a cool place.    This is a somewhat short review but that shouldn't imply there's not a lot to say about Alchemy, because I could go on and on.  You'll be glad you don't have a lot to read because you'll get there sooner!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite lunch or dinner spot on a dime. If you are looking for delish, local food for a reasonable price, this is the spot. They make everything in house. They are a cash or check-only spot, but they do have an ATM. I recommend the BLFT with quinoa. Who doesn't love a beer-battered fried tomatoes?? And they use cilantro in their quinoa...so good! The coconut curry is also fantastic. But so is everything on the menu. The service and atmosphere is wonderful as well. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"The Alchemy seems misplaced in the Atwood area.  Most restaurants and bars in the area are delightfully quirky in decor....the Alchemy had the kind of forced, faux-pub atmosphere that you might find in Middleton or a sports bar/brew pub on the south side.  Don't get me wrong: It's not *bad*.  It's just...odd.  Weird placement/decor/atmosphere aside, I'm okay with this bar.  I would happily return to eat some of the seriously delicious-looking food.  As it was, we were only there for drinks.  The beer selection had some very different choices, which was refreshing.  I was impressed that the wine list had a variety of good wines at $5.75/glass or $20/bottle.  The waitress was *adorable* and so, so nice.  It was a nice place to kick back for drinks after dinner."}
{"text":"Awesomeness! Food=great! Try them sweet-tater fries!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! All the food was great. I had the stuffed grilled cheese and it was 10/10 stars. AMAZING"}
{"text":"I give this five stars for a Sunday night, but four stars on a weekend night.  Here is what's up.  It was 9 pm on Sunday night, having just dropped off my last Uber passenger I needed a decent meal.  Stopped at Tex Tubb's and they were closing, so across the street I ventured to a place that was always too crowded to even approach on Friday or Saturday night - The Alchemy.  And on a Sunday night, after a long day, it truly was a slice of heaven.  The bartender...quick and nice.  The waitress who was not even serving me, very nice and quick (food and drinks were picked up immediately when ready).  My food was out in a matter of minutes.  I love good service.  And there were people at the bar, people the bartender knew and to whom he chatted, but that never took away from my service.  I ordered the fish tacos and they were delicious; just a great combination of flavor that I really enjoyed.    The beer menu was fantastic and the two beers I chose were outstanding.  I would go back just for the beer menu alone.  On a Sunday night, with the prospect of my regular job hassles beginning in 9 hours, a place with high quality food, high quality drink, great service and a relaxed atmosphere was just what I needed.  As Arnold said (again and again)...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Update: some one sent me a negative \"compliment\" on Yelp! calling me some really fun names and saying the \"no cards\" policy is at the top of the menu. It may be there NOW, but it wasn't when we were there. You know how I know that? Because when I complained to the waitress about the cash-only policy not being on the door, where it SHOULD be posted, she would have told me it was on the menu. She didn't.  Also, I'm a very careful reader (I'm an auditor by trade)- I would have seen it, and so would my coworker. So nice try, but no. Besides, the larger point still stands: not accepting cards, in 2014, where more consumer transactions are by credit or debit card (42%) than by cash (40%) (stats as of 2012, I'm sure the gap is much wider now), is just friggin' STUPID, and it  inconveniences customers. Why would you do that??? Oh yeah-- you'd do it to keep from documenting all your transactions to avoid paying taxes. Or at least some people would. I'm sure these fine folks would never engage in such unseemly activity.  -------------------------------------  I was sitting here writing a 5-star review for this place while I waited for the check. I had three really good paragraphs on how good the food was. And then everything changed.   \"Sorry, we're cash and check only. We don't accept cards.\"  I cannot begin to properly articulate the absurdity of this. Seriously??? In 20 frickin' 14, when lots of people don't carry currency, much less check books, you don't accept cards? Really???  And to make it worse, THERE'S NO SIGN AT THE ENTRANCE warning patrons of this ridiculous policy. So you are done eating and in their debt before you realize that you're boned.    Anyway, the waitress says there's an ATM on premise, but it only works sometimes. Yeah, well, it didn't work for me or my coworker.   So next we were directed to a bank down the street with an ATM. Luckily, some other diners told us about a much closer place across the street with an ATM.  So after being embarrassed in front of all the folks sitting around us and walking across the street to withdraw money (and paying a fee to do so), I was finally free of this awful place.   Good food or not, I'd never go back because they don't have the courtesy to forewarn people about their nonsensical payment terms. Unreal.  Also, if our server is reading this, you got a minuscule tip because I deducted the $3 in ATM fees I lost over this episode, plus $1 for the embarrassment and $1 for having to walk to an ATM. I know you didn't make the no cards policy, so it's not technically your fault, but you were sort of unsympathetic (my coworker said uppity) about it, and perhaps this will cause you to encourage your bosses to reconsider this foolishness."}
{"text":"I would have given five stars, but they don't accept Credit Cards - Cash and Check only.  Service at the bar was ok, he seemed a bit annoyed we didn't know straight away what we wanted and slid the beer menu towards us. Once we ordered our drinks he did smile and thank us. Saved by the smile.  There was a wait, but the restaurant was dark enough so we didn't feel like we were on a stage waiting on display. They cleared tables quickly patrons didn't seem to linger too long, perhaps because you couldn't really run up a tab here due to cash and check only. (maybe it is a good thing)  The server we had was timely, pleasant and patient. She even settled a table bet about the type of ketchup that was in the generic refillable bottle - it was Heinz! A+ in my book. However, the fries were so good, that I didn't need the ketchup.  Nachos were delicious and spicy.  My salmon BLT was tasty and FILLING. (see picture). Salmon was a big piece in delicious multigrain bread and the bacon, well, it was just perfect. Something about the midwest and their bacon. THEY DO BACON RIGHT!!!  Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their meals as well and of course the beer. Nice selection of local craft beer!  Waitress seemed to be right there whenever we thought to look for her. Cashed us out promptly and with a smile.  If/When I return to Madison, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Two things: when you come here, bring cash. And come hungry.  If they didn't only take cash, they'd have 5 stars from me. But as it stands, the food and drinks make it well worth the effort to find on-street parking in this trendy and slightly-annoying-to-drive-in neighborhood (yeah, I'm a snob about private lots--nobody's perfect!).  Order the fresh-blended Bloody Mary with a bison burger. They've also got some INCREDIBLE vegetarian choices.   This is by far my favorite restaurant in the Atwood area (and there are a few that are runners-up to each other, but none that compare to Alchemy). Stop in after an evening class at the Midwest Clay Project or Ford's Gym.  :)"}
{"text":"Hung out at the Alchemy last night with friends. Food is flavorful with a small variety of most protein options done one or two different ways. Sweet potato fries were amazing and the bluegill tacos and 'houseboat' their chicken sandwich that has plenty of char and a jalapeño aioli. Tap beer menu consists of about a dozen brews ranging from Pilsner to double IPAs, all Midwest craft brews.  Fun, sit-down atmosphere and bar space, in a fun neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love spending the evening here with good friends and good beer. It is lively but laid back and the food is delicious. Get the Matilda. It's sooo good. The first time I went to Alchemy, I got the salmon and immediately experienced order regret after I tasted the Matilda. The side veggies and salads are always really good as well. The bison burger is similarly on point. It's a good time, as long as you're willing to get a drink an wait at the bar if its a weekend night."}
{"text":"What happened?  This place went from being one of our favorite places to eat and everything was great and in the past 2 weeks everything appears to have tanked.  Same menu, not the same food. Very sad, hope they can fix whatever poor decision led them astray.  Update to the review above, I'm not yet changing my rating or my comments but will say that the kitchen manager from the Alchemy replied asking for clarification which is a good sign and I wish them the best and hope to be able to change my rating above.  If I had written the review 3 months to a year ago would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"For a bar, this place has some seriously good eats.    I agree with Heather, though, when she said that it's vibe is....different. It wasn't bad at all, just...odd. With such a great menu, I guess I expected a different decor than...well, it's hard to describe.   I ordered the BLT with beer battered tomatoes, which was very good. The garlic mayo was a little bit too garlicky for me...on a BLT, anyway. I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, which came with tarragon mayo and a blackberry preserve sauce--which was so fabulous. The chips were really excellent, and I could have made a meal of just those.   Being the nosy person I am, I watched the waiter take several other dishes to customers. The onion rings looked awesome, and next time I'm DEFINITELY getting a stuffed grilled cheese!  Go for the food, even if you're a bit thrown off by the setting!"}
{"text":"I would be perfectly happy if I could eat nothing but soup, salad, and fries from the Alchemy for the rest of my life (which is convenient, as I work right next door.) Their pork belly chowder is truly a revelation!"}
{"text":"Alchemy never disappoints.  From a ever changing beer menu to their very solid menu (heavy on the sandwiches), Alchemy fires on all cylinders.  Be forewarned...it is not a huge place so it fills up quickly and they don't accept credit cards (but there is an ATM onsite). Last Saturday, I started off with the sweet potato fries.  Homemade and twice fried, they were absolutely delicious.  It is accompanied by two different sauces for your dipping pleasure-one a tarragon mayo, the other a jalapeno-blackberry jam.  On their own or together, they rock. My entree was the Tinhouse Smokeshack Burger,  A bison burger topped with smoke and carmelized onions, green peppercorn bacon, greens and muenster, the burger was ever better than the description.  I have been there too many times to count and the consistency shines through.  Be also to try their homemade desserts as well as their daily soup and entree specials. One of my go-to places...you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The best sweet potato fries I've ever had! They were served with a blackberry jalapeño jam that was amazing! The grilled cheese was fantastic dipped on the blackberry jalapeño jam! A definite stop anytime I'm in Maddison!"}
{"text":"The Alchemy was highly recommended from Madison locals, and now I know why. Maize salad ="}
{"text":"Alchemy is definitely A-OK but nothing better.   First, there's always a long wait for a table so don't try to get in on a weekend evening without planning on hanging out at the (small) bar for awhile and grabbing a cocktail or beer.   Second, the food is good but not spectacular... except for the pate special! Whatever kind of crack they put into it, it's always amazing and the bread is perfectly toasted and delish.   Third, the ambiance is pretty good overall, and they often have live music on the weekend, which makes it a good place to go on a date or with a group.   So, really, Alchemy is a place to get food that sometimes is tasty. Overall, MEH."}
{"text":"Upping my review after a great experience.  I had a cajun chicken sandwich that was wonderful.  The alchemy fries are always a treat as well.  The service was perfect.  I also appreciate their unique beer selection.  I will say it really rubbed my dining partner the wrong way that they don't take cards.  I was planning to use cash anyway so nbd to me but it's just not ok for a restaurant not to accept plastic these days."}
{"text":"I dined her on a wednesday night, the place was moderately busy.  We had excellent service and there was great music playing overhead!!!  I noticed on the wall there are shelves with board games and thought that was fantastic!!!   The food was good, typical gastro pub food.  I had a burger and sweet potato fries, however, my friend had some squash risotto which was AMAZING!!!  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Unique selection, awesome atmosphere, and very reasonable prices! Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Some seriously, seriously good food. The first thing I ever tried was the BLFT - bacon, lettuce, FRIED TOMATO. I bow down to the genius who decided to put their next-level batter to use on a tomato. Chewy bread, crispy thick bacon, and veggies that don't taste like water. My mouth is watering just typing this.   I also recommend the Stuffed Grilled Cheese. Served on the same chewy bakery sourdough with pesto, two cheeses, and a boatload of veggies in the middle. Salivating again. Why am I not closing my computer and heading there right now?   Don't sleep on the Alchemy fries - they're thinner than wedge fries but thicker than potato chips. I've heard great things about the sweet potato fries as well but I'm often at Alchemy on Fridays and they ditch the sweet potatoes to make room for fish fry.   The only things holding it back from being five stars for me is that it's often too crowded with no good place to wait (you either have to hover awkwardly by the door or stand way too close to someone along the bar) and it's often so loud it's a struggle to carry on a conversation without shouting. The food is so fantastic, though, that I'll wait and shout. Happily."}
{"text":"Great food (unique burgers, good veggie dishes, great salads), great local beers, pretty good deserts too"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to order some fries and a burger. The burgers and fries have an awesome taste that isn't like any other restaurant. The other things on the menu I wasn't impressed on but the burgers and fries are just fabulous. Service is good and has a nice variety of drinks at the bar. Just a good place to have burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I'd actually give Alchemy a 3.5 with a nod to sourcing locally. I always find the service to between so so and OK. The quality of the food is great, but the portion size can be pretty modest on some of the menu items for the price.   I had the Bison Bacon Burger today. I'm a big fan of bison. I ordered rare and it came out a solid medium. This is a hazard of almost every Madison kitchen - over cooking burgers. This is especially important with bison. The patty could also have been more aggressively seasoned. At $10.50 with a choice of sides, it's a top end burger, given that the Alchemy is right across the street from Player's, which is perhaps the best burger joint in town (albeit no bison at Player's).   I'm sure I'll be back - I'm interested I trying the fried green tomato BLT."}
{"text":"The best homemade \"fries\". They are thin cut but wide. Extremely well seasoned. Not soggy. Still have some of the potato skins on them. Generous portions but not gluttonous. So delicious, I could eat these all the time and I'm not the biggest fries person.  The rest of the food here is usually pretty good. Creative dishes, not pretentious environment, someone is paying attention in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison and came across this place. Very \"Hipster\" place...they don't even take Credit Cards! Food was good, service was very good, and tap lost was unique. Had the special of the day which were Flank Steak tacos. 3.5/5. You don't go there for the food specifically but more for the vibe of it all."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and light beer drinker and go to Alchemy only because a group of my friends do. Alchemy is to be commended for its expansion of vegetarian items, Now I know that I won't be forced to eat a portobello sandwich, which is very tasty at Alchemy, but what vegetarian wants always to have to eat this or a veggie burger because nothing else is available for us? The maize salad is great --the small salad makes a whole meal. But the latest menu has gone too far. Alchemy should not be trying to prepare Southeast Asian food. I'm a connoisseur of it so was tempted by their Vietnamese Rice Noodle Salad. Unfortunately, it was atrocious. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Good place to drink. Good place to eat. They have lots of good beer and excellent nightly food specials. The service is good and the place feels neighborhood-y, which I like. Sometimes they have live music and djs which bring in fun crowds. They also have fun trivia every other Sunday."}
{"text":"Thoughtful drinks, and great sandwiches at refreshingly affordable prices. They could probably charge nearly twice as much if they wanted to. House boat and stuffed grilled cheese are personal favorites. Cash only."}
{"text":"Came here before a play at the Overture theatre.  Great place, with a great neighborhood feel to it.  Great selection of sandwiches.  I had the chicken breast, and my date had the bison burger.  We ended up sharing both, and they both were great.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm just now visiting this place!  This place is great.  The location is very centrally located to a lot of other eateries in the areas and if you are lucky you can find decent parking.  Upon walking I noticed that the place had a very laid back vibe.  There isn't a hostess waiting to greet you but I was quickly greeted and offered the open table.   Next I took a look at their drink menu and found a couple of unique drinks there that I mentally bookmarked for a future visit.  I ordered the steak which came with fries and a half a corn cob.   I really enjoyed the steak but was blown away by the corn.  It was so flavorful with seasoned butter and other flavors.    All in all, I really like this place.  I can't remember what my husband ordered but I know that he really enjoyed his meal. . There are lots of sandwiches and burgers on the menu that I cannot wait to try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Alchemy and Josh and Matthia and the rest of your effing wonderful staff, thanks for being awesome. Who knew this jumping little place would spring forth from the ruins of Wonder's? Y'all are going into your 3rd year of blissful success and I couldn't be prouder.  Keep on keeping on with your sweet potato  fries with the jam (and they are the jam), your rotating beers on tap, your salsa, burgers and your live and free @ Alchemy shows. I love you, Alchemy. I really effing do.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. The wait can get obnoxious since it's fairly small, but the excellent beer selection at the bar makes it worthwhile. The food is great. I loooove the sweet potato fries.   The one thing I could do without is the live music. The space is way too small to be able to hold a conversation over some crappy jam band."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch today - after a morning bike ride we were really hungry! My Zaremba burger was cooked perfectly although I thought we had to wait a while for our food. This is a strange complaint, I'm sure, but I really wished my burger came with lettuce. It had bacon, cheese, and a delicious green olive and shallot spread. But no lettuce. I did ask (and got) no tomato, so maybe the lettuce got forgotten? Fries were good but unremarkable.   Our servers were very attentive (lots of refills on soda and water!) nice interior with a raised bar area; there's also a few tables outside. A few TVs but not too many. Cash only (they have an ATM) and no separate checks. You're going to have to do the math yourself! I really liked this place and I'm sure I'll be back at some point."}
{"text":"Great place and great food!! Their sandwiches are amazing-especially they're STUFFED GRILLED CHEESE! I want to recreate that masterpiece, but haven't been successful yet.  They're sweet potato fries are also a winner. My only criticism is the lighting situation, sometimes it's a tad bit too dark. But then again, maybe it's just me. It goes with the nice ambiance,"}
{"text":"YUCK...skip! Easily the WORST BURGERS I've ever eaten. The burgers lacked flavor even with the toppings. We ordered: Applerum burger and Tinshack smokehouse burger. Both left a lot to be desired. The fries were not fries at all, more like potato chips (some thin and crispy & others thick). The sweet potato fries/chips were good but not  enough to return for.  POOR SERVICE. TEPID FOOD. The service left a lot to be desired also. She (the waitress) was behaving as though she was doing us a favor, oppose to her job.   The FLIES that kept landing on my plate was the last straw...I couldn't finish my food"}
{"text":"I was ready to bitch about how they don't take credit cards, how they were a little understaffed, and how we waited 15 minutes before the waitress took our order.   But then I had my first bite of a Zaremba burger and all of my bad feelings disappeared. This was probably the best burger I've had in Madison. My only complaint is that it could use a slightly firmer bun, but that's a minor complaint indeed. Absolutely delicious food and very reasonable prices mean that we'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The defining objective of alchemy is most famously known as transforming base metals into gold or silver. Alchemy the restaurant is most famously known for transforming base ingredients into delicious meals.   I've only had their burgers, which are all amazing. Even their vegetarian burgers are good. Try the Bella if you are not a meat eater; it's got a balsamic vinegar glazed portabella mushroom steak accompanied by gorgonzola ranch, fried leeks, tomato, lettuce, and swiss cheese between two soft, freshly-baked buns.   If you're looking a real burger, get the Zaremba burger (if it's still available; Alchemy's menu is seasonal and subject to change.) It's got bacon, a green olive and shallot salad, tomato and swiss sitting on top of a juicy 1/3 lb patty. Pure heaven. Add a side of cilantro cucumber quinoa salad and you have yourself the perfect meal.   In addition to amazing food, Alchemy also boasts a strong cocktail menu and beer selection. Not to mention live music some nights. If you have a Bike Benefits sticker, you get $1 off drafts. So...what are you waiting for? Come taste the magic."}
{"text":"Great menu with a good variety. The burger and quinoa side was amazing. Make sure you have cash, credit cards aren't accepted and checks aren't split. Highly recommend, will come again."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most underrated fish fry in Madison.  They prepare it with a lighter batter that has a bit of zing to it that's really unique.  It's rare that you find a solid craft beer bar that also cranks out good food too.  I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"Came for the sweet potato fries. They lived up to the hype!! The kombucha is like a light fruity tea. Cash only though! ATM is luckily located inside! Bartender Noel was awesome!"}
{"text":"A place where there is something for everyone. Super comfortable atmosphere with lots of daylight, wooden alcoves, and board games to play. Locally sourced food and artwork, which is always a good thing! Our service was good and both the meat and tofu burgers were great! Great variety of adult beverages. Cash or check only but there is an atm available in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food! Very imaginative menu with many flavors and themes.  Seems very farm to table, with local foods and offerings.   Daily specials, it seems, that the staff seemed very knowledgeable on.  I will say, that they (as many other reviewers stated) that they are a cash establishment only. Nor do they split checks. This is noted on the very top on the menu. Starting your menu off with all the things you won't do just sets the tone for a negative experience. Re word it, or hey, better yet - take cards. You are charging enough to pay the fees. Or add a 3% convenience fee. Something.  Also, they do offer a dog friendly patio. With that being said, the couple seated next to us allowed their dog to meander under our table, sniff our feet and generally just be in our space. This is not the fault of the restaurant, but for all that is good and holy, control your dog. Honestly, this is for selfish reasons only, as I (as a dog owner) would like to see more dog friendly establishments and don't want to see the privilege ruined by assholes.  I would definitely visit this location again."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite place in Madison; I can't say I had a regular spot, but this is as close as it gets. The burgers here are phenomenal -- large, not overcooked, with lots of inventive toppings -- but the food is quite good overall. They have a solid (and ever-changing) tap list, along with a couple good cocktails.  Alchemy isn't large, and the placement of the raised bar can make getting around awkward at times, but in general I've found this to be a supremely comfortable place to grab a meal and a beer. The servers and bartenders are always welcoming and attentive, and despite the weekend crowds, I've never felt rushed. It's cash-only of course, as many people have noted, but the ATM inside doesn't make it much of an inconvenience.  Not a whole lot I'd improve -- great casual food, nice atmosphere, and a lot of character."}
{"text":"Just stopped in and had a great lunch. This was my second time here and both times were very good."}
{"text":"Hands down: one of the best restaurants in Madison.  Their food is sourced locally, the chef's creations are delectable, the beer selection is top notch, and the ambiance is one of a kind. To be honest, I've never not liked anything I've tried, but here are some of my faves: the \"batch bread with Pâté\" is ALWAYS yummy, wasabi green beans are my fave side dish, the wings are the perfect amount of spicy, and their stuffed grilled cheese is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the local-ness of this little place.  Perfect for a date night and my go-to place to dine with Hubby in Madison!  I love the local ingredients used in the meals and the local bakery selections.  Its a pretty cozy place so you should be comfortable with that, and parking is a little iffy but well worth a little walk.  We would recommend almost everything on the menu!  Check it out!!  The only downfall is they don't accept credit cards, so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Went on a late Tuesday night; there was live jazz by young musicians and a solid crowd. Ate sweet potato fries for appetizer; they were tasty without too much oil, and the side condiments were flavorful, especially the spicy/sweet jam. BBQ Pork entree was good if not a bit too juicy, but good flavor. Side salad was excellent with interesting combo of ingredients of dried apple pieces, radishes, onions, mixed greens, and a tasty vinaigrette. Would go again and would recommend for quality of food, atmosphere, and service."}
{"text":"My friends from Madison took me here promising good food and a great beer. Alchemy did not disappoint.   I had the stuffed grilled cheese that was wonderful and unique. I had the house salad on the side, which was just ok- the dressing was a little off- but the sandwich made up for it.   One friend had the ravioli special and the other had a great burger. We were all completely satisfied with our meal.   Beers were great too. I'll definitely make a trip back here on my next stop in Madison!   Cash only- but they have an ATM on site if needed."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go here again.  Unique beer selection, cozy environment and fantastic food!  I had the stuffed grilled cheese which was nothing short of heaven on a plate. Whoever came up with that combo needs an award of some sort. The wasabi green beans I picked as a side were good, but I'd opt for a salad next time.   My significant other had the fish fry which was probably my third favorite fish fry ever. (Behind The Fireside and Old Fashioned).  I am aware that these statements are bold, but this place is good. If you're nearby give it a try."}
{"text":"I had the burger. Very tasty. My husband had the ribs which he enjoyed. Unfortunately the place only takes cash and as we did not have enough cash on us when we walked in we were told we could use their atm which would charge us $1. When we went to retrieve our cash to pay our tab the atm was \"out of bills\" and I was told to walk down the block to get cash from an atm at another establishment. I was flabbergasted and told the staff that it was 2015 I could not understand why they did not have a back up plan besides making their customers walk down the street for cash. Needless to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Alchemy - Transforming simple ingredients into great meals  The dictionary defines alchemy as any magical power or process of transmuting a common substance, usually of little value, into a substance of great value.  That pretty much sums up how I felt about my recent lunch visit.   They transformed a group of simple ingredients (spare ribs, a roll, swiss cheese, some greens and mayo ) into a memorable dining experience that far exceeded my expectations from a bar and grill setting.    I visited Alchemy on a Sunday morning after a leisurely October bike ride.  As soon as I walked in I realized I used to frequent this location years ago when it did business as Wonder's Bar.  Frankly, not much has changed and that''s a good thing.  Back in the day, I was a fan of the elevated bar, all the rustic woodwork and lots of natural light and the new owners maintained all those features.  The tabletops were clean as were the floors.  The volume level  of the TV was a little too high for my liking, but most of the bar patrons were there to watch the Packer game, so that was expected.  Service was great as well.  Our server was energetic, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   The drink and food orders were delivered promptly and our server stayed on top of beverage refills.    I ordered one of the daily specials, the pulled spare rib sandwich.  It was a good concept that was well executed by the kitchen.  The tender spare ribs were moist without being greasy.   While I'm usually not a huge fan of tarragon, but I liked the hint of tarragon in the mayo. it worked well with the other ingredients.  The sandwich was topped with a handful of fresh watercress that added a nice textural contrast.  An the roll used for the sandwich was fresh and was in proper proportion to the fillings.  The sandwich came with a side of wasabi green beans which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I usually avoid green beans since they tend to be overcooked, but I appreciated the fact these beans had a little crunch to them.  The wasabi seeds were a nice accent to the dish.   I was expecting the wasabi to dominate the dish, but it did not.    I was a little disappointed in the much-hyped sweet potato fries.  I thought they were fried too long, so the natural sweetness of the potato was masked by a  bitter aftertaste.  Some of that bitterness was overcome by dipping the fried in the jalapeno - blackberry jam that accompanied this dish.  The tarragon mayo that worked so well with my sandwich did not work as well with the fries.    Overall, I was impressed with the food and service offered by Alchemy - definitely a step above the typical bar and grill experience.  I plan to return to try more of the menu items."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison. The menu is creative and the drink selection is great. I come here every time I am in town and it never disappoints. The coconut curry veggies are great for vegetarians. The sweet potato fries are the best too."}
{"text":"Such a big fan of this place. One of my go to spots when my wife and I want to go out for a bite to eat.   Take note that it is cash only, they do have an ATM, so no need to go out of your way if you just want to come right to Alchemy from your house but have no cash.  The food here is spot on. Try anything, I mean that.   If you want some advice, try the wings & or sweet potato fries for an appetizer... you will not be disappointed. The spice and the flavor on the wings are right on point, even a little chocolaty. The dip for the fries will have you double dipping in no time.  Tinshack burger, portobello burger, grilled cheese w/ veggies are a few sandwiches to check out if that is your thing.   Try their special, whenever they have a special, just do yourself a favor and go for it.   If you aren't feeling the special then check out the Flank steak, ribs or fish tacos. Flavor for days.   Not to mention that this is a place that has a great atmosphere, w/ dim lighting that makes ya feel like you could just roll out of bed and stumble in for an amazing meal.   I even proposed to my wife at Alchemy. We moved away from Madison a couple years ago, but it is a place that we will always remember and reminisce about when thinking back on fun times in Madison. :)"}
{"text":"Alchemy stands out in a sea of generic bars. The food is inventive, locally inspired, and well prepared. I've never had a bad meal here. All sandwiches are tasty, including the vegetarian options, and I love that I can pair them with the always high quality/fresh/more-than-your-average-side-salad \"salad of the day.\" Over the years I've tried a few of the specials (pulled pork nachos and tilapia dinner come to mind) and they have not disappointed! Oh yeah, I should forget to mention the Midwest-centric craft beer on tap.  Be prepared to wait on a weekend evening and bring cash. It'll be worth it."}
{"text":"The alchemy was an adorable hippie-ish  restaurant with huge success.  Met a friend there for supper.  Ordered the vegetarian grilled cheese with chips and a salad and a lemonade.  The sandwich was magical with flavors marching together in perfect step...red onion, avocado, tomato, kale, mushrooms, and smoked Gouda cheese.  Salad came dressed in a sweet spicy vinaigrette dressing. Chips were thick and crisp and perfectly salted. The only bad thing was they don't take \"plastic\" like so many restaurants in the Marquette, so hit up the free ATM beforehand; there are a few in the neighborhood but they charge fees anywhere from $1.73-$3; or you'll be sweeping floors or doing dishes to work off your meal haha.  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This is such a warm friendly place with character located in a great neighborhood. You must come see for yourself! I had the burger special of the day which was great, the fries are amazing!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great little pub! We sat outside on a Friday evening and were able to enjoy their little sidewalk patio with our dog. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Weren't hungry enough for appetizers, but the entrees my husband and I ordered were both great. I had the deluxe version of the applerum burger with a dilled potato salad on the side. The burger was SO good, definitely a fan of that habanero aioli! The potato salad was very good too and a decent size for a side portion. My husband went for the Friday fish fry special, which was fresh and not overly greasy. My glass of wine was only $5 so aside from everything being wonderful, the entire meal was super cheap too!"}
{"text":"WHAT THE \"H\" MADISON? (I'll stop yelling.)  I'm not certain why the reviews for Alchemy aren't better, because they should be. Have you been there recently? Do you need to update a lackluster review? Do you need to write one because you love it and you haven't yet? Help these peeps out, more folks need to know about the awesomeness inside.   The place has (in my opinion of course) one of the best burgers on the Isthmus and their sweet potatoe fries/chips are out of this world good! You can sub the standard burger side for the sweet frites and they charge a nominal fee. It's worth it. The staff is simply delightful and the place serves the full menu pretty darn late.   Head there on a Thursday or Friday and you'll probably be treated to some tunes if you're there late enough. It gets loud, so know that if you're going in a group you'll be taking in the music more than the convo.   Parking sucks donkey balls but that's no reason to knock these guys. You'll have luck a little ways up on side streets.   So go.  Eat. Enjoy. Write.   I'm telling you, these guys deserve more credit than they're getting."}
{"text":"Every time we go here, I tell my dinnermates, \"This is the type of place I want to own some day.\"  The fries are killer (sweet potato and regular)--definitely dip them in the tarragon mayo.  Every time I've ordered the special it's been fantastic.  The grilled cheese is probably the best grilled cheese that's ever happened in the history of grilled cheese (I recommend ordering it with bacon).  Don't get the steak--I've had two people say it sucks.  But everything else on the menu is damn worth it.  YES, it's cash only, and YES, that does catch you by surprise if you're not a regular (or sometimes if you are and you drink a lot, like I do)... but at least their ATM usually works.  Would definitely be 5 stars for food and service alike if it weren't for the cash only issue and the aforementioned subpar steak."}
{"text":"Alchemy is one solid joint in Madison. I've been twice and haven't had anything bad. Between the great food and the stellar service how can you not give it a five star review? Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is perfect for being a neighborhood joint.   This particular visit we had the wings, french fries as well as enjoyed a few beers plus had the mushroom bisque. Wow was that soup good! Alchemy seems to always have a soup bubbling up in the kitchen and this weeks soup was no disappointment. As a matter of fact the entire lunch was excellent. I really wanted to order a burger too but being that we had dinner plans i couldn't stuff my face fully!   We will be back again, that is a given as our Madison framily only lives a couple of blocks away. As always I expect Alchemy to be serving up the goods correct as they should! Also the place only takes cash but don't fret they have an ATM that is only a whopping 1 dollar surcharge. Good job on that!"}
{"text":"The menu has some interesting items. The dolamades were very good. I feel the have a unique style, although it is a subtle one and hard to place. The menu has a surprising variety that you wouldn't expect from a first glance. They were very accommodating to my vegan friend, although the choices for vegans are somewhat slim. It is definitely worth checking out and a good place for just chillin' with friends"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Very good food.  Bands and trivia and stuff there all the time."}
{"text":"Alchemy is one of my new favorite restaurants in town!   The food is delicious! I've tried the butternut squash soup (seasonal), butternut squash sandwich, wasabi green beans (yum!), sweet potato chips, portabella pate with grilled bread (unique, vegetarian, and yummy!). All food is delish!!!! They have fun coctails at decent prices, too, such as the Philosopher's Stone (run with ginger beer) and awesome Old Fashions.   Four stars because seating can be a challenge at times, especially if you have more than 4 people in your party."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this new place. The staff tend to be young hipsters- eh.  Service leaves a bit to be desired, from my experience... A friend and I were all but ignored by a female bartender there recently. The music is often too loud to dine/converse comfortably. I don't really go to this place for beer- not when The Ideal is right next door.  UPDATE: After giving Alchemy numerous chances- and even though the food can be really good sometimes-  I GIVE UP! The service SUCKS. Snotty, inattentive, and downright RUDE. I am done with it. One star from me at this point."}
{"text":"This was a cute place to go on a Wednesday night for date night. It wasn't too busy, but busy enough that you know people enjoy it here. They have a nice selection of craft beer on tap that many places in town don't have. I got a lavender honey ale and it was good. My partner had a buffalo Mac and cheese that he loved--I think they undersold how spicy it was though! If you like spice I recommend! I had a stuffed grilled cheese, which wasn't really stuffed it was more just bread with cheese and a pile of raw vegetables on top. I had fries with it but their fries were nothing special. I think this place was good, but I wasn't blown away by their food. I like to go to a place where they make something I couldn't make or I wouldn't have thought of and this did not impress me in that regard."}
{"text":"When I first moved to the Atwood area, I actively avoided eating at the Alchemy. It just seemed so hipster and was likely to be incredibly overrated as everyone kept telling me \"it's the best\".  Almost all of our friends somewhat regularly hang out at the Ideal, so naturally the Alchemy is an easy and convenient choice for post beverage eating. The first time I went, I ordered The Matilda which is a sandwich with squash and some other stuff on it. I was NOT impressed. I didn't think it was good at all and the restaurant is a little pricey so I was especially disappointed.  Some years went by when I flat out refused to eat there and give in to the hype of a not even good restaurant - which I feel happens with A LOT of restaurants in Madison and I avoid them.  Eventually, I gave in. My fiance loves the Alchemy and he ALWAYS wanted to eat there. I decided to give it another chance. This time I ordered the steak. It was fabulous. The restaurant wasn't insanely busy and the service was great and quick.  We literally go there ALL. THE. TIME. now. Seriously. At least once every two weeks. Now I pretty much always order the flank steak. It comes with a seasonal vegetable and mashed potatoes. The vegetables so far since I started going back have been Brussels sprouts with some kind of delicious sauce and now it's collard greens with bacon. Both are absolutely DELICIOUS. Cooked perfectly almost every time and just so dang good! The steak is always awesome no matter how I order it cooked. Mashed potatoes are legit my favorite food in the world so you can't really go wrong there.  ALSO, Tuesday is $12 bottle of wine night. That's right. A whole bottle. $12. (The organic wines are $15 but still a heck of a deal!). We go there on A LOT of Tuesdays.  All in all, I was so skeptical of the Alchemy. I gave it a chance and it disappointed me. I gave it another chance, and it is now one of my absolute FAVORITE restaurants in Madison. I love it!"}
{"text":"Yelp, yelp, yelp.  Sometimes you really need to have a half star option, because this place is really 3.5 stars in my book.  Three seems too little, four too much.  I've been hearing good things about Alchemy for years, and finally made it out there for a business lunch last week.  Service was a little slow and disorganized.  We sat for a while before anyone came around with waters, and then almost simultaneously two waitresses showed up to greet us and with glasses of water.  Neither asked if we were ready to order, and both disappeared just as quickly.  It was a while longer before our server returned to take our order.  This being my first time, I asked the server for a recommendation out of a couple of items and she wholeheartedly recommended the BLFT.  There are a lot of things to like about the sandwich.  The fried tomato lends a nice warmth to the traditional BLT, but tasted more like oil than tomato.  The aoli, which I was concerned would be overpowering, was much more subtle and blended into the overall taste quite well.  The fries were something special.  No one came by to refill our waters, and when I asked for more it took long enough for someone to return with a pitcher that we had finished our meals by then.  We were brought the wrong bill, but our server noticed (I didn't), and fixed it for us - it then took a long time for our server to pick up our payment and bring change.  Alchemy seems like a great fit for the neighborhood, and I'd definitely go back, but so far it's not top of my list."}
{"text":"The great and interesting burgers drew me to Alchemy. After eating here many times, I've discovered that they do a great job with their food in general. I've been consistently surprised at their ability to do great with many different types of food."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and great live music. I highly recommend the bison burger and sweet potato fries. They don't charge a cover but come with cash because they don't accept cards."}
{"text":"The Tinhouse burger, the soup, the beer, the atmosphere are awesome but take a back seat to the amazing fries!   I haven't had fries like that since I was a kid! Service was great, food was great and came out quick.  I'm definitely putting this on my \"places to eat\" list!"}
{"text":"WE LOVE ALCHEMY!  I've only been here to listen to live bluegrass music a couple evenings, but every visit has been pleasant! They have a really good beer selection and delicious food. The sweet potato fries were great and their batch bakery grilled bread is worth coming back for.  Alchemy definitely has a local \"feel\" to it with a lot of personality."}
{"text":"This is an incredibly overrated place. It's pretentious and the food is garbage. I've never had so many people recommend such a below average place in my life. I don't understand how anyone could think anything on the menu is at all above average. I've been there several times and paid for disappointing food every single time. And the people that work there are pretentious little bitches too, sorry for being so frank but I can't come up with more accurate words. The overrated alchemy is worthless, so don't even bother. You will only find douchebags and disappointing food accompanied by an incredibly uncreative and bland beer and drink menu."}
{"text":"Great place for a laid back dinner. The food is always good and they have a nice cocktail menu. It's small, cozy and a bit dark. They also have a bar if you are just interested in a drink. I know they do some live music as well, but I haven't been there for that. Alchemy is always a good option and someplace pretty much everyone can find something they'll love."}
{"text":"This dive is amazing. I do not write many reviews but this place is fantastic. First the wait staff. We showed up early for a dinner with friends and sat at the bar. Drinks were priced competitively. The alchemy accommodated a party of 9 without hesitation. The wait staff serving the table was fast, friendly, and efficient. The food even though it was busy was quick and delicious. I had the bison burger. The burger was cooked to my order of medium and topped with fresh ingredients. The fries were fresh cut and excellent. I also recommend the clam soup. The Alchemy makes a great mid town dinning experience and I will return."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Alchemy experience so much I've been twice in the past week....despite the cold and rain I had to walk through!  Not only is it a great bar, but the food is amazing...so much better than the average bar food you'll find at other places.  We've brought out of town friends here a couple of times so far and everyone thinks it is great!  Last night I had the hanger steak with rosemary red wine reduction and blue cheese....SO GOOD I've been craving that dish ever since.  The atmosphere is great-with the mirrors it looks much better than it really is but it has the cozy local feel that make you want to come again and again.  I'm really glad I found a new local spot to return to again and again!  #yelpnewvember"}
{"text":"If you are reading this review it means you probably haven't been to the Alchemy yet.  Quit reading and get over there! The Alchemy is a great place to try a new heady micro brew and to get a delicious meal filled with locally sourced ingredients.  The tap list is always changing and there is always a special to try. The Alchemy is also a good spot for late night music.  The groups they book are phenomenal.  The only downside is because of their strange, multi-teered floor plan, its not much fun when it is really busy.  Still, the Alchemy is 5 stars and the sweet potato fries  are a must!  \"Hey Alchemy, what you cookin in the back? Sweet potato fries with no trans-fat!\" ~The Mustache"}
{"text":"Finally at the famous Alchemy, which is recommended by every friend who have been here before. They have GREAT burgers. The ingredients are all so fresh and wonderfully mixed together in flavor and texture."}
{"text":"The food at this place rocks! and it is consistent. We've been going there  regularly for a few years now and never had a bad meal. Service is usually very fast and efficient albeit not so friendly. Place can be loud when busy so don't expect to have a meaningful conversation but the food is a great value for the price. It's also one of the few places in this area that serves food after 11 PM."}
{"text":"Great sweet potato fries. Good other stuff. Open late, so it's really convenient. Often quite loud."}
{"text":"I have frequented the Alchemy for about 4 years now and have tried at least half the menu, as well as various specials they've offered.  I've never had a bad dish.  The sweet potato fries with tarragon mayo and jalapeno blackberry jam are an absolute must.  The wasabi beans are the perfect amount of spicy-hot.  They always have a fresh selection of microbrews on tap and every server we've had has been knowledgeable about them all. The muddled cranberry mojito and the Philospher's Stone (somewhat similar to a moscow mule) are my favorite cocktails they offer. The one item I have not explored much are the desserts they offer.  However, I can speak on the rest of their menu, and every dish we've had has been delicious and prepared with care.    Some things to note - Alchemy often has live music starting at around 9 or 10 at night.  It tends to get quite busy by about 7 o clock.  They are cash-only; they do have an ATM which charges a nominal $1 fee, but sometimes it's out of order.  The ATM across the street at the Stop-N-Go charges $2.25, so it pays to hit up a cheaper ATM beforehand!"}
{"text":"The cocktail selection is very fun. The food is such a great price for the quality and quantity! There is a nice variety of vegetarian and carnivorous. The atmosphere is warm and cozy."}
{"text":"Great, lots of locally sourced ingredients, full menu available late at night, quirky/vegan/veg/foodie options, nice atmosphere. With the exception of the Friday night DJ who was super excited to bring reggae culture to the forefront and who played Shaggy for an 8th grade flashback, this place is a must visit. Fair warning, and I did know ahead of time, but just to pass it on, they don't take cards, so bring cash."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Madison.  Went recently and got the grilled cheese and butternut squash soup. Both quite tasty. Would recommend either if you go.  Service was prompt and friendly. The bartender was extra friendly. I got a mimosa and they gave me the tiny bottle as a sidecar!  I was a little weary about going hear knowing how much I love the Owl next door, but this place was just as great!"}
{"text":"Went to Alchemy today because my friend was craving a burger. I had never dined here before, but she had and suggested it. I was thoroughly impressed. She had the bison burger which was to die for, I had a bite and instantly wanted another. I ordered the BLFT and it was loaded with bacon and flavor. I had some minor issues with it, first being that there was just a little too much aioli on the bread and second that the fried tomato was a red tomato and not a green tomato. I just found the texture of the tomato unappetizing. I also enjoyed their bloody mary and they have a nice local, craft beer selection. For dessert we had the espresso torte and it was one of the best I have ever had. Service was also spot on and I will be returning soon to get the bison burger for myself!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad experience at Alchemy. What I like the most is for the price of what your paying to what you get. The quality of there food is so good and everything is delicious. I can't believe I only pay $14 for their hanger steak entrée. They could easily charge more and other restaurants probably do.  Besides their hanger steak they have excellent burgers and sandwiches. Last time we were there my husband and I shared a salad. I forget the name but it had a ton of veggies and garbanzo beans with sweet and tangy dressing. They also have a good selection of beers and cocktails.  They also have nightly specials but come early because they often sell out. Its a smaller space so sometimes there is a wait but definitely worth it. You can sit at the bar and kinda see into the kitchen which is fun to watch too."}
{"text":"Had the Bella sandwich and Alchemy fries. It was fabulous! I will definitely return...maybe tomorrow...and I live in Green Bay...yeah, it's that good. My only complaint is that they don't take credit."}
{"text":"Pricey! But the food was sooooooo good!!!!!! Again another one of those places in Madison which are good to go once in a while.  Update: We went here again last weekend and yet again the food was YUMMMM!!!! Pricey as usual but delicious delicious food! Different menu than the first time we went. When asked for previous items waitress mentioned menu changed for Friday because of small kitchen and small fryer (I am surprised by the fast service with a small kitchen!) Well, we got to try new items on their menu. Very crowded and very very loud and dim lighting but it was lovely ambience. I didn't mind the noise.  I wish the staff smiled more. Both times staff rarely smiled but the service was good. Only setback they accept only cash."}
{"text":"I friggin' love Alchemy.  The one downside is that they are very frequently busy, which is okay, because that gives you time to go over to One Barrel Brewing.  Their food is thoughtfully coordinated and their prices are pretty low considering the quality.  (I think one of the ways they keep prices low is by only accepting cash.)  The beer list is usually very strong.  I'd be lying if I said that the atmosphere didn't play a role in my ardor for this spot.  The restaurant is mostly older wood (bar, tables, floor), and very intimate and dark.  There are a few windows for natural light, but for the most part it is very cozy.  I totally recommend going and getting the buffalo wings (not available on Fridays because of the Fish Fry)!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has arguably the best sweet potato friends in Madison!!!  Happened to be in the neighborhood so we decided to stop for a late lunch and my husband had the brisket sandwich which was great, but those fries...seriously!  Decent craft beer selection and the stepped height seating areas in the restaurant are fun to people watch!  Glad we stopped!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of things going for it. To name a few: - One of the best fish fry dishes in town. Very filling and they make an amazing breading - Dishes I've had have all been good: The reuben is made with brisket and kimchi which make a stellar combination. The salad selection is limited but solid. Don't skip the fries if you like the thin-crispy style pseudo-chips with a house-made ketchup. - Beer selection is varied in palate and diverse in origin, with a loving nod to some of the midwest breweries of renown.  - Live music is always pleasant. The space's acoustics lend themselves to the jazz quartet we heard there. - Patio in the hippest part of Madison (in my opinion) - Nice bar (one barrel) and divey bar (ideal bar) nearby while you wait for a table - Friendly service and a good crowd. - Quiet enough for a conversation, the atmosphere is 'chill'   Cons: - Cash only, but they have an ATM - Often crowded, see my comment about nearby bars for waiting - A bit dark at night. Doesn't bother me but my girlfriend likes the brighter tables  Overall a great spot. They have me hooked."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon here from Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. Thanks, my fellow Yelpers! There were a lot of pictures and tips to get the BLFT and/or stuffed grilled cheese, but I'm a man who needs his meat!   Instead, I went with the grilled chicken breast sammich, called the House Boat.The House boat had this extremely flaky fluffy bread, too flaky for me, but then again, I'm more of a unleavened bread type of person. The House Boat was served with jalapeno relish, tomato, greens and gorgonzola. I got the habenero basil aioli on the side, along with their house fries, which resembled more like potato chips -- not crunchy, or soggy. It's weird -- when it comes to chips, I like em generally crunchy, kettle-styled. Regardless, the sandwich was very tasty.  They have a small outdoor dining area, three small tables, and are dog-friendly. Food came out fast, service was really good and informative, and overall, a pretty nice lunch dining experience.  BATHROOM REVIEW: Located past the kitchen, the mens bathroom consisted of a few urinals and stalls. Decently lit, and clean, the bathroom did it's job. SIt or squat? Squat."}
{"text":"I really like Alchemy. I've been coming here on and off for several years now, and I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience.   Some of the low reviews, especially the folks upset about Alchemy being \"cash only\" really surprise me. I guess those who are not familiar with the area might find the \"cash only\" strange, however, anyone who frequents the Atwood/Willy neighborhood would know that this is pretty standard practice. Players, Harmony, The Ideal, Mr. Roberts, Mickey's, Crystal Corner, (to name a few) are all cash only establishments. It's just this area of town.   But back to Alchemy. YUM! Everything I have ever tried here has been delicious. A few favorites include: -Stuffed Grilled Cheese (sans cilantro) -BBQ Pork  -Buffalo Wings -House Fries  The atmosphere is usually somewhat upbeat whenever I am there. Live music periodically which is fun. The live music does tend to drown out all chances of a nice conversation, which can be slightly annoying. When there is room, I like to sit up at the bar. It's elevated and gives you a nice vantage over the whole place. The bartenders have always been great, and the cocktails always tasty! Service has always been speedy, as well.   The inside of the building itself is quite interesting. Multi-level dining room almost gives it a snug feel. Woodwork is nice. Skylights let in lots of natural light. Rotating artwork from local artists. Overall, I really like what they have done with the space.   Only downfall is sometimes finding parking can be a challenge. That's minor though."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Matilida.  Last time I got it, it was a little short on the squash and amazing gorgonzola herb dressing, but still a great sandwich. I've tried a significant amount of food from their menu, and it's all very fresh, very well prepared and creative.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for affordable, quality food.  Their winter fries: purple potato are unbeatable.  I love them so much, I've attempted duplicating the recipe at home. The secret is malt vinegar and salt overnight, so I've been told.  Great dips, great appetizers, good dessert.  Affordable specials, nice atmosphere.  If you are in a rush, go at an odd hours, this place can get busy during peak eating hours.  One of my go-to spots when I'm in Madison.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Friendly service. There's a bar, but it has a restaurant feel to it. Skylights and plenty of windows keep it well lit. Pleasant outside seating. Delicious and unique foods."}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner. We tried the raved about sweet potato fries, really good! Whoever thought of pairing the jam: brilliant! I had the wings. Wow! Really different, and really good! HUGE wings, which I generally don't love, but the flavor is fabulous! Took quite a few home too. Hubby had the perch tacos. He wasn't as pleased with his meal as I was. He said they were ok. Got the flourless chocolate cake to go, haven't tried it yet, but it looks right.. We will return. I want to try the flank steak..."}
