{"text":"This place has gone downhill tremendously. I just had a baby roach drop out of the takeout bag. Never again."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive! And with all of those options, I always end up getting the Mixed Vegetables with Garlic Sauce. Their sauce has a kick, but it's not too spicy. There are a wide variety of veggies, which I love! My boyfriend is more adventurous and tries new things every time we order from here. He has not been disappointed yet. This place is our go-to for Chinese food in Swissvale! 

*Also, last night I bought some of the homemade sweet-tea they make. It's $1.75/quart and definitely worth it! It's a bit sweeter than I like, so I added some water and it was perfect!!"}
{"text":"It's actually a fast food restaurant, however, the food is a mix of Chinese and Western. It lost its original flavor esp. those Sichuan food which should be spicy to be called Sichuan dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious food, clean establishment, quick and friendly service. Just about perfection for strip mall Chinese food."}
{"text":"Do you like basic Chinese food? Of course you do, this place is fast and tasty. Take out or eat in! I love the shrimp toast! They also make their own sweet tea that is divine. 

Is this the fanciest place for lunch or dinner, not at all but it's exactly what you want when you have a hankering for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Their food is always pretty tasty, although perhaps a little heavily sauce for my tastes, but I'd rather too much sauce than not enough. I'm not a fan of their appetizers much, other than the yummy egg rolls. They make their crab rangoon and fried wonton a little differently than most Chinese joints. 

The best part is the staff, they are always smiling and friendly, ask how you're doing when you come in, and remember you if you're a regular."}
{"text":"Passable, cheap Chinese food. I like the Kung Pao chicken, but they definitely put in too many carrots."}
{"text":"Just skip this place. I kinda knew I'd be getting mediocrity, because the reviews reflect that it's just \"okay,\" but I didn't expect our experience to be just flat out BAD.

I ordered a sweet and sour chicken combination plate, my husband ordered a chicken chow mein combination plate, and we got our son a small bowl of chicken and broccoli. We also ordered fried cheese wontons and egg rolls. To their credit, the sweet and sour chicken was actually pretty good. When I go to a Chinese place I've never been before I usually go for something that's pretty fool-proof and my method paid off this time. The fried rice was terrible; it contained no egg and not ONE piece of pork, which the menu claimed it would. Pork fried rice should include pork. 

We're new Pittsburghers from California and back home, chow mein means a plate of noodles. My husband got an extremely pale plate of... onions and zucchini, I think? The chicken looked cooked but the whole meal, overall, looked fairly pale and unappetizing. It came with \"crispy fried\" noodles to mix into it but they tasted stale and didn't do much for it. We threw that entire meal away. 

Pros:
-sweet and sour chicken was good
-fried cheese wontons were good

Cons:
-food didn't seem entirely fresh, even though it's supposed to be made-to-order
-menu confusion resulted in a kind of \"too bad\" shrug from the staff
-overall disappointing for the amount of money paid

We really wanted some fast, affordable, Chinese food but I think from now on we'll just stick to the short drive to Squirrel Hill for the good stuff. We left feeling like we wasted a lot of money and time on this place."}
