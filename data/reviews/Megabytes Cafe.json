{"text":"Cook staff is less than friendly and lacks the ability to cook a proper quesadilla.  Cheese to chicken ratio was off as well as barely above warm. Chicken was pre-cooked boiled and no seasoning.  The staff at the registers is always friendly and quick to help with a smile.  I'd like to see the same attention to detail and love for the job done by the cook staff."}
{"text":"M Culinary is the new operator of Megabytes. So far they have been above average although a bit pricey. They serve only breakfast and lunch.

I've had several items from their breakfast menu including oatmeal, breakfast burritos and their version of an egg McMuffin.  The oatmeal was a little runny, I think they might be using quick oats instead of steel cut oats. I prefer oatmeal with a bit more texture. The eggs were scrambled for the burrito. The burrito was good. The egg, sausage, cheese on an English muffin was good but cost $4. The Mc fast food place down the road provides two for $3.33 all day long. 

From the lunch menu I have enjoyed the Cuban sandwich with homemade potato chips and bottle of water. Roughly $9. They also have a hot grill for burgers, quesadilla's. Most are pretty good. The daily specials are served from a Entre menu which changes daily. On a couple of occasions they served a boneless, skinless chicken breast. In a word: horrible. Dry and  flavorless. I think they might be reheating a frozen precooked chicken breast. 

On a positive I tried a bone in, with skin, barbeque wing and breast with garlic mashed and carrots. This meal was very good.  I hope that they continue with interesting entre's .

Three stars due to the high price and terrible pre cooked boneless skinless chicken breast."}
{"text":"Great amenity for a company to have.  The staff is friendly and does a great job.  Both the management and Chef are very accessible and visible in the cafe and for the many catered events that I have attended.   Food is innovative for a company cafe enKeep up the good work!"}
