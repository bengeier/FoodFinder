{"text":"Loved the Masala fries as suggested by a yelper. I had the Masala noodles with chicken, shrimp, and beef. It was alright, big portion. It was empty except for the table full of family members/friends staring at me while I eat."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It is 1000 times better than regular Chinese food. All of their vegetarian dishes are delicious and their veggie fried rice is way better than regular Chinese fried rice because they use basmati and it isn't all greasy. This is my #1 take-out choice."}
{"text":"Just ok in my opinion.  5 Spices tastes like Indian food with an attempt to add some Chinese flavours.  Maybe the owners were looking to differentiate themselves on Gerrard where there are plenty of other Inidan restaurants to choose from.  I much prefer the Hakka food at Danforth Dragon."}
{"text":"Restaurant is CLOSED down. 

For rent sign in front window.

I called the telephone number just in case they moved before I posted this review and the gentleman who answered confirmed they are closed."}
{"text":"I met 5 of my friends here for lunch on Thursday, and last night I went back with my lovely wife.

For lunch on Thursday, we split a number of dishes, all of which were good, but when you start to have that many dishes, there is a lot of overlap in flavours.

As others have described, 5 Spices dishes are definitely more Chinese-styled (cornstarch laden, thick shiny sauces) but with Indian flavours. Unfortunately, you won't find ingredients like broccoli or eggplant. The most \"exotic\" vegetable was cauliflower.

My favourite dish both visits was an appetizer called Chinese Bhel, a crispy, noodley delight. Try it and thank me later.

My wife described the dishes as \"comfort food\". Don't expect nouveau cuisine, but if you want good flavours and hearty dishes, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"HISTORY/ABOUT: The 5 Spices restaurant is located just east of the legendary Lahore Tikka Houses, and specializes in Hakka (Indian/Chinese) cuisine. 
 
DÃ‰COR/AMBIENCE: The restaurant is nothing special, but it is clean. The food warrants eating here despite the ordinary atmosphere, trust me. 
 
MENU DESIGN/READABILITY: Way more options then I'd like to see on a menu, but this is typical of a Hakka/Indian/Chinese restaurant. 
 
FOOD QUALITY: Delicious. Meats were extremely tender and seasoned beautifully. Hakka food, similar to Indian, is always bursting with flavour. The marinades, combination of spices and use of woks makes for palette paradise. I highly recommend the masala fries, Chicken 65 Bombay Chicken (heavy peanut flavour), and the rices and noodles are all tasty. I have to go back for the fish and beef dishes.
 
BOOZE: No
 
PRICE POINT: Extremely reasonable, nearly every item on the menu is under $10. 
 
SERVICE: Great service. Was not busy when I was there 
 
BATHROOMS: never used
 
FINAL THOUGHTS: If you would like to experience Hakka food this is a great restaurant to visit.

{"text":"Reviewers like Mary obviously don't know what they are talking about. 5 Spices is billed as an \"Indian Chinese\" restaurant and it's pretty darn good at that. Having grown up in India - where \"Hakka\" refers to \"Indian Chinese\" food I can attest 5 Spices is definitely one of the best \"Indian Chinese\" restaurants in the GTA. If you are not looking for Chinese food with an Indian flavour/spices then this restaurant is not for you. The 5 Spices chicken is definitely the best item on the menu (caution: it is spicy) and the vegetarian schezwan fried rice is great too. Full disclosure: these two dishes are our staple when we order from here, which is usually once a week."}
{"text":"I brought home a meal from 5 Spices, and was pleased.

Let's get the Hakka thing out of the way.  First of all, I'll say that 5 Spices bills themselves as Indian Chinese cuisine rather than explicitly as Hakka.  And I can't claim to be a Hakka expert even by local standards.  I'd been given to understand that what most people call Hakka is chinese-style dishes with indian-style spices (although Wikipedia points out that the cuisine traditional to the Hakka region is actually something else).  I've had food at The Danforth Dragon, but I didn't find it was radically different from Chinese Food.  

That said, we ate the vegetarian spring rolls and manchurian beef, both of which I was pretty pleased with.  The spices were definitely strong, and tasted more like Indian spices than chinese ones.  The dishes had a fair kick of flavor and spice 'heat'.

We also had the chicken fried noodles, which were more subtle, but still pleasant, and the Veg. Sweet and Sour, which I was less enthused by.  It was still reasonable, but I had a hard time relating the sauce to 'sweet and sour', and the vegetable balls were a little mushy (perhaps by design, but I would have liked them slightly more firm).

The price seemed reasonable ($26 for the above dishes, including rice), the service was friendly.  There was no-one else in the restaurant, although it was a late week-day lunch, so I don't read too much into it.

Basically, I was happy with my meal and would order from them again."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for so long but whenever I go to Little India I already have my plan so have never been. Oh my gosh, I'm going again.

My pallet just didn't know what was going on...it was so interesting. 
I would say it was more chinese tasting than Indian, but then dosed in a bit of Indian spice. The staff were all Indian, the decor was all Chinese. Super interesting and well balanced. 
The staff were so cute, they were so concerned about our satisfaction. Kept saying thank you thank you when we'd say we were interested, or liked something.
Definitely the best veggie pakoras I have had in a very very very very long time. 
And the prices were quite decent. 
We had the fish curry on the hakka platter, all the other parts of the meal were veggie and more chinese style: veggie noodles, veggie rice and veggie spring roll. 
Then we ordered a crispy chilli fried veggie which was DELICIOUS. Not the most interesting veggie-cauliflower and carrots-but they were fried in batter than doused in indian masala sauce stuff. Wow.......mmmmm....
So good!
And then I had indian chai. 
Yummm. 

I have to go back because there were so many things on the menu I need to try...next will be the lollipop chicken (yummy looking breaded and spiced chicken drumsticks)!"}
{"text":"Closed, building for Lease or /sale

The food is fine but they burn a very cheap outdoor temple incense (according to local Indians that have walked in, a horrible smell , this incense overpowers the indoor air.

On Facebook every customer (six that live in the area) commented food is good, but only take-out, never eat in due to smell (similar to a unwashed 5 day old mop)

Most restaurants burn a light pleasant incense sandal wood.

When I tracked down the smell they were offend,

ate there twice stunk both time never again

Seems to be closed for business, no longer has the Toronto green dept of health Sign"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my wife and two children.  I found the management and staff of the establishment to be very professional, and they provided excellent service.  The restaurant itself is very clean and crisp, not that I have any negative animus towards holes in the wall, but for Gerard street this place has a modern, tidy and polished look.  

The food is excellent, and extends beyond the traditional Hakka Indian-Chinese of manchurian and chop suey.  It included things I had never tried like Chinese Bhel, and an interesting Sino influenced version of Chicken Tikka Masala--though the name for it was completely different.  

If you come in with an open mind, I think that you will find the food fantastic.  There were some comments by other reviewers that this was not authentic Chinese cuisine--yeah, that's right its not supposed to be.  If you order a pizza and complain that it doesn't taste anything like a bowl of spaghetti you'd be right but you'd hardly have a right to complain.

My advice is go there, order food, keep an open mind, and eat to your heart's content.  My only quibble is that as a side condiment they offer green chilli slices in vinegar--which is pretty traditional for some Chinese and Thai places--and which I generally love.  The problem is that the highly acidic flavours dont marry well with Indian-Chinese the way that they do with Thai.  Not a biggie, you don't actually have to use the condiments put on the table..."}
{"text":"This review is based on 3 things primarily: taste, service, accuracy

Taste was alright. Nothing extravagant really. Being from Chicago, I have come across better.
Service was great. As my wife and I entered, we were greeted very politely. We were there to do a take out.
My wife ordered a paneer manchuran. Obviously a vegetarian dish.
Once we got back to the hotel,  we realized that it was indeed chicken and not paneer. Being an Indian myself, I find it appalling that an Indian owned restaurant would make an error of this nature. 
I called the restaurant right away. The girl I spoke to recognized us right away. She verified with the kitchen and confirmed that what they made was indeed chicken and not paneer. 
She apologized several times and offered to replace it next time we r there.  Of course I told her that is not necessary. 
Do try the place out bit if doing take out, I suggest double checking your order before leaving."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst places I have been to for indian chinese food. We went here for lunch on a weekend and the place was empty. There were a couple of folks that did a takeout but that's about it. Service was friendly but food was terrible. They tend to add a lot of artificial color to make the dishes vibrant. Avoid the chicken lollipops, they did not taste fresh and we had to send them back. To salvage some pride, they did not charge us for this dish. We made our way out quickly not caring for the food, in fact we only had a couple of bites. Please do not go here if you are expecting haka style indian chinese food, sadly this place is far from it. I am already missing Inchin's bamboo garden in Seattle :("}
