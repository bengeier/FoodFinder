{"text":"Kudos to the mastermind(s) behind this place! While standing in line watching all of the fantastic looking yummi-ness coming from behind the counter, I had to step aside because I couldn't decide! Finally, I ordered the Passion Fruit fusion tea and a couple of macaroons. Oh.my.gosh. Quite possibly the best non-alcoholic drink that I have ever tasted. It had very little ice and was loaded with fruit pieces. I just about inhaled the macaroons as well. So good; will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This has fast become our favorite place to get some popcorn shrimp,  jasmine tea or coffee, dessert, and just relax. Everything we have tried so far has been fresh, flavorful, and unique. 

My husband took me there on my birthday recently and surprised me with a beautiful table set up with rose petals and dessert. I am very grateful to Jimmy, the owner, and his staff for helping him set up a lovely surprise. It meant a lot to me and really made Tea Fusion more than just a cool place, but a genuinely friendly one. 

You can read my first review for more details, but suffice to say you have a good chance of running into us there!"}
{"text":"Came in here last week with some friends since I heard good things about this place. We order bubble tea and the mason jar tea, some cakes and popcorn chicken and popcorn shrimp. It tasted good but the prices was little high for the amount they give you. It comes it a box and look like such a small portions of it, not enough to share, or let alone one person. For price it should be given more. But overall it good staff was very friendly and the environment was clean will definitely return to have the  only for Manson jar tea again."}
{"text":"Tried most of the tea flavor and it was delish!!! My favorite are peach perfection and passion fruit tea!! Lovedd it!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to grab a drink/snack! Their teas are amazing! Chill and clean environment too. Highly recommended to anyone."}
{"text":"Clean, delicious, friendly, and a very relaxed environment . I always go for the teas (of course) They also have Bhan Mi's on the menu that I am dying to try!"}
{"text":"Great place to come and grab a drink. I came due to my niece's recommendation and I'm glad I did. I ended up getting the passion fruit lemonade and it was amazing. The drinks came out in mason jars, filled with fruit and jellies. Beautiful presentation and absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The passion fruit tea was the bomb and one of the most unique drinks that I've ever had. It's filled to the brim with Apple pieces and lots of tasty jellies.. No wonder it's the most popular drink. 

We were visiting Charlotte and found Tea Fusion Cafe through Yelp and I think we struck gold. 

It's a really inviting space with lots of tables and couches in a stylish setting. During our short visit, we were provided amazing service and were even shown how to enjoy the tea from the owner! 

For a place that just opened, they are making prime drinks so I'll come back anytime I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went to tea fusion for some tea after visiting my favorite restaurant near by Le kebab . I  was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the mango milk boba tea and it was delicious . I can't wait to go back to try more flavors. Very happy it's in a very convenient location as well ."}
{"text":"I still need to go back to try the Vietnamese coffee especially after the wonderful history lesson I got about it. Bubble tea I got with fruit was really good. Great place to meet people, especially if your looking for something that's not fussy."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love coming here after class and getting one of their amazing bubble teas with a couple delicious macaroons, or occasionally their succulent popcorn chicken. You have to try their Taro or Honeydew bubble tea or you're missing a serious pleasure of life."}
{"text":"A long day after work and I want to relax. Tea fusion cafe makes the perfect green tea bubble tea. Frozen creamy green tea flavor with the tapioca bubbles that are fun to chew. Jazz plays in the background and I drift into a greater plane."}
{"text":"Great service, super friendly staff. Did not get anything but bubble tea to go but it was amazing!!!! Best bubble tea I've had in awhile. Cool space too. Would definitely come here again and hang out too!"}
{"text":"I threw out my boba. I THREW OUT MY BOBA. I guess there's a first time for everything. Their house black milk tea was disappointing, to say the least. My kids weren't crazy about their popcorn chicken either. My son, who up until this point loved all things fried chicken, made it clear to me that their chicken wasn't that good. (I actually thought it tasted ok.) Their chicken banh mi was nothing memorable, and the chicken was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Love coming here whenever I come in town! I have a friend who kept telling me about this place and posting pictures about it and one day decided to give it a try and ever since then, I am hooked! I love their mango mason jar tea. I also got my boyfriend hooked on as well. I haven't tried much but the mason jar teas but I'm sure everything is just as good cause they are always busy when I go in. Definitely give them a try! It's something different."}
{"text":"I've been in Charlotte for 3 weeks after moving from New York. I've been to Tea Fusion 5 times! The avocado Bubble Tea is is 10 out of 5!!"}
{"text":"I cannot express how much of a delight it is to have Tea Fusion a part of my life. Their refreshers are truly refreshing, made from fresh fruit, jellies, and fruit juices. I equally enjoy their hot cider, hot chocolate, and milk teas (almond, coconut, and soy milk available for select items). If you're hungry, you cannot miss the banh-mi sandwiches or popcorn chicken. This is the best spot to get a drink, a snack, and relax with your friends. There are even board games and outlets for customers to use freely. It's mostly frequented by university students but it is a must go-to for anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place i go multiple times a week but the last time i went my mega mango just tasted like water. it wasn't sweet and we just threw it away. we were extremely disappointed. I also paid extra for popping pearls. i didn't get any in my drink. very disappointed lately."}
{"text":"Great customer service! After I had already ordered my drink, they told me there weren't any more tapioca left for my bubble tea so was told to choose an alternative. What I ended up choosing tasted great but they saw the huge disappointment in my face that they ran out of what I wanted so they made a new batch of tapioca and delivered me a brand new drink! 
The ambiance of the place was great also! Lots of sitting space. 
I thought the prices were pretty up there but they do give you a lot and if you think about it, a starbucks drink is even more expensive for what you are actually getting."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews and decided to try it out. There are lots of drink options including milk teas, bubble tea, hot tea, coffee, and other such drinks. I got the fruit refresher drink and it was good, not as good as expected from the reviews though! It kinda tasted like they used sugar substitute if you know what I mean. Not bad, I definitely appreciate the fresh cut fruit in the drink and would defs come back to try other types of drinks!"}
{"text":"Every time I go I've enjoy the service and the beverage. I usually go for the Mangonata."}
{"text":"Tried the strawberry shaved ice cream. My girlfriend and I ate the flavored bubbles that came with the order but the ice cream itself was really unpleasant. We left the entire dish there. Did not try any of the other food. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I loved the Mango refresher .  It was definitely refreshing like it's name.  Never had anything like this before.  My little one year old loved it too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! The staff is awesome. Great atmosphere for alone time or for hanging out with friends. They have a nice selections of teas and other beverages that you can customize.  Other than the mason jar teas, I recommend the butterfly pea tea. It's not so pretty. I haven't had the food because I have allergies and can't eat a majority of what's on the menu. But there's something for everyone. They also have ice cream, that I will try when it gets a little warmer. I wish I lived a closet but glad I don't because they would have ALL of my money."}
{"text":"Super pump to find a nice bubble tea cafe that offers wide variety of tea drinks and Asian style shaved iced!! Love their bubble tea drinks. The green tea shaved ice is very mild. It'd be better with stronger green tea flavor. I voted this place for the best bubble tea in Charlotte areas"}
{"text":"Been looking for a boba place and I think I've found it! The staff is super friendly and the boba is tasty. I ordered the strawberry kiss tea drink and it was a bit too sweet so next time I'll have to ask for less sugar. Other than that, loved it! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a variety to choose from and it's student friendly. I recommend the fried egg banh mi, calamari and all of the vanilla bean bubble tea! Also, the mason jar teas are just perfection. The owner and workers are so nice! That's one of the reasons I absolutely love going there!  The interior is adorable and they have wifi. My study spot when I have a lot of work. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bobba place in Charlotte. They make amazing drinks and have cakes, and Bahn Mi too! They have a wide variety of drinks to choose from including some great fruit drinks in mason jar cups! The location is also really cute and has tables to sit at as well as couches."}
{"text":"This reminds me of Chinatown in Philly this tea shop is excellent to be in Charlotte and have access to a really nice tea shop is pretty darn cool they have bubble tea have a lots of fruit teas that have nice crispy chicken and a great Vietnamese sandwich"}
{"text":"I usually get there drinks from here. I have always loved them. I usually excited when someone talks about going to tea fusion because I love this place so much. I can't wait to go back and get some more."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and every time I've been the service is great. The owner even had a conversation with us when I came with a group of friends. The first time I came here I'd never tried bubble tea and they helped me order and explained some things. I've since had it at other places and none have been better than here. The atmosphere is also very nice, usually quiet enough to do work or have a small get together. They also have have board games available. It's definitely one of my favorite places in the area."}
{"text":"The food, the tea, the decor, ambiance and super chill customer service were outstanding. I had the grilled pork bahn mi and mango tea and it was soooo goood. This will be my new spot to get my bahn mi fix because Le's cafe....it's good, but the location is just a little too sketchy! They had macaroons and a ton of other deserts that I can't wait to try. Overall it's a great place and I shall be back soon!"}
{"text":"Hands freaking down the best boba I ever had .
This $5 drink had actual vanilla bean flecks in it . Perfectly cooked boba and perfectly sweet slush made this one an incredible drink . Excited to try all the other unique drinks they had on the menu"}
{"text":"Simply great drinks and popcorn chicken. We had the passion fruit tea in the mason jar and the taro boba tea. Both were excellent. We just wish they would open a location in South Charlotte! :)"}
{"text":"Bubble tea is amazing. Bubbles are super fresh. The coffee flavored one is great. 

Strawberry bubble tea too sweet for my taste. Green tea cheesecake was bitter. They were out of green tea when I came.

Overall will be back for bubble tea. Student discount is only on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Look at Charlotte stepping up her foodie game! I've been obsessed with milk and fruit teas for YEARS, but have been getting my fix when I visit Atlanta, New York or California. You do not understand the excitement inside me as I write this review! 

Initially, here's a little tea 101. There are 3 different types of teas: Fruit Teas, Milk Teas and Boba Teas. Fruit teas are fruit-infused teas with little bits of fruits and fruit jellys. The boba tea is a slushee and boba are little tapioca pearls. Milk tea is simply a mix of milk and tea :) My favorites are the Passion Fruit Tea with bits of fruits (and I add boba!), the traditional Milk Tea and the Taro Milk Tea (I add grass jelly to both - I understand that sounds weird, but it's delicious!).

I've also tried the Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) and would recommend getting the Fusion Special, Grilled Pork or Lemongrass Chicken. P.S. They also have a couple of vegetarian options (Tofu and Fried Egg) :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I frequent this place a lot and prob would be there more if we lived closer. Their tea refreshers are pretty good with my favorite being their Mango one. 

Don't sleep on their banh mi! They are actually very good and the bread they use is legit. Most people come for the tea but you should go for both. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love their drinks here! I've tried a lot of their drinks and my favorite would be the passion fruit tea. If you don't like it too sweet you can ask them to put less in there. They also have a variety of banh mi which tastes great. My favorite would be the banh mi thit nuong. The owners a very nice and the staff is very friendly. I always come by because it's a great study place."}
{"text":"Great milk tea. Not as sweet as some of the bubble tea places in the states. Def recommended"}
{"text":"Health-conscious should be the title of this review...warmth, courtesy. Panera style, with asian touch sandwiches, cafe, and desserts in a smaller scale.
I enjoy the laid back atmosphere and music...very important especially on a Sunday afternoon.
Very good meat to bread portion size control Sofa seating and all. only if they serve some more side stuff...like calamari or cuttle fish sides...I'm just sayin'"}
{"text":"I guess this is our only option in Charlotte Area. 
Moved from Boston/NYC, the drink quality is not comparable. However I gave them big credits for an Ok drink in this area.
I was about to give 4 star until they put my hot drink in a cheap plastic cup (use for cold drink) as someone who works in the chemical field and a 9 month pregnant mom, I know how much chemicals are releasing from the given temperature. I told the cashier girl straight on just in case they are not aware of the situation, but she seems extremely careless and didn't even bother to tell the drink makers... 
I guess customers health is not their concern. If you order the hot drink next time, do remember ask for the coffee cup..."}
{"text":"There customer service is top notch. As soon as you enter the cafe they greet you warmly. The decor is pretty modern and contemporary. Everything was clean. We only stopped for tea and shaved ice. We enjoyed the mango mason jar tea very much. The taro shaved ice with pearls and jelly was delicious as well. I wish they had one in Greensboro, NC. It sure would thrive. We will stop in again in the future when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Saw a few reviews that said it was a good study spot-I have to agree. Jumped across from campus on a Wednesday afternoon, and the vibe was chill with nice music and a quiet atmosphere. 

I ordered the grilled pork Banh Mi and a \"less sweet\" version of their passion fruit mason jar tea. The sandwich was beautiful with fresh cilantro, jalapeños and carrots. The bread was perfectly warm and soft with a crispy fresh baked crust. The pork, however was pretty tough. I wish I would have gotten a different meat, and probably will next time. The tea was a perfect finisher. Not too sweet, but just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. The fresh fruit was perfect, and who doesn't love crushed ice!? 

I'm happy I stopped here. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family and friends always raved about this tea fusion place. So I finally came to town and checked it out. Definitely worth the hype in regards to the tea. I got the mega mango tea and it was delicious on a hot day! I love all the little jellies and apple pieces in my tea. To me it's definitely the lychee jellies that make the tea awesome. I also tried their grilled pork banh mi but sadly it's not the bomb. I've had better elsewhere. Not only that, they do not put alot of meat in there. They were definitely being cheap about that, however, the meat honestly tasted good and well marinated. The picked carrots and daikon didn't even have a pickled taste. That was disappointing because I do like the pickled taste in a banh mi. 

Also, I did get a green milk tea to go with boba. That was disappointing. It wasn't sweet enough. At least the boba was delicious? If I'm in town again, I will get some more flavored teas but not the banh mis."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their bubble tea is out of this world 100% recommended. They gave our group a free shaved ice, the owner expressed his feelings to cheer us up after Hurricane Irma hit our homes in Florida. We are very grateful! Give these guys your business!"}
{"text":"Loved the Passion Fruit Lemonade, Pineapple Paradise, Taro Bubble Tea, Green Bubble Tea, Thai Tea && Mango Bubble Tea. The popcorn chicken snack bites were great for munchies!"}
{"text":"I got avocado  bubble tea from this place and I didn't like it because it taste like powder and cream. I went back to the cash register and  explained very politely that I don't like this drink. Can you please make some something else instead? She replied back saying that, we do not exchange drinks with no apologizes. I guess they don't care about customer satisfaction, over priced drinks with no customer service skills. I definitely will not be returning here"}
{"text":"Excellent place to lounge or place for a date. Great choices for drinks and mini go-to bites"}
{"text":"Finally a bubble tea/ boba place that uses fresh fruit, fresh made tea, fresh boba and has milk tea. So sick of the gross quicklys. This reminds me of California. 

Can't wait till more tea shops open to give nc more variety of places to go to. 

Strawberry kiss was great, calamari very fresh"}
{"text":"I like this place and I would recommend this for a friend but the past two day coming to the cafe for lunch. They haven't been toasting my bahn mi and having ask if I'm want any of the vegetables in or not. My bahn mi have been cold and not toasted..."}
{"text":"I stopped in my tracks, staring at the large sign in front of me, shining like a giant beacon, beckoning me to come closer.

I couldn't believe it.

Is it real? Do my eyes deceive me? IS THAT BOBA? In North Carolina??? 

Without a second to waste, I dragged my coworker like a rag doll inside the brightly lit parlor that was decorated with velvet couches, plushy chairs, twinkling lights, and large, decorative lamps hanging from above. With contemporary music blasting through the sound system, it was almost as if I was back in the Bay Area on a typical boba run with my darling hubby.

The black menu showcased various fruit teas, bubble teas (smoothies), milk teas, and hot drinks. My eyes, however, instantly locked on the milk tea section, spotting my favorite, green milk tea. I eagerly ordered that with grass jelly while my coworker got a strawberry bubble tea with pearls. 

But my eagerness faltered just a bit when I caught a glance of my boba that was...green?

I don't remember green milk tea being green (ironic, now that I think about it). I hesitantly popped the lid and took a small sip before the familiar taste of matcha hit my tongue. While I understand why this would be called green milk tea, I can't say that I didn't feel somewhat tricked...It wasn't the drink I was expecting at all.

That's not to say I'm not a fan of matcha. I most certainly do like the flavor, but Tea Fusion Cafe made the drink a bit too powdery. I didn't like the chalky aftertaste hanging around on my tongue. However, I did like how they used crushed ice and that the grass jelly was silky, even though the pieces all floated to the top.

I was alarmed that in terms of prices, Tea Fusion Cafe closely matched those in the Bay Area. I thought California was always going to be more expensive when compared to North Carolina, but clearly that isn't always the case. Perhaps the lack of demand raises the price?

When it comes to boba, though, I don't think there are a lot of states that can compete with the plethora of choices in California, but to see that Charlotte had at least one was a pleasant surprise. It may not have been perfect, but it was good enough for me to finish the cup with a smile."}
{"text":"What a great place! 
This is a huge tea shop. We came just for the bubble tea. We got three different flavors. The honeydew melon bubble tea was the best! 
The prices are a bit steep, but they do come in a generous size cup. And what bubble tea would not be complete without a funky big straw? They definitely have those. Lots of different colors to choose from. Kids love these.
Parking can be a challenge, especially on a busy shopping weekend.
The staff was friendly and helpful and polite. We will definitely be back when we are in the mood for a bubble tea."}
{"text":"Newly opened we stopped in after getting a glimpse of the pastry display. My husband tried the \"cafe su da\" which is an espresso based coffee drink with condensed milk. He is a coffee snob and he was impressed. I had the \"wild berry fusion\" which is a berry tea iced with bits of tapioca, apples , and berries. We also tried the macaroons and danishes. My husband's was a bit dry, but not surprising considering we stopped in at the end of the day. Can't wait to come back and try their bubble tea and cheesecakes."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now. Mainly to just stop in and order something to go. Their menu is big and there is something for everyone and that specific craving. Sweet and savory. They offer almond milk as a substitute for regular cow milk for their bubble tea. #winning. You couldn't tell the difference in texture or flavor. They also allow you to mix flavors so I went with taro and coconut mix. Perfect combination. They have special menu items only available on the weekends such as their tofu pudding and vegetarian/tofu banh mi. They don't skimp on their veggie/tofu banh mi. It's about a foot long and every bite is full of tofu and veggies. No dry bread. Definitely a go-to spot if you're in the area. Prices are fair and service is friendly."}
{"text":"love love the mason jar drinks n the bubble teas!!! desserts are great!! atmosphere is awesome,nice place to hang out n chit chat!!!"}
{"text":"Coconut Bubble Tea was so good!! Seriously was so sad when I finished it. The staff was incredibly helpful explaining to me the differences in the drinks and directing me to the one I wanted. Delicious and I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Home sweet home. This is the one boba place in Charlotte that's close to what I'm used to in California."}
{"text":"It's a great little cafe. I just would not order the Taro milk tea drink as it is very powdery almost like a protein shake and wasn't good at all. I'd recommend getting the mango drinks and refreshers. We got the coconut snow cream as well and it was alright. Some things are very overpriced but I guess for the atmosphere and the area it's alright. The staff is very kind. :)"}
{"text":"I love the house milk tea with coffee jelly! Best milk tea I ever had. I love the decor and the dessert they have is beautifully presented."}
{"text":"My first time trying a bahn mi from anywhere and it was delicious! 

This place is amazing, great customer service, and really good variety of tea options. 

I ordered the lemon grass chicken bahn mi and lychee tea with passion fruit jellies and both tasted great. Just be aware that there are fresh jalapeños on the sandwiches so if you don't like spicy i advise to ask for it without the peppers."}
{"text":"I love the fusion tea and the bubble tea!!! They have free WI-FI. A nice place that your friend and ok can go to have girl talk. And quite enough that you can do homework, reading and all type of work. The staff to super helpful."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, decent prices and delicious bubble tea. I tried the Thai milk tea with added boba bubbles and it was great. Good flavor and just sweet enough. The owner and staff was very friendly and nice. Amazing place!"}
{"text":"Went with my mother who's vegan and we got the Lemongrass Tofu Banh Mí and Fried Tofu.

The Banh Mí was perfectly toasted, full of crisp carrots, cilantro and well seasoned tofu. The fried tofu was golden and crisp in the outside and soft in the inside. With the Thai Chili Sauces and Sriracha in the restaurant one can heighten the spice as desired. 

Had a great time and will definetly be back, oh and she got a passion fruit tea with chia and boba and I got the Thai tea with boba, both were awesome as well."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were a bit different for my taste but the pineapple bubble tea with Lychee was amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome Boba and Milk Tea. Relaxing atmosphere with boardgames and a lot of space to hang put and enjoy a good baked goodie. My go to spot in the University area!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte my whole life and the boba here, from the Asian superstores or malls, have been sugar filled mediocrities at best. Tea Fusion Cafe is different in that it gives you more variety and better quality tea for the same price you would pay for your typical boba. The other menu options are also great as well. I would definitely recommend the items I got, which were a very aesthetically pleasing Mango mason jar tea along with some Taiwanese popcorn chicken that had an amazing flavor and crunch. The cafe had a very relaxed and homelike vibe to it, with futons and games lying around, and it felt like I was hanging out in a lounge. I found that there were a lot of college students when I went, which is probably due to the cafe's close proximity to UNCC. I would definitely recommend this place as a nice place to hangout with friends for lunch or spot to grab some treats with the family!"}
{"text":"Amazing tea, ridiculous portions, wonderful atmosphere and incredibly charming staff. I got their passion fruit tea, and absolutely savored every sip. Don't forget to order some Taiwanese nuggets. You will NOT be disappointed. Guilty of going here two days in a row."}
{"text":"So excited to have been introduced to this place! On my first visit I got the mega mango tea. This tea has a green tea base and little bits of mango in it. It was so good I decided to go back a week later.

The next time I ordered the avocado bubble tea, just as good as the mega mango tea! I also ordered the bahn mi and Korean BBQ sandwiches to go. I forgot to mention no mayo and instead of saying tough luck they kindly re-made me another sandwich. So nice!!! And the Korean BBQ was absolutely amazing, well worth the money! 

This place is a gem and I will definitely be coming back. Everything is so incredible on the menu and the customer service is exceptional!"}
{"text":"There's everything to love & everyone is incredible! Banh mi - I love theirs! I think the \"smear\" I don't what to call it,  a form of mayo but not mayo taste different from other places.  It's strong enough to be distinctive but it's not too much,  & personally that's one of the main things I like about a banh mi. It may look like a simple sub but to get it right, there's almost a science to it.  And you don't have to figure it out bc here they did it for you so go for it! The classic is great but the unique options they offer are not to be passed up! 
The teas! Just delicious. They're all good but winter melon is my favorite.  Along with their beautiful fruit infused teas with delicious mix of toppings,  they even offer coffee to pistachio frappe to the delicious & beautiful mangoritas wide range of goodies for suuuuure! Open as late as 11, big surprise & a plus! But don't keep them any later  than that please! It's just a good to know bc sometimes I'm off late & appreciate that this is an option."}
{"text":"If you get beaten up here, it's Tea Bruiseon Cafe. You may even end up with a Tea Contusion Cafe. But if you imagined the whole thing don't worry, that's because you're at Tea Illusion Cafe. Now please stop hitting on the servers, otherwise I'll have to rename it Tea Putting-the-moves-on Cafe.

What to get: The Pineapple Special Drink they recommend
What else: If your Mac computer tells you it's 3.14, that's Pi on Apple.

I don't want to cause Con Fusion, but I have to say that despite all my semi positive Bubble Tea reviews in North Carolina, that NC doesn't really have good bubble tea. Not compared to what I am used to.

However Tea Fusion is as close as it gets. The decor is wonderful, the girls serving here are extremely friendly, happy, and if they were single you'd want to date them. I don't actually know if they're single, I'm just trying to put you off from trying to date them in case they actually are.

I ended up ordering 3 drinks here (typical me) because they kept recommending different things. It was easily my most fun experience in Charlotte, although I'll be in town again tomorrow so maybe I'll find something even more fun. So to speak.

The regular milk tea and other milk teas are good, but the Pineapple special drink that they rave about (with all the crazy bits in it) is by far the star of the show. It's a little sweet, but I enjoyed it and it refreshed me like a wet kipper to the face back in old bonnie wee Scotland me lassie.

Aye."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness..I've been missing out!I've had plenty of Bahn Mi sandwiches but the pork Bahn Mi here has a unique taste.It was so fresh and satisfying.I ordered a specialty drink too which was very good.I've already been back again!"}
{"text":"Went there for a quick lunch and ordered a Bahn Mi and a coconut tea.
The sandwich was good and tasting good, the tea was a little blend and not much flavor. 
The place inside is not very big but is cozy. Has a couple of seats and a couch where ppl can hangout .
It's a good place overall"}
{"text":"Very rude. I ordered the wrong tea and they were very rude giving me another drink. They didn't even give me my money back. Not going again."}
{"text":"Bland ordered taro milk tea with boba ...... tasted like milk with taro powder added to it should've went to quickly"}
{"text":"I think I found where all of the cool kids hang out during the day or at least that's what it felt like when I decided to work there for a couple of hours one day last month.

I was on my way home from a mid-day appointment and figured it would be the perfect time to finally pop into Tea Fusion. It's located right off of WT Harris, in the Total Wine shopping center right across from the hospital and library. 

I arrived around 2:30/3:00 and a steady stream of people followed. Thanks to reading up on the place beforehand, I knew I already wanted a bubble tea (when in Rome, amiright?). I ended up ordering an avocado bubble tea since they were out of the taro flavor when I visited. They have a brightly lit menu board and will explain any menu items should you have questions. I witnessed the employees do this for a couple of people.

While I set up my laptop, one of the kind employees informed me that the wifi password was available on my receipt. A few moments later, my bubble tea was ready and I excitedly took a hearty sip. I will say, you will find out if you fall into one of two camps: those who like the taste of the boba pearls  and those who don't. I happen to be in the former group and will look forward to trying all of the flavors they offer.

While I worked and sipped my tea, the place really got busy. There a was long line for quite a while and the tables filled up around me. The crowd was very youthful and most seemed to be regulars. I saw plenty of people ordering the shaved ice cream and those pretty mason jar drinks.

There is so much I look forward to trying and am thankful to have another place to bring my more adventurous out-of-town friends."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good hangout spot, this is it! Good snack type foods and amazing drinks! I ordered the coconut boba tea and popcorn chicken. The coconut boba tea didn't have the artificial coconut flavor, it tasted fresh. The popcorn chicken was something I had never tasted before. It was sweet and so good! Highly recommend. My boyfriend ordered their pineapple paradise and loved it. It's just a bonus that it's totally instagram-able."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out  their mason tea jar refreshers are the best  having 20% grand opening for drinks! Definitely  will try all the drinks they have"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! The managers/owners here are literally the sweetest people ever! I remember when they first open I would see them behind the counters a lot, but not much since then this place got pretty popular(I mean how could it not). They would always greet you with a smile every time you walk in & greet you when you walk out! I would literally come here every weekend for their refreshing drinks or boba, but they added A LOTTA things to their menu since. I always have such a struggle choosing what I want from their menu because there's too much!! (Annnd all they're missing is a rose milk tea *hint *hint (; LOL) I recommend trying their passion fruit tea, omg it's literally so friggin refreshing and good. & ITS SO PRETTY! The decor is also so lovely, it's a really cute hangout spot so bring your friends!!"}
{"text":"NEW FAV SPOT IN CHARLOTTE! I was casually looking for a place to get coffee and stumbled upon this one. I actually got Red Bean bubble tea and it was amazing! This place is only 3 months old and the owners boyfriend actually sat down and asked us for our opinions. Def a must if you are in Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"You really only get one chance to make a first impression and unfortunately they blew it. When you think of Boba Tea, Taro is among the most popular flavor. Well they didn't have any and according to the friendly young lady if we returned in a week or two they'd have it. 

We decided to try other flavors and were disappointed. Their strawberry taste like powdered strawberry quik, and their coconut just doesn't seem real.  It's a huge Smoothie and the tapioca pearls are soft and chewy but they have much to improve, beginning with having TARO in stock."}
{"text":"The mason jar teas are absolutely delicious as that's what my wife ordered and it floored us both at the taste. I got a Thai milk tea with lychee jellies and it was absolutely hands down the best I've had! 

Prices are decent and the tea tastes amazing. Service was quick and friendly. Will be returning. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for ONE drink. I ordered a mango drink and they gave it to some lady, when I went after thirty minutes to ask about my drink I was given a sorry half apology and told to wait five minutes. I should've just left."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in 2 weeks.. so happy we finally have the first real tea place in Charlotte area. Thai tea is better than the house milk tea in my opinion. The shaved ice,  popcorn chicken, sandwich, and the tapioca were all pretty good. Didn't care for the cheese cake tho. Pretty nice,  relaxed, casual place to get a lit snack and hang out. Would go more often if it's in south Charlotte."}
{"text":"Cool joint...I stopped in for a few and had the Oreo bubble tea. It pretty much tastes like a milkshake, but I liked it. Adding boba to the tea is optional so I tried it, but when I accidentally ate one I didn't like the texture! The only thing I suggest is different size opts for the drinks. It seemed what I ordered only came in one size and it was a bit much. Other than that I really like the  casual atmosphere and various seating opts. I look forward to trying some of their food items."}
{"text":"I really liked the mega mango! I wasn't sure how much I would like flavored tea but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved the drink. The staff was friendly and quick. I got my order to go, as I was pretty busy that day. But I would like to dine in the next time I go. It was very clean and had a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've only tried the drinks here, and they are GOOD. I had a classic black milk tea with coffee jelly and it was perfect. No complaints. I also like how they use crushed ice so I didn't have to dig around ice cubes to get to my jelly.

Husband got the mangonada and he loved it. It was made just as it should be--with the straw covered in the sour candy thing. (I have no idea what it's called but if you like mangonadas, you'll know what I'm talking about).

The service was great, and we didn't have to wait long for our orders. There were other patrons in the shop on their laptops studying, etc. So it seems like a good place to chill and get work done."}
{"text":"Amazing place with great food and drinks.  Their bubble tea is absolutely amazing. Great sandwiches and fries. 

The ambiance is nice. They have table games like jenga

Priced reasonably. And great people."}
{"text":"A very nice place with very friendly people work there. Popcorn chicken is very good!"}
{"text":"I go like 4x a week I love this place so much . They have the best drinks in CLT.  They are fast and have great customer service."}
{"text":"Nice spacious restaurant inside with plenty of room to dine and lounge.  There was a great selection of music playing from recognizable smooth jazz and electronic artist.  I found that refreshing than to hear mainstream music.  I came in specifically for the mason jar drinks.  I ordered the peach perfection. I gave in and tried a sandwich.  I ordered the grill pork.  I had a feeling it would taste like pho in a sandwich.  It was tasty.  I enjoyed the chili sauce from the condiment bar.  The drink was lightly sweet but the lychee at the bottom made the drink much better.  I had no idea lychee was that good before.  I will return for the shaved ice with lychee especially.  The service was nice and helpful.  Very clean inside.  This is good for lunch or something light."}
{"text":"Their mason jar teas are awesome.

Got a taro bubble tea and it did not disappoint!

Sandwiches are very good. Sweet potato fries are a great deal, not oily at all, very well done."}
{"text":"Great location, service, and people! We came in a group of 7 and everyone was happy with there drink. We tried their popcorn chicken, calamari and macaron and were very pleased! Grand opening week special of 20% off!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the yelpers I have found this place. I have tasted so many bubble teas in Charlotte and none of them can match Tea Fusion. The bubble tea at Tea Fusion is the real deal. I got the taro bubble tea and it was so darn good. I got the passion fruit tea for mom but she still likes the taro bubble tea better. The portion size of its tea is not stingy. You get a good portion. Please give this place a try."}
{"text":"The teas are so bomb! I used to live in downtown LA, CA, and ever since I moved here I've been looking for cafes and shops similar to back home. This has that chic, cool kid vibe with great teas and some pretty yummy banh mi. They aren't the best banh mi, but good if you're too hungry to go to banh mi brothers or Lee's."}
{"text":"Considering I'm the hubby in Cecilia C.'s review (follow her), I won't bore you good people with a play-by-play of the two wonderful visits we both had at this establishment. Jimmy, the owner, clearly cares about the quality of the food, drink, and experiences you have when you step through the door. The snacks are wonderful, the desserts delicious, and those \"mason jar refreshers\" ALONE are worth the trip. The Cafe is fairly new and the menu is slowly growing. There's not enough places like this in Charlotte. Vote with your dollars people! Don't walk, RUN to Tea Fusion Cafe. You won't regret it ;)"}
{"text":"My first time trying this I didn't know what to expect..it was very clean, quick, and delicous! I didn't know what to order..so I got a #1 the wild berry fusion and fell in love with it :-)"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for the mason jar drinks here. I think they are a bit pricy but they make up for it in taste. I have only had drinks so I'm not sure about the food but it looks yummy!"}
{"text":"So I ended up here heading to Golden Krust unaware that they have closed down. I looked over the menu and just settled on a Bubble Tea, which I've never had before, but the lady in front is me was raving about it, so her why not! It looked yummy,  but ummmm, this is not my cup of tea. The service was superb, but yeah I'll have to try something different, if there is a next time or leave the boca balls out. I will not take a star off because of my personal preference because overall nice place and lovely people."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place I've been to for bubble tea they have amazing everything and i can't begin to put it into words I've been to most of the bubble tea places on the east coast and this is always going to be my favorite place ever i love this place so much it's the cozyest spot they have nice seating they have a chest full of games just phenomenal drinks and snacks and their cheese cake is amazing all their desserts are so great my fave cheese cake is the green tea one ok I'm done just try it and u won't regret jt"}
{"text":"WOW! Such a great first impression! Parking is ample. Place is full of windows. Lots of tables and chairs. A couple of classy couches and classy cushioned chairs paired with low living room style tables complete with flowers and a burning candle. Decor is modern and bright. Piped in music was popular modern style, but not isolating. Staff were very very genuine and helpful and friendly. Bathroom was gender specific and very clean and roomy. 

The menus selection was staggering. So much stuff! I went with the Cafe Sua Da which is an iced Vietnamese coffee. Basically strong dark coffee mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I thought the price at $4.50 was pretty fair. Seemed like the disposable cup was just over 8 ounces or so. I liked that the ice was pellet style. Coffee was excellent! They had a humble amount of desserts in their cooler. I chose the tiramisu. The taste was subtle, definitely scratch made and of good flavor. I think it paired well with the sweetness of my coffee. 

I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Overall the food is good here. My fav drinks are mega mango, mangonata, winter melon. Their ice cream is not delucious at all, i love green tea but i wasn't inpressed with the green tea ice cream. As for the banh mi i love the korean bbq kimchi."}
{"text":"Tea Fusion is delicious! I've had bubble tea and their jar teas and they're all amazing. The service is great and the employees are very nice. I also tried their shaved ice cream.... 2 thumbs up for that, it's outstanding. Be prepared to at least order 2 items off their menu because everything is so good. I've tried their green tea bubble tea, mango bubble tea, passion fruit jar tea, strawberry jar tea, a few others, and shaved ice cream. This is a great addition to the University Area!"}
{"text":"Ban mi was ok. I had the chicken. Bubble teas were expensive and ok. My son had the Oreo tea which he loved. I had the mango which tasted very fake and powdery. My husband had Vietnamese coffee which he loved."}
{"text":"Service is great and friendly. We come here once a week to get drinks. I love the mangonada. I've also tried the strawberry tea with lychee which is very good."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by this place. You can tell that it's run really well!

First I wanted to say that it was late at night so we called to ask what time they closed. Girl on the other end of line was super sweet and even told us \"you have a good one\" before saying bye and hanging up. When was the last time you've called a business to ask questions and they did that? Not counting businesses where their calls are monitored and recorded??

Really cute spot. Small and cozy but plenty of seating and because it was a corner unit with lots of windows, it felt really open. 

Order their Banh Mi Dac Biet, Korean BBQ Banh Mi, Avacodo Bubble Tea and Mangonada. 

Their bread is perfect. And I mean it. Picking it up I thought that it would be too hard and dry. But biting into it was perfect. No resistant. No excessive crunch. No crumbling from being too dry. No chewiness from either being too \"meaty\" or use of microwave. Really, based on my opinion this is the PERFECT bread. It is not a 100% of a Vietnamese baguette, BUT, it is perfect for a Banh Mi. 

The Dac Biet was very good!! Top 3 of every Banh Mi Dac Biet I've eaten (I was born and raised in OC California)... but, their Korean BBQ Banh Mi wasn't good. Tasted nothing like Korean BBQ, and it was way too salty. 

The avocado bubble tea I got was nearly perfect! Jus the boba was on the harder side, but everything else was absolutely wonderfully. I loved it!!

Mangonada was a bit too sweet. If the avocado bubble tea was a 5 (being perfect), the Mangonada was a 15+ (way out of the ballpark) because it was literally at least 3 times as sweet. 

Regardless, I really enjoyed my visit here. They draw quite a crowd so they definitely know what they're doing. My opinion is merely based on the fact that I was around when these kind of shops first popped up in CA some 20+ years ago, and it's just a opinion... this is better than 90% of tea/boba/Banh mi shops that's around anywhere! That's why they get a 5 star from me."}
{"text":"I tried their bahn mi, and like the way they toasted the bread. I think I will visit this cafe a lot!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love their different varieties of drinks my favorite drinks would probably be the mason jar refreshers. I would definitely recommend the cafe sua da for coffee lovers and the tuxedo cake is to die for! Banh mi is also good too if you're wanting something light to eat."}
{"text":"I would definitely be coming back when ever I'm in Charlotte. Nice cafe shop to sit and chill at."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My fiancé and I are moving in 2 days and so sad that we just decided to go here! The green tea bubble tea was the best I've ever had and this passion fruit tea was amazing! So good!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting Tea Fusion I tried the KumQuat tee. Delicious!!!! It has a orange & lime citrus flavor. It was so refreshing I came back the following day & ordered a Lychee Tea & Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef sandwich). The sandwich was light & refreshing. I sat at a window seat, ate & people watched. 

This is definitely a nice place to visit if you want a light bite to eat."}
{"text":"I come to tea fusion for their drink selections. I haven't had any food menu items because I usually go after eating at Crackin' Crawfish. Their drinks are refreshing and service is fairly quick. I got their mason tea jar drink and my daughter got the shaved ice cream. She really enjoyed the mocha topping. I love the mix of fresh fruit and yummy jellies in my drinks."}
{"text":"A nice little tea shop. It's very laid back and relaxed. Nice snacks and delicious tea. If you're looking for a place to chill or wrote a paper and love tea, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I got the Lemongrass Chicken Banh Mi and a Large Mango Tropical Fresh Tea! 10/10 would come back! Very clean and chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just found out about this place from my older sister (who I went with today) 
Walking in its very calm and relaxing. Decor gives off an Asian style/lounge. I really enjoyed the huge menu board they had and display of desserts. 
Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. 
Bathrooms were clean, and the cafe itself was family friendly. 

I ordered the mega mango mason jar refresher. It was definitely delicious and presented so beautifully. (See pictures) 
We also ordered the popcorn chicken, which I highly recommend you try and the desserts are an A ++
(The gentlemen -- who I believe who was the owner even offered advice for my child's eczema issue -- which I greatly appreciated.) 
I definitely believe this spot is a hot spot to enjoy some delicious finger foods and flavorful teas."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The drinks and food were so yummy I don't even know where to begin. The mangonada and the kumquat tea are hands down the best drinks there and my favorite appetizer is the popcorn chicken. Don't get me wrong, the other appetizer and drinks are perfect. It's a great place to study and socialize. If only this place exist in South Charlotte, I'd be all over this place. 

I haven't had everything on the list, but here's a few great things to get:

Mason Tea Jar Refresher -
Strawberry Kiss
Orange Voodoo

Tropical Fresh Tea - 
KumQuat Tea

Finger Food - 
Popcorn Chicken
Sweet Potato Fries
Steam Edamame

Shaved Ice Cream - 
Taro

Banh Mi (Sandwiches)
- Grilled Pork (Thit Nuong)
- (Dac Biet)
- (Cha Lua)"}
{"text":"Visited this cafe and ordered Banh mi cha lua, tiramisu, mango and passionfruit mason jar refresher. The shop is in a plaza on a corner and probably seats around 40-50 people. It's a very relaxed and chill environment. You order at the front and can find a seat to wait for your order number to be called. Prices are reasonable to me, especially being in the Charlotte area. The mango and passionfruit refreshers were amazing! They came out both looking the exact same in color, but taste very different. Each tea has cut-up fruit, chia seeds, and jelly inside. The Banh mi was also delicious and the tiramisu was one of the most authentic tiramisu's I've had (wasn't expecting that at all). If you're into trying fun Asian teas or want a low key place to hang out and eat some Banh mi or finger foods, check out Tea Fusion!"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly place. Service is great as always. My son enjoys the Thai tea and chicken tenders with ranch."}
{"text":"Where to begin??? This place is honestly AMAZING! You literally can not go wrong ordering anything off their menu, from drinks to food to desserts! All are mouthwatering and all taste incredible.
This is the new hotspot in the University Area for bubble tea and it'll continue to be, no doubt because the owners are unbelievably sweet and accommodating. The moment you walk in the door they automatically treat you like family! They keep the Area full of college students and budgets in mind with their prices....  It doesn't hurt that I have nothing bad to say about their food either! ;)
My family and I ordered:
Popcorn chicken.... YUM! Each piece of chicken is bitesize and very tender with this awesome seasoning on it! #fingerlickingood ! 
Fried oysters .... They definitely do not skimp on the oysters and the batter is nice and flaky.
Fried calamari.... So much of it, goes amazingly well with the sauce that comes with it.
Fried fishballs... holy cannoli these were scrumptious!!!!!!!!! Think..... Crab cake meets tofu texture! Plus the sauce they drizzle on it!!!??? To die for!!
We ordered 3 different teas.... We slurped them down so fast I wish I could breakdown the taste for you.... 
Do not miss out on this place.... You'll regret it! Thank you tea fusion for existing in my life!"}
{"text":"What a fun little place! They have a bunch of different teas, cold or hot, coffees, boba teas, desserts and appetizers. It's been a long time since we had little shops around that focused more on teas than coffees. We tried the passion fruit tea and the coconut boba tea. Both were delicious! 
The inside of the shop is really clean and well laid out with a couple couches in one corner. They also have a few board games. It's the perfect place to hang out with friends, do homework, or just kick back with a book.
They also have a lot of tea gift sets. Seriously, go give this place a try. It is my best find in the area."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place after reading Nikki's review and kept meaning to make it over here. Now that I've tried their bubble tea, I shouldn't have waited so long.  I wanted a smoothie and asked for a suggestion. The cashier suggested Taro, which didn't seem like my scene and then Avocado. I went with Avocado which is not up on the board but ask for it. So good! My drink was smooth and creamy with tiny ice crystals from being blended. Mmm. I noticed some of the other reviews says the prices are high but my drink was big. It took me a while to finish it and it was very filling. I'll be back to try other flavors, for sure!"}
{"text":"Decided to try the place because the foot traffic was nonstop. So I figured it had to be good! The atmosphere was so friendly & welcoming. The place was clean & super cute! But was super cute was the drinks! It taste as good as it looks maybe even better! :) I will definitely be coming back with plenty of friends & family."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite place! Everything is delicious here. The environment is very cozy and clean. The owner is very friendly and makes all customers feel welcome, which is a rare sight these days. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"If I lived in the University area, this would be my office every single damn day. Great, now I have to start making up excuses to drive up here. I can see it now- \"Yes, I would love to have our meeting uptown by your office, but wouldn't it be more fun to drive to University and drink bubble tea?!\"

I fell in love from the moment we walked through the door. I love the big, white flowery looking light fixture. Morgan F and I each got one of the mason tea jars (mega mango and wild berry fusion), some edamame, and a banh mi. All of the mason tea jars have fresh diced fruits, chia seeds, and jelly (of some sort). On top of a huge seleciotn of teas and bubble teas, they also have Vietnamese coffee, French press, and fruit slushies. They also have a snack type menu, banh mi sandwiches, and a dessert case. I restrained myself from getting green tea cheesecake. 

Free wi-fi. Clean. Cute little flowers on the tables. I saw a couple people playing board games. So, what really put this place over the top for me? Customer service. He helped us order and explained menu items. When we were leaving, we both still had drinks left. We were about to leave them behind, when he came up to offer making them to go cups. Sealed, new straw, and everything."}
{"text":"Charlotte's boba tea scene has been completely transformed. I first savored this sweet delicious drink in Michigan almost 20 years ago and realized how far behind Charlotte was. Whenever I was in Atlanta, I'd stop to get boba tea from the Asian venues because they could not be found back home. Over time, many Asian establishments started carrying their version of boba tea but the taste was always lacking. There was always something missing. 
Welcome to the opening of Tea Fusion. Not only was I amazed from my first order of mango tea refresher, but I've become an even bigger fan after every visit and order since. This place is consistently amazing. Every drink, every banh mi, every choice is delicious. The sandwiches are filled with meat and topped with the most scrumptious and tangy pickled carrots. The drinks are the perfect balance of sweetness, tang, and fruit. The refreshers put Starbucks and Panera to shame. Pick your poison. They are all outstanding. 
There's a sign at the register that tells you up front they do not offer refunds because they stand behind all of their products. I stand with them in this sentiment. If you don't like what you've ordered, it's not because they didn't do It well, it's because you have bad tastebuds. It's ok if you don't believe me. The hundreds of patrons who frequent this place proves you're wrong if you disagree."}
{"text":"I came to visit this place as I am a big fan of Bubble and non-Bubble tea, which can both be ordered here.  When I first walked in I was immediately impressed by the ambiance, and as I got to the counter, the warm, welcoming greetings from the employees intensified my impression.  The waitress that assisted me was very friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu items offered.  It was recommended that I try the Taro Bubble tea, as I have not had it before. I ordered the Taro Bubble tea, calamari, and edamame, which all were very delicious!  In addition to the ambiance, great menu, and friendly staff, board games are also available for you to enjoy, along with plush couch seating.  If you are interested in a nice, laid-back outing to enjoy, please give this place a try!  

NOTE: Do not coming looking for meals, as only finger foods and some tasty looking desserts are available for consumption."}
{"text":"Super cute place with tons of options. I think had I tried another option, I would have given it a higher rating, but I just didn't love the smoothie I got (strawberry mango). The boba, however, was very good...I'd try a different drink next time."}
{"text":"I am a huge boba tea fan and this place hit the spot! They had lots of fresh tea flavors and the boba were very fresh. Additionally, they had lots of food options to include the delicious Banh Mi and fried tofu I had when I went there. The prices were fair for the quality you get here and pretty consistent to most boba tea places. This place is a great asset for the local college students at UNCC or anyone in the University area of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"My new addiction! So good the jar teas are the best. Mango madness and Strawberry Kiss are my faves.  I usually don't like the additions(jellies, bubbles, etc) but I really like their jellies. They have a taste and texture that almost can be confused for the real fruit and tastes awesome.  I tried the popcorn chicken- and they lose star - wasn't very good and was heavily breaded compared to similar products at other similar places.  Been twice in the same day so they can be addictive-drinks cost between 4-5 so not a cheap drink addiction."}
{"text":"Fun chill place to go.  We both ordered the mason jar teas.  Very filling and refreshing.  

This place is near Ashley furniture. The Venue also offers finger foods, hot teas, shaved ice cream and coffee to name a few.  

There is also a case with desserts. 

Met the manager jimmy.  Nice guy and personable.  

Open till 10 pm."}
{"text":"This place is great! This is a nice place to go hang out with someone and have a tea or dessert. They also have free Wi-Fi and a decent number of tables, so you can work if you are looking for a change of pace from the traditional coffee shop vibe. The tea is delicious; I recommend the passion fruit tea in a mason jar. The shaved ice cream is also very good. I wish you could get fresh fruit toppings on the ice cream, but the jellies and pops are still good. The bahn mi is ok, but the tea and dessert is really what it's about here."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and HAD to give it a try because I hadn't had bubble tea in years!! This place did NOT disappoint! The cafe is clean and inviting. The decor makes you want to come and stay a while. A few people were studying and a couple of guys were playing jenga! It's like a hang out spot with great menu options!! I ordered the mango bubble tea and was WOWED!! It was so good that my husband and son both loved it too! I will definitely be going back for a great bubble tea and have plans to bring a friend so we can hang out for a bit."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food, but the mason jar teas are out of this world! I had the mega mango to-go and it was fruity and refreshing. For the quality and size of the tea, I felt that the price was fair. Definitely not an everyday stop but a perfect summer treat that's not ice cream."}
{"text":"Their matcha green tea cheesecake is okay. Definitely not fresh. But if you like green tea as much as me, then you wouldn't like it. I wanted to try it so badly, and got it... But I could tell it wasn't fresh at all. Their matcha green tea milk tea is good. Also their honeydew drink. Their macarons are good, the pistachio one. The chocolate one is too sweet. But good also. Overall, their cute mason jar drinks steals it all."}
{"text":"The Banh Mi sandwiches, shaved ice and their teas are all great. Im giving them 4 stars because of the bubble teas, they had no flavor like other places."}
{"text":"Really fantastic teas and Bahn Mi. They have unique items on the menu that other bubble tea places don't have like kumquat which was awesome. The owner Jimmy is very nice and personable also . I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day and got a strawberry refresher.  I really didn't like it, just to honest.  I expected something different maybe?? I don't know.  It was watery...the fruit pieces were gross, there was some type of jellies in it...but I'm just at a loss.  I thought it would be sweet and fruity and flavorful with big pieces of fresh, real fruit...no. 

The staff was nice. I would come back to maybe try something different one day...but that refresher is NOT where it's at."}
{"text":"My first experience at tea fusion was great. The food tasted good, fast service, and the staff were all friendly. I tried the strawberry tea, popcorn shrimp, and fried oysters. The only downside was the finger food portion."}
{"text":"Probably the best milk tea/ drink spot in Charlotte. The banh mi is pretty good as well. I usually order the original milk tea or taro. The manganada is bangin as well. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the university area"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Los Angeles, boba is everywhere, and I have to say this place knows what it's doing. Boba tea houses are places I always search for when I'm somewhere new, and I accidentally stumbled upon this place. Before going in, my husband and I saw that it had a 5 star rating so we decided to try it. Definitely lives up to the rating expectations. In addition to a few of the milk tea drinks and frozen bubble teas, we got a bulgogi sandwich, which is something we have never had before, and that was the most tender and marinated bulgogi I've ever tasted. If you are looking for a place to hang out to kill time for a little or just chat with friends, this is the place to be. The seating area inside is very clean and open, they have a couple of couches if you want to sit a little more comfortably. I am just visiting the Charlotte area for the weekend, but I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Bravo Tea Fusion Cafe!! You have created the perfect mix of delicious drinks, prime location and inviting atmosphere. I stumbled upon this spot during their soft opening and was very pleased with the experience. We got the Wild Berry Fusion (which came in a mason jar) they did not skip on any berries. We also got the kumquat tea and added lychee jelly. They have 6 different jellies to choose from. They also have Vietnamese coffee, bubble tea and finger foods."}
{"text":"Where do i begin....this is my go-to spot when I want deliciousness and everything awesome! Another successful day! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"One of the best Cafes I've been to in Charlotte! The staff is super friendly and generous, always willing to help. My kids LOVE this place; every time I tell my kids that I'm running an errand, they beg me to stop by to grab something. I love their Banh Mi Thit Nuong, sweet yet mouth watering. The music played is catchy, the candles are very appealing, the fresh picked flowers are beautiful, and their chandeliers are lovely."}
{"text":"The mason jars fruit drinks are really good. But keep in mind that this cafe serve the smaller sized boba most of the time. The staff were friendly and they offered to remake my drink after I accidentally made a mistake with my order."}
{"text":"I loooove this place. I always get their banh mi with egg and some juice or smoothie. They have the best drinks and the presentation is amazing. They add fresh fruit to the top and little pieces in your juice, seriously so refreshing and delicious. They also have boba tea which is nice but I personally am not a huge fan. They also have smaller plates with popcorn shrimp, fries, sweet potato fries. A lot of people come here to do homework and relax. They have a little couch area in the corner."}
{"text":"the only thing i tried is the bubble tea from this place. the bubble tea is not authentic, made of flavor syrup and powders."}
{"text":"Staff are super nice. Passion lemonade was delicious and so was the green tea cheesecake.

Can't wait to try their banh mi coming this winter they said!"}
{"text":"I visited Tea Fusion Cafe for the first time last week and went again today.  Last week, I had Mega Mango Tea Mason Jar Refresher and a Grilled Pork Banh Mi.  It was awesome!  We ordered calamari for the table and it also delicious.   We told our coworkers how good it was and they wanted to go with us.  So, today we went back.  Today, I had the Lemongrass Chicken Banh Mi and Strawberry Kiss Tea Mason Jar Refresher.  The chicken was a tad too salty, but the overall flavor was good.  The strawberry tea was good, but not as good as the mango.  For people who don't like overly sweet drinks, strawberry is for you.  We ordered calamari and popcorn chicken for the table.  Calamari was better hands down.  I'll definitely visit again and try something new.  But, I'm thinking that the grilled pork and mango tea from my first visit will be hard to top. Also, the staff is very nice and helpful if you questions about any of the food or drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, and ordered to go. We got sweet chilli edemame, the bulgogi banh mi, pork banh mi, and coffee bubble tea. Everything was excellent!  Food was great, the drink was great, and the customer service was very good!  The cafe was very clean, and had a really nice ambiance. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Finally a great boba place near the university area! loads of choices! We got the papaya and  green tea bubble teas and they are very refreshing!"}
{"text":"A huge, ginormous, wonderful thank you to Nikki for the review on Tea Fusion. I bookmarked this place the second I read her glowing review. I love boba (or bubble tea). Growing up in Vegas, it was always just a \"thing\" to go meet friends for boba, eat chicken, and just chill. I have now found my Charlotte version of this!

The korean bbq bahn mi was delicious - the meat was tender and sweet with the right about of veggies. I wish the bread was a little more crispy, but I'll take it.

We also had the popcorn chicken. So hot, freshly made, and served in a little box with sticks to grab it with. It has a slight spice to it, but not too much. Just great.

My ONE complaint is that the tapioca balls are not my favorite ones I've had. I've been to this place twice - the first time, they were a little small (for my liking). The second time, they tasted slightly undercooked. This place definitely has the best boba I've had in North Carolina, but not a 100% winner. 

I will definitely come back! I'll also give an update on the tapioca verdict next time."}
{"text":"The vibe was super underwhelming. I had the coffee bubble tea and it was not my favorite, we also got the ice cream stuff and it tasted good but weird. I probably won't be back just for drinks. Their food smelled good but I didn't get any. If your looking for a place to study with cool drinks, maybe keep looking"}
{"text":"Tea Masion Jars are delicious! The owner has wonderful customer service! There's no other place around town like Tea Fusion!"}
{"text":"Oh yes!!!!  All the teas are delicious. Fresh fruits, great assortment of jellies and boba, and lots of variety of drinks I've not had yet but intend to soon. Banh mi have been added to the menu and they were good. They need a veggie one for my vegan days :). Hopefully soon.  Anyway, yes, love this place!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! They have a wide variety of drinks and some snacks. Large lounge area with games and free wifi. The service was fast and friendly! 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Shaved ice cream (consistently good!!!) All kinds of fruit and bubble tea (consistently good!). Popcorn chicken (quality has gone down a little since store first opened), popcorn shrimp, fried oysters (portion on the smaller side), fried tofu cubes (love the fried tofu)."}
{"text":"Being Asain i love eating Banh Mi, and bubble Tea,  so when my friend told me about this place i came to try them. Well let me being with this: 

So i  visit this place a couple of times, but i mostly go for the drinks, which are really good.   But the food could be better. 

The first time i came with my husband to meet up with our friend and we go their bugoggi ( i think thats how you spell it) sandwhich, and one of their appetizer the popcorn chicken. Well let me start off by saying that the appetizer was nothing but breading didnt have much meat on them and taste like it was store bought. 

The sandwhich wasn't that good neither, the sandwhich didn't have much flavor. To me it was salty and there was hardy any veggies on the sandwhich or meat. The sandwhich had only 2 strips of meat. Tonight i went there to get me some drink and i got hungry so i got me a grilled pork sandwhich but this sandwhich had no flavor either and just like the other sandwhich it only had 2 strip hardy any veggies.

From my experience i would go there for drinks but not food unless your hungry. 

There is another Banh Mi place that just open in the next shopping center and i have to say their food is better."}
{"text":"Nice friendly place. My mangonada was amazing and the sandwiches was really good too. I wish I live close by but definitely come back if in the area again"}
{"text":"Great tea/ boba spot! Mason jar teas are amazing and cute!
Wish we lived closer or had one near us but when we're in the area we stop and get refreshments."}
