{"text":"This place is totally understaffed. On a Friday evening with a full house (approximately 40 diners) and you only have 2 hostess serving everyone. Waited 30 minutes to be seated because the staff cannot clear the table fast enough. 30 minutes after waiting for food the waitress told us it will be another 45 min+ wait time. Hopefully they can improve and my next visit will be a more pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Their fruit cold noodle is amazing. Very cozy environment. Fusion type of food.  Worth to try."}
{"text":"Warm and welcoming authentic Korean place. We had noodles and beef Bulgogi. The portion, taste and atmosphere is above expectation.  There's a lot of parking at the back of the front is full."}
{"text":"Newly opened and decided to finally try it out. Had the beef broth guksu which was very delicious. The broth was very rich in flavour. I wish there was a little less carrot in the dish and more variety of vegetables. Overall I would definitely be back and try out some of their cold noodles."}
{"text":"Delicious noodles, I've tried both the chicken guksu and gogi guksu, the chef usually puts in a lot of veggies and a generous amount of meat which is exactly how I like it.  My favorite dish is definitely the spicy pork bulgogi, I order it every time. The sauce that comes with it is incredible.  Service is really good, very nice and attentive, and the atmosphere has a classy jazzy feel."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was the highlight of this place. The place has a woodsy feel, the dishes and cutlery are rustic, and, like many have noted, the music was ambient. However, I was surprised to find the service inattentive - especially considering that the place was barely 50% full.  I got the hot beef noodles - it was okay but far from mindblowing. Also, for a Korean restaurant, there is a surprising lack of \"banchan\": one dish of kimchi. All in all, I'm confused at the 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Loved the spicy noodles and pork belly sous vide with kimchi!! Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"this is definitely my favourite Korean noodles place! the staffs are always very friendly and welcoming. the food has been constantly good!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for clean healthy home cooked like noodles this place is a good option. We had the  chicken guksu and pork guksu. The chicken broth was better than the pork. The value for the food is reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is super tasty ! I know the word noodle is in the name but honestly my favourite dishes are the dumplings, deep fried veggies and all the meats !!! They have so many side dishes here! I love the kimchi pork ! The portions are also huge !  I've also never been to a place with so many different choices for cold noodles too! Usually Korean restaurants will have lots of hot food and 1 cold noodle option. They actually have 4 different cold noodles here ! It's so darn good!   The parking is limited in the front so pro tip coming...... they have parking in the back ! Lots of it too! So make sure you park there !"}
{"text":"Yum!delicious! Hearty! Saw high rating on yelp and I marked it as `favourite`(i.e.place to try). After 6months, I finally had a chance to come here. Ordered chicken noodle soup and spicy bulgogi poach egg. The soup broth is perfect! The flavour is just right, and it has lots of veggies/mushrooms. I also tried adding the spicy kimchi to the broth. It gives a nice spicy kick flavour. The spicy bulgogi is also good, even though not exactly what I expected (considering the majority high rating review talks about this dish). The poach egg (the yolk) is not as runny as I thought. Otherwise it will be extra yummy to mix that runny yolk with the spicy pork. I plan to order extra poach egg on next visit.haha..."}
{"text":"As soon as I saw instagram users upload pics from this place, I knew I had to check it out. Did it meet my expectations? For the most part, yes.  The interior was nice, spacious and felt airy which means it's good for families with kids.  I was taken aback by the prices a bit ($2 more on avg than regular Korean restaurants), but once you see the dishes, I thought they were pretty reasonable. We got the gogi guksu (aka gomtamg), janchi guksu (spicy clear broth ramen), deep fried vegetables and the beansprout rice roll. The portions were very generous and tasted well seasoned. I was quite happy with my gogi guksu (beef was $1 extra). The vegetable dish was large and fried just right, however, there was a lot of potato and not so much of other veg. Still enjoyed it. The only letdown was the service. A lot of Korean restaurants seem to hire visa students who are friendly but not very attentive. The other server, a middle-aged lady, was just doing stretches and yoga moves just beyond the divider lol. We saw her from outside of the restaurant as well. :) Oh well, more importantly the food was good and we would probably come back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"I feel so relaxed as I entered the restaurant from the hot street outside. It was playing jazz music with piano and the air condition was cool and comfortable. I ordered a bowl of Cold Chogye Guksu. It is a bowl of cold noodles topped with layers of vegetables (slices of purple onion, slices of eggs, slices of turnips, cucumbers) and a few slices of pork). The soup base is icy cold sweet vinegar and it makes you feel like appetizing to eat more. The meat is on the warm side and it didn't overwhelm the cold noodles. Besides, the tea, Gnmai cha, tastes good too. It is good! Good! GOOD"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after seeing it all over my Facebook from BlogTO. Aside from the hipster interior design and big portioning of food, the taste itself was only worth a 3 star rating.  Since it's still winter in March I didn't even bother to look at the cold noodle section, so I got the gogi noodle (no. 3) & no.2... I don't recall the name of it. Gogi noodle comes with the option of either pork or beef added to it. The soup base for the gogi noodle tasted very similar to that of sullungtang for those of you who are familiar with Korean food. But it lacked flavour. Tasted pretty bland imo. It felt like I had to eventually force-feed myself to finish it. No. 2 had a soybean/doenjang flavour with a bit of spice in it.   The service was exceptional. The waiter would keep coming back to make sure everything was okay, and continuously refilled our cups with hot tea, which makes me happy. (Loved the tea, would like to know what it is) and although the only side dish happened to be kimchi, I could definitely tell that it was homemade."}
{"text":"There was such thing as korean noodle soup?!?!?! I never kneeeeewwwww! But now I dooooo! Noodle soups are theeeee best! Now I have another option among pho and chinese!  It was a great discovery! Came here a couple weeks ago with a friend and it wasn't too busy. Maybe 5-6 tables besides us. We were greeted and served by a friendly waitress who was patient but attentive and frequently checking on us about whether we were ready to order or not, if the food was ok and refilling out water :) on point service! The restaurant is pretty clean too.  Food time! The noodles came out in a timely manner and they were both very good! I ordered the Cold Chogye Mool Naeng Myun and my friend ordered the Gogi Guksu. The flavours were really complimenting each other and it did not become overwhelming or repetitive to the taste buds. Each had their strengths and the differences were obviously one was cold served and the other hot served. The noodles were enjoyably chewy but not difficult to the point where you struggle to bite off the noodles.  It's definitely different from your usual korean cuisine of hot stone bowl soups or kbbq but also different from the pho and chinese noodle soup styles too! Soooo, if you want to try something different or want to change it up a bit but still have the comfort of noodle soups, The Guksu and Noodle would be a place to try your taste buds!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy noodle soup, this is definitely somewhere you've got to try ! We ordered No. 1 Chicken Guksu - thick wheat noodle in chicken broth topped with marinated thin sliced chicken breast and various vegetables ($11.0), No. 3 Gogi Guksu - thin wheat noodle in meat broth topped with soy sous vide pork green onion and mushrooms ($11.0) and No. 23 BBQ herb samgyupsal: herb marinated pork belly with sauce ($13.0).  Food: No. 1 was a really light chicken broth but none the less flavourful. The noodles were really soft and chewy - perfect for my boyfriend who's currently sick right now. No. 3 was absolutely delicious. At first I was slightly disappointed as it looked like regular vermicelli (which I normally am not a huge fan of) however the noodles were super smooth but none the less still chewy (although slightly less chewy compared to the thick ones). The broth was amazing as it somehow combined a hearty yet light flavour. I drank so much of it and yet still didn't feel my mouth drying (as the saltier soup bases do sometimes). There was the option between pork and beef (for $1.0 more) but I chose pork thinking the hot soup would over cook the beef. I was very satisfied with the pork as it was tender and moist by itself.  No. 23 was really tasty pork belly as it was lightly grilled and crisp with the sauce. The meat they used had a perfect balance of meat and fat which allowed it to be.   Verdict: would 10/10 come back and can't wait to try their cold noodles next time after this promising first experience ! the portions were plenty and I'm so glad we only ordered the small meat dish !  Tips:  1. there's extra parking behind the restaurant.  2. they give you Kim Chi and cold squash as a side."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  Tried out this new Korean noodle soup joint and it definitely does have the potential to be a solid 4 stars.  Service was attentive and genuine the way it should be. They asked if it was our first time here and provided a few recommendations.  Had the Gogi Guksu which was a pork based broth noodle soup with wheat noodles. The soup base had a nice pork flavour and an almost milky-like texture. Would have preferred the soup base to be a bit hotter in temperature but do like how it tasted so natural and comforting.  Nothing much to say about the noodles, was too soft for my taste. Perhaps next time I should ask for the thicker noodles.   The main star of the dish was definitely the pork belly. Super smooth texture, moist and nicely prepared.   Hopefully this place will grow on me as I will head back again to try the rest of their menu offerings."}
{"text":"I crazy love this place. like, CRAZY love. This little gem makes the most amazing Korean noodle soup and bibimbap ever, and the value is mind-boggling. Parking here is a bit frustrating as it shares a lot with a few neighbours, so we had to circle around a bit before we finally were able to get a spot. But once inside, I was treated to some amaaaazing food. Not only that, but you get a complimentary appetizer (ours was mashed sweet potato which my little one loved), and the portions were perfect for my hungry husband.   Service was great, they were attentive and interacted with my kiddo and refilled our small dishes over and over again. I'm so happy we gave this place a try. The menu is limited, but what they do have is perfection!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden on yonge street right opposite of thornhill bar. Soup base for the noodles is really clear and flavor and they have an unique noodles very different from other places. Not a lot of selection but the food is really good. Also we ordered bulgogi with egg. Suppose to come with poach egg but we asked for cooked egg cause can't have raw egg. Very tasty for the bulgogi just cooked in right time. Not a lot of side dishes like other Korean restaurant. Worth a try and will go back when crave for noodles."}
{"text":"You don't see a lot of authentic Korean noodle places so it's nice to see a place that doesn't just serve the typical Korean fare.   I ordered the pork gogi noodle soup $11. The soup was a clear pork broth with vegetables, egg and grilled pork. The portions are huge for noodle soups. The grilled pork was delicious and the noodles tasted like vermicelli.  The only con, and that's a personal one is the fact that the soup taste too bland. I wish I had some hot sauce with it.  Our group also ordered the soya sauce grilled pork belly regular size foe $14 and the vegetable tempura $10. Both were delicious. If there is a dish that shines, it would be the side dishes.   The kimchi here is also amazing and all meals come with an appetizer. - we had a congee appetizer.   The service is great and the waiter always checks up on you for tea and anything you need.   There is more parking spots at the back and an entrance as well from the back. I would like to come back to try the other side dishes and maybe a spicer soup."}
{"text":"One of the best hands down noodle places I have ever been to. Its flavorful, filling and very very well done.   I went for dinner ordering a cold soba noodle and a classic kalgoksu noodle. I wanted to try the hot and cold versions so me and my friend each ordered the difference to try.   To share we decided to order the bulgogi with egg and bean sprouts...again soooo good. Everything was cooked so well and flavorful. The to share bulgogi dish pork was very well marinated while the bean sprouts were cooked well filled with flavor. Something to point out their kimchi served as side dish was one of the best I've had. Usually they are overly sour or just spicy. But their kimchi was on point. Not only was it tangy, sweet , sour, spicy but also garlicky. Loved the array of flavours that was within the kimchi. Not to mention you could tell they were fresh since it was very crunchy.  Speaking personally from my cold soba noodles its a great dish for a hot summer's day. They served wasabi on the side as traditional soba does. The soysauce flavoured broth was not just salty but sweet and vinegery. It was topped with seaweed and an abundance of garnishes. If you are hungry this is the place to go all the noodles are of huge proportion."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the buck wheat thick noodles - perfect thickness and texture. Would recommend the spicy soup base for more flavour! Came here at 8pm and wanted to order the \"side dishes\" which is their protein meat plates... but they said that portion of the kitchen has closed?? At 8pm?! I heard the table next to us not content as well as they tried to order a meat dish...their food is good but they lost the stars to not full menu available during reg hours and they had so many fruit flies that kept interfering. I dont know if it was just the corner seat we had but ... at that rate i would think the kitchen and the food may have it too..."}
{"text":"Guksu is a Korean noodle dish made with thin wheat noodles in a clear broth.  Top it off with various toppings and you have a nice simple, tasty, and healthy meal.  We have been here a few times now and the food was consistent.  The location is a small plaza on east side of Yonge right at Centre street.  Their signage outside is a bit interesting as the word guksu is only written in Korean.  I only found out the name of the place after I came inside the restaurant.  In front it looks like there is no parking but there is ample parking in the rear of the building. You can also enter the restaurant from the back.  The inside itself is clean and modern and nicely renovated.  Note they seem to not have any heating in the men's room as it's colder than a meat locker!  Anyways, onto the food - we have ordered the Chicken Guksu, Gogi Guksu, bulgogi, and dumplings.  The Chicken Guksu is cooked to a different texture than your typical chicken breast.  It is thinly sliced and just ever-so-slightly under-cooked, so the chicken is very soft.  The broth is very light.  It comes with thick noodles.  Gogi Guksu is pork noodles with a heartier broth.  The noodles for this dish are thin and similar to a thick vermicelli.  Of the two noodles (thick vs. thin), I prefer the thick as they are chewier, however you can't go wrong with either.  The dumplings were pretty standard korean dumplings, and good for kids (actually this place is totally good for kids as all kids seem to like noodles and dumplings!)  However, even though this is a noodle place, the star of the show is definitely the bulgogi.  We got this as an add on but the portion size is large.  The BBQ flavour shines through and for me this is one of the best tasting bulgogis in recent memory!  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is another restaurant that I knew about through Instagram.  It's called The Guksu and Noodle and serves Korean hot and cold noodles and rice dishes.  We arrived at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday and it was moderately full of customers.  There were a lot more Cantonese guests here than I anticipated.  I knew I wanted something hot and soupy as it was cold outside.  We both happened to order the Janchi Guksu, a bowl of thin wheat noodle in light anchovy broth topped with various vegetables and thin sliced egg.  But first, we received a small bowl of Korean congee to start.  It was so comforting on a cold day!  The kimchi was also complimentary.  It was so much spicier than I could tolerate.  The Chicken Salad was presented on a platter and arranged so beautifully.  It had marinated thin sliced chicken breast atop of fresh seasonal vegetables.  I really liked the tangy vinaigrette in this salad.  The two bowls of Janchi Guksu noodles arrived so quickly!  I liked the clear light anchovy broth and the thin wheat noodles!  It was definitely comfort food, devoid of any excess fat, and thus healthy for you.  I would love to return to try their other noodle soups and side dishes!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and very attentive! The noodle was a bit bland, perhaps I like things with strong flavours. The sous vide pork appetizer was not bad, except it feels a bit fat after eating it.  The broth was nicely done, both the anchovy one and Gogi Guksu broth was also nice, except the noodle tasted a bit bland.   Overall, worth a try if you haven't ventured out!"}
{"text":"More so 3.5 but closer to 4 than 3 stars.  As stated in their name, I found the noodles at this small cozy restaurant to be the best of all the dishes I've tried. Service was great. We came close to last call, but the waiter was really polite about it and helped us with our order with recommendations.  Kimchi complimentary dish - nice and freshly pickled. The spice was perfect with good heat. Not sour but tasted fresh.  Chicken/beef rice with mixed veggies - the non stone pot version of bibimbap. We ordered both the chicken and beef but I preferred the flavours of the beef. To be honest, although the ingredients found within these dishes were nicely cooked and fresh, the rice dish itself is rather bland unless Korean gojujang sauce is added. The  dish does come with a broth which is beautifully seasoned, though, for you to make the rice wetter if wanted.  Chicken noodles - this dish was delicious. Again the broth was beautifully seasoned with heavy notes of chicken but not overly salty or msg/ get thirsty after first sips. Needless to say, the noodles were well cooked and perfect elasticity. The chicken within the dish alongside the veggies were well paired.   We also ordered the steamed dumplings, which tasted like regular steamed dumplings, and their pork belly, which was very nicely sous vide'd and seasoned. The pork is definitely a must try!  Overall would come back for the noodles and pork. Maybe will try their bibimbap to see if that makes a difference."}
{"text":"Really good korean dish place. The only thing that's difficult about this place is the fact that most of their dishes have meat in it."}
{"text":"For those of you planning on going, the 'Guksu' part of their name is in Korean, so their sign says The (insert Korean characters) and Noodle. Hopefully, that'll make it easier for you guys to find it. There's some parking in the front, but there's also parking in the back.  I'm guessing the BlogTO feature is drawing the crowds to The Guksu and Noodle. I have a feeling that if I had been able to order what I wanted, I would have given The Guksu and Noodle a higher rating. We were told that over the long weekend, they were super busy, and so they had run out of sous vide pork. This meant that we couldn't order any of the soo yuk items, and we couldn't get noodles with pork. I had wanted to get the gogi guksu with pork, but they didn't have it, and they said they could substitute chicken, but not beef, which is a dollar upgrade.  Service, when we had it, was polite. Tea was good (roasted grain?) They don't leave a teapot on your table, so you have to wait for a waiter to either come fill your cup, or flag a waiter down in order to get your cups refilled. They either didn't have enough wait staff or they were all clustered in one area. The Guksu and Noodle has a main seating section, and then a section off to the side. We were off to the side. I'd say about half the time, there was no waiter in our section, and this proved difficult because we couldn't flag them down if they weren't in our section unless we got out of our seats, because they can't see us from the main section. It wasn't a total hassle, but it could have been better.  They served each of us a small dollop of cold pureed pumpkin and what I think was mint shreds, topped with a couple of pumpkin seeds. It was tasty and refreshing, but as free appetizers go, this one wasn't particularly impressive. They also served us two dishes of kimchi. I don't know my kimchi very well, but I'm guessing this was fresher kimchi. Brighter in color. Less sour.  I ended up getting the janchi guksu, which is an anchovy broth with thin noodles, topped with assorted veggies, tofu, and strips of fried egg. It was tasty, but nothing I don't think I could make at home, other than the noodles. It was a generous portion, but at $9, I do not think I would go out of my way to come get it again.    My friends and I traded bites of our food, so I got to try a few of the other dishes as well. The chicken guksu's soup actually has chicken flavor. It's quite homey. It comes in a large bowl and they put a bit of red pepper paste on the side of the bowl in case you want it spicy. The gogi guksu with beef does taste like meat broth, but I was expecting beefier, and while it did have beef flavor, it wasn't very distinct.   The portions are good and the pretty noodle pictures abound, but the food wasn't outstanding.  Side note: They do split bills if you ask."}
{"text":"The restaurant name was intriguing and I saw Jennifer K had reviewed it, so hubby and I decided to try this place out as we were in the area.  The restaurant is spacious and plainly but nicely decorated with lots of wood details. Only a few tables were occupied when we first came in around noon but it got busier by the time our food arrived.   This place specializes in cold and hot noodle dishes as well as traditional Korean dishes like bulgogi and bibimbap. We opted to try their Gogi Guksu, a hot noodle soup with lots of vegetables and a choice of sous vide pork or beef (we chose the latter). The broth was flavourful and had a light creamy consistency. The portion was generous despite the $11 price point. I ordered the chicken bibimbap with sous vide chicken which was ok but not what I would write home about. It came with a side of clear broth.   As per Jennifer K's tip, we tried the sous vide pork belly with soy dressing which was tender and delicious. This was served with a side \"salad\" of green onions, beet strands, some other flat chive-looking vegetable, and micro pea shoots.  Overall the food was pretty good and the price point was reasonable. If you have gluten intolerance, be forewarned that the noodles listed were wheat and buckwheat noodles. The menu lists that \"noodle substitution is available\" but I don't know if that includes changing to a gluten friendly option.  1/100 (2017)"}
{"text":"Came here after a small dessert so I wasn't that hungry. But I ate enough at this restaurant it hurt to walk and it was definitely worth it. The atmosphere in the restaurant is nothing particularly special. But it's quiet enough. I was with a friend, we ended up getting 1 app and 2 hit noodle dishes. Who wants to eat cold noodles on a winters day. I was definitely surprised about  the pork. Though sous vide sounds fancy. I'm not sure in this application whether it needs to be cooked that way. With that said, it was absolutely delicious.  We had the herb pork belly as well. I was still savouring the sous vide pork but it was still decent. It's a nice small restaurant a little out of the way with very reasonable prices. I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"This has been my favourite places to go for Noodles and Korean side dishes lately.  Came here twice and was able to try different dishes.  Guksu in Korean means noodles, so it is expected their noodles to be great, and it did live up to its name!  I tried their Hot Noodles and Cold Noodles and I personally prefer the Hot Noodles more, especially the Gogi Guksu which you can pick Beef or Pork and it is served in a thin noodle.  Cold noodle is also decent but the broth has a sour taste to it which is normal for cold noodle according to my Korean friends, so I prefer the Cold Momill Guksu the most out of all the cold noodles selections since the broth is not as sour!  What really surprised me is how good their side dishes were too!  I had pretty much tried everything and I have to say my favourite is the Spicy Pork Bulgogi and Kimchi Soo Yuk (Kimchi on Pork Belly).  Even the small portion is generous but if you have 3-4 guys going, go with the Large Portion.  The meat is so good and I can eat a few of these side dishes by myself!!  Overall 5/5, prices are very reasonable, portion is generous, delicious food and great services!!   P.S. - The front parking looks deceiving since it has so little spots, but they do have a back parking lot and that is HUGE!  Make sure you park at the back and you can enter the restaurant from the back door too."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time, and I enjoyed it very much. I love noodles and it was great to find another noodle places, especially since you don't really find that many Korean places that specialize in noodles. They've got a good variety of types of noodles, some hot and some cold. There is bibimbap as well for the people who don't want noodles. The best thing is how affordable the food and how big the portion sizes are while still maintaining t quality. Service was also very nice and attentive. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I was driving down Yonge looking for something hearty to eat when I came across this place. It was a bit random to see it situated there as there weren't many eateries around; however, the interior was modern & nicely designed. And there's a lot more parking at the back than the front. Since the word Guksu is in their name, I obviously had to try their specialty; so my friend and I ordered two gogi guksu, one w/ pork and the other w/ beef.    The bowls came with thin wheat noodles that resembled a thicker version of vermicelli. Although the portion was huge, we found it a bit bland & lacked texture. It doesn't help that the broth was mellow in taste as well, so the only real flavoring came from the pork & beef; the soup could also have been hotter. However, I did enjoy the pork quite a bit; it was tender & had a deep richness to it. The beef, on the other hand, was too tough & the charred flavor didn't particularly stand out.   All in all, it was an okay bowl of noodles. If I do come back, I would get their soy sooyuk or herb samgyupsal (side dishes) as they prepared their pork well."}
{"text":"This place specializes in Korean hot and cold noodles. Vibe is really good! Service was great and the food was yummy with big portions. Food is also really reasonably priced! Definitely worth checking out.   We got momilguksu and gogi noodles. Both really good!"}
{"text":"Best cold noodle variety and pork belly fish. Service is attentive and atmosphere is classy"}
{"text":"New place that replaced Phuket paradise. I passed by multiple times but finally dropped in to try. Their menu had tried and true classics like bulgogi and janchi guksu and some modern dishes like Fruit Bibimguksu. It was a hot day so I decided to try the fruit and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a savoury dish that was tangy and spicy and the fruit was just right in adding that sweetness. It was cold so it was the perfect dish for a summer day. Portions were pretty good and the price ($10.5) was great. I would definitely try the Kong Guksu when I go back!  Also, the Korean name for it is the and noodle (in case some where searching and looking for it online like i was) and its English name is the guksu and noodle."}
{"text":"Came with a friend for lunch on a quiet Sunday we were immediately greeted and seated at a table for four. Aside from my friend and I, there were two other seated tables.  The server asked if we were to order a few minutes after  we were seated. He came around a second time within a few minutes while we were still checking out the menu. Considering how empty the place was, I felt his urgency to be unnecessary. We started off with ordering dumplings the second time our server came around.  After checking out some reviews, we had both ordered the guksu; pork for my friend, beef for me. The server was prompt with bringing the side dishes. The dumplings arrived shortly after, followed by our entrees, which arrived at the same time. The pricing is justified by the portions. Now, the important part: the broth. To be fair, this was my first time trying guksu so my judgment is based on my tastes for broth noodles. I felt that the broth was both simultaneously flavorful and tasteless. The soup base could use a bit more salt, as it was leaning more towards flavoured water than soup. The buckwheat noodles were average, but went well with the soup. As a huge dumpling lover, I thought the dumplings were pretty run-of-the-mill. There was a good amount and they tasted just right.   After devouring our meals, we left the restaurant feeling more than satisfied. Although the beginning felt rushy, the servers are prompt and attentive. Our waters were filled without us having to hound down a staff member. The food is tasty and worth the price. I will be returning when I want to have a clean meal."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!! We had the fruit bibim guksu (spicy red bean noodle) and a side of kimchi pork belly. I'm Korean and typically don't love Korean restaurants because my grandmother has spoiled me but this little gem (recommended by my aunt) blew my mind lol. Also lots of free parking at the back (beside CIBC lot) and a rear entrance."}
{"text":"Took my family there for dinner tonight after going with my friends a few months back and the food was even the better than the first time I went. The broth for all the noodles were super flavourful and the noodles itself was really chewy. My favourite though would have to be the bimbimbap. The rice was chewy and there was enough seasoning that no other sauce is even needed. Adding a little bit of the sauce does give the rice a little kick that makes it taste better though. The only thing is I would have liked a tad more rice in the dish.  All in all an amazing the resturant that my family and I would for sure return to"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a hot summer night.  The decor and ambience of the restuarant reminds me of a coffee shop, a relaxing vibe, with instrumental music playing in the background.   Space: Unfortunately the day we went, the air conditioning might have been broken. It was hot and the table we got seated was a bit cramped (there were little space between our table and the table behind). We got seated in the area next to the wooden division by the door, if available, I would recommend to ask for the tables at the elevated platform, they seems more spacious.  Food: they provide congee and kimchi as appetizer which I enjoyed. There are variety of hot and cold noodles. We ordered the cold chogye guksu with chicken ($11.5) and janchi guksu with pork ($11.5). I enjoyed the chogue guksu, it is a nice dish for the summer. The sweet and sour broth is appetizing. The noodles have a good texture. However the amount of shredded chicken seems to be inconsistent (mine has little), in looking at pictures from other yelpers, some seems to have more than others. Janchi guksu has a nice grilled flavour in the broth which was good.   Overall, I would recommend if you are looking to try Korean style noodles."}
{"text":"When we first entered another group of 10 people are just checking out and it was madness. We were ignored for 4 minutes about, but finally tended to. Usually I would leave with such a first encounter but wanted to give this place a chance, and while we had a rocky start in the end they finished pretty strong.  Their menu was not terribly interesting or different, perhaps it may even seem like it's pretty skimpy which totally did not match their interior decor. The ambiance of the place, with the music and decor makes it seem like it's more upscale when really it's mainly just noodles.  While their noodles and menu selection seemed simple to the eye, it actually revealed some pretty interesting contrasting flavours. Again nothing earth shattering, but enough to make you go \"mmm not bad\". Service improved as the restaurant cleared and I am now left with the feeling that I would pay another visit sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere! Got the #3 noodle soup was delicious. Their kimchi is also really good, not too spicy or salty. A+"}
{"text":"A close friend of mine absolutely loves this place. So when his birthday came around and I asked him where he wanted to go, this was, of course, his first choice.  We got the: - Soy Soo Yuk (sous-vide pork belly), which was simple and delicious! - Boiled Dumplings, this was only OK in my opinion - Gogi Guksu - Bibim Guksu  I loved the Gogi Guksu, it was incredibly hearty and the noodles were light so it didn't feel too heavy. It came with A LOT of noodles though and considering we also got side dishes, I did not even come close to finishing it. My friend loved his bibim guksu (which was cold). He said it had a lot of flavour and depth and would consider ordering it again next time. He said it was unique as not many korean places have cold noodle dishes aside from naengmyeon.   Bonus star for the presentation of the food! Love the aesthetic they put into the dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as a group of 6 around 8 PM. It's pretty quiet at that time. Just one server at the time who was really nice but probably stretched out a little between the 3 tables. Took a while to get refills of tea. They also \"ran out of tea\" towards the end.   They gave us a small starter dish of pumpkin puree to start. Very fitting for Halloween and really good! Light, uncomplicated, and refreshing.  I ordered the Hook Hae Bibim Guksu, which was cold noodle with raw beef. Super good. It's a really refreshing dish that I would eat even in the winter. The \"spicy sauce\" is really more sweet than spicy. It wasn't spicy at all, really. Dish comes topped with a giant ball of sliced raw meat. It was still a little frozen in the centre, but at least I know I probably won't get sick from it.  Most of my friends ordered the Gogi Guksu, which was much less impressive. Less flavourful. The pork is also sweet, which I enjoyed, but apparently is strange as a dinner meal."}
{"text":"Just a tad outside of my range for it to be my regular spot. But I gotta say. One of my top noodle joints. And their slow cooked meats is so good!  Been a little while since I beeen. But it's a great spot to share their dishes.   And their decor is comfortable."}
{"text":"first thing i noticed is that this place is not oily like other Korean or Japanese restaurants. You get nice clean taste to the broth and meat. We got the beef bulogogi (you can taste a slight grill flavour) the noodle was unless and filled with vegetables. Services was five out of five."}
{"text":"Cold Chogyeguksu ($11.50) Cold buckwheat noodles in cold spicy chicken broth topped with marinated sliced chicken meat and various vegetables. The portion was huge! The bowl was bigger than my face. They were generous with the ingredients, lots of chicken, vegetables and noodles, it was like an endless bowl of noodles. You would think as the ice slush melts it would dilute the flavor of the soup but it wasn't the case! The soup flavor still held strong, was more on the sweeter end than spicy I would say. Tasty!  Gogi Guksu ($11) This seemed to be a highly recommended and top item. Thin wheat noodle in meat broth topped with soy sous vide pork, green onions and mushrooms. The portion was huge! The bowl was bigger than my face. The pork was SUPER tender. So soft it blew my mind. It was really good. And there were a decent amount of of slices, 5 thick large pieces. The soup base was good too, wasn't heavy in flavor and more of a clear soup.This bowl of noodles reminded me of a Korean version of Japanese ramen. I would totally pick this over a bowl of ramen any day. My only dislike was this wasn't served in steaming hot, but more so warm temperature.  Spicy Pork Bulgogi ($9) Grilled marinated spicy pork and poached egg served on top of a salad. This was supposed to be a side dish, but if you look at the portion it would have been enough on its own! The pork was thinly sliced just like beef bulgogi Very flavorful and tasty! This was actually my favorite dish for the night, more so than the noodles.  I really enjoyed my dinner here! Reasonable prices for large portions - remember to share unless you are a big eater! To me, this restaurant as like a Korean noodle joint, kinda like the Japanese ramen idea? Its all about the noodles."}
{"text":"Great option for something different in Korean or Asian food. The wheat noodles is light. We ordered the beef broth hot soup with beef and tendon - great and the tendon is so soft. We also ordered the bulgogi and steam dumplings and the raw beef cold noodle all were great. The raw beef dish had a sauce that tasted like whe du bop sauce. Large portions so it's good to order a few different dishes to share. We will return again. Parking is tight at the front but they have parking in the back."}
{"text":"My last visit has become a bit hazy in memory but from what I wrote, things have definitely improved on my latest visit. Everything ordered came quickly and was very delicious. Spicy pork bulgogi was done very nicely with a bit of char and thinly sliced, served with a poached egg and some pickled radish. My girlfriend and I left completely sated of our cold noodle cravings."}
{"text":"Noticed/passed by this place a lot, and finally decided to try it out. The three of us ordered different noodle dishes, all of them were very good and different in flavor. Each dish was made with a different type of noodle, the noodles were cooked perfectly. Would recommend the cold noodle for summer and their guksu for winter.   I think this place is underrated perhaps because of its location. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Newly opened restaurant around my neighbourhood; finally decided to drop by. My first impression as i walked in the door was that the venue is deceptively large. The interior design along with the classical music playing in the background gave this venue a touch of class. The staff was very friendly and the orders were quick. Both the chicken guksu and gogi guksu were made in a rich broth and the noodles were chewy. Although the squash appetizer felt somewhat out of place, the overall quality of the food justifies the pricetag ($11-15). 4/5 stars!"}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant from a blogTo video, and after a friend suggested to try it out, we went.   It's not quite warm enough to get the cold noodles, so my friend and I ordered the salt soo yook and each got the pork gogi guksu.   The salt soo yook was very tasty, came with green onions, reminded me of bossam. The gogi guksu was okay, the broth was hearty but borderline bland. The noodles were a bit thin and mushy. It seemed like a more modern take on the more traditional guksu...   While the guksu didn't stick out, i would come back to try the cold noodles, they looked quite tasty."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the presentation of all the dishes. Small menu with a selection of hot and cold soup noodles, Bim Bim Bap and traditional grilled Korean barbecue. Very good value here with large portions. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hot and Cold Noodle! I love noodles of any kind.  The Guksu and Noodle is my kind of place. The menu is small with the focus on mainly noodle. Guksu means Noodle Dish in Korean.   We shared:  Chicken Guksu ($11) Fruit Bibim Guksu ($10.50) Salt Soo Yuk ($9) Pork Belly  I did enjoy the Fruit Bibim Guksu which is cold noodle in a spicy fruit broth. Refreshing on a hot summer day. This is quite unique and not offered in most other restaurants.  Sous-vide seems to be such a popular preparation/cooking method for a lot of the chef nowadays. The chicken and pork belly were both prepared that way. Pork belly was soft and tender and the chicken was moist.  The Guksu and Noodle is put a modern twist to Korean Noodle dish from presentation and cooking method. The taste also more subtle and refine.  Worth giving them a try."}
{"text":"this place is unreal. Thornhill may have a new Korean noodle king! First visit it was a super hot day. Ordered a cold momil guksu similar to naeng myeon- but it had seaweed and wasabi. Radish. Shaved ice.  Buckwheat noodles. On a hot day - there may be no better meal. Really like this place and on my second visit it was much busier. He lineups at cho sun ok are putting me off - and this spot has done nothing but impress. Daeeeboookkk!!"}
{"text":"NO service at all! Not even tea after sitting down for 30 mins. We tried to wave them down, but they just ignore us......... Can't even review the food cuz it will probably take over 2 hrs..."}
{"text":"Went with a few friends to try out the newly opened Korean restaurant that specializes in hot and cold \"guksu\"(noodles). The restaurant has a classic asian asthetic feel from the wooden wall panels down to the detail in cutlery and dishes being used.   Although they specialize in korean noodle soup, the one dish i would recommend is the bbq herb samgyupsal. This grilled pork belly was tender throughout. The addition of the radish and herbed sauce gave each bite of the pork belly a tantalizing bbq taste accompanied with a refreshing  sweet taste from the radish.  I would definitely go back just for this pork belly but i heard the cold noodles were also good. Will post the gogi guksu soon!"}
{"text":"I went to try this about a month ago. I was blown away the first time as it was spacious inside and the noodles we tried Menu#1 chicken noodles soup and Menu#2 pork noodle soup were both really good. The pork noodle soup was creamy but not as salty and heavy like the Japanese ramen.  We also ordered their homemade dumplings and they were great too. The second time we went was at  a Saturday lunch time after it just opened. I felt they weren't ready at that moment. The dumplings were overcooked and the meat felt out of the skin on the plate. I also felt the noodles weren't as hot as the first time we tried. I highly recommend to go in the evening instead when they are more prepared.  In addition, I hope they would add more items on the menu. If you don't eat the cold noodles, there are only 3 choices of hot noodle soup to choose from the menu."}
{"text":"This BBQ Herb Samgyupsal, herb marinated pork belly is amazing. I normally don't eat pork belly but this was meaty yet tender and flavorful. It had a subtle sweetness and smoky flavor. I wrapped the meet with veggies and green onions- delicious.  I prefer the thick noodles they have here over the thin ones. My go to order is the chicken guksu or the spicy Guksu. I can't wait to try some of their cold noodles during the summer time  Their dumplings are nothing special... wouldn't recommend as they taste just like the frozen ones from grocery stores.  I would recommend the deep fried vegetables... large portion and reasonably priced! Perfect for sharing"}
{"text":"Located on Yonge Street just north of Centre in Thornhill, the restaurant occupies the location of so many ill-fated others.    After Wok on Yonge, there was a small parade of restauranteers that tried to make a go of it.  Though it looks small from the outside, the restaurant seats quite a few people on its two floored shop.    Parking is a problem for people who think that the few spots upfront is it - there are plenty of spots in the back.  They should put up a sign, as people see the three spots up front occupied and will opt not to go there.  I used to think that years ago with Wok on Yonge.  Not sure if it's been said but it's funny how the place is named The \"Noodle\" and Noodle - even if the previous is written in Korean.  Anyways, the place is almost a three star for me.  Had the Chicken Guksu and the Cold Momill Guksu for lunch.  The Momill Guksu is much like the japanese Zaru-Soba - grated radish, some seaweed, sweet-ish sauce-base, green onions on top of Soba noodles and served cold.  It was ok but far too sweet for us and I think the soy base was off in flavour.  The Chicken Guksu was ok at best.  The chicken itself tasted like it was boiled forever to make a broth for a base and then used for this dish.  The soup based was ok - I guess from all the chicken meat to make it.  The noodles in both dishes were well prepared.  Perhaps I just chose the wrong ones.  The other guests were slurping it up happily - most had the spicy noodle.  The restaurant business is a tough one to take on and I have not seen this place packed at anytime at all.  Though not anything stellar on my list, it is worth a repeat visit.  I just hope they do well enough to make it a go.  Cheers!"}
