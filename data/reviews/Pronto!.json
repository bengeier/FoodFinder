{"text":"Great service,  great food. You can taste the quality. Also,  pesto with fries is a great combo"}
{"text":"Service is great! The eggplant parmesan is amazing! Its cute and quaint. My only advice would be make sure the customers cant see you texting in kitchen."}
{"text":"My wife and I love good food and love finding gems like Presto.  Great food, great service, great presentation.

We love it.   We were at DBA in Akron last week and wish we had come here

{"text":"This place is the best!  We found it online by accident and saw the pictures of their food and had to try it!  Phillip is the best waiter he always takes care of us.  Food and staff are spectacular!  If you get the chance definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"You MUST try this place!  Absolutely delicious food with amazing service.  Make sure to leave room for the apple crostata with gelato!"}
{"text":"We came on a whim after reading the great reviews and wow was it awesome!  We ended a phenomenal meal with the best carrot cake I have ever had!  Please come and support this really great local restaurant!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was a great take out experience. So we took everyone and went in for a wonderful meal! Delightfully surprised they had a kids menu! I had the chicken parmesan, and my husband had the egg plant parmesan. Both were delicious, however I think the egg plant was spectacular, I can't wait to go back and have it! Save room for dessert, so yummy! 
The service was absolutely great as well, even though it was so busy!
Great meal, a must try!"}
{"text":"Love this place, food is great and staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I saw the 5*'s from the other reviews and was a little skeptical.  Let me say I was a soooo glad we ate here. The food was hot, fresh and amazing.  Hidden gem."}
{"text":"We read the reviews on Yelp and Pronto sounded great and it was.  You cannot tell from the outside, so do not keep driving, stop in!   Karen greeted us as we came in and the service as well as the gazpacho soup was not only delicious but was presented very well.   I had the seasonal salad and my husband had the Hummus naanwich was fresh and filling with the fries."}
{"text":"Excellent. 

Strange location kept me from this place for a while, and I really regret that. Not fancy, but a really enjoyable experience.

Alex was a great server, and everybody else seemed friendly as well.

The menu is full of fun options without being overwhelming. Two of us shared two dishes: the chicken parmesan and the BLT pasta. Both were superb, and really well plated. The chicken parm may be my favorite I've ever had-- that good. The cream sauce on the BLT pasta was awesome, and the tomatoes and Swiss chard were perfectly cooked.

I plan to be back often. My first experience was really excellent."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, and have never been disappointed. We recently went for a late lunch on a weekday, we were the only people in there, and let me say the staff is awesome, friendly and helpful. We even listened as the on employee took a call from someone with a very specific diet. I was impressed at how well the employee helped the person. The food is simply amazing here too I had the Cuban sandwich and as I am writing this I would very much like to eat it right now. Go here and enjoy. the place is small but worth it, also try the apple thingy its AMAZING."}
{"text":"Pricey, salad is extra, good selection of beer, but out of several.  Filet was excellent but potato nest tasted like tumbleweed. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"I have just learned that this restaurant has closed. Very sad!"}
{"text":"Top notch.  Not sure if anything else really needs to be said.  This place is just a no brainier if you live in the area you have to come here!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service.  I got the BLT pasta and it was delicious.  It was also very nice to hear that a lot of the ingredients are locally grown and that the food is made from scratch."}
{"text":"Had to give an amazing shout out to the chef and staff to go out their way to fulfill my order. Called to order the pappadelle pasta with lamb ragu and was informed they no longer carry it. Definitely was a little disappointed since it was truly one of the best dishes in cleveland.  Ended up not ordering anything and had to figure something else out for dinner. Got a call back 5 min later from Alex and was informed the chef was willing to make 1 last order. I jumped at the opportunity and headed out right away. Ended up the chef decided to comp the dish which was completely unexpected and ultimately amazing. Have been a chef in nyc for a small family restaurant it was truly nice to still see small business go out their way for their customers. Would highly recommend pronto to anybody and have been in the industry this restaurant can compete with the beat restaurants in Manhattan.  The entire staff is very professional as well as being good people. Made my night with this small gesture and will be going back to pronto in the near future."}
{"text":"Nice surprise for lunch. Fresh ingredients well prepared. Will return in anticipation of another good meal."}
{"text":"Really great food, great service, we'll be back. We had pasta prima Vera, huge chicken Parm, great spicy flatbread."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food, wonderful presentation! Get there early cuz the place is small. Had salad and eggplant parm. Hubby had white bean sausage soup and the ribs.  No complaints! Would have ordered squash soup rather than salad but the chef wasn't serving it til the white bean sausage was gone! :(  At least the soup is not sitting in crocks heating all day!!!  Could hear the chef pounding the chicken for chicken parm! Everything was very fresh! :)
A little pricy given the location and atmosphere. No cozy booths, tables are a little close (the place is small). 
Would go back! Maybe I'll get the squash soup next time. :)"}
{"text":"Yumminess!  Odd location but the place is fantastic!  We stopped on our way to Rocksino. Red sauce is perfect!  Orch Pasta & the best chicken parm I've had. Delish!!!  Service was cool and professional. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh yes, this place is excellent.  My husband cannot go there and not get the Italian burger. The flavors all go together to create a sensation in your mouth that my husband will not eat or drink anything after it so he keeps the taste in his mouth.  Friendly service.  Quaint atmosphere.  I have tried several dishes and they are all good.  Spread the word.  This place is way above average.  L Neval"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Service was great as was the food. Definitely recommend the BLT pasta. Love that they use local organic ingredients. So happy to have found this gem in a land overwhelmed with chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I rarely give anything 5 stars, but this place was awesome!! I searched yelp and was skeptical when I saw the rating, but decided to give it a try anyway. When we pulled up we were nervous. The building and location made me think it was a joke. This is a case of never judging a book by its cover! Thank goodness for yelp!!!! The food is great and the wait staff were awesome. The food had a unique approach and tasted great. The burger was to die for and the eggplant was great. The staff was very accommodating as we'll. the prices were also reasonable at 13.99 for an entree. Very small, cozy restaurant and a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant by E. Highland and Rt. 8. Service was as good as the food."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Recommended to us by a foodie friend. A party of four and we were all beyond pleased. 
We started with special salad of the day Herb Beef Tenderloin Salad. I wish we would have remembered to take a pix. We shared it. It was tiered and stuffed onion rings. Even our teenager liked it!
Our dinner included Chicken Parmesan, Asparagus Grilled Flat Bread Pizza,Orecchiette Pasta and Baby Back Pork Ribs. Would recommend all. The ribs fell off the bone and highlighted with an usually tasteful coleslaw. Couldn't resist the dessert. Shared a carrot Cake and Chocolate Ganache Cake. We also had to take home a lemon bar and a hidden Oreo in a chocolate chip cookie. WOULD DEFINITELY COME BACK MORE THAN ONCE."}
{"text":"We simply love dining at Pronto's, they are a cut above any Restaurant nearby, for that matter, within twenty-five miles! The Lasagna is to die for, tomatoes basil soup, out of The Tuscany Hills! If you miss Excellent Italian food, you have not been here to dine! Decor is a little old n plain but the Chef and Service Shine's! One suggestion is to add to their liquor say, Southern comfort and some good Bourbon !
 Oh, for all the New guest's, tip your waiter well @ 20%, it is worth it !

{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! The presentation of food is beautiful and makes it that much more tasteful. Very friendly as well. I am right down the street from it too and I'm glad for that! Can't wait to go back time and time again. Also they have a food truck called the green machine...so if you see it, you better go and get some food!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken parmesan and my family got the same. The staff there were super friendly and accommodating. I honestly cannot say one bad thing about Pronto except for its odd location. The portion was great and the pasta was al dente. A neat thing that attracted me as well is that they use the Belly card system which is great. If you are in Macedonia or the surrounding areas, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We really liked this place!  Small inside.  And to even eat on a Friday or Saturday u need to make reservations.  But no one was there at 5 on Wednesday.  I'm going to start by saying the water is good.  I'm picky, some water tastes bad at restaurants. We had a smoked tomato soup and we liked that.  We also tried the eggplant Parmesan soup and we all LOVED that!!!  They serve a cheese bread and we liked that.  My hubby had the chicken Parmesan and the chicken was fresh tasting and the breading was very good.  But I did not like the pasta.  I had the BLT pasta and that was very good! My son  had the spicy salami flatbread, he liked it and ate the whole thing, however, It was made with very sweet onions, and I did not like that when I tried it.  Very clean inside and server was top notch!"}
{"text":"Okay, let me say first that I almost never give five stars, but in this case they were well deserved. We were staying nearby and saw the Yelp reviews and stopped in for dinner. Had a great smokey bacon onion chive soup, BLT pasta and pappardella with lamb ragu. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned. I thought it was a good sign when I noticed that there was no salt or pepper on the tables, a chef confident in his seasoning. Not to say that everything was perfect. Our server was super prompt, almost too much so. We weren't really given time to relax and savor our meal, but felt a little pressured to move right along. But maybe that shouldn't be a surprise at a restaurant named Pronto! If we are passing through again we'll definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow wow wow wow wow. If you haven't been, you should go now. Pronto! (sorry, couldn't resist) An absolutely amazing experience. Everything was so wonderful! This place is small and easy to miss, but it's a gem! Fair warning: there will be a lot of adjectives in this. 

Seating was a hit cramped, but all the stuff was very friendly and wanted to please. Our waitress was so eager and wanted to hear all of our comments! When giving us the introduction, she said everything was made in house--and you could taste it! They also do some interesting variations on traditional am dishes, which makes it fun in addition to tasty! 

When we entered, they started us with a delicious cheesy bread that was accompanied by a fresh, chunky, savory, delicious red sauce. My parents were very excited for their eggplant parmesans after tasting that! They then had salads--even the ceasar salad dressing tasted homemade-- while I filled my belly with the soup of the day: a delicious smoky tomato bisque. Chunky, smoky, and with a bit of balsamic and parmesan cheese, it was perfect! 

I had the blt pasta as an entree. The sauce was creamy, but not too rich and I loved that they had used the heat of the dish to wilt the arugula instead of cooking it down. My parents both had eggplant parmesan, which was really fun because the pasta was baked into the eggplant! Again, it was topped with that amazing sauce we had loved. 

We barely had room for dessert, so we split a chocolate covered pecan shortbread. HEAVEN. Highly recommend! 

On our way out, we stopped to admire the cakes that had been made for special occasions. Turns out they have a trained pastry chef, so they do cakes and other special dishes! The cakes were gorgeous and had elegant designs. Definitely a go to for your special occasions! 

If you haven't figured it out, I adored this place. You should definitely make a trip and taste its amazing dishes for yourself! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food here was SO delicious. The salad is so tasty and fresh! The chicken parmesan was delicious, absolutely the best I've had. The quality of food and drink offerings are superior to the restaurants in the proximity. Try it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side, but well worth the money. The food is handmade at the location at the time it is ordered. Very fresh, very clean. The restaurant is small, but very busy. All the tables were full the entire time we were dining there. People we talked to at the restaurant were also very satisfied with the restaurant. Excellent food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for great food locally. Somehow Pronto! slipped in under the radar. The location is not great and from the outside it does not look too promising. It was only from doing a \"near me\" search on Yelp and then reading all the great reviews that I decided to give it a try. 

I stopped in for a late lunch. I was pleased at how neat and nicely furnished the place is. The lunch menu was pretty limited to a few sandwiches and salads but that is fine with me if you do them very well. I tried the seasonal salad and the soup of the day. It was a veggie medley and included a nice variety of vegetables. The flavor was hearty and very pleasant. The salad was nicely chopped fresh greens with blueberries, sliced strawberries and almonds and feta with a light tossing of a balsamic vinaigrette and finished with freshly grilled chicken. The dressing was sparing and just right for a salad already combining such wonderful flavors and the chicken was moist and tender. The waiter said they used locally grown foods whenever possible. I finished with a carrot cake cupcake and that was also exceptional. It is a quite small space and I was the only patron at the time but the service was excellent. 

From what I've seen, they are doing things right. I cannot wait to bring my wife back for dinner."}
