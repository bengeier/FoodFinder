{"text":"This is the best Lebanese food in town by far. The chicken and hummus are to die for. The shawarma is juicy and everything is fresh!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place by far for lebanese food. Its fresh and cooked perfectly.

The portion are very big but if you take it to go it seems you get more than if you eat on site. 

Price are very good and the staff is amazingly friendly and helpful.

I go once a week and I never found anything to complain about. They also have a loyalty card.

They take credit cards and debit they have lots of room inside and outside"}
{"text":"Un accueil irréprochable, des produits de qualités, des portions copieuses, le tout pour un prix raisonnable. Une excellente adresse. Lors de mon prochain passage a Montréal, je ferais le détour sans faute. Bravo"}
{"text":"So I have had Mediterranean cuisine tons of times. But oddly enough I had not had Lebanese until a couple months ago in Berlin. This qualifies as my second time. 

The storefront keeps you expectations low. As you pull up nothing fancy or flashy. Walk-in same thing. Given that I waa pretty hungry the large menu of choices were a little overwhelming. I quickly asked the guy at the counter if there a plate of some sort that they offer with the spit fired chicken as the protein. He says yea no problem...rice, potatoes, salad...does that work for you? Simple enough. Paid for my food. Sat down. From the first bite I knew I was in for a treat. Supremely flavorful, fresh. NOTHING on the plate did not taste wonderful. My favs...

The chicken was tender, seasoned delightful and paired with the sauce awesome. The rice was not hard as you find some when they are buffet style. Fluffy and tasty. The potatoes and salad were quite good as well. 

Not sure why, but Atlanta is missing exactly this type of restaurant. Reasonably priced, delicious ethnic food (although we have some pretty good Thai and Mexican spots) without a ton of fake fanfare and praise. 

The meal cost me $13 CAD and they do take Visa/Mastercard. Would definitely be back if I were staying in the area. And by the way...I still love Greek food but have found in traveling...Lebanese, Turkish and Palestinian food to be even more flavorful. Who would have thought."}
