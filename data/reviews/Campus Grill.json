{"text":"This is a small 12 table diner style place that hits the spot every time!  Breakfast is your traditional fare at an excellent price!  Four pancakes, bacon and two eggs for around 6 bucks!  For lunch you can grab a Burger, Salad or Gyro all for under 5 bucks and that includes fries!   I only wish this place was open every day but the owners are also the Chefs so I guess they need a day off too.  Great little spot with great prices and great food."}

{"text":"Great little diner! Everyone is very friendly and they always make you feel welcome. Great gyros, sammiches, burgers, and breakfast food for really cheap! They're only open for breakfast and lunch though."}
