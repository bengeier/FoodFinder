{"text":"Yakiramen was a okay ramen place. The portion are really small. Order the pork belly and they were the size of your thumb and it only came with 4 pieces for $5, big rip off. My friends and I order the spicy miso soup and so did my friends. The portion wasn't that great, all you get one small piece of pork belly and one small piece of enoki. Very disappointing and speaking about the customer service, it was okay, the server and bartender have faces where they don't even want to work here and it had a awkward feels to it when we came in. Overall it's an okay experience. Only thing I be anticipating for would be the Korean BBQ they are opening up next door."}
{"text":"Amazing food! One of the best ramen spots I've ever been! I will definitely become a regular and drive the 30 minutes to get here!"}
{"text":"We were big fans of Sens back in the day and have dined at all of Johnny Chu's places since then, so we were thrilled to see him open up Yaki Ramen in our neighborhood. Knowing it takes awhile for new restaurants to find their groove we waited several weeks and finally took the plunge last weekend. Happy to see some of our favorites from Sens on this menu including bacon wrapped lychee...amazing! 
We filled up on a good selection of the grilled options so opted to share one ramen between the 2 of us. Loved that we got a full bowl of ingredients...not just broth.  Noodles and pork belly perfectly cooked, but the broth could have used a bit more depth of flavors, in their defense we opted for the traditional ramen, but they have several broth varieties that we'll try next time. Overall we enjoyed all of our food and cocktails. They have some great martini options. The service started out a bit rocky....mainly due to being busy and under-staffed, but they quickly recovered once more staff arrived to work. Enjoyed speaking to Johnny at the end of our meal. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood spot! Happy Hour til 7!! The small plates were amazing. Lychee wrapped in bacon. Chicken wings were so yummy! Gyoza comes out in a stem basket! Bar with beer on tap and Tito's!! I'll personally make sure this place makes it. 

And then comes the RAMEN! SO flavorful and on point. Perfectly cooked soft boiled egg. The pork belly was delicious! Noodles perfectly prepared. Doesn't get any more magical. Ambience was perfect for family dinner. Lots of outdoor seating for the cooler evenings. Pricing is good. 2 could easily eat for under $30. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  The broth cooks for 24 hours!  That's some serious care put into NOT JUST SOUP PEOPLE.  You must give this place a try its mind blowing amazing.  I had toncotsu, it was the best I have had in the states, reminded me of Okanowa.  Bre the bar tender is so amazing words can't describe her, personality, kindness, attentiveness and my oh my can she make a martini! Oh and try the Kobe beef skewers and the bacon wrapped quail eggs so good."}
{"text":"I wish I had photos of my dinner, but I ate everything so fast!  All the dishes I tried were delicious. The steamed dumplings, bacon wrapped cherry tomatoes, chicken wings and the Ramen with lemongrass  and pork belly.  I also enjoyed the bartender Anthony who was very friendly, personable, and funny. I look forward to my next visit hopefully this week!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time. Kobe beef skewers were perfectly grilled. We were a party of 3. Ordered spicy miso, red miso, and ma la ramen noodles. Flavors in each soup was perfect. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Best ramen so far in Phoenix. Love the basic ingredients. Highly recommended. The atmosphere is very chill."}
{"text":"The ONLY West Valley ramen place to go to. Met Chef Johnny Chu, the owner and his wife tonight. He explained that he cooks the authentic broth over 14 hours and uses top quality ingredients. Our table had three different styles of ramen and all of us agreed that we will be back soon.  Really great stuff. Yakitori is also cooked in the authentic Japanese style over the white coals. 

Restaurant has a super cool vibe with anime videos playing behind the bar. Owner is also the genius behind Shabu Fondue and Red Thai in midtown!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this new joint out as I've heard good things about it considering it's owned by Shabu Fondu, however my experience here left me unimpressed. We had ordered a few pork belly as an appetizer and when we received it, it was the smallest portion. Picture a strip of pork belly cut in half and then cut into smaller portions and served to you. It was literally two bites. The ramen had taken a while to get here as they had messed up on another tables order in which they disposed of the ramen in the trash can behind the bar. Customer service here was terrible. Our waitress was very dull and didn't ask if we needed anything at any point of our dining experience unless we asked ourselves. She wasn't enthusiastic or helped us with the menu. We waited 20 minutes for the tab as well. Wouldn't personally come back unless it was for their neighboring restaurant to be opened in September"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. When I first saw this place on Yelp I figured the address was wrong. This neighborhood has never been known for food and a trendy place like this was so unexpected.

Unfortunately my first time there on a Saturday afternoon found them closed with no visible hours. There  were already reviews on Yelp so I figured maybe they'd only had a soft opening. Nope, turns out they just have weird hours.

After trying to call today to confirm they were open for  dinner (no answer, generic voicemail) I ventured over anyway. Luckily they were open and I confirmed that the hours listed on Yelp are accurate. I had to add both the restaurant and the hours to Google Maps. 

The inside of the place is gorgeous and trendy so I had high hopes walking in. The menu is small and straightforward. I ordered tonkotsu ramen and asked if I could add extra pork. The waitress blinked and me and said \"Uhh, I guess we could do that\" like she had never heard of that before.

In general the two people working the front were both nice. I wish I had liked the ramen more but my first bite of noodles tasted undercooked so I pushed them down and let them sit for a few mins. Their noodles definitely taste like the egg noodles they are. The pork belly was unimpressive to me. The broth was good but not great.

Since it was 110 degrees outside and I was eating hot soup I would have appreciated a little more air conditioning than what they had going. I was happy to get back in my car and turn the AC on.

I'd like to say that I'll come back in a few months and see how they're doing but right now I'm not very excited about the thought."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! What a wonderful surprise, less than a mile from my home! I've wanted to try this place since it opened and my granddaughter agreed to come with me. Robert was our server and suggested the Tom Yam, which was deliciously flavorful. We also tried the crispy Gyoza with Ponzu Ginger sauce.....SO GOOD! My granddaughter said we have to get more than one order the next time we come. We had the steamed white rice and poured the leftover Ginger sauce over it...DELICIOUS! The lemon-pepper wings were delightful....no kidding! The Korean short ribs were good but I will probably be too busy trying new items. 
I'm in my 50's and was a bit skeptical considering the clientele seemed rather young and cartoons were playing on the wall. I didn't give it a second thought when our food came. Robert was very attentive and respectful. 
Oh, one more thing, there's a soft boiled egg in the ramen dish that was one of the best I've ever tasted! So surprisingly delicious! I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Very happy with the quality of food and service. The ambiance of this restaurant is enjoyable, three projectors playing an anime, and some upbeat music (played at just the right volume). Everything I ordered was wonderful, I will be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Really delicious.  I've had ramen a few times, this place is as good as ive ever had.  No complaints.   And they were playing giant anime on the back of the bar.   Very cool place.  Waitress was a little forgetful.  But overall. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese ramen bowls of noodles, pork belly, a soft boiled egg and shaved ginger. The portions are huge and the pork broth is amazingly rich. And the fried tofu appetizer is so silky, we both gobbled it up, and my husband doesn't even like tofu. This will be a regular for us.
It would be great if there was more than one person working the dining area. On a weekend, one person shouldn't be both the waitstaff and bartender."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out just because of the cool projectors they cast on the wall of the anime you can see driving by that's where it all stopped turns out anime running on the wall made me a little nauseous sitting at the bar but that's my problem not theirs didn't try in the ramen because they're all pork-based and I don't really eat pork that one vegan option but didn't sound too good so I had the beef short ribs and the mushrooms mushrooms were okay a little dry beef short ribs at a decent flavor but you would have to order at least four or five of them to get full a wife had the wife had the ramen Cicero's excellent she really loved it she also had their mango Martini I think she didn't finish it. It was gross service I thought wasn't a great girls very good at explaining everything and how it all worked after that never came around when you have asked for silver word couple times you know it's not going to be very good no drink refills nothing talk to order at a waiver down every time I needed something in the place was dead so might go back just for the ramen my wife and maybe I'll try the vegan one but not too sure"}
{"text":"Really good ramen. Pork belly was great. Cool sodas. We really liked the bar and the anime wall. Sound would have been cool. Really great experience. Only gripe was that the fresh wasabi was frozen. Kind of a bummer but it was still tasty."}
{"text":"Nice enviorment friendly bar tender and the noodles are excellent. If your feeling some ramen this should be your go to place"}
{"text":"Bland and watery. Won't be returning  ordered the shrimp wrapped in bacon and I feel like it was heat in the microwave. The additional star due to the server being nice."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. 

Service was lacking. Like other reviews mention, there are only two people working in the front of the house. This must be a common thing. We went on Saturday and had to wait, although not long. Once we were seated our server went over the menu quickly. We ordered and the food came out quickly. After that, we didn't see our server until we asked for the check.

The positive - The short ribs and the wings were pretty good. The edamame was a decent portion and the rice was cooked well, but both of those are pretty simple to not mess up. Oh,and the pesto ramen was super tasty and a good size as well. 

The negative - The ramen broth was so bland. I had the black garlic, my partner had the tonkotsu. I don't like sriracha so I was given chili oil and spicy sesame oil....they didn't do much. I added sriracha. Meh. The pork belly was tough. All ramen bowls are the same, the only thing that changes is the broth. I ordered hot tea and it never came. Luckily it wasn't on the bill so our server must have forgotten as soon as he walked away from our table.

Chances are I won't return. If I do it will only be to order that pesto ramen for takeout. Even with sub-par food, the lack of people working is what seals the deal. Lack of servers and attention equals poor customer service. Period."}
{"text":"This is the first ramen shop I've been into, and I'm a fan. Their Ma La ramen is my favorite there, followed by their Red Miso. The portions are huge and satisfying. It's an interesting place to eat at; there's anime playing on projectors and in low-lighting. 

Only downside is when I've been there, they are a bit slow to seat and serve you. I noticed that they seemed understaffed- last time I was there there was just the barkeeper and a waiter. But that doesn't take away from how good the food is!"}
{"text":"Was excited to give this place a try. However, I found the ramen to be a big letdown. They put corn in it; not something I've ever seen or heard of. On top of that, the noodles themselves were kind of tasteless, and the broth leaves a lot to be desired. However, they get stars for being such a clean establishment and for such friendly staff. If you're new to ramen, this place might be okay. But if you're familiar with how good ramen can be, don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of ramen. I have been to different places all over the world especially Japan. The ramen at Yakiramen is very good. I had tonkotsu ramen and the broth should have been a bit more richer. However, the toppings blended in well and hence, it was very delicious. The eggs were perfectly \"soft-boiled\" and I enjoyed every bite of it.  The price was very reasonable. The service was wonderful. I am giving this four star because I would want to see \"richer\" broth option, extra toppings option, and takoyaki be added to the menu. Please consider opening for lunch as well. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Opened in the past few days, and they've got their A-game already. Perfectly soft boiled eggs in slow cooked bone broth for their ramen. Delicious pork belly. Great variety. 

I had their Tom yam ramen - think of it as a chili-citrus flavor. Very reminiscent of Malaysia and Thailand.  Great flavor without being overwhelmingly spicy.

My daughter had the Tonkatsu - the benchmark ramen, and I must say, she too, was impressed. 

The only issue I have, and this is negligible at best, is that they don't offer different noodle choices for their soups. Some other resturants in town offer Udon and soba, and offering such would be rather pleasant."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in the area, and by that I mean it's pretty average because there no other ramens in the area. The toppings are excellent and probably why it's so expensive. Without the price tag, it's is definitely an above average place, they've got a good medium boiled egg and pork belly on almost every bowl, but the broths are definitely overshadowed by these toppings. In my opinion, I don't see ramen as a super fancy dish, so all fancy ingredients don't interest me as much as a good broth. The atmosphere puts off this chill hangout place but the prices make it hard to make regulars."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with the quality and quantity of the food you get for the cost. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was the service. The tall gentleman waitor, with the faux hawk, we had was awesome. He deserves 5 stars. However, the woman, w8th the glasses and bun, working with him was very rude and caused a seen because of closing tickets. There is a time and a place for constructive criticism, in front of customers it not it. I don't even want to call it constructive criticism because it was just down right uncalled for rudeness. I hope the guy working there knows his worth, because he was awesome. Hopefully the lady learns to control her temper, and learns the time and place for her attitude."}
{"text":"Not the best service. It's not even crowded and the bartender stopped open seating at the bar. Oh and they don't have rice at the moment."}
{"text":"Chef Johnny Chu is amazing! My daughter noticed this new ramen place near in the Moon Valley district. We went last night, and it was not a disappointment. The vibe is cool with anime being projected on the walls. We waited a while before we were seated even though there was no line. The place was packed, though, which was nice to see.

Yakiramen offers a selection of small plates and yakitori. We asked our server for a recommendation as far as appetizers. She said that the puffed rice, bacon wrapped lychee, kobe beef and pork tenderloin were delicious. We chose to go with the unusual grilled puffed rice with nori or seaweed, and the traditional tonkotsu ramen.

The grilled puffed rice was amazing! It had the hibachi smokiness, perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with sesame seeds. Now, it was tasty by itself, but the Yuzu soy dip with scallions.....OMG, I died and went to heaven.

Then came the ramen. Oh, the wafting scent of slow cooked pork and chicken broth was the base for this lovely dish. The noodles, although not made in-house, is a recipe created by Chef Chu and made in California. The noodles are served with corn, black fungus, enoki straw mushrooms, grilled pork belly (Danish pork melts in your mouth and with a delicious smoke) and the amazing coddled soft boiled egg. I forgot to add the in-house pickled red ginger strips that adds a fresh note to the rich assemblage. The broth flirts on a little too salty for my palette, but still, the robust combination is fabulous. I cannot wait to try the spicy miso based ramens. The egg makes the broth oh so creamy. They offer chili oil and a spicy sesame oil. I am a total fan of the spicy sesame oil with this particular ramen.

Chef Chu spent some time with us and talked about his love for asian fusion cuisine. I noticed that on the small plates, there were 3 dishes that included the use of truffle oil. I cannot wait to come back and try these offerings. I want to eat the Kobe beef yakitori and try another bowl of ramen. Chu recommends the Ma-La, a spicy szechuan inspired ramen. We are so grateful to discover another delicious restaurant in the West Valley!

Tip: Be mindful of the hours. We stopped by on a Friday afternoon trying to catch lunch, but we had to come back at 4 pm. Hours on Friday was from 4 pm - Midnight. But now, we know where we can do a Friday late night run!"}
{"text":"Strange early dinner tonight. We had to wait to be seated. Ordered gyoza and that was great.  I was suffering the after effects of a bad cold and a hot bowl of spicy ramen was in order.  We both ordered spicy miso ramen.  Neither bowl came with the pork belly as promised on the menu.  Ramen worked it's magic to make me feel better, but why no pork belly?"}
{"text":"Came in with family the other day. Great food and great service. Ramen bowl was very good and not too strong on the broth like allot of places. Loved that they show anime on the walls. Appetizers were great too, had a bacon wrapped thing that tasted great. Waitress was very nice and did a great job."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took my daughter wife and kids tonight to celebrate my daughter's birthday. 15 min wait was expected to be seated for a group of 6. What was not expected was never getting to order food or drinks while people that came in after us were able to order and get their food. Staff was more attentive to getting more water for the tables around us than taking our order. We waited 20 minutes after getting seated and finally walked out."}
{"text":"First of all eww! Service was lacking in every way possible. Food took a lot longer than expected meaning over an hour for chicken wings. The waitress was the least attentive in the history of attentiveness. Never asked us if we needed a refill. The food did not reach expectations especially considering the amount of time it took them to cook it. We had two ramen bowls and by the time the wings made it to the table we had to eat cold broth. Over all don't spend your hard earned cash at this spot."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for awhile since then opened a few months ago. They have an interesting setup for the restaurant. It's long and narrow with a high ceiling. There is a bar on the left when you walk in with booths and tables on the right. You are welcomed with three projectors showing anime (with no sound). They have some backgrounds music planting as well. 

The menu is straight forward and simple. There primary focus is definitely Raman and drinks which they seem to do fairly well at. Most items are moderately priced.

Their staff was nice and meet our needs.

It looks like they are preparing to open another restaurant that is connected to this one in October. They said it will be an all you can eat Korean BBQ with a DJ. This will be an interesting mix of restaurants.

This is a decent place to go get some ramen."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place after seeing the positive comments. Ordered the shrimp tempura small plate, which looked good but three pieces were cold in the center as if it wasn't cooked long enough. Husband ordered the grilled squid yakitori and that was good. We both ordered the Gangnam ramen. It looked good at first glance. Tried the broth first and it was good and mild. The ingredients went well with the broth but then tasted the noodles and it was very undercooked. The texture was as if they had just taken it out of the package and just dropped it in the hot broth and declared it complete. I'm not sure if they even cooked it beforehand. Disappointed and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Ramen was yummy. Came with some friends after finals and got the tonkatsu with ramen noodles. A few other people in my party got various ramen with udon noodles and they were very surprised. Staff was nice and service was okay! They have projectors on the wall which is awesome, but also a but disorienting haha. Overall a good vibe and good food options. There isn't any food on their happy hour menu, but drinks sound awesome. Trying their happy hour martini and a miso ramen is on the next list!"}
{"text":"Yum! Fun club re-mixes on the speakers, (a la Sophie-Ellis Bextor), anime on the screens, great selection of drinks and excellent food!  Super fast service and both ramen bowls ordered were delicious! I tried the tonkatsu ramen and my date had the Buddha bowl. I should have listened to my server and got his recommendation of the Tom yam ramen, but I already know I'll be heading back!"}
{"text":"I came in for ramen and hot tea after having pretty rough day of blood tests at the hospital. I was immediately greeted and seated shortly after. The atmosphere is very relaxed and comforting but the staff was efficient. The ramen was delicious! The most memorable part of my dinner was definitely the service Brittany provided. I told her about my difficult day and she was so kind and went out of her way to share some of her wisdom with me. Small things like that mean the most. The world needs more compassionate people like her. I will absolutely be back and I will tell my friends about my five star experience. Thank you Brittany, you made my day brighter."}
{"text":"We recently moved to this side of town and were so excited to try this place. When we walked in no one even greeted us but we  decided to sit and wait. There were 4 people trying to put together 1 table for a large party. The whole 15 minutes it took all 4 to put it together not one person smiled at us, told us they'd be right with us or even acknowledged our presence. We often consider giving it another go but the lack of respect this place has for customers is disgusting. Extremely disappointing and rude!"}
{"text":"Wow. So good. The gangnam ramen is the bomb. Only $11 for a big bowl. I think so cheap. This place is too nice to be that cheap.

The restaurant over all is awesome. Very clean. Good and fast service

Good music with fun Japanese cartoons project on the wall.

Pretty cool place to hang out for some good food."}
{"text":"the service is quick and that's about it. Our group of 4 tasted 4 different kinds of noodles. 3 of these 4 tasted exactly the same and all 3 were so spicy that it takes away whatever flavor the place was trying to create. Just overbearing. I like spicy food but the overkill on the spice just deprives us of any enjoyment. We don't really mind that the ramen is overpriced but to pay for something that just didn't cut it is food and money that was wasted. They need to diversify the taste profile of their selection of noodles. A big let-down."}
{"text":"It was national Ramen day, or so the Internet told me. So we decided to give this place a try. We sat up at the bar. Pretty cool vibe with the Anime being projected on the back of the bar wall, everything was sleek and simple. The bartender we had was really nice and really helpful. I can't remember the first thing I ordered but she informed me if I was looking for something with a deeper flavor to try the Red Miso. I took her advice and I am glad I did. The broth was still not as deep or rich of a flavor as I am use to in a Ramen so if this is the deepest, richest soup I'll take it. There were plenty of noodles and I really liked the corn that came in the soup, it gave it a bit of a sweet kick at times. But I will say there is something lacking for me. I would like to come back and try a few more things. I really like the people and the concept, I just wish the Ramen had a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"We had the Black Garlic it was ok. The broth saved it.  The Fried Tofu is excellent not the mushroom yakitori."}
{"text":"Ma La ramen was really delicious. The not too spicy peppercorns really compliment the flavor of the broth. The pork belly was really crispy and good. They seemed a little stingy when you asked for things like extra green onions though. Overall very flavorful and good ramen."}
{"text":"My whole party thought the ramen was disgusting. It was bland and left us feeling as if our money was wasted. The appetizers were okay though. I also didn't care for the service. The waitresses appeared disheveled and were only half dressed. Never coming back. Go to Tomo in Goodyear if you want great Ramen in the West valley."}
{"text":"I thought the Tonkotsu was delicious, but I'm not a ramen connesuir so I can't tell you how it compares to other places.  The broth was rich and flavorful, the pork belly sooo good, and the soft-boiled egg perfectly cooked. The egg was still chilly though, so maybe it could have been warmed a bit more in the broth. My SO got the Gangnam - very good, more spicy with kimchi flavor.  The restaurant has 2 names, Fire Belly Charcoal Grill and Yakiramen, which is confusing.  Only Yakiramen shows up here so maybe the back room will be Fire Belly when it opens? Anyway go eat there so it will stay open! I want to go back!"}
{"text":"I come there to enjoy great food and drinks by the best bartender in the world. Her name is Misty. She is amazing, professional, courteous everytime i visit. Thanks Misty for providing excellent service. You rock Misty!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We live in the area and have come to appreciate it for its amazing food, fun atmosphere, and welcoming staff. I have yet to leave dissatisfied. When we go I usually get the Red Kissed martini and the Tom Yam ramen bowl, both so flavorful and so satiating. The bacon wrapped quail eggs and the steamed Gyoza are both fantastic, too! Genuinely love this addition to the neighborhood and it's amazing cuisine!"}
{"text":"Pretty great for a phoenix ramen place. Nice setting especially with the anime projection. That added a cute atmosphere. I had the buddha bowl and it was pretty good and kinda spicy. The bowl was one of the better bowls ive had in this area. We went around 10 pm and it seemed like we were the only people there."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I had not had ramen before so I cannot compare to anything else. I ordered the black garlic ramen and shishito peppers."}
{"text":"Such a let down down! Thumbs down ... First of all had to wait to be seated only 2 people working and not busy at all... So you have to wait to be seated to be rotated in as they can serve you. We ordered appetizer of truffle edamame and tempura shrimp I enjoyed the edamame the shrimp tempura was underwhelming... My husband and I both ordered the Ramen soup and would like to remember which they were but since they were made with the same broth which by the way was not hot, the hard boiled egg was cold in the middle , the Ramen noodles were undercooked and spicy was not spicy (we had to ask for hot sauce) so the Ramens just had different toppings 
Miso sad :(  
 Hope they can get it together every restaurant deserves a chance but as far as we are concerned it's one and done for us!"}
{"text":"Since traveling a lot to California, I have always wanted and. Raved authentic Japanese ramen here in AZ. Eating in all the places here in AZ (mostly in the east side) and considering almost all to be garbage, this place is such a blessing. Authentic!!! Period no questions asked! The flavors are amazing! There's only two places in AZ for authentic ramen and this has took spot number one for me. It's in the west side, the location itself is amazing with the hip feel, anime playing in the screens, beer, the extras for the ramen. Thank you for finally coming to the westside! Don't even hesitate come through."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place. We've never had ramen before and Kyle, our server,  was very good at explaining everything.  From amazing appetizers to phenomenal ramen, factor in excellent service...this place has it all! We can't wait to come back and bring friends!!!!  We had 3 different appetizers and 2 types of ramen....amazing!!!  In 2 months they are opening individual grills with 27 different cuts of meat. Can't wait to try it!!!!!  We intend to be regulars."}
{"text":"This is a unique restaurant. it was close to Japanese style but we are in the U.S. so its as close as your going to get. Pork belly, was on or in everything I ordered not hating. Well if you miss Japanese food or want to try some stop by this place. I talked to 2 waiters and they were both very nice and helpful. the decor was projected manga \"Japanese cartoon\" which was cool. great service and good food equals a great day."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan. They're going to be opening up a Korean BBQ next door too soon, but that's an aside. 
As soon as you walk in you see three giant projectors playing anime, and a wide open bar space. The menu has a good variety of soup flavors, even though they're all the same base (tonkotsu or miso), and if u like spicy, I highly recommend the ma-la ramen. 
I've come here twice, and the food was great both times.
And if you're feeling adventurous, order the bacon-wrapped appetizers ;)"}
{"text":"Expect delicious & satisfying food but long wait times. 30 minutes waiting to be seated, 20 minutes waiting for our order to be placed, another 20 minutes waiting for our orders to come out (3 ramen) & another 30 to have our payment processed. They were understaffed - only 2 servers for a Saturday night. One of the servers was pretty apologetic about the wait times but the other made us feel like we should have apologized for making a visit at all. I would go back for the food but really hopeful for better service!

Update: went back on a Friday evening. Same quality of food & really great service!! I loved it :)"}
{"text":"Went with my fiancé and his parents we always like to go out and try different foods different cuisines this came up as a new location to try some Ramen. There's a place on in Tempe that we tried but just kind of been sit with us very well. Tried this walked in had a massive TV screen playing all kind of different anime shows, on the menu was very good the service and they're obviously knew what type of food they were serving which is nice because if you have any questions they definitely know how to explain to you the different styles of Ramen. Very far price, very easy-going definitely a good place to go if somebody's like a big Ramen/anime fan."}
{"text":"The staff was great and I will say, I'm not really a fan of ramen but.. it was tasty..The staff more than made up for my lack of interest I. Ramen"}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in to have dinner since we always drive by and she sees anime on their big screen. The bartender/waitress looks at me and says, \"You might want to sit down, it's going to be a while, as she's sitting a couple that came in before us. No, Hi welcome to Yakiramen. 10 minutes later we get a table and are brought water, the waiter didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink and didn't ask what type of noodles we wanted. He only came by our table 3 more times, once to drop off more water, to drop off our food and to drop off the check and he did not say one word during the whole process. What a strange way to run a business. The ramen was okay, not something I'd return for. I'll definitely be making the drive out to Tempe for Republic Ramen more often."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE: you don't get what you paid for with these outrageous prices... the broth was very salty and their was barley any noodles in my bowl... 12$ for what? Your basically paying for their Netflix account because they show anime from a Netflix account YAKI RAMEN?? More like YUCKY RAMEN"}
{"text":"Incredibly nice staff in an awesone ramen bar that is uber-cool. 3 projectors play Japanese anime behind the bar with the staff curating a great selection of music. 
Fantastic ramen with great, small plates of tasty Yakitori also on the menu. Decent selection of sake, plus craft beer, wine & full bar with signature cocktails also on the menu. 
A great, cool place that's been needed on the Westside for quite some time!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting a ramen place and I am glad we did! Our waitress Misty was so helpful. We will definitely return next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of Johnny Chu's Red Thai restaurant on 16th St. We finally made it over to Yakiramen in hopes of finding a rich brothy ramen house. Unfortunately my wife and I were very underwhelmed with the entire experience. The Tomkatsu lacked depth, creamy and smokiness. Pork belly was meh, egg cold and ramen noodles were clumped together as if was sitting in a colander for some time. My Black Garlic broth was ok but also lacked depth, had a very small piece of pork belly with a cold egg and clumped noodles. We'll be sticking with the Pho Thai soup at Red Thai moving forward but hoping Johnny can straighten things out here."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out but was very disappointed. Not sure why this place has 4 stars. I came with my family. The entrance smelled like sewer. Floor was dirty. Glasses had water stains. I was reminding myself that maybe, the food would be good. We ordered the tonkotsu ramen. Noodles were stuck/clumped together. It was a bit bland. Soup was not hot enough. Asked the waitress if the noodles were supposed to be like that. She then says 'noodles are cooked for three minutes and are on a timer.' There were only two servers for about 8-10tables. I feel bad writing this review since they just opened but I hope the owner reads this and does something about it."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this restaurant since it's opened. Left highly disappointed. $5 for 4 pieces of pork belly that are nearly one inch. The ramen itself is skimpy on nearly everything that's given. It came with a small bundle of enoki, ONE piece of the smallest pork belly, but I must say the egg was cooked very nicely. Almost every other place I've been has given a couple pieces of pork belly... not just one. I got spicy miso ramen, but wasn't spicy at all... would rather drive a further distance for a better spot. All employees seem uninterested. The food took forever to come out, even though it was nearly empty inside. I hope the service and the food will get better."}
{"text":"Arizona has been plagued with a ramen deficiency since the dawn of man. Countless restaurants with delusions of grandeur have attempted to free our wasteland from this tonkotsu drought, but we were merely left with watery miscarriages by the likes of Ramen Republic.

Alas, YakiRamen has arrived to ease our weary souls, residing in a really fucking weird part of Phoenix that nobody has ever heard of. 

Geo-roasting aside, this place has the best ramen in town. YakiRamen is right at home with the mom-and-pop izakayas of LA's Little Tokyo district. What it lacks in stuffy, traditionally bland Shio, it makes up for with bold, unexpected flavors. Unlike most hyper-authentic ramen stops, YakiRamen is tame enough for the in-laws; There's no shrimp heads or I-double-dog-dare-you-to-eat-that-thing-esque ingredients. Admittedly, I'm bummed by the lack of variety in meats and good ol' naruto, but I know Johnny'll think up some crazy way of incorporating chicken, beef and fish.

TL/DR: IT'S LIT FAM"}
{"text":"Chill place. I like how they have anime on on the screen but to me it seems a little weird because you would be watching anime but listening to something else. Just didn't flow. I like the service, the waiter was very helpful and responsive. 

I tried the tom yam flavor, recommended. Personally I didn't like it that much. It was a weird combination. I was tasting hot pot flavors but was expecting ramen. I did like the portions. There was a little bit of everything. I wished there was more pork belly though. I was tryingto ration it with the amount of noodles. The pork belly itself was also different. It tasted like they grilled it instead of the tradition method. It was different and I was open to to it. 

Price: $$
Appearance: 5/5
Service: 5/5

{"text":"Grilled squid is the business! Gyoza is solid. The ramen is fantastic. I had red miso, my husband had black garlic and his was better. No kids menu, but our picky eater chowed down on the plain broth and noodle bowl. 

Service was a little slow but it wasn't super busy and we didn't wait unreasonably long. I would have staffed it at the same level for the traffic we saw."}
{"text":"Great first time experience, customer service was simply exception and I was welcomed courteously regardless of my visiting at the eleventh hour. All my questions were answered, and I was never pressured to order immediately. Anime playing on their wall was a nice experience. The seating was perfectly arranged to allow a good sight of the projections regardless of where you sat, and with absolute clarity within all their projectors. It was rather impressive to get that resolution at that scale. I ordered the spicy miso and it was ready before I knew it, not sure if I lost track of time watching the show or what, but either way I was happy with the wait despite being excruciatingly hungry. Water was provided almost immediately, to which was rather delicious (I do appreciate good tasting water at restaurants). The portion of soup was of the perfect amount to share with my wife, and everything was provided to accommodate me sharing my bowl. The ambiance, I found was to my liking, especially with the dim lighting, I felt quite comfortable enjoying my food. I had a awesome first experience and I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I have been spoiled by other ramen shops, as this place left something to be desired:
There was too much ginger... all I could taste was ginger.
I would have expected a slightly heavier broth, one that was tended to for several hours to reduce and concentrate its flavors...this tasted like it was prepared within an hour. Furthermore, I expected more noodles in the served portion. Virtually every item in the dish reminded me of packaged vegetables, frozen and in a bag, rather than them being fresh, though technically there was no boast regarding \"fresh\"...so perhaps this is on me.

On several occasions I have made my own ramen and have fine tuned it's balance, though obviously to my own personal taste. However, if this is something that can be accomplished in ones home, and for less cost, surely a restaurant could do better.

I will return, as I have yet to try everything on the menu. I may have come in on a bad day...Establishments are entitled to those once in a while. The place has such potential.
I will try everything, and hopefully I will change my opinions."}
{"text":"The ramen was meh. My husband and I weren't fans of ours. We also got the shishito peppers and they were pretty good"}
{"text":"The restaurant seemed very nice from the outside and once you get inside but upon looking at the menu it doesn't take Long to notice that all of the soups have the same ingredients very bland flavor and a complete waste of time and money


 Do yourself a favor and don't come here they'll be closed in six months for sure"}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday for dinner. I was a little confused finding the place because the sign on the building is for a grill, but it's also the ramen place. For what appeared to be a slow evening, it seemed odd that we weren't seated or acknolwedged right away. It's nice that they put the water down before you even get to the table, but it seems like an unnecessary service because it just feels like you're waiting to be seated for no reason.

That being said, the service was okay. The waitress was friendly and helpful. She did offer to go over types of ramen, etc. We ordered three drinks and unfortunately she didn't remember to bring one of them until the end after I'd already eaten. To be fair, I never asked her about it when she came to check on us, so it's safe to say that it didn't both me much and she apologized. 

The ramen itself was good. The broth was tasty, but to be honest, between the 3 different types of broth we tried, it didn't really taste much different. One was just spicier than the others. Also, the chili oil and spicy sesame oil they provide doesn't really add spice. I think it's have to dump the entire little bottle in before it made any difference. That being said, the grilled pork belly was nice and quite tasty, but they only give you one slice. That was disappointing compared to other ramen places I've been to.

Overall, I'd give 3.5 stars, but rounded up because the waitress was nice. I'd come back again, however, this place wouldn't be my first choice to take someone visiting me. It's good enough to satisfy a craving though."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but it was a disappointing experience. We were a larger party and the \"soft boiled\" eggs arrived hard boiled, for all 7 orders. The broth was pretty mediocre and the pork belly was on the small side and was pretty chewy. The establishment was also on the dirty side and the outside patio is made up of dirty looking furniture and is surrounded by loud traffic, as well as lots of back and forth foot traffic, probably due to the Ross next door. There are much better Ramen places around."}
{"text":"Same owners as shabu fondue in Scottsdale. Ramen was delicious & pork belly, service was fast & super friendly. Ambiance was perfect! Will be back for sure! Can't wait till September for the grand opening of the Korean BBQ next door. Fire belly grill house."}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful place to eat. Great food and great service. Food tasted awesome. I have been to Japan and it was as good as it was in Japan. Just come and try it!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight to a nearly deserted restaurant. Our party was large but overall we did not have a complex order. Our appetizers took about an hour to finally receive finishing everything.  We ordered only a few different ones, yuzu pork belly(extremely small portion...4 1\" square pieces of pork belly for $5!) Chicken wings, which were the ones to take so long, we ordered 8 orders and received half after about 30 minutes. The other half arrived after we were nearly done with our ramen. They had no flavor, all i could taste was charred chicken.

On to the main course.. the ramen. 
All of the broth we tried was very WRONG. 

Tonkotsu ramen
The epitome of what many consider to be ramen, tastes nothing like I have ever tasted at any ramen place. Bland and uninspired. Noodles undercooked. Pork belly burnt. Not enough soup in the bowl, toppings short of making a wholesome bowl. 

Spicy miso ramen

The same review as you see above stands for this ramen. It was hard to even sense any flavor added from the miso,  in fact it didn't even appear to be a different soup from the tonkotsu at all!

Tom Yam

All of the above stands for this ramen. Only order this if you absolutely LOVE the taste of lemongrass. As that is all you will ever taste out of this ramen.

Gangnam ramen.

Supposedly a Korean ramen. Again, noodles undercooked. Not a single piece of kimchi in the soup,  despite it being listed as an ingredient. In fact, i'd wager that no kimchi was used at all in the production of this soup. It tastes like they pour a little cholula into their Tonkotsu and call it good.

Now let's hit on some drinks. The selection is extremely poor for a Japanese restaurant. Only a few offerings available that are japanese. And the price, wow. $9 for a large Asahi. It's sad to report that the Asahi was the best tasting item served at this restaurant. I was really hoping for something good to finally be in the phoenix area, but those hopes are dashed."}
{"text":"Review is closer to 4.5 stars.  They knocked it put of the park with their spicy miso.  The broth is great, the noodles are probably the best ramen noodles I had in Phoenix.  Low on the meat, but that isn't the star here.  The egg however was dropped a bit.  It was still cold and a bit over cooked for how custardy a ramen egg should be.  Definitely a place to try out to compare to your other ramen shops."}
{"text":"So good!!!! Love seeing the west side get some authentic and friendly businesses. Ramen was the best I've had in Arizona period and the service was absolutely excellent. Can hardly wait to go back - so much flavor and depth! They care and it shows."}
{"text":"Ok, this restaurant  is great!  The food is fabulous, the atmosphere is decent, the service??? Usually, the service is great. There is this one waitress name Brittany. First, she could not figure out how to place my order in the computer. I watched other people get their food before me. When she told me what happened, I told her I was on a time crunch. She immediately turned around and voila!!! My food arrived! Then I made a short statement as to why i needed my food quickly.  Brittany said \"oh, you made it seem like it was something grand\".  I do not believe my reason is up to her to decide what is grand and what is not grand. What a dumb move for a waitress!? Well, once the fabulous meal was over, she stole what change I had. She probably knew she was not going to get tip. Owners of Yakiramen, do yourselves a favor and get rid of that waitress. Brittany will make you lose customers for sure! I would have given 5 stars, however Brittany's service is subpar and I will not be returning until she is gone. I will be sure to tell my company about her as well."}
{"text":"I really really wanted this place to be awesome.  But as you can tell it fell a bit short.  First the positives...great environment and the simple menu make ordering and service quick and easy.  I love the decor and music...not what you expect from this part of town...which is why I was hopeful.  
But reality set in, not long after arriving.  There was limited staff...the poor guy was doing everything by himself....getting drinks, taking orders, bringing the food, fulfilling requests for condiments/extra napkins, bartendering, taking payment. He was super helpful and nice...thankfully.  Which was a sharp contrast to who I believe is the owner or manager, this woman who looks like she doesn't want to be here at all.  She gives everyone the stink eye [even customers] and in no way offers to chip in...as you see that level of staff do, especially in new businesses.  
Now the food....we got ramen and the quail eggs..the eggs were good. The broth of the ramen was clean and tasty, the noodles on the other hand were under cooked...they shouldn't zig zag.  Another minute or two they would have been perfect...so this is fixable.  I really hope this place survives...fingers crossed."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The chef came out to greet us and made sure our tasty food was great! I recommend this place to everyone! Our 16 month old enjoyed the noodles as well!"}
{"text":"Great service, food, and ambiance! Recommend it to anyone looking to have some tasty ramen."}
{"text":"We tried it and we enjoyed it.  The service was the best and the food was too.  Great atmosphere if you like anime!  I have recommended this place to friends who have also liked it!"}
{"text":"Every time my bf and I would drive by we would always be like we will come here eventually and we finally did. The anime on the wall is what drew us in, we wish that the audio was playing or even subtitles would have been cool but the ambiance is pretty laid back; they do play music.The food was okay, they had a couple vegetarian ramen options which is always great but for me I was not really a fan. The service was good and it was clean as well. But overall it was an okay experience."}
{"text":"The latest Johnny Chu installment of his culinary mind. We've been following this talented guy around the Valley since he opened Sens (we weren't quite there for Fate). The all-wall anime over the bar seems to be a trademark for his establishments. The bar is well-stocked with the same ingredients his restaurants are known for when it comes to craft libations. Lots of infused vodka, exotic fruits and savory herbs to choose from. 
The small plates are interesting and well presented. We had the gyoza dumplings and bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms to start. Both were quite tasty. For our entrees we had the Ma La (a lightly spicy Szechuan broth) and the black garlic ramen bowls. 
Can't wait for them to open the other side of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The best ramen in the West Valley. I had the Tonkatsu and the wife had the Spicy Miso ramen. They were both good and agree that we have found the best ramen place since moving here from New York."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem I found on the west side is worth the drive from anywhere in town. Modern vibe and great food. Wait staff very friendly and attentive. 
Martini's anyone?"}
{"text":"Thought we would try something \"new\" . I would not recommend this restaurant. Service was terrible. We waited for ever for our food. Overpriced ."}
{"text":"Trendy Japanese restaurant did not disappoint! Was greeted by a friendly waiter. The vibrant decor was exciting. Huge walls projected japanese anime! You can tell the owner has pride in his restaurant. Ordered appetizer braised short rib.  Amazing! Next was the Ramen. Good stuff. Ive been to a few Japanese restaurant s in Phoenix. I gotta say kudos to the chef. Flavors are one point. The awesome blend of spicey and lemon in my ramen was perfect. The broth of the ramen was cooked again with love. I would gladly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Huge ramen fan and couldn't wait for this place to open. I mean, a ramen restraunt right down the street!  Such a disappointment! I think the anime showing on the walls is what attracts the crowds because it's definitely not the food. Seriously,  go to Cherry Blossoms. It's worth the extra drive!"}
{"text":"Service was not so great. 3 people working, maybe 4 to 5 patrons, and the bartender kept chatting with the girl sitting beside us.

Broth was not flavorful and the meat portions we're fairly stingy.

To get to the bathroom, you basically have to walk through a dusty, worn down storage area.

Place seemed to be stuck between being a nerdy place, with anime being broadcast on the wall, a ramen shop, or a generic bar. It seemed like generic bar was winning out."}
{"text":"Good Ramen, Great Drink Selection, Great spot to Enjoy anime and the staff is friendly"}
{"text":"I've been to no more than 15 ramen restaurants. This is at the top. The atmosphere is so welcoming and friendly, so happy and cheerful. The lighting is perfect, the anime, the drinks, and staff. 

We will definitely be back. We absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Great ramen, cool anime, trendy spot in a very untrendy part of town!"}
{"text":"Not a bad little joint. Ramen was good, flavorful broth and plenty of ingredients. Staff was friendly and the service time was acceptable. I had the \"Kobe beef\" skewers and they weren't bad, but I can assure you they were NOT Kobe beef. All in all a decent night out, but probably will not return. It is a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Horrible service! One chick at the bar & one guy as a server. Handful of people there and you could obviously tell waiter was doing coke in the back. He had all the white stuff on his nose and kept sniffing. Even the couple at the bar could tell. He was very lazy and made it very clear he didn't want to be there. Food was a 7 out of 10. I've had better Ramen else where. I really wanted to like this place since it's so close to home, but the service made me never want to go back. Oh and I did go before this time, but with a handful of people there (again) and the same waiter being lazy. He never sat us just kept walking by and saying \"Give me a sec\" I walked out and told myself I  would give it another try and I did (hence the review) :("}
{"text":"The food was incredible. To start we had the bacon wrapped cherry tomatoes on the small plate menu and gyozu. We had the tonkatsu with ramen egg noodles. It was savory and super hearty, I haven't had anything like this in the Phoenix area so it's refreshing to see a diverse menu like this

The service however wasn't as great. Tables were not bussed for over 45 minutes, so we just had to look at 3 tables with dirty plates the entire time we were there. 

The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is unique with the 3 large projections of anime and the music was fun. I would recommend to a friend, but at the same time I will cross my fingers that they hire a bus boy."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!!! The udon and ramen are the best I've had, tried the black garlic and loved it. We could not finish our bowls, great servings. Our waiter Kyle was exceptional too. Will be back and can't wait for their next door steel drum bbq place to open! So happy the west side is getting better restaurants like this one!"}
{"text":"This place is so chill, you get to sit at the bar and watch anime that is projected all over the wall. Bartenders were great too. Lost a star for me because their broth was extremely salty. I've been there twice and it was the same each time... good for consistency though. I live close to here so planning to come back regardless and especially excited for when they open up their japan BBQ!"}
{"text":"Small menu which makes picking food easy.  The food is delicious.  My fave is their tonkatsu ramen and pork belly appetizer!  2nd time here so glad there's finally a ramen shop on this side of town.  Only 4 stars... Cups and dishes are very badly water stained  which kinda makes it less appetizing."}
{"text":"First , this is a very small place with a bar the length of the room and tables on the other side. That being said, the wait staff is small as well which is totally normal for a place that has maybe, 6 tables and a bar. I went on a Friday night, two servers, not too busy. I didn't have to wait to be seated. There was a good indie vibe from the music which is what you want for a trendy ramen spot. I enjoyed the vibe on the west side of town! I got the Ma La ramen which I was forewarned is spicy but the server personally didn't think spicy enough. It was spicy enough for me!! When it came time to drink the broth I was choking slurping it down. It was a perfect, filling portion for a meal and reasonably priced because of the trend associated with it. I would recommend this spot for a bowl of comfort anytime."}
{"text":"Sat for 25+ minutes and we didn't even get asked for our drink order. Got up and left! Party of 6 and we were completely ignored."}
{"text":"This small place offers a unique experience for ramen eating anime fans. The menu is simple - not much for gluten free options though. The service was quick and attentive. No worries on viewing the show. The are three large projections up on the wall for optimal viewing."}
{"text":"I love this place , I live nearby and it has yummy  drinks and ANIME projected on the wall behind the bar !! Sorry but just for those two things they Rock ! the Ramen is good, the Pork Belly and the spare ribs delicious :) The staff are really cool people, in the end I really like this place.  oooooh and did I say they have ANIME projected on the wall , sorry I had to say that again!! That took them to 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Been waiting to go to this place for awhile and finally did. I must say I was impressed with the good. We got the Red Miso and the Gangnam Ramen bowls with the udon noodles and they were really good. We also got the bacon wrapped enoki mushroom and the fried Chicken, also very delicious. Before I went in I was reading some of the reviews on google and here on yelp and was kinda hesitant but then I was like fuck it. I'll just go create my own opinion. They do have a happy hour that's starts at 4pm- 6ish. They do have a big drink menu compared to their food menu, so it shouldn't take you to long to chose your dish of choice.  It would be good to get a starter as the ramen take awhile as they prepare them when you order. Reasoning behind the 4 stars and not 5 is that it was VERY warm in the restaurant, and the cleanliness of the window seals wasn't all that. I'm not to fond to eat with dead bugs on the window seal staring at me as I enjoy my meal. But other than that. I would say this is a pretty damn good place to chill (or sweat since they don't use air conditioning I don't think) and get your RAMEN on!!"}
{"text":"I heard some good things about this place and decided to give it a shot.
I got the Ma-La Ramen and the Sweet & Spicy Chicken wings.
The Ma-La Ramen tasted like the ramen noodles you get at the store. It wasn't spicy like the menu indicated, the egg was tasteless and too watery.
The Sweet & Spicy chicken wings were okay for the price, but they weren't spicy nor sweet.
This place has cheap quality food and over priced. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend going here unless they paid me to eat here."}
{"text":"I was having such an awful night and my boyfriend convinced me to go out to this place that I have been checking out for a while. I am so glad that I did. The food was amazing, the drinks were on point, and the service was just phenomenal. All the servers were amazing and Anthony caught our hearts and taste buds with his drinks and stories. He made an amazing drink called the beast which everyone needs to try immediately. There is a wall of anime on display with very good music in the background to capture all crowds... That pork belly though... to die for!"}
{"text":"After have no tried several ramen places in town, I believe this is now my favorite. The ramen is very flavorful. The meat is charred nicely and the egg was cooked perfectly. I think my favorites are the Tom Yam & the Ma La. 

Tonite we were there & the noodles were just a bit to al dente for my husband. So they remade his soup with the noodles cooked just a bit more.

We had the Red Kiss martini & it was great. They infuse their own vodkas."}
{"text":"The best Ramen in AZ is here! The broth is thick and full of flavor, complimenting the noodles. Pork belly was seared to perfection. You will not find the great variety of toppings, but the end result will leave you craving more."}
{"text":"This place has excellent service and delicious ramen options as well as diverse and mouth watering appetizers. I recommend the bacon wrapped quail eggs, short rib, bacon wrapped lychee, and any ramen option. Tonkotsu and black garlic are sure winners."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been so disappointed that I even wanted to bother to write a review. We came here after work and it was one of the only ramen places open near us, so we decided to stop in. 

First off, I want to say that the waitress we had was very nice, and I appreciated her effort and care.

On to the food. We got five things: Truffle Edamame, Fried Tofu, Steamed Gyoza, Tonkotsu Ramen, and the Black Garlic Ramen. 

The Edamame were a suggestion by the waitress and I enjoyed them. The Fried Tofu was also very good, not too heavy and came with a sauce that was almost reminiscent of Thai peanut sauce in a way. The gyoza were poorly made, and fell apart in our chopsticks. More like soup dumplings if anything.

The worst was the ramen. Right off the bat I noticed it lacked the usual cloudiness and 'creamy' look that Tonkotsu normally has, reminded me more of beef consommé than anything. I shrugged and gave it a chance anyways. Gave just the broth a sip from the spoon and tasted a whole lot of nothing. Both broths were VERY bland, I'm talking Maruchan has more flavor kind of bland. I almost just asked for salt, which I have never done before when it comes to ramen. Oh well, let's try the egg... Both our eggs were cold in the middle. Okay, well the pork is for sure going to be good right? I was expecting soft, fatty, and rich. Took a bite of the pork, couldn't actually bite it it was so tough, I had to pull so hard to get a piece off that I couldn't hold it tight enough with my chopsticks and had to rip it with my fingers. The noodles were fine, but not enough to change my mind about the whole mess.

We both took approx. four bites of our ramen and sent it back with valid complaints, the waitress seemed genuinely disappointed that we didn't like it but only refunded us back a 30% discount, which only covered one of the bowls of ramen. That also disappointed us. 

All in all: poor main attraction, expensive drinks, crazy disappointment.
Don't bother with Yakiramen, just go to Nishikawa."}
{"text":"Not the best Ramen in Phoenix, but the best we've had in NW Phoenix. The Ma La and Gangnam Ramen were very good. The amount of meat was on the small side but very tasty. Both broths and noodles were excellent and on par with ramen we have had in Asia.  Service was good and fast. Decent selection of draft beer for happy hour. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best ramen spot in AZ. Welcoming and attentive staff. Great pricing. Yummy appetizers. Fantastic wide selection of ramen broth. You also have the choice of choosing regular ramen or udon noodles."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. Spicy miso ramen had an above average broth and a 'just right' kick with tasty ingredients. Korean short rib yakitori was the star, smoky and delicious. Crispy guitar far above average. Anime entertainment is different. Korean BBQ next door opening soon. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Worth what you pay for. The environment is really nice and it's just a chill place to have some good food and hang with friends or family."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious ramen! Met Anthony, and he was very knowledgeable and directed me to the Tom Yum.  Loved the lemongrass and the pork belly in the soup had a lovely grilled flavor. We also had the bacon wrapped quail egg and, truffle edamame...winners on both accounts!  This was a fun place to visit, and I know we will be back! Thanks Anthony and thanks to your wonder chef!"}
{"text":"The ramen was really good. I enjoyed the broth a lot, the poem was good. Excellent service
Was provided."}
{"text":"I love ramen. I have had ramen all over the valley (and in Japan) and this ramen was not up to par. I was excited to try a new ramen restaurant and had been waiting for it to open. I liked that their ramen comes with many of the toppings I would generally order as add on items (kikurage mushroom, egg, corn, etc). The tonkatsu ramen was on the cheaper side (9$) which I appreciated. Unfortunately, the broth was lacking in flavor. Additionally, when I asked if they could make it spicy to add flavor....if they had any spicy sauce or anything they said all they had was chili oil and togarashi. These are fine, but all the togarashi in the world wouldn't have spiced up this bowl. We also had gyoza, which were tasty, though not as awesome as the soup dumplings they had at sochu house back in the day (I know they're two totally different things....just wishful thinking). Also the service was lacking.... I had  one cup of water which was apparently enough because I never got a refill. Sadly, I won't be rushing back here for the ramen."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The ramen does not compare to any other authentic place I've been to in the SF Bay area, but I still like this place. They play anime on the walls and have a huge bar top. Service has been great each time we've gone. (We mainly come here because it's so close to home and we have yet to find any decent ramen close by) The food itself is probably about 3 stars (broth is sort of bland, noodles are decent), but they do have some interesting combinations."}
{"text":"3rd time I've been here, Really tasty ramen.. Fried tofu it's really good as well. Nice selection of sake which is a good thing"}
{"text":"Only Pork options. Got a chance to visit here and just had an Orange Cream mango soda. All their soups contain pork broth. Not much for vegetarians or people who don't eat pork."}
{"text":"I have been here more than a couple times, and I love it. Every type of ramen and appetizer I've had from here has been fantastic. Staff has always been friendly and helpful when I have a hundred questions! 
The absolute only thing I wish was better, is that they had more meat options, as well as include more meat in each order. Even with that, I will always return."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Their pork belly is to die for! We ordered a tonkatsu ramen and it was soo good! Broth was delicious and noodles just perfectly cooked. We also tried the quial eggs and they were fenomenal. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Couldn't have been happier with the experience I had here. Sat at the bar where our server was incredibly personable and we'll-informed. The environment is pleasing, with the projection wall making for an impressive visual display. We ordered the truffle edamame, sweet potato fries, and crispy gyoza as appetizers. The edamame was more than perfect, and the Sriracha sauce that came with the fries completed the perfect pair. Following the appetizers, we ordered the tofu/veggie ramen (I forget the name) and the Tom Yam ramen. Typically I am left unsatisfied with the quantity of noodles in one bowl, but this bowl came with more than enough noodles, perfectly cooked egg and pork belly, and veggies. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The only reason this is a 4 not a five is the lack of protein in the ramen. Pork belly is the only meat protein. The flavors of the chicken/pork broth are incredible. The mushroom variety is great taste for the pallet. The restaurant is clean and staff was great. The 3 large projectors on the wall were an interesting focal point."}
{"text":"It's not a good ramen place. Ramens not good. Half the stuff in it wasn't good, poorly made and bad texture too it. The two types of mushroom they put in all the soups were rubber like. 
Staff is nice. The menu was not well made, it looked like they have more to over but they don't. It's basically do you want tonksu. Ok these are 4 types because each type different flavor shot. But same ingredients. My app short rib was burnt. Rice looked nice but was dry. Meh. Go else where. Unless you like hipster looking places with sub par food but pretty decent service"}
