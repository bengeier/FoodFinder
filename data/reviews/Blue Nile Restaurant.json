{"text":"My rating might be a little bias because this was my first Ethiopian food experience. However, I have eaten my good share of Indian and Asian variety foods and I can honestly say that if all Ethiopian food is as good as the Blue Nile Restaurant, I'm completely in love! My friend mentioned that she lived with a man from Ethiopia who would cook her authentic Ethiopian meals just like the dishes we ate at the Blue Nile. We had ordered the meat variety platter and the vegetarian platter. I couldn't decide which I like better! Everything tasted so wonderful! Our waitress was super friendly and had a very sincere and genuine attitude. Great service.   The ambiance of the restaurant was perfect as well. Great lighting, marble table tops, gorgeous decor! Also, the prices were very fair. Five of us ate the two platters and only paid around $8 each (including tip!). I am definitely marking this place as my top favorite restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at plenty of Ethiopian restaurants and must say this is one of the best in North America(yes this includes the States). When I'm in Canada again, I will make an effort to visit this place again and will bring my coworkers. Make sure you try the beef tibis and veggie plate."}
{"text":"I went to the Blue Nile because of the reviews. I do not live anywhere near there. I thought the veggie platter was delicious. My daughter wanted some meat so we added Beef Tibbs to our platter. The injera was very good and as I said the veggies and pulses were yummy. I thought the beef, though was really greasy and I have to say it turned me off. I have been eating Ethiopian food for years in Toronto, dating back to when the Queen of Sheba opened out at Bloor near Dufferin. Remember that? Overall I recommend it if you live nearby, but not for a special trip to Danforth east."}
{"text":"I went to Blue Nile on Saturday night with a couple of friends. We were wandering the Danforth and decided on Ethiopian since two of us had never had it and we were definitely in the hood and mood to try. While walking we saw Blue Nile.  The gorgeous, edison lighting was a definite factor that drew us in.  It looked quite upscale and the atmosphere was so cozy. Blue Nile didn't disappoint.  The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was really nice.  We went with recommendations from the waitress and had a variety veggie/meat platter since we are Ethiopian novices.  Everything little dish was unique and flavourful and the spice level was not too high (for our weak stomachs)   The service was very friendly (if not polished).   A couple of things that were a little off.  There is a cocktail list but the waitress didn't know what a whiskey sour was or how to make it.  A little odd since it's on the menu.   Also, we told our waitress we were going outside to keep our friend company while she had a cigarette.  When we came back, our half empty glasses had been cleared.  When we brought this up another round was dropped at the table...it took 15 minutes but the correction was appreciated. All in all, we had a very nice meal in a cozy atmosphere with a round (and a half of drinks).  The best part...the bill came to $50!!!! We were happy to leave $75 and will be back again."}
{"text":"Just ate at Blue Nile for the second time and the food was fantastic again. Everything we ordered was delicious. We highly recommend trying this place if you feel like having Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Definitely recommended! The veggie platter is delicious. The place has friendly vibe, great service and perfect for the summer with a front patio. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is another fine Ethiopian restaurant on the Danforth; my friend Mark and I tried it last night.  Those of us who love Ethiopian food and who live close to the Danforth are truly spoiled for choice.  One of the great things about trying the many different Ethiopian restaurants along the Danforth is that each one has its own vibe and its own take on the familiar dishes such as the vege combo.  So what sets Blue Nile apart?  For starters I felt like it was a little more upscale inside.  This is not a dig against other places because sometimes you want a more homey, casual feel.  There is a bit more lighting here--I have often noticed that Ethiopian restaurants create a sense of intimacy and mystery with lower levels of interior lighting.  We went with the usual veggie platter and there were two standout dishes on it besides the usual (very delicious) suspects.  One was a dark cabbage or something that had a sweet taste to it.  The other was a dark mushy texture but that comprised of large beans and also had a sweet taste.  Again, everything on the platter was wonderful and pretty much you can expect when you order a veggie platter.  My friend mentioned that only one of the items had much spice to it.  My friend also pointed out that the injera was made with a whole wheat, not bleached, flour.  We were able to get extra injera--the service was really excellent.  With a beer, tax and tip each of us paid $21.  Not a bad deal!  If last night was usual, then Thursday nights are not too busy and a good time to try this restaurant.  I suspect Fridays and Saturdays are more lively.  There is a DJ booth and a projector.    This would work on a date night or among friends.  During our feast there appeared to be a family dining here, a couple on a date and then a pair of friends.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Prepare to dig in with your bare hands; a total cutlery-free dining experience. Two girl friends and I came with no expectations as it was all our first time for some Ethiopian food. Our server was helpful and kind. She recommended us the Vege platter with an add-on of meats and that'd be plenty to go around. She also gave us a mini-demo on how to eat the food by using injera (bread).   The platter comes with 16 sides with a plate of Injera. Each side had a distinct flavour and you can taste the different spices in each one. The injera taste similar to sourdough; it's a spongey bread with an essence of vinegar when eaten on its own. I find that, that tad bit of sour essence help bring out the flavour in each side. If you're a person with a palette for variety then this platter does justice. This platter satisfied my sweet/tangy, savoury/salty and spicy tastebuds in one night. How amazing is that?!   Atmosphere is pretty chill here and also very dim. Very comfortable and welcoming environment to be in. Will definitely pay another visit!!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner with two large platters. One vegetarian and one with lamb. Lots of flavors and tasting very fresh. Coffee was one of the best we had. Coffee gets roasted right before it gets brewed. Service was very attentive and the decor very tasteful."}
