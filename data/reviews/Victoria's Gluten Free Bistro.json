{"text":"The only restaurant in Mississauga offering a completely gluten free menu. What a lifesaver"}
{"text":"I'm not gluten intolerant, but my boyfriend's mom and sister are.  Because of that we find it incredibly difficult to go out as a group.  They both had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant, so we decided to try it on a whim.  This is more of a fine dining restaurant than a Montana's or Milestones, so you can expect a higher price point.  Definitely comes across on the same level as some of the O&B restaurants.  What was a HUGE relief to my fellow diners wasn't merely the separate gluten free (GF)menu, but the fact that there was also a dedicated kitchen and wait staff!  For once, there was no fear of cross contamination.  A \"gluten free\" server served the GF items, and vice versa.  I don't think I've ever seen my friends so relaxed at a meal.  We started the meal with some GF bruchetta.  The bread tasted just like a regular, toasted loaf.  What a nice start!  From the GF menu, my friends ordered the grilled and fried calarmari and the salmon and veal entrees.  Both calamari appetizers were quite large.  In fact, I would have been full eating just that.  My friend was extremely excited to be eating something that was fried as well.  I didn't have an opportunity to taste their dishes, but both GF eaters cleaned their plates, and trust me, they are picky eaters.  From the other menu, I ordered the caesar salad and the mussels (both appetizer).  The salad was good, but nothing different.  The mussels in a white wine sauce and were also very tasty, but also nothing different.  The atmosphere is very cozy and the staff are friendly and attentive.  Though, they're not reinventing the wheel in terms of dining and flavours, they are providing quality, delicious, \"fancy\" meals for a group of people who are often ignored and misunderstood.  Everyone deserves a nice night out, and this restaurant hits on all levels.  We're going back next week for my boyfriend's dad's birthday!"}
{"text":"I loved it! I was really impressed. The food was GREAT. We went with a party of 6 and they did an excellent job.  I really like that the gluten free items are prepared in a separate kitchen, delivered by separate staff, on plates that are shaped different. I'm VERY reactive and it's nice to have the security eat in peace.  They had gluten free calamari, and it was actually good!  They've clearly put in a ton of effort to make the place not just safe, but also delicious.  The staff were excellent."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous meal tonight. The special appetizer was stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon which was awesome. 6 large shrimp on a bed of arugula salad with feta cheese. Absolutely yummy! Then had the surf and turf. The steak was perfect, the lobster a tad dry but still tasty with the garlic butter on the side. My dinning companion had the veal marsala which was divine. She dropped a hint that it was my birthday and at the end of the meal the wait staff came around with a complimentary huge piece of chocolate cake. We used to come to this restaurant years ago when it was the Cherry Hill. I am glad we have rediscovered Victoria's. We already plan to go back in July. Loved it!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for a double date, two of us celiac, two not. It was nice to have separate menus, and know you could order anything. Interesting that there were two waiters, and two kitchens - very clear that there is no cross contamination. However, this was a VERY expensive place, and the price differences on the menus were a little bizarre. For example, the salads (which had no gluten on either menu) were a few dollars more on the gluten free menu. I assume that is to cover the cost of them using the gfree kitchen, but really? The menu was already vastly overpriced.   Next, they gave my friend and I a very small portion of gfree bread - we asked for more and they said it would cost $4 (afterwards they provided us with some more bread free of charge because they felt that the prior serving size had been inadequate - it was essentially 5 pieces of toasted bread about the size of a toonie).   The servers were polite and well versed in the menu, and the dessert was delicious (white chocolate turtle cheesecake), but again, very very expensive.   Overall, we probably won't be back, simply because spending over $200 for a night out for four people to eat at a restaurant and still be hungry when we left wasn't worth it. If they lowered the prices and maybe increased the portions, it would be a different story."}
