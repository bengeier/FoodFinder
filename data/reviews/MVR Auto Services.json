{"text":"I brought my car in unannounced to have the rear brakes changed. They had no problem fitting me in right away and charged half of what Ted weins was going to charge. After they started they informed me that auto zone gave me the wrong brake pads and they delivered the right ones to get the job done."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for service Great communication and very friendly service Very honest and good quality parts  I need oil change , also my car making sounds and they ck for me to resolve the problem"}
{"text":"After sharing one car for a month and a half, I finally asked a family member to help get my car fixed, the alternator had gone out the first week of June. I called the dealer and the quoted me $600+ to change the alternator, I called MVR and was quoted $360. Once I brought my car in to MVR I was asked if I wanted to use my own alternator, he gave me the price just for labor and it wound up saving me close to $100 and that was even with an oil change on top of it.  I would say that is great service, it is hard to find a place that is honest these days, and I will definitely go back when I need repairs on my cars."}
{"text":"Eddie was great. I was home in Vegas visiting my parents and both their car's AC broke in middle of record heat.  He squeezed them in and was very fair last minute."}
{"text":"Impressed. Brought my car in for engine sensor light on, they reset it for free. Others wanted to charge me$45+. They explained the procedure, very honest and helpful. I will be coming back again. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"Great Price. Great customer service. Speedy service always car has been running great these past couple years"}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this shop. NEW OWNERSHIP, and totally honest and fair. I was quoted 1800 by another shop, I am new about a year in Vegas, and saw their reviews. Wonderful, I can't say enough good, they charged me $600. It was major work and will be doing all my car work with them."}
{"text":"Great service and fair pricing! Ed took good care of me after my AC compressor blew out on our drive to Las Vegas. His concern for my situation was truly refreshing. I highly recommend this business for any auto repairs you might need. Nice to know an auto repair shop that you can trust!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and an honest way of doing business! Definitely not the typical auto service shop. Not only will I recommend MVR Auto Repair, but I will now also refer my family and friends to come here."}
{"text":"My car broke down, i went to 2 shops and was not happy with the prices, i called MVR and Eddie was quite helpful, my car was repaired promptly and the cost was much less than other shops quoted to replace my fuel pump, also David changed my headlight and even cleaned off my windshield, Very nice people, i will take all my future automotive issues to MVR auto"}
{"text":"Engine running hot. They were able to take my car immediately and found the problem!  Eddie was very helpful!"}
{"text":"Honest shop. Won't go anywhere else. They have always been able to fix the real problem without tacking on \"extra\" charges."}
{"text":"I really like this place because they are prompt and it's right around the corner from my house oh and they really do a good job"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place only right down the street from me. Their prices are a whole lot more reasonable than the competition in the area and they hook it up! If you're looking for a friendly local auto shop this is it!"}
{"text":"Great efficient service, had car engine problems and they fixed my Infiniti G35x back to a solid performing car.  Thank you MVR -Eddie"}
{"text":"I did an oil change today and was cheaper than my car dealership. Also they checked why my check engine light is on,gladly nothing serious. I am happy that they are honest people. Very approachable and won't try to sell you things that you don't need. I will recommend them to my family and friends."}
{"text":"I needed my breaks done so called around a couple places and they were the best price. I brought my car in and they were able to get me in right away. Good price and great service and very friendly ! Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Great service and communication.  Eddie helped get me back on the road fast. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I brought my grandfathers truck here and they charged me $60 bucks for a full synthetic oil change which is very affordable. It's conveniently located, the front desk is very polite and the prices they give are unbeatable. No shady mechanics or anything like that here! You can definitely trust this staff with your car. Highly recommended if you're in the neighborhood and its even worth a drive to them if you're not. Thanks to everyone @ MVR Auto Repair!"}
{"text":"I take all my cars in to get oil changes and they always do a great job. It's always affordable and my experience with them is they always seem very honest and helpful to explain issues and repair. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to get service done"}
{"text":"Always very helpful and HONEST. Will check your car and give suggestions rather than bill you for stuff they didnt even do. Will definitely be coming as a regular when needed."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly. I will use this place again. The oil change wasn't over priced and they completed the work in half the time they said it would take."}
{"text":"This guy is unprofessional af. I dropped my car off and told him I was going out of town. I get back and these clowns spilled oil all over the hood of my very nice car. I had to drive thru the car wash 5 times and it finally came out. Oil is very erosive and if it was left on much longer it would of caused permanent visible damage. Idk how these clowns have such a good rating but STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Eddie and  Matt did a amazing job on my car. 1st time here and the customer service is great. There mechanics know what there doing and always helpful on suggestion with maintenance. definitely gonna come back to get my maintenance done with them again!! see you guys soon and congratulations on your 1 year!!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome.  Eddie and Ron were great.  They were quick and didn't try to scam me.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very nice place , i was helped and got my car fixed  , they seem very fair in price and  glad i found a car place close to home .  Eddie and Irene were very friendly ~Thanks so much ~"}
{"text":"These guys are out of their minds. They tried to charge me 2500.00 for a job that las vegas auto did for 500.00. When i first had work done by them, i thought they were honest. Little did i know. It only takes once to blow me off. Won't ever revisit that place again"}
{"text":"Okay, I know there are a number of great auto shop you  can't go wrong with in the town. but this place is a real deal. at least for me. Ed who is the owner and his crews are really friendly and they accommodate customers need and work in honest. of course they are skilled too. I've met a lot of mechanics but I'm pretty sure of them would your best bet if you are in need of hiring a skilled and reliable mechanic for your vehicle."}
{"text":"This is our third time we came here for oil change. Family owned by Rony and Irene a Bulgarian decent from Vancouver Canada. Also with Eddie their front office. The great thing about family owned business is that they are very accomodating and in tune to your needs, easy to talk to. Great service they know car business. Like always be nice and have a great attitude ask nicely don't demand."}
{"text":"Honest guys. I thought I needed a brake job but turns out my brakes were fine and it was just dust. I drive a lifted Jeep Wrangler. It makes a squeal at times but most importantly wanted to be safe. The guys here assured me besides the occasional sound, I was good to go. No charge. Took 10 minutes. Solid team here."}
{"text":"We are new in the area and I've been searching for an honest shop that you can trust and rely on 100% and I truly recommend MVR Auto Services! They provide great service at an affordable price. The mechanics here do a job well done and work with professionalism and integrity.     The service provided is outstanding and exceeds my expectation. I highly recommend them to anyone who cares about their car!"}
{"text":"Very fast service and great pricing. I called four different shops and MVR gave the best price by far on my VW Routan. They took my car right away and even gave me a ride home so I didn't have to wait in the lobby."}
{"text":"This the best and the most honest mechanic i've ever to. Its so hard to find a place like. So glad to have found this place."}
{"text":"I came in for an oil change. The guys were really nice. I'll definitely come back for future repairs/maintenance."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this shop. They have good reviews so I thought I'd go down and get a price on new brakes since I heard a grinding noise. They guy at the counter told me my front brakes and rotors were completely gone and that the rotors had such bad grooves they couldn't be repaired. He said my back brakes and rotors also needed to be replaced and should have been done 40k miles ago and quoted me close to $700. I just bought this car from a guy that really maintained it so I found that hard to believe. I went to Mr. Brake where they told me I still had 15% of life left on my front brakes and 75% on my back brakes and my rotors were completely fine. The grinding noise was due to my front brakes being crystallized so I replaced them. Needless to say I saved myself $500 by going to a different shop that was honest."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Took my mom's car that had been sitting for a few years and though it needed a ton of work.  Owner checked it all over carefully and said Nope, just needs to have a fuel injector cleaner and high test gas put in when it runs close to empty.  HONEST!  They could have charged me 1-2k for work but were so straightforward with me!  I went because of the good reviews and now have mine to add to them!  Referring my friends already!!"}
{"text":"If something is wrong with your car I highly recommend going to them. They don't try to rip you off. They are very honest & courteous."}
{"text":"Ask for Eddie! He's helpful and honest, I came in for a tune up and oil change, diagnostics was free, I have an Audi and most places charges 150, cuz the check engine light was on. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Brought my 2006 Acura MDX & my 2003 Chevy Suburban. Great customer service, they are honest, friendly, affordable & gets job done fast"}
{"text":"This shop is AMAZING!! My kids & I broke down right in their parking lot today. Our battery died in this 100+ degree HEAT!  They came out of the shop & rescued us! Changed our battery & we were on our way. Amazing customer service. I will ABSOLUTELY return. Al and his team are incredible.  I am so thankful to him!!! I'd give 10 stars if I could!!!"}
{"text":"Best auto repair ive ever been to. I had issues with my rear wheels leaking, transmission going out possibly, and even other misc repairs like my engine fan and turning signal switch. They checked out my truck for free and managed to save me a new transmission, swap my clutch, and fix the wheel bearings. My misc issues they fixed for free and not only were they fair but were on top of their game and discovered my UJoint was literally about to break off along with the bushing in my gear shifter. After all repairs were complete I found out they even offer a military discount. MVR is on your side and will take care of you!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about MVR Auto Services, but then I tried to do the routine maintenance of my car couple of times at this place just because it was very close to my home. I was pleasantly surprised that everything was done very fast and I never had any problems after.  Eddie is very helpful, very honest and knowledgeable tech.  Unlike these big dealerships that the waiting time is ridiculously long and they charge you extra for nothing, MVR Auto is very reasonable, quick and professional."}
{"text":"Eddie was sufficient and time considerate with getting my AC fixed in manageable timing ! Thank you Eddie"}
{"text":"I have the worst luck with cars, and to make it worse, I know nothing about auto mechanics. So I often feel that I am taken advantage of when having my vehicle repaired! This NOT the case with MVR Auto! From the time I dropped my car off, to the call from the mechanic telling me what was wrong, to the payment for repairs, to picking up my car.... it was a very smooth, seamless, professional, and surprisingly painless process! I felt that they sympathized with my situation, fixed ONLY what was broken, didn't charge me a fortune ($150 less than other places I checked out.) and got me back on the road within 1 business day. This was a transmission problem, and other shops said I would be without my car at least a week. I drive for a living, that alone was impressive. If I have ANY other problems with my car, MVR Auto is the only place for me!"}
{"text":"Received a very good price on an engine swap! Quality work and much less expensive than everywhere else in Las Vegas. Will come again. Highly recommended. Be sure to ask for Eddie when you stop in."}
{"text":"Make sure you asked for Eddie, he takes really good care if both or our cars. His prices are very very reasonable specially that our cars are not cheap to maintained. (European cars)  I can always depend on them for all my car needs."}
{"text":"Thank you, MVR, and especially Eddie, for reviving my poor car! I found this business here on Yelp and took my CTS to get diagnosed because it felt like it was going to explode, literally. Eddie was super helpful right from the get-go. He is very detail oriented and he, as well as the MVR team, took their time figuring out what the issue was.   When they discovered a major problem with the timing chain and system, he was very honest and suggested that I call Cadillac to see if it was covered under a recall warranty. Due to my luck with these things, it would have been covered, only the extended recall expired March of this year. *face palm*  Eddie made sure to call me with any updates and made me feel super comfortable throughout the entire process. I picked up my car today and it runs like a dream! I will definitely be a return customer for MVR. Thanks again, everyone!"}
{"text":"I had an oil change two months  ago -- they were very efficient.  Today,  I went there and had my tires check-- he took care of it right away and was very helpful. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Look for Eddie! Great service, great guy, great location! Been here twice and now and will definitely come back for future repairs / check-ups."}
{"text":"I read about this shop on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. This place has the friendliest help and they are by far priced fairly for their services. Elena (I hope thats how you spell her name was very helpful) and I will be sure to give all business in the future."}
{"text":"They quoted me a price of $74 for an AC service. They took 30 minutes and did what they said they would do for the price they said they would. Very nice and professional."}
{"text":"This shop is the real deal! Ed and Ronnie really helped me out with my car. They repaired my car for a way cheaper price than what Sahara Auto was charging me for. I'm not the type to put down others so I will keep my comments to myself. However, this place I am sooo Happy I was able to take my car there to get it fixed. The customer service was great! They are very honest people and will work with you and I look forward to referring all my family members and friends to MVR Auto. You guys are doing a Great Job! Keep up the great work! Thank you soooo much Ed & Ronnie! #BestAutoShopInTown"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service!  Eddie is very knowledgeable.  I highly recommend coming here to get your car serviced."}
{"text":"Spoke to Al i think he was the manager ... great customer service,  .... came in for a oil change had it done on the same day... will definitely come again ."}
{"text":"Easily the most honest auto repair shop I have ever been to.   I came in with kind of an emergency. I'm on a road trip and needed to get back on the road. The guys at MVR got my car in, got the part delivered and had me on my way super quick. They even saved me money by checking to see if both sensors on my car were bad or just one.   One of the things I noticed, with every customer they gave them the old parts. Even windshield wiper blades. Someone got an oil change and their blades changed, they had their old blades to show them. That is HUGE. Every single customer I saw in the 3 hours I sat in their waiting room was shown their old parts and their questions were answered.   I also noticed that they had quite a few \"regulars\". After my experience, I can definitely see why. I would 100% recommend this shop. The only complaint I have is that they are not in California so I can use them when I need repairs."}
{"text":"Came in for an oil change. Was in and out quick. Very fair price, no hassle, friendly staff. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for a four wheel brake job. This included replacing the rear brake drums, turning the front disks and pads all the way around. For Yelp customers a free oil change is offered when spending $250 or more. They offer an ample sized waiting area and free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Went to a couple places around my area for a tune up but I also didnt want to break my pockets. I came accross this place and thought I'd give this place a try. As soon as I came in the gentleman Eddie helped me out and educated me on some car knowledge, so I don't overspend on stuff I wouldn't need service for. I can honestly say he was really humble and honest. Dealerships wouldve charged me close to a grand for the same tune up. I'm glad I came here."}
{"text":"BEST place to go for HONEST and QUALITY work at a price that you can afford.  Service: My a/c stopped blowing cold air on my way to work two days ago. Mind you, it is the middle of summer AND I am a college student with limited time and a crazy schedule. I was looking for a shop nearby my house and... tada! There it was: MVR Auto Repair. It is owned and operated by Al who you will see in front with his tech Rony. This team works miracles! They did a thorough inspection to isolate the cause of my a/c problem and kept me informed every step of the way. He did not give me the run around nor did he try to persuade me to perform unnecessary work. Despite his busy shop, he managed to have me up and running the next day. They even worked after hours to have my car back to me as promise.   Customer Service: Being a young looking female, I've always had a hard time trusting auto repairs shops so I normally would bring a friend or my father. After reviewing a couple shops nearby and not wanting to drive across town for a different shop, I decided to check this place out especially since they are open on Saturdays. I wanted to find a local reputable shop on my own (I also did a little bit of price canvasing on my own, so I would know the estimated price it would cost). My first impression and experience with Al and Rony is nothing but stellar customer service. Rony greeted me as he was working in the shop and guided me to the front office space. Al prides himself in honesty and constant communication. You can tell these are genuine people that keep your best interest in mind.   Overall: If you are in the neighborhood or looking for a new shop, I definitely recommend this place. The prices are great and you can't beat doing business with genuine, honest, and knowledgeable people who will go out of their way to get you back on the road again."}
{"text":"I saw this place on yelp and it had good reviews and was also close to my house  Came in for a brake job and radiator flush and the work was done with no issues and was completed in the time quoted Eddie was great, friendly, and I will definitely come back for future service"}
{"text":"MVR has the fairest prices in town. I called several shops in the area and they were the least expensive by far. Eddie is very helpful and will be honest with you about the amount of work that is truly required. Hey didn't try to up sell me, and had my car done when promised at the price promised. I highly recommend this shop"}
{"text":"MVR AUTO is Great for all your auto service! Eddie is so reliable and he knows so much. I've been going to them for over 2 years and had nothing but great service. I got my brakes done on my bmw m3 and he got it done on time and with a great price too. Thank you Eddie and the guys at MVR! Would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I was referred here by a friend and I'm glad I brought my car here. They are very honest and don't try to rip you off telling you something needs to be changed when it doesn't. Eddie provided great customer service and communicated well. I highly recommend this auto shop to anyone looking for quality and honesty!"}
{"text":"Emergency service on my car and came here, Eddie is Great and very nice and took care  of my car right away ... affordable and close by .. please check it out if u live on this side of town .."}
{"text":"We brought vw beetle here with engine starting problem at Saturday before Memorial Day two hours before closing. Eddie diagnosed fuel pump problem and fixed it as soon as part arrived. He also found another critical issues with this car and gave us reasonable price for fixing them"}
{"text":"New Owners are Really Nice (March 2016) Quick help with a piece of metal in the tire. Will be back soon since I live so close for sure!   Located: *NEXT TO DOTTY's* Windmill & Jones.   I Wanted to personally thank Eddie & Matt for the super fast Help & honestly about my tire issue.   Thanks Again!  I'll be letting everyone know in my \"NEIGHBORHOOD\" APP."}
{"text":"Quick.. Reliable solid work.. beat the competition by $100 on each thing I've had done and got quotes on. Extremely happy with MVR and will be using them for all future repairs/upgrades."}
{"text":"I always go here,  it is laterally in my neighborhood.  But the people that own it are very kind, loving, honest folk. So i mean, thats a plus"}
{"text":"Stopped in without an appointment to get my brakes checked. I explained my problem and they were able to inspect my car right away and figure out the issue. Turned out I needed front and back brakes all new. At first I was told it would take until about 1 pm, but they were able to finish by noon! Their quickly service and reasonable pricing make me want to return when I need my car looked at in the future!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and prices. We had a difficult noise to diagnose (tried two other mechanics) . Eddy took the time to isolate the noise and find the issue. Great job!"}
{"text":"These guys are honest an thorough I would recommend there service to anyone. They also are competitively priced and on time"}
{"text":"Ed and Irene were great! Took my car that had a loose gas pedal at the last minute. Thankfully they were conveniently close to home. The main thing I look for is customer servive and price and they surprised me on both."}
{"text":"Take my jeep here for regular maintenance. These guys are great and they don't try and screw you with jacked up rates.  No Suprise charges and my jeep is always ready when they say it will be."}
{"text":"Needed rotors and pads, awesome job and fair price. I'll be back for next oil change as well."}
{"text":"I had my brakes fixed and since ot was going to take more than a couple of hours they offered to drive me home & pick me up when it was done.  Very friendly and good service"}
{"text":"These people are great and fair! Highly recommend. They looked at the issue with my car for over an hour and didn't charge me a penny. Trustworthy -- and that, to me, is one of the most important things you can ask for in a body shop."}
{"text":"I come to this place often and never disappoints. Gets everything done and they're honest about what they do. Glad I came here for my tune up and all my fluid changes. Eddie is the man to go to!"}
{"text":"The Best service and professional stuff European engenders   . Very clean . Discounts etc"}
{"text":"Here now with our truck and so far the price and customer service is good. Came here based on the other Yelp reviews so I'm hoping once we get our truck back, we would have found an auto place that we can trust and bring our cars and refer our friends."}
{"text":"I took my car to Eddie at MVR. I had an intermittent battery light and they checked the alternator for me. They didn't charge a diagnostic fee, and told me wait till the problem is constant and then come back. They could have easily replaced the part and I wouldn't have questioned them. I will definitely use them again in the future."}
{"text":"I didn't actually have any work done here, but they did spend 39 minutes doing diagnostics on my VW Beetle. They were willing to admit that they weren't actually sure what the heck was going on. I respect that! As a woman, I tent to get the run around or totally screwed when dealing with mechanics, so this was very refreshing. I'll be back here if I need anything in the future!"}
{"text":"Awesome pricing and great customer service!!! They also gave me a military discount!!! They don't work on commission so they will never haggle you unlike most quick lube shop."}
{"text":"Honest estimates and skilled mechanics here. They got my old AC diagnosed, retrofitted, and serviced in no time. I'd like to thank Eddie for truly exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"I was in a pickle. I brought a car from a person and the tires and shocks were shot and I thought it was just a little free play problem that could be fixed easily.  Turns out my tires were split and the shocks were shot. I turned to these guys and what separates them is the payment plan they offer. It made replacing the tires and shocks fully manageable and I'm going to be a lot smoother on the road. Eddie will explain the plan to you if you ever need the assistance. The repair timeline is also swift as well!  Good business they have here!  Edit: after 1 1/2 months of doing the tire alignment with my new shocks and tires, they're off center. I am mildly annoyed with this since it was just so recently."}
{"text":"I came here thinking I needed to get my brake pads changed. I went to the dealership for an oil change previously and they told me I was most likely going to need to change my brake pads when I came back. After they inspected my brakes, they informed me that I still had 10,000 miles before I would need to change them. MVR gives very fair prices and are very honest people."}
{"text":"Got an oil change here a few weeks ago, and my car started leaking oil afterwards. I was away from town and when I was finally able to bring it in somewhere to have it looked at, they said the oil plug was stripped. Had to have the plug and gasket replaced. They suggested it happened during my last oil change, and that I never go back to the place that did it."}
{"text":"I have always come here for my car maintenance needs. They are always honest and prices are always reasonable."}
{"text":"This shop is family oriented. They give such great service!!! Owner does not want to overcharge you for more than what is needed!!!! Great place to take your vehicle for any auto repair and service."}
{"text":"Work was done the same day. Over $400 for a tune up  for a ford explorer is what will keep me away from this place."}
