{"text":"I received a response from the owner of Wood Fired Flatbreads apologizing for our bad experience, explaining that the employee in question is no longer with the company, and offering us free pizzas at this year's Little Italy Days event. This is truly excellent customer service and much more akin to the wonderful first experience we had with them in 2014. We will definitely be going back this year!"}
{"text":"OMG a pizza I looked for all my life...as perfect as you can find.  Chewy thin slightly chard crust that is sturdy enough to hold the toppings, tomato sauce that tasted homemade and delicious, just enough cheese to satisfy ( not a chewy cheese like bubble gum pulling to the ceiling) and finally a pinch or two of fresh cut basil. I added pepperoni to the second Margherita pizza and was in heaven. You gotta go  find this truck.  No kidding..I am HOOKED."}
{"text":"I was drawn in by the flames of the authentic  wood fired oven and the delightful  smell of garlic and fresh herbs.
After studying all the options, I decided on the white pie with spinach and mushrooms and I was very happy with my choice. It had just the right amount of garlic and the toppings were fresh and cooked to perfection! I loved this pizza !!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Margherita and the blanco flatbread. The margherita was nothing to write home about but the blanco. Mmm mmm mmmm amazing! Would for sure get this again and my 11 month old daughter also gives it a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I stopped by their stand with some friends at Bloomfield Little Italy Days last Fri.  I saw their wood-fired pizza oven trailer the evening before, at which time I decided that I'd like to try their pizza when I returned.  Fortunately, they were still there the next evening!  My friends were also intrigued, and decided to try some of their pizza, as well.

I ordered a classic Margherita pizza (my standard for judging wood fired pizza), one friend (Friend 1) ordered a mushroom white pizza, and another friend (Friend 2) ordered a four cheese pizza with mushrooms.  Since they were busy, the guy waiting on us told us they'd take about 10 min. to be ready, which was no problem for us.  In the meantime, we ordered Italian sodas to go with our pizzas--strawberry (me), tangerine (Friend 1), and black raspberry (Friend 2)--which we sipped on while waiting.  My soda was on the weak side, and my friend who ordered the tangerine soda said the same (his looked even weaker).  My friend who ordered the black raspberry soda seemed to enjoy hers the most, which wasn't surprising, since it looked the strongest and was the most popular, according to the guy who served us.  While I was waiting for my soda, I mentioned to the guy making it that I'd ordered a pizza, as well, and he said I should let him know what I think of it.  (I didn't get a chance to tell him in person, so this review counts as my assessment!)

Since the sodas took a couple of minutes to prepare, we didn't have to wait much longer for the pizzas, which all were served within about a 2-3 min. window.  After grabbing some paper towels, we walked around the block to find a place to sit, and after finding one, promptly dug in.  I don't hesitate to claim that my pizza was the best wood-fired Margherita pie I've had in PGH to date!  The sauce was well-seasoned and not too sweet, the fresh mozzarella had a nice tender texture, and unlike one of the versions of this pizza I've tried dahntahn, the crust was nice and crispy (win!).  My friends and I swapped slices of our pizzas, so I was able to try theirs, and they were both excellent as well.  Since I'm a sucker for white pizza, I slightly preferred the white mushroom pizza, which had just enough--but not too much--garlic flavor, but Friend 2's four cheese pepperoni was very good in its own right--in terms of flavor and ingredients, it was closer to typical American pizza.  Although at least two of the pizzas sounded similar from the description of ingredients, each of the pizzas were quite distinct in terms of flavor profile.  It was very clear from the taste of the pies that they use high-quality ingredients.

Aside from the weakness of the Italian sodas, the only minor complaint I have is that by the time my friends and I ate our pizzas, they were cooler than I'd like.  However, I can't blame the vendor for this, as they were served quite hot--it took us awhile to find a place to sit.  Also, it appears from their menu that Italian sodas are not a regular offering, so I'm giving them a pass since their pies were so good.

If you see these guys and their wood fired trailer oven at an event, I'd highly recommend ordering a pie from them, since their product is excellent.  While I haven't hired them for an event myself, from my interactions with them, they seem very professional and focused on producing quality goods that will leave customers satisfied.  (I also love that all of them wear chef's hats!)  They're definitely cooking up some of the best wood-fired pizza in PGH, so give it a try--I'm certain you'll love it, too!"}
{"text":"Had them cater my wedding reception at a local park. Everyone raved about the pizza. They loved the idea and several guest asked me for their information for future parties. Pizza came out very quick and it was very fresh and delicious. The people are very friendly and easy to work with."}
{"text":"Puts the Anthonys chain to shame! Love the truck, except when it no show/no called at nova place. Left a very hungry department at pnc with no lunch, as everyone was planning on your pizza!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  I was at the food truck rally in Market Square for Earth Day today, and ordered a Margarita pizza.  Chef Rob cooked it up in his brick oven, and it was ready in about 4 minutes.  DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"They catered my wedding on 4/30/2016. If I had to do it all again, I would definitely have them cater it again. I had 65 guests and every single one complimented me on the pizza (and salad)

We got the Petite Package with the Tennessee Pig and Gorgonzola Filet. Caramelized Walnut, Cranberry, with Gorgonzola and Champagne Dressing Salad and Italian Salad. 

I wish I would have ordered more of the CWCGCD Salad, even the squares liked it ;) and I wish I would have been able to take flatbread to go.

The venue owner fudged and didn't reserve a spot out front for the truck but Kim and the crew took it in stride, they parked on the side of the building and made it work. They even dealt with the rain! 

Thanks for being apart of our memories!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza with fresh ingredients. Once the pizza hits the oven it cooks pretty quickly. Chef was happy to answer questions while a few of stood around. Friendly and delicious."}
{"text":"So Good!  A interesting menu of about 4 pies with a Bianco, Margherita, Formaggi and Tennessee Pig.  I know they have some others but today these were available.  The Tennessee Pig peaked my interest.  It has smoked bacon and smoked Gouda cheese drizzled with Jack Daniels infused pure maple syrup and topped with walnuts and dabs of ricotta cheese.  Really enjoyed the combination of flavors.  It was a little on the sweet side but since we were sharing the size was about right.  
They have a good system and it did not take to long even thought they were busy.  Hats off to Chef Rob who was working the oven and the two associates in the truck."}
