{"text":"I stopped here with my two kids and had a great meal.  The selection was plentiful and all reasonably priced.  The salad bar was excellent, fresh and lots of choices. The mac and cheese burger was really good.  Our server was excellent and very friendly.  I would never guess in a grocery store....worth the stop!!!"}
{"text":"Good fresh food - medina locals best little secret for a great meal. Salad bar is great...  nice and cozy!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant.  You would not expect to find a restaurant inside the grocery store.  This appears to be there flagship store.  They have nice menu selection.  Be sure to get the salad bar as part of your meal.  Nice variety of items that are replenished."}
{"text":"Back for more!  Well, Wednesday means $1 off sandwichs.  So looking over special board I see the beef brisket.  Walking in they are cooking brisket in propane smoker by the store entrance.  When in doubt go for the special, because at least they think its special!  The brisket was sliced about 1/4\" thick and was a little dry.  They had a good smoky BBQ sauce, could of used a little bit of bite.  Pretty much beef, sauce, lettuce and mater (for a grocery it could have been red, you know).  Decent sandwich served with chips and priced at $7.99 after $1 off."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think a restaurant in a grocery store would be that great, but this one is.  Food has always been good and service has always been top notch."}
{"text":"Changed their menu over a year ago and I am still disappointed. I have given this place many chances but still sad that the menu took off healthy items like apple slices and sweet potato fries. They also removed many appetizers such a cheese sticks. I still go here just for convince of getting a meal and grocery shopping done but do not go here any other time."}
{"text":"We love this place, I've gone since I was a child and now bring my little one. FOOD IS LOCALLY GROWN and good too. Only downside is that the staff could use tweaking."}
