{"text":"We really enjoyed their food, lots of flavor and spices (which is hard to find in Pgh). My only recommendations are to shorten the menu or make sure that you have everything on it and to have the employees dress a little more professionally. The guys are all very nice and helpful though. We will definitely be back. My kids loved it!!"}
{"text":"I love Liam's, my favorite food was KFC. But now I go right pass them go to Liam's they always get my order right, and they are always friendly."}
{"text":"Got the chicken dinner box. Food was great! Fries where out of this world! The server was very pleasant. Smiles and all. Only negative was the wait time. It took a while to get out food, but at the same time it was rush hour and only two people where behind the counter. Overall, a very good experience. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Clam strip dinner. The fellow who took my order informed me the frozen clam strips were stuck together, so I was getting a double order. What arrived was barely a single order anywhere else  (Nieds, Oyster House). The clams were in a couple of fist sized wads, outsides were overcooked, and the insides had raw, room temperature clam and uncooked batter. At over $9, I would say avoid on all accounts (price, quantity and quality)."}
{"text":"Probably not worth the price or the wait.... Liam's is a decent choice if you'd like a good variety of fried foods they have everything from several types of fish to egg rolls. I had the fried chicken and shrimp combo with sweet potato fries ($13- $12 +$1 to substitute in sweet potato fries. The chicken was okay (not worth $1.25/wing) and the shrimp was better than the chicken but the portion was only decent for the price. Now the mustard barbecue sauce that was honestly nothing shy of delicious. Overall, I had higher expectations for both the crispness and flavorful seasoning of the food and walked away disappointed. Service is friendly sauce is good ....if those top your list, give it a shot. If not probably keep moving."}
{"text":"The wings were awful. All fat and gristle, and so small. The sides we wanted were sold out at the beginning of dinner time.  Most of the food was thrown out because it just wasn't worth eating."}
{"text":"Nice change of pace. I've had wings,  catfish nuggets and fried perch. The fried perch is my favorite. The catfish nuggets were good but the portion was too small. I wasn't impressed with the chicken wings or french fries. The broccoli cole slaw and hush puppies were really good.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. They are new and I've seen improvement with each visit so I see great potential in this restaurant and look forward to future visits. They have plenty of parking, seating, offer take out and accept credit /debit cards. Liam's is certainly on the rise in Wilkinsburg."}
{"text":"I've been to Liam's twice for takeout and have gotten the same thing each time, an order of chicken wings. I've never had any issues with a long wait. The restaurant was quite empty. The first time I was actually planning on going to KFC which was also empty, but decided to give Liam's a try. Each time the staff was friendly. And my wings came directly out of the fryer. My orders were fresh and tasty. 

I read the other negative reviews and feel bad that they experienced that type of service and quality with the food. The second time around I told myself that Liam's is a good spot to get fried chicken. I was also able to apply a Yelp 10% discount when I checked in. I normally hit up Giant Eagle but I'm happy I found this spot that's fairly close to home. I certainly hope I continue to have a positive experience there."}
{"text":"Im a new customer called in waited on the phone for 10 mins no one ever came back to the phone for me to place my order i wont be going to there restaurant there loss if your a new customer and a new business u cant afford to lose customers!!!   Dumb must be black owned were the only people who treat customers any kinda way."}
{"text":"I have fish allergies & this was a great experience with remarkable customer service.  They use separate fryers for chicken, fish, fries. Because I informed them when I placed my order, they changed out ALL of the cooking utensils and cut fresh potatoes 'just in case'. The food was GOOD too! 
Also, they serve beer & such. Let me just say: BOOZY SLUSHIES! 16 oz frozen alcoholic beverage that did not disappoint, only $3.99! Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Got the wings, Mac-n-cheese, & frog legs

Well I can say I've been to Liam's. Very empty no traffic at all just me in there. The price was ok for food received ($10.69), they had one cook and one cashier not sure if it's always this empty or just a bad day. The wings were not bad as well as the frog legs, but as far as the mac-n-cheese..... well there was macaroni and there was cheese so I guess it qualifies as such but wouldn't make my top 100 . Oh then there's the uncooked sweet potato pie (same feeling as the Mac) that was charged at $3.99 and priced on the wall as $2.99 

I can say I've been but probably won't be back well maybe for the frog legs"}
{"text":"I have been to Liam's a few times. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try authentic  Cajun food. The catfish, shrimp, and frog legs are delicious. The various types of hot sauces are good as well. In addition to the good food, the management at Liam's is very good too. They certainly know how to treat a customer. One time I went there and the food wasn't up to par. Management gave me a free meal on the house. 

Go try Liam's, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've tried out Liam's a few times as an alternative to KFC. Good portion size for the sides and the mains and everything is prepared fresh (i.e. no heat lamps for the fried food). Everything is pretty tasty and seasoned well. I especially like the fried okra and the fried swai. Though sometimes the fried okra will be uneven - some are thickly battered. As others have noted, the wings are full sized wings and the sauce is served on the side. They also started serving alcoholic slushies (with booze or wine mixed in) for $4. Can't beat that! 

It does take a bit of time to get your order ready as everything is cooked fresh, so not the fastest fast food. As well, they run out of some sides, so be flexible.  The last thing is the menu - they only serve about 12 different things but the menu is confusing because it has many iterations and combos (dinner platters, combos, snack boxes) that it creates some decision fatigue. 

I hope Liam's does well. I think once they get some experience, they'll get even better (and maybe have a non-fried entree or two). I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile since I often drive by on the way home from work and I live a couple miles away. I came around 8:45 and they close at 10.  There was no one at the counter when I arrived and just a couple people sitting at tables. Someone noticed me when I came up to the counter and walked up to greet me, but seemed pretty tired and kind of annoyed I was there but she was polite enough.  I was really disappointed that most of the more interesting menu items were no longer offered--either not on the menu anymore at all or things they had run out of.  The only sides they had to offer that night were green beans or corn.  And the sides I was most excited about like red beans, dirty rice, collard greens, or mac n cheese are no longer even on their menu at all :(. They also no longer had the perch, clams, whiting or asian catfish on the menu (now it just says \"fish\" in some places without a specifier as to what kind), and the frog legs and oysters were scratched out (temporarily or permanently gone I am not sure).  I'm from Louisiana so I was super excited that this place had a soul food/cajun theme to some of it's food and I ended up being so disappointed.  Although it's supposed to be a fast food place I had to wait about 15 min for my food even though there was barely anyone there and the whole place smelled like a frier with poor ventilation, even though when I initially came in the friers hadn't been in use until they started to prepare my order.  I got the fried fish nuggets and green beans and the fish nuggets were indeed quite good and perfectly fried. The green beans were ok (fyi they are cooked with pork in case anyone is vegetarian). Their credit card machine was also broken so it was a good thing I had cash. This place has so much potential.  I hope to see it turn around."}
{"text":"told in the drive thru my order would take 8 min and they only had fries for sides.  that would have been ok. It is now 15 min since I started counting.  I probably let at least 5 min go.  At this point the taste is irrelevant"}
{"text":"Black owned restaurant. Delicious food. Great music.  Good service.

My girlfriend and I had dinner at Liam's and we loved it. It's mainly fried food, like chicken wings, fried fish, hush puppies, fish sandwich and more. 

This place just opened and its located in the borough of Wilkinsburg, next to the KFC and the East End Busway.

I ordered the wings combo, which was delicious! And my partner ordered the fish sandwich, yum.

I took a picture of my wings, but got too busy eating and forgot to take more pics."}
{"text":"Not quite your ordinary fried food joint. It's way better! The food tastes great, the restaurant is clean, and the menu is unique, clear, organized. 

I've tried the fried oysters, fried Asian catfish, chicken wings, and fries. The fried oysters are delicious, and so is the fried Asian catfish (which my boyfriend also loves). I'm very picky with chicken wings and the way they make it is perfect: well-seasoned and crispy, but also with a good amount of meat. You can also get shrimp and frog legs. They have lots of different sauces to choose from too (ranch, BBQ, honey BBQ, etc.) 

I've only been to Liam's twice so far (and will definitely return), but both times I was really impressed with the owner's genuine passion and dedication to the growth of his new business. He asks his employees about possible changes before going through with them and takes the time to talk to new and returning customers about changes that might occur and asks for their opinions. He is overall such a sweet and friendly person. It's great chatting with him!

{"text":"Definitely some of the best wings, fish, and cole slaw around. But they use Uber-Eats only sometimes, and are often closed in the middle of the afternoon when they should be open. I've even ordered on the phone with them, only to show up and be told that they were closing. And this is always way before closing time. So, so frustrating. This could be a really good place if it were managed decently."}
