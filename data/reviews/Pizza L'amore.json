{"text":"The service at this place is quite fast. The pizza itself was not good quality. I felt kind of intimated ordering the food as it was my first time there and the person taking my order just seemed impatient and judging. I felt a bit sick after having a slice of the pizza and decided not to have the rest. I won't be returning there."}
{"text":"This will always be the best pizza in Scarborough, hands down. Service is impeccable, and they have great deals. Though it is more expensive than PizzaPizza, it is well worth the extra few dollars to enjoy fresh ingredients and great service.  Note: the pizza can be a little greasy, so no white shirts while enjoying."}
{"text":"They have soft drinks you can't get in Canada with real cane sugar !

Pizza and toppings were top notch."}
{"text":"I had heard about L'amore a few times and was in the mood for pizza today so checked it out.   Went with my son and each got a slice which they had a very good selection of both meat and veg slices.  I had a mixed vegetables and feta cheese slice and my son had bacon, peppers and cheese which were both very good with lots of toppings and you could taste the freshness and quality of the ingredients.   This is my new go to for pizza.

Nice family business with the owner there to greet and serve customers. 

Bonus they have sauces and spices you can add for free."}
{"text":"Best damn pizza in the GTA.  All the classic toppings applied with care. Crust that makes you want more. I could eat these pies every day of the week."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place since I don't live in the area and it was a bit of a drive but decided to since its on the top 10 pizza places in Scarborough. It was great! You definitely won't be disappointed. The pizza is loaded with toppings and the owner is so creative the speciality pizzas. Had a medium half Gourmet and half Bacon Bruschetta. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Solid pizza place. Was impressed with the food, the service and how quick they were. Delivery driver was polite and knowledgable. This is important because I live on a boat and he knew enough to call before he arrived so I had time to walk from my boat to meet him"}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious, but definitely on the greasy side.

All the dough and sauces are made in house and they have some fun specialty pizzas.

I removed one star because of the grease factor. I had to dab mine with napkins just to make it edible. Mind you, it was worth the extra work and wasted napkins."}
{"text":"It's more expensive then pizza pizza but so worth it for a quality pizza. I almost forgot what a real one tasted like. All fresh ingredients, made to order. This is one mom and pop shop I hope stands it's ground for many more years to come.  They also make a killer chicken parmigiano.  Pretty much only for take out but totally worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Fresh, tasty pizza... one of a kind. Clean venue. Great guy behind the counter. I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"great little gem in scarborough!! highly recommend their pizza!"}
{"text":"Simple pizza place with some stools by the window if you wanna stay and eat a slice.  Good pizza, not too salty.  I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I really love pizza and I consider myself a pizza connoisseur. There are many ways to make a pizza, however, only a few way to make one right! All the ingredients work together but only when they are in the correct ratio, too much of one or too little of another throws this delicate balance out of sync and ruins what otherwise would be a perfect pie. God knows how many times I have come to a pizza joint and they don't get this basic principle. 

L'Amore really puts their name to the test, making good pizza is a love and art form. I know what you may be thinking \"it's just pizza!\" But no my friends it's really not. Pizza is a simple but beautiful food, only if done right though. These guys make their pizza in all the right rations, with fresh ingredients, good service, great deals, and lots of love! I have tried one of all their signature pizzas and they are all good, you cannot go wrong with any of them! Bruschetta Bacon and gourmet are my top picks Mediterranean and Deluxe come a close second. I should also mention that they have a nice soda selection like pineapple and grape, which are not always offered in most places especially the pineapple (my personal favorite). 

I highly recommend this place the service is great but the pizzas are better."}
{"text":"It's been several weeks since I tried this pizza for the first time, and since I was on yelp, I feel obligated to post a review for this place since I have been craving it ever since.

For years I have been going to this plaza to get my nails done, and this place has been there for as long as I can remember, but I had never once tried it until recently when my DH came home with a box of pizza from here.  Delicious.  Not what you would expect from a hole in the wall fast food pizza joint.  More like one of the high end downtown TO pizza joints.  It's nice to know I can get a pizza without having to drive 30-45 minutes to get a good one!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm one of the few who likes Pizza Pizza.. Pizza L'Amore to me, tastes like Pizza Pizza but with better seasoning and crust. They got some pretty good specials too, but I just got the pickup special. Another note is that they don't have much seating, it's just like 5 seats at the window."}
{"text":"My family lives in Scarborough, and when I was asked what I felt like eating for lunch on Saturday, pizza was the first thing that came to my mind. So I went on to Yelp and did a search for pizza restaurants in the area (yeah, I don't know Scarborough well). Pizza L'Amore had a lot of great reviews, so we got in the car and drove over. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by whom I believe is the owner. He was really friendly and attentive. My mom wanted a \"Canadian pizza\" with no bacon. Sigh. She got schooled because apparently a pizza is not \"Canadian\" without the bacon! I fought for the bacon and I won. In the end we ordered a medium Canadian pizza (bacon, mushrooms and pepperoni) with extra cheese. The total came to approximately $15 (give or take .50 cents). While we waited for our pizza to cook, I noticed that they carried Fanta - the kind you get in Mexico! I was surprised by the price - under $2 for a bottle. Naturally my mom wanted to know what all the fuss was about, so she got one as well, and loved it! The owner told us about how quickly he goes through them, and although they are expensive and his profit is not great, his customers love them so much that he can't not have them in stock. 

As for the pizza....

I loved how thick and fluffy the dough is and they don't hold back on the toppings either! My only qualm was the salty dough. If I had known that the dough would have more salt than chain stores such as Pizza Pizza, I would have gone along with my mom's request and omitted the bacon. Other than the salt issue, I thought the pizza was delicious, and worth the trip to Scarborough. Plus, I am a huge fan of family run businesses - the good ones make you feel like you are dining in their kitchen - and this business made me feel just that. 

Here is their website: http://www.pizzalamore.com/en/

Thick or Thin Crust, Extra Sauce, Whole Wheat Crust (Available in Large Size), Chili Peppers, and Oregano

Finally....

* 1 Medium Pizza (1 topping)

{"text":"Amazing pizza, perfect place to drop in and grab a slice. Definitely worth trying some of the deluxe slices!"}
