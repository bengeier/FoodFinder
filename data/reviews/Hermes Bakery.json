{"text":"This is a bakery in Toronto that more Torontonians should be rushing to. The baking is absolutely phenomenal for the most part but there is one glorious piece of decadence that Hermes Bakery makes with perfection, that is of course kokosh. To look at it, this might not seem like much. It isn't decorated or made fancy like some bakeries wasting time on the appearance over the taste. This is a heavy and rich pastry filled with either chocolate or cinnamon and made to perfection.

I don't want to take away from their other baked goods, which are also amazing, but this is a rarity that I have had a difficult time coming across, and if I ever do I find it hard to imagine it will taste as good as it is made at Hermes.

The one piece of advice that I would give is to call first and make sure they actually have kokosh available. They make it only once or twice a week and also their hours are not as traditional as other businesses. So do yourself a favour and give them a shout before you make the trip.

So go Torontonians! Go forth and get some kokosh. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hermes Bakery. Wow. I dormed next door to it for a full year. Their kokosh cake is literally worth killing for, as are their cherry open faced danishes. There were literally times I ate 3 of them in a sitting! 

That being said, their service is not the greatest, and there were two occasions that I had a foreign object in a baked goods (a toothpick and a pit) hence the four star rating. I definitely suggest you stop by there if youre in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best kokosh. Best cheese danishes. Period! Great small grocery shop (though pricey!). Their potato kugel and potato knishes are yum too. You may have to wait online for a while though if you go on a busy time. But generally it's quick in and quick out."}
{"text":"NUTS   FREE 

This is a kosher bakery located in Jewish neighbourhood area.  Their fresh pastries and cakes are baked daily.  What I like most about HB is all baked goods are peanuts and nuts FREE!!! You must try it!"}
{"text":"I could write at length about how Toronto's kosher restaurants and bakeries serve a captive audience, and how our food culture often suffers for it. 

I don't keep kosher though, so it's really not my argument to make. 

Located on Bathurst and Glencairn, in the middle of a strip of bakeries, butchers and other businesses that service Toronto's observant Jewish community Hermes sells great fresh rye breads and rolls, light chocolate dipped cookies, and super treats both haymishe (cheese Danish are a specialty) and goyishe (equally good donuts, cupcakes and an excellent Boston Cream pie). 

I'd rate Hermes higher but for two factors: 

The first is restrictive hours. As a kosher facility, they close early on Friday and all day Saturday, along with most Jewish holidays (which basically removes much of September and October from the calendar). Inconvenient but certainly understandable. 

The second is much less understandable. Service is atrocious. Hermes employs the biggest collection of grouches this side of Oscar's trash can. A three year old's friendly hello is met with a sneer that transitions to a scowl. breakable spritz cookies are shoved carelessly into boxes, rye breads are heaved in your face, and questions are ignored, shrugged off or insulted...and not in a clever New York Deli way. Seriously. This place employs jerks. 

One of the best things Hermes has going for it is it's nut-free status. Mindful of allergies in the family, we once ordered a birthday cake. Our instructions were (we thought) simple: chocolate cake, white icing, no fruity gels (at least half of our household hates the stuff). We got a cake laden with red fruity goo. We asked them to give us a replacement. At first they refused, then claimed we hadn't made the request, so pay up sucka. Then they checked the order form and saw the request. And offered to change it...by piping additional icing on top of the goo. Then they offered to sell us a different cake. For an upcharge. Then they offered to write the birthday victim's name on a chocolate slab since the new cake couldn't accommodate the writing. For an upcharge. It all worked out in the end, without said upcharges, but this review shall remain a chilling reminder for those who expect white-glove service."}
