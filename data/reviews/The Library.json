{"text":"So disappointed.  Friend took me here for lunch.   I asked for hot tea and they had no tea bags. We ordered Wedding Soup and it was served lukewarm.  When we told the waitress - she didn't take it away.   She came back and said it is kept in a crock and they can't get it any warmer.  They don't even have a microwave to heat it up.  She took it away - ugh- I really wanted hot soup on a cold day.  I ordered the Steak Sandwich - it was ok. As I'm still eating, the waitress asks me if i want a box.   Her timing was way off.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent draft selection & $3.xx drafts (even the higher alc% beers)  with 1/2 price apps for happy hour.  Updates to the menu every couple of months, pretty good selection and execution, especially for the prices and if you consider it \"bar food\". The main appeal is the constantly-changing, well-varied draft selection.  Thankfully they don't waste tap space with Bud/Miller/Coors \"yellow water\", and they always have something to represent the broad spectrum of craft beers out there - IPA, Stout/Porter, Wheat, Ale, Belgian & seasonal.  Local beers are well represented, too.  If in some crazy way you aren't pleased by what's on tap, the bottle list is extensive and just as well-rounded.  Just don't be one of those tools that comes in during happy hour and gets a Miller lite without even having a taste of something on tap.  If you still find yourself craving your Miller lite, ask the bartender for a glass of water (it's free and is 98% the same thing)."}
{"text":"Crazy happy hour and late-night specials! This is one of the few places with an awesome (half-off) food special 9pm-1am with half-off craft draughts to compliment. The small plates that are on special for the happy hours are anything but small! I'm also a fan of Taco Tuesday... 3 of these babies with a beer is the best well-balanced lunch $6 can buy."}
{"text":"$3.25 drafts and half-priced apps at happy hour? Oh..you work until 7 and missed 5 -7 happy hour? Go to the SECOND happy hour from 9-ll PM.   I always order a beer and the Arabian Nights, which is a hummus dish that could easily feed three people. Another delish item on the menu are the nachos...huge n' cheesy portion size!   They have awesome outdoor seating area on the roof. BUT beware... if you sit with 6 or more people, gratuity will be added and the girl who ordered 30 dollars worth of waffle fries and $3.25 Pinnacle bombs will say she only owes 5 bucks and everyone will be down in the dumps.  The Library has me book, line and sinker. (I had to get one in.)"}
{"text":"3.5/5  We went on a Friday around 7:30 and we had great service! My friend and I split the nachos as an appetizer, and it was enough to be two meals. (We should have taken into account it said \"shared plates\") It probably had half a pound of beef on it! The beer cheese was better than anything ever. We couldn't get through most of our sandwiches! I ordered the fish sandwich and it was subpar. My friend loved the pork sandwich. Fries were good! The only problem was that the bathroom was disgusting. Both toilets were clogged and the floor was wet, trash all over the floor. I walked in and decided to wait until we went to the movie theatre."}
{"text":"My favorite bar I've been to in Pittsburgh. Came here to escape the chaos of south side and it did not disappoint. We hung out upstairs and watched the march madness games while playing pool and darts. The bartender put on every close game and was attentive the whole time, even though a private party was happening simultaneously. It was relaxed upstairs and the perfect break from the usual south side mayhem. All on a Friday night too. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was recently on one of my typical evening constitutionals when I happened about this establishment, and ducked in to borrow a copy of Algernon Charles Swinburne's Poems and Ballads.  However, instead of shelves full of great letters, this particular library was full of delicious food and ales.  Swinburne would have been beside himself!  Instead of remaining beside my own self, I tucked into their signature four pound plate of spare ribs, which practically jumped off the bone and onto my palate. Those ribs were quickly chased down by their thrice-fried coleslaw. I found it a bit peculiar that all of their beers were of Finnish origin, but at twenty-five cents a glass, who could resist??  It was not, nor ever will be, myself.  I wasn't able to tell if they had outdoor seating or not, but further visits will surely yield an answer to that query."}
{"text":"I've had to give some thought as to whether I wanted to give The Library 5-stars or not; it comes close. I might upgrade my rating after a few more visits. My first impression was this was going to be another so-so place when my wife suggested we try it. That quickly changed with the first appetizer (Our next time we will go between 5-7 when they are half priced) stuffed peppers. They were good. My wife ordered the chili. It was right up there, too. Very impressive and obviously home made.  I had the chicken breast and the wife had salmon. She really like the entree. My chick was a tad over cooked and more dried out than I would have preferred but it was still tasty.  The snow ball desert was wiped out quickly.  I am looking forward to more visits at The Library.  The price was decent and the place was clean... thumbs up on this one."}
{"text":"What a cool place-the menu is all LIBRARY ORIENTED by using Authors Names on menu items! Good place to go on a night out with friends or a 'date night' too"}
{"text":"This restaurant came to the South Side about a year ago and after many good reviews from friends, I was finally able to visit last month.  It was definitely worth the wait!    The interior is simplistic, but charming.  The menus are printed inside old books, and the table tops are a collage of book pages, maps, and newspapers.  It doesn't look like a library at all, but the atmosphere was still quaint and enjoyable.   Okay, now the food was fantastic!  Sometimes simpler menus are the best because you know the chefs are really good at what they're making.  Oh and the dishes all had book titles for names, surprise, surprise.  I highly recommend trying the sweet potato fries and their black bean hummus!   All of my family's entrees were excellent, so you can't go wrong with a dinner choice here.  Prices were pretty decent, too.    This place is an excellent addition to the Carson Street crawl and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Decent food and drink menu.  Nothing has been ridiculously amazing but everything has been solid.  Love the outdoor patio in the nice weather.  Service is also decent."}
{"text":"This restaurant experience was just followed by disappointment after disappointment.  First, our waitress took 10 minutes to take our order.  Then when our food arrived, cold and sloppily strewn on the plate, it was so poorly made, we couldn't even finish our meals.    When I gave our waitress our Groupon (because I would never actually pay for this food & service) the manager refused to take it because it was not printed out.  (Even though it could be easily scanned from my iPhone)    When asked to speak with the manager, a man in gym shorts finally came over to our table after 15 minutes.  He was rude, unapologetic, and unprofessional.  When I asked if he could make a note on my receipt so that I may bring my printed out Groupon the following day and receive a refund, he pulled out his personal cell phone and called the owner, because he could not make a decision.  When the owner did not answer, he said he would call me the following day with an answer.  It has been a week.  Save yourself some serious pain, and stay away from this tacky, over-priced, slum-of-a-restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for happy hours. Loved the cider beer. Tasted sweet like apple juice. Pork bbq sliders were not my favorite but the Simple Heart Cure with honey bbq and it was delicious. Probably not worth the full-price but for happy hour it was a great deal. Beer cheese and bacon fries with crispy chicken tenders and your choice of dipping sauce. Will be back for AYCEW night Tuesday $12.50 in the future!"}
{"text":"So when I step into the library there is nothing really that differentiates it from any other bar in the southside, maybe the pool table upstairs? There are no books or bookshelves that I saw, but the menu kind looks like a book so i guess it goes with the theme.  If you like $7 beers and $14 pepperoni rolls this is your place!!!!  So why would i give this place 2 stars then if its nothing special yet overpriced? HAPPY HOUR!  Its really the only time i would come here unless i was dragged in.  The beers come out to $3-4, the apps are half off ( and not bad) and they have a mix drink special usually with Pinnacle Vodka.    Unfortunately i think that 90% of the people that come here are in the same frame of mind as such it usually gets crowded during happy hour, so keep that in mind.   For all the choices you have in Southside I would not really recommend this place unless you come during happy hour. You can get the same atmosphere and people a block or two down the road at almost half the price"}
{"text":"Cool little place to get something to eat that's a decent price. Never ate here for dinner, but I think it's a great lunch stop. I like the \"literary theme\" of the menu, and the food was always tasty with a good range of options. No complaints and will return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh.  Awesome happy hour and fantastic food. Appetizers are half off during happy hour, also offering 3 dollar drafts. Amazing draft selection that changes frequently."}
{"text":"The Library has one of my favorite happy hours on Saturday nights:  Half off drafts and small plates from 9 to 11.  For 20 dollars I got a large plate of mussels, a Brooklyn Blast and two Southern Tier Chocolate Stouts.  I can't argue with a deal like that.  The food and beer list have always solid here.  The recent renovations of The Library have opened up the once constricted front bar area by removing the walls in between the pillars separating the dining area and the bar area.  The pool table has also made a move downstairs.  I think the overall vibe of first floor has changed for the better, giving it a more\" bar\" less \"I'm standing over someone while they are eating dinner\" vibe.  The upstairs can accommodate more hungry patrons now that the pool table has been removed as well.  I like how they have attempted to separate the \"I'm here to eat\" from the \"I'm here to booze\" crowd.  The Library is one of my favorite spots on Carson Street and I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I really liked it here! The food was surprisingly good and I tried a bloody Mary for the first time there and they made me a mini one before I committed to buying one (which I did). I thought that was super sweet. Definitely one of my favorite bars on the south side."}
{"text":"One of the better spots on Carson. Decent food/drafts and better than average atmosphere."}
{"text":"All the food is awesome and most of it is homemade... Definitely not freezer food. Bartenders are super friendly. Beer selection is always changing and always above average. Awesome happy hour deals. Overall good atmosphere. Highly recommend it for drinking AND eating."}
{"text":"Best bartender so far out of the 3 we've been to from out of town. Expected more with the decor (just from other reviews). The menu was cute with the theme! Came at 10pm  Sunday so HH drafts n lots of food 1/2 off. The pizza rolls were huge n awesome!!  Draft menu needs A LOT of work! But a great small selection! Clean place, nice clientele"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my Pittsburgh favs.  I've never had the pleasure of stopping here during a bar hop since Carson St. tends to irriate me in that vein, but I always have a great dinner/lunch/cocktail when I stop in. A little bit pricey for Pgh (and I'm semi-adjusted to NYC bar tabs), but I'm willing to pay for the clever decor and menu.   Cheers to you, The Library!"}
{"text":"The Library is one of my go to places  the South Side.   I have a frequent visitor of the Library for several years now.    First off is the food.  I have NEVER been disappointed here.  My favorites are the Thai Wings and the Alice in Wonderland.   Amazing flavor that never disappoints.  The sweet potato fries are a must have as well.   There is always a great selection of beers on draft - as well as great bottles as well.  The best thing about The Library: the fact that they offer a \"late\" happy hour from 9-11.  $3 drafts and 1/2 priced appetizers make me very happy.   Especially for the people like me who are always running a little late.    Check out the Library - you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Good wings and sandwiches.  Menu is smaller than when the opened a few years ago. Great atmosphere.  Definitely recommended in the summer to sit outside on the deck. Drinks etc are nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Look. I was going to the Library back when it first opened, and it was trying to be an upstanding, classy joint in the typically sleazy South Side bar crowd. Apparently that tactic failed miserably, because with each repeat visit, it's gotten sleazier and sleazier. The TVs are always on now with boxing or wrestling or some shit, and the waitresses have overly tight catchphrase t shirts and yinzer hair.   The food and cocktails still rule, but I felt compelled to note the downward trends at the Library since the last time I went the service sucked complete ass. (Eloquently put, I know. But why bother trying when this joint has quit trying too?)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, open late on a Sunfay, great food. Let me taste several microbrewery before ordering a pint, gladly moved me to a location where I could plug in. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Attended a group function at the Library last week and really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.  We had an assortment of appetizers which were all great and I had a turkey sandwich with a fried egg for dinner that was delicious.  We were outside on their rooftop deck and the weather decided to cooperate!  The drinks were great as well.  At least what I remember of them after a few..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place became trendy and it lost its nerd factor by blaring the TV's in the bar area instead of embracing its library-quality in the dining room.  I go back infrequently, but used to come weekly.  I would walk 500 miles barefoot for the sweet potato fries and jalapeno aioli.  The entrees are boring; go for a giant salad and add on another meat or portobellos or a sandwich - I've had 'em all, they all rock, especially the Prime Rib.  The appetizers are the real menu standouts; you can't go wrong with any of them.  5 stars if it wern't so bar-oriented and trendy now."}
{"text":"4.0 / 5 - Burger: Delicious, juicy, wonderfully cooked.  Fun atmosphere and decor, though a bit loud for a library."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best bars on Carson Street.  Its laid back and has a great vibe to it.  Really good for dinner or late night drinks.  Great happy hour here and some of my favorite wings in the city.    Try the wings, sliders and their huge calzones!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way out of Pittsburgh for a few beers. We saw that they had the Bells Hearted Hop Slam on draft, which we had just tried elsewhere the night prior. it was just opening on a Sunday, and we lucked out and hit happy hour. We were the first to arrive, but the place soon filled with people. Their draft list was decent, and we loved that they had pool and darts. We ended up staying for the entire happy hour(s)!  We'll definitely be stopping by again when we make another trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We visited Pittsburgh for a few days and were in search of some comfort food.  We looked to our friendly yelp app and The Library popped up.  Not only is the food good you can play pool and darts too.  Big TVs for sports watchers. The Hamburger was amazing.  They have fries and tator tots which were yummy.  The pizza is deep dish with the best toppings.  I'm not a wing person, but my friend is and she loved them.  I would say it was my favorite food we had while visiting."}
{"text":"The monster cheese is without a doubt the best bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich I had had in my life. They have a good list of draft beers but they cost on average $7 for one. The tots are crispy and cooked to perfection every time that I go. Service can be slow sometimes but they have some great happy hour deals!"}
{"text":"Good place to meet up with a few friends to catch up and get a drink.  Half off apps and certain mixed drinks from 9pm-1am on saturdays"}
{"text":"Amazing establishment! not only does the craft beer selection vary from week to week, but the food is great as well. Their happy hour prices are more than fair, and it is far enough from the \"wild\" part of south side to where you can actually hear yourself talk to the person you are sitting next to. It is a great location to relax and enjoy yourself. But most importantly, all of the bartenders are not only personable, but they are also knowledgeable about their beer selections and passionate in their great explanations. It's a bit of a drive from the suburbs, but we make sure to get there 1-2 times a week....well worth it!"}
{"text":"the library was a really exciting concept to me. i'm a writing major, so anything that pays homage to literature makes me smile.  the food was absolutely excellent [i had the 'arabian nights' hummus plate and the 'animal farm' sandwich] definitely awesome for mid-range pittsburgh fare. the menu was pretty cute.  the only thing that disappointed me was the decor. i wanted there to be more books around!   everything was excellent, and i will surely return."}
{"text":"My name is Hitt, I'm from Pittsburgh PA.  I do many things but one of the things I like to do is experience everything I humanly can from foods to places plus people and things.  Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...  This place?   Go here. The beer could of been colder. The food was decent. The staff was nice. We went at 11pm. Read a book.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Love this place for their late night bites special. From 9pm-1am small plates (appetizers) are half off. I recommend the peperoni roll-lots of cheese, peperoni and delicious tomato dipping sauce. The waitress kindly let us know that this and the pizza another person is our group ordered would take longer since they bake them fresh. Great place to go with a large group. There is always plenty of room to get table with the upstairs bar as well.  Love the atmosphere of a library inside a bar!"}
{"text":"We stayed downtown for the weekend to catch a Pirates game and, strangely, everything downtown closes at 9pm or so. When we got in town at 9, our dinner options were limited. So, we headed to the Library. The reviews on Yelp are mixed and, I agree. We had some good food (pepperoni roll, tater tots) and average food (nachos) and some poor service. The waitress was friendly but really slow. It was there happy hour so the food was 1/2 off. While they have a large beer selection was large in bottles, their draft selections were less impressive. It seemed to be all IPAs. I did get a nice bottle of chocolate milk stout though.   Overall, the Library was fine and I wouldn't say our visit was bad. It was just average."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of the South Side- the crowds are usually younger, the bars louder, and people get a little too crazy on the weekends. However, I have to say that I enjoyed coming to this place for a beer and some food last night. I was surprised at how extensive the menu was, and while I missed the happy hour by 15 minutes, the beer selection was pretty decent. I got a vegetable calzone which was insanely big coupled with a huge bowl of marinara sauce (oh yeah). I was able to sit upstairs on the patio, which was much more quiet and laid back. They even had a pool table and dart board upstairs. On the whole, a nice place to stop in for beer and above average bar food."}
{"text":"Went to the late night happy hour last night and ordered the pepperoni rolls. They were amazing! There was enough for two people to share. The only downside to the evening was that our waitress (who was very nice) kept messing up our drink orders and sometimes we couldn't find her to order more drinks. I do not think this was entirely her fault. I think that they were short staffed."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food. Great prices. It doesn't get much better for a casual night out. I recommend the Gunslinger."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few drinks around 4:30 PM on Friday, March 2. Atmosphere was what we were looking for, but the bartender was as useless as a house cat.   We were able to get our first drink, but couldn't get a second because the bartender decided she wanted to talk to her friend instead of doing any work. There was also a group of 4 or 5 people that walked in just before we needed our second drink and they seemed to be having the same problem. Saw her poor one beer for them before she went back to her conversation with her friend at the service area of the bar.   Guess she'd rather serve $3 drafts than $26 double Obans. Wonder what the owners would think of her service decisions?  So, I got up and walked to the service area of the bar to interrupt the bartender's conversation with her friend, which had been going on for several minutes, to request the bill. Even at that point, she continued her conversation while finally making some type of drink with Bombay gin for the group. Then, she came down to the end of the bar and stood there looking at me - no check in hand, so she probably didn't even ring up our drinks.   She looked at me as if to say, where is your payment when I didn't even know how much the bill was. I asked and she told me the amount with a disgusted look on her face like I was supposed to know how much the bill was. She finally told me the price. We paid and left.   I will not return. I'm sick and tired of shitty service and his bartender sets the bar pretty high for shitty service."}
{"text":"It's expensive, the cocktails are crazy, the menu is not so extensive. But i like it.  I like the outdoor seating. I like the silly book related names for the food and drinks.  And their appetizers are awesome."}
{"text":"Unpretentiously cool and... Good! Quick. Easy. Good quality. Relatively cheap. I got the portobella mush sand and it was excellent. Not normally too big a fan of roasted red peppers but the ones on my sandwich were spectacular. Definitely a neat vibe. The menus are re-used books of various kinds. Mine was the volcano and earthquake book."}
{"text":"We had take out from here. We were in the process of taking care of a lot of things so we didn't even eat it as soon as we got it back to our place. The food was still perfect even after sitting.."}
{"text":"I went to The Library on Saturday around 4:30pm with my 3 children (all under 21 but 2 could pass as being older). Let me preface this by saying this wasn't my first time here with my kids. The place was relatively empty. We were greeted by a waitress dressed a Dolly Parton and given menus. Within minutes another waitress demanded to see all of our ID's. I kindly explained to her that we didn't intend on ordering alcohol but she insisted and referred to the sign at the door stating you had to be 21 to even be in the restaurant. Again, I told her that this never happened on our past visit and we were all a bit shocked at the policy and her attitude. She was adamant about the rules so we got up and left. I stopped to read the sign she spoke of at the door and it clearly stated that you had to be 21 UNLESS ACCOMPANIED BY A PARENT!!!!! We ended up at another restaurant down the street which was awesome. On the way back to my car, I felt compelled to go back in and tell both the waitress and manager that the sign did not reflect her rant and that her rude behavior was neither appreciated or warranted as I was over 21 and she never asked if the others were my children. She insisted she did apologize (in a snarky condescending kind of way) and said there was a \"communication issue\" which is when I asked her to read aloud the sign.  There are so many great eating establishments in Pittsburgh and this episode lead me to find a new one which I intend on visiting on my next trip. I do not care how good your food is or isn't. If you treat your customers disrespectfully than you deserve a poor review."}
{"text":"Well I knew right from the start that The Library was going to get a good review from me.  It has my favorite type of food atmosphere - the restaurant slash (NON-SMOKING) bar.  I like the bar side for the casual and laid back atmosphere and of course the restaurant half guarantees a good variety of food. But now I have to be honest and say that I've only eaten one thing each time I've gone there.  And that would be the chicken wings.  And that's because they're amazing.  They've definitely become my favorite wings in Pittsburgh.  And I'm a girl who likes her wings.  They're a really nice size for wing dings and the price is right.  I always get the garlic parm (my fav) and they come with an absolutely delicious crispy outside.  I LOVE me a crispy, crunchy wing.  I have no doubt that much more of their food is equally as yummy, but I'll probably never find out.  I'll be too busy eating wings."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't left a review for The Library yet! I've been coming here for a number of years now, but more recently my husband and I have been coming a lot for Monday's $1 tacos and both their normal and late happy hours.   It seems there a lot of mixed reviews but I absolutely love The Library. You really cannot beat their happy hour specials. Half off all craft beer drafts and half off all small plates. The beer selection is always good. It's not super extensive but they usually have something for everybody on tap. I think their food is really delicious. I haven't had some of the items other people are saying aren't that great, but I have never been disappointed with the food here.  My favorite small plates to get are the Billy Goat's Gruff (stuff poblano peppers), Marco Polo (pepperoni rolls), and the Frida Kahlo (nachos). When we go for happy hour we typically get two small plates to share and it's always more than enough food for dinner. Anytime you have an option of meat (nachos, tacos, etc) I always recommend the pulled pork. Whatever sauce they use is delicious.   Their regular food is also really great. I'm usually partial to the sandwiches and wraps. The Blackened Canteen and Last Queen of Hawaii are really good. I love going on Mondays for $1 taco night. Most places that have taco night usually just do the typical dry beef, cheap tacos, but here you get your choice of shrimp, pork, sausage or chicken. You can also get a spicy sour cream drizzle that gives the tacos extra flavor. Definitely raises the bar for taco night!  The servers are always very friendly. Depending on the night the service can be slow sometimes, but I never mind because I really just love hanging out here. The 2nd floor back patio is wonderful when it's warm out.   The Library is definitely one of my favorite Southside places! I'll keep coming back for the great happy hour prices and delicious food."}
{"text":"Their decor and atmosphere are one of the best themed bars here in Pittsburgh in my opinion, however if they kept up with the decor it'd be even better. For someone who is in the restaurant business, never not once have I seen a bar or restaurant with plastic on their windows, except for my own home. That honestly bothered me, and not only that I may be the worst quest but at least im helping you tear off the rest of the ripped pages from books covering your tables. Yeah I'm that girl, focused on one part that was missing a page visibly and made the table look rough and need lovin' I helped out the store and began to tear a little, not a lot, but a little. I stopped myself from being completely rude and devouring the table and one big swoop of a rip.  Their beer selections are out of the world, and may require some particular taste buds, but they show plenty of variety. As for the food, I've had better bar food. I had their \"Arabian Nights\" which is vegetables, black bean hummus, and regular hummus (I think), pita bread, and vegetables, powdered with paprika. Seriously the black bean hummus, was the star of the plate. I've experienced better, my beer however which has to long of a name to remember, and I honestly think I let my friend order it for me, was good reminded me of a blue moon, with a lesser value citrus hint. I did start out with a coffee stout, and this is where I went wrong stouts are particularly thicker, and I do not care for thick beer. It had an overall good taste but the thickness threw me off. I would really love to try though a coffee styled beer, let the suggestions role.....  I've been here once before and loved the atmosphere and theme, I just wish they would keep up with the decor, as for the food well. Mehhhh do what ya want."}
{"text":"I really love the concept of the place, definitely living up to its name--The Library. The menu is organized in chapters (like a book) and each entrée is named after a literary classic. Unlike other bars in Southside, The Library has a very sophisticated, but yet relaxing atmosphere. There are plenty of seats and tables for dining and drinking. The service was wonderful and tons of food/drink specials for those on a budget.   I came here in time for their happy hour special, which included half priced appetizers. Had the chance to try the Arabian Nights, a plate filled with pita bread, fresh veggies, black beans and red peppers hummus, and the Renegade, fresh breadsticks with marinara sauce. Even for the appetizers, the portions are huge! The hummus was amazing and probably one of the best I've ever tried. The breadsticks were warm and fluffy with a hint of garlicky goodness dipped in steamy marinara sauce.   Overall, The Library is definitely a unique part of the Southside scene. I love the concept and amazing food! Give this place a try and embrace your inner nerd!"}
{"text":"The best happy hour on East Carson for foodies and \"beer-ies\" (that's a word, right?) alike.  Half price drafts (5-7, 10-12) and half price apps (5-7, 9-1) means there's rarely ever an unhappy hour.  A laid back atmosphere where you can enjoy your favorite local sports game, a round of pool (or two), and the witty literary inspired dishes.    I highly recommend the Book of Mussels (both red and white) and A Tale of Ginger and Pickles (deep fried pickles slices served with a great, drippy ranch). For beer? Their drafts are constantly changing and never disappointing.  Also it'll make your family, friends, and co-workers alike think that you're constantly at your scholastic endeavors since you always seem to be on your way to The Library."}
{"text":"Missed Happy Hour by 15 minutes, and you could definitely tell because we had to wait for a high top, and by the time we sat down, the place cleared out. Happy Hour is from 5pm-7pm and 10pm-midnight. They offer half off small plates and $4 Drafts and a Pinnacle Vodka drinks and bombs special. It's awesome that a place offers two Happy Hours, but when you miss them, it's a little bit of a let down.  The food wasn't bad...I've had better, and it took a little while for it to be served. The names of the selections were pretty cool and so was the library book menu. I had \"The Last Queen of Hawaii\" which was a BBQ grilled chicken wrap. The french fries were mediocre, and the portions were about average compared to other bars and restaurants.  The beer list was pretty good, and they offered about 10 or so on tap.   The atmosphere is decent. I'm into bars/restaurants that have more of a rustic/dark lighting look to them, and this just wasn't quite doing it for me. We also came in cold weather, and I would consider returning during Happy Hour and sitting on the porch upstairs. I didn't get the chance to check out upstairs while I was there but plan to when I return."}
{"text":"I came here for a late night snack. I ordered the honey Cajun wings. There were only 10 customers when I arrived. The wings took over 40 mins to arrive. When they came they were still hot. The flavor was sweet and salty. It was a good combo. I would give this place 4 stars but waiting over 40 mins for wings was a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Trivia on tuesday was fun, and the half off apps during happy hour are definitely a reason to come. The wings and quesadilla are my favorite. The beer selection and happy hour prices are also a draw, and you're encouraged to try any of their eclectic beers before buying, a very cool option."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best bars in the city, and certainly in South Side.  Depending on the time of day, you'll get a very different crowd.  Because it's in a prime Carson Street location, college kids overrun the bar on Saturday nights.  But otherwise, The Library is fairly laid back.  There is always a good selection of local beers on tap--East End, Penn, Victory (from across the state in Downingtown).  Happy hours are every day (5-7pm & 9-11pm) with 1/2 off apps and $3 drafts.  Another perk is that the kitchen is open until 1am, and the food is actually good.  I've tried most of the menu, and the closest thing I have to a complaint is that the portions are large.  For example, The Woman in White (risotto) could easily feed two.  And, yes, all of the menu options and cocktails are named for books.  The signature cocktails are more of simple twists on classics--Where the Red Fern Grows is just a cosmo with pineapple juice--and disappointingly cheap liquor is used.  But I come here for the drafts, not the Hugtini (yep, a cocktail made with that childhood sugar-water).  The menus themselves are retired hardback books--the decor is top-notch here.  The patio on the top floor is great for warmer months."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I do enjoy it but I usually don't go out of my way to come here. The food is okay, especially after/during a night of drinking but I always expect it to be better than it is.   The best this is that currently all of their drafts are $4 all the time so you don't break the bank, and they usually have a pretty varied selection of drafts. Additionally, during their happy hour (which is every day of the week 5-7!) their \"small plates\" are half off. Sadly, they used to be cheaper to begin with so you're still paying a decent amount for a small plate.   Overall, if a friend chooses to go here or if Im in the area I definitely don't say no, but I don't really go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"The Library is wonderful!!! 1/2 price appetizer are excellent especially the mini burgers and meat and cheese platter. I love how they made me my favorite drink!!!! The menu's are books that you can keep at your table. Also they have recently started having West Coast Swing upstairs in Wednesday nights. Awesome."}
{"text":"Great place. Bar can get packed but usually pretty tame. Not enough taps but good rotation of beers. Used to have a little better specials for food but no complaints. Wings are decent, and pizza is good. Maybe not a true 5, I'd go 4.5 but I like it so I rounded up, deal with it."}
{"text":"The Library is quintessential Carson Street - a crowded, noisy restaurant full of local twentysomethings and a menu full of bar food. What makes it unique is its pseudo-intellectual theme. The walls and windows are lined with dusty hardcover classics, and the menus are printed in vintage picture books. Menu items are named for literature greats, with titles like Edgar Allan Potatoes and The Fairest Fowl.  This effort at individualism makes me prefer The Library to other run-of-the-mill South Side bars. It's nice not to constantly experience the same sports-oriented, testosterone-driven atmosphere. The food isn't great but it's not bad either, and definitely hits the spot after a night of drinking. Another perk of The Library is that the kitchen is open until 1am, significantly later than most area establishments.   My top criteria for a great dining experience is that al fresco seating be available in the warmer months. Not only does The Library provide ample sidewalk seating, but it has a sweet roof deck! If you're in the area and are in the mood for some \"Ginger and Fried Pickles\" I'd recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"This all applies only to the unlimited wings nights Tuesday and Sunday. I only know what the wings taste like.  This is at the highest echelon of wing dining. Along with quaker steak the unlimited wings deal here is excellent. $12 for like 14 DIFFERENT flavors of wings. Big fresh meaty wings not frozen crap. Cooked when you order. Brought out in a couple minutes. These guys really know their stuff.   I've been here 3 times in 5 months. And I'll definitely be back often.  The only thing to be aware of is trivia night. If they are doing trivia it takes the whole second floor. It lasts at least 2 hours and is loud and obnoxious if you aren't playing. You can't talk because in between questions they play loud music. So if you don't want that, sit downstairs where the vibe is energetic and talkable. Don't complain about what is posted. Don't like trivia? Don't come to trivia night.  Anyway. Excellent wings. Excellent prices. And oh yeah, the servers really know what beer is available and make informed recommendations. I can't drink, but my friends said the descriptions were right on and the taste was great. They also let you try a little sample to see if you'd want it.  Great place!  Jason's rank order list of Pittsburgh Wings (updated occasionally): - (tie) Quaker Steak (Robinson) - buffet tuesdays - (tie) The Library (Carson) - buffet tuesdays and sundays - Quaker Steak (Pleasant Hills) - buffet tuesdays - Fat Head's (Carson) - 60c Mondays"}
{"text":"Wow Pittsburgh, you have impressed me. Where else can you get huge portions of good food and creative cocktails at a reasonable price? I did not care for the \"Alice in Wonderland\" (portobello mushroom sandwich), but I really liked the \"Moby Dick\" (cod sandwich) and the \"Hunter Thompson\" (pasta). The onion rings were really delicious and different from ones I've had in the past. Also make sure to get the sweet potatoe fries (like I had to even tell you, how does one not order them if they are available?) I had the \"James and the Giant Peach\" (long island iced tea) which was super huge. It was absolutely delicious! Did I mention that it was like $7-8?! That is unheard of in LA or NY! Yes, happy hour prices are awesome too. Sam Adams summer ale for $3? Please sir, I'd like some more!"}
{"text":"I went to Pittsburg back in April so this is an old review that never was published.   Maybe they're great for happy hour but their hospitality was lacking!!! We walked in to grab a bite for lunch and not even one of the servers acknowledged our presence. We grabbed the menu after sitting at the table for a little while and still NOT one person acknowledged our presence! The menu was lame, it was like printed paper glued down to the first couple of pages of old books. We decided that it was not worth our time and money and walked out. Never ever going back, not if it was the last place open."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a whim before going to the movie. Because I love books, I was intrigued by the name. I like the interior, as there are plenty of books and book paraphernalia around to pique my interest.  I had the hummus wrap, and of course, fried pickles to start. The food was just okay, but I did enjoy the atmosphere.   I would like to come back for happy hour, because it seems like it would be fun. Also, the menu is huge, so I'm sure there are more things on the menu I should try."}
{"text":"The Library is a great bar on the South Side... Unlike some others in the area which are the essence of dives, or sort of a mess, The Library presents a casual, relaxed atmosphere to have a bite to eat and a beer (or two). They have great Happy Hour specials (I think we enjoyed $3.00 drafts when I was there) and an impressive selection of microbrews and domestic and imported bottled beers - The beers are presented in bound menus with cool descriptions and the variety is really awesome. The Library theme is enjoyable, though there is hardly a library's worth of books inside. Instead, there's a scattering of bookshelves along with TVs broadcasting games and an easy-going crowd.   The Library is actually pretty large too. There's actually an upstairs area with billiards, games and an outdoor terrace, so you've got lots of options for places to sit too. It was blessedly uncrowded when I was there on a Saturday night in September and my friend and I had a great time. Though I haven't been to other bars in the South Side area, this is definitely a great choice for those looking for a more casual (conversation-appropriate) venue to have some drinks and fun night out."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  Great drink deals, menu has plenty of variety and I love the happy hour menu.  Best place in town to play billiards or watch a game."}
{"text":"I am all in on The Library.  They have a great beet selection with a sweet happy Hour which includes food and drink.  The menu is diverse and can please most eaters.  (Although, I do miss the children's book menus."}
{"text":"Really great happy hour!  I enjoyed my time here the other night and would make a return visit especially for the happy hour which is every day, and twice a day!  Their draft selection is limited, I believe about 10-12 but I was able to find something good, though I started off with a Manhattan, and it was just ok.  We ordered rather quickly after getting our drinks and was enjoying watching the Pen's game on one of their big screen TV's in the downstairs bar.  In the past I have hung out on the outside patio and recall that being nice.  They have two pool tables and big tables for larger parties, which I especially noticed while checking out the upstairs.  Being a Saturday evening, and in the middle of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the place was pretty busy.  We sat at a high table right behind the bar, which was good for the most part until people started gathering directly in front of you.  The crowd is pretty young, and was getting younger as the night progressed.  So a couple more drinks and we are still waiting for our food.  Although I was hungry this didn't really bother me too much since I had beer and the game to distract me.  It only seemed to come to my attention when I realized it had been about 30-40 minutes since we ordered.  Shortly thereafter the food arrived.  I ordered the Book of Mussels.  The mussels were good, and tasted pretty fresh but the sauce was really milky.  The menu said it was a white wine sauce.  It sure did seem like a cream based sauce.  It also only came with two small pieces of toast.  I might have asked for more, but that sauce wasn't really tempting me to soak it all up.    I was still hungry afterwards, probably because it was late and I had only had breakfast that day.  I was tempted to order off the small plate happy hour special but ended up declining the thought.  All in all, I enjoyed it, food was descent, service was ok, and the specials were great."}
{"text":"The Library unlike the actualy library of which I will always be a life long fan. I fell out of love with this resturant.    My fling with the Library lasted for about two months.  I came to the realization that the flavors here, weren't enough, to keep me traveling all the way from the Northside.    Maybe in the summer when traveling is easier will I have another meal here.  I like that the menu items are named after book titles but very little is done with the food that inspires me to come back for more.   I am not a fan of eating at places that have sliders on the menu."}
{"text":"they put cinnamon on their nachos... with melted cheese, a creamy cheese sauce, jalapeños, black beans and salsa. asked the waitress if it was normal. she said yes. i feel like if it is a normal thing it should be added to the description on the menu..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a kitchen that was open late night, and we found that and more at the Library.  From 9-11 pm small plates are half price, what a deal.  We tried the mussels, which were good, the fried pickle, the pork sliders and the hamburger sliders, all very tasty.    Get selection of beers on tap, including a \"Mystery Beer.\"  This place is lots of fun."}
{"text":"Since moving to the Southside in 2010, the Library has always been a favorite of mine.  They have one of the best happy hours on Carson Street, in my thirsty and hungry opinion.  $3 drafts and 1/2 price appetizers from 5-7p and 9-11p.  Their appetizer (small plates) menu has changed quite a bit over the years, but it currently has a TON of offerings and you'll surely find something to suit everyone in your party.    I highly recommend the pickle chips, pulled pork sliders, and the sausage tacos.  I have yet to try an actual entree here, but when I do,  I'll be sure to update.  My only complaint stemmed from a recent trip to watch the USA World Cup games.  For some reason, they won't play the audio from the TVs. So for one of the biggest sporting events in the country, we had to listen to Carly Ray Jepsen and Sugar Ray on the speakers.  They told us that its an issue with their sound system and it doesn't allow them to play the audio from the TVs.  When the game went into extra time, we quickly paid our checks and moved to another bar down the street.  I'll definitely be back to visit and eat, however, the Library won't be my first choice for sporting events."}
{"text":"Great food and really good service. Staff was friendly and attentive. The music and atmosphere were enjoyable. The place was clean and inviting. Definitely one of the FEW Pitts establishments with good service. It's certainly not Cleveland but this place was good! Go here!"}
{"text":"The library's theme is such a cool concept. Books in the windows, appetizers have book names and book pages on the tables. The plates are even shaped like books! So cool.   As much as I like the concept of this place, I only come here to eat or drink if a special is going on or if I have a groupon or living social. Their happy hour is pretty awesome. We went last night around 9:20 and after 9 all small plates are half off. I didn't feel like waiting until 10 for drafts to be half off, so I ordered myself a beer. They print you out an updated version of their draft list when you sit down which is pretty convenient. I ordered helltown rapture IPA which was pretty tasty!  For an appetizer we ordered fried pickles. Originally they ask for $9.50 but with the special they were $4.75.. Which is awesome because they are not worth more than $5. They literally are pickle chips that are breaded. They honestly aren't very good, but if you are craving fried pickles like I always am- they will do the job. They are definitely not the best fried pickles I have ever had- too salty and greasy and I hate that they are pickle chips( I prefer spears or fresh cut pickles).   My boyfriend ordered their pulled pork sliders from their small plates and enjoyed them. The coleslaw on them really complements the pulled pork. I went all out since we had the living social for $25 and it was half off small plates... I ordered a veggie quesadilla ($5.25 normally $10.50) and also their pepperoni rolls (around $7 normally over $14!) . The quesadilla I have had before and love! The chipotle sour cream they drizzle on too is awesome and really makes the quesadilla. They don't fall apart and they are full of flavor. The pepperoni rolls were thick! You get 4 in an order which is pretty awesome. I literally could only eat 1 , they were so big! Stuffed with pepperoni but they could have been more cheesy! Not bad for $7 but not worth $14.   The library is deserving of 3.5 stars but I rounded up. It's a cool place to check out, but like I said, go during a happy hour to get the most for your money! And check out their patio upstairs!"}
{"text":"Im stuck between a 4-5 rating. Lets just go with 4.5. For someone who loves beer, such as myself, this place is hard to beat. Sure, there may be better beer selections in the city, but ill take whatever drafts they have for half off EVERY day of the week from 5-7 and 10-midnight. I havent found a late night or weekend happy hour with a decent craft beer selection, so this was quite a surprise. \"Small plates\" are also half off from 5-7 and 9-1. The food is decent, nothing special. Had the pork nachos,  and the pork was on the sweet side. For half off, i can't complain. The one thing that this place differs from my other happy hour spots, and most Pittsburgh bars in general, is that they have a pool table!! Two happy hours EVERY day of the week plus pool?? Count me in as a regular!!"}
{"text":"The Library is your standard south side bar / restaurant.  They go for a literary theme, but eh?  The beer and spirits selection is good.  The prices are good.  The food is your standard Sysco bar food.  Their happy hour special is pretty good.  The crowd is typically decent.  I've never felt like I was surrounded by idiots.  This is your standard south side bar."}
{"text":"Awesome place that I somehow avoided until now.  I have to just ask myself why?  Stupid me, stupid stupid me.  I was totally fascinated by the menu and had some find making the connections of the titles to the food.  Most of the items I wanted to order was only because I could say that I ate that 'book.'  Ultimately I decided on the 'Brave New World.'  What an amazing idea to place the burger IN a quesadilla!  Less bun, more meat flavor.  The burger was cooked to perfection and a decent size at that, it almost filled out the tortillas.  Mozzarella and cheddar cheese, some spicy mayo, and pico de gallo.  Talk about a fiesta in your mouth.  This is definitely a burger that you have to eat with a fork.  There is no way you could really pick this up unless you are wearing gloves and bib.  It's messy, but messy in a very good way.    Instead of going with the hand cut fries, I wanted the tots.  Let's face it, I'm a tots fan.  And for the $1 up charge, I wasn't too upset.  The portion size of the tots was big.  And they came out in their own little container thing.  Oh my, I was so consumed by the thought of that burger still in my head that I almost forgot the appetizer.  We ordered 'A Tale of Ginger and Pickles,' I mean who in their right mind would want to pass up breaded fried pickles.  If you've never had them before, you must try them.  Who knew that frying certain items would be a delight to your taste buds?  The atmosphere in here can be categorized as a loud library with a pool table...and beer.  Lots of beer.  I especially like that they give you a list of the drafts on tap for that day with your menus.  I had me two while I was here and I must say, it's liberating to drink in a library.  The staff were accommodating.  When we got there we sat at a high top table and soon decided to move because we were afraid the table was going to fall over.  No problem to them.  They came by often to make sure we had everything we needed.    The most awesome thing I think I liked about this place were the plates.  They were shaped like books.  I mean like an open book.  Food sat inside them so you really were 'reading a book.'"}
{"text":"LIBRARY. THEMED. BAR.   Books everywhere. Great happy hour and huge selection."}
{"text":"I loved the building and the waitstaff.  Got the Grapes of Wrath, which was good but had no hint of basil.  Nice drink specials.  Menu leaves much to be desired if you have dietary restrictions. Waitress was so sweet she ran my cardigan out to me in the rain.  Can't ask for better!"}
{"text":"Since the first time I visited, I've been back three or four times more, and I've gotten a different meal each time. Considering I normally order the same thing everytime I go to a restaurant, a LOT of the Library's choices have appealed to me.  My favorite so far? The Scarlet Letter: cheese-filled tortellini (my favorite pasta) with a tomato cream sauce (my favorite pasta sauce). The portion is HUGE, too. It's big enough for three servings, and tastes just as good reheated as leftovers. Believe me--it tastes AWESOME.  I have also had the Jules Vern, which is basically a philly cheese steak.  The Slaughter House Four--four slider burgers--tastes pretty good, too.  I'll be back again =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I and our 2 year old son went last Friday.  The food and service were great! I wrote a blog post about it if you want to read more details:  http://crayonsanddrywall.com/2014/09/18/the-library-restaurant-review/"}
{"text":"Oh, Library, how I love thee!! Happy hour EVERYDAY from 5 - 7 and 9 - 11 with $3 draft, $3 energy bombs, and 1/2 off apps.  Are you for real Jill, you ask.  Yes, yes, good sir, I am. Their tap selection extends way beyond Miller and Bud Light, which I appreciate, and they have the best fried pickles I've had in Pittsburgh.  Plus, they have a bartender who looks just like Charlie Day and can sling drinks like a pro."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town, great beers and appetizers, and awesome service. Our go-to place. Nowhere else is close."}
{"text":"I live on 21st st in the Southside and the Library is definitely my favorite bar to go watch a game and grab some cheap beers/food. The best thing about the Library is they have an every day Happy Hour. From 9-1 they have 1/2 of drafts (ALL craft beers on a rotating schedule which I greatly appreciate). From 10-1 they have 1/2 off small plates and usually another special like $1.00 tacos on Monday Night.  The service is always great, the food comes out quick and is delicious and the beer selection is top notch! I highly recommend coming here during the week, or even on the weekend. The crowd is usually a mix of college students or young professionals, but never is this place a bar that is over packed with annoying college kids."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better wing joints in Pittsburgh and its great that they have a wing night on Sunday (and another wing night on Tuesday!)! Now their wing night is AYCE for $12.50 currently, which is a decent deal, but you'll probably need to put away at least 18 to make it worth it compared to other deals. Of course one of the good parts about AYCE is you can try to try many of their delicious wing flavors, but they do have a five wing minimum per flavor and will only allow you to order 10 wings up front. After that, you have to order in 5 wing batches. Blue cheese and ranch are reasonable at 50 cents each. One of the really cool things about their wing night as well is that you can get the wings naked or breaded! I don't know of another place that gives you this option.  I have been here a few times for wing nights, nothing else, and therefore have tried a number of the flavors. The sauces I can recommend and which are probably their hottest flavors are Dante's Inferno and Cajun (which is wet). Both are delicious and actually really aren't that hot at all, but taste great. Next up, spicy BBQ, Buffalo Ranch, and Buffalo Bleu are all pretty solid as well. An OK flavor would be their Buffalo Garlic Parmesan, which is nice, but it uses shredded Parmesan, instead of sprinkled, and it is not caked on the wing like you would find at Fat Heads. I would not recommend their Thai sauce if you are looking for that sweet and spicy chili Thai flavor, as it taste more like honey BBQ (which is OK, but not what I am expecting).  As you can tell, I only have done the wings here, because I have only come on AYCE wing nights and they are good wings. They rank up there with, but maybe not quite as good as Bigham's Tavern and Fat Heads. The rest of menu sounds like its pretty good and maybe one day I'll venture off the beaten path, but I really like the wings. As for other takeaways, this place is pretty easy to find a table on Sunday nights and if you can get here for happy hour you can get some good drinks at great prices."}
{"text":"The waitress we had was attentive, as were the bartenders. If you go during happy hour you can get two really nice beers for around $7. The problem with happy hour is that it is VERY crowded, so do not go with a large group if you're trying to sit down for a meal. The hostess working when I went was unhelpful, rude, and completely clueless. After the way my group was treated by her I have no plans of going back."}
{"text":"I dig this place!  I dont think people know how good their food is!  Its a great bar, the atmosphere is very cool and they have a great beer list -- although they often sell out of some of the seasonal craft beers but that's to be expected.  I love their book themed menu.  The mussels are delicious, and the last time we were there I had the Sea Captain and his Wife, salmon with vegetables and a starch. Its always very good.  This is a fun bar to dine at, equally fun to drink and play pool at.  I'm never disappointed when we end up here."}
{"text":"I've only eaten appetizers here but they are awesome. Huge portions- one app is enough for 1.5 meals. Appetizer happy hour is the way to go. The drinks are probably good- there's a very creative selection- but I'm not a drinker so I don't know for sure. Go upstairs if you can- cuts down on noise and cluster."}
{"text":"We will not be back. A group of friends and I went to the Library and were greeted with the most fowl tempered bartender I have ever encountered. No greeting at the bar, just an \"ID\" and and eyeroll, she took my card to start a tab and that was that. Every drink ordered after that was just as uncomfortable. This was the same with all the members of our group.   I think the bartender forgot she works at a bar called the library, not the actually library.  Apparently we were being too loud on a Friday night for her and instead of coming out to ask us to quiet down a little bit SHE THREW ICE FROM BEHIND THE BAR and hit someone that was just standing there. That was her way of dealing with the situation and paying customers.   Really the food and deals are not worth the poor service.  I assume from reading other reviews the woman in question is a Manager- I hope the owner understands how having someone like this can affect their business."}
{"text":"I've gone to The Library many times and I've gotten great food every time.  Last night was no exception.  I ordered the Catch-22 with tots (and yes I'm going to eat my tots).  First off, just let me say that I love the fact that you can get tator-tots instead of fries.  The Library always makes them crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.  Perfect.  I ordered the buffalo chicken version of the Catch-22 and it was cooked perfectly.  The homemade pizza crust was crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside.  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  The hot sauce and cheese finished off this delicious piece of win, which I had no problem finishing off.  The only reason I can't give The Library a 5 star rating is that I've had some pretty slow service on several occasions.  I'm not sure if the kitchen was just backed up, but the food seemed to take quite a while to make it to the table.  Last night that did not happen, but it has happened in the past.  I also appreciate the fact that they put money back into the place to make it better.  The plates look like open books now, which is a nice touch, and even though the menus are not in books anymore, they are nice new menus with a couple new items I had not seen before."}
{"text":"I have to say my lower rating is based on how much I loved The Library when I first moved back to the 'Burgh... the last few times I have been there were simply not the same.   Not only has the quality in food and service gone down the pooper, but I think they were doing menu changes simply to make more money and it was very evident to the customers.  They were once known for their half price apps later in the evening, well, many of those apps are no longer considered apps.  Anyone with a brain can see why they moved the items.  If you are going to make these types of changes, do it in a better fashion.  That is just my two cents as someone who has always been involved in sales/marketing/promotions.   Even though we live right by here, I do not know if it is a place that I will frequent.  I may give it a shot again some other time but that is it.  If I want to enjoy myself, have good bites and brews with good service, there are plenty of other options!"}
{"text":"Horrible place. Once was great, now a joke. I was served a raw portobello mushroom sandwich for lunch. The service is atrocious."}
{"text":"The Library opened up roughly around the time Harris Grill burned down (that was a sad sad day... I was on the back patio when it happened).   So as an alternative, The Library became our regular place to go.   The library atmosphere is fun and whimsical, the menus are located within the first couple pages of old school books and they used to have their dessert menu as the checkout card located in the front cover sleeve just like back in the day.  The decor is very much like a library, but one in which drinking takes place =)  Menu items contain literary references such as the:  Tyler Durden: Black and Blue Ribeye The Scarlet Letter: Asiago tortellini, spinach, mushrooms, & roasted pepper sauce Arabian Nights: Hummus Plate  While the reference doesn't always hit the mark, you have to give them some creativity and vision points... especially in Pittsburgh.  The food from my experiences is good but not exceptional, but if you can catch the happy hour they have some really decent food at the right price.  We've had quite the time at the Library... birthdays, going away parties, late nights...  As far as Pittsburgh establishments go, The Library is a very decent place to hang out, get your drink on, and nosh on something other than rogies (perogies), wings, and other miscellaneous Barf-ood.  Were I still in da Pitts, you would see me there."}
{"text":"Well, we are officially moving out of the North Oakland/Shadyside area in less than 3 weeks, yay! :D We found a much larger apartment near the South Side Works for the same price so we went to sign our lease Friday! We wanted to celebrate with a drink and it was happy hour, so we headed for the library (it was our first time).   We ate on the patio and shared some half price chicken nachos. Bobby enjoyed a long island (he's been on a long island kick for awhile now lol) and since we were on the porch and it was superr hot that day i just drank water.. even though we went to celebrate.   Our server was friendly and we enjoyed ourselves. Some of the nacho chips were clearly stale but eh- what can you do. The two happy hours are a deal and since we're close by im sure we will be back"}
{"text":"Super awesome place for late night food and drink deals. Also never realized there was an upstairs with another pool table and additional seating. The bartender Luke was really fun. Highly recommend the wings and goat cheese stuffed peppers."}
{"text":"I came here last fall with some friends during the 5-7pm happy hour.  I'm not much into bar-hopping, so generally, the South Side isn't my scene.  However, I really liked the ambience of this place, and the food and drinks were alright.  I ordered the poutine (Lemieux), and its flavor was okay, but the fries were a bit too soggy in places, and it was served cooler than I'd like.  I don't remember much about my drink, to be honest, which means that it was probably a-ok, but not remarkable, as well.  However, the HH prices are pretty awesome!  As a bibliophile, I enjoyed the library-themed decor, which included books, knickknacks, and wood paneling, on the second floor, the view of S. Carson from the windows, and the library-themed menu.  Also, I liked that it was fairly quiet, to the point that I didn't feel like I had to shout over other customers or TVs to make myself heard.  This is a rarity in PGH bars, esp. on the S. Side!  Based on my experience, I'd be willing to come back during HH the next time I'm on the S. Side with some friends."}
{"text":"The Library is one of my favorite spots in the city. While I lived in State College, the average Happy Hour was from 9-11, and coming back to Pittsburgh was somewhat of a letdown for enjoying enough reasonably priced food and beer. Fortunately, that's not a worry at the Library!   They have a happy hour DAILY(Saturday and Sunday included) from 5-7 AND 9-11(and beyond, for the food). Yes, for 28 hours a week you can enjoy $3.25 drafts of any beer 12% ABV and below, and the selection here is usually good if they aren't low on stock. Also, appetizers are half off as well. Sharing with my vegetarian girlfriend, we often find ourselves splitting nachos sans-meat, and they're awesome. Not only is it a huge plate, but they're totally covered in well-distributed toppings. I'm also partial to the mussels appetizer, and the sweet potato fries with a smoked jalepeno aioli(ok, smoked jalepeno mayo) is super tasty as well.  Sadly, when not on Happy Hour this place is fairly pricey for the sort of food they serve, with appetizers and sandwiches for $10+, and entrees ranging from $15-$30. I don't often order off the standard menu, but the salads we've tried have at least been good.  The place is laid out with a bar immediately upon entry with some high-top tables and two TVs over the bar, separated by a wall into a dining area with mostly 4-tops and a muted TV in the corner. Sometimes sitting near the door in the dining area can be pretty chilly.  They used to hand you the menu inside of book covers, but they sadly have not done that for the last few months. The draft list is on a chalkboard as you walk in and in the dining area, but I have never found the servers to be extremely knowledgable about any of the selections. Service is usually quick, and even on Friday and Saturday nights this East Carson spot stays comparatively calm."}
{"text":"Alright, imma break this down. I've been coming here for the last 6 years and I've always had nothing but amazing experiences. There are a million reasons this place has my consistant patronage. Honestly, working in the industry, I'm ashamed I havent written something sooner because they deserve it. I don't go out often in Southside because lets be real, it can be a real shit show. The library has NEVER let me down.  Idk where to start so lets make a list:  #1. nowhere in Southside has a better happy hour. And awesome daily specials.  they do 2 EVERY DAY. Yes, even Saturday and Sunday. Great for game nights/barcrawls (if you're into that kinda thing etc) they have switched it up over the years but currently its half off small plates (the beat breaded wings you can get, nachos, hummus, etc, )  Mondays are dollar tacos, Tuesday's are 3.99 for a half lb of ribs and fries, Wednesday is 1/2 off pizza (I always leave with tons of leftover) etc...did I mention its from an almost all scratch kitchen and great quality?  #2. AMAZING rotating craft beer list that are ALMOST* ALL 4$ ALL DAY EVERY DAY. No HH needed. I'm a beer snob and their owners are so on top of constantly rotating all new and sought after beer. Staff/bartenders are always very knowledgeable helpful about it too. Seriously overlooked on this level as far as I know.   #3. Non smoking bar with pool and darts, both downstairs and upstairs. Did I mention they have an upstairs? Its HUGE. Full bar. Available to rent out for large parties. And In the summertime, ROOFTOP PATIO FOR EVERYBODY HEEEYYYY.    #4. The staff rocks. Every. Single. Employee there has been very lovely to me over so many years. They find the perfect balance of professional and personal. It feels like family. It's like if CHEERS was a real place. Not just me, I see them interact with others. Rick is one of the best bartenders I've ever had and totally the best I've had in the city. Jordan is super lovely too, very bubbly and super super sweet.   I could go on longer, but its better you just check it out yourself. Its wonderful and a small local business so it gets understandably busy and of course it doesnt run in the dull mechanical way some corporate places run but it's better because its personal and full of character. These guys will take care of you. My favorite place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We were here New Year's Eve for dinner and had awful service. Our waitress was MIA for the entire time, but the fries were bomb. If you like $7 draft beers and overpriced mediocre food, The Library is about to be your new favorite hangout."}
{"text":"The Library had high expectations to meet since it was automatically associated with Bourbon & Branch's library in SF. One day I will realize this is Pittsburgh and nothing will compare to home.  The bar was average, with the majority of patrons concentrated in the first room (as that bar was the only open one on a Saturday night there). The rest of the restaurant/area was empty except for a couple tables on the patio. For a place called the library, I expected more books/bookshelves decor - they had a few bunches sitting on deco fireplaces. It was cute that the menus were inside some of the books and the decoupage tables with various comics and news articles were amusing."}
{"text":"Here lies the remains of \"Spirit of St Louis\". I know everyone usually posts pretty plated \"before\" photos, but this is an ode to the delicious veggies in a wonderful sauce on a light crisp tortilla. Didn't use the salsa- poor waste of salsa and I really really wish someone were here to finish off this nutrient powerhouse!!! I had the veggie option. Not sure if the meat variety is the same... Oh and the PRETZELS!!! OMG more like butter rolls! Very yummy beer cheese! And my alibi for wasting that morsel of awesomeness!!! Very good specials... No regular beer on draft. So if that's your thing, sorry. Full bar otherwise"}
{"text":"The library is really two bars. Downstairs, it caters towards what I would call the typical \"high-end\" South Siders. There's a lot of TVs with sports, and a lot of dudes wearing too much cologne, and chicks with crunchy hair. The tenders a tad stingy, particularly with drink-and-mixer cocktails. Upstairs, however, is more boheme. The pool table area has its own small bar, as does a hidden patio. My favorite room is the large dining area upstairs. They typically have great, local art on display (and sale), and on Fridays and Saturdays, the waitstaff is quick and friendly.   A big draw for the Library is the food. Not only is it literary in its name, it's unlike typical bar fare. The sandwiches are stellar. I recommend the George Orwell/Animal Farm sandwich. And the Edgar Allen Potatoes are excellent as well.   All in all, I would rate the upstairs of the Library five stars if you're searching for a low-key, fascinating place to sit and talk. I would rate the downstairs three-stars, as it really is just another SS bar."}
{"text":"I, unfortunately, have to re-rate this place and subtract 2 stars. The all you can eat wings, from what I hear on the twitterz, are more expensive now.  I've gone a handful (...eh...10-15ish) times over the past 2 years, and had the wings every time.  It's really hit and miss.  Sometimes they're amazing, and other times they're soggy and meh.  I hate to say it, but I'm not sure they're my favorite wings in the city anymore, mostly because their quality is so unreliable.  But they still do have great happy hours, and it's somewhat off the beaten South Side path.  You can get parking nearby and they have a spacious upstairs room and/or patio."}
{"text":"Great food. Restaurant quality food and the beer selection is great. The prices are a little higher but that just drives away the rowdy cheap-beer college crowd. It can get busy in there but I've always enjoyed my time there."}
{"text":"Sadly, I feel like every time I come back to this place it gets worse. I have fallen in love with their newer pinnacle drinks, the Sour Patch Kid is amazing! It tastes just like a real Sour Patch Kid. They are also on special at $4 during their happy hours.  However, the past few times I have been here the service has been horrible. The kitchen is super slow, it took about an hour  just to get our app in one of the last visits. Then our food came about 30 min after that. We asked for waters and got them after our bill was on our table. They also seem oddly quick to try to take your plates away when you aren't even finished eating.   During my boyfriend and I's most recent visit we had found out that they changed their fried pickles, and not for the better. The nicely breaded pickle spears have now become some barely breaded, barely fried, pickle chips. I think I've made the same quality fried pickles in my kitchen on the stovetop. Def not worth the money as an app. (we got them as a side to a sandwich)   It seems like this place has continually gone downhill since they changed their menu and made certain things small plates and certain things apps. (during happy hour, \"small plates\" are half off, while \"apps\" are not. it's a super weird way to structure a menu, and the only reason why i can see they changed it was so they could not include certain things in the happy hour special) We were really disappointed when our favorite apps were now not being included as part of the happy hour specials, and it just seems to be getting worse with every visit."}
{"text":"First order of business:  This is not a typical east carson st bar.  You can go here on a Friday or Saturday night, have a great meal, a handful of beers while sitting down and chat with your friends.  Try doing this anywhere else.  Now that's taken care of, this has hands down the best happy hour I have experienced in Pittsburgh.  From 5-7 and 9-11pm drafts are $3.  Small plates are half off from 5-7 and 9pm-1am.  That said, the small plates (8 of 'em) are pretty solid.  Everything from sliders and fries to house made hummus to SCALLOPS and MUSSELS.  The menu goes way beyond that with another 7-8 sandwiches from $8-12 and 6 entrees from $9-25.  The beer selection is solid.  Nothing unseen, but the draft list of 8-10 craft beers is a nice surprise especially at $3!  Bottle list is very extensive.  I will be back, for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Good place to escape the crazy, Mickey Mouse scene that plagues much of the South Side.  More of a later 20s & 30s crowd but not a sleepy place.  Had food one time and it was good, but I can't remember what we had now.  They have multiple levels and there's a pool table on the second floor.  Nothing special on the drinks, but we like to sit at tables and the servers have been attentive."}
{"text":"I like to come during happy hour. They have a good selection of small plates, which are half off during happy hour. I like to get the Three Little Pigs with the fried pickles. It is a perfect amount that doesn't put you over the edge. The Library also has a good beer selection. The draft list changes all the time and it is fun to always have new options to choose from. I tried the Clown Shoes Clementine, which was pretty good. Overall, I really enjoy coming to the library. The outside patio upstairs is awesome when this Pittsburgh weather cooperates!"}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for this place.  I was drawn in by the theme and the reviews here. I must admit, the theme is pretty cool. I feel they could have pushed it further somehow, but I don't have any particular suggestions. I really enjoy the cut out book menus--I just wish they sat on the table with you so you could read them when you're through ordering!  We may have gone in on an off day, but the food was just ok. My boyfriend ordered the aztec chicken soup as a starter, which our server forgot and brought out after our meal got to the table. He reports that the soup was \"ok.\" He also got The Tempest burger, which was good but fairly standard. The french fries that came with were bland. I forget the name of my sandwich, but it was a turkey club with a fried egg on top--good! I ordered the sweet potato fries on the side and they were served burnt. We both got sodas and they were weak--the syrup needed to be replaced in the fountain. We told our server, but instead of fixing the soda fountain she simply offered a different soda. (I'm pretty sure she was new to restaurant work. We were one of 3 table in the place on a Tuesday afternoon and everything seemed to take her forever to do.)   Since neither of us ordered an entree or drink, I may give it another try down the road. The service and food from my first visit left me unimpressed."}
{"text":"It's \"i eat\" I guess.   Food is nothing to WRITE HOME ABOUT LOLLLL BOOK PUNS!!!!!  That being said, maybe it's just the stuff on the appetizer menu cuz like I had a well made salad for lunch this one time u no??  Service is fine.  They have some aiiiight beers on tap.  Definitely above average for pub food but so good that makes me want to...RE-READ IT????"}
{"text":"Spent $50+ to have the bartender RUIN our night and threaten to call the police.  I will NEVER go here again.  We had spent over $50 and had the bartender threaten to call the police if we did not leave, simply because we were sitting at the bar while a buddy was sipping water to sober up.   He was leaning up against the bar watching the tv, when the bartender snapped at him (no she did not ask if he was ok, or ask nicely) that \"he has to sit up or you have to go\". I told him he had to sit up to drink his water, and he did so without argument. Not even 5min later after he was sitting there, quietly watching the football game while sipping his water she told us that we have to leave, and forced us to wait outside for our uber to show up in the cold. When we asked why we had to leave, she said that she's the manager and can do what she wants, and if we didn't leave she would call the police.   This is the absolute WORST treatment I've ever received at any bar I've ever been to. We were being responsible, making sure we sobered up our friend before leaving and they kicked us out. Had something bad happened to him, they could have been held responsible and sued. Absolutely disgraceful.  I recommend taking your business elsewhere, where the bartender will actually make sure to take care of it's patrons."}
{"text":"This place has slowly started to go downhill since I've first been there.  The atmosphere is unique, but once it gets crowded, the acoustics make it difficult to hear your conversation.  The waitstaff is hit or miss.  It's either been great and friendly or unbelievably shitty.  The menu changes rarely and the food seems to get greasier.  Avoid the burger sliders on the appetizer menu unless you enjoy raw meat."}
{"text":"Great honey Cajun wings and sweet potato fries!!!!"}
{"text":"I really am surprised that there aren't more 4 star reviews! I frequent here for both the food and for the drinks.  Hosts and hostesses have consistently been very friendly and quick to seat us.  Occasionally service is a little slow, thus why I've given 4 stars instead of 5.    The vibe is casual, and I rarely see too many drunken idiots there which is something I definitely prefer, especially if I choose to go out on the weekend.  I've sat both downstairs and upstairs at tables and the bar; no complaints on the seating.  Another thing I love is that it's accommodating to larger parties.  The beer list is outstanding and there's definitely something to drink for everybody.  Prices are reasonable and I'm always given a glass for my bottled Franziskaner.  Servers and bartenders are always knowledgeable on the different brews they have and happy hour specials.  As for my favorite part, the food! You'll notice from my other reviews that I'm a pretty picky eater and get the same meal at every restaurant.  Nachos are a staple anywhere I go, and this is no exception! I'm usually a pain in the a** and take off everything except for chicken, cheese, and jalapenos.  For my main meal, here it's The Fairest Fowl.  Tasty chicken in cajun seasoned panko, \"pan fried and drizzled with our jerk sauce\". This comes with potatoes and veggie of the day which always tastes fresh.  This  is probably one of my favorite meals, ever.  If you go through the photos on here you'll be sure to find mine.  Again, another great restaurant in Pittsburgh's South Side!"}
{"text":"Though my husband loves Library and comes here every Tuesday night, I have actually only been here four times - twice for work happy hours and twice with friends. Three out of four of my experiences were excellent, but sadly, my last visit here was a tad disappointing.  I came here just a couple weeks ago for a work happy hour, and the entire top floor was reserved for my office's event. All drinks were paid for by my workplace, and over fifty people had attended. However, only one bartender was working, so over 20 people were in line at one time. Someone jokingly said to me that as soon as he got his drink that he was going to get back in line because it was so long. Considering the amount of money that my workplace had spent on this event, I think it was absolutely terrible service to only have one bartender upstairs.  After waiting in a 10+ minute line for a drink, I requested a drink that was on a tap handle -- Full Pint White Lightning. Well, apparently, they did not have White Lightning on tap but another Full Pint IPA beer. I'm sorry, but if you don't have the correct branded handle, then just use some sort of generic handle. It's confusing to the customer.  The reason that I'm still giving The Library four stars after a frustrating experience there is (a) my other three experiences were great and (b) they have such delicious food. The hummus served with their Arabian Nights small plate is exceptional. I've also had their Slaughter House mini pulled pork sandwiches which were delicious and surprisingly filling for their petite size. Their pizzas are very tasty, and I've had the opportunity to try several types. However, my two favorite things - the Frida Kahlo, nachos served with your typical beans/sour cream/etc plus pulled pork, and the Magic Pretzel, which tastes more like delicious breadsticks served with beer cheese - will absolutely blow your mind with how delicious they are.  Overall, I really enjoy the Library and am actually craving a Magic Pretzel right now...."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the wings are awesome...just don't order the fried pickles. What you get is about half a cup of batter, half a cup of oil and pickles sliced so thin that they barely make it through the cooking process without disintegrating. Ate about three and I was done. Worst part was I mentioned it to the bartender and he just smiled and went \"yeah....\" No offer of taking them off the tab or a beer on the house... Just a smile and a \"yeah....\"  Update (next day): so pissed about the experience that I dropped my rating to one star and decided I'll never go there again. That's all."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with The Library but there isn't anything great either. The food is ok and the beer list is decent. They changed there menu over the years to primarily be sandwiches and pizza. However, all the food pretty much has been on the menu for over a decade. They could benefit from an update. Most recently, I went there and ordered a chicken quesadilla. There was nothing in the tortilla but chicken and cheese. I had to ask for salsa. It was pretty sad. There really isn't too much more to say outside of the mediocrity."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, there was a bridal shower at The Library. And it was an amazing experience!  I hosted my sister's Bridal Shower there and everything was spectacular, albeit getting ahold of the events staff originally wasn't the quickest process. From the first conversation however, the staff answered all of my questions and helped me to create a custom menu, including working within my budget and helping me figure out the right amount of food while allowing me to include mimosas within that price range.  What really sold me on choosing The Library was the space! For our private event we had the entire 2nd floor -- a private bar, upstairs restaurant area with seating, pool table, and outdoor space. There was a ton of room for everyone to roam around and enjoy the space. It was great to have enough space to decorate as well as hold the in one space while everyone chit chatted and played games in another.  The day was such a hit, especially with the awesome food. It was a variety of things from appetizers to wraps and tacos. Having a variety of foods types PLUS a mimosa bar really made the day a big hit.  Thanks again to the awesome staff for making my sister's shower a dream come true!"}
{"text":"The library is my new favorite bar-food-for-dinner spot on the South Side. They have delicious apps such as the sweet potato fries with jalapeno aioli dip. Plus, they have a good selection of draft beers and wines to choose from, a smashing happy hour, and a low-key atmosphere. It's easy to let the night slip away here while drinking at a table near the bar.   Unfortunately, I've only been here during the winter, but I hear that their deck is stupendous, and I look forward to enjoying it next summer.  It's not often on the South Side that you find good food that you don't have to dress to the 9s for, so the Library is a welcome addition."}
{"text":"The Library was once one of my go-to places...especially for their happy hours. The half-off appetizers (from 5pm-7pm & 9pm-1am) and $3 drafts (5pm-7pm & 9pm-11pm) were unbeatable. The apps were delicious, and they usually had a solid selection of beers on tap. Unfortunately, upon my last visit, we found that they had changed the menu around, removing a lot of our favorite \"appetizers\" to a \"sides\" menu, negating their \"special\" status. The new convoluted menu (well, convoluted to regulars) was incredibly frustrating, and while the beer deals continued on, it turns out the annoyance with this simple menu change proved that it was the food specials that really kept us going back. I was never a huge fan of their sandwiches or meals, but the apps were excellent...well before the special pricing, so that seemingly small change in the menu actually seemed bigger to us.  Overall, for someone who's been going there since day one - or more realistically, the first week or two that it opened - I've seen the food go from AWESOME to so-so. The first chef there was excellent and he laid the groundwork for a solid, simple menu. After he left, things like the quality of the sweet potato fries went down hill, as they'd come out too soggy to really enjoy, and the chicken tenders were often overcooked. When it first opened they also had a Guinness dipping sauce that was amazing, but that, too, went by the wayside.  While change is a constant in the restaurant industry, some changes are going to turn certain people away. For a place that I used to frequent once or twice a week to become an afterthought can sometimes come down to a person's change of taste. Unfortunately, in my case, it's a case of change of menu and quality.  Regardless, The Library usually has a good tap selection, and the food there is decent. It's just not as good as it once was."}
{"text":"Some of my friends really like The Library. I think it is alright, but I'm still a little confused about what all they hype is about. NOTE: I have never been here for the food so take this review as a commentary on the bar scene part of it.  What the Library does have going for it is a top notch draft beer selection and a great happy hour where you can get any draft for something like 3 dollars. The happy hour vibe is really good, not too crowded. The bartenders are also knowledgeable about the beers they sell.  I don't really like The Library post happy hour. It starts getting really packed and the vibe is kind of confusing. The Library just doesn't seem like place where everyone is packed in. It sometimes feels like that scene in Star Wars where they are getting crushed in the garbage compactor on the Death Star.  The music choices often leave a lot to be desired.  To sum it up, the Library shines around happy hour times, otherwise it is just like any other South Side bar."}
{"text":"This is a really great bar to stop into while exploring the South Side of Pittsburgh. Established and reputable, The Library is a very nice bar. The downstairs is generally busy; however, it's possible to get some peace and quiet if you head upstairs where they have another bar and even more rotating craft beers.   The craft beer selection is good and generally has good, reliable beers to try. When the draft isn't to your liking, check out the bottle selection.   Can't attest to the food as I haven't yet tried it.   One other thing to note was the fact that on my way out, the owner of the place ran downstairs to check his stock of beers that he keeps for himself and friends. Among them he found a 2010 Founders Breakfast Stout that he offered to me just because we had a good conversation about beer. He's a very generous guy and obviously cares for his customers and retains a passion for good craft beer. I'd recommend a place with such an owner to anyone. Be sure to check it out."}
{"text":"back in the day this place  was nice and  was crowded  today nothing special  personal don't care about customer"}
{"text":"I had gone here with a friend for lunch on a Sunday. The service was not very good. The bar/restaurant was not busy at all, so I'm not sure what was going on with that. I will have to give them credit for the food though. I had the Oedipus Rex pizza. It was perfect! My friend had the Helen of Troy salad. The salad was big and she said it was tasty. I would love to give this place a 4 or 5 star, but the service was far from that. The prices were not bad and they have some really good specials. I would recommend checking their website out to see the menu option, hours and specials."}
{"text":"Finally I got to come here and no regrets. No regrets at all.  We went on Trivia night and failed miserably... The half off bottle of wine really helped ease the pain of losing and not only that but the all you can eat wings really hit the spot.   Not only was the wine half off but the waiter gave us half off because the wings were going to take longer than expected. The service truly catered to the customers and not a lot of businesses go above and beyond."}
{"text":"I was last here during their  9-11pm happy hour on a weekday night. Nearly all of their drafts are $3,pinnacle drinks are $3, and all small plates are half off until 1am. My dining partner and I shared \"The three little pigs\" and \"the magic pretzel\". The three little pigs were 3 pork sliders (normally priced at $12-half off from 9-1am) and we added the fried pickles, which absolutely enhanced the flavor of the BBQ sauce and pork. I even made the comment that I was surprised that a restaurant not specializing in BBQ would have pork that was so tender and flavorful. \"The magic pretzel\" ($4 during the happy hour) consisted of 3 long soft pretzels served with homemade beer cheese. The pretzels were obviously just that,pretzels, but the beer cheese was absolutely delicious! In all we ordered 4 beers and these small plates and our bill came to $25. We will for sure be back to partake in additional small plates during the happy hour but after reviewing their menu we may need to revisit for a regular lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This bar has the coolest theme!  The whole place does indeed look like a library - not one where you borrow books, but more like a library/study in somebody's old house.  I went with four friends on a Monday night, and we easily got a table outside on their upstairs patio.  It was great to sit outside on a summer evening.  You don't get a great view from up there - it has high walls so you can't even see much of the sky - but it's still a way to get some air and escape the noise of the street.  The menus are taped inside the first few pages of giant coffee table books, so all of our menus had a different theme!  One of my friends actually got quite involved reading his book and didn't want the server to take it away.  It's really a nice, clever touch.  We arrived early enough to catch the end of happy hour for $3 draft beers - they had a nice, creative selection.    We started with the Billy Goats Gruff - poblano peppers stuffed with goat cheese and chipotle cream sauce.  And wow, were they spicy!  We really enjoyed the creaminess, but they do have a kick so watch out!  We also got The Tale of Ginger and Pickles - fried pickles, essentially, which were okay but a bit sour for my taste.  I got some pizza, and it was a great price for way more pizza than I could eat.  Crust was very thin and not very crispy - it didn't have a really amazing flavor, but it was a decent meal and reheated nicely.  I'd come back for drinks on the patio - for sure!  It feels like a refuge from the other places on Carson...."}
{"text":"Awesome seating arrangements, luxurious bar. The place to go when your folks ask how studying's going. Try their pizzas, burgers, and especially their fries! The drinks are reasonably priced as well, so go crazy!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. One of the only restaurants with a kitchen open late, and delicious food. The half-off small plates happy hour makes it very affordable too. All the book references are an added bonus. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! 1/2 off appetizers! The hummus platter is generous and delicious, I recommend it for snacking while enjoying a drink on their great rooftop patio. Love the patio on summer nights with the cool string lights, it's a nice chill atmosphere. There are a lot of \"books\" and crannies in this place: a small bar area (large bar), big indoor dining area, little sidewalk \"al fresco\" seating where you can people watch, HUGE upstairs and the rooftop. The idea of this place is awesome, menus placed inside of old books adds entertainment and a creative touch! Friendly service, good crowd, decent wine list, lengthy beer list and cool, creative plate names makes The Library a win in MY book :)"}
{"text":"The manager was extremely disrespectful.  Unless you are a local white resident pittsburgh native you will not be accepted."}
{"text":"Our friend had a little too much to drink and was having some water to sober up and we were watching football. He got a little sleepy and his head hit the bar for a second and we were all kicked out and had to wait for Uber in the cold outside. I'm in my fifties so he was not causing trouble. There was no warning and she said \"I'm the manager and it's my call.\"  If he was driving and got in an accident they could have been sued. And she threatened to call the police??  DO NOT GO HERE! There are many more customer friendly bars in Southside."}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived about 6:15 on Saturday evening. Parking is always a challenge, but we persevered and succeeded in finding a spot within 2 blocks. Walked in and were pleasantly greeted and immediately seated at a smalltable by a window.  Menus are inside books and use names found in a place of study. The friendly and helpful waitress guided us for appetizers and our main courses. She suggested the black bean humus; okay, it was plentiful and delicious, great choice. I ordered the crusted tilapia which turned out wonderful tasting. The charred asparagus was super and tender and matched well with the garlic mashed potatoes.  When we left at 7:30,the place was getting noisier,but not objectionable. We are fans and will be back."}
{"text":"If you need to get to a good, affordable wine night, come to The Library on Monday or Tuesday or you know why not both, red wine is good for the heart, I've heard that somewhere.   With bottles being affordable to begin with, half off makes them an excellent deal and even better from 5-7pm and 9pm-1am they have half off small plates.   Personally my favorite are the pretzels with beer cheese but the pepperoni rolls come in as a close second."}
{"text":"My friends and I love The Library.  Not the most amazing atmosphere, but it's a chill bar with a good crowd and solid food.    Happy hour food specials are bomb - I always try to go for these.  I've had almost all of the apps/small plates and none have disappointed.  They've also got great wing specials and the wings themselves are delicious.    Sandwiches, salads and burgers are good, but because the special is unbeatable I usually stick with that.    A plus: the crowd tends to be more mature than some of the other southside staples. If you're looking for a consistent, low key good time in the southside, go here!"}
{"text":"The Library is my favorite South Side bar for 3 reasons.  1. Atmosphere. I love the decor. The downtown is nice, has a bar on one side & dining on the other side. Upstairs is a nice hang out place. Pool Table, Bar, Dining area, couches & of course books. There is also an outdoor patio with is delightful. I've sat up there during the day & at night. Both times its beautiful up there. You really don't feel like you are on the south side. This place is perfect for group happy hours, dinner with friends, dates, or just for drinks during a bar crawl.   2. Food & Drink selection. I'm always impressed with their food. I've had/or tasted quite a few things on there menu. They always find creative ways to make things in accordance with the 'library' theme. Also, being a vegetarian there are plenty of options for me. My usuals are Alice in Wonderland burger. It's a portabello mushroom burger with a delicious mayo sauce on it. Another favorite is the Edgar Allen Poe Fries! Which are sweet potato fries. The best I've had in this city! My third favorite is the Arabian Nights which is a platter of hummus & black bean hummus which veggies & pitas for dipping. It is so good & filling.  3. The Happy Hour. Not only is there 1....there are 2! You can not beat that. Its usually hard to find a happy hour in this city that goes until 7. The library Happy hour is from 5-7 & 9-11. Are you kidding me? That's great. From 5-7 you can enjoy appetizers or they may call it \"small plates' for HALF OFF from 5-7 & all there amazing selection of brews are $3.35. They are good beers too...you won't find coors light here. So I usually go there get Arabian Nights, Edgar Allen Poe Fries, a brew.....& it's under $10! Amazing. Also, if you going there with a group & end up having a few more at $3.25....it's still cheaper then going to any other bar. Also if you end up staying long enough happy hour will renew again in 2 hours. Which I have done before. There is a pool table & outdoor patio. It's overall a great time I highly recommend going there. it's also a great place to take out of town guests!"}
{"text":"What a find! Came across this place looking for anything that would serve any food after 11 pm on a Friday. Called at least 10 other places (bars included) in the city and struck out everywhere. I'm from the DC suburbs and we have honest to goodness restaurants (I don't just mean fast food like Taco Bell) out here that stay open til 2 am or 24 hours all week long, let alone serve full menus on Fridays and Saturdays for sure.   It was a shock to my system to be in a \"city\" and I couldn't find even half menus/late night food served after 11 pm on a FRIDAY? So I went into this experience with a low bar of 'please just serve me food.' Well, I was more than blown away!  Not only were they still serving what seemed like a full menu, but it was really, really good! I can't wait to come back and try more. Got 2 pizzas, and they were creative and generous in portions of the more expensive toppings! (The goat cheese and bbq pizzas, i can't recall the names but everything has a fun literature themed name). And it may sound funny to care but their french fries were the absolute perfect balance of crispy but chewy! Bonus fun was that they had a late night happy hour? It was like half price on beers at the time of night I would expect most bars to be making a large part of their profit, so that was brilliant too.   Not a ton of seating, but there is a pool table and a dart machine that both seemed well maintained despite obvious frequent use. Bar seating around too. Dim lighting, but appeared clean. Need ID (be 21) to enter after 11pm at least. Bar atmosphere, clear gathering place for 20-30 somethings? Had a good time. Would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to have lunch and I can't really say anything except that it was \"okay\". There's a lot to choose from and almost anything can be made vegetarian but I wasn't blown away. Good list of beers though. There's also a really nice rooftop patio that I'm sure is really enjoyable when the sun isn't beating down."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend to get a bite to eat before the Penguin's game and it was a great casual place to come.  We specifically stopped in to get the happy hour deals! There was a large selection of beers on tap including craft beers, and the bartender told us that they are $4 all day/every day which seemed like a great deal to me!  From 5-7 everyday (INCLUDING WEEKENDS) The Library has half off small plates!  Here's what we got...  Napoleon Dynamite - A quesadilla in our case with chicken, mozzarella, cheddar and drizzled with spicy sour cream.  It didn't blow me away, but for the price it was pretty good.  I also recommend asking for a side of ranch to dip it in...more calories, but also more delicious!  The Pickle King - Fried pickle chips that came with ranch to dip.  They had a pretty thin layer of breading but were good in my book!  Peter Pan - Fried cheese served with marinara sauce. I mean fried cheese is always amazing, right? I liked that there was more cheese than breading, because they were wedges.  I would definitely stop back here for drinks and happy hour again!"}
{"text":"I almost want to rate this place a 5 stars, but I was only here once, so take it with a grain of salt.   Walking around on Saturday night at 9p on Carson, the atmosphere on the street was college-aged and boisterious, like West 6th in Cleveland. I saw 2 bachelorette parties on Carson. I was looking for something less of a dive bar or dance club and more of a lounge. The library filled that niche for me.  It was a great place. There were about a dozen beers on draft, nearly all micro brews [including Victory, Lake Erie Monster from Great Lakes]. The best part: all draft beers [except ones above 12% ABV] were $3 from 5-7 PM and 9-11 PM. EVERYDAY. I was shocked. I eagerly had a Victory wit and an Irish stout for $6.   The service from Stephanie the bartender and the barback was great. Even on a Saturday night, with all but 1 bar seat filled, Our drink orders were served promptly and they were friendly. 90s music like better than ezra, gin blossoms, and the rest of the vh1 crew filled the air. There was noise, but still quiet enough to have a normal conversation with the person next to you at the bar.  I had the Scallops appetizer ( 1/2 off all appetizers every day from 5-7 P and 9p to 1A - wow). For $5, a damn steal. 6 Scallops, cooked perfectly for me [soft, moist] on small pieces of bread. Plus, the cups of pesto and a tomato sauce on the side. The pesto was a bit salty for me, but the tomato sauce was amazing.   Based on my only visit, I would probably be a regular if I lived in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun at The Library tonight. Good drinks, great food specials, cool staff and some games to play. You can't go wrong with 2 different happy hours. Both the pizza and appetizers were 1/2 off on Wednesdays during happy hour. We played pool, darts, had a couple drinks and a pizza. Between the 3 of us, no ones bill was more than $13. Very happy and will be back next time we visit."}
{"text":"Location-wise, this place was easy enough to find, it is on the main road just right of the Birmingham bridge when you enter Southside.  Don't let the name deceive you, think of this place as a hybrid between a library and a bar OR a library with a bar. That's what it felt like. The library vibe it had was segregated to one side and to the other side, it was like a regular bar, radiated with the color of sports from its flat-screen TVs.  The restaurant area was more library themed. It was adorned with bookshelves, ONE old-fashioned green library desk lamp that I saw on someone's table, books with menus pasted on its front few pages, and the tabletops showing some pictures of history. The restaurant also cleverly labeled the menu and cocktail items off more easily recognizable book titles. That was pretty cool.  We came here on a wintry Friday night for their happy hour from 9pm - 1am, which gives us $3 drafts and 1/2 Off All Appetizers! Surprisingly, there was no wait as we walked in a few minutes after 9pm. The bouncer was also nice enough to allow one person who was underage in our party to just join us and eat but not share in the merry joys of the drink. Seeing as how we came here for happy hour, we purely ordered off the happy hour menu and the drafts menu was ample enough with choices we didn't have to look anywhere else even though happy hour also takes $1 off the regular cocktails.  Here's what we ordered and liked / disliked: Billy Goat's Gruff - Two roasted peppers that were roasted to the extent of it being burnt and for our party, we didn't like how the cheese mixed with the spicy chipotle sauce. We left the place with one still remaining on the plate.  Dark Green, Bright Red - Definitely a must try on the menu if you like scallops. They give you around 6-7 scallops that are full of flavor that the addition of pesto can be made optional.  Slaughter House Four - Your basic sliders, but just a tip, when the waitress asks if you want to add onions, bacon, etc onto it, they all come at an extra cost.  Edgar Allen Potatoes / Sweet Potatoes - The fries do not come with truffle aioli anymore and when these were served to us, they were soft, soggy and cold. How do you mess up fries that badly?!?!  The Tale of Ginger and Pickles - If you like pickles, you should try them fried. Unfortunately they fry a whole slice of pickle rather than in individual bite-size versions."}
{"text":"While visiting Pittsburgh, my good friend and I stopped at the Library and ( eventually ) got the nachos (can't really remember the official name of the order). The nachos were really good, don't get me wrong, but where I was EXTREMELY pleased with my service was with the bartender (maybe waitress too). She said her name was Jordan, idk really know the spelling, maybe Jordy? Small girl with long brown hair. Anyway, she was incredible. She was very patient as we tried to figure out what we wanted. She was super helpful and offered suggestions as to what we should get. After dinner we went up to the bar and met an employee by the name of Rick. Super nice guy who was helpful with what we wanted. Just wanted to make sure I thanked Rick and Jordyn for their incredible and professional service ! I will def come to the LIBRARY again !"}
{"text":"Half price apps you really cannot beat that!  I ordered the Billy goat gruff. It wasn't exactly what I expected of a goat cheese dish, but it was tastey none the less.  My friend said the slaw was amazing. Our waitress was a little slow and side condiments for the dishes were forgotten but overall good place to eat"}
{"text":"I came here for wing night, and I absolutely fell in love.  The fact that my cousins and I sat out on the back patio for about 3 hours and we were never hurried out made me feel like I was a returning regular.  I successfully tried all of the wing sauces, and they were all pretty banging.  You have got to try the Honey Cajun; it is miraculous (and I do not think I have ever used that word to describe food).   Our waitress was also extremely kind and she even stood and talked to us for a while in between wing runs.  Over 40 wings and 3 liter pitchers later of Diet Pepsi, I was deliciously satisfied, and I cannot wait to come back to this place.  I LOVE THE SOUTH SIDE!"}
{"text":"I only come during their happy hour and it's always great and inexpensive, $3 drafts and half off small plates 5-7, 9-1. I love their changing beer selection and have tried almost all the small plates, which are delicious. They have this cozy back patio that I love to sit at during the summer."}
{"text":"I was confused when, during a phone conversation about dinner plans, my friend suggested going to \"the library\" to eat--it took me a minute to realize she meant THE Library in the South Side.  As a book lover, I have to agree with the other reviewers who want to see a stronger book theme in the decor of the place.  Yes, the menu taped into hardcover books, the green lamps, and the decoupage table tops are cool.  I was sad that our server took our menus away after we ordered--I wanted to read the Babar the Elephant storybook that was one friend's menu.    I had the Alice in Wonderland sandwich, which was a portobello mushroom sandwich with roasted red peppers and Boursin cheese.  Since it was a blustery night, I was very happy that it was a warm sandwich, not a cold one, and a delicious one at that.  I do wish that the slices of bread were larger, though, because every time I bit into the sandwich, the cheese would ooze out the sides and onto the plate.  As my side, I ordered sweet potato fries, which were all right but not as crispy as I like them.  The smoked jalapeno aioli that came with the fries, however, was fantastic.    The food isn't that imaginative as the literary names of the dishes might suggest, but it's solidly executed.  The draft specials during happy hour (5-7 pm, I think) are a good deal, and the noise level during this time is still conducive to conversations with friends.  Service seemed to be on the slow side, but it did seem like we came in at the very beginning of the Friday night hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"As a teacher you would think I would love this place and it was nice that the food was named after books. But the place was Full I mean full of hipsters. Plus we had to sit upstairs  and I didn't really like that. The food was okay, nothing to die over."}
{"text":"The bartender gave samples of different beers and since as a patron we were very talkative he gave us samples of bloody marries that were specially made in house. Great place to go!!"}
{"text":"This is one of, if not THE, favorite spots of mine for happy hour.  I think I've paid full price here twice, at most.  Not because it isn't good, but $3 drafts/Pinnacle bombs and half off small plates spoiled me for the full menu.  Their hummus plate is huge and very satisfying, but also light.  The chicken tenders, pork sliders, and sweet potato fries are also delicious.  That said, the Animal Farm is my favorite sandwich hands down.    I think it's cool that all of the dishes are named after something literary - chicken wings are Wings of Icarus, pork sliders are Three Little Pigs, etc.  It's also a theme on the drink menu.  The James and the Giant Peach (peach long island iced tea) is so good, but I just discovered the Peach Ring; it tastes exactly like a peach gummy and I know, that isn't a fancy book-ish name.  In the summer, they have a porch on the second level in the back and it's perfect.  It feels like you're sitting on your porch at home because instead of seeing the debauchery happening on Carson Street, you get to see the neighbors - it really solidifies that neighborhood bar thing.  Only downfall is that the service suffers slightly when it's busy.  I was standing at the bar for a good five minutes before someone even acknowledged that they'd be with me soon.  However, I've had a hard time flagging down a server (who all wear short skirts and big glasses - nerdy, get it?) when it was a random week day afternoon as well.  So that could use some attention.  Otherwise, a great spot."}
{"text":"I came here on a (terrible) date a few weeks ago. I love how it looks, the atmosphere and the general idea behind the restaurant and bar area. I loved the selection of yummy beers too. I also loved that there are two happy hours with fairly affordable beers. You can't go wrong there!   I ordered a portobella burger, and it was pretty lackluster. It left a lot to be desired. The waitress was mostly absent and took my beer away before I finished it. I don't drink to get drunk, so I was chasing beer with water. She didn't refill my water once.   It was fairly loud, but that's to be expected. I was mildly entertained by the antics of other people there. It was a Tuesday night, but it felt like a Friday or Saturday.   As a vegan, there's really not much for me to eat here. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. I enjoyed the beers though, so that's why this place is getting 3 solid stars. Service, vegan options and pricing were seriously off target though.   I might return if friends were going for drinks, but I don't see myself being motivated to come back."}
{"text":"Went tonight for Happy Hour appetizers after work. Half price apps and 3 dollar drafts every night of the week? YES PLEASEEEE. Good food that fits with my budget. I ordered the Where the wild things are with their buffalo ranch sauce which I think is wonderful. The boyfriend ordered wings and we split the 3 sliders. The other member of our party ordered wings and the hummus and black bean dips. They also had Dogfish Head Punkin on tap which is a BIG plus!  Our waiter seemed a little aloof and my water was empty until I finally asked for some more water while he was bringing the check. Good thing the boy had some water so I could enjoy my buffalo ranch sauce. He was working a party of 10 as well as a few other tables so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.   The chicken was wonderfully, about 5 or 6 big nuggets, I was expecting but so happy not to see the standard TGIFridays chicken tenders. They had a nice spicy breading on them. The wings were good as usual. I tried the BBQ but I naturally love the Buffalo Ranch as well.   The Hummus/ Black bean dips were fabulous and it was a huge portion! I honestly was expecting half of what we were given. Served with pita and veggies I'll order that again!   It seems like they've changed the appetizer menu, and I was a little disappointed in the selection. I missed the scallops and the pepperoni roll. Maybe they change this menu often I'm not sure, it was only my second time there. But, I do hope that if they revise it anytime soon they add a few more options on there.   I feel like this is the best Happy Hour (definitely food wise) that I've found in the south side. Now that I'm working there I think this will become a regular spot..  Also, mid way through driving I suddenly got really loopy. Having not drank anything I was curious. Maybe there was vodka in my water? Maybe that herby stuff on my chicken was something else? What ever it was I was confused. But I liked it."}
{"text":"Three words: Quiet Bar Pittsburgh  Not easily found... this review is not for the food or this place on a busy night.   But on a week night (yea sorry I am not a frequenter so when I do pop in here its with friends on a weeknight or for a date).   This place is quiet with a decent beer menu, as well as wine mixed drink menu. The serves were friendly and attentive. If watching the big game isn't your thing there is space to sit and chat upstairs. There is lots of space here, the upstairs is a bit cold is my only complaint. But the space is nice and no thumping music so that you cannot hear the party next to you in conversation."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best happy hours in South Side! Can't beat half off apps and $3 draft specials, not only during the normal happy hours (5-7), but also later in the night (9-12). The Library boasts a warm and sophisticated ambiance, especially compared to many of the neighboring bars. More importantly it has an amazing upstairs patio, hidden in the back and away from the noise of Carson. Food is pretty standard bar food - burgers, wraps, wings, pizza, with some entrée selections - but they have something to please everyone and I'm a fan of any place that lets you sub a side salad for fries for free! Ambiance + patio + deals = 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food is decent, and the drinks are ok. Not a hugh selection, but not bad either. The staff can be a little salty though."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday, my girlfriend ordered a blue moon draft. After taking a sip of the beer ahe noticed a dead fly in it. We told the waiter and he quickly got her another beer. Nothing was comped on the bill which i find pretty absurd...."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Thursday night around 10pm and stumbled upon the late night happy hour (half off drafts and half off small plates). It was somewhat busy but not packed when we came in. I had McKenzie's hard cider and it was delicious - tasted exactly like apple juice. Since it was on the draft list, it was only $3.50 for happy hour. My friend ordered the mango margarita ($8) and said it was the best margarita she ever had, but had very low alcohol content. Would stop by again to try other drafts & food!"}
{"text":"Just had drinks there...so the quick and dirty.  Atmosphere -  typical midpoint Southside bar...could be Fat Heads, Blue Lou's...they all run together.  This tells you that their theme is not strongly presented...  Price - Ok. A liitle more than the dive bars but it is nicer inside.   Overall - A nice clean place to met and talk to old friends, which is what I did.   Oh, at first I thought it was called Library for an area of Pittsburgh. Did not get the book reference until today... Hahaha."}
{"text":"Well.......      I agree with other reviewers that their happy hour is pretty good.   I got a sour patch drink that was very large and good.   Now, our app was average pulled pork sliders.      For dinner I got the chicken with jerk sauce.   I was disappointed that I wasn't permitted to switch the starch and was stuck with sun dried tomato risotto (they also wouldn't allow me switch a topping on a burger).....    the risotto could use some seasoning and was just there.... my chicken was very overcooked and dry.   The sauce was awesome and green beans were good.    My husband got a burger that was very good and he was happy with his food.  Our server was slow initially because she had friends at another table (they were served 10 minutes before us).....   she tried to be attentive when they left.  The decor is neat.   I like the concept.... chairs upstairs were uncomfortable particularly for a larger person.  All in all it is OK and we probably will try out again.... it is just a bummer they aren't good with substitutions.... it isn't a high class French restaurant......"}
{"text":"I really love the idea of this place (menus taped inside books, book titles for menu items, green lamps, etc.)! The menu isn't really big (just salads, sandwiches, and pizza) but everything is good and the desserts are good, too!"}
{"text":"The bald bartender is the worst I've ever seen. Clearly he got the job because he knows someone."}
{"text":"Great service!  Decided on The Library for happy hour with friends. The atmosphere was chill and relaxed but the food was fresh and on point. I had the chicken nachos to start which were loaded with fresh cheese, olives, chicken. Not only are they awesome but they were half off. I also shared the garlic parmesan wings which were fantastic. Super churchy and well seasoned. I'll def be back!!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my all time favorite Carson Street eateries. It's actually in the old library building, very quaint.   I love the menus, they actually hand you a book (my book was Of Mice and Men, my date got the Wizard of Oz) with the menus affixed to the covers. All the small plates, entrees, and sandwiches are titled after classic books. Lord of the Rings, (onion rings) Arabian Nights, (hummus) Peter Pan, (cheese sticks?) and many more. I ordered the plabano pepper stuffed with goat cheese and covered with a creamy chipotle sauce, called Billy Goats Gruff. It was crunchy, creamy and delicious. My date ordered Wings of Icarus, yep, wings done with a dry rub.   For lunch I had the Alice in Wonderland, a meaty, marinated, then grilled portobello mushroom with Boursin cheese on ciabatta and sweet fries. The portobello took on the texture of a nice piece of tenderloin. Any meat lover would enjoy this and not miss it. The fries were yam fries, crunchy and delicious. My date got adventurous and ordered The Women in White, creamy risotto with mushrooms, which looked fab! This was my fourth visit here, I highly recommend the Library for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Would I come back again? Probably not. Was the food horrible? No, but it wasn't great. We got wings which were fried and okay, nothing special. The ranch and barbecue were very runny. My sandwich was soggy and the turkey was just lunch meat which was disappointing. When we asked if the veggies were microwaved the waitress said no but she said they were basically cooked in a foot of butter which was gross because we had thought that was sauce. Beer was good and the service was good. Would probably not come back though. Restrooms look like there was a party in there, everything is filthy and most things in there were broken including the toilet seat, a door, and the soap dispenser. Also - we were not carded and got alcohol"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and a great list of beers! The upstairs is nice and quiet."}
{"text":"Library has one of the best evening beer happy hours in the city.  There I said it.  If you know of a better one, please tell me!  Late night specials are 9pm-1am - half priced small plates, and from 9pm-11pm $3.25 drafts.    The small plates aren't your typical TGI Friday apps.  The small plate pricing is inflated, so it's really only a good deal to order them during HH special.  Entrees run from $18-$30 and are overpriced IMO.  The sandwiches, however, are a great value, and paired with a large side of tots, you can't go wrong.    The beer selection here is really good, and consistently changes.  They might have one or two crap macro drafts, but the rest are solid micro drafts.   Did I mention the $3.25 drafts for late night and happy hour?  All drafts are 1/2 priced except for 10%+ beers, and they pour beers into pint glasses....good luck getting a $3 pint of Pumking at Fat Heads!    P.S. get a restaurant.com gift certificate; you can use them on alcohol, during happy hour (at least last time I was there you could.)"}
{"text":"I just have to say its sad that I've not experienced some of the great wings I've heard so much about! I ordered chicken Parmesan and was so excited to dive into my half off happy hour wings! You get 10 whole wings for five bucks... That's gotta excite you!   Sad thing was, they were tasteless and greasy.  I kept biting into them thinking it would get better. I assure you, it did not. I ate three and had to stop.  It was like eating grease flavored chicken.    The only redeeming thing about the meal was the tomato salad with huge pieces of mozzarella cheese. I really want to like this place... And I'll probably be back at some point. Heck, they still server beer.  That's good enough for me!  Hoping and wishing it will turn around though!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times before and always loved their happy hour with half price small plates and drink specials; food has always been tasty and it was a good deal!   We went last night for an actual dinner and had a pretty rough experience...  - What happened          --- What should have happened  - Brother got a diet coke and was presented with a 16oz bottle (not even 20oz!) and charged $2.75 for it with no acknowledgement of it.  I've definitely had soda from a gun here before.           --- \"Unfortunately our fountain machine is down; is a bottle ok?\"  - Ordered a 'pre-made' pizza that said no substitutions, which is totally understandable, but we weren't allowed to take something OFF of the pizza?          ---  Don't make me eat mushrooms  - After 40 minutes of waiting for our food with only a handful of other tables around us, I asked the server and she agreed it was too long and went and asked about it; we were told \"Well, they burned your pizza so they just put another one in so it'll be a few more minutes\"          --- Come to me before I have to wait 40 minutes and explain the situation so we know what's going on; maybe offer us a quick snack to munch on to hold us over.  -  Finally get all of our food; we got the Opedius Rex pizza that was mediocre, WAY too much garlic and we love garlic; crust was great though!  Chili cheese dog special was a good deal and tasted good from what I heard.  The server said the manager comped our meals (thanks!) but still charged us for the soda?        --- Just comp the whole meal; it was weird and the server felt super uncomfortable handing it to us.  Don't worry, we were still going to tip her and we tipped her well. She was great though the whole experience and we know it wasn't her fault.   - Asked to see the manager to see what was up with the evening; I've worked in a few restaurants and you never know what's going on behind the scenes.  Server comes back and says, \"She's upstairs right now, she'll be down in a little bit\"  I asked her to clarify and said, \"So she's not coming right now?  She'll be down later??\"  And the server said yes.      ---  When an unhappy customer asks to speak to the manager (female, I think, Sue?), you don't make them wait!  I was mildly unhappy initially after everything that happened, but when the manager chose to avoid me and the situation, that's what stoked the flames.  From reading some other reviews, looks like this manager has caused some other problems as well (Michael M.'s review from 12/28/15).  Sorry Library, our gym is in the South Side and we are often going to restaurants in the area, but will not be back; plenty of other great spots to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I love this bar! It has great beer on tap, although they do change it up every day so if your find your new favorite, drink up! It might not be there the next day. Their small plates are also very good. I have tried the mussels, the mini burgers, and the pepperoni rolls - all great! The bar tenders are friendly and let you try out various beers, and the crowd is pretty low key. All is all, great spot!"}
{"text":"The Library is my new favorite late-night place for drinks and food. They're open until 2am daily. This makes me very happy, as my \"weekend\" begins on Sunday night.   They have two happy hours: 5-7pm and 9-11pm. Happy hour specials include $3.25 drafts and \"energy bombs\" (any pinnacle vodka mixed with energy drink), and half off all appetizers.  The names of all food are derived from literary titles, apropos for a restaurant called the \"Library.\" Cute.   I almost always get the mussels in white sauce. SO tasty. Try it. You'll be asking for more bread to dip in the sauce.    My favorite entrees include the \"Light in the Attic\" salad and the \"Catch 22\", which is buffalo chicken (or turkey/bacon) and cheese wrapped in pizza dough. Delicious!  It's a friendly, casual restaurant with a great beer selection and specials.  Can't ask for much more.  EDIT: I'm docking the Library a star because the last few times I've been, service has been TERRIBLE.  Once, on an early evening out, I read the beer specials on their chalkboard and picked one. The waitress said \"we don't have that.\" So I chose another. That was gone, too. She also seemed confused when I told her to bring something similar to my other choices.   On another occasion, we went for a friend's birthday and he wanted an ice cream sundae. The waiter brought him plain a bowl of ice cream. We thought he had misheard, so we informed the waiter that no, a bowl of ice cream was not a complete sundae. He rolled his eyes and said \"well I guess I can get them to put chocolate sauce on it.\" Bad form, Library."}
{"text":"I love the Library for a couple of reasons.   1. They have not one but 2 happy hours. 5-7 and 9-11 3.25 beers and 3.25  Pinnacle Vodka Bombs, mixed drinks and shots. If that wasn't enough they have half off small plates aka appetizers from 5-7 and 9-1AM.   2. Atmosphere! Jukebox so you can play your song for everyone to hear, pool table, darts upstairs and down. porch with hanging lights makes a pretty place to eat and take a date.   3. Beer! They are always kicking kegs and bringing in new beers. You can never predict what beers they will have because their selection varies so much which is amazing for someone like me that loves trying new beers and gets bored of the same old selection.   4. Pulled pork Nachos, which is a small plate so they are only $5 during the happy hours."}
{"text":"The best fried pickles you will ever have.  Some people brag that they're a connoisseur of cheese, wine, and other shmancy things.  I'm a fried food connoisseur with a specific interest in pickles.  Go here and enjoy.  Chicken tenders and sweet potato fries good as well.  Great happy hour specials, and an overall nice place with with a cozy feel."}
{"text":"Well, I live about a block or two away fromt his spot, just moved there. I am from this area of Pittsburgh but never started going to the Library until I moved here. My first impression is of the door guy, he is awkward and different in his own way never very friendly but not rude in anyway! I never went upstairs until last night. I have always stayed true to the downstairs bar. I have had one or two differnt bartenders they are both sweet and happy girls seem to be in their late 20's. After about 12 times of enjoying myself at my secret get-away, I had a terrible experience. :(   I invited all of my friends there 5-10-16 and two of us had a beer and then split a bottle of $52 wine that was half off. ( Saviuagn Blanc) It was delicious and all was well. After our wine we ordered a shot for celebration. Not a straight shot but a mixed shot called \"Green tea\". (Peach schnapps, sours, jameson and sprite). Both of us happen to be bartenders and worked together in the past. We had not seen eachother in almost a year and we were celebrating a special occassion. Sarah our bartender re- turned with our shot and we asked to close out our tabs. After filling out the tab and generously tipping Sarah, we took our shots. To find out there was nothing in the glass but sours mix. (If you have ever drank this straight it is very tart and like instant heartburn) Very upset, but still polite we explained to Sarah our devistation. She defended herself saying she had made the shot correctly and would not compensate us in any way even though we were there from 7 until 1am and had been regular or even ideal bar patrons. My friend got a little mad and we decide we would take our business upstairs to the other bartender and then walk home. Once arriving upstairs we waitied in line at the bar where a male bartender was working with dar medium lenghth brown hair. We placed our order with him for again two green tea shots! His response was the last that I ever expected! He said that he recieved a phone call from our previous bartender downstairs and she said not serve us! I was furious! So very furios. I had spent $130 in food and drinks for my boyfriend and I and even paid for the shots that were not made correctly! Not including my friends who were there who also spent money.  This all took place because I called her (SARAH) out for serving me sours as a shot! From a bartender to a bartender.. If you feel someone has had enough to drink and they order a shot.. TELL THEM NO! Don't make them some bullshit and charge them for it. Especially when they are not even drunk and will remember your name, and face and leave a terrible yelp review for your boss to read! Thanks. You lost a customer."}
{"text":"The Library was my favorite neighborhood bar when I lived off of East Carson. They sincerely have the BEST deals in town.   I adored the fact that their menus were all created from library books and that the menu items all had literary symbolism. It really helped pull in the entire atmosphere.  Their beer selection was fantastic and though I don't know if it still exists, they had an incredibly generous happy hour and reverse happy hour where you could get great beer deals and discounted apps. It was a brilliant way to make a repeat customer out of me.  The food is bar food, but certainly a step above greasy, toss into the fryer and slap it on a disposable plate type of food. Their Where the Wild Things Are chicken tenders were a great app to split and were served with fabulous dipping sauces. If I were feeling gluttonous, I would order the Animal Farm sandwich, which was a tasty, salty turkey sandwich with bacon and a friend egg, dripping with gouda. SO GOOD!  Their pizza is great to split, though when I dined there, the cooks had their good days and bad days with it.  I was also always a fan of their staff. They made sure to remember my name and beer preferences and always greeted me with a smile.   The Library is one of the many things I miss about PGH and I certainly hope to make it there soon. The Library will be one of my first stops."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Happy hour specials were great, too. Get the \"Animal Farm\" sandwich -- really good! We upgraded for pretzels on the side. Yum!"}
