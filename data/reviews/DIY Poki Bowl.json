{"text":"I have driven past this place tons of times without realizing it was there. Went there for the first time because of a friend's reccomendation. First off, let me say that I have worked in the meat/seafood industry for years, so I can tell when fish isn't fresh, but this place was excellent. I love that they are friendly and insist on you trying a few sauces before you make your decision. Their yellowtail was super fresh, no fishy smell/flavor, amd so was their ahi tuna. They had a massive set of options available for what you want in your bowl/roll. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Omg! If I could eat here everyday I would! Super delicious! Great selections and always good promotions! Today's was an extra scoop of fish free! Clean establishment, nice atmosphere and delightful staff. Please visit!! I hope it's here forever!"}
{"text":"Tonight I tried the Rising Sun and have to say I was in heaven! Everything was fresh and the flavor was on point! This is going to be a regular place for me. It's clean, friendly, and great fast service! Excited to have this place close to home!"}
{"text":"Since finding this place two weeks ago we have been here five times! It's our new go to! The staff is always super nice and accommodating and the special sauces sets the place apart from the other similar concepts. No complicated menus, fresh products and clean place. The free miso soup is a plus for us and we love it. Probably will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Super delicious, quick and easy, and fresh!  Love the DIY burrito!  We frequently come on our lunch break.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"The employees are super friendly and hard working! The food is amazing and refreshing. I'm so glad I found this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight.. and the restaurant was clean and the food tasted fresh.  Also free beer. Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I have gone in there many times, convenient since I work close and quality of fish is good! Walked in 5 minutes before opening time and they both looked at me and said we are not open..... wtf kind of service is this every time I go in there the 3500 square foot place is dead I'm the only one in there and if you don't want to serve your clients, lock the door! This is embarrassing this place will be shut down soon"}
{"text":"Waaay Over priced. For not that great of good. A dollar extra for avocado and an extra dollar for soy paper. The other sushi places down eastern are cheaper and better."}
{"text":"The food here is refreshing! The restaurant is close to my house so I usually stop by once a week."}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious! The food is so fresh. Went here because my favorite, I Love Sushi, was closed. I'm so glad I took the chance because it was absolutely deeeelicious! I will be coming back regularly. Yuuuummmmmyyyy"}
{"text":"First time and I loved it!! Super fresh, great options, and friendly service. I'm fussy about my ahi, but i have no complaints. Restaurant is new, clean, and pleasant!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is so good but I'm so disappointed with the people that work there. I when to there last night arrived around 9:05 pm when they said they close at 9:30pm (its written on the door hours of operation) and the girl told me they where close. Then I decided to come today arrived 11 am when they said they are open at 11 am and the same girl told me they are close. WTF so disappointed."}
{"text":"Really like this place a lot! Everything here is top notch-always fresh and delicious. They really care about their ingredients. Everyone working there is awesome.i love this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm sooo happy I have DIY  POKY BOWL a try. The fish is fresh, sauce is so good especially the spicy cream one. The great thing about it is I can do salad bowl instead of rice since I'm on sugar detox diet. Staff is very nice and friendly . Overall super satisfied and I'm coming back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Just what we needed a healthy DIY sushi burrito. No more driving across town for good sushi craving fix. Everything was delicious and great service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. They have a good menu for the poke bowls and sushi burritos. The place is very clean and spacious. The food was very good also.  The problem I had was with the service. Since I came here with my family, we had a coupon for half off the second poke bowl or sushi burrito of equal value or less. I got a poke bowl combo, a second poke bowl and a kid's meal. The total came out to more than what I was expecting after the 50% off coupon.  Apparently, they applied the coupon discount to the kid's meal ($5.95), which was only shrimp & rice and NOT towards the second poke bowl. I questioned of why it was not applied to the second bowl. They said it applies to items of lesser value, obviously the kid's meal. So I paid full price for the second poke bowl. WOW...talk about misleading the consumers on the 50% off coupon, if I had known I would've paid for the kids meal separately! Furthermore, as I pointed it out to the cashier, she insisted it was listed on the coupon. Talk about very bad service and misleading on the discount! I'm not coming back here. Beware if using their coupons."}
{"text":"I love that not only do I not have to drive clear across town to W. Sahara now but three Poke Bowl/sushi burrito places have opened on this side of town!!!! Love the staff! I really love that they are never really busy but I hope they stay in business because of the short wait times."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!! Perfect in every way!!! Food is fresh and worth every penny!  I recommend the DYI make your own Poke bowl, it's everything I want in sushi quality fish with the seaweed salad and edamame included . They also have Mochi Ice Cream in MANGO- my fav!!! AND they deliver and take cash payment- bye bye Postmates!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! So in love with this place! The food is amazing, fish is fresh and delicious and their sauces are super yummy!!! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  No wait.  Friendly.  Good value. This is the 2nd time visiting this location."}
{"text":"The Burritos are excellent ! Even my mother in law loves the place and she hates fish, so there you go !"}
{"text":"Tried this place the other day and I loved it! I got a poke bowl (with salad) but the fish tasted fresh and the spicy tuna was the perfect amount of spicy. They have other types of fish too, and I plan on getting the salmon next time. They offer a lot of nice sides as well. It was about $13 total for the salad with 3 scoops of spicy tuna, and that included the avocado. So it's moderately priced. But it tasted great! I'll definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Found out about this location through a flyer in the mail. It was their grand opening today. The restaurant itself is very modern. Has music playing through out the place. It has bowls or burrito you can order from the set menu or you can custom make your own. I had the DIY Burrito from the set menu. It reminds me of a Subway, where you can see the food that they prep from. All the seafood looks fresh. The burrito I had, included spicy tuna, crabmeat and yellowtail. Jalape√±o, avacado, cucumber and masago finished it off. The staff is friendly and helpful. The burrito price and size is about average to other places I tried around town. The fish is really fresh and tasty. So if your around the Anthem Hills area, should stop by and give it a try."}
{"text":"Never really tried Poke before and was recommended here by a friend. The food was delicious and I'm sure to be coming back! It's also one of the healthier options in the area which is conveniently next to the gym I go to."}
{"text":"Food is fresh which is exactly what you want from a sushi restaurant! Clean friendly atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Just stop by the place and decided to give it a shot. I ordered A bowl and A burrito as my dinner. The poke bowl was really awesome,fresh Ahi tuna&scallop were both my favorite for my poke bowl. For the sushi burrito, I built it by myself. (I Have to say) Raw fish with some mango were so delicious, excellent. What are you waiting for? Go ahead to get some poke bowl that made by yourself!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I think the sauce I got was the DIY sauce? - if I remember it correctly- and i really liked it. I had to give it a 3 star because it's overpriced. I always make my own bowl and order the same exact thing at different sushi bowl/burrito place in vegas. It usually costs me $8-9, but at this place it's always $12. Also, they're not too friendly. Every time I go in, the employees just stand there and stare at my face without even saying hi and wait until I start ordering. Yes the food is good, but customer service is important too when it comes to doing business- in my opinion..."}
{"text":"Clean and inviting dining room, fresh ingredients, nice staff. I had a DIY burrito for $10. They offer plenty of protein, I had ahi tuna, salmon, and spicy tuna with a ton of veggies, and a delicious spicy mayo. They also offered free infused water, today it was like and mint. I don't get to Henderson that often, but I will remember this place when I am in the neighborhood. I frequent other sushi burrito shops in town that are a couple dollars less per burrito than this shop, but here they give generous scoops of protein, and you can choose 3 different types per burrito, so I think it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Driving down Eastern Ave wanting a fast, inexpensive, fairly healthy lunch. DIY Poki Bowl seemed to fit the bill. You place your order at the counter. This was my first time in a Poki Bowl restaurant, so I needed a lot of help. The servers were really friendly and helpful. My overall impression is that this has a lot in common with a Chipotle type set up, except Japanese-style not Mexican. You go down the line and make choices as to what you want put in your bowl. Being not too adventuresome, I figured I would go with a preconfigured bowl. Their namesake bowl seemed safest. It came with rice (white or brown), 2 types of tuna (Ahi & yellowtail), eel, lots of avocado, seaweed salad, and house sauce. You get to choose hot jalepeno or marinated. Having a Gringo palate, I oped for the marinated. Good choice for me. the meal was delish. And very filling. This is a definite repeat lunch place for me."}
{"text":"Had a bowl and sushi burrito made to my tastes.  Fish super fresh.  Veggies crunchy. Sauces were wonderful. Will be here regularly."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! Very clean great choice for healthy eating. Our choice when we are in town for a quick delicious meal"}
{"text":"Pretty good but there's a lot of competition in the poke bowl/sushi burrito arena. The handful of times we were there, there were hardly any customers and it's pretty spacious = high overhead. I think the restaurant's days are numbered.   Also, I agree with another reviewer that the workers seem to be somewhat unsure of how to explain what is available which can create ordering anxiety (for me, anyway)."}
{"text":"There are tons of poke bowl places in town now, and this one didn't do it for me. Despite the name, they do have some pre-set bowl and burrito combos rather than an all DIY concept. I tried their namesake DIY Specialty Bowl and the ingredients didn't really work well together and didn't seem all that fresh. Pricing is high for the portion compared to other similar businesses, but there's also a ton of rice resulting in less toppings. Service was friendly and location is spacious, but if I'm wanting a poke bowl in the area, there are other options I'd pick first."}
{"text":"Fish and vegis so fresh! Love the mango in my sushi burrito. Great sauces, and they will give you samples so you can decide. Excellent value, three of us ate for $32.00 during happy hour! Clean, fresh, economical way to get sushi, poki bowl or salad."}
{"text":"Very clean and modern looking. Nice and friendly people. Mostly great tasty food. Will definitely be coming back for more :-)"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi burrito poke place in Vegas, IMHO. The fishes are fresh (please keep it up this way), masago is free (included), mango is sweet, they have tamago as toppings, and the yum yum sauce is delicious !!   I tried 4-5 other different sushi burritos poke places  but so far this is the best quality for your buck. Good value, quality, and delicious.   The people work here don't rush you. Very friendly and respectful.   We will keep coming back!   The tinting of the window is dark so they may look closed but check it out and they probably open"}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love this place. Eat here!!!  Super healthy and great friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best sushi burrito I have had in town! Great toppings, fresh fish.  Create your own and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fish quality is top notch here,  all the sauces are amazing and totally adds to every burrito you make. You can make your own or choose from their creations, either way they are all pretty tasty. My favorite is the Zen though. Gotta give that one a try. They run specials here and there and are fairly priced for good sushi grade fish. Totally recommend trying them out,  my whole family enjoyed their sushi burritos."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!! I have never had a poke bowl and boy have I been missing out! I just happened upon this place on Yelp and SO glad I did! I had the make my own poke bowl option and it was perfection! Everything was so fresh and delicious and filling! Service was quick and friendly, I will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing !! Food was fresh, and tasty....staff was awesome and made great suggestions.....I definitely will come back here !"}
{"text":"Amazing friendly staff! They always greet me with amazing energy, and they suggest and modify the bowls to fit my diet. Fish is super fresh!! Location is hidden off in the corner but, the restaurant is super clean! Love it."}
{"text":"This place is great! Perfect for a quick stop and to cure your sushi fix! Everything is always super fresh, the customer service is always on point and the bowls taste amazing!! Its always worth drive for me and I will definitely continue coming back"}
{"text":"So damn good! I got the burrito with crab, spicy tuna and shrimp for protein, cucumber, green onion, crunch and spicy mayo as the filler. Amazing. Great price too."}
{"text":"Love!  Loved my sushi burrito! The fish was not mush and wrapped very well there wasn't a lot of rice so I was definitely getting equal fish/rice/veggie.  Awesome service and super fast delivery. Definitely definitely ordering again"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Friendly, great food & good prices.  Healthy, quick & the fish is always fresh. Quite a variety as well Will be returning at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I have to admit to being very skeptical about trying any place that has their sushi fish sitting out pre-cut in refrigerated bins, but to my pleasure everything tasted very fresh and delicious.  I went with a couple friends for lunch and we each made custom bowls with various fish, seaweed, rice, vegetables and sauces.  It was such a good experience that we all agreed we'd make this a regular lunch spot.  The prices are quite fair and with an unlimited soda dispenser, there was not much more we could ask for."}
{"text":"Totally loved it! Healthy and yummy! Big portions, very clean and good service"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Poke/Sushi burrito spot around, been to most of the other ones in the area and just doesn't compare to how fresh their food is and how delicious it tastes!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice and absolutely love it! Everything tastes great and the girl that was helping me (wears glasses light hair) is extremely nice and helpful. She has a sunny disposition and a very welcoming personality.   They offer a 15% discount for students and military, which is awesome! I love a place that supports the military! Not only that, but they're always running some sort of special. This place is definitely a good find and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Three minutes after getting my food, it was in the trash and I was out the door.  Warm raw fish is UNACCEPTABLE!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin....I decided to give this place a try after stopping by the bank. Worst experience of my life. First off, I don't think the owners of this establishment know that they have competition on the same street. There are plenty of poke places I can go to, that are far better than this one. First off, what's with the attitude? It's my first time at this establishment. If I don't know what to get, at least help me out. Don't just point and walk away. Second, who in the world would pay for those portions especially when your competitors offer more. Third, if i want a new bowl cuz the salmon in my bowl tastes terrible, then try to fix the problem. Don't tell me I don't know what good fish taste like. I tasted rank fish. End of story. Anyway, don't give this place your business. They make a mockery of you if you have questions and they treat you like shit"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by D.I.Y. We're huge sushi snobs and always eat at I Love Sushi. D.I.Y. surpassed our expectations. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful. The Zen bowl was super tasty and hubby loved his D.I.Y burrito. Try it for a quick, chill bite."}
{"text":"After a flyer was put on my car I figured I'd give this place a shot. All I can say is that I've been coming here at least twice  a week for the last 4 weeks. Good customer service,  great quality food, great portions! My go toos are the DIY bowl and  DIY burrito! Keep up the good work and quality!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I follow a fairly strict eating plan and they were more than willing to accommodate my wishes"}
{"text":"There's no burrito. It's a glorified roll. If you're going to coin the word burrito in your items, make sure you've got more diversity in your menu. You've got the sushi part right with all the seafood, but no chicken or steak. Such an easy fix, and would definitely bring more people in."}
{"text":"In a land full of Sushi Burritos and Chipotle styled restaurants this one is just meh.   Normally, I try to give to places the benefit of the doubt, but the menu here is very boring, and the food is so-so. The layout of this place is cafeteria style; you line up, get food, and sit.  They offer pre-made bowls, \"burritos,\" and customizable options hence the name DIY. I chose to build my own burrito with spicy tuna, shrimp, edamame, jalape√±o, masago, cucumber and a bottled spicy sauce. This might be my fault because I DIY'd it, but the flavors just weren't there for me. Most everything was bland and seemed pre-prepped from the day before, you'd think with all that goodness wrapped in a giant sushi roll it would be delicious, but no, just a dry, flavorless mess.   Let's chalk this up to DIY being pretty new, but I don't think I will find myself coming back here. There are just too many SB options in the Henderson area to waste another fifteen dollars on a lackluster sushi burrito and drink."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Pok√© so when a friend recommended this spot I thought I'd check it out. I love the option to make your own bowls.   Very spacious place. Very clean. I ordered the Zen Bowl $10.55 - Ahi Tuna, salmon, lettuce, green onion, red onion, cucumber, and seaweed salad with spicy garlic ponzu sauce. I added a few extra items at no extra cost. That is a nice option.   The only thing I wish I did was ask for the sauce on the side, they drizzled sauce on my bowl about 3 times over and it was too much for me. My bowl was slightly drenched in the sauce. Not terrible because the sauce was good but I like my sauce in moderation.  They had a cool feature with \"Spin the Wheel\" for a chance to win free items or discounts. I personally got 10% which was cool."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this establishment. The sushi is fresh. The place is clean. The staff are friendly. The seaweed salad is so good on top of a sushi poki bowl."}
{"text":"I love this new place it's a nice healthy addition to the neighborhood,  the fish and ingredients are nice and fresh.  The sauces are amazing poke sauce and service is very friendly they don't disappoint go try it! It's adicitive."}
{"text":"I made my own sushi burrito. The flavors were great! But the burrito fell apart on me straight out of the wrapper. Very messy. Otherwise it was a fantastic sushi burrito!!"}
{"text":"First time my companion and I tried sushi burrito.  We really like the over-size sushi roll stuffed with delicious and fresh ingredients.  Clean eatery with friendly and helpful staff.  We definitely will eat there again and will recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"You can either get a bowl of rice or a giant hand roll aka sushi burrito. You get 2 scoops of fish/ protein and you can dress up your dish with all the veggies you like. Avocado costs extra. They're open for lunch and late into the evening so I can grab a quick, light dinner if I've been working late. The restaurant is really big for what they serve. It seems like this place could be half the size since so much of their business is \"to go.\" But I do love that it's a local spot in a busy shopping center so I can get my errands done and grab a bite at the same time."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood and fish. So many options for topping and a great kids meal!!!! Super clean and friendly staff"}
{"text":"I try so hard not to come every day they always give you a good portion of your food and the flavors are incredible. I always get a large bowl and I'm able to have it twice in one day and the fish is always fresh. The staff is nice as well."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because I was wanting sushi and it had good reviews. It was so delicious. I got the spicy tuna, white rice, and lettuce - toppings were : cucumber, fresh jalape√±os, avocado, red and green onion and tempura crunch. Sauce: spicy mayo, house sauce, spicy ponzu and one other one that I can't remember. I was more then happy about my choice and it was very satisfying. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It was okay but hit the spot. Fish is okay, sauces are okay too. Rice could be better. Nothing bad, I have just tried better"}
{"text":"Love this place for getting my sushi fix without breaking the bank. Everything is always fresh and they are very friendly and accommodating. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went there because I wanted to try a new poki place by my house and I have to say now I will always be going back !! I loved it ! It was so good and fresh ! And the service is excellent !"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the amount of mediocre food you get and everything else is an up-charge. Had to wait for my order in the store despite placing it 30 minutes before I left to pick it up. Wish they had more sauce options on the menu as well. Spare yourself and just go to Sweet Poke."}
{"text":"I love the poke here. It's so good and fresh and clean as well. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Free beer as well.. The best..."}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry, DO NOT use the online pre-order feature! I purposely placed my order for a hour after they opened as to avoid the unorganized crunch of any store opening. Due to a broken ankle I had to call Uber anx got there 15 minutes after the time I requested the order be ready. 2 customers in the place, and already seated, so they were not busy at all. When I asked about my order, I was looked at like ' Huh'. Order wasnt even started. So as I'm paying an Uber driver to sit and wait, 10 minutes later(for 2 damn sushi burritos), I finally get my order. 3 people behind the counter and 2 of them stood and watched as the 3rd, and very apparent brand new person, struggled to put together the order. What a waste of damn time!   The only reason that I'm giving 2 stars is that the fish was cold and the ingredient mix I chose was killer. Mango, Cream Cheese, Ahi & Yum Yum Sauce is the ticket!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Poke bowls I've enjoyed. Tucked away in the Smith's shopping center at the corner of Eastern and W. Horizon Ridge, don't miss this hidden gem!   Friendly and polite staff and clean restaurant. Top notch sushi rice and quality fish. I had the Salmon, tuna and crab in a bowl with house sauce and added avocado at a small up charge. Delish! Lots of fresh topping to choose from included in the price. If you don't want to \"DIY\" it there are recommended combinations to order from as well and beer options too."}
{"text":"Really great place for poke bowls. I always do the DIY bowl where you can mix and match any ingredient you like. Some of the extras do cost a bit (seaweed salad and avocados are $1+ each, which tend to add up), but overall they make great bowls for relatively inexpensive prices. Also, when you go to pay, they let you spin a wheel that can net you cool things like another bowl for 1/2 off, and 15 or 30% on your current order."}
{"text":"I had the Cancun Poke Bowl with half white rice and half salad, and it was delicious! The staff is very professional and friendly. I will definitely be eating here again in the very near future."}
{"text":"Amazing Poke bowls! The fish is super fresh and the bowls are beautifully made. Love that they offer options other than tuna. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"DIY Burrito and Angry Bowl had great flavor and the ingredients tasted fresh. The interior of the store is clean. I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good fish  was fresh and delicious spicy ponzu garlic sauce was awesome will. Definitely go back for the Las Vegas burrito"}
{"text":"First things first.  Spell poke right.  Its different all over the signs, shirts, menus, etc.  This place follows the Subway/Chipotle of making you food your own by choosing what goes into it from a large selection.  I ordered a Zen bowl.  There is a ton of sushi rice in there that was pretty good, a ton of salad on the top of that, and I would say about 1/8 lb of poke in total.  The meal was decent, but the ratios of rice/salad/fish was just off.  The poke itself was fresh tasting, but still rather plain tasting despite the garlic ponzu sauce.  I would have paid a few dollars more just for poke (alone) and forget the salad and rice, but that wasn't on the menu.  One cool thing they did have was legit Huy Fong sriracha packets!  I was dying to try this place for weeks once I saw it... And now that I have I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good poke bowl.  Fresh fish, good sticky rice, and sauces.  Friendly staff.  I enjoy sushi several times per month and now look forward to a quick lunch at this place.  I first found out about them on 24 hr Eats app."}
{"text":"I usually don't come to this side of town for my poke fix, but decided to give it a try.  Came in around 4pm and the place was a ghost town.  No big deal, right? I'll just get served first.  It was your typical poke fare - pick your carb, protein, sides, sauce.  It was cool that they sauce up your proteins and then offer you more/or even a different sauce to put on top of the whole bowl.  A nice plus is that they can wrap it for you in seaweed like a big sushi burrito.  It was nice that their ingredients were all clearly labeled and you could easily read what you want, however - their counter setup is so high that you can barely see the ingredients.  In my opinion, part of the whole (I hate to call it subway experience.. but I digress) is to see the ingredients that they are putting into your bowl/burrito.  Who doesn't want to see fresh ingredients?? Lower that counter about 6 inches and you'll improve your customer experience.. I promise you.  At the end of the line, they even had a wheel that they let us spin for discounts or free soup, etc.  This was a nice bonus.  I don't know that I would go out of my way to come here again, but the lady working was nice.  I wish they were a little more generous in their bowl portion though because other players in town won't leave you hungry over a $11-12 poke bowl.  I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Something different, something fusion, something DIY?  I had the sushi burrito combo with salmon, yellowtail, cucumbers, jalapenos, masago, and yum yum sauce.  It's a giant hand roll with all the fixens.  My wife had the same with spicy tuna instead and it was just as good.   Miso soup was good as well.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"There are a lot of new poke shops opening up in the Anthem area, and only one of them has exceeded my expectations! However, not DIY. They don't even spell poke correctly. I was going to go somewhere across the street but decided on trying DIY Poki after seeing it many times when I would be in the parking lot. I was really hungry, so I gave it a shot. I went inside and the staff was not friendly at all. They did not communicate the options or toppings to me correctly, but I was still optimistic for the taste of the bowl. The main reason I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because it wasn't very expensive, and they offered a student discount. I took it to go, and had noticed before I started eating that the bowl itself was really small for a medium (or regular, can't remember their sizing). She piled way too much rice in it, and barely put in any fish or toppings. I remained optimistic, when I tried it I was extremely disappointed to say the least. I have seen their wonderful reviews, and I am always more than happy to eat a poke bowl, and this what not the case with this bowl. Fish was not good at all, toppings weren't good, rice was really bad, and it just wasn't a good combo all together. Will be sticking to my usual poke spot unless something drastically improves!"}
{"text":"It's a good place. I admire that regardless that they are never very busy they keep offering fresh seafood. That's what keeps me coming back. If one day they stop serving fresh food I'll never return. Keep trying DIY. We know it's hard!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. The food tastes great and I'd definitely come back for it. You're given a lot of food so it's worth the price. I got the diy poke bowl without the house sauce. Heads up, the house sauce has some spice in it. The staff was awesome enough to make me another once I realized that too late. Mind you, I'm a huge wimp when it comes to spicy food. I would recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"First timer. Absolutely \"Ono\" delicious!!!! My taste buds are super happy right now. I'm gonna be hooked. Their DIY House Sauce is to die for. The Poki sauce is amazing. And all of the xtra toppings, I can't explain. Just go and eat there"}
{"text":"There was only one other girl ahead of me in line when I went, so I got to start ordering super quick. Lots of choices, everything was straight forward (which I love), and all the items were labeled behind the glass. That made it so much easier to decide without having to think too hard - because honestly who likes thinking when your tummy is grumbling. Staff was so nice, they were all smiles the entire time. Even offered me a free soda, which was cool, even though I didn't take it! The food was amazing, tasted so fresh even though it was a few hours to closing. Will return!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great amount of food for the price. Fish always tastes fresh, and they have a great amount of add ons. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a poke bowl. The place is always clean and the staff is very friendly. They're generous in their toppings and have more choices than most places and don't nickel and dime for everything. Sure there are a few things that are a bit extra but most of it isn't. Always fresh."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The poke bowls were delicious and the portions were great. But it's not just poke, they have a lot of choices that I think we'll satisfy anyone. It has a good atmosphere and the employees were very kind and helpful."}
{"text":"DIY is my favorite place when I'm craving a Poke bowl. The freshness of their ingredients and being greeted with a smile every time, Gets me to come back. The Resturant is clean and inviting. I live a few miles away and it's worth the drive. If your a poke fan. This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very good poke bowls and very generous portions. All poke is fresh and veggies are delicious, crisp and bountiful. Service is very friendly. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Yep this place has legit Poke bowls.....12.50 for a Large bowl......can't beat that. Service is good too. I went twice in 24 hours and I will be back......don't hurt its 5 minutes from the crib."}
{"text":"Delicious! There are many options of seafood, both cooked and raw. Lots of add ons available for bowls and the sauces are yum! I loved the house sauce as had a hint of spice but sweet and salty too. Service is friendly and super helpful. Overall a great experience! We're already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh this place is awesome!! My son and I ordered DIY Sushi Burritos and they were fantastic! Yummy and fresh. Can't wait to go back and try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!  I love the concept of this menu.  Your choice...period.  You get to choose bowl or burrito style.  The proteins, veggies and fruits are all very fresh, beautiful and delicious.  Extremely healthy and tasty.  Not always a combination you can find.  You can eat at the restaurant or take it to go."}
{"text":"Out of all of the Poki places this one is hands down my favorite.. the way they cut there veggies .. love the pickled"}
{"text":"Oh myyyyy do they give you a lot of rice. Fish tasted very fresh. What I liked about their yellowtail was there wasn't any of that sliver of skin on the fish like to see roll. To see roll was my go to but now I'll definitely be returning here for my poke bowls. Wait staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and super helpful. I got the regular bowl with brown rice and yellowtail and salmon for my protein. They had some interesting toppings like mango and pineapple which was different but I liked it. Added a change of flavor to the fish. I would recommend making your own vs getting the pre made one."}
{"text":"There are plenty of poke choices on Eastern from the 215 to Sunridge Heights, so it says something about DIY Poki Bowl for me to write a review.    Tucked in the Smith's shopping center.  It's an easy in-and-out of the plaza on the Tuesday Morning side.  Been here a handful of time, and each time I come in, I am greeted by enthusiastic staff who are eager to help with my indecisiveness.    My favorite is the DIY Poki Bowl and they always accommodate to my distaste for tuna and give me additional salmon or yellowtail instead.  In the month of May, they even had specials for a free miso soup, mochi or a fountain drink.    For the price, I think it's definitely more bang for your bucks because they don't overfill the bowl with rice but definitely give you more than enough on the fish.    The place is pretty big with sufficient seating, which is what I found to be a disappointment at other poke places - lack of seating.    I definitely recommend DIY Poki and will be coming back here myself."}
{"text":"If this was closer to me, I would be there quite often. They do not skimp on fish, veggie, or toppings. What I really like is that they have such a wide variety of toppings--octopus salad, tamago, wasabi masago(!), tofu, and all of the usual veg. Fish tastes fresh, sauces are great, and service is good.   You really get a nice size bowl for your money. A lot of other poke bowl places overcharged and don't give you enough, not so here."}
{"text":"One of my biggest complaints (ok, only) about most sushi places is that they don't let me build my own rolls. Well, no more! Brown rice? Albacore AND salmon? Cilantro, green onions, mango, asparagus? Crazily mixing spicy ponzu with sesame poki? The entire rainbow of masago? Oh, yeah, baby, I'm in!  Since it's build-your-own (compare to Blaze Pizza or Subway), you could go all veggie, if you wanted to. I mean...if that's your thing...  The service was courteous, knowledgeable and swift. The portions were generous. The ingredients were fresh and high quality. The restaurant itself was clean and well maintained.  Great concept executed well."}
{"text":"Love this place. I was skeptical to try it at first. A sushi burrito? Hhhmmm... glad I did! Well, I actually haven't tried a burrito yet, but I LOVE the bowls!   My favorite is the Zen bowl. I get brown rice, add spicy mayo to my salmon and tuna, and add cream cheese and the dry seaweed shaker stuff on top. Soooo good. I have also tried getting lettuce on the bottom of the bowl under the rice. This means less rice.   Very friendly staff (the college girl with the short hair is our favorite!), clean dining room, good drink selection. Includes a mint water.   Most recently went to their \"first 100 people get a free poke bowl/burrito\" day. It was really organized and moved quickly.   We will definitely be back for many more bowls!"}
{"text":"Nice place to get a bowl.  They allow you to customize anything and only a few side items are extra and they do let you know about them.  Wish they had more fish options, but I'm sure that will come with time."}
{"text":"This is fantastic little find!! You can either do a sushi burrito or sushi bowl. You can build your own or you can choose their signature items!! Everything in their sushi bar set up looked extremely clean, and the sushi, specifically salmon & yellowtail tasted fresh!! Something different they had here, which I wasn't a personal fan of but I know many people who would enjoy it was their spicy masago. It's masago tossed in wasabi. While I love masago, I'm not a fan of wasabi. But it was something fun to try! The staff was sweet, and welcoming, and for the month of June they offer a free extra scoop!!! Awesome!! Definitely a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time for a quick bite to satisfy my sushi craving. Customized my sushi burrito and got a watermelon slush. Everything was really tasty! Watermelon slush was yummy and refreshing. Especially on a hot Vegas summer day. Would definitely come back. (:"}
{"text":"Fairly standard poke place, price is ok. Reg bowl is 2 scoops. Some options are a little limited with no spicy crab. Variety of veg is good. Small things that can be fixed we're chopping up the jalape√±o smaller and taking the damn cilantro leaves off the stem- cmon now. Student and active military discounts at 15 percent. Unfortunately there are a lot of other better poke places in town, this one is meh. 1230 on a Wednesday, not busy at all. 3/5."}
{"text":"Very good! I will try their fried tofu and Vegetables next time, if all good, I will also order party trays :)"}
{"text":"i been craving for sushi burrito and we found this place . its really good and staffs are friendly."}
{"text":"DIY is dangerously close to my office and we eat here at least once a week.  The food is always fresh and it has absolutely swayed the way that I judge other Poke places."}
{"text":"I was on this side of town for a doctor's appointment. Had 2 hours to kill before my next appointment so I stopped in here for lunch.   Had the Zen Bowl with brown rice. It was delicious. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"New spot in the Smiths plaza where tropical smoothie and Stephanos is at. Did a to-go order here, the place was nice and clean. The staff was nice and helpful. I made my own poke bowl, did a large size which includes 3 proteins. I got shrimp tempura, ahi tuna and salmon. Loaded it with the toppings and the DIY sauce they have is good!  The fish tasted fresh, although for a large I did wish they added more fish, felt like I was just eating the rice and proteins. And the shrimp tempura was either over cooked, or left out because it was not crunchy and did not have that fresh out the mini oven or dryer taste.  Overall, a good place to try, will definitely come back to try their sushi burritos."}
{"text":"There are a lot of poke places opening up and here's another one. This one doesn't stand out...the only thing that stands out is their spelling of \"poke\"... \"poki\"? Am I the only one bothered by this?  I understand they JUST opened, but the staff didn't seem confident in what they knew about the orders. I got the Zen \"Poki\" Bowl without lettuce, add surimi crab. I'm never sure about any sauces so I just picked what sounded familiar: spicy mayo LOL.   The bowl was good, but it didn't stand out to me. I've definitely had better poke bowls. This wouldn't be my first choice; the only reason why I tried it was because my coworker had a \"30% off entire purchase\" type of coupon. So why not?"}
{"text":"We found this place out of luck which I'm super happy about. They have so many options and everyone in there is so friendly. It's our new go to place for lunch now!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service! Loved the atmosphere and the cleanliness of the restaurant. Good quality fish and overall great experience. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and really like it! They have a number of different options and it's fully customizable. I have gotten the regular poke bowls both times and it has been the perfect amount of food and the price is decent too! If you have a military or student Id you get 10% off which is awesome. They also do sushiritos as well but I haven't tried that. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Easy, quick, and delicious. If I'm ever craving sushi DIY is my go to for a quick healthy bite! It's reasonably priced and plenty of space for diners. The yellowtail collar is perfect if you want something light. It take 15 mins to make so call ahead."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fresh poke bowls. The staff is always friendly. Food is delicious and yummy."}
{"text":"came in here for the first time and honestly it was not good I order the Poki salad with ahi tuna and shrimp first off the tuna was really disgustingly fishy and smelled bad it made me a little gross out because fresh fish it's not supposed to be fishy I wouldn't recommend this place but I'm glad I tried it out"}
{"text":"i saw this place close to work and decided to give a try! its so yummy, i had a burrito and it was delicious. im definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I tried DIY Poki Bowl for the first time while out running errands on my lunch break. The place is very spacious and upon walking in, staff greeted me. The staff here was great. Definitely 4-5 stars for staff.   So why the 3 stars? In comparison to other Poke Bowl/Burrito places around the area, this one is my least favorite. The fish is fresh, but my issue came down to the veggies/toppings. You know how some vegetables just don't keep well once cut? I suspect that's my issue. The tomatoes & cucumbers just didn't taste fresh. Portion size was great - I got a regular size bowl with rice, ahi tuna, and a variety of toppings (veggies, sauce). The sauce was another thing - I got a garlicy sauce that was ok but honestly too sweet to go with tuna, even though the server had recommended it. Meh.   Pricing wise, it seems pretty on par with their competitors in the area. Offerings are pretty similar too...create your own sushi burrito, bowl or salad. This place is really just \"meh\" at best, though."}
{"text":"loved their poke. was surprised that it was empty the day i went in. everyone is really nice and helpful. fish and everything else was good quality"}
{"text":"I got the vegas wrap and my boyfriend got the flaming dragon wrap. Both delish! And they have gluten free soy sauce !"}
{"text":"Always delicious with the end result!!  (Kinda pricey since my sushi burrito requests for xtra items always adds up to being a $16+ sushi burrito)!   Be cautious with the eel- it's pretty boney so I had to stop ordering eel w/my sushi. This is a bummer for me since I like eel.( Plus one time I had a bone caught inside my throat after eating the eel). Its really annoying !  Overall this place is kept clean, looks modern, the atmosphere is spacious, and I would say service is friendly & the quality of food I've ordered have always been consistent.  Thank you !"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, ordered from yelp! They have a simple selection of course you have your already made options with a diverse menu! And how could you not have a place where you can build your own!   I built my own, I had 3 proteins, ah√≠ tuna (which wasn't mashed up, which I love the cubed fish), salmon and crab meat! I enjoyed the freshness and the abundance of the raw fish. I also added a few veggies which I love how they have the cucumbers made into sticks, not whole. And of course I had my dipping sauces, super good! I love how it's wrapped, it's super tight and doesn't get messy, most places are always in a rush. This burrito is slightly smaller than most but packed with a bunch of yummy goodness.  I had also ordered 2 of their mango \"smoothies\", more like an ice slush but delicious! I would've taken a photo but I ate it all!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. After my daughter's doctor's appointment we were hungry and it was still early.. we drove up and down Eastern and came across this place. They were still closed but we were able to sit inside and wait.. it was also raining so it was nice to be able to wait inside instead of waiting in the car.   Food was great, I can't remember what I ordered but it was delish. They also have kids menu which is great and also a good size portion."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight, and yaaaaaaaaas!!! We are on this magical unicorn of sushi-burrito madness! Next stop, food coma!"}
{"text":"I just had the Sushi Burrito with all Ahi Tuna and Tempura Shrimp along with lettuce and house Poki sauce. I spend part of my year in Hawaii eating Poki wraps and I have to say this is very comparable if not even better than some of the pokerap wraps I've had on the island of Kauai. Can't wait to go back and have another!"}
