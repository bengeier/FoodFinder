{"text":"Having tasted chinese food all over char lotte i must say this is the best. Tony is a joy to talk to. That is when he slows down. If you have never had their chow, you are missing a great meal."}
{"text":"Best Chinese around. My family and I have been going for at least 10+ years, and it has always been our favorite. It is still my favorite take out Chinese food even though I live half way across the country. I always insist on getting Chen Fu when I come home for visits :). Generous portions, excellent service, and delicious food.  The family that owns the restaurant is always so friendly and willing to make any changes we request for dietary needs.  I recommend: Chicken with broccoli (I always request the white meat version) Sesame Chicken Chicken with mixed veggies All the sweet and sour combinations Egg Drop soup (very very good) Veggie egg rolls (yes, they have vegetable EGG ROLLS upon request as well as spring rolls--they also have pork egg rolls) Fried wontons (crab rangoons)-  these I crave the most, you can't find them like this anywhere else.  The fried rice is also delicious--not overly greasy like other places.  I highly recommend Chen Fu!   Now, go get some!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good and the portion was huge! The lady that helped me choose was really friendly and wanted to know if the food is good.  I think I would come back if I'm in the area..."}
{"text":"Chen Fu Fast Chinese Restaurant has to have the Best Tasting Oriental Cuisine in the area. They never miss a beat. Their food is always consistently the same. Even on a stormy day, their food tastes the same, as all their other days. I've been coming here, for a number of years and have come to love and respect the Chen Family. Tony (Dad), Sokha (Mom), Connie (Daughter #1), Brianna (Daughter #2) and Summer (Daughter #3) If you've never been at Chen Fu's and wish to give them a try, you'll most definitely be in for a treat. They make the Best Tasting Hot Wings. Also, try the Garry Special. Tony makes it for me, even though it's not on their menu. It's made up of beef  and chicken, with whatever fresh green vegetables he has, from his personal garden, at home. Most days he includes asparagus. Nonetheless, all the food is great. You couldn't spend your money at a better and more deserving family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and the fact that they have a fountain drink dispenser is nice. The only problem is that you only get plain white rice or plain fried rice with your meal. There is no option to switch it out with house fried rice or lo-mien for a couple extra bucks. Which is kind of odd because even small chinese places in food courts will give different sides. BUT the fried rice is a lot tastier than food court chinese."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food in Matthews.  I've been coming here for close to a year now whenever I work at home and need a quick Chinese fix. There are three restaurants that are always great - here, Best Wok II, and Best Wok (at Sardis Rd).  This restaurant is a little dingy inside. Never dirty, but very dated. The service is always very helpful, and attentive to your needs and preferences. After five or so orders here, they had my usual down pat, and knew when I called what to have ready for me. They've given me drinks for free on occasion just to say thanks, and have had me try \"off-the-menu\" items before, too.  The food is also very good. The sesame chicken (my standard by which I measure all Chinese takeout places) is awesome. The chicken is always tender, and the sauce is sweet with just a kick of spicy - just the way I like it. They aren't liberal with the sesame seeds (a plus), and the broccoli is very fresh.  The eggrolls taste different than any I've had before. They aren't the usual crunchy, chicken/shrimp-filled rolls most other places serve. They have what appears to be red cabbage in them, and the treatment is heavenly. It tastes almost herby rather than meaty, and they are not as crunchy, but fried to perfection. Fantastic egg rolls.  Prices are very reasonable, it's easy to eat lunch for $5-7, and dinner for $8-10. My wife and I order from here frequently and never pay more than $20 for two people."}
{"text":"Chen-Fu has excellent garlic sauce- perfect for broccoli or chicken. I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese food but when my husband wants Chinese, this is where I enjoy going with him. The crab rangoon is especially tastey if you're in a need-lots-of-fat mood. They do have \"diet food\" available on their menu (\"plain steamed meat and vegetables on our entrees with or without sauce\"). The staff is very friendly- they make it fun to be regulars. This is another great place for families- smoke-free!  Mon- Thurs: 11am- 9:30pm Fri: 11am- 10pm Sat: 12pm- 10pm Sun: 12pm- 9pm"}
{"text":"The food was good.  Different from others around for simple Chinese fare.  What impressed me was the service.  For a 'fast food' it couldn't have been better.  Brought food to table,  frequent checks on satisfaction,  refilled our drinks,  assisted our disabled father to restroom.  Just a great job all around.  Thank you"}
{"text":"SOOOO yummy! The food is the best we have found in Charlotte.  If you have an extra 10 minutes, let them make you Egg Foo Yung to order. It is so good and the sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"Best beef and broccoli ever. No matter how long it's been since I've been here (moved out of state but still go back when visiting family) they remember me!  That is a true testament of them caring about their guests. The owner is so kind. She really takes great care of the patrons dining in their small establishment. I wish they had coke but that's the only drawback!"}
{"text":"I tried Chen Fu based on its (relatively) high ratings and for its close proximity to my home in Matthews.  I called in a take-out order of sesame chicken (one of my favorites).  Their prices were just a tad higher that the Chinen restaurasnts we have in the Union County part of Matthews, but this place was worth trying given it's 3.5 star rating on Yelp.  When I arrived to pick it up, I could not help but to notice that their facility and dining area were seedy, unappealing and borderline dirty.  The women that took swiped my credit card and gave me my food was not at all friendly.  She was not mean per se, just not forthcoming.  Paying nearly $7 for my take-out lunch, I assumed she would at least be appreciative of my business; apparently not.  The food was neatly prepared in the Styrofoam tray and the servings were very generous (see my attached picture).  It was actually pretty decent, to my utter dismay given the visual appearance of the inside of their restaurant.  Two stars for the decent sesame chicken from the less-than-appealing Chinese hole-in-the-wall."}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight for take out--our first time as we're new to Charlotte. Such good food!  The hot and sour soup is amazing. Husband got the veggie lomein--full of veggies. So good and fast!"}
{"text":"I will be going back here, no doubt!  My take out was of General Chen's Chicken (spicy, I got an option, which I've never had before, is that an indication of freshness?), plain fried rice, and egg roll.  Every piece of chicken was juicy, no hard fried pieces here.  Egg roll was typical.  Rice, I do like it with some veggies and such in it, but I'm going to add a sauce of some sort, so I didn't really miss it, plus are those square cut carrots and peas fresh, no probably not, so is this also an indication of freshness.  Wait time wasn't long, I did walk in and order, sometimes it is good to slow down and breathe for a few minutes, but I looked at social media like everyone else this time.  As far as the appearance of the place, I've never walked into a fast Chinese food restaurant and been blown away with the decor, furnishings, etc unless it was in a new building, then I was shocked, but not impressed by my order.  If you're in the area, give it a try, I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, great food and great price. My favorite dish is general chicken!"}
{"text":"The owners are awesome! So friendly and nice . They can help you make a good pick for your meal. The food is fresh and takes it time to get out to the table. This is ensuring it's well cooked. A lot of stuff to choose from whether it's beef and broccoli or chicken with rice.    Check them out - I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Best chinese food!!! The owner and wife are so nice and always so friendly!! Do not pass up eating there! So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Love their special fried rice. Real authentic fried rice that is. Majority of fast food chinese restaurants would have the yellow color of rice, this one is brown and smell delicious!"}
{"text":"horrible food. ordered fried rice , it was brown rice .... came in a container with everything stuffed in and sauce leaking. shrimp were rubbery. all of this unfortunate food and it was over-priced. too many other places to choose from for good food and you are not getting ripped off !!"}
{"text":"I've been around a Chinese restaurant or two in my day...and let me tell you, here's one I'm actually willing to drive to (usually I insist on delivery). Their food is extremely fresh (cooked while you wait), portions are huge & it's not overly greasy.   They really had me at wonton. Their wonton soup was great, not the usual 1 lonely wonton in broth. So yummy!"}

{"text":"Most strip mall Chinese food is bland and boring, but at Chen Fu you get a pretty good variety at a great price.  In fact, their dinner combinations are so large that you can easily get a single order, and along with a couple of egg rolls, you have enough for two.  The food itself is tasty.  Not the best, perhaps, but well worth the effort, and for a smallish location tucked away in an otherwise nondescript location, quite a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need Chinese take-out. Nothing expensive, nothing flashy, just the standard box of rice, egg roll, and gallon of sweet and sour sauce.  Matthews has a couple options, but Chen-Fu is the only one still open at 8:30pm when my craving hit. The interior is very small, but the mirrored side wall helps give them impression of more space (and prevents claustrophobic anxiety attacks). They have the obligatory picture menu above the counter, near-life-size 3D artwork of the Great Wall, and the golden cat that perpetually waves you to the register. It's expected and comfortable.  The food is on-par with the genre, too. All the usual suspects are present and the flavors are fairly decent.  My fried rice was a little bland, but the main dishes were good. The huge servings and low prices help tip the scales in their favor. To be honest, there are better options in Matthews, but for a cheap fix that doesn't operate on unusual schedules, Chen-Fu is a neat place to check out."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Charlotte and found Chen-fu fast food in Matthews. The best fast food I've tasted across the States. I would recommend this place to Chinese food lovers because once you've tasted their sauces you're hooked."}
{"text":"Horrible food I ordered chicken with broccoli and white rice but got brown rice instead, ordered a large size and it was way to small! Too pricey for so little food! And it taste bad.. my stomach didn't agree with with there food.. do not recommend!"}
{"text":"We love Chen Fu! Everything is good and the owner is very friendly. They always make sure that you're well taken care of. I love their fried wings and Lomien and wanton soup. My husband's all time favorite is the chicken and broccoli. The rest of the food is great too! And they will cook it the way you want it (just don't forget to request!)"}
{"text":"Food was good not the best. The fried rice was Chinese fried rice no egg peas carrots or onions. It took 20 mins for my food but it advertised as fast Chinese.... I had better and worse"}
{"text":"Stopped in last Friday to get take out.  I was craving some lo-mein so I ordered vegetable lo-mein to go and it was ready in 5min.  Talk about fast service.  The cashier was very friendly and even knew what I was asking for when I started motioning my fingers like I was holding chopsticks.  Not sure how long this location has been open, but the space seems a little old, but it looks like the owners are doing their best with what they got.  I got the regular portion and it was good for 2 meals!"}
