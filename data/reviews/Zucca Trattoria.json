{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in the Yonge and Eglinton neighbourhood and decided to go for a stroll to find a new restaurant. We stumbled upon Zucca and decided to go in. 

The hostess was super friendly and asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't. Instead of being met with pretentious attitude, she quickly reassured us it was okay and led us to a nice table.

The server was brilliant and was able to describe all the dinner features to us inside out and backwards. And trust me there was a lot! We found out everything was made in house, including the pasta of course. 

We will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I remember eating pasta here... fettuccine alfredo sauce pasta. Some chicken I had, forgot what. Now that I've signed up on yelp, and reading all these detail oriented reviews, I'm feeling the pressure to actually start remembering what I ate at all these restaurants I go to. From now on, I will be taking mental notes and taking pictures, mentally and figuratively. All I know is the place is fancy, and classy. I like to go to restaurants not just for food but for the whole experience that comes with settings, and services, almost like visiting new countries and places. When I enter this place, it just sinks in, food seemed almost secondary, but I will definitely be coming back here again, and really start eating, because from my recollection, it was impressive. Not much of a review on food really, but yes, just try it."}
{"text":"We had a dinner here few weeks ago. From appetizers to dessert, everything was delicious! A little on a pricey side but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Sadly I have to downgrade them, although their fresh grilled whole fish is still good (yet more expensive than before), the service has lost its excellency. I've been here numerous times before tonight and had a fantastic time, tonight I felt like we weren't taken as seriously. We ordered cheese to close the meal and the pieces we got were offensive! We were a party of four and the one piece of cheese would not have been enough for even one person. Come on?!  What is worse when we asked for a bit more we were brought a second similarly small piece and then charged full price for two pieces. We also communicated to the restaurant that we were celebrating a 30th birthday; however this was overlooked by the staff. Overall a sadly disappointing experience from a usually fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a large party of 10. Service was great, food was delicious.  I was concerned we didnt have enough time to eat considering we had a late reservation but they never rushed us through dinner and we stayed well past closing time. Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Below is my rating definition.

* = Don't even bother going
** = Nothing out of the ordinary
*** = Pretty good stuff
**** = Outstanding
***** = It's basically 4 stars but they do it consistently

Am I demanding or people are being generous with their rating...everyone seems to give 4 or 5 stars? Don't get me wrong. They do the fish very well (and perhaps pasta), but aside from that, it's nothing out of the ordinary. 

Overall: stay with the menu's strengths (fish and perhaps pasta) and you'll have a delightful meal. Navigate away and you might never find yourself at Zucca again

{"text":"This place is literally as good as it gets in this area. Amazing, top notch professional service, fabulous and interesting food, and great atmosphere. Just the best!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant in fact my husband and I go here so often because its a sure thing.  I am really surprised at some reviews, I guess not everyone knows what tastes good.  I love that the food is organic and home made, and soo fresh.  As for the portions, they are perfect. No one wants to go out to a restaurant leaving like they will explode, you want to feel like you could have more.    Big portions is for chain restaurants not fine dining.  The atmosphere is great too. Also price is very fair.  You pay for the quality and service you get.  I am also happy to say it is one of the few restaurants I feel safe to eat in , they handle allergies with care."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant, comfortable and relatively quiet.

The food is good but the waiter keep filling our glasses with bottled water and my wife became suspicious and asked if the water was free and we were told it was $7 a bottle, we were on our 3 bottle and dinner had not started!

I would suggest the pasta, it is fresh and the Sauce was good.  I had the rabbit which I would not recommend, it was ok but nothing about it stood out and mad me think I would come back for this dish.

Best part is you can brink your own wine, as a collect that is very important to me and because if that and the pasta, I will go back!"}
{"text":"Dinner 
Food: 4-4.5/5 
Ambiance: 4/5 

Service: 3/5  
Service is where this place misses the mark. While friendly overall, the owner was unwilling to make a simple accommodation at the request of one of our dining companions who asked if potatoes could be omitted out of an octopus dish. Our dining companion could have just not eaten her potatoes, but it was a simple request. While the owner was otherwise friendly, his response and tone to our dining companion created an awkward moment for us.  Next it took well over an hour to hour and a half to be served our mains. Given that we had a reservation and we went straight to mains, and still had to wait this long was very surprising. 

Value: 3.5-3.75/5 

Repeat: Yes. Only because food is good to great, it is close by, has survived the test of time and I know a few ppl who I trust who swear by this place. So have to give this another try to see if the spotty service is a one off."}
{"text":"Food was great, which is why I will give it two stars. The service on the other hand was terrible. The head waiter came by while I was still eating with the bill and rudely informed us that there was a two hour limit and that we had to leave. He told us others were waiting patiently. When I made the reservations and when I arrived, no one informed us we only had two hours. Shame!"}
{"text":"I always look forward to dinner at Zucca. The food is delicious, and the staff are constantly looking after you. They do a great job with seafood, but the steak is also a terrific choice. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We came here after  watching a movie. Since this was a planned outing we thankfully made a reservation at this spot. The place was packed for Tuesday and I didn't see any empty tables. 
I had a chance to explore the menu beforehand and found it to be traditional. The Prix Fixe caught my eye as it is 28$ for a 3 course (salad, choice of pasta and dessert)  
We were served with a free starter of nicely spiced olives (black one's packed a punch)  stuffed foccacia and bread. The foccacia was very good. 
We decided on the mains and placed our order. I had a glass of La Fortuna which went well with my main. 
Here is the verdict
fall leaf salad, fresh herbs, sweet onion, red wine vinegar, extra virgin olive oil. An OK salad thankfully the dressing was simple and not overwhelming. I am not a salad eater by any means but my fellow diners enjoyed it. 
thick-cut semolina noodles with tomato, basil, fresh peperoncino,  extra virgin olive oil. I didn't try this dish, the person who ordered was happy with it. 
artisanal dry pasta with sicilian sauce of wild white shrimp, romanesco broccoli, raisins, capers, pinenuts, tomato . I did try this and found the shrimps to cooked well. The sauce went well with the protien. 
wide egg noodles with ragu of rabbit, white wine, tomato, green olives. This was my main. The pasta tasted very fresh. The rabbit meat had a very delicate taste which benefited from a change of taste with whole olives in between. A good take on ragu, nice balanced finish.
amaretto creme caramel. Decent
torta caprese. Didn't try
affogato di caffe. Wafer was super sweet and had nice layer of nuts. 
Decent desserts.
I also saw the way they serve fish which makes me want to come back just to try it out. Folks a whole grilled fish is brought table side and then de-boned by dedicated staff under purpose placed LED lamp.  This is a dying art in serving for western cuisine and I appreciate the effort that is on display here. 
Service was top notch and even though the place was packed we were checked on every now and then. High praise here for such a dedicated well trained staff.
This is a traditional take on Italian cuisine and IMHO this cuisine benefit from this approach. 
This place is by no means an inexpensive eatery but with the amazing value on the Prix Fix deserves a visit. 
4 Stars."}
{"text":"The pasta and fish at Zucca is incredible. Pasta melts in your mouth and fish is extremely fresh. I love their daily specials - creative, but still authentic. Staff are very attentive and service is quick and accurate. I go back all the time. Reservations are required, so don't forget to reserve at least a week in advance."}
{"text":"This is still a classy restaurant.

If it is likely to be busy, ask for a \"quiet table\" if you need to hear your full conversation.

The service is attentive, very well-informed, and flexible.

The wine list is pretty much exclusively Italian and not overpriced. However, corkage is $35 per bottle if you bring in your own.

We had the octopus starter, which was excellent, tender, with big smoky chunks.
The Pappadelle with Muscovy duck had a good taste of duck, which is so often not the case, and the pasta was perfect, just slightly al dente.
We had the whole fish grilled which was great. In our case it was the Porgy. The only drawback was, that they brought it to the table once they had cooked it to show you, then went back to the kitchen to debone it and by the time it actually arrived at the table to eat, it was rather cold. The stuffed red pepper that came with it was excellent; hot, herby, with rice.
The Cornish hen was fine, nothing exceptional. The dressing was lovely, the potatoes in duck fat were indifferent.

They bought a sweet complementary digestif, which was not really necessary, but for some will be a nice touch."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now. Their fresh pastas and desserts are delicious. I rarely deviate from my preferred dishes: the ravioli stuffed with beet and smoked ricotta in poppyseed butter sauce (small complaint: you never get enough -- maybe six ravioli total), and the creme caramel. The affogato and chocolate torta are both very good too. This is not a budget meal and the pasta portions tend to be small, but the food and service are excellent. The host is extremely affable and will remember you when you return."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Zucca! Warm, homey, confident, packed to the brim on a Wednesday night.

We started off with a bottle of white and some very tasty triangles of chickpea bread with rosemary. I was thankful to have had those when the actual bread baskets arrived shortly after, filled with bread so hard and dry that Moses would have politely passed on it. Balsamic might have helped, but being very authentic, we had to settle with EVOO.

The gnocchi (wild leek & ricotta, San Marzano tomato puree, toasted pinenuts, $18) was a surprise - not the pile of little thick, soft, doughy nuggets that I was hoping to see and share, but three extremely light poufs of ricotta. Oh well, room for dessert.

After a century, the rest of our food came out. Our party ordered several iterations of the pesce alla griglia (daily selection of whole fish grilled with herbs, market price - our visit offered sea bream, branzino, and some others I can't remember). Accompanied with a miniature side of negligible roasted potatoes and scant bitter greens, the fish itself was delicious and cooked simply, going perfectly with our wine. \"De-boned\" turned out to be still pretty boneful, so we chewed carefully.

Gelato ($10) was DELIZIOSO. We chose vanilla bean, dark chocolate and passionfruit and scraped up every last bit."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm not a huge fan of eating at Italian spots - $25 for pasta better be really, really, impressive. So, take that as you will.

I've passed this place a million times, and after finally checking the menu, decided to give it a shot. I started with the octopus, which was really good. The wife had  the soup of the day, which was pretty good as well. For my main course I had the duck, which was pretty underwhelming and way over cooked. The wife's pasta (special of the day) was equally underwhelming.

Service was good, and they tried to make good on the over cooked duck, but half way into the meal I'm not really into waiting for another piece of duck.

Overall, a nice spot as far as ambience goes, and I'd be willing to give it another shot to try something else on the menu, probably a whole fish."}
{"text":"Zucca has a powerful duo in its kitchen and front of house as both are manned by talented and experienced professionals which results in a enjoyable midtown dining experience. My dining buddy Christine C and I ventured outside of our usual eating perimeters one night to dine here and it didn't disappoint. This is a lovely and warm trattoria serving creative and contemporary Italian fare. It's also filed with midtown regulars which is another good sign.

Once seated we were greeted by the gracious and knowledgeable owner Blair, who gave us a brief run-down of the seasonal menu and the nightly specials. Blair is the consummate host, he offered polished, warm service and never missed a beat in topping up our wine and water. The kitchen sent off farinata as the amuse bouche, little chickpea crepes with olives and rosemary. These were gobbled up quickly they were mouthwatering!

We started off our meal with the daily soup to share-a porcini barley soup ladled over a dried wholewheat bagel. Very hearty and rustic, with satisfying flavours. For a pasta and main, we chose to split a ziti and a walnut-crusted tenderloin. The ziti came adorned with a punchy caper tomato sauce with eggplant and topped with some toasted breadcrumbs. The sauce was the highlight as it was lush and complex but the pasta was little off the mark being a tad al dente or chewy. Still pastas are one of the specialty's here, and I wouldn't hesitate to order pasta from here again as they have some interesting housemade creations from whole wheat to squid-ink. The main was a walnut crusted tenderloin which was expertly panfried and tender but suffered from underseasoning or a lack of sauce. We also appreciated that each of our dishes was split proportionately, what a nice touch.

3 and a half stars. Exemplary service and inventive italian cuisine. We had a few misses in our dishes but not enough to distract us from return visits."}
{"text":"Blair and his staff are attentive, warm and friendly. The food is delicious. Always have an outstanding meal here. I eat low carb and they had no problem meeting my dietary requirements. I particularly liked the beet salad. At Blair's  suggestion I had the fish which was scrumptious."}
{"text":"In our quest for a cheap and cheery Italian restaurant in the neighborhood, we found Zucca.  It's not cheap but it is cheery.  On a Monday night, only about 2 or 3 tables in the whole restaurant was empty.  We were greeted by Blair.  The organic Berkshire sausage and grilled octopus in a bed of cherry tomatoes was refreshing.  The Octopus dish is one you would die for on a hot summer day.
As for mains, the quail was neither disappointing nor  mind blowing.  I felt it was over powered by the marinate/sauce.  The quail was well cooked and very meaty.  Overall, the ambiance makes for a nice dinner with a significant other but also cozy and rustic enough to be in the company of good friends.  The service is delightful and everyone that you interact with at the restaurant has a great disposition."}
{"text":"Why is there only 2 reviews for this place so far (three counting mine)!? This is by far the best Italian restaurant I have ever eaten at. It is authentic Italian made with fresh quality ingredients, go NOW!"}
{"text":"The two highlights of our meal were the Chickpea Flour bread (recipe available on the Zucca website) and the whole fish (Sea Bream for us). 

We opened with the Ricotta Gnocchi which was tasty, albeit not the filling bowl of potato dumplings I was expecting. The fish, as mentioned, was excellent and flavourful. As there were a lot of bones left in the fish (and it took quite awhile to leave it that way) I would recommend not requesting their de-boning.

I also had an opportunity to try their homemade Tonnarelli egg noodles, which were fantastic! Absolutely perfectly cooked...if you had a 3D dictionary you could take a bite out of, they'd be the description under \"Al Dente\"."}
{"text":"3 of us shared Shaved Branzino, Ink Squid Pasta & Ravioli.  Branzino was the best out of the 3 dishes.  Ravioli unfortunately was undercooked.  Service was decent."}
{"text":"Your poop smells too Zucca. 20+ years of fleecing people doesn't make you a good restaurant. You are why people don't trust restaurants. Giving dishes unpronounceable names doesn't make you cool. It makes you douche bags. How I wish the locals would wake up to your pretentious noise and say Wait a minute ! that was basic food at super stupid prices !"}
{"text":"I have nothing great to say about this place except to review Grano instead.

Grano was a great restaurant that has a great Italian feel. The food was quite pleasantly good and our server was very nice. Plenty of seats and a great place to improvisingly take a group of 10 when your reservations gets cancelled  and even Opentable fails you in sending an email about a cancellation from an overrated Italian restaurant. Grano was a place that was referred to me by the seemingly overrated decor that is Zucca where while waiting for our \"table\" at Grano, we were waiting in line outside the clipart Zucca signage that aligns well with their stark decor. Zucca was great at directing the people who were expecting to come dine at Zucca, be directed eventually towards Grano. So I advise Grano to thank Zucca for the business."}
{"text":"Gosh...I'm the first person to write a review about this place??

I'm shocked and need to spread the word that this is the best Italian in Toronto. Forget Mistura and all your other high end restos.

Authentic, simple quality ingredients. Anti pasto platter and grilled fish. Superb service and great value. Just like in Rome.

Again....you want Italian, go here!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, very authentic Italian.  Great service, nice atmosphere. Great place for dates. I had the pasta with ragu, it was incredible!"}
{"text":"A very good dinner. Fine beet salad, vy good Cornish hen, and a lovely dessert. Not inexpensive but worth it. The only problem--noise, so loud that you either shout or go silent."}
{"text":"3 & 1/2 stars 

The biggest asset that Zucca Trattoria has going for it is its owners, Host Blair Aspirall and Chef Andrew Milne-Allan. It is obvious that they have a real love and appreciation for authentic and well made Italian cuisine. It is also obvious that they value the relationship that they have with their customers. The care, affection and genuine affinity they show for their business is on par with one of my most fav T.O. resto spots, Silver Spoon. These guys, like at the SS, don't just hand you a menu, it's almost like they want you to read in between the lines of the menu. As an informed diner/foodie I appreciate that effort. 

Deanna and I went north of our usual dining haunts to check out Zucca and it was worth the effort. We started with the soup of the day, a Porcini Mushroom & Barley soup that is poured over a dried wholewheat bagel styled ring of bread. It was delicious. Hearty, Warm. Filling. Everything home made soup should be. Dea and I opted to share a pasta course and settled for Ziti in a sauce that was sweet but with an edge of arrabiata to it. There was ground sausage and fried breadcrumbs mixed in with the tomato sauce. I could have passed on the pasta and eaten a plate of the sauce with a piece of bread on its own. The pasta was far too el dente for my tummy. I don't mind el dente to a degree but there is a fine line and this was really the shortcoming of this dish. 

For our main we shared a pork tenderloin that was fileted and crusted with walnuts. It was good but in my opinion the meat needed either more seasoning or some sort of sauce. It was slightly bland and a little bit dry on it's own but we still did enjoy it. To me, pork, much like chicken, needs a decent amount of herbs and some TLC to bring out its best qualities. 

The wine list at Zucca is great. We quaffed back a light northern Italian red from Castello Di Verduno (that would be Barbaresco/Barolo country) and it was perfect for our meal. 

In all fairness to Zucca, the house specialities are their fresh pasta and the fish dishes, neither of which we tried. In a heartbeat I'd go back to Zucca. The ambiance, the service and the amuse buse of that delicious chick pea fritatta/bread is worth it. The people next to us had a whole fish dish and it looked awesome. I should have listened to Blair when he recommended the fish. I'm such a carnivore. I'll be back though to make up for it."}
{"text":"Small menu but you can tell that each item is cooked really well. It's always better when restaurants focus on quality over quantity and Zucca does that very well. The wine selection is also smaller and focuses on the Italian wines so you won't find your Malbec's or Bordeaux's. There are some riojas but we opted for a Toscana which was very smooth. 

Everyone ended up choosing items on their daily special so we didn't get to try most of the items on the regular menu. I did get the octopus appetizer which was decent. The octopus was a tad overcooked but mixed with a lemon sauce, it was still pleasant for my taste buds. My parents ordered the branzino and a tortellini to share which was probably a bit too much. By the time everything was all eaten, we were too stuffed for dessert. 

I can definitely see myself coming back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant really was a tale of two meals for my guest and I.

We arrived early on a Sunday night with no reservation; no problem, we were seated immediately with a friendly greeting.  The service was friendly, accurate, and attentive - total pluses, deserving of more stars than shown in the review above.  The staff knew the food, knew the specials, and were ready to go.  Professional, and impressive.

However, my guest and I only ordered a single course, and it took the kitchen more than 40 minutes to get it to us - which, considering the number of tables seated when we ordered, seemed out of line.  Odd.  Good food is worth the wait, but it didn't seem fair that other tables received course after course before we saw our own meal.

To the food: I had the special, which was a butternut squash-stuffed ravioli in a sage butter sauce.  It was fresh, well-prepared, appropriately portioned, and delicious.  I have no complaints.  Well done.  I'd have it again in a heartbeat.  However, my guest ordered the steak - which, while it was prepared to order, came out bland and unseasoned.  For something that was among the most expensive things on the menu, we expected better.

Presentation of the food was well done - not spectacular, but definitely professional.

All in all, this is a good place to go, and I'd venture there again - just don't order the steak.  And if you're going during prime time, make a reservation."}
{"text":"Yup, there's a 5-star Italian resto on Yonge south of Eg...

Intimate and refined...these were my first impressions. But my lasting impression was the food. In two words, molto bene. True it's not cheap, but from the grilled octopus to the burrata with prosciutto, grilled whole fish (filleted in the kitchen, on request) and beautiful homemade pasta, it was truly bellisima.

The experience was further elevated by some of the best service we've experienced in a long time (and we dine out a LOT). Truly first class."}

Quick Review: OK food, not so OK prices.

Am I the only one that does not think this place is amazing? I'm not sure if it was just me, but i found the menu to be too eclectic for my liking.  I guess I'm just not a fancy restaurant kind of guy.

I found the portions small, and the prices too high to justify.  Maybe its the \"we try to use local and organic\" spiel.  I'm not into organic.  I'm into local because it should be tastier, fresher, and sometimes cheaper.

I'm not so into the service either.

diner 1: I'll have the prix fixe ....
diner 2: I'll have the prix fixe ....
diner 3: I'll have the prix fixe ....
diner 4: I'll have the pork tenderloin ....
diner 5: I'll have the prix fixe ....
waitress: wait, if none of you order the super fresh grilled fish [that I already told you about 3 times already] it would be tragic. let me get it and show it to you.
waitress: look how beautiful this fish is. and we grill it [on a magical grill that makes it taste better than any fish you will ever eat in your whole life]
diner 6: OK, i'll have the fish 
diner 5: OK, i'll have the fish also
diner 4: I want the fish too, but can i have it with a simple tomato sauce on it?
waitress: well, what i would suggest is you get the fish grilled, and then order a small portion of the plain pasta. so you can have your fish and your sauce.
diner 4: but i don't want pasta
waitress: WELL, we can't just INVENT a new dish just for you SIR.
diner 4: ok, I'll just have pork tenderloin

How is putting a simple tomato sauce (presumably the same spaghetti sauce that goes onto the pasta) onto some grilled fish inventing a new dish? If that is invention, I have a boat load of inventions to sell you ma'am.


Would i go back here?
Only if its on someone else's dime."}
{"text":"Zucca isn't my favourite spot in our new neighbourhood, but it's pretty darn good. The food was good and the service was excellent. My mother-in-law forgot her reading glasses and the server (believe it or not) had a box of options ready for her. It was very sweet and funny. It also wasn't overly noisy. Definitely a safe place to take your parents or grandparents :)"}
{"text":"Although I haven't been to all Italian restaurants in town, this one is one of my favourite and I think one of the best! 

Everything on the menu and off the menu is delicious. So delicious that you forget to take pictures of your meal...
They change up their menu occasionally so you never get bored eating here."}
{"text":"Best home made pastas this side of Italy.   And the unique soups they've been experimenting with have been incredible.   Best pasta in the city and one of my favorite restaurants period."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all ! Ordered the seafood pasta. Small portion of pasta with cold and rubbery seafood for $26 ! Very pricey, food was less than nothing special. Will not return...too many other fantastic restaurants in Toronto !"}
{"text":"Always amazing quality food. As a Celiac I feel safe eating here, lots of good selection!  The Farinata, given as a free starter, is gluten-free and addictive. A real great place for a nice night out."}
{"text":"I stand corrected: Zucca is the best authentic Italian in Toronto. With an unassuming street façade, it's demure to passers-by, but hard to leave once you're on the warm inside.

The chefs daughter is celiac, so they were very knowledable about gluten-free options. In fact, instead of bread and oil, we were served a chickpea- flour bread baked with rosemary--it was melt-in-your-mouth, and multiples better than the polenta it resembled.

Service was very articulate beyond just wheat-free suggestions. We tasted and learned about Gattinara wines, from vineyards in the Northwest of Italy, from the very owner! 

The server and owner both took time to sit with us at the table--they were brimming with hospitality and yet exuded authority with their suggestions. Our plates were served gracefully, deftly.

The meal:

We were offered a choice between a special tasting menu, a $25 prix fixe (salad, pasta & desert) and the full menu. I chose a la carte.

Along with the chick-pea cakes, the olives were the best I've ever had--spicy, sweet, black and wrinkly. I didn't even know that olives could even be improved upon!

 The Amore Negro wine was incredible--the bouquet, the smoothness--as was the Sangiovese.

I had trouble resisting the octopus salad, but settled on the white asparagus with hollandaise and white polenta! It was divine!!

My entrée was the branzino stuffed with rosemary and bay, served with olive oil that the fluffy meat just absorbs like magic, accompanied by stuffed artichokes and chard.

For desert, I split flourless chocolate cake with ricotta tart with a friend, but I must return for the meringue!

I can't believe how many times I walked past Zucca, perfectly situated just South of Y& Eg. All it took was a friend to make the recommendation--now we're hooked!"}
{"text":"I love my dining experience at Zucca Trattoria. 

I made my reservation through www.opentable.com for table for 4 on a Sunday evening at  8 pm. I was glad that I made a reservation because when we arrived at 8 pm all the tables was occupied. So make sure you make a reservation if you decide to dine here!

The interior was nicely decorated with vibrate colours. We were thinking about the $25 prix menu specials which they advertise on their website that includes salad/pasta/dessert. To our mismay we were informed that it is not available for March since they are doing the Stop For Food prix menu ($50 with $10 towards charity). My dining mates were little disappointed.... A lesson learned, don't believe the information on the outdated website, call to confirm!

Anyway, I settled on the Stop for Food prix menu and we ordered a main course each: troccoli al nero ai frutti di mare, gallinella al mattone. 

The Stop for Food prix menu is a 4 course menu which a number of choices which I decided on pear appetitizer, mussels on bread, lamb skewer and chocolate cake dessert.

The soup of the day ($9) is a mussel with beans soup. My dinner mate thought it was just ok.. I found it has too much beans inside and I am Not a bean person.

The black squid ink seafood pasta ($23) was great! The homemade noodles was so tasty and the seafood so freah! The only problem is it is too small :).

The cornish hen ($26) was so tender! So much favour and so juicy! 

I am not a lamb eater.. but the lamb that they serve here wase nicely marinated! Tender, Juicy..yummmm.... I found the side was a little strange.. I don't really eat dandelion... ok I did eat them all before I found out they were dandelion.

Our waitress was really attentative and answered all our questions about the menu. 

I wish I can come here more often... but it is kind of pricey with the portion served, so I have to save this for special occasions!

BTW, I think I will try one of their Catch of the Day next time I come! I saw they grilled the whole fish fresh and show it to the table across from us then took that back to the kitchen to have it fileted! 

You can found free parking at the side streets just across the road."}
{"text":"Been to Zucca several times and have always left happy. The food is great, but the service is absolutely exceptional."}
{"text":"Service was fine for our 6 pm reservation but when the restaurant was full, it was not. It was likely that the kitchen couldn't meet the demand. Others in our party thought the server forgot our dessert. We left without dessert. There is also nothing on the menu for children. But the greatest issue we had was the price. We are a family of world travelers and have eaten at very high end restaurants so we don't mind paying for quality. The portions are very small and the quality is average for a very expensive meal."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurant in town. I walked pass by there so many times but never thought about trying until my friend recommended it.  I ordered the squid ink seafood pasta and it was the first time I tried squid ink pasta;  now one week after I am still thinking how great the pasta was and can't wait to go back to try it again!! I heard the pasta are all handmade and maybe that's why it tasted so good. The portion was also big with lots of seafood.  
For dessert, I got the gelato in espresso..and it was also a wow:) 
I highly recommend to make a reservation before as it may get busy."}
