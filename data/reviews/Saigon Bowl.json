{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. Nice family restaurant. B4 is the best!!! It is an older place but the food is great!!"}
{"text":"This is mostly Vietnamese food but the also have some Chinese dishes as well. Its not fancy but great food. I have eaten here for 10 years. I love the Kung Pow chichen!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Fresh food at a great price! Only complaint is it is super light so usually will get hungry After couple hours haha but still really delicious and highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I personally love this place and drive from the far north valley to eat here.  Although, I have to say I've only ordered one thing: Hui Tiu Dai (sp?).     The rice noodles are always perfectly cooked and the flavors in the broth never fight each other.  So far it's the only place I've found with broth this good.    The place located in a small strip center and is very modest, but the staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Kim at Saigon Bowl serves the best Vietnamese food around Scottsdale. Suggest B1 with a order of spring rolls. I generally don't write reviews, but the food is outstanding and inexpensive. I don't think you will be disappointed .Just read where the County Health Department, gave Saigon Bowl the highest rating for clean dining."}
{"text":"So I came here because I was in the area studying. I got the pho tai chin. The broth was very bland. I had to \"doctor\" it a lot. It did come with a lot of meat and the price was decent. I also got an imperial roll (Vietnamese egg roll). It was also pretty bland. I am not super picky about my pho, but I definitely would not come back. There are far better places than this one!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho I've had anywhere. It's never not delicious. All of their appetizers are flavorful and super well priced. Try the spring rolls. They're perfect for sharing. We haven't branched out to their other entres but other customers have told us about how good they are. Also, they have amazing icecream. Just make sure to ask what flavors they have. The coffee is to doe for too."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place on a whim tonight, and I have to say that it is one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant. I have no idea how this place only has 4 stars. I checked the pictures, and it's the same place. Although, it has different chairs now.   The parking lot was full when we arrived, so we were hesitant, thinking the place would be packed. But, it was actually nearly empty. It had some nice music playing which made our date night even more enjoyable.  The servers were kind and on top of it. They took pride in their work, and our glasses never were less than half full. They made sure we were happy. It was awesome!   The food was amazing too. We tried two appetizers, the potstickers and the traditional spring rolls. The spring rolls were to die for. They had fresh herbs and the boyfriend (who hates shrimp) ate them happily. There was no fishy/shrimpy taste at all. We dipped them in the provided peanut sauce after mixing it with the chillis like the server suggested. The potstickers were fried fresh and the dough had a great texture. The sauce was a perfect spicy/sweet.   For our entrees we did the pho ga and the kung pao chicken. The broth was exceptionally flavorful, and i was hesitant to add any of the normal items to the soup. But, i slowly worked them in. The kung pao chicken was very fresh. They had a spicy and regular version. We liked it spicy and were glad they offered it.   I honestly can't get over how good it was. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not bad. But a restaurant that has been opened since 1988 I would expect better. Pho was ok service was ok"}
{"text":"Great job guys with the food and service, support them it is a family owned and operated business and it shows!!"}
{"text":"I had P2 Pho It had an amazing broth. The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"I've only had the pho and spring rolls and they're both pretty good!  Can't complain.  Stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"Quaint little place. Wasn't so sure when we walked in, but didn't leave disappointed.  Our server was extremely friendly and our noodle soup was delicious. Would def go back again if I'm the area."}
{"text":"We were excited to think that we may have found a hidden gem in our neighborhood. We love pho! However,  we were dismayed when my fiance reacted terribly that evening to the apparent MSG that they use. Obviously, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious pho, good price, friendly service, clean place, cute decor.   Went to try the pho - I had the well done brisket pho - it was delicious & had all the fresh toppings on the side. My big bowl was $7.95 & I couldn't finish it all. The servers were all really nice. I saw a sign that said the place got an A+ from the dirty dining review. The decor appeared to be Ikea, so it didn't have an Asian vibe, but it was stylish & modern."}
{"text":"I've tried all the local Vietnamese spots in this area and this one will now be on my list of go-tos. Everyone was so friendly. We felt welcomed and taken care of the moment we entered. The restaurant itself is clean and newly remodeled. The food was delicious. We got the chicken potstickers, the traditional shrimp and pork spring rolls, and two different phos. Everything was steaming hot and fresh, and the ingredients were good quality. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food and service here are outstanding.  You can tell they use fresh high quality ingredients.  My favorite place to get a banh mi and vermicelli bowl."}
{"text":"The Chicken Pho was good, but not great.  My girlfriend had the beef and meatball Pho.  It was kind of bland and she had to add a bunch of salt.  Service was good up to the point of our waitress getting off for the day.  After that we did not get any service except for the bill. Still looking for a great Pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much on the outside or even on the inside for that matter.  Almost left the restaurant actually because we were scared of what was to come. Glad we stayed though! We both ordered pho...and it was sooo good!! Better than the other pho place I went to in this area. This is a small family owned restaurant and our waitress didn't speak much english, but she gave us great service! Will go back again."}
{"text":"Great little place that has really good Bun! Their Pho is also good, but the Bun is wonderful. At the office, we just send an e-mail with a subject line of \"B4\" (which is the Bun combo of shrimp, pork and imperial rolls) when we are hungry for good Vietnamese food.  Friendly folks serving good food - what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the pho tai and spring rolls w/ peanut sauce. Both dishes were excellent. The place itself is a bit drab, and based on my one visit, it's not the place to be on a Saturday evening save a few seniors citizens. This place needs some freshening up. The 5 star rating is for the food and for the fantastic service. The server was friendly, welcoming and energetic, and I couldn't help but smile when she came by my table. In conclusion food good, service great, vibe meh."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant I've found in the Phoenix area.  Went there about a week ago, after reading some reviews.  Went back there again today, as I my wife and I drove home from airport.  Ordered the same thing both times...Vermicelli bowl!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've lived down the street from here for two years and never stopped here! This place is a sweet and saucy little secret in a not so lively shopping center.  The space itself is very clean, bright, soft and feels good to be in. Nice pure smell in the air with great colors on the walls and plants!   Service was A+. Staff was very Personable, patient, informational and truly cared about my experience. The server even tossed my bowl for me! :) He was incredibly sweet and caring!  Food arrived quickly, very very fresh! Fresh ingredients and delicious! I got a bowl with noodles and veggies, nothing fancy but sooooo yummy.   I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Saigon bowl with a friend we both had wonderful meals the food is so fresh and tasty and there are so many things to try the service is excellent at the waiters pretty cute I like the changes they have made and the update they have done to this restaurant try the lemon chicken and the orange chicken my friend have the broccoli and beef combo the eggrolls were Chrisp  as well as the potstickers we will definitely return i"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant that I've ever been. I got recommended by a friend and since then I come here almost every week for lunch, trying different things every time and NEVER feel disappointed. The restaurant is pretty with modern decoration and clean. Excellent customer service for a good price of food. The staff are very attentive and nice to talk to. Their Pho is the best, authentic and flavorful. You can tell that they use fresh ingredients. Also, they have the best grilled pork sausages (nem nuong) spring rolls in town that I've never found in other Vietnamese restaurants. It comes with a very special delicious peanut sauce. Very tasty!!! Overall, If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would!!! They are deserved it."}
{"text":"Came to this place twice now since it's so close by. Everyone has been super nice there and the service is fast! More importantly the food is delicious :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a true treasure!  We came across it by accident and I can promise that I will return as often as possible.  The service was exemplary, the food was fresh, crisp, and beautifully presented, and the ambiance was unbelievably inviting.  The decor holds a modern twist and yet provides a feel of pure Asian culture, which has come to be expected in such an establishment.  Further, with myself being of vegan lifestyle and my adorable friend choosing his meal to have shrimp, I feel our analysis is well balanced.  It is easy to find something to suit every palate and I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.  It is spectacular!"}
{"text":"Really excellent family owned restaurant that deserves your business. Staff is always friendly and food is all house-made. Some of the best Vietnamese food in the valley ;)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It was delicious!!! I really enjoyed my dinner and the service was fantastic! I will be back asap! It's close to me and reasonable prices! Love!"}
{"text":"Very good Pho!  Reasonably priced.   Don't get intimated with the strip mall it's located in. The place is older but seems clean and I always get good Pho."}
{"text":"I've been there for the pho noodle soup twice already this week. Do yourself a favor and check Saigon Bowl out everything my friends and I have tried has been super delicious and fresh. The owners / management are very friendly, and aim to please."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is fresh, huge portions and very tasty! The staff is also very nice."}
{"text":"Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations after hearing about this place, but I was somewhat disappointed with the chicken pho. The service was wonderful, though, and my coworkers (for the most part) had great meals. I'll go back again and try something different next time, but I think for pho I'll stick with Noodles Ranch."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great find! Tucked away in a strip center but the food is so fresh and good! We had spring rolls and shrimp appetizers. Both very good. My husband had pho and a ban mi. I had item B3. I can't pronounce it but it was fabulous! Served with sweetened fish sauce that you drizzle or pour over it. Yum. Prices are great and service amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place over 5 times in the last 5 years. Every time, I hoped it might have gotten better. The food is decent at best for Chinese/Vietnamese food. The problem isn't the food though. The place is almost divey but I'm used to that.  The problem is that the food takes sooooo long to be served. Even if you order over the phone, they will tell you it should be 20-30 minutes. 20-30 minutes for a bowl of pho and a couple spring rolls at a non rush hour time? When you go to pick it up, you wait another 10-15 minutes. This has happened every time I ordered.  For Vietnamese food, and I've eaten at over 50 Vietnamese spots, this place is VERY slow. Especially for the quality.  I would only recommend if time and quality aren't an issue for you"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple, and straight to the point. BEST PHO RESTAURANT IN ALL OF ARIZONA. Great food, and great people working here."}
{"text":"My review is based on only 1 visit as was here from out of town. Got take out. Food was all very good. Very fresh. I got pho, spouse got bahn mi & we shared shrimp spring rolls. The spring rolls were some of the best we ever had. Service was friendly & prompt. Restaurant very clean. Food was packaged well for take out. Will definitely return on our next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I eat here almost on a weekly basis. The food is just as great whether you are dining in or taking out. (But I recommend dining in because the staff is SO friendly!)  They have a fresh take on Vietnamese, which is what I love about Saigon Bowl. The staff is wonderful and truly cares about your authentic experience if you aren't familiar with the cuisine. I've never had a bad meal here. The food typically comes out super fast, which is great for days when you're in a rush. Plus, I love that they have a few boba choices (taro is my fave) and some of the best Thai iced tea I've had in the states. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today BEST DECISION EVER! The food is amazing and super fresh broth from my phò was on point and my husband's meal was just as delish if not even better will be reccomending to all of my friends and family. Also the cleanliness is spot on as well we will be coming back and getting delivery through postmates I have found my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Best Phó for miles!  I crave this it's so good... you feel welcome as soon as you walk in.  We always get the soup to go, and it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"food was yummy, prices are reasonable, inside is clean and cute, and the service was exceptional! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and found the place very well decorated and clean. Had the Vietnamese Imperial Rolls and the Chicken Breast Pho. The rolls were delicious and was served with lettuce wrap, Thai basil, cilantro and a dipping sauce. Was a bit confused about the lettuce until the server suggested I wrap the roll in the lettuce with the basil and cilantro then dip. Boom! Was really good! The Pho was also amazing. Broth was so clear and flavorful with plenty of chicken and veggies. Great meal and will be going back."}
{"text":"this place is so good. It's like a hole-in-the-wall kinda place. The owners are new and they provide great services. I really like the spring rolls and the filet mignon. Most recommend!!!"}
{"text":"family owned restaurant with fair prices and great pho.  It is all about the broth.  A friend also ordered off the menu, chicken and rice Vietnamese style. It was excellent as well.  Simple yet clean decor.  I will be a regular.  Even the ice cubes were filtered."}
{"text":"I've had better pho and better thai iced tea, but it wasn't bad. I'd go there again. I wasn't too fond of their crab rangoon at all but their chicken pot stickers were really good. The service was exceptional. I brought a large family who was not into Asian food but they were really helpful and even provided toy chopsticks for the kids. They explained what everything was and how certain sauces would taste before us even asking. The staff was young and I guess that explained the music selection but I didn't mind it. Prices weren't bad - everything under $20."}
{"text":"Eh, it's okay. Food is cheap and you get what you pay for, so no problem on that front. I've had the cafe sua da/D4 cold, combination fried rice, and nem nuong/K1. Ownership changes must be true because the menu looks cleaned up even compared to pictures from this August.  The Vietnamese coffee was pretty on point - always better with condensed milk! The nem nuong was solid as well - good crunch and savoriness from the wontons and meat, and the sauce hit the right notes. Too bad about the fried rice though - the toppings are on point but it was pretty bland. I did end up trying some of my brother's pho broth, but It felt decent/average, not really wowed by it.  Single digit Viet food, even if mediocre, should have been a home run for me, but I was really bugged by the service, at times pushy and inconsistent. Weird, right? A lot of people here are heralding it.  If I order Vietnamese coffee in Vietnamese, I hoped that would imply I know what I'm doing. Literally the second my drip stopped, a waiter swooped in and asked me if I knew what I was doing. Before I could even respond, he took my cup and did pouring/stirring for me. Seriously, dude? That's part of the experience.  Also my friend ordered a separate coffee without condensed milk at the same time. We were engaged in conversation, but 40 minutes later it didn't come - turns out my separate order turned out to be a correction of his...? It took one of our late friends ordering a third coffee before they realized what happened.  I think given location and pricing this place is okay - maybe I'm just an off experience with service. When we were the only ones in the restaurant. I probably won't be back though - I literally had better AZ Viet food in a food court."}
{"text":"Food is very good all the time. I remember when it was 1 tiny store. Pho with meatballs (P7 no longer on menu but they will still make it for you.) and the salad rolls (K2) are my favorites."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place just doesn't stack up against other quality Vietnamese places around.  I ordered the 'Filet Mignon' pho to go. The packaging I must say was nice, with everything separated neatly and with care. Unfortunately, the flavors left a lot to be desired. I think that having the ingredients separated from the broth didn't lend itself well to the meal, since the flavors simply could not possibly permeate anything just by dumping it in.  The meat itself was pretty nasty and minuscule. It was soft and mushy, hardly what I'd call 'filet mignon'. I mean honestly, who would really think that could pass? And like I said, there was very little of it.  The broth was very bland with zero complexity. The noodles were chewy and the greens were still attached to the stem. Taking it off the stem might be a good idea for the future, just saying.   All in all, I was rather disappointed, sad to say. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"They have the best pho! It has a lot of meat. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This Pho is the tits. I got the Pho Rau Cai (deep fried tofu & assorted veggies) and it was hands down the most delicious bowl of Pho I've ever had. All of the ingredients are super fresh, the service was extremely fast considering it was their busy lunch hour and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"This small out-of-the-way restaurant has become my favorite. The food is fresh and well prepared and worth the drive coming from Scottsdale"}
{"text":"LOVE! The best Vietnamese restaurant in AZ for sure. The food is really special."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant ever! The Pho is great, and the Imperial rolls are amazing!! The customer service is excellent, and they are super friendly! The one waiter is super caring and kind! I love coming here and I'll definitely be coming back for more"}
{"text":"This is not the best Vietnamese restaurant, however it is good enough to fill you up.  Located in an almost empty \"shopping\" plaza, Saigon Bowl serves the traditional pho soups and many rice combination plates. I went during lunch time and got the spicy chicken with lemongrass. It was actually spicy and good. The price of the plate was only 5.75 since it was during lunch time. Fountain drinks are only $.99. Service was okay, not the best. Overall, I had a good meal. Probably will be back to try their pho. If you are not careful, you will drive right by it."}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall joint has some of the best pho i've ever tried, I will 1000% be back. The meat is tender and the broth has so much flavor. The spring rolls were really good too but not as cold as i would prefer. The atmosphere is underwhelming and it was completely empty when we were there, but multiple people stopped by to pick up to go orders. Not exactly an impressive place for a date night but the food is fantastic. The staff was so friendly and accommodating by far one of the best places for pho I've been to in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The service was AMAZING.  They make you feel like you're eating in a FIVE STARA restaurant.  The food was flavorful and awesome!!!  You MUST get here now."}
{"text":"First timer here and my experience was great! I saw positive reviews on yelp and decided to go try it out and i must say, this place is up to its hype! The staffs were extremely friendly and I got my food right away. I love this place! I would definitely recommend and i would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This family place has kept my fed for many lunches and dinners, since I live and work in the neighborhood.  Go for the B4 if you're feeling hungry!"}
{"text":"This is a cute, super clean Vietnamese restaurant with excellent food.  Tonight we tried Pho 1 and Pho 3 and both were excellent.  We also enjoyed the chicken potstickers.  Servers were helpful, friendly and prompt.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I came across this restaurant by accident. We came in with positive attitudes and hoped for a satisfying experience. Unfortunately, we were not prepared for what we encountered. It took about forty five minutes for us to receive our food in this empty restaurant, but I hoped the food would be worth it. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, and the chicken was smothered in sauce - being hardly edible. The grilled lemon chicken that two other family members ordered needed to be returned due to it being cold. The grilled pork was satisyingly warm in temperature, but nothing special. The server never officially took our drink order, and never came back to refill our water. This was definitely not a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Great place. Clean and fresh. A real favorite.  B4 and shrimp rolls. Highly recommended. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"It does get a 5 star for food, but they really need a cleaning service and another waitress. That being said, me and my husband eat here 3X's per week:) There food is always hot, fresh and fast. The Pho is the best I have ever had and cheap too! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Our favorite Pho restaurant!   We come back often for great food& great service!  Family owned and they are all friendly & caring!   Clean & fresh interior... plus outside seating!   Great"}
{"text":"Modest design, good food, terrific service.  I'm a big fan of their Pho and Vermicelli dishes.  Their Boba drinks are super addictive too.  I usually call-in my order for pickup, and it's typically ready within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"A friend of mine mentioned this restaurant to me since it's close to her place, so I thought I'd try it out. The Pho noodle soup was overall just okay, broth could have been more flavorful even after adding some sauces to the soup which didn't help too much unfortunately. I also tried the Lemongrass Chicken rice plate on another visit which was decent but nothing out of the ordinary. The portions for that were pretty good and I wouldn't mind trying another rice dish at this restaurant.  I could tell that the owners are really caring people with how they handle their food and service. It might be better to order takeout at this restaurant since the interior is nothing much to look at. I'd come back here to try some of their other dishes but may pass up on their noodle soup next time."}
{"text":"Great place. New ownership of 4 months, nicely remodeled. They use Romain lettuce instead of ice berg which is amazing. Unique crunchiness to the spring rolls. Highly recommend. Great service, awesome menu, and yummy food. They also do catering platters which I'm interested in."}
{"text":"Khoa is the new owners son and he is so sweet!! The restaurant is clean and modern but you would never tell by the shopping center. Khoa is a gentlemen and has great customer service.  The Pho is great!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls and pho were absolutely amazing. The service was excellent and the staff were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I ordered takeaway and it was great. The noodle bowl had a good balance of ingredients, flavor, and crunchy, fresh vegetables. The meatball pho also was very flavorful, I think they use good quality ingredients. Simple and fresh tasting. I will definitely be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Been going to \"the B4 place\" forever! Some of my customers introduced me to Dong Phuong Saigon Bowl about 15 years ago - everybody at GD seems to call it the B4 place - because what you want to order is the B4 combo.  It's a Bun bowl - grilled pork, eggroll and grilled shrimp on vermicelli noodles. Tasty and filling.  Top that off with a cafe sua da (iced coffee) and you are good to go!"}
{"text":"We ate here many years ago and tried it again recently. Back then, the food add ons (to the soup, which are served on a separate plate) were more generous: a pile of bean sprouts, cilantro, lime, jalapenos and fresh mint. Recently, the add ons have diminished to a small amount of bean sprouts, very little cilantro, 1/2 lime, 4 slices of jalapeno and _no_ mint whatsoever, which is kind of disappointing, and its flavor is sorely missed in the soup. The soup itself is still very good; however, the server gave me a different soup than what I had ordered. The vermicelli dish with shrimp, beef, little egg rolls with sauce was delicious; their espresso is very good, hot or cold (I like the hot as it has no added sugar and it is a very strong, but not acidic flavor). The new decor is very contemporary, nice ambience and everything seems very clean."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and have driven by this place many times. We kept swearing we would make it in and we finally did. So happy we found a new favorite spot.  Let me start off by describing the interior. Super clean, modern and welcoming. We had the pleasure of having the place all to ourselves.  We were greeted by Khoa. He was so incredibly friendly and helpful when ordering. My boyfriend ordered Pho filet and I ordered a chicken noodle dish. They were both DELICIOUS. The Pho was our favorite as the flavors were just sooooo good!!! A must try if you ask me.   This restaurant recently opened and we are telling everyone we know to check it out. You will not be disappointed.   Thank you Khoa! You will see us often."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner at Dong Phuong the other night. Vietnamese food done really well!  Our Pho with seafood was great with all the right accompaniments. My Bun was really good and fresh with lots of crisp veggies underneath. The spring rolls were perfect. We were really made to feel welcome and enjoyed the friendly atmosphere. It's close to our house so we will make a point  of coming back!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick meal. Good selection of all kinds of noodles. Fresh ingredients, herbs are growing in the backyard. I like the way the dishes are presented with side of fresh herbs and extra sprouts, so you can adjust the content and taste of your noodle bowl to your liking.  Nice and prompt service.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Okay, so this review has been long overdue, like 2 years overdue. First thing you notice right away when you enter the restaurant is how clean the place is. Very welcoming. Definitely the best pho I have had in Arizona. I come here so often that the waiters remember pho tai, as soon as they come to take our order. I definitely recommend the pork sausage spring rolls, which I believe they actually make their own pork sausage in-house. The service is what makes this place a complete 5 stars for me. The brothers that work the front are always super nice and remember you. Never any long waits and the food is out fast, hot, and fresh."}
{"text":"So I NEVER write reviews, but this is worth the time! If you love pho, or are interested in trying it I have to say this place is amazing... I go here multiple times a week (I'm a full time medical student and don't have time to cook meals every day). I actually pick up my food just so i can go in and say hi. The staff is so friendly and helpful... I had no idea what taro is and instead of being rude or ignoring my question he went as far as googling the root and showing me what I was drinking! They care and it shows in there food... they cook with passion and love!!! My favorite is either the combo pho or P2 with tendon and a taro smoothie with boba and the spring rolls are worth the price and they are huge (it is a meal in itself)"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic find. The Pho was taste and was very well presented.  Our server said the restaurant was family owned and on hands on deck the night my adorable friend and I were there having dinner. He was amazing.  I would high recommend going to check this place out. Five thumbs up from me for sure."}
{"text":"Saigon Bowl is a cozy Vietnamese restaurant located about 3-4 miles from ASU's Tempe Campus. Due to recent management/ownership changes, the menu is now more focused on authentic Vietnamese cuisine including a selection of Bánh Mì.  For lunch I sampled Com Ga Roti (Crispy Cornish Hen w/ rice), Canh Ga Chien Nuoc Mam, and Nem Nuong Cuon. All three items were very flavorful and tasted incredibly fresh--clearly made to order. Regardless of what entree you choose, I highly recommend ordering Nem Nuong Cuon (K1) as an appetizer. It's a rice paper roll with grilled pork sausage, lettuce, various Vietnamese herbs, and deep fried egg roll wrappers which adds a nice contrasting textural element. Nem Nuong Cuon is served with a special orange-hued dipping sauce. And although I have no idea what's in it, it's so good that I could eat it straight up.   Some added pluses include friendly, courteous service, and clean bathrooms. Employees offer you water while you wait for your take-out order. Updated decor, lighting, and dinnerware also improve the dining experience here."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Seriously, I grew up with a best friend whose Mom is Vietnamese(,came to the states with her American husband) and the little old lady who owns/runs this place reminds me of her.  Growing up I was always given advice like, \"you drink lots of milk and you wont be fat.\"  She always had food cooking, and the smells of her house were so unique.  My favorite thing about Vietnamese mothers is that they dote on their children while complaining.  I was always spending the night at her house, and when I would wake up, my clothes from the night before would be washed, starched, ironed (including my undies,) and everything would be folded in individual ziplock baggies.  Meanwhile we would get yelled at that she was always having to work hard to take care of us, and lord help her husband if he made her mad.  I swear Vietnamese mothers are awesome!  Any who, this lady is just as cool.  My first visit here was with a friend who lives down the street and recommended it.  We ordered it to go and were told it would take about 20 minutes.  So, we went and had a beer (or 3) at the dive bar in the same shopping complex and we went back minutes before the closing time.  As we walked it, it felt like a blast from the past.  The little old lady was complaining \"you order too much soup!  I had to make more soup because you order too much soup!\"  \"Oh, I so tired!\" \"I make SO much soup today!\" I knew right there that I was going to love this place.   The Chicken Pho comes in separate containers to keep the herbs fresh.  The chicken is separate from the broth and you get to mix it all together according to your like.  I usually can not eat all of it in 1 sitting.  The Goi Cuon, pork and shrimp salad rolls are delicious (I order an extra peanut sauce to dip.)  The fried spring rolls are good too (although the sauce that comes with them I don't like,) and I have had the fried rice and it is delicious and moist.  The crab puffs aren't very good, I wont ever order those again, but everything else I have ventured to try has been delicious.  Pho ranges in price from around $6.50-7.50, most Chinese meal combos are $8.50, and I think the salad rolls are around $6.   The little old lady doesn't always complain at her customers, and when she does she isn't mean.  One time I went in, and she was complaining about her new waitress.  Telling me how hard it is to train \"new help.\"  She will get over it fast and she will give you a genuine smile as you leave.  This is a locally owned Mom and Pop restaurant in a strip mall.  No frills, but they have been here for a while and seem to genuinely appreciate your business, even if they do complain a little.  We really did order too much soup.  Ate it for every meal for 2 days."}
{"text":"I came here 3 times in a month, thats how good it is! The decor is very modern and clean. The menu has every Vietnamese classic like pho or bahn mi's. I have ordered chicken bahn mi's and they are delicious. It came with all fresh cilantro, jalapeños, and basil and at a good price, $4!!   You can order food to go which is very nice and all staff are kind. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We love this place my daughter and I eat here at least once a week! They are always sooooo nice and the food is amazing   Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Nice clean, modern facility with a fabulous and wide selection of Vietnamese favorites.  Scrumptious and very reasonably priced, we'll travel to come back here, again and again! A must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing new find! A new LA family took over this place, and boy have they done a great job! Very clean environment, quick, courteous service, and the food is definitely 5/5. Their prices are cheaper than any pho place I've found in Phoenix yet, and they give you more meat/noodles as well, and the broth isn't too oily. Spring rolls are great (around here places can have subpar rolls, even though it's an easy fix), and their banh mi are delicious, meat's made fresh daily by an auntie in house. Iced coffee is great too. Literally can't complain about anything, I'm so glad I found them!"}
{"text":"You have to come here for the pho. Hands down!  My boyfriend lives right down the street, so whenever we're hungover, feeling sick, or need our pho fix, we always come here. Sure, we've been to the Noodles Ranch up the way, but we love going to the Saigon Bowl, it's so 'Mom&Pop.'  There's almost always no one else there and it looks super out dated. But we don't mind. We understand that Noodles Ranch is pricier than here mainly due to the atmosphere. But it's absolutely perfect if you just want to come in, sit down, guzzle down your pho and drench the meats in sauces and leave on a happy, full stomach while knowing you paid less than $9 bucks.  The portions are large, the veggie plate served with herbs, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and limes is pretty standard and of good quality and size.  The timing was just fine (although I've ordered one of their chicken entrees before and waited just a few more minutes longer than ordering the pho) and well worth the satisfaction to follow.  I've ordered just about every type of bowl of pho and have never been unhappy. Broth alone isn't anything too strong. It's light enough to have you finish the whole bowl. The meats are perfectly portioned for dipping in the sauces that are at each table and of course, the ending gulps are the most flavorful.  I'll always be coming to this place so long as it's in business."}
{"text":"Tried the pho Tai. It had an odd flavor I am not used to. Wouldn't order it again. I would say this place doesn't compare to noodles ranch . Also tried the Kung pao shrimp it was average at best. The decor is very outdated I felt like I was in a bad dream. I gave it two stars because the food was not horrible but definitely not anything to go back for."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the restaurant is immaculate, and the owner is gracious and accommodating. This is they type of business your should support. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The quality of the food and the portions are good. I normally order the Pho Special or Bun cha gio there. I've come here a several times now. The lady that serves us here is nice, but sometimes their service can be pretty slow since they don't have enough servers here.  It's the closest  Vietnamese place near work so I'll probably keep going."}
{"text":"This is prob the most authentic Viet food I have ever tasted in the states. The broth of Pho is really good, the bowl is full with meat. I really like K1 as well. It's even better than what I have tasted in Vietnam. Super happy with Viet food here!"}
{"text":"I've come here often and I am never disappointed. My last visit I decided I must write a review for them because of how sincere this business is. Not only is the food really good and the place is never super busy, so u can get in and out without running into everybody but the staff care about their business. I was minding my business eating my pho and a loud customer placed a to go order. She asked the staff to place the items a certain way because once something was off balanced and came out (prob the customers fault) I say this because she seemed obnoxious. However, I think it was the owner who was helping the customer and after the customer left u could hear the woman telling the kitchen to really focus on packaging to go orders. She even said to the other employee \"Do you understand, because this is how we learn and do better\" :) I think I just really appreciated a business taking ownership and caring about customer service even when the customer is not around."}
{"text":"This review was based on the PHO noodle soup.  By far the worst pho I've ever had. The noodles used were not the usual noodles. They used the dried type of noodles, big difference in taste. Overall, this place doesn't have good pho. I wouldn't come back even if they offered free pho."}
{"text":"This Place Rocks! No doubt this place deserves a 5-Star rating. The family owned business are very committed to making a positive guest experience, everytime!!  If the menu doesn't have what you want, ask and they will modify any dish. The B4 dish is a guest favorite and top on my list. We love the combo shrimp and pork spring roll appetizer with the peanut sauce. The restaurant aviance is simple at the corner of a strip mall. The place is very clean, correction... this place is spotless; including the bathrooms. We live in the area and they will deliver to your home for free. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Saigon Bowl is the best kept secret in the valley. It's a little hole-in-the-wall with the basic four walls. The owners are so gracious and make everything from scratch. If you're in a rush, do not go! They take pride in serving you and are humbled by those who appreciate their cultural food offerings. I'm afraid that if they ever became really successful, all the intimate service and raw quality would be lost.  Regardless, I'm writing this because they deserve to increase their customer base and do what they do best... serve authentic vietnamese food ...."}
{"text":"I came here Monday night around 8pm. I was kind of skeptical of getting their phò here but I was pleasantly surprised. The broth is pretty decent prior to making any modifications to it with the condiments provided at the table. The service was fast and friendly. I think the portion was decently priced. The noodle and meat to broth ratio was kinda scantly with more broth than sustenance but the flavor and freshness made up for this. I got the combination phò without tendons or tripe  and swapped it out with meatballs instead. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place is a classic it used to be the best Phò in the area and it still is. It's changed hands a couple years ago for the better the menu is as good but the new owners are making an effort's on the decor, straight out of the IKEA store it's fresh and young. Great Phò great Bùn and all the traditional Vietnamese side dishes and appetizers. There is nothing surprising on the menu but everything they have is good. I love to go there it's so affordable compared to other places in Scottsdale and the freshness of Vietnamese food is always welcome."}
{"text":"Drove by this place almost everyday and we finally pulled the trigger. I had the Beef and brisket pho and a spring roll. Definitely good stuff and I going to work my way through this menu. Very friendly service as well. We can't wait to head back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, BUT you have to be selective about what you order. If everything was great, I definitely would give this place five stars. Unfortunately, I've tried more than a few dishes that were \"uninspired.\"   Skip the following: all the Lo Mein dishes (it's just noodles, onions, celery, and the protein of your choice--no snow peas, carrots, peppers, spinach, mushrooms, water chestnuts, scallions, cabbage or bok choy), the shrimp and pork rice noodle soup (it has hardly any pork or shrimp and all the clear noodles get stuck together in a big glob--total mess), the filet mignon pho (it's got to be ground beef--there's no way that's filet).   Having said all that, this place has some of the best fresh spring rolls I've ever had! Every vermicelli bowl is outstanding, but B4 (shrimp, imperial rolls & pork) is the absolute best.   I haven't tried the sandwiches or banh hoi, but I do plan to try them.  The restaurant is very clean and the brothers that run this place are super nice! I would highly recommend coming here, as long as you avoid the dishes I mentioned."}
{"text":"Service was atrocious.  I was ignored, forgotten, and brushed off, in that order.  The pho was great, but I will not return."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I've had the Pho several times and I thought it was very good.  The vegetables and herbs included on the side seem very fresh and have an earthy taste to them.  It's a great place to order take out from if you're feeling a bit under the weather."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back from the zoo during rush hour. They've decorated the place in whites and bamboo green. Enjoyed the pho. Wife had a salad, and daughter loved her teriyaki chicken. The boba were tasty. The decor and calming music hit the spot. The gentleman who waited on us was extremely friendly, and the food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"Wonderful people!  Family run.  Mom is the chef and an amazing one at that!  Really yummy coffee! Oh man the Pho is soooo yummy!  If you haven't been here before you are missing out."}
{"text":"When ever I eat at Saigon Bowl, aka Dong Phuong, I usually order Bun with Beef or Chicken, however this time I broke my habit and decided to enjoy a bowl of Pho. .  In essence Pho is a big bowl of Noodles filled up with some sort of broth accompanied with some protein, and fresh herbs on the side.    The Pho Tai was the perfect choice for a healthy, light and flavor-full lunch and for less than seven bucks it certainly beats the usual fast food suspects.  Saigon Bowl gets thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delish. And so many options. Everything we ordered was so fresh and bursting with flavor. We had the homemade pork sausage spring rolls, meatball/brisket pho, noodle bowl with shrimp/pork/chopped egg roll, AND Kung pao shrimp. AMAZING. The waiter, who is also the son of the chefs, was so helpful in showing us what sauces to use to dress our foods and was such a pleasant server. Overall 5 stars, definitely coming back. I know I'll be craving this place- it was that good."}
{"text":"Just came from Virginia for business, I suddenly crave for some Pho and this place is just the right place. Pho ga is amazing with sweet broth and fresh vegetable. Thai tea is the just enough sweet to keep the aroma of tea. Overall the restaurant is very clean, so it make you feel like the owner really care about the place."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Vietnamese restaurant!  The broth for the Pho does not leave an awful MSG after taste like most restaurants in town.  It just taste fresh.  The nem nuong rolls are my favorite.  Plus,  they're always so friendly unlike most Vietnamese restaurants.  Did I mention how clean and cute the place is? Just wish they were open on Sunday, but hey, they need a day off, too!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in town   I recommend it highly great staff too!!! They just took over in Aug its very clean and food is amazing can't wait to come back I had the shrimp phone wow!!"}
{"text":"$8.95 Pho In A Clean Little Restaurant  The pho has a nice clean and tasty broth. It tasted fresh and that is a big deal for me. I really like pho, but some places don't do much. This place was good.   The service was good and the place was nice and clean."}
{"text":"I have known this place all my life. Yes there is a wait but that is because he makes everything fresh. Nothing is pre done. How am I sure ? My mother worked there for years! Yes they may seem unfriendly but that is because they are first generation to come to the States so English is there second language. But all you need is to give them a smile and they will give one back. Love love all the dishes ! And is a healthy choice. The prices have gone up but because the economy drop really affected this mom and pop restaurant. Give it a try you won't regret it!!! Xoxo sweet owners love them!!"}
{"text":"I was first turned onto this restaurant when I was 12 (I am now in my late 20's) or so and I have been in love ever since. My favorite dish off the menu is the Bun.. So light and cool and YUMMY! perfect for the hot summer months when a steaming hot plate of food makes you want to run away screaming.  The fresh herbs that accompany the dish are grown in the owners garden... i think they make a world of difference. This place is a dive, but is oh so worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING.  One of the best  Vietnamese restaurants in The Valley. The ingredients are locally sourced, fresh and well prepared. I had the shrimp and filet vermicelli noodle bowl with a Vietnamese coffee. The coffee is prepared in a traditional Vietnamese pour over and tastes delicious. Dinner was $10 and I had leftovers. Do yourself and your wallet a favor by eating here ASAP."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pho in town! I moved here about a month ago and I have already been here 6 times! It's the best! Btw--- try the spring rolls, they are so fresh and yummy :-)"}
{"text":"Clean establishment always great food at a great price. Friendly service I recommend the B4 bowl or any of the sandwiches. If you haven't checked this place out yet you need to!"}
{"text":"There use to be a great oriental restaurant in this location,sadly it closed up,it was replaced by this Vietnamese  Pho restaurant.The salad was a weird mixture of things I have never eaten before,part of it looked like it was pulled out of someones yard.The Pho soup was mostly water and noddles very little meat.Odd spicy taste.I greatly prefer Chinese food to Vietnamese food ,I can't believe anyone gave it a 5 Star rating,they must not eat out very often.Atmosphere plain.Plenty of parking.Very over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Saigon Bowl is an unexpected gem. Hidden in a quiet strip mall, it serves wonderful Vietnamese food. The restaurant is typically busy for lunch but quieter at night. I've been the only customer in the restaurant on more than one occasion.   I have been coming here for years for the pho and bun. The fresh spring rolls made with rice paper are delicious! The owners are always on site keeping an eye on things and running the kitchen.  I recommend ordering bun - a cold vermicelli noodle salad. Add your choice of meat and maybe a cut-up egg roll, and enjoy! Another favorite is the classic pho, a savory beef soup, featuring thinly sliced beef, noodles, bean spouts, jalapeños, mint, basil, and more."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to buy spring rolls. I've had the house specialty K1 sausage spring rolls, and the K4 shrimp spring rolls, and I  enjoyed eating both.  The sausage spring rolls come with a special peanut sauce which was delicious, and the shrimp spring rolls were very tasty and came with the usual peanut sauce. They were very fresh, with crisp vegetables, and thai basil. I also ordered the spicy lemongrass chicken (medium spicy).  It was delicious, and I mixed the sauce into the jasmine rice, to get every flavorful bite. Apparently it is a favorite lunch restaurant for local tech workers. Oh, and the prices are righteous! The K1 sausage spring rolls were $4.25 and the K4 shrimp spring rolls were $3.95. (2 rolls per order, cut in half, total of 4 pieces)."}
{"text":"Visiting from Charlotte, North Carolina and I am a Pho snob. I have a favorite place back home and don't deviate. This place was EXCELLENT. Fresh veggies, tasty Pho, great service, cute / clean ambiance. I got the Pho shrimp and it was YUM. Also great prices. Would definitely recommend to the Pho eaters out there!"}
{"text":"Very good service. Big portions. Reasonable prices. Caring owners. With that said, the restaurant needs a thorough cleaning and needs to maintain a sanitary  image at all times. The appearance of the dining room needs attention. However, good Pho."}
{"text":"I thought this place was very quaint, clean, adorably decorated with fresh, delicious food. The pho broth tasted more authentic than some locations that use powdered broth. I'll be back and I'll bring friends!!"}
{"text":"Local mom and pop place we go to often. It's close by. Since we usually order the same thing the lady that runs it always  knows what we re ordering. I went in once and she told me I needed soup. She brought me the largest bowl of chicken soup I have ever had. IT was wonderful!  She remembers we have a teenaged daughter and always checks to see if we are taking some home for here. It is very reasonable. Sometime in the evening they get really busy. Since it is just her and her husband, some people who came it were very ugly. Chill people these are good folks. Cut them some slack."}
{"text":"I'd give them 5 stars because I do love the P1. Admittedly, I have only had Pho at a couple of other places and can't really say that I'm a Pho connoisseur. There is something so homey about the soup. I don't know how they make it but I know that I have recently eaten most of my meals here.  The wait is at times a little long but I imagine it's because they do it right and magically.  My bean sprouts, herbs, and lime are always very quite crisp add ins and I haven't had any complaints. The chicken fried rice is also on point, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We ordered the Tom Tam Bot Chien (fried butterfly shrimp) and Bo Nuong Cuon (grilled steak spring rolls) for appetizers and an order of Bun Dac Biet (grilled shrimp, grilled beef and imperial (fried spring roll) over lettuce, veggies and noodles).   First, the customer service is AMAZING! Everyone is so friendly, attentive and helpful!   Second, the food was FANTASTIC!   I am a little weird about meat textures (if it isn't real AND tender, I'm pushing it to the side). I was COMPLETELY impressed and satisfied with the grilled shrimp and grilled steak. Everything was cooked to perfection, the sauces were tasty additions to the meal and the restaurant is nice, bright and clean.   100% chance of returning. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"So good .... so clean ... and the owners (staff) are sooooo nice and very attentive ... don't let the strip mall they are in scare you off.... you will be happy you found this little gem :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for pho! This restaurant is a very clean and serviceable place to go. I had P2, which is pho with sirloin. Plus, they are generous with their meat and noodles. Their limeade is soooo fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning can't stop pooping.... Don't eat the chicken u will regret it .. omg"}
{"text":"My friends and I we ordered quite a bit. We ordered 8 pho, 1 beef vermicelli noodle dish, 4 spring rolls, and 4 eggrolls. There was 9 of us and we all wanted some good pho. The broth tasted like it was a bit watered down, but everything else tasted great. It's a decent pho place and some said their noodle was a bit too soft to their liking. Pho is always a hit or miss, but even if it not that great pho still always taste good. The employees were very friendly and asked where we  live. My friends and I were here for new years, all from 3 different states and multiple cities hahaha. It was a great get together to travel here."}
{"text":"I'm not a pho junkie by any means, but I've had my fair share. I came to Saigon Bowl hoping to get some good pho. I got the Pho Dac Biet, and it was the best pho I've ever had! I will be back."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food. Came here for lunch with my family and we tried their Pho, chicken wings and vermicelli. They all tasted really good and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Yelp hits the nail on the coffin with how I feel about Saigon Bowl: Meh.  Great prices, but sub-par on everything else.  There are definitely a few red flags right off the bat with this restaurant.  1) The smaller menu.  Most Vietnamese places have a ton of menu items, with every pho, rice noodle bowl, and rice permutations you could ever imagine. But this menu was tiny.  2) \"Pho with Filet Mignon\" was a legitimate item on the menu and one of only about 6 Pho menu items.  Sounds enticing to the masses, but I've never had a \"Filet Pho.\"  Most authentic Vietnamese restaurants I've been to don't even know what filet mignon is.    Okay, I agree my \"red flags\" are much more superstitiously leading than I give them credit for.  But still.  They may not have a causal relationship with the quality of the food, but they're highly, highly correlated.  I ended up ordering a Vietnamese coffee over ice and a Pho with beef brisket (too much of a gamble for the filet...gotta go with a staple, y'know?).  My Pho turned out OK.  The broth was pretty good, but they skimped HARD...and I mean, HARD...on the brisket.  We're talking roughly 5 pieces of beef in an otherwise large bowl of noodle soup.  I guess it goes to show you get what you pay for with the sub-$8 price tag, but damn.  I would've taken a smaller bowl for $12 if it meant I got a few more pieces of beef!   The Vietnamese coffee actually tasted great and is probably one of the better coffees I've had in a very long time.  It may be the one saving grace of an otherwise sub-par restaurant.  They've clearly perfected the condensed milk + drip coffee mechanics, and the waiter will actually come back around when it's ready to stir and pour the coffee over ice for ya!    Side note on the Vietnamese coffee: I arrived late and two of my friends already at the table had both ordered the coffee.  One of my friends got his and was nearly finished with it, the other hadn't gotten his yet.  I got to the restaurant and sat down for a good 5 minutes before ordering, and 5 minutes later, they brought out my coffee...before they brought out the one for my other friend...who had ordered like 40 minutes earlier.  What??  It took another 10 minutes before they \"realized\" they forgot to bring out the second Vietnamese coffee.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and not pull the race card here, but given my coffee-less friend was the only white person at the table, the race jokes and/or connotations are inevitable.  TL;DR: Saigon Bowl's negatives far outweigh the positives, and the service seems to be a bit of a mixed bag.  Tread cautiously, folks."}
{"text":"Greeted and seated immediately.  Very friendly and nice staff took our orders.  We both wanted B4, Shrimp, imperial roll and chicken and one with pork.  Soft music plays on the TV.  The place is very clean and there were a few others eating their meals.  Nicely decorated.  The food came within minutes and our server thanked us for waiting.  The bun looked and smelled wonderful.  Plenty of sweetened fish sauce accompanied the meal.  The imperial roll was fantastic; crunchy and tasty without being greasy.  The meats were nicely marinated.  Plenty of parking..  we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the quality of ingredients you can taste. Takeout is amazing and they use great packaging so noodles are not soggy. I love the cleanness and modern decor. I go once a week at least. The pho is delicious but also B4 and K1. This is a must try and you will repeat. The staff is welcoming and attentive. Love this Family restaurant."}
{"text":"Give me a 5 star restaurant with a one $ price and I'm sold. Saigon Bowl is a perfect place to grab a delicious and authentic bite of vietnamese food. The prices are beyond fair, and the food- well, it speaks for itself. Normally, with price per dish averaging below $10 a plate, I keep my expectations for good service pretty low- However, the owners and staff at Saigon Bowl are the kindest and most genuine people! Their restaurant is clean, quiet, and all the ingredients are fresh. I know when I go to Saigon Bowl, I'm going to have a quality experience- in fact, you might begin to consider me a regular!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, I have being going for six years now. Friendly smiles, the staff work hard. Good food, cooked perfecly. :-) definitely best kept secret for sure. They take care of their customers, even if it means staying open a little bit longer for you. They cook the food as soon as you order it. So if u want quick food this isnt the place. The take pride in their food. Take care of it and them."}
{"text":"To say I am a fan of Vietnamese food is an understatement.  I eat it about once a week.  I came here from recommendation from my nail lady saying it was the best in Scottsdale so I had to know for sure. The location kinda sucks - in an old shopping center that you wouldn't think to look twice at. Everything on the menu is very reasonably priced! The servers are soo friendly and they always remember me.  Atmosphere is nice and clean, pretty modern and they have a small patio for when the weather is nice.  Thai Tea with bobba: This is like crack its so freaking delicious!!  Buddha Delight - Was a little disappointed in the flavor and the variety of veggies - nothing special.  I was hoping for more.  Shrimp Spring Rolls - these are tasty and fresh.  I am not a huge fan of peanut dipping sauce but I know thats traditional with rolls now a days.  House special pork rolls were delicious - they have this crunch to them and saltiness are perfect!  Filet Mignon Pho - I was expecting this to be the traditional slices of sirloin but it was more like a ground beef?  I thought it was a little strange but the flavor of everything was great! The broth was amazing!  Chicken Pho - this has been my favorite so far! Great flavor - shredded chicken!  Vermicelli - My friend got the B4 combo - this was fantastic!!! This is a perfect dish.  Its light and fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Saigon Bowl is not in my top hundred of Vietnamese restaurants. I'm no stranger to dives, so it's not that. It is the wait, the service and the food.  Even for call in orders, there is an exorbitant wait time. For pho, this is ridiculous. Normal pho broth is simmering all day, no? Well, the first thing that weirded me out was the fact that they asked if I wanted chicken or beef broth. Um....neither! I want the fermented fish broth that is the staple of pho! Blasphemers! I was not happy with the noodle quality either. They were clearly dry noodles of a lesser quality.  The counter service is curt and unfriendly. As I watched each patron come in or order, it was clear to me that customer service is not the strong suit here. I think they may have been annoyed with people in general...Asian or not. I also am suspicious of Vietnamese restaurants that try to supplement their menu with crappy Chinese-American food. If you do something well, you wouldn't have to cater to the apartments around you for cheap Chinese take-out."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I make a point to get Vietnamese food in every city whenever and wherever my husband and I travel and this place rivals some of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've tried. The service is outstanding, food is incredible and always consistent, and we love supporting a local business. This is our favorite restaurant in our neighborhood and twice a week is definitely not enough!! Thank you so much to the staff who always go above and beyond to make our experience the best experience possible! We love this place!"}
{"text":"What a little gem! Nice decor and appears to be very clean. The server (I failed to ask his name) is attentive and polite. Ordered shrimp spring roll and shrimp Phö to go. Packaged perfectly and included all the essentials .  The Thai basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, jalapeños, and lime were all fresh and they provided a generous serving, Shrimp were cooked perfectly and the broth was very nice and light. Spring rolls were great!  I will definitely be back next time I am in town"}
{"text":"Adequate and really fast Chinese and Vietnamese food.  It's okay, not fabulous, but at least it's not greasy.  The Broccoli Chicken was kind of bland and a little sweet, but definitely edible.  I'll give them another chance because it's so conveniently located between the school's clinic and the school and because it was incredibly slow and therefore very quick at 5PM  The bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Just tried Saigon Bowl for the first time tonight. I've been driving by it on the way home for years, but I began noticing it again because it got a bright new sign, apparently with a new owner as well.  We were greeted at the door and seated immediately at a cute table accented by bright walls, art and lighting--really clean and cute. We put in an order of chicken dumplings, and they came out in just a few minutes! We ordered two bowls of pho--chicken and beef. Both were delicious, and both came out lightening fast as well!  While the food was great, we were blown away by the service. Everyone on staff was friendly and polite, and it really helped boost our experience over the top. We will definitely be back, thank you!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the Valley so far, and it's close to my house! I came here for the first time with a friend, and wanted to try something new. I'd never had any bun bowls before, and it sounded nice and light, so I got the bun dac biet. It was SO good. I generally am not the biggest fan of fish sauce, but the sweetened fish sauce was deeeeelicious. The bowl had lots of veggies in it (in addition to the shrimp, pork, and imperial roll advertised), and was nice and light. I thought there was just the right amount of sauce to give everything flavor without being too salty or drippy. Though pho still holds a special place in my heart, I've been getting bun at every Vietnamese place since I first had it at Saigon Bowl.  I was really craving Bun last night, and so my s/o and I came here. He's had Vietnamese food before, but has never really liked pho (I know I know, what kind of monster is he?!) BUT he was also in the mood for something new last night, and got the pho, and actually said he loved it! I'm hoping this is just the beginning of him becoming a full-fledged lover of Vietnamese food. Fingers crossed!!"}
{"text":"New owners, new look. IKEA might have been a little emptier after their spree. It's been a long time since I've been here and was worried a little. Food was still delicious, and even some of the presentation of dishes was pretty instead of just practical. I got the bun with shrimp and pork. I've grown since my first review. So good. No diakon or chili flakes in the fish sauce but still good. Good ratio of meat and noodle and yummy veg. The BF got the pho filet which was good too. He didn't even finish. We shared the spring rolls and imperial rolls. Very good stuff. The place was empty mostly so some parts of the service could've been better, like asking for more water and later asking for a box. Not a deal breaker though. The two guys there were super nice and the food was delicious. Now open until 9. Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"First time at Saigon Bowl and Khoa was extremely kind. He had amazing recommendations - I had the Pho Filet Minon and it was delicious (highly recommend). The rest of the menu looked too good to pass up, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Very clean and the food is good. Price is reasonable and service is great. Food comes out fast. I always try something new on the menus. They have a variety of dishes!"}
{"text":"The best boba! Crab puffs melt in your mouth! Pho is delicious! And the service Is spectacular! Lovely relaxing , modern but still a gentle Vietnamese feel inside. Vegan broth is an option! Making this my newest regular pho shop!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very fresh. Service was very friendly. Very cute decor and clean. We look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"An absolute must for amazing pho and spring rolls. All the ingredients are very fresh and the service is great too! We had the vegetarian pho with steamed tofu, beef pho, pork and tofu spring rolls and everything was great. We can't wait to work our way through their entire menu. Plenty of options for vegetarians and meat lovers. Great portion sizes as well!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and delicious food! I ordered steak pho and a strawberry boba milkshake - both were soooooo good. I highly recommend Saigon Bowl :)"}
{"text":"Don't miss this one.  Excellent food. Five stars hands down!!! I've been coming here off and on for the past 5 years and we are both getting better with age. My #1 selection is the B4 with no pork and extra shrimp and no barbecue sweet sauce on the shrimp. It's famously known as BUN.  IT's Barrack Obama's and my favorite dish.  The young owners bring a refreshing zeal to the decorum.  A HIDDEN TREASURE. Be sure not to miss the hand made murals direct from Vietnam!  !!!!!"}
{"text":"Simple and delicious Vietnamese food in south Scottsdale/old town area. I usually called to place to go order. It is always quick and the food are fresh. We like bun noodle salad, and bann mi sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this place best pho and bahn mi in scottsdale. The staff is very friendly as well. Delivery is always very quick and everything comes nicely packaged. This place is awesome"}
{"text":"Most tender beef I ever had in my pho tai. Great service, imperial rolls are imperial. Support this small business. Yummy and speedy."}
{"text":"It seems they're under new ownership/mgmt. There's a new brighter sign, and the interior got a face lift. The food is great and the servers are always very friendly. The food comes out fastener now but is still just as good. B1 - bun thit nuong is my go-to and the new Vietnamese sandwiches are tasty too. We love this place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the new decor and food is awesome tasty and fresh... would definately come back better than Pho Cao....."}
{"text":"Went here for quick lunch and got the shrimp spring rolls with the pork sandwich. I will be back next time for the Pho. Overly friendly staff and clean place. Food rolls were perfect and the sauce I could drink! The sandwich was priced way under for how it tastes! Like I said I will be back to rate the Pho."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Saigon Bowl for some years now because it reminded me of the Pho that I would get back home in Orange County California. Since the recent management change Renovations and the FANTASTIC update on the menu!! it has turned into my favorite place to come I no longer have to say don't worry about what it looks like the food is awesome now the restaurant matches the food... You guys have to try the summer rolls it's a twist on the spring rolls has a bit of a crunch to it! And oh my God the sauce that comes with it is Amazing! To all my Orange County folks if you guys know brodards Saigon Bowls summer rolls are better!! Another thing I'd like to add is it still has that genuine mom-and-pop feel to it !!"}
{"text":"09/07/10  Came here on a coworker's suggestion.  He made sure I understood him when he said it was a dive.  Yes, Bill, I get it.  Once that was out of the way, he then said that this is where his family went for good noodles at least three times a month.  He's right- SB doesn't have much of an atmosphere, and it soon became clear that the majority of their business was in takeout sales (many were college students or middle-aged males).  So busy in fact, that my simple order of crab puffs and combo (beef and pork) noodles took longer than I'd expected (20-25 minutes).    The crab puffs were actually decent-- I would've preferred a toastier look.  However, they were nicely crisped, and not too greasy.  That is, after I'd toss them over a few hundred paper towels.  The noodles were tasty, and I preferred the saltier pork over the sweet beef.  (If only the noodle dish I ordered at China Magic the next day was as tasty as this one was!)  Be sure to have someone with you to share, bec. this entree won't taste as good the next day-- the noodles dried up overnight in the fridge."}
{"text":"I got the pho with tendon and tripe. It was pretty good but had alot of chopped up herbs and greens in the bowl when it came out. I've never seen that before with any other bowl anywhere I've eaten, it wasn't a bad thing, just a bit different and added some flavour into the soup. Its pretty close to work so I'll probably be back somewhat frequently."}
{"text":"I work down the street from this place and for a year never checked it out. Glad I did. The outside is unassuming, the inside is nice, bright, clean and modern. First visit I have the Pho second visit I had the chicken chop suey. Both very good. I will be coming back here for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Great pho without breaking the bank! This place is so awesome I am thrilled I live so close!! The staff is so friendly and knowledgable about their menu. I had the shrimp pho, it was so fresh! When they set down the plate of add ins in front of me, I could immediately smell the freshness of the cilantro. The bowl came out piping hot and smelling so good! My boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken plate. It was so fresh and lite. He loved that you could tell the sauce was made in house. Make sure not to forget your boba drink! I recommend the mango flavor! Don't miss out on the wonderful family owned place!"}
{"text":"A true hole in the wall... Unpretentious and pleasant--a family establishment. The staff were extraordinarily friendly. We were just getting take out, and despite the fact that it was dead slow in the restaurant, our simple order took quite a while. C'est la Vie. The Pho was good and the Tofu & Broccoli stir fry very tasty. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love love love \"hole in the wall\" spots, or more positively \"hidden gems\"... as you read the reviews, you will hear that description a lot for this place!  It truly is a neighborhood family restaurant, ran by a sweet older couple.  So the decor is outdated and the service is slow (he cooks, she is often the only server).  Don't expect overly friendly service, or super quick food.  But you can expect awesome pho!  If that is what you are looking for, this is perfect for take out... Food is great, price is fantastic and even the decor has its own charm..."}
{"text":"Great place ! Its super clean and the food is amazing! You can really taste how natural their ingredients are and they are fresh too. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Discovered this place on Postmates and absolutely loved it. I have done take out and dine-in as well. The service is always great and friendly.  Food comes out fast when you dine-in and orders are usually ready in 15 minutes for takeout. Great flavored pho and bun bowls. Unique flavors of spring rolls that I haven't had at other Vietnamese restaurants. Definitely one of my favorite Pho places in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Saigon Bowl a couple of days ago for lunch and was very surprised at the changes.  I was a regular customer of the previous owners for years, but have not been back in a couple of years.  The new owners changed the menu, and the decor.  Everything looked so clean and the place sparkled.  The food was fabulous with fresh vegetables and I'm so glad we chose to eat here.  The portions were huge (I didn't think I could finish it, but of course I did because it was so delicious)!  I had the Vietnamese bowl of noodles with egg roll.  On the menu it's listed as B2 - Vietnamese Imperial rolls, and my hubby had B4, which is grilled shrimp, Imperial rolls and pork, along with the noodles.  Both of us said how terrific these dishes were.  If you're in the neighborhood (or even if you're not, like us), I would definitely try them out.  I think you'll be very pleased you did."}
{"text":"My colleagues have raved about this place for months. Today, on my lunch break, I decided to give it a try. I placed an order to go for a grilled chicken banh mi, shrimp spring rolls and a Vietnamese iced coffee. After picking it up and bringing it back to work to eat... To my dismay, I discovered mid-bite in a spring roll that there was actual dirt in the lettuce that was in the spring roll. I was mortified. Might I add that it was also missing vermicelli noodles and cucumber. The grilled chicken banh-mi was not grilled, but sautéed.. however it did have good flavors to it, but since I am traumatized by the spring rolls, I will not be coming back for a second visit or ever."}
{"text":"we ordered chia gia, Vietnamese egg roll, wrap it with fresh lettuce and basil with fish sauce, man! the crispy egg roll was so hot and delicious, then came the #1 sausage spring roll with special yellow sauce, a must try. next is the famous pho soup, very authentic taste, I just wish they have the bun bo hue that time coz I am pretty sure it will be great, next time when I am in town I will"}
{"text":"We ordered take out twice while we were staying close by. The Pho had amazing flavor and went perfect with our bahn mi. My husband had the pork bahn mi both orders. We ordered the meatball Pho once and the brisket the second. Prefer the meatball. The staff was more than accommodating."}
{"text":"Clean and very fresh atmosphere. The green theme gives you some energy to deal with Arizona's heat.  Food came with reasonable prices. I had some salad rolls with shrimp and pork and a round steak pho which were decent. However, they only offer 1 size of Pho bowl. It's not a problem for me since I had salad rolls cover the rest of my stomach."}
{"text":"This place not only has amazing food but it also has the best prices. It has adorable decor and great atmosphere. There is even a cute patio. This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This is a good Asian restaurant, with good prices and great spring rolls. Great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing ! Service is impeccable . It's clean and contemporary. The owner and waiters came out and helped us order and educated us on different sauces! They recommended different food we hadn't tried. Everything came out in a timely manner and food was life"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp decided to come here for lunch with a friend. I got the beef lo mein wasn't super happy with it, she didn't like it either.   My friend got the orange chicken we both agreed it was amazing and  loved it.  I won't recommend the beef lo mein but I highly recommend trying this place. It's a great lunch place we got there at 12:12 and was in the car headed back to work at 12:45. You can totally make it there and back in a hour. The inside is super cute to and the boba is awesome! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pho here tasted authentic, and the staff was super friendly. I love pho places that get the meat to noodle to broth ratio just right, and Saigon Palace met the mark. The location isn't great, but the interior is clean and the menu is fairly inexpensive. This place tastes like pho from Vietnam! Definitely a must-try for pho lovers in the area"}
{"text":"The best! Great take out. Fast service. K2 appetizer and b-4 It is newly remodeled. Very clean"}
{"text":"I have been stuffing myself past the point of fullness at this wonderful place for about 16 years. We stopped in today, and it has been beautifully remodeled, and the staff is even more friendly than before. Our waiter was showing me and my kids how to add certain sauces to the broth to make them even more delicious. The food is still totally fresh, full of herbs and amazing! This may be the only place I don't have to fight with my kids about going to."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. This is probably my favorite PHO in town. Very flavorful and tasty. The service was excellent. I got PHO with everything on it and house special grilled pork sausage it was amazing and yummy. I definitely be back."}
{"text":"The cleanliness of this place was immense and the service was impeccable. We were greeted right when we walked in, and for a Friday afternoon the place was quiet and very relaxed. This was a new place for us to try, and I must say I am super satisfied with it. Right as we sat down the server was polite and courteous. He gave us menus and allowed us to take our time. The selection is wide, so if you've never had Vietnamese food before, the menu is perfect. It gives a good description and most have pictures. We ordered our food and it was out in a timely manner. The best part of the entire experience, the food was well cooked and yummy! I will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"Saigon bowl has gotten an upgrade since I last came here. The space seems more open and inviting. The pho and the shrimp spring rolls taste really good. Our server was really nice. Overall I give this place a 10/10 experience in terms of food, environment, and service. One of the better pho places I have been to in Arizona. I will be back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"very nice, genuine people and service, as well as a clean place. i will go back to try more on that alone. ate here only once so far and it was good. it tasted more authentic and i loved how the chicken dish had actual flavor, not just doused in soy sauce like so many other places. looking forward to trying more!  also - the rice was perfect, sticky, not soggy or hard; just as it should be!"}
{"text":"This pho place is in a very unsuspecting strip mall. They package their food perfectly for to go orders (the noodles and meat are in a big to go bowl, the broth is in a separate styrofoam container) they are speedy and I enjoy their broth. The service is always speedy and friendly! I would highly recommend it his spot for pho carry out! Ps their special spring rolls are great."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Great renovation and food as tasty as ever. Pho broth is the real deal thing. Don't let any go to waste!  Impeccable service."}
{"text":"I was contacted by the restaurant and they apologized profusely.  They offered an opportunity to correct my order or fix it in the future.  I am updating my rating to reflect good customer service.  Perhaps my next try I can update it even higher and understand why others love it so much  Previous review:    Surprised by the awesome reviews.  That's the reason we ordered - we won't order again.    First, the wrong food was delivered.  However we were on limited time and didn't want to complain and wait for replacements.  So we tried to eat it.  The wings were SO hot that it was difficult to eat them, spicy not temperature.  But when we wiped off the peppers, they were more doable - if only they didn't smell like fish bellies, they might have been ok.     The beef chow mein however stinks so bad no one would touch it.  I mean wow.  Bad.    The sweet and sour chicken we asked for the sauce on the side.  Instead it showed up with tiny cubes of breaded chicken soggy and swimming in not good sweet and sour sauce.  Barely edible - tasted like it came from a can.    We ordered two orders of fried rice.  I can't speak to that because it wasn't delivered.    We ordered those rice paper summer rolls with peanut sauce stuff - again, not delivered.    We did have some kind of fried rolls that showed up and they were edible.  But they weren't enough to fill us up since nothing else was touched due to smells and texture."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was excellent, service was even better! I highly recommend it! We will definitely be back for more! Don't hesitate to try this place."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese food I have ever eaten. The spring rolls are excellent and the peanut sauce they come with is deliciously savory and sweet. The wait staff is also extremely friendly but not intrusive. All the pho (I've tried 3) are delicious and we'll balanced. The sandwiches are to die for, with the perfect amount of each topping. They also have green tea ice cream, which is a unique treat everyone should try. It's especially good with peanuts."}
{"text":"This is your stop if you want real food. Real fresh Asian food. Try it and you'll understand I recommend b4."}
{"text":"Let me clarify my stars:  This place is 3.5 rather than a flat 3.  I've never tried the noodle dishes (that I can remember), because every time I go the fresh spring rolls call my name.  Or maybe it's just the wet cilantro squeaking around in it...  I just happened to be in the neighborhood and had a craving for something light and fresh.  Now, had it been a few years back, I probably would have given the extra half a star.  However, a few things have changed with that little spring roll.  There's a lot of lettuce in it now, which is strange.  More lettuce seems a little skimpy to me.  I wished there would have been more carrot and pickled jicama in it, but there were only a couple of pieces here and there.  No bean sprouts, and very little rice noodle.  The lettuce  washed out some of the shrimp flavor.   Still, it was pretty tasty and the peanut sauce was really part of my craving, and that definitely hasn't changed - sweet and just a little spicy.  The Thai Tea was amazing and as refreshing as the spring roll.  Thai Tea is my old new best friend.  The little lady behind the counter is very nice and threw in a few almond cookies for us.  So my rating is lacking experience in most of the menu, but the spring rolls are still some of the best I've had in town.  Still can't beat my momma's rolls with my daddy's fish sauce!"}
{"text":"Hard to find great pho outside of California but I have found my go to place. Their Nem Nuong rolls are amazing and their broth is something made by the hands of a mad genius. Everyone working there is attentive. The meats are really tender too!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch because it was close to work. I love pho, and was happy that this was so accessible for me. I won't be coming back though, so I suppose accessibility doesn't matter.  The pho broth was tasteless, with very little good meat bits. Usual accompaniments (bean sprouts, jalapeno, hoisin sauce, sriracha, basil, etc.) were either below par or missing entirely. Our table was filthy, the floor was sticky, and the whole experience was generally unpleasant.  The spring rolls were pretty good, but not worth the rest of the experience.  If you can, go to Pho Ao Sen."}
{"text":"This is the spot! The place is cute & clean. The service is spot on and the food is wonderful! Not to mention the prices wont break the bank. Mos-def coming back!"}
{"text":"Been going to \"B4\" for years 'cause I work at GD.  I always had B4. Now with new owners, decor and menu I've tried lots more and I think it's all fantastic, spring rolls, pho, and the sandwiches, mmmm good.  BTW, they've kept item B4 as an homage to the old place"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for pho, but I had better. Since this place is just around the corner from our house, I decided to come here on a rainy day for a delicious bowl of pho. Unfortunately, I was so unimpressed. The broth had an overwhelming taste of green onions and white onions. The broth is what usually makes the pho stand out and I was disappointed that it did not taste like Christmas in my mouth. I will continue to keep going to my favorite pho place inside the Mekong market. Sorry Saigon, you did not make the roster."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Saigon Bowl! Especially the staff, they were very friendly and helpful. We liked how they showed us the different ways to add flavor/spice to our dish. We started with spring rolls and crab puffs. I would keep going back just for the crab puffs alone, but our main meal was so good too! I got the B4 Bun Dac Beit with shrimp and beef. It was delicious! My boyfriend got pho and we enjoyed that too. It's definitely our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"The dudes who own this place are so nice! My boyfriend and I come here often and it is always delicious. One of the best pho places we've been. They normally don't have a lot of people sitting in, they do a lot of take out. It's worth eating in and getting to talk to the workers!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since I was a child and continue to go back. This mom and pop restaurant uses fresh ingredients, home grown herbs and have a wonderful menu! They take pride in their business and it shows through the quality of food and customer service. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I always drive by this place on my way home and always wanted to try it. Decided to stop by on my way home from a bike ride with my roommate. The staff was so polite and so helpful! They helped up put the pho in our bike baskets AND the food was great! I've had pho from a couple different places and this is by far my favorite. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had the shrimp role and shrimp pho and it was delicious. Looking forward to coming back and bringing some friends with me. The place is also spotlessly clean as well."}
{"text":"Worst pho ever. I've been to many Vietnamese restaurants in my young 23 years and this is by far the worst pho I ever tasted. The highest point of my experience here were the spring rolls, which were decent. However, the pho was just terrible. Usually I can finish whatever food I have (I'm not a picky eater), but this pho was so bad I had no choice but to leave, only having taken a few bites and tried to eat as much with seeming rude to the chef.   Note: To be fair, this was my first time coming to this establishment and I only hated (although this was a strong hate) their pho. I'm not sure if their other food is good, but I don't even want to find. That being said, good bye forever Dong Phung Saigon Bowl.   Overall: Service - 5 Food - 1 Wait time - 4 Cleanliness - 3"}
{"text":"I'm hard on pho joints.  Why? Because being from San Jose California I have had some great pho.  This place is just ok pho. It's not great it's not bad.  It's just ok pho. It will do in a pinch.  On the plus side, the service is great."}
{"text":"This is my Go To place for Pho in the valley. Ownership changed recently and the quality is good and staff are very attentive.  I travel quite a bit for business and know a good thing when I experience it!!"}
{"text":"Been here many times in the past, but a long time since, the Vietamense B4 Pho and Spring Rolls are still awesome and highly recommended.  Looks like the inside went through a nice update and seems cleaner than before.  The food is still top notch."}
{"text":"What an awesome surprise treat for me! Walked in to a very clean restaurant and attentive, friendly staff (even pulled my chair for me!). Food is delicious! If you've not tried them, try the wings! Different than your ordinary wing and oh so yummy m! Bun Duc Biet was also delicious! Pork and shrimp were cooked beautifully and they even let me have my sprouts in it.   I look forward to my next trip. Will be hankering for the wings sooner than later."}
{"text":"The Thai ice tea.... for sure my favorite and all the food is great... the employees are extremely friendly and kind....."}
