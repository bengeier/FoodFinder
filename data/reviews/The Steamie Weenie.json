{"text":"This place is amazing!! Not only do they have amazing hot dogs of all different kinds. They also have German dogs. Plus the coke in the glass bottles was an excellent touch with dinner. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my daughter.  She got the Jr Salchipapas which are French fries with hot dog and streamie sauce.  Love it.  I ordered a Nor'wester which is a hot dog with cream cheese grilled onions, scallions, fresh jalape単os and sriracha.  Odd combination that really works!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after picking up a menu at Popcorn Girl located nearby. It was great. Whether you want a relatively plain dog or one of the creations like the Jalape単o Popper the taste and quality are great. And the Tator Tors are perfect too, crisp and tasty. Several versions of those on hand as well. We have already been back for more!"}
{"text":"LORDY LORD the chilli cheese fries are the bees knees. If you haven't eaten here you deserve to get punched in the throat"}
{"text":"Reindeer dog for lunch? Absolutely! Great food and service, the only thing stopping it from 5 stars is the lack of beer. I like root beer, and they have a great selection of fun sodas, but.."}
{"text":"I have eaten a LOT of hot dogs in my lifetime.... Some remind me of home (dodger dogs), some remind me of family get togethers. Then there are those rare occasions that transcend the culinary delight and transform the way we view those little all beef naturally cased beauties..... 
That experience for me was last night. Yea, I've eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the world over the last 50 years of my life... Not to brag but just to set the scene if you will. 
The PB & JJ. Yes peanut butter and jelly on a hot dog.... Is it weird? Yes! Is it bizarre? Yes!!! Is it the best hot dog I've ever had??? HECK YES!!!!! 
Peanut butter and jalape単o jelly... Genius! 
My wife had a chilly cheese hot dog very good!! And the loaded tots are great and plenty for two to share. 
The vintage drink bottle selection they have is a lot of fun... I can't remember the last time I had a great cream soda out of a glass bottle... 
The place is a great!! I wish them all the success in the world and can't wait to see what they come up with next!!!"}
{"text":"The Steamiest Weenie. This Cute little HotDog stand is a perfect example of doing what you know and doing it Well. It's also an example of KISS or  keep it simple stupid. They serve the same Nathan's hotdogs that can also be found in the New York New York hotel but for half the price and half the headache i.e. You don't have to hit the strip to get a quality dog. 

The service was friendly, inviting, and informative. As this was my first time here, I can only assume my server was also the owner of the establishment, as she answered all of my inquiries with all the confidence and knowledge that comes from knowing a business inside and out. And if she isn't he owner, I hope she gets a raise, at the very least."}
{"text":"As a pescetarian...I haven't had a hot dog in oh...about 12 years...so when my husband's birthday arrived and he picked the Steamie Weenie I obliged as any good wife would...imagine my amazement when I turned up here and they had vegan hot dogs!!! Say what?!!! They not only had vegan dogs..but polish sausage, bratwurst, chicken dogs etc...something for everybody...and I know what you're thinking...vegan hot dogs??? Gross...no...DELICIOUS...I am not a vegan out of principle...the vegan shit on the market today is YUCK...but this \"hot dog\" was incredible...the Tot-Chos which are Tater Tots with all the fixings are amazing...not to mention the owners are not only great but all of their employees have been shown by example what great customer service is...these are the kind of establishments that we need to support as big company businesses take over Henderson...kudos to Steamie Weenie you are beyond two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service was great, if you have any questions just ask. The portions are huge, you shouldn't leave unsatisfied. The Carolina slaw dog and the Georgia scramble are delicious! So are their loaded baked tots! They have a huge selection of bottled drinks as well. If you are craving hot dogs this place will cure your crave."}
{"text":"Great dogs! I got the mt Fuji and my mother had the 9th island we also had an order of the loaded baked potato tots, loved everything about this place, friendly customer service along with awesome food!"}
{"text":"The dogs here are pretty good, large and very filling but I noticed they were kinda greasy and had me feeling ill within a few bites. Other then that very good."}
{"text":"Oh my God, I'm in love. Mom, meet your new son-in-law. What now...yes, he's a hotdog, so?!  

Although the location was a little hidden, I was able to find it and glad I did. There's not much to the place or to the service. It the hotdogs are damn right on. Had the BLT and added mayo and fresh jalape単os. Yum. Then I moved on to the Chicago. Two?  Yes, I was hungry and boy did it satisfy. 

Will be back for more. And more. And more."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service!! I've been meaning to try out this hot dog place for awhile now and I'm so glad I did. It's a mom and pop shop and the owner is very welcoming. There's a good crowd there with a mixed lot of families, couples, and people just having a good time. I love the relaxed vibe and the menu. The owner asked if I have been there before and I said it's my first time. He handed me their updated menu so I didn't get mixed up with the menu on the wall. So nice! I ordered the Coney Island Hot Dog (premium Vienna Beef frankfurter, special hot dog chili, diced onions, and yellow mustard) Das Wurst (German-style bratwurst with spicy house mustard and sauerkraut), and Loaded Baked Potato Tots. I thought everything was really tasty, great quality, and the winning touch for me was that buns were steamed!!! It may not be a big deal for some, but to me it elevates the hot dog to something special. Nothing beats warm soft bread with a good hot dog. I would definitely come back to try their other hot dogs and goodies . Also, kudos to their excellent service."}
{"text":"If you have not tried SW....redirect your car, SUV, truck, cab, motor scooter, bicycle, skateboard, Razor, or feet here! My first visit was to do a little hot dog recon (military vet here!), purchasing four different hot dogs to take back to a gathering for...taste examination:
BLT dog, Carolina Slaw dog, Mac n' Cheese dog, and Windy City dog. The outcome:
Mac n' Cheese got thumbs up!
BLT got thumbs up!
Carolina Slaw got thumbs up!
Windy City...got thumbs tentatively up (the neon green relish combined with the peppers,
     not so much, but the overall taste, good). If you are not a fan of the peppers, just leave 
     those off!

Yes, all their drinks are bottled, so if having the fountain type drink is your thing, you can STILL have a GREAT hot dog, tots (even specialty tots!), root beer float.  If you would prefer, you can bring your fountain soda in with you. Seriously, even checked with the owner and he was cool with that. Now, they have over 24 types of bottled sodas (including the line of Fanta's!!!!), bottled lemonade, tea, and bottled water. If you have children who may not be able to handle a glass bottle, they have cups behind the counter.

I'm not sure where the idea of the menu being painted on the wall was seen. When you walk in the door, if you turn to your left there is a large, framed area where the menu has been printed by category. If you want to see an individual one, they are right there to the left of the register. When they are really busy (I was there this past Saturday and wow....lots of people!!!!), you may want to just ask for a menu so you can be looking over your choices while you are waiting to order. That might be something to consider...having an employee zip around out there when they are really really busy and thank folks for coming, hand them a menu so they can connect before they get to the register. 

Today was my third Carolina Slaw dog in.....I really shouldn't admit to this....about 10 days. I know, I know.....I'm going to turn into a hot dog! But hey, what a way to go!!!!

In terms of price, you will pay essentially what you pay when you go through that fast food drive thru. Seriously...by the time you order one of those numbered selections and respond \"yes\" to making it a large and add tax, it is about the same give or take a dollar or two. The hot dogs and toppings are a great size/helping and I can't imagine going away hungry....unless you were nice enough to share yours with someone so you didn't get the whole thing!!!!

Today was yes, the Carolina Slaw dog, a root beer float (I chose O-So Butterscotch Root Beer for mine), a side of tots, and a bottled soda. The atmosphere is indigenous to the type of business it is. Picture yourself at a hot dog stand on a busy street in New York City. You walk up to the vendor, order your dog, and you stand there eating it....you might see folks juggling a soda or maybe they found a bench nearby and sat down. It's exactly what I would expect...stand around a high table and enjoy....sit on one of the stools available at the tables. There are two regular height tables with chairs as well. The restaurant is ADA compliant in terms of access for wheelchairs, motorized chairs, etc. If you were to come in and need one of the two regular tables and they were taken, I can't begin to imagine that someone wouldn't move to make it available for you. :-)

Long review, but getting into this marketplace with all the other food establishments must be a challenge. I say....if you haven't tried one, c'mon......give it a try!!!!! YUM!"}
{"text":"The Trailer Park dog was bomb! I also had a small side of the tots and they were crispy (but not oily) good. I don't know how else to describe my meal beside saying it was delicious. 

Today was my first time coming to Steamie Weenie and it did not disappoint. I've been craving for a good hot dog for the past week. Normally, I'd say lets go to Pink's but I live in downtown Henderson and hate driving in the traffic on the Strip. My fianc辿 recommended this place and now I found my new hot dog joint. This is definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Best hot dog joint in greater Las Vegas.  They win because they have an amazing variety of dogs.  My Nor'Wester was addicting!  I tried it without the jalapenos.  My husband's Windy City lived up to the name.  Tator Tots were perfect, and their house-made Steamie Sauce was a delicious addition.  Gigantic portions-- I had to take half my order home. You MUST try 'em!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the staff is very friendly! Their sodas selection is also pretty great. Perfect place for an enjoyable and quick meal or snack."}
{"text":"I walked into the shop with my son at 7:28 & a customer that was eating yells \"they're closed!\" Then the guy behind the counter says we're closed. I said that he previously told me they close at 8 & he said we close at 7:30 now. I stand there for a second just looking for him to offer a bit of empathy, maybe I'm sorry, or please come back, or come back & I'll offer you anything of just a smidgen of value to show you that I appreciate you coming out to see us??? He didn't say even one more word as we left. So sorry my son & I interrupted you closing your store early(it wasn't even 7:30 yet). Please accept our apologies & we won't ever interfere with you closing your shop early ever again! Unbelievable"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Loaded baked potato tots are a must. I do wish they had a fountain for sodas because I'm that thirsty guy who refills his drink 80 times in one sitting. However they do have a unique selection of sodas to choose from. Overall a great experience I will definitely be coming back to try a lot of the other stuff I didn't get to try today."}
{"text":"Really great place. Love the options and that they have a vegan dog! Staff is super friendly. We will be coming here again for sure! They only have bottled drinks but carry novelty selections. The dining room and restrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"Totally worth the price! The hot dogs are actually big enough to be full off of one, and they're packed with toppings. The loaded potato fries were delicious too!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food was better than average. I got the Windy City dog as well as Maxwell Street dog with fries a side of Steemie Sauce and a bottle of water. The food was hot and made to order. The employees were very friendly and seemed that they really wanted you there and even did table touches to see if every one was enjoying their food. The atmosphere was great. It was clean and appeared to be new? Very nice.

The bad. Way, way, way over priced!!!. This meal cost 15.48. Being from Chicago no hotdog stand would stay in business charging so much. For a couple of dogs, fries and water should be 6 or 7 dollars at the most. No fountain drinks either. Only fancy high sugar bottles in a cooler to pick from. I chose water because their was no diet selections and was charged 1.25 for a 16oz bottle. The next customer asked for a glass of water and the just gave the water to him without charge. Seemed odd to give to one and charge another?

I won't be back because of the price. 16 for 2 dogs is not what I'm willing to spend on a lunch. But good luck to the owner because the details are good and you can see his heart is in the joint."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. A small little friendly spot. There's so much food. Nice amount of choices to choose from. Deff come here."}
{"text":"To put it very simply, they have a macaroni and cheese hot dog, which while some people may see as odd, is one of my favorite combinations ever. So I ordered it immediately with fries with little hot dog bits in it, and it all tasted AMAZING. I actually got sad when I was done because I enjoyed it so much.

The only con would be, like a lot of people mention, is the price. But it's okay cause not only is it tasty, it's a business, and if they keep serving quirk hot dogs like one with macaroni and cheese - I don't mind the price."}
{"text":"Got delivery yet still everything was so so good I could cry. PBB&JJ is my fav! If the jelly was spicier that'd be perfect!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend last week for dinner and we both were not disappointed. Hot dogs (and they have quite a selection of different varieties) were tasty and very filling. I had mine with the Mac and cheese and it was great. I also got an order of the loaded tots which really satisfied. As others have mentioned, they do not have a soda machine here, and a bottled drink (they have the glass bottles drinks here) will run you over $2.00 with no refills. Dinners for 2 were about $30 but we both got loaded tots as sides. Kinda pricey but quality is definitely there! Try it and you won't be disappointed. I'm going back soon to try the Windy City!"}
{"text":"Great hot dog!  Foot long all beef with some snap.  Had the Cheese Chili Cheese Dog with onions and sport peppers, it was great.  Next time I'm adding bacon, you should too!   Great new place in Green Valley."}
{"text":"First off, the service was very good and the man in the front was friendly. I liked the presentation of the food and how it was neatly placed in the box. Some places don't take care in this. The hot dog was good but was very skinny. The mac & cheese was very good. However, I thought $10 was pricey for a skinny hot dog and a tiny side of mac & cheese. I think I might go back for just the mac & cheese."}
{"text":"4 hotdogs and 4 drinks $32.00. I don't know maybe I'm just real picky. I know Wienerschnitzel isn't kitsch, but i could get the same thing there for $20.00. For your build your own hotdog, the price starts pretty high $4.59... Then you add $.99 per toppings (ketchup and mustard are free) by the time you're done you're paying for $8.00 a hotdog. Again, my complaint- buns aren't baked there, they are store bought. I'm wondering if the tots are handmade there or not. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"So satisfying!  We tried a hotdog called More Cowbell which is beef frankfurter with pulled pork.  Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to give the Steamie Weenie a try. I was definitely surprised at how many options were on the menu! There's definitely something for everyone-including your vegan pals. The food was good! I ordered the Mac n cheese hot dog, but I'd probably get something else next time. It was a bit pricey, but other than that, there are no complaints. 
The service was great, and the owner is super friendly. I loved the steamie weenie mural that's painted on the wall!! We really enjoyed our experience. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"The dog days are over after I came here. They offer a full variety of popping they come from every region in the dog world. I had the hot link in the Polish in one sitting let me tell you the whole thing as an explosion of flavor with a firecracker afterburn the while the polish and spiced with multiple flavors it offers great satisfaction. For the money and for anybody this is where you go to get any kind of dog in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Awesome gourmet hot dogs! Didn't wait long at all and their soda cooler is filled with unique options!"}
{"text":"Tasty dogs and tots!  Love the specialty old school soda pop.  Friendly staff and good vibes!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and loved the soda selection. The hot dogs aren't bad, corn dogs are light on the batter and I'd skip the fried pickles and stick with fries. But all-in-all a nice place to grab a quick hot dog fix."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this joint!  One of the best hot dog spots in Vegas! (Henderson)  Each time I come, I try something new and have never been let down!  Staff is always amazing. Food sort of takes long but it's totally worth it. Make sure to order ahead of time if you're stopping by on your lunch break.  I love love loooove the jalape単o popper and the PBB&JJ!  Oh! And the loaded tots!  And the salchipapas! And the onion rings with their special fry sauce!  De-lish!  Be careful though.. I ALWAYS leave too full to move. You just don't know when to stop when it comes to these dogs!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. The menu looked like they had some interesting combinations. The dog itself is pretty good but was not enough to save this place. For the price I felt like I was ripped off. The flavors were underwhelming, beer cheese should not be a thing unless this was just a bad representation of it, and the batter for the corn dog wasn't that good. We also had the baked potato tots. This was also very underwhelming. The flavors were not very dynamic. The whole time I felt as though I could make this at home myself. 

Order:

Chili Mac Dog: hot dog topped with chili and mac & cheese.  2/5

Corn dog: basic nothing special. 2/5

Baked potato tots: basic nothing special. The beer cheese didn't add any real benefits as far as flavor. If anything melted cheddar would have been a better approach. 2/5"}
{"text":"I got to try the coney style and the windy city, and I'm happy to say that Steamie Weenie is on point! They served up two delicious dogs, and I'm happily going to go back to try some of their specialties. Their team seemed really gracious and nice, which is always a plus. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. Have to admit it's so cute and the staff beyond nice. They even remade a one of the orders for a little boy sitting with his dad without hesitation. Located in Pebble Marketplace, and quick walk to Starbucks, this lil eatery helps subdue lunch time crowds with its array of hot dog choices. Personal recommendation  is the Carolina slaw dog and a side of fries coveted in beer-cheese sauce.... MMMmm Cheese Fries... actually I would just come in for the cheese fries because that's how much i like the beer-cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for some dinner and omg the customer service givin by the owners is phonominal! They have a huge variety of unique hot dogs and the owners are so informative about all their food. I'm not really a hot dog person but, these hot dogs are amazing and the hot links are locally made! The price is really affordable as well. The only complaint I have is the restaurant does have a bit of a clogged sewer smell so if they could get that fixed this place will be a 5 !!!"}
{"text":"Awesome new mom&pop shop for coney island style hot dogs and then some!! Get the 9th Island or the Tucson Dog....and don't miss out on the Loaded Potato Tater Tots!! Next time, I will be trying the Trailer Park,  Mt. Fuji Dog, then the Georgia Scramble!

The owner and the guy who made our hot dogs were really friendly and welcoming - like a real successful establishment should be! Very impressed with their simplified menu choices and you can also customize your dog however you like it as long as they have that topping! 

Love the choices of the soda pops... Some I've never seen or heard of! You can tell they put a lot of thought into this place, which I believe is now popular amongst the yelp hipsters lol 

Well hurry up and check-in!! You won't regret it lol"}
{"text":"It was a really good hot dog but when I want to take my family there and it cost me $60 to feed them,  It's a hot dog. It is too overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Pros

Good for kids
Clean and fresh
Many options and custom hot dogs
Old fashioned sodas

Cons
$5-6 for a  regular hot dog with no fries or drink."}
{"text":"This was the best hotdog I've had in a very long time, I got the Coney!!! The owners are super nice and friendly, even though he's a Bronco's fan, lol!!!! I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for comfort dogs. There's a good $2 dog Wednesday deal. Plenty of variety for the expert dog connoisseur. Food was great, and Bob (owner) was helpful and polite.

One critique: they don't have drinks on tap, and choose to sell bottles from a large refrigerator. I wanted a cup of water, and Bob was nice enough to give me a bottle, but it's probably a good idea to get a drink dispenser.

Overall: 5 stars. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here but when I did go, everything was fresh and tasty.  If they don't have the toppings you want they offer to make it for you.  Only downside is they had no free water but last time I checked, they were planning on getting a water line to the front.  Excellent place to eat although a bit small.  Tables were a bit tiny as well, but I'm sure they opened the place not knowing how they'd do and want to keep expenses to a minimum.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened right across the street from my office! First of all, the parking lot sucks. The Pebble Marketplace is absolutely the worst. It's like the parking lots in Chinatown.. but busier. But get past the parking situation and you'll find yourself in a small little hot dog spot where the owners are a sweet husband and wife team. They have delicious combinations of unique toppings for hot dogs, and they all have cute creative names. Service is exceptional, and how could you not want to try a place called Steamie Weenie? Go for it, you won't be disappointed! (And whatever you get, make sure it has the beer cheese on it. DELISH.)"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, super friendly as soon as you walk in. The restaurant was clean and nice decor...the Tucson Dog was delisH!! I'm a little sad I didn't know about this spot sooner....but noW that I dO I'm excited to try other stuff"}
{"text":"I tried Steamie Weenie for the first time today, I had the PBB&JJ Hot dog, which is a bacon wrapped hot dog with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly, it was absolutely delicious! Thank you Steamie Weenie for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"First time to the steamie weenie, and it was a hit with the kiddos!  Loved the atmosphere with the weenie dog tagged across the wall and the fun collection of red, yellow, silver and black seating.  Lots of dog choices, similar to dodger dogs in size.  Will be sure to try the tater tots on our next trip.  Very quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"While looking through Yelp for a quick lunch spot, we found The Steamie Weenie. Of course, the name stood out which coerced is into reading further. After reading some reviews, we decided to give it a go. 

Bottom line, if you're looking for a great hot dog spot with friendly owners and chill atmosphere, check this place out.

One suggestion though, hot dogs + beer = Delicious!! Unfortunately, they don't serve beer (yet)."}
{"text":"Chaos is the Pebble Marketplace.  I rank it as one of the worst parking lots in the valley.  I have always dreaded pulling into it's maze of parking barriers, funky travel lanes occupied by crabby angry people wanting to play bumper cars with you.  We were in Hendo recently and in need of sustenance.  Despite the heinous parking lot, PM is filled with little gems.  I rolled into the parking lot and assumed the form of water traveling all the paths of least resistance until I found a spot on the north end.

Still not sure where to dine, we spied Steamie Weenie.  I had seen it was trending on yelp and with that developed a hankering for a hot dog.  I pitched the idea to the GF and did some quick research on yelp to see if they had a turkey dog or something similar to sweeten the proposition.  She agreed to visit with the promise of a vegan frankfurter.  

We entered and were greeted by Bob, the owner.  He happily explained the menu.  I spotted the Nor'Wester.  It consisted of cream cheese, grilled onions, jalape単os, scallions and siracha.  I asked if I could swap the regular dog for one wrapped in bacon.  Not a problem.  The crunch of bacon with the cream cheese was an awesome combination.  The bun was moist and very soft.

The GF got a Mac & Cheese dog with a vegan frank.  The Boy got something off the menu that was spicy with some fries on the side.  

There is no soda machine.  You do however, have your choice of an assortment of bottled traditional and novelty sodas.

When I am on this side of the valley again, I would absolutely look Steamie Weenie up again!"}
{"text":"We came back again, I had to try the peanut butter and jalapeno jelly hot dog. I didn't know what to expect with it, those tastes do not seem like they would go together well at all. But once I tried it, it was very tasty, I will be ordering more of these in future visits! I never would have thought to put PB&J on a hotdog, but I am glad they did, all good stuff from here so far!"}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday after finding Steamie Weenie on a top 25 restaurants list online.  We ordered the mac and cheese dog, the Carolina Slaw dog and chili cheese fries. I wasn't a fan of the Mac and cheese dog but my husband loved it. I thought it was a little bland. The Carolina slaw dog, however, was delicious.  Chili cheese fries tasted like pretty much any other chili cheese fries I have had. Since we split everything, and really really love to eat, we ordered the PBB&JJ. Its a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly. Sounds gross, right? It was the best hot dog I have ever eaten. Ever.
We were also very luck to be there when one of the owners was working.  I did not ask her name (I'm a dumb dumb) but she was so sweet and really a down to earth person.  We really enjoyed talking to her.  
Overall, when we are in Green Valley again, we will absolutely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Rob and Jane are amazing! My boyfriend and I came to Vegas for edc f and they definitely have that mom and pop feel to it. I loved the hot dog and the meat tasted pretty damn good quality. We'll be coming back next year! Thank you!"}
{"text":"So far so good! What lured me into coming here was the variety of toppings and creative combinations that they have to put on top of your hot dog. 

MENU:

They have the favorite regional classics; including Windy City, Coney, Tucson, Carolina.

You can also customize your hot dog too! Choice of beef, bacon wrapped or Vegan one!  Also hot link that's made locally.

The dogs they serve here are Vienna Beef brand, but the owner told me the bacon wrapped ones are Nathan's.

The fun creations: 9th Island! with Pineapple relish and Spam of course! There's one with Mac and Cheese too. 

Also novelty items they sell are vintage sodas in glass bottles with retro labels.  Upside: made with pure cane sugar, downside: a little pricier for the amount you get. There's no fountain sodas, so you thirsty soda addicts, don't count on refills.

ORDER OF THE DAY :

I ended up getting the Trailer Park with Beer Cheese, Fried Onions, coleslaw, watermelon rind bbq sauce and SPAM!  Yes you read right, Spam! Hot dogs don't scream healthy eats, so sure more nitrates, why not! I live for cheat day/weekend. Anyways good stuff!  Especially the beer cheese and watermelon bbq sauce. The hot dog buns were soft and our weenies were steamy! 

Oh try the crinkle cut fries!  They made these perfect!  I mooched some fries off of Mr.  B's order.  Crunchy exterior and potatoey moist inside . It doesn't taste like those store bought ones which I hate.   I regret not getting my own now.

LOCATION - ATMOSPHERE

This joint is located in Pebble Marketplace, where Smith's is the anchor. Hightop tables and barstools make up most of the seating in dining area. Cool graffiti wall art for deco. 

PRICE: 

Average... if you look at it from the \"it's a gourmet dog\" perspective. I personally think 
$6.28 for my dog is a little out there, but don't mind paying, because the toppings they added on justified the cost. But among the hot dog places we dine at, we spent the most amount here. The owners said they will have daily specials and deals coming up so look forward to those.  

It's family owned and operated. Staff was really welcoming and helpful!

Bottom line, cool niche for foodies. This place fits right here in Green Valley!"}
{"text":"Got the bacon wrapped dog and it was awesome. I got it to go, and the service was fast. We look forward to going back to eat there and try a few different dogs"}
{"text":"Gourmet hotdogs are a trend many people would like to see die already. Lucky for this spot, I am not one of those people. The weird name, cute logo, low prices, and a wide variety of menu offerings make this place a hot-diggity darn good spot. 

Follow them on social media to find out about their off-menu specials, such as the Run, Run, Rudolph dog for December: reindeer sausage topped with caramelized onions and sriracha cream. Simple but super tasty, it took a lot of effort to share this with my guy.

Solid menu standbys include the Everything Bagel dog (w/cream cheese and scallions) and the Japanese-inspired Mt. Fuji dog (teriyaki onions, nori, carrots, scallions, wasabi mayo). Don't even get me started on side options (tot-chos, anyone?!).

Location is cozy, service is genuinely friendly, and they even have a condiment bar to doctor up your dog with extra hot sauces and mustards. Don't forget about their house fry sauce and beer cheese!"}
{"text":"The customer service was great! How ever the hot dog were not. Our order was cold on the inside. In our opinion the food was nothing to brag about. The place was very clean. Just work on the hot dogs and fries. Which are your main items that are sold. To be fair we came more then once. We also asked our friends to try them too. Before I wrote this review."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. I'm not even a huge hot dog fan, and I'm already thinking about coming back. I had the Windy City and a custom hot link with mustard onion and jalape単o. Both were absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"The PBB&JJ was awesome and the Trailer Park hotdog was good as well. They also have a good/unique selection of bottled sodas. To top it all off the people there are friendly. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Our first time at this new neighborhood spot! We're vegetarians and we are in vegan dog heaven. Yes they have regular dogs, hot links, and even bacon-wrapped ones! But! Vegan dogs! And dozens of toppings from slaw to beer cheese to watermelon rind bbq sauce. 
I had a vegan Pushcart (with tomato sauce cooked onions, sauerkraut, and spicy mustard.) Kiddo liked the mac and cheese. My boyfriend enjoyed the heck out of a Windy City vegan Chicago-style dog. Fries and tots are a must. 
Friendly staff. Attentive service. And oh em gee the tastiest fry sauce I've ever had!"}
{"text":"By far one of the most eclectic hot dog places I've ever been to. They have a wonderful variety of dog and if your a vegetarian your covered too. The staff is extremely chipper. And to top it all off they have some of the most wonderful tasting root beers that are bottled this side of Texas. So if your looking for an amazing dog, or a unique dog and a exquisite root beer stop and and enjoy this amazing place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Dat Wurst and Dat was the Wurst hotdog experience of my life!  The weiner had the casing on it which made it very hard to eat and had zero flavor.  The Sauer Kraut was totally boring and hot mustard was not hot.  After challenging through two bites (not able to bite through the casing and had to drag the meat off with my teeth) I threw the whole thing away.  Six $$ plus change and it was gross.  Had I eaten in I would have complained but got it to go and didn't want to drive all the way back...I was hungry!  Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Are you looking for a great hot dog/ tube shaped meat? Steamie weenie is tucked away like so many great hidden gems between so many chain food and drink establishments. I happened upon this place and was unsure if I should go with what I normally would eat for lunch, but walking by the chalk sign outside that said \"the ring of fire\" a hot link with chipotle mayo sweet peppers and a jalepeno crunchy topping caught my attention! It was amazing the sweet peppers balanced the heat with the creamy mayo like a chef inspired snack. I grabbed a standard dog to sneak into the theater with me which I'm looking forward to eating. Dont hesitate to try this place. So many choices and even has a specialty meat during the holidays..."}
{"text":"SOOOO MUCH styrofoam :( 
Http://styrofoammom.com/?p=9 

Very expensive it seemed, for hot dogs.
However, the peanut butter one was AMAZING! Who'd a thunk it?! 

ALSO, THEIR BEER CHEESE IS THE BOMB!!

I ordered pickup via Yelp. 

Ownership seems to care about their customers too. 

I will be back...but to eat in, to avoid all the Styrofoam packaging."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. The hotdogs are great. Nice variety and the  service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Ok...I've read the reviews and for the ppl complaining about the price...get real!  This is not the normal hot dogs u get at the grocery store for 3.99....these are real genuine quality hot dogs!

And if you've never had a quality hot dog before the Steamie Weenie....you have been missing out!!  There are quality hot dogs out there and please don't expect to pay what u pay for hot dogs at the grocery store.

You pay for what u get. :) and for me...Steamie Weenie was absolutely worth every penny. I can't wait to go back!! :)

Now enough of my vent....:)

I went with my bf and we ended up getting 3 hot dogs and an order of tater tots with chili and cheese.  Let me tell u...the tots were for real. Crisp on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside like any good tater tot should be. :)

My bf had the Coney Style....And he absolutely loved it!!!

I was the little porker and had the Mt. Fuji and the bratwurst special. :)

Let me begin the review for the hot dogs and say....WOW....the buns were freaking amazing!!! :)  They were soft and almost just melted in your mouth. :)

The Mt. Fuji came with teriyaki onions, green onions, carrots and wasabi mayo....let's just say it was bomb. The carrots gave it that nice crunch and the onions a nice little bit of sweetness and the vienna hot dog had the best snap and alot of flavor without all that saltiness that I get with regular hot dogs. And of course I can't forget the nori....:) it added just a little without overpowering the entire dish for that umami flavor. :)

And what can I say about the bratwurst....it was delicious. Had just the right amount of mustard and sauerkraut for that perfect bite. :)

And if u love spicy food like I love spicy food....get their Habanero sauce. Omg....it added so much flavor and a nice but of heat.....soooooo good!!!

And if u ask nicely....they'll even sell u a bottle....:)

I can't wait to go back and try their other hot dogs...yum yum yum....:)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, cant believe ive never been here before it was amazing.. definitely hit the spot for both my fianc辿e and I. The customer service was amazing the atmosphere was great. The lady serving our food was amazing also. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I just ate lunch here. Pretty sure I'm going to eat lunch here tomorrow too! The Georgia Scramble was awesome! I added cole slaw to it to remind me of back home and I can say it hit the spot. Price is just as nice as the people are. Great job Steamie Weenie!"}
{"text":"Hell yessss this place has become a new holy grail for hot dogs in Vegas!!!! I didn't have high expectations upon the first time trying Steemie Weenie out since other fusion hot dog joints were a bit of a let down - nah this place is awesome. The menu options are awesome and their large variety allows to satisfy anyone with different types of tastes! Prices are amazing and they allow for some free add-ons as well as a choice to even completely customize! Solid hot dog joint, must try!!"}
{"text":"We were craving a Chicago style hot dog and found this place on Yelp.  It was very good!  All the ingredients were fresh, including the grape tomatoes!  It hit the spot!  My son got the kid hot dog which came with tater tots for only $3.99!  We'll be coming back when we're in town!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and took practically no time. The two guys working were really patient with my wife and me as it was our first time. They were cool about everything. Definite repeat"}
{"text":"Postmates is now like my go-to way of getting food. Why go out when you can have pretty much everything delivered to you? Including yummy hot dogs from Steamie Weenie.

The to-go packaging was perfect. My dog arrived just exactly how the pictures look. Pretty impressive for to-go / delivery. They also wrap it in foil and then put it in the to-go container. No leakage here.

It was difficult to choose just one dog. I was quite tempted to order 2 or 3. And I have a sneaking suspicion that I would've found a different choice more impressive.

So let's talk about my dog. I ordered the jalapeno popper one as it sounded spicy and unique - cream cheese, beer cheese sauce, and jalapenos. The dog was perfectly cooked. The bun was soft and yummy all on it's own (a rarity when it comes to hot dog buns). And I was impressed that the toppings were just right. It wasn't overwhelming and sloppy where you just taste toppings and not the dog. But they also weren't skimpy on the toppings either. It was definitely very tasty. But I was hoping for some more spiciness. But still, tasty.

I also ordered some crinkle cut fries topped with their beer cheese sauce. Again, perfect amount of cheese. Not so much that the fries got soggy. But not so little that there were naked fries. And the fries were perfectly done.

So while I haven't actually been inside this establishment yet, consider me a fan. And if you're someone who can appreciate finding that perfect middle when it comes to toppings (just the right amount), you'll definitely appreciate this place."}
{"text":"First visit. We will be back!! Really high quality hot dog, fresh bun, and the best Detroit style Coney Island dog in years. Tater tots hot and crisp. Good value. Great selection of sodas. Cock & Bull ginger beer for me, Faygo Rock & Rye in a bottle for my wife."}
{"text":"WHOOOOAAAAA STEAMY WEENIE hahaha. This place ROCKS in my book!! I have been here twice now and let me say that both times were very good. First time was this the family, wife had the trailer park dog, she is still talking about how good it was! My daughter had the mac-n-cheese dog and tater tots and I had a build your own dog, bacon wrapped dog with pulled pork beer cheese and watermelon BBQ sauce with onion rings for a side. The food here is so good, that I just had to drag some co-workers along for lunch recently. One of my co-workers is from Chicago and was bragging about knowing good hot dogs, of course she ordered the windy city dog and a green river to drink. When she was done I asked the question, her reply? \"That's the best dog I have had outside of Illinois\". 

The fella that owns this business is clearly putting his heart into the product that he is offering, it shown from the moment you walk in the door and continues thru your meal. You have a loyal customer in me!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot on a rec from Eater Vegas with my fam last week. Was so good and I am not that big on hot dogs since I was like 8 years old - great food, cool retro sodas. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best hot dogs in the Henderson Las Vegas area. Really cool little very clean spot. Very reasonable prices and they have a frequent Buyers Club super awesome."}
{"text":"Most say pretty damn good hot dogs that I have every tried. Got to try one of these awesome hot dogs and i must say I'm pretty impressed of how good it was.
It sucks that it's six dollars for a hot dog but for a first time try it was worth it :)"}
{"text":"Great great great!!! The more cowbell was sooooooo good! Soooo much flavor....a party in my mouth!!! The cheese chilu dog was also crazy good!!!! Tater tots and fries were wonderful!!! Great place!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! From the dogs to the sodas to the above and beyond service. The variety this restaurant offers ensures even the pickiest eaters will find something spectacular. Try this place the next chance you get!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place!  I live right down the street from this establishment and finally decided to give it a try.  I must say that I was not at all disappointed.

For starters, the owners are extremely friendly and welcoming.  Great people with great attitudes are the basis for a great experience.  They knocked it out of the park for me.

The decor is simple and colorful as one would hope/expect out of a hot dog spot.  Seating for about 20-30.  Standard fare aside from the custom painted wall which was a nice touch.

The menu!  I stood there chatting it up because I just couldn't decide what to choose.  All of the options were so creative.  I know I will be back to try several items but, this day, I decided to go with the following...

1 \"Trailer Park\"
1 side of Mac n Cheese
1 IBC bottled root beer

Total came out to 11.31.  Not the cheapest of meals but this wasn't your ordinary dog and side.  While not any one of the ingredients were outstanding, the combination was very satisfying.  It reminded me of my days as a child while integrating tastes I had acquired as an adult.  Very cool experience.  The mac n cheese was much better than I expected.  Had I not ordered it, I would have been all over a beer cheese option.

All in all, I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something new and unique when it comes to the classic hot dog.

As a note, the only reason I am not giving a full 5 star rating today is for a couple of reasons.

1) Fountain drinks should be an option for those that want to save a little money.  The bottled selection they offer is great but having options would be nice.

2) The standard franks, while lengthy, aren't very robust.  I picked my dog based on the fact that there was an added protein topper.  Will be trying the hot link or bacon wrapped upgrade next time.

Congrats on the opening!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so glad to have a good hot dog
place in Henderson. This is a local establishment and not a chain. These folks (Bob and Jane) have done their homework and are serving up the best menu of dogs in the valley. I love their cool selection of excellent throwback sodas! Where did they find this stuff?? There are so many creative offerings on the menu that you'll never run out of options. Or you can create your own with so many choices of toppings. The beer cheese and hot link should not be missed. Just GO and fall in love with Steamie Weenie!"}
{"text":"I think this is either a reason why I shouldn't be left in charge of finding somewhere to eat or proof that there's a method to the madness. After the steam subsided I'd say it was the latter of my statements. 

Go figure I found Steamie Weenie TOTALLY at random, but what a find indeed and by no means does the 5 star even do this place justice! Overall this was just simply perfection from beginning to end! I mean c'mon now see my pictures of how they segregate the bathrooms even (a weenie for the males and buns for the ladies). How can you go wrong?!?

Location wise it is based out of a small, but blossoming strip mall in Henderson and actually was not really much of a drive from the strip as well so certainly something doable. We were coming from the Southern Highland area (near the M casino) and it took roughly about 15 minutes and the restaurant itself was not that difficult to spot, but with a name like Steamie Weenie even in Vegas that tends to stand out? Ha-ha.

From perusing the menu ahead of time it was one of those \"has something for every member of the family\" type of menus. It had the regular go-to's for the kids, and what certainly made this outing even possible a vegan based hot dog (as I had a member who passed until she heard about the vegan hot dog offering) so definitely even among how it looks on the outside it was quite healthy on the inside.

As for the food, I did find everything to be surprisingly light and I did not feel like I needed to be carted out on a gurney afterwards which is a testament to the attention to health here. I went for the loaded tots as a side and they were prepared to golden brown perfection with a light crisp to it, but absent was the oodles of grease I'm used to getting pretty much everywhere else. Not scrimped on here was the \"loaded\" portion of the tots. The sour cream was lightly drizzled on the top of mounds of melted cheese, scallions, and the crowd pleasing: bountiful chunks of BACON!  

Now for the main attraction set to knock your tooth out, the trailer park hot dog! There was a lot going on in this dog, but somehow it all comes together and works marvelously. It starts with the great tasting all beef foot long hot dog that had the much sought after snap with each bite (I appreciated that more than anything). From here it was engulfed in piles of crispy fried onion strings, to die for coleslaw that would make the south rise up again, and literal chunks of spam (I think I had the equivalent of maybe two thick slices of it actually). What sets it apart though was for one the beer cheese (and yes there's a difference) and the watermelon BBQ sauce. It had me wanting to shout OH YEEEEEAH like the kool-aid man during each bite!

All in all this place is amazing. We did strike up a conversation with the owners as we walked out and I'm very impressed at how humble they were, but also just the care that they put into what they do. We were treated like family and I really begged them to open up a restaurant in California so I didn't dream of this in between Vegas trips. So definitely when you want a well prepared hot dog don't waste time on the strip and channel your inner dog. Think steamie and even think weenie and trek on over here as you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was just okay...pricey I guess I expected
More. I should have got a polish sausage instead maybe next time"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. They have a huge selection of ingredients and a large menu. I had the chili cheese fries, a corn dog and I can't remember the name of the hot dog but it's the one with wasabi mayo. all was good the corn dog was a great value at only $3.50. Just FYI no soda machine but a large selection of bottles of different brands. The lady at the counter was very helpful and patient with us since it was our first visit.  The only criticism I would have was that I thought the fries could have been cooked crispier but that is so minor. the chili was delicious and the portion size was good.  I'm looking forward to trying more selections in the future"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy beef sausage and added a bunch of toppings m; jalape単o, peppers, chilli, and cheese. I thought the combination was fantastic. 

The sausage was made carefully with all my toppings so it doesn't drip or get too messy. I thought the blend of all those toppings with the bun and sausage went really well. It was spicy just the way I like it.

The price range was from $4 to $6, which I think is worth for the quality of the food. I thought it was a bit small for me , so I'm going to get two next time !"}
{"text":"Great place for gourmet hotdogs! We will definitely be visiting there again! Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great place. Lots of creative dogs. The owners are nice people and easy to talk to. The wife and I tried a couple of there dogs. Good dogs creative toppings. Clean and friendly service! Hotdogs don't get better than this."}
{"text":"My husband said he had come here with work friends and it was good so we went right when they opened Saturday morning. (11am). The gentleman that helped us (and did the cooking) was very nice and had striking blue eyes. He helped me build a Carolina on a Jr hotdog because I wasn't that hungry. My 6 yr old ordered the Jr Corndog, don't let the name fool you, it was massive... perfect for older kids or even grown ups like me that love a good corndog. I saw the man actually cooking the mixture on the stove for the corn bread on the corn dog! The Carolina dog is topped with pulled pork, Cole slaw and BBQ sauce. I am picky about my Cole slaw so I got it on the side... I quickly dumped it on my hot dog after one taste... perfect. Lots of choices, great service, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent family owned joint! I had a craving for a Chicago dog or something similar and SW was the first place I found on yelp and it was a great choice. I had the Tucson hot dog since I'm from Tucson and all and I love the Sonoran style hot dogs. The ingredients were very fresh and tasted excellent. I also love their selection of unique and hard to find bottled sodas. Will definitely be coming back here more often"}
{"text":"Per owner, bottled water available upon request and meals deals are in the works if they're not already in place. Great response from the owner...just a tad bit late on my update!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and a neat place!  

I go for the Tucson every time.  My only critique would be that they use sour creme instead of the mayo.  I also like the variety of bottled sodas."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a great chili chs dog, should've went to Wiener schnitzel or made it myself. A reach in fridge holding cans and bottles of soda, no cups, no ice. She gave me a cock a mammie story of how ice ruins a perfect concoction. Really!!! Everyone else is doing wrong then ha. But hang on a minute she really was very nice and customer service was great, even checked on how I was doing that's why I gave three stars. The food, however sucked and way over priced 10 dollars for a skinny crappy hot dog that really wasn't very hot tater tots were not even as good as when I make them at home ( I thought they'd be a little better) this beer cheese, I don't know maybe it's an acquired taste ( I haven't acquired yet), anyway it was just not great.... honestly I read the reviews and I don't get it at all..... you'd think these were at least better than Wiener schnitzel and they weren't even as good. I've eaten at a lot of specialty hot dog shops, honestly this was a waste of a lunch."}
{"text":"I had the PBB&JJ. It claims to be life changing ... that is absolutely correct. Food and service was excellent. Not from Vegas but visit frequently. Will always make a point to hit this spot each time."}
{"text":"I'm getting ready for the incoming jokes & I don't care. Had a steamie weenie for lunch today & I loved it!!! read about these guys last week in the Las Vegas Weekly. Great original menu & creative choices. I went with the Mac & cheese & cheese dog! Fantastic as was the fast service & the friendly staff. Definitely support this new local gem."}
{"text":"As a self appointed hot dog connoisseur, let me start by saying I was very impressed.  For me it's the bun that makes-or-breaks the experience.  I'm very pleased to say that my Steamie Weenie bun was truly outstanding...not doughy, not dry...just right.  Combined with the delicious grilled dog and outstanding chili, I will be making myself a regular here.  I very much look forward to trying the great many topping combinations they offer...but will always also get at least one Coney Chili Dog as my go-to favorite."}
{"text":"I mean, it's probably the best named restaurant in town, ammaright? 

The food was decent. I went with the chili-cheese dog. Think it was called the Cheese Chili Cheese. Nothing too notable about it though. The chili was decent, there really wasn't enough cheese on there, despite the extra cheese noted in the name. We did get a side of the beer cheese and honestly that would have been a homerun if there was more of that on there. 

I think the best part of Steamie Weenie is their ridiculously awesome variety of bottled sodas. I can't remember which Cream Soda I went with, but it was top notch. They even had Dad's Old Fashioned Root Beer which I haven't seen in many years. Remember when you could get them for a quarter at Costco? Anyways, I think I'd be inspired to go back just for the pop. 

The service was excellent, especially for a fast/cas place. The kid who rung us up was super helpful and knew the menu through and through. Appreciated some of the suggestions he was giving on the soda front since that was a bit overwhelming.

This is a strong three star rating, but I'd like to see a little more out of the dogs next time."}
{"text":"Exactly what Green Valley needs! Amazing hot dogs and sides (definitely give the loaded tots a shot - you won't be disappointed in the slightest). Couple that with great, friendly service and I call that a winning combination. Definitely going to be frequenting them from now on!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. That have a unique  selection of toppings, dogs and sides. They do custom orders as well. The soda selection was better than most places as well because they have the bottles. Best hot dog place in Henderson in my opinion. Can't wait to go back and try some more of their crazy hot dog creations."}
{"text":"Great place!  My favorite is the Carolina slaw Dog and it is very good!  Second time this week actually (I have a problem)   the owners are very nice and informative.   I tried the pbb and j the first time I was here and didn't really like that much.   But the Carolina slaw keeps me coming back. I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great customer service. I got the vegan dog and my husband got the jalapeno popper one. We both enjoyed our dogs. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Found this place a few weeks ago and decided to try it. Soo glad we did. I'm hooked. I had the Mt. Fuji dog. It was really yummy. My kids had the Loaded Baked Potato tots. Amazing. We will be back really soon."}
{"text":"Second time here! They have such a fun and unique menu that you can't decide. Then after you make your choice, get ready for your taste buds to do a dance. 
First time I had the Windy City - you guessed it, a Chicago style dog and it was great! This time I decided to be adventurous and try a Fan Fave, the PBB & JJ. Yes, a bacon wrapped hot dog with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly. Don't say eww.... its a flavor combination that burst in your mouth. Everything goes great with bacon, and this dog does not disappoint. Creamy peanut butter melting on top of a bacon wrapped dog and topped with the jalapeno jelly. I also got a side of fries, crinkle cut which are great. Can't wait for my next visit, I think I will go for the Nor' wester!"}
{"text":"Randomly ended up here during one of my breaks. They are a new local business in the area that makes specialty hot dogs.  Wonderful food, and great service! They have a dog from every major city!  Try it out."}
{"text":"I love this place! We've made it our Sunday tradition to bring the kids here for lunch. The eldest loves making up her own masterpieces, and another loves the pbb&jj...a bacon wrapped dog topped with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly. So good!"}
{"text":"Great coney, very good chili dog with onions, very nice young ladies work there. Skinny snappy steamed and grilled dogs."}
{"text":"I had the trailer park dog and it was delicious.  It's nice that they have lots of tasty and creative toppings to choose from.  Also, the dogs are well priced. Down side is the bottled drinks and the side fries are a little pricey.  Overall, great food and I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Best tasting hot dogs with variety of dogs and sausages, oh and any toppings you want to choose. My favorite is bacon wrapped polish sausage with grilled onions. Didn't have grilled bell peppers but it still reminded me of LA street dogs. Also loved their bbq sauce on the side. Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Tried it today for the first time, and man was it good. I ordered the jalape単o popper and my wife built her own dog with a vegan frankfurter. I order mine with tots and her with fries. Everything was ready fairly quickly and was gone even sooner. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place. The staff is incredibly attentive. They have a wide range of sodas, fresh ingredients, and great dogs. I had two Chicago-style dogs with beer cheese and a very creative dog with SPAM. Trust me; when you're sliding one of their long delicious weenies down your gullet, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"The name alone is genius! The puns don't stop there. Each item on their menu brings humor and satisfaction. Das Wurst (German sausage with kraut and mustard straight from Duesseldorf) is my go to dog. They have classics from NY, Chicago and NJ too! For those vegan and health conscious - they have you considered as well. The owners are happy to answer your questions and customize the dog of choice. I highly recommend this joint for your next hot dog craving - lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"What a gem this is in Henderson! I drove all the way from Durango and 215 to see what this place was all about and I was not disappointed. My friend and I got the All American classics and they are some of the best hot dogs I've ever tasted. I would even dare say they are on par if not better than Pinks (yes I know... the people from Cali probably just did a double take...but you gotta try these hot dogs!) Nice small local business that sources it's stuff from other local businesses around Vegas. They also have other types of meat instead of the regular Vienna style hot dogs. My friend got the hot links and they were delicious. Overall, great place to eat and fair prices! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time at the new Steamie Weenie and if you're looking for a great dog this is the place. I went with a classic chili cheese dog and the Partridge in a Pear Tree. I typically don't like Chicken Sausage but this had it all. Great spice with some sweet and salty that brought it all together. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Tremendously overpriced hotdogs. You could get three hotdogs at the Der or Sonic for the price of one Steemie dog. 

Are they good? Sure. But are they worth it? An entirely different question you'll have to answer for yourself. In my view, no, absolutely not."}
{"text":"Best new place to hit in Vegas. New and fresh concept and the staff makes you feel at home and always smiling. After eating off this menu you'll need to come back for it more than once a week. We did! The bun to dog ratio is perfection. We've had the maxwell st, blt, and mt Fuji. Don't forget the steamie sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, the name is funny. 

Steamie Weenie is a no frills just good old-fashioned hot dogs with all the tasty fixings! It's like a bun filled to the top with pure Americana!

Must orders, The Tucson and the Nor'Wester. The Tucson is a bacon-wrapped dog with pinto beans, tomato, diced onions, tomatillo lime salsa, yellow mustard, and mayonnaise. Yeah, it was mess and it was delicious. The layers of flavor were fantastic, the perfect mix of spicy, salty, citric amazingness.  

You like a da spicy? You're going to love da Nor'Wester! This... cream cheese, griddled onions, scallions, fresh jalape単o peppers, and Sriracha. It's has a kick trust me, I was sweating while enjoying this bad boy. 

Tater Tot lover? Order the fully loaded tots and you'll be a happy camper. Tots, bacon, and cheese, you're welcome. 

My only beef SW are the buns. I'd like a sturdier bun, they tend to fall apart when you're only halfway done eating your weenie. Also, how about buns that match the dog? Order a Nor'Westrer, get it on a jalapeno and cheese bun or an \"everything\" bun for the Everything Bagel Dog? 

Just a weenie thought for great weenie spot."}
{"text":"Steamie Weenie opened near my house and I saw the good early Yelp reviews. I've checked it out twice now. First time I ordered a chili cheese dog and second time I ordered the bratwurst with tater tots. Overall, a great addition to my neighborhood, particularly because I love hot dogs and the owners of this local store really care. The only con is that it is pretty pricy. Each time, I spent $7-$8 on a specialty hot dog. It was enough for a meal, but more along the lines of what I'd expect to pay at a tourist site (although this is better quality).

To start, they care a lot about the food. When I tried the brats and the dogs, the owners talked about how many different suppliers and dogs they tried. They tried a bunch of sauerkrauts for the bratwurst too. And the bread is soft and fluffy, and the tater tots were fried up super crispy and fresh and salted just right. These little things show that they are paying attention to the food. Each dog is grilled after you order it, so it's much, much better than a boiled dog or a roller dog. The dogs had a nice casing and good snap with juicy insides. I will be back regularly when the mood for a dog strikes!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, we were looking for a good hotdog. We ended up coming to this place, and we were happy with the choice. The have great options for hotdogs and unique sodas."}
{"text":"We love love love this place! So many delicious permutations of the excellent quality sausages, the only problem is what to eat this time!! Wonderful addition to a town woefully short on good, geographically well placed hot dog places!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, little on the pricey side.   $4.89 for a hot dog with no fries (they're extra).  Hot dogs are hot dogs nothing special about these.  Wish they had actual fountain drinks instead of bottles. Personally I don't like drinking out of a bottle.  We Read an article about this place and decided to give it a try, not worth another trip"}
{"text":"very good hot dogs. lots of toppings to choose and they have specialty hot dogs. Chili Cheese Fries very tasty and cooked to order fries. Pricey about $6-7 a hot dog"}
{"text":"AMAZING people.
AMAZING environment. 
AMAZING FOOD! 
If you haven't gotten a chance to try them out then I can tell you with confidence you are missing out. Variety of options for everyone in the family and originality in all their creations. Wonderful locally owned businesses are few and far in between anymore but they definitely are one! They will for sure be getting my business again, again and again. :)"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at this place! We had the Mac and cheese and cheese, trailer park, and mt Fuji. They were all amazing and incredibly unique! The best part though was the pickle fries. They were so good that I wish I didn't have to share them. Thank you for the great food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Finding a good hotdog is like trying to find a perfect pair of jeans..... it's difficult. We have ate here multiple times now and won't be stopping any time soon. They even have gluten free versions for my fellow celiac disease people who just want a delicious hot dog!"}
{"text":"Great experience. The employees are really nice and the dogs are yummy. I had the Windy City with the vegan dog and if I'm being honest I'm already thinking about when I can come back. Many spicy options and try the fry sauce!"}
{"text":"You might as well call this place \"The Church of Weenie\" because these hot dogs are a religious experience! All hail the great and powerful Steamie!"}
{"text":"Good hot dogs, the owner or manager was super friendly and funny. I got the Chili Cheese and Onion with the loaded tots, my buddy go the PBJJJ or however  its called and the mac and cheese dog with a root beer. His bill was a little over $16 and mines was $12. He said both his dog were delish.. I couldn't get past the peanut butter on the hot dog lol. I only have two major gripes. I get they are \"gourmet\" style dogs but the prices seem a little steep, and they really should have a soda machine and not just bottled drinks. Me personally I will probably stick to windy city as I don't stray from basic hot dogs and the prices are more reasonable. If in the area again I would come back"}
{"text":"Newly opened hotdog place and I am from Chicago so decided I had to try it. 
Fun menu priced a bit high with the type of dogs they offer. I had a chili cheese dog.. two types of cheese. It was just ok. Chili was bland, the dog was tasty. I'd much rather have dogs at Coney Island at the D. Their chili is da bomb."}
{"text":"I just went to the Steamie Weenie after hearing about the reindeer hotdog. I got mine \"naughty style\" with spicy brown mustard instead of Siracha sauce. I got my husband the \"naughty style\" also and got the boy a kid's corn dog. My only regret is not ordering more! It was fabulous and worth the 25 minute drive. I'll be back. The reindeer dog had a more subtle reindeer/caribou flavor but I enjoyed it. I think most people would like it whether they like game flavor or not. I want to try the whole menu now. The kids corn dog is massive which was cool because I got to eat what my son couldn't finish. Like I said, I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I had a vegan dog with pretty classic toppings (mustard, ketchup, relish, tomatoes) and my fiance got a bacon wrapped dog with mac and cheese, BBQ, and their watermelon rind BBQ sauce... We spilt the loaded tots, and everything was fantastic! This is the real deal when it comes to finding a yummy local place, and the owner himself cooks and serves the food. Fast and friendly service--the perfect quirky lunch spot in Green Valley. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"First time here, so I figured I needed to try a few different items.  I turned to look at the menu and I was overwhelmed at all the delicious options.  So many delicious sounding hot dogs here!!  After a few minutes looking over the menu and arguing with myself, i got the following:

Savage
Jalapeno Popper
Loaded Tots

The Savage is just as the name implies.  It is SAVAGE!!  Oh my gosh was it delicious!!!!!!  I'm not sure of all the toppings, but I know it was a bacn wrapped hot dog topped with bleu cheese and grilled onions.  Easily one of the best hot dogs I've ever eaten.

The Jalapeno Popper was good.  I love spicy and this one hit the spot.  I especially liked that the jalapenos were fresh and not pickled.  The creme cheese adds a nice rich creaminess to the dog.

The Loaded Tots was my least favorite item.  I kind of thought the portion was a little small for the price.  Also, the toppings were a little light.  I'd rather have had a third hot dog over ordering these tots.

Overall a great place to grab a bite to eat.  Service was good.  Friendly staff and food came out fast.  I would definitely go back and feast again!!"}
{"text":"First of all the employees are really nice and go out of their way to greet you. Even when seated employees who walked by made a point to acknowledge you.  The restaurant was very clean. I had no idea there were soooo many ways to have a hot dog....I think there were at least 10 different hot dogs on their menu.  I had the Pushcart Hot Dog  which was very good and the ends extended over the bun and had a nice crunch on the ends. I had the loaded baked potato tots which were good too. No soda fountain, bottle soda and water only  and kinda expensive for a hot dog but I will be back!"}
{"text":"When it comes to hot dogs you either check the box with the \"Y\" or the \"N.\" I check Y. Who cares about Upton Sinclair or Nitrates? Solid food and service. Nice selection of condiments. The menu has a selection of regional favorites, in house creations, and build your own. This was my initial visit but, I will be back."}
{"text":"First time here !! Best hot dogs I ever tried!! Tucson is the bomb!! And I'll be back to try the other ones!! 17 more to go!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food! The hot dog is really good in itself, then you can load it up with delicious menu items or custom it your own way.  Friendly staff ,clean and neat! Fun fun fun side foods too!  5 stars for a little speedier food to table and would love to smell the food cooking..no smell sensories going on.. still  a homerun though!"}
{"text":"I Was craving a hot dog and stumbled across this place. Right when I walked in I was greeted by this sweet lady who right away told me what they offered. She was so welcoming and had a smile on her face the whole time. Food was awesome and exactly what I was craving. Will be back again"}
{"text":"Man, am I glad I came in here. I almost went to the Bagel Deli next door, but was completely turned off by their employee smoking and scowling out front. Decided to walk into Steamie Weenie instead.

Customer Service was great, people are in great moods. Quirky menu - I like it. I ordered the BLT Dog. My dog was absolutely the best one I've ever had.

I travel here often from Los Angeles, I will definitely make this place a stop along my usual route!

Way to go, Steamie Weenie!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found this place! I love the jalape単o popper and root beer float (you get to choose your own root beer!) The owners are always friendly too. Great food, great service, great price. If I could change one thing it would be that they were located closer to S. Buffalo but I am more than happy to make the drive out."}
{"text":"Omg super satisfied! Was kinda in the mood for a hot dog since I saw random advertisement for a basic style one. Looked up a legit hot dog place and found this. They don't skimp out on toppings! friend and I ordered the macncheese and cheese, trailer park, my fuju, and carolina. Left extremely full and happy. Will 100% go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My coworker had it one day, and it was so delicious that I HAD to try it. I went a few days later, and tried the trailer park with a Shirley temple vintage soda, it was amazing!! My friend got the BLT with a cherry limeade frosti and she loved it! I definitely give Steamie Weenie two thumbs up!!  I'll be returning this weekend for the 'Cheese Chili Cheese' 
and I can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"They have VEGAN hot dogs, and they are amazing!!! The mac and cheese and cheese is my go to. The prices are pretty expensive, but well worth it. I love this place!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about The Steamie Weenie, I was happy to finally try this place. The guy who took my order was friendly and the inside and tables were clean. 

Coney ($5.75) - Vienna beef frankfurter with their \"special\" hot dog chili, diced onions and yellow mustard. The hot dogs here are the kind that hang off either side of the bun. I'm not a huge fan of those, I personally like some bun with each bite.  Good amount of mustard and the chili did taste good. They have a lot of different hot dog options here.

Tot-Chos ($5.25) - Tots topped with beer cheese, chili, shredded cheddar cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos and sour cream. This was a good sized portion and worth every penny. The tots were perfectly crisp and everything tasted so good together. I'd come back just for these. My hubby had some and really like them too, even the fresh sliced halved tomatoes they added which he'd normally turn away from. 

There's a Teeny Weenie Kids Menu that's reasonably priced. No fountain drinks here it's a cold soda case with a variety of bottled drinks priced at $2.25 each. I'm not sure if it's still going on, but they did have in September a promotion called \"Weenie Wednesday\" where they sold hot dogs for $2 each and sometimes they have a special themed hot dog for the month."}
{"text":"Oh man! This was a life changing dog! PB&JJ!!!   :-D this is a bacon wrapped hotdog with jalapeno jelly!!!! What!? Amazing!! I've made a sandwich that was similar with ham. So good, but to experience was truly enjoyable. I also tried another hot dog with a spicier flavor... but I forgot the name. Right amount of heat and flavor. Oh well I guess I have to go back to find out what I ate. Highly suggest wrapping your dog in bacon. Yum"}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped hotdog topped with peanut butter and jalape単o jelly = amazing explosion in your mouth! We ordered the PBB&JJ, Jalape単o popper, 9th island, tot-chos and a couple of floats for us (many bottled soda choices) and a couple kids meals..if I could give this place more stars I would...it's very cozy and I love the art wall..endless combinations with their wide variety of toppings..family owned and operated which is awesome! Keep the weenies coming Bobby...until next time"}
{"text":"Wow! Great little spot for a dog! Their Windy City doesn't disappoint - even if they use dill spears instead of cucumber slices and no poppy-seed bun.
 On the \"new tricks\" part of the menu you gotta try the PBB&JJ. Peanut butter & jalapeno jelly on a bacon wrapped dog. On paper it sounds a little weird, but trust me - it is amazing! The jalapeno jelly isn't too hot & it  really is the perfect salty, sweet, savory, & smokey balance.  
  The Carolina  (pulled pork & coleslaw topped dog) was tasty, too. There are several ways to top fries or tots and a wide variety of bottled sodas are on hand. Stop in & say \"hi\" to Bob & he'll help you pick your favorite."}
{"text":"I bit my tongue earlier this week so I can only eat soft foods. I tried the chili cheese fries and to my surprise the fries were crisp yet when you go to town on the chili, softness!
My tongue isn't complaining and neither are my taste buds!"}
{"text":"This place is all bark and tons of bite.  This is by far the best place to get a dog in Vegas.  I have been been to Pinky's in LA and in my opinion the actual dogs in this place are of much better quality.  Price is great, taste is better, and they are down right friendly in this place.  I especially like their special dogs that they put out for holidays.  Egg Roll dog they put out for Chinese New Year was superb.  Try one of their dogs and you will howl at the moon."}
{"text":"9/27/2017  I had a doctors appointment near the Steamie Weenie and I had been wanting to try one of their dogs so I stopped in during lunch time.  They had a sign out front saying Wednesdays $2.00 dogs so I thought great, I get to try one at a discount.  The place had several customers eating and my order was taken at the counter immediately by a friendly person.  I asked if the $2.00 dogs applied to Coneys and he said he could \"dress up\" a couple of dogs for me.  I ordered 2 Coneys with mustard and onion.  The two dogs came to $6.60.  The buns were almost cold, the chili was luke warm, and tasted as if it was the cheap canned chili.  I was not impressed with the Coneys at all and was actually disappointed.  I thought at least the dogs would be steamed or \"hot\" and did not expect the canned chili.  The menu said the Coney's are normally $5.75.  I don't know how they will be able to stay in business selling a cold generic coney with canned chili.  Their other dogs looked appetizing but I did not try any, as I had to hurry home and see if I could get the mustard and chili stains out of my shirt."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying their weenies! 
And, I must say that when I first looked at the menu I wanted quite a few things. I went with the BLT. Its a bacon wrapped weenie that is fried and has lettuce, tomato, & mayo with a side of some crunchy yummy tater tots. The people here are sure nice. So, it went well with the food. Oh! BTW, I had to dip my tots in BBQ sauce and that was good too... Its homemade! Luv it!!"}
{"text":"Nice local independent hot dog shop. The guy at the counter that took our order was super friendly. The hot dogs and tots were good. A nice touch is that you select your soft drinks from a cooler and the sodas are in old time glass bottles. A great place for a casual meal in a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beyond fabulous. The thanksgiving dog, who woulda thought it could be so good? The windy city, from a Chicago girl raised on portillos, awesome, does need a poppy seed bun for true authenticity though, but it's fabulous as it is. Loaded tater tots, omg, get in my belly!! The soda selection, all in glass bottles, is something you don't come across anywhere else. The service is awesome, courteous, fun, and with a wonderful smile. All around, this place is top notch!"}
{"text":"Love this place tried it 2 days ago and can't forget the good tast! Great Job on menu selection and for the lasting taste. Simply awesome"}
{"text":"My fianc辿 and I stopped in today. Got the BLT, The Windy City & the loaded baked potato tots. OMG absolutely delicious!!! Very clean, one of the owners was actually at the counter and made our food. Now to me that says a lot. Def will go back here and I highly recommend Steamie Weenie!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! My fianc辿 works across the street, so we've been waiting for this wonderful place to open. We finally had a chance to visit today and let me tell you, it was great! Everything about this place, right down to the service! I had gotten the BLT dog -- not at all what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had also gotten the loaded tots, can you say yum? I can! Those tots are absolutely amazing. I'm bringing my friends/family back for sure. Definitely a must visit!"}
{"text":"Went here for Fourth of July for the first time and wasn't disappointed! We were pleasantly surprised, the hot dogs were great. I got a chili cheese with onions and boyfriend got the Carolina. Tried the pickle fries, they weren't too good, mostly batter not so much pickle. Will try the fries or tots next time. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hotdog establishment! I ordered off UberEats and the meal arrived looking as if I was in the restaurant itself. It's obvious that the staff goes to great lengths to prepare the finest hotdogs possible for customers. Look forward to trying all the various combinations available."}
{"text":"They have a nice variety of dogs. The staff is great and the food comes out quick. Try the mac n cheese and cheese dog. Yes, I said cheese twice! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't normally eat hotdogs so I tried German Bratwurst, it was delicious!  I could eat several of those!  It's a Gray thick sausage link. I ordered mine with coleslaw and onions, mustard and scallions. I love how they pile everything on top. It was so full of flavor, it was practically all over my face.. so good.  Cute place, with great logos. Very friendly staff and locally owned. The owner mentioned that the  sauces and buns are made locally.   Great to support locals, especially when they hit the nail on the bun..."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I've been coming here since day one! Best hot dogs ever! I just had  their new award-winning \"Savage\" and was amazing!!! Very friendly staff and the owner are pretty cool people! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter here after school, we had the worse cashier. She took forever to finish with the customers before us and was totally visiting . Like visit on your own time !! After we ordered , she took forever getting our order prepared and had an attitude . Don't go there to eat !! Save your money for a place that is appreciative of having your business !!"}
{"text":"I have had my  fair share of street dogs over the years in many cities.  When Steamie Weenie announced thet were coming to Henderson, I was a bit excited to say the least. However, this establishment is not my first or even second choice for hot dogs. Although I appreciate their attempt of having  a hot dog place in the neighborhood, I was not very impressed with the dogs.  

I had the Windy City dog and it was just ok. Nothing that would really bring me back."}
{"text":"Really unique menu with a lot to choose from. Loved the chili fries. Would definitely recommend to any hotdog lover!"}
{"text":"What do you do when you are hungry on your late-night turnaround trip to the Hoover Dam and back?! You grab a goddamn hot dog, of course! Boy oh boy, do these guys know how to make a killer hot dog to satisfy those road trip cravings! Make sure you grab one of the delicious sodas they offer to quench your thirst! Oh, and did I forget to mention, they're also vegetarian friendly which is always good when that one individual in your group of friends is anti-meat. The tots and hot dogs we ordered were beautifully prepared for us! One of the best I've ever had! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I LOVE HOT DOGS! 
Therefore, you can trust my opinion.

Food: I tried the mac n' cheese, pushcart, and a customized 9th Island. Mac n' cheese was cheesy enough without being over cheesy. The pushcart is made of: all beef vienna dog, sauerkraut, onion/tomato sauce, and spicy mustard, which was absolutely AMAZING. Now for the best hot dog, drum roll...the customized 9th Island Dog (bacon wrapped nathan dog w/spam, scallions & cheese). WOW, easily one of the best hot dogs I've eaten!

Service: Bob, (the cashier/cook/waiter/everything/aka superman), was so efficient it scares me! Food came out quickly and Bob was super friendly as well.

Overall: 10/10 experience. Check this new establishment out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best new small restaurant in town! 

Met a friend here for dinner one day to try it out as it recently opened.  The menu was decent sized, so I asked the cashier (whom I think was also the owner) which items were most popular. He gave me statistics on his top 5 dogs, which I was impressed with.

I ended up with the Mac n Cheese dog and I also asked for tittle bacon wrapped. Yes please!  My friend ordered a dog and also the loaded tots. We sat down and waited for out order and when it was ready, someone brought it out to us. I don't think this was normal, but since there wasn't very many people in the shop they seemed very accommodating. 

I cannot tell you how good my hotdog was! The dog itself tasted like a sausage, not a ball park hotdog.  Plus the crispy bacon took it to a whole other level.  The mac and cheese topping was so cheesy it tasted better than it sounded on the menu.  I tried my friends loaded tots and they were just ok. However I would like to try the salchipapas on their menu next time! Salchipapas are french fries with hot dog bits on top and other miscellaneous toppings.

When we were done, someone from the back came and cleared our table, even though we could have done so ourselves. This is a great establishment, and I will definitely be back here in the future!"}
{"text":"What a fun little restaurant!   The owners have put a little humor and a lot of taste ingenuity together to create a great little hot dog spot in Henderson.  The Dogs are unusual and delicious.  

Heads up - if you want a $1.50 hot dog go to the Fremont St. Experience because this isn't the place for you. You can guzzle crappy drinks with that dog.  This place is miles removed from that kind of experience.

I had the Mac & Cheese Dog which was delicious - it needs to have a little added but that is dependent on taste . . .a little salt . . . a little hot sauce.   The Mt. Fuji is not to be missed.  Next time in I'm going for the Carolina Slaw Dog and/or but most probably and the PBB&JJ dog.   

There are tater tots, crinkle fries and onion rings to go with the dogs. Over 50 kinds of cold vintage sodas, seating and a smiling staff.

The owner is engaging and fun to speak with. Without a restaurant to their name they dived into this creation and  I'm a fan.  The menu is diverse, the dogs are unusual and good, the place is fun and we will return often!"}
{"text":"Somehow, I always end up finding crazy, unique hot dog restaurants in almost every city I go to. What could I say? It's my thing!

Located close to Green Valley Ranch, this place serves gourmet hot dogs for very reasonable prices. My favorite is the PB&JJ hoy dog, which is a hot dog with peanut butter and jalape単o jelly to top it off. Let me tell you, don't knock it 'til you try it! Being a little daring and listening to the cashier's recommendations, I ordered it my first time visiting and it has been my ultimate favorite ever since.

As many have stated, follow their social media accounts to keep in track of their revolving speciality hot dogs. For instance, they have speciality hot dogs during Thanksgiving, Mardi Gras, etc. Sometimes, they even pair up with local charities and give some of the proceeds to them if you buy said hot dogs. Great hotdogs for a great cause, right?

Don't forget to try some of the sides they offer! Loaded Tot-chos and Doggy Style Tots? Yum! The names are as fun as the deliciousness of the items.

Service is as great as the food. Never once had a bad experience. Come and check this place out! There's nothing weenie about anything here!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Hot dogs couldn't be so good try the trailer park. Sounds gross but tastes amazing"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. I had no idea what I was in for on this one. \"How good can a hot dog be?\" I said. Well I found out at Steamie Weenie's. 

We had a group of 4 and we arrived before the lunch rush. The line rapidly built up behind us. The crew working here was very friendly and sociable. They let us know about the new hours they had (open earlier and later) as well as some new dogs they had coming. One of the dogs they mentioned was the Ring of Fire. It sounded like happiness in a bun, so I ordered one. It took about 10 minutes for my order to arrive, and it was worth the wait. The Ring of fire had a chipotle aioli, deep fried jalape単os, and goat peppers. It was flavored beautifully, like a perfect desert sunrise. It was refreshing without burning my taste buds. I also got the loaded tater tops. They were filling, I couldn't finish the basket. 

I must go back, there are so many dogs left to try!"}
{"text":"Awesome weenies! Cool bottled soda choices! Plus their chili cheese fries are so good. Great costumer service. They're super informative about the weenies. If you don't know which to choose,  because they all look sooo good."}
{"text":"Love these guys. Where everybody knows your name type establishment. Friendly,  family owned business who appreciates their regular customers. I enjoy having these hot dogs every weekend."}
{"text":"Immediately we were greeted and after made aware that we were newbies, they did not waste any time to explain the menu to us. They also let us sample the jalapeno jelly and the steamie sauce; both of which were very tasty. The jelly was still sweet but had that nice spicy kick for the jalape単o but it wasn't overpowering. The steamie sauce is a mix of mayo, their watermelon rind bbq sauce, and some other secret ingredients. 

My fiance got the jalape単o popper dog which had cream cheese, beer cheese and jalape単os slices on the top. It literally tasted like a jalape単o popper so the beer cheese was a nice addition. I got the trailer park dog which had spam, beer cheese, their watermelon rind bbq sauce, coleslaw and crispy onions (which I'm pretty sure is French's crispy fried onions). Super messy, but very tasty.

The real winner was their salchipapas fries. It had thin slices of a hotdog over the bed of crinkle fries along with a good portion of the steamie sauce drizzled on top. I think I'm addicted to the sauce because it complemented the fries so well.

Everything was made to order so everything was fresh,  crunchy and steamie. I will have to try the pbb&jj dog the next time I come back if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. I love to support small business. This is not a chain, it is a single location family owned business from what I understand. So show them some love!

The dogs are awesome! They have some pretty creative combinations. I've been there a couple times but suddenly as I'm typing this review I can't think of what I ordered because my stomach is grumbling thinking about their dogs! I know I had their hot link last time. I guess you'll have to go there and check it out!

There are several creative options to choose from or you can get creative on your own and choose from a huge selection of toppings. This is the place! There's not much else that is more American than a Hotdog. I promise you, this place in my opinion doesn't disappoint when you have a hankering for a good hotdog.

If I had one piece of advice for the owner; Fix the wobbly tables ;-). Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Hot Dogs any way you want with a myriad of toppings and different weiner options from Vienna Beef to Hot Link to Polish Sausage to Vegan.   My health limits me to how often I can eat processed meats but when I decide to dabble this is on my list.   Delicious albeit a tad pricey."}
{"text":"Had the tator tots today. Lightly salted and the most excellent tots I've ever had. Crispy on the outside soft on the inside and doesn't  leave your hands oily or greasy."}
{"text":"I will REPOST, since the owner had my comment removed... Yelp advised me of this and ask me to be more detailed. 

I went to the Restaurant on FRIDAY MARCH 3, 2017 to pick up an order. I walked in the Restaurant to ask for an order I was picking up and the gentleman at the counter (NO NAME TAG) was very vulgarer with me and used some foul language at me. I tried to explain to him about my order and he proceeded to keep interrupting me. 

I recently placed my own order to just try the food here to have a better FOOD review as well. The hot dogs are just like any other ones you would get elsewhere, but just really was not what I expected. I have a regular place I usually go to but thought I would try this place, not somewhere I would return to or order from again.

1. Food not the best for the quality I look for
2. The presentation is horrible
3. Customer Service is not the best"}
{"text":"Nice variety of \"gourmet\" hot dogs and creative side dishes. Friendly staff and priced right!"}
{"text":"Good tasting dogs, lots of options for condiments. But I thought they would be steamed and they didn't have that snap to them. The buns were not touched, would kick it up a notch or 3 if they steamed the buns. Fry's were ok. Lots of cool choices for soda."}
{"text":"Great food and great service in a convenient location.

My husband has been raving about this spot for awhile now, but hotdogs are not my favorite so I didn't rush over. Imagine my surprise when I started reading articles about how great this place is and it started to sound like something special.

The restaurant is decorated very cute for a hot dog place. The weenie on the wall is adorable. Most of the tables are high top tables, but some of the chairs have backs. A place to hang my purse! This excites me more than it should because normally I hate tall tables. 

Both of the people working were really friendly. I could tell they want to be successful and appreciate their customers. 

I had the Windy City dog. The hotdog was larger than the standard hot dog and delicious. The toppings were plentiful and tasty. The ingredients seemed fresh and better than what I expected from a hot dog place. For example, the diced tomatoes were definitely fresh and not from a can. 

My husband had the Tucson and Georgia Scramble. I tasted these and loved them. As with my dog the toppings were plentiful and fresh. The Tucson starts with a bacon wrapped dog so you can't go wrong with that.

We split the Tot Chos which was like a frito pie (sub tots for fritos). So good! Hopefully I'm not giving them too much credit, but the chili seemed homemade or they chose good chili because I loved it. It wasn't like the canned chili my husband sneaks into the house. 

I'm already getting hungry for my next visit from writing this. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to come here, but maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I went w/ jalape単o popper - beer cheese, cream cheese, topped w/ fresh jalape単o slices. I opted for .99 up charge of a vegan dog. Overall, I paid around $7.29 it was good, nothing spectacular and a complete waste of money. I believe if you come here you need to pay 6-7 dollars for something more extravagant. It was good, but they need to reorganize the pricing according to the items. I look forward to coming back. The staff is super nice and they give pun"}
{"text":"I have tried this place once.  My experience was good.  The selection is vast and dogs were great.  The owner happened to be working at the time, so I am thinking I got the best in terms of how the place intends to serve up a dog.  I think the key to any dog is the quality of the actual meat.  His dogs are excellent quality.  Good snap to them, and very flavorful.  I will be trying this place again.  The only downside is that I thought it was a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Great service! Aside from that, this was my first time and the menu was surprisingly full, we came for lunch are happily satisfied after getting a bacon wrapped dog, cheese chili cheese and coney dog. The different types of hot dogs are so creative. You have to try their fried pickle fries too if you go. It should be a staple, we're still talking about it hours after going."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly staff.
My husband and I stopped by because of the name and the good yelp reviews.
We both had the vegan dogs which were flavorful. I had the mac & cheese & cheese which was messy, but both the Mac & cheese and cheese were good quality. They have a nice selection of hot sauces to add to your dog if you want. My husband had the chili & cheese (which does have meat as they warned us). Chili was good and not too chunky. 
We split an order of tot-chos. Which had crispy tater tots covered in chili, sour cream, and cheese. The jalape単os and tomatoes on top were tasty and very fresh.
They have a decent selection of interesting sodas. Lots of root beer and cane sugar based drinks. Husband had the old school Dr Pepper. I even think I saw a celery soda. I wanted water, but they didn't have cups so they gave me a bottle of water for free. Nice touch."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of hot dogs available & the staff (at least the only lady behind the counter) was so incredibly kind! The hot dogs were very delicious & I enjoyed it so much. The chili cheese tater tots, however was okay, but still good. Definitely coming back for more of their hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Tot Chos and cheese chili cheese dog.  Food comes out fresh and hot.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Will definitely come back when I'm craving a hot dog."}
{"text":"The variety is endless and the hotdogs are good, but a little on the pricey side. The fresh corn dog was pretty amazing. The chili cheese cheese is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I never would have thought of putting PB on a hot dog, but damn it was delicious. The PBB&JJ is a bacon wrapped hot dog, peanut butter, and jalapeno jelly. Great combination of sweet and savory. Probably the tastiest and most creative hot dog I've ever had.

For a side, I had the Tot-Chos, which are tater tots with shredded cheddar cheese, chili, sour cream, jalapenos, and tomatoes. Like nachos, but replace the chips with tater tots. More of a traditional and familiar side order flavor profile. Also delicious.

This doesn't get five stars because of price. The PBB&JJ was $6.29 and the Tot-Chos were $4.59. For about $12 after tax, it was definitely a delicious meal, but I was still hungry. I'm not expecting it to compete with Costco on hot dog pricing, but I would've had to order another hot dog to be satisfied, theoretically pushing the meal to the $20 range. It doesn't feel right to be at that price point for hot dogs."}
{"text":"Yummy! I really like trying new hot dog flavors and The Steamie Weenie does a really good job on putting together different flavor combos together. Be on the lookout for their Specials because it's usually a limited time flavor like for St.Party's Day they had a corned beef hot dog with sauerkraut which was pretty good. The hot dog bun is nicely steamed too and that makes the hot dog experience complete. They also offer craft sodas if you want something cold and bubbly to go with your meal. The sides are all comfort goodness. I really like the loaded tater tots. It comes with bacon pieces, sour cream, and sliced green onions.  

Service is always professional and down to earth. It's a mom and pop shop and they make the effort to make you feel welcomed and are grateful for your business. They take the time and care to put the food together from prepping to presentation. Even on the to go orders! The food is never hastily thrown in a box or smashed together no matter how busy they get. As simple as a hot dog may seem, the fact that the workers care about how you get the food when you get home says a lot about the pride they take on their food and service. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I was feeling a good complex type of Hot dog today and my wife and I stumbled upon this place. We tried Buldogis before so we figure the name here caught our attention and boy was this place a hidden gem pretty much. The flavors on the dogs we got mixed so well and nothing overpowered the other. I would even go ahead and say this place is better than buldogis just simply because the preparation and portion size is on point.

I got the Carolina which has pulled pork, slaw and an in house made watermelon bbq sauce. This one was not over sauced like some places that smother the pulled pork in sauce, the slaw was very good and not watery at all, plus they used a Nathan's all beef dog and a soft bun to compliment the ingredients.

My wife ended up getting the BLT and damn that was good too. There was just the right amount of toppings in this with a nice bacon wrapped Nathan's dog fried nicely. The last thing we got for ourselves was the loaded baked tots, it wasn't overly cheesy or heavy after eating any of this. We could do our hike afterward without the bloated feeling like some hot dog spots give you."}
{"text":"My favorite Hot Dog place. You definitely Gotta try. Excellent Chili-Cheese Dog and wish I would have stopped in sooner. The price was very reasonable. Excellent quality ingredients too. They have Root Beer Floats too!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight and the hot dogs are fabulous!!! The owner was so nice and explained everything to us and overall it was a great meal. The Windy City dog was sooooo good!! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Talk about satisfying your taste buds! Hot dogs sounded good and tried this place for the first time. The hot dogs and tater tots are excuisit. We really have no complaints. The soda was delicious too, I had the butterscotch root beer and hubby had vanilla. My only thing would be the steamie sauce was too salty, but not a big deal I know to order less of it next time. We will be coming here many more times!"}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say I'm a plain Jane wen it comes to hot dogs...mustard and ketchup is all I like BUT this was a delicious hot dog. The best one I've had since the last time I can remember. The kids loved their hot dogs too. Love all their selections of old school soda's that come in glass bottles. YUM! The only thing I suggest to the establishment is a fountain drink station. I would have liked to get a cup of water and keep refilling it because I was thirst and can't afford to pay $3-4 every time I want to buy another drink. Also, I HIGHLY suggest a glass recycling bin for all those soda bottles. I came with friends and we went through 9 glass bottles of sodas in our one visit and they all went in the regular trash. All those glass bottles not being recycled everyday? Just my two cents :) give this place a try! SO many non-plain Jane options. You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Fun place for a float and a dog... food tasted great! Of you're in the mood for a dog, gotta check this place out"}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs!!! And the man working the register, perhaps the owner or manager, was so personable and really made the experience that much better!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Ron D must have reviewed the wrong establishment. The place is great. Many options for any dog lover. Today (06/01) they had a special called The Savage, which was a bacon wrapped dog with brown mustard, caramelized onions, bleu cheese, and a drizzle of some sort. I also got the 9th Island. Both were fantastic. Just all around great flavors. And a snap on the 9th Island dog was great. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Great dogs, great service, and great sides.  Have been a few times and always great.  Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Delicious and extremely nice staff! 

I was very happy with my visit!  There was hardly any wait time (even during work time lunch hour) and it was delicious.  Beer cheese was good and their fry sauce is ok but a strange after taste for me (but hey,  not everyone will like the same thing) 

Only drawback for me is the no fountain drinks-but have a great bottle choice and there's not a lot of chairs, so no big groups.

I definitely recommend the Cheerwine while you're there!  (No alcohol in it)"}
{"text":"Originally stopped for subway right next door, and decided to stop in Steamie Weenies instead. It was our first time there. Inside was real chill, some place I would've enjoyed going to after school. I had the mac&cheese n cheese with bacon dog and a side of fries. It was amazing! The bacon really compliments the mac n cheese..I also had grilled onions on it as well. The dog was complimented after every bite. It was so good even went back the next day and had the same dog, and same amazing tastes! 2 thumbs up! Love this place, already invited family to try it out!"}
{"text":"Staff was very nice that is why I'm giving it 2 stars. Tables are hit and miss. When we came in, nobody was there but some tables are still dirty. The hotdogs were so-so. Nothing special and very overpriced. I wish I can love this place as its very close to our place but paying $20 for 2 hotdogs, 1 side order of onion rings and 1 soda is just too much. I would rather drive further and get something else."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the hod dogs. They are tasty and pretty good size servings. Definitely. going back."}
{"text":"Pretty excited to try this place and overall was not impressed. Start off by saying the staff was very and outgoing but the hot dogs were not that good. Way to much toppings and way overpriced"}
{"text":"After watching an episode on the Travel Channel of the best hotdogs around the country, I had to find the nearest place to get my fix. I actually had Steamie Weenie bookmarked and heard about this place from someone before.

I stuck with the classic Cheese Chili Cheese dog with added diced onions and jalape単os. It was good, nothing extraordinary. Tasted like a chili cheese dog.

After trying my boyfriend's hotdog, that he custom made, I wished I had done that too. So he got the Vienna dog wrapped in bacon with spicy mustard, mayo, diced onions, scallions, jalape単os, and sauerkraut. It was a beauty and the flavors exploded in my mouth. It was so good that I think they should make this a staple on their menu.

Overall, I will probably be back. But it's not cheap. The two hotdogs with one side of tater tots and 2 drinks set us back $20."}
{"text":"Hot Diggitty Dog! Can't lie, the name of the place is what got me in here. If you know me, you know I love me some steamie weenies!!! This place is perfect for a quickie... you know grabbing a quick bite to eat! Duh you nastys.

Okay, all jokes aside, my bf and I wanted to eat something to hold us over until dinner and didn't want to be too full so we ordered the Windy City with a vegan frankfurter and a side of tots which we shared. They were nice enough to offer cutting the weenie in half for us. Toppings were yummy and I was no longer hangry. We also picked up a unique Pumpkin flavored soda from their collection of sodas which was delicious! 

Their menu does offer different variations of the hotdog, all of which sound amazing. I'd come back again for another quickie to try a  build your own with some different toppings. 

They're very friendly. They asked how the meal was a few bites in  and if everything was okay. Even wished us a good day our way out."}
{"text":"These hot dogs are amazing! As good as it gets! many options to choose from, and a build your own dog menu if nothing tickles your fancy. Just look at the pic! One thing to note though, they don't have fountain drinks, so not refills, but I prefer bottles anyway. They did offer us free bottled water, so no worry if you don't want soda. If you want a chuckle, take a look at the bathroom signs ;)"}
{"text":"Love the layout wonderful food everything quality and mrs. Thompson was sensational but such a simple menu that is killing the green valley food game.   A perfect lunch or party restaurant for a small gathering very fun"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I had a dog with pulled pork which was tasty. My only complaint was that they have no free refills on soda. The bottles are also very expensive. That completely kills places for me as I drink a lot. I won't be re visiting :("}
{"text":"Say what you will about a hot dog but I certainly think it's a delicous tube of yumminess. I love a good hot dog and Steamie Weenie really hits the spot. I've had the Pushcart, Nor'Wester, Chili Cheese, the BLT and the Jalapeno Popper. Jalapeno popper was probably my absolute favorite, followed closely by the chili cheese. Really though, I've never been disappointed by any of the dogs I've ordered here.

The price is right, the flavors are great and the customer service is always friendly. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Thought this place was \"OK\". Not something spectacular. The owner was a real gem though. So nice and willing to help us with anything we needed. Didn't think my hot dog was something I would go back for ."}
{"text":"Baseball season is just a few months away and I can't wait any longer so I need the next best thing hot dogs!!!

Steamie Weenie is the latest arrival to the culinary category of creatively topped dogs.
There are so many cool dogs to try, some of the classics like the Windy City Chicago dog, the chili- and mustard-topped Coney, and the Carolina Slaw Dog.

Among the goofiest are: The Georgia Scramble, adds a pile of oyster crackers to mustard, ketchup, chili, onions and pickles.
The 9th Island is mountain of fried Spam cubes atop a tangy grilled pineapple relish. 

I've tried a few, my favorite one is Jalapenos Popper Dog. Its loaded Beer and Cream cheese with Jalapenos. (Yum!) See when food tastes good, my rationale tends to fail on me. I thought it would be fun to mix the Yucatan and the Sriracha sauce together for extra kick. Needless to say I caused myself unnecessary pain for being stupid. I still managed to finish it though.

I'm used to mixing my mac&cheese with hot dog meat, so I had to pick the next logical choice the M&C&C, this dog tastes awesome!! It can get really messy if your able to eat it with your hands, I'd suggest eating it with utensils.

The staff are nice people especially Bob (the owner). He cares about the product he puts out and he just wants people to enjoy his food..

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs.  Try the veggie dog, really good.  Home made relish is excellent.  Tater tots are way overpriced.   The reason I don't go to this place more often is because I leave feeling broke and hungry.   They are just tater tots, let's not treat them like caviar !"}
{"text":"Ahh good ol' Steamie Weenie! This place is fantastic! Located right off GVR parkway and the 215 it's in an easy to get to, nice location. 

A family run restaurant that serves high quality food at a decent price, you can't go wrong! Me being from Tucson was excited to see they have a dog on the menu call \"The Tucson\" basically their take on an Sonoran dog. (Grilled dog, wrapped in bacon, pinto beans, mayo, mustard, jalape単o salsa, pico and cheese) 

So good! If you're in the area, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The customer service here was amazing, polite staff and great food. Our first time here and we'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find a really good hot dog place out here, so I turned to my good friend Yelp. So I flipped through some pictures and was sold. Unfortunately, that's where the excitement ended. My mom and I both got the Windy City because I consider that a safe dog, no one could possibly mess it up. My mom describes the hot dog as gross, the bun was cold and the hot dog was lukewarm. I agree with her, she even told the server and he did nothing to remedy the issue.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Was greeted right when I entered then asked if I had been there before or not to which I replied \"no, first time here\". The worker gave me a brief run down of the menu, which was nice. The dining area was very clean. Food looked and tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"Good, quality food. We've tried the chili cheese, mt fuji, and a few others ..."}
{"text":"My son has been bugging us to try this place. He told us about the PBB&JJ hotdog. It has peanut butter, bacon, & jalape単o jelly which sounds really gross on a hotdog. It was awesome! We also had the More Cowbell & The more mac & cheese & cheese. Everything was great along with the service. Can't wait to go again and try more."}
{"text":"Have only been here once with our local friends and glad we came.  Can't really think of anything they could've improved so I gave them all the stars.  Hubby and I shared some loaded tots and a chili cheese dog and loved everything.  Will need to come back when we are hungrier and try some other treats.

Oh, and love the bottled pop (I'm from Kansas) selection as well."}
{"text":"I discovered this gem while running an errand in the same plaza. I love hot dogs so I decided to stop in and see what it was all about, especially with a name like Steemie Weenie lol. They have so many options, from classics to crazy new twists that look delicious as well. I decided to create my own dog which had: cream cheese, grilled pineapple relish, jalape単o jelly and fried onions. The sweet woman working there who I think is also the owner recommended I throw a little sirracha on top and... hot diggity dog!!!! It was the most amazing hot dog I have ever had. The dog itself was cooked to perfection. I wish I would have ordered two to be honest lol. I really loved the unique options they had to offer, and I am so happy I found this place because otherwise I would have never known you can do so much more with a hotdog than ketchup and relish!! They also have a whole fridge full of vintage sodas only in glass bottles. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Trailer park ($6.25): premium Vienna Beef frankfurter with house-made beer cheese, creamy slaw, fried Spam, watermelon bbq sauce and crunchy fried onions. My dog had a crunchy snap and was pretty good. 

The owner was super nice and cool.

3.5 stars!!

The Steamie Winnie is kinda yummuylicious!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a hot dog place? I can't justify giving it 4.
Even if you just want a regular hot dog, you'll be happy here. But if you want to be a bit more adventurous, they probably have something you'll like (assuming you like hot dogs). Quality of dogs is high (good snap) and there's some creativity in the menu.
Some of my go-tos are the Fuji and the Mac and Cheese and Cheese. The pickle chips are always good, too. 
People have always been friendly."}
{"text":"The place is really good! The hot dogs are well cooked and taste delicious,the menu have many options, the service is excellent! Very clean and well organized restaurant, I will recommend this place for a casual eating or spend time with the family, definitely I'm coming back"}
{"text":"Finally more options are opening up for gourmet hot dogs, and the names are not boring at all. 
We've been here twice now. Our food was DELICIOUS. Somehow its never the same the second time, but still good. I ordered the jalapeno popper and my gf the Coney Island. Both were prepared quickly and presentation was amazing. They looked picture perfect. This was no McDonalds bait and switch. The Jalapeno Popper tasted exactly like a jalapeno popper and was amazing! My gf said the Coney Island was good. I can usually tell if she likes a menu item by the look on her face, what she says after her first bite, and if she finishes it. The Coney Island looked like a winner. The second time we ordered, the presentation was a a bit messy and the temperature was luke warm. We DID order ahead (maybe this is a factor). But for some reason, crushed expectations changes the flavor :(   Nevertheless we still love this place. 

This is one of the best places to satisfy your gourmet hot dog craving.

I use to hate hog dogs. I remember having to eat those plastic wrapped poisonous wieners from the regular grocery stores when I was younger. There are healthier options now and supposedly not full of whatever they use to stuff in these things...at least I will believe this is true."}
{"text":"Gourmet hot dogs with too many options to list.  I  the vegan dog and always make my own combos.  Fun and funky atmosphere and great prices! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We eat here at least once a week.  The hubby and I are both vegetarians, and while we have seen this place, we never bothered going in because we assumed that they would not have any options for us.  One day we wanted to try something new, so we decided to look at their menu.  We were pleasantly surprised that they offered vegan dogs ($0.99 extra), but even more surprised by how yummy their hotdogs were!  And not too heavy on the stomach, either.

Our typical orders are:  Mac & Cheese, Jalapeno Popper, and Mt. Fuji all with vegan dogs.  

Family-owned business, super friendly staff, and they always keep the restaurant clean!

Tip:  Because they steam the hotdogs as you order them, we typically call in our order ahead of time."}
{"text":"Besides a good dog, they are super friendly. The place is clean. I love this place and will be going back for more vegan dog creations."}
{"text":"We like to try hot dogs from all over the world. We had tried their PB and Jelly Dog at a Yelp event, it was very interesting and wanted to try more. We were in the area after a hike so we gave them a try. 
 These were OK, just nothing special, have had better. We got a Chili Cheese , the Tuscon, and the Trailer Park.  We also got a side of Tator Tots to share which I really liked, they made them nice and crispy, not greasy. Used some fry sauce for dipping, I'd go back for Tots. They have a selection of odd flavored sodas which is fun, had a vanilla root beer. 
Staff was friendly and got our food order fast and correct. The place was clean. Prices are on par with other fancy hot dog places."}
{"text":"Holy moly. Vegas needs more places like this!! Snappy weenies with a ton on themed toppings. Tried the Trailer Park dog the other night, was not disappointed!! We also had a More Cowbell, Jalapeno Popper, Windy City, Pickle fries, a creamy root beer float, and chili cheese fries. It was so good, we are back 2nd time in a week!!"}
{"text":"First time coming into this place and i was impressed. My husband and I were greeted by one of the owners Bob, he was very friendly and informative. He even cracked a few jokes about his wife turning 50 so with that being said happy birthday next week Jane!  We ordered the jalape単o popper dog, the Carolina slaw and chilli cheese fries. I must say the Carolina slaw dog was my favorite! Pulled pork on a steamie weenie with slaw and watermelon rind bbq sauce. The flavors were bold and they popped! My jalape単o popper dog was just as good, everything is good when you add cream cheese and jalape単o though in my opinion. Their Chile cheese fries were also delicious and just the right amount too. Our order was under 20 which you can't beat considering its lunch for two. I am looking forward to coming back and trying their other dogs!"}
{"text":"Great tasty loooonnnnggg hot dogs! Had the Windy City and Coney Style. Reasonable prices. Onion rings are very crispy! Large bottle soda selection...retro flavors! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We loved our first experience at Steamie Weenie!  We ordered the Trailer Park dog and the PBB&JJ dog, with sides of onion rings and fries, and two drinks.  Paid almost $20.  The flavor was good, the PBB&JJ was surprisingly delicious and extremely unique.  All served on locally baked hotdog buns, which were fresh and tasty!  The dogs themselves were flavorful and all beef.  We will go back to try more of their creations.

I do have some criticisms that prevent me from giving 5 stars.  (Actually, I'd give this a 3.5 rating because of these criticisms, but I rounded up because I like the dogs.)  For one, I think it is a mistake to upcharge for different styles of hotdog meat.  The menu items themselves are priced high enough that you should have the option to have a local link or an all beef dog or a brat for the same price.  I would love to try the local links but I'm not willing to turn my $7 hotdog into $8.  They only sell bottled beverages, and they add a hefty price to your total bill.  The basic sides, while inexpensive, are not good quality.  The onion rings were obviously frozen battered and the fries were also obviously frozen first."}
{"text":"Anyone can make a hot dog at home with the usual toppings, but if you want to try some good gourmet dogs, The Steamie Weenie is the place to go. I usually don't eat dogs unless I've got a beer in hand and I'm at a baseball game or picnic, but I was given a gift card and it was loaded up enough to get lunch twice for a party of two. Some of the hot dogs were unique that I haven't seen before and the service was really friendly from this family owned dog-themed restaurant on both of my visits.

If you manage to find parking, you can order at the counter once you enter and enjoy your dog at one of the high tops. The menu consists of some \"old dogs\", some \"new tricks\" or you can just custom build your own. They have fries as a side, but I wouldn't miss out on the tots if you're a fan. The loaded potato tots are topped just like a loaded baked potato with some extra crunch added from the fried, shredded taters. If the tots aren't enough of an accompaniment, you can have one of their house made dipping sauces or grab a soda from the cooler and drink it straight from the bottle.

You also can use the Eat 24 app for delivery, or for pick up, which is what I did on my second trip. My order was ready at the requested pick up time and nothing was missed. Out of the four dogs I tried, the Nor'Wester was my favorite with plenty of kick from the sriracha and jalapenos, sweetness from the grilled onions, and some tart from the cream cheese. The More Cowbell was my least favorite solely because the pulled pork was dry.

Steamie Weenie does proclaim that they use Nathan's and Vienna Beef, but when I hear \"hot dog,\" words like, \"processed,\" \"nitrates,\" and \"mystery meat\" pop in my head that give a negative connotation. I will still eat them occasionally and enjoy them. Although I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs, I am a fan of this locally owned business and will continue to support them whenever I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!! I had the BLT hot dog and it was incredible. The staff is so welcoming and kind! I had it for lunch and then went back for dinner!!! LOL It was absolutely delicious!!!!!! If you want a good hot dog, go check these guys out!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I love the weenies! 

Yes I went there. The name stuck in my head and I am glad it did. The food is delicious and great service. The location is clear from the street and you can't miss it once on green Valley Ranch. We went before closing so it was not busy.
I ordered the salchipappas $5 and it was steamy hot which was perfect for my craving. It's crinkle fries with hot dog pieces and steamie sauce. Yum yum!!
My husband got the baked potato tots $4.75 all I have to say about this is beer and cheddar cheese on top of tots! The little bit he let ke have was delicious. He also got the coney weenie $5.75. Not half bad. He enjoyed it but I'm just not a fan of chili on hot dogs. 
Overall, great experience and I will be back for happy hour for the floats"}
{"text":"Decided to order from here since i was stuck at work though uber eats, Im so very glad I did . Got the Chicago Style hotdog which was amazing.  Just missing the poppy seed bun to make it truly from home but the taste nailed it. 
Asked for a side of the beer cheese which was also amazing.  I will definitely be recommending and ordering again!"}
{"text":"Good food and super friendly workers! The dogs were tasty and loaded fries with hot dog bits and special sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great weenies! Great service! Love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"Great all-beef hot dogs made even better by wrapping in bacon! We had both the Tucson dog & Mac & Cheese w/ bacon wrapped dog and an order of Chili Cheese Fries. All very good!"}
{"text":"I got the \"Cheese Chili Cheese\" dog and a side of tots. Food was what I was hoping for and the staff was extremely friendly. Definitely the go-to for a great American Classic."}
{"text":"Locally owned restaurant with very friendly service. They serve Vienna Beef hot dogs which is great. They have a nice menu of classic dogs and gourmet dogs. They have a great selection for any hot dog fan. The other thing I love is their selection of bottled root beers and other sodas. I look forward to trying a different root beer every time I come. 
I hope this place does well for many years to come. It is nice to have a place in Henderson for a good dog! I would give the restaurant 5 stars, but it is a little pricey and I think the hot dog buns could be better (no poppy seed bun on my Windy City :/) But I will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"This place is so freaking delicious!! Got the cheese chili cheese dog. More cowbell dog and doggie style tats. Chili cheese was good. No wow factor. Exactly what you would expect. Hubby said the more cowbell was excellent and we shared the doggie style tats which was very good as well. Loved the sauce they use on them. Will definitely be back and would recommend any day. Prices we're good. 

The gentleman at the counter was very welcoming and personable!!"}
{"text":"Yummy little hot dog place, especially if you like all kinds of toppings like my husband does. For me I'm pretty basic. I tried a dog with some beer cheese and diced onions and tomatoes. It was good but could've been hotter. The cheese and dog were luke warm. Also the dogs are skinny and long. I would also prefer a beefier thicker dog but that's just me. 

My husband loved his Mt. Fuji dog and the Pushcart. He is already making his selections for the next visit. We also got the loaded tots which was amaze balls. I tried the steamie sauce on the side as well. 

Next time I'm gonna try the Mac n cheese dog. So, yes, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Just ordered this today, and wow they are good, so glad I have a new place to enjoy my hot dogs!!! So many options and cool toppings!"}
{"text":"This Dog place is really good, I got the Maxwell St and chili cheese fries. It was amazing! Also there cream soda by sprecfier is so good i recommend it. If your a lover of hot dogs I recommend this spot.
All I gotta say is. ITS Lit!"}
{"text":"I had the chili cheese dog which was great! I like that the chili didn't overpower the hot dog. It was a nice balance. My partner got the BLT dog and really enjoyed it. The owners were very nice, and the food was good. We will definitely go back to try the other unique options on the menu. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the lack of drink options is a bummer."}
{"text":"We couldn't decide between the PBB and JJ or Trailer Park... the owner suggested we try the PBB and JJ.  So, we went with that option.  All the flavors blended really well.  Couldn't really taste the bacon though... now that I have the menu, I can't wait to try my own concoctions at home!  And the tator tots were really good!  I like places that offer tots instead of regular fries."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 8-9-15 around 12:30 PM.  The restaurant is located south of Pebble on Green Valley in the Northwest corner of the shopping center that Smith's is in.  

The only drinks available are bottled.  There are only two regular tables and the rest are high-tops. The menu is painted on the wall.  They have one high chair for the kiddies.  

I got a plain hot dog, chili-cheese fries, and a bottled root beer for $13.05.  Pretty expensive but it might be worth it if you got one of the more exotic hot dogs. That's the only reason to ever return here, really.  

Peeves: 
1) The majority of my fries were completely raw in the middle.  I'm talkin' crunchy raw potato, folks.  It wasn't pretty.  
2) Cockroach in the corner.  Not a big deal, it can happen to the best of us.  Doesn't mean it's a dirty place.  But sweep it up for crissakes.  
3) The ketchup on the table was empty but the mustard was brand new.  They could have taken two seconds to take the safety seal off the mustard before putting it on the table, but not a big deal, either.  

If I ever go back it will be for one of the strange hot dogs.  The staff were very friendly and chatty, and the hot dog was very good."}
{"text":"The best experience from the moment we walked in the door until well after we left with full bellies and smiles on our faces.  The Dogs...best in the West!  The Loaded Tots were better than ever and love the ambiance.  Bob is so wonderful; friendly and genuine!  The Steamie Weenie is exactly why our family loves to support small businesses and this business will prosper because they are awesome!  The pricing is great too, affordable for our whole family and fun.  Steamie Weenie gets 5 stars from us and we will be frequenting this fantastic establishment...cheers!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that i am not particularly a fan of hot dogs, that being said, I still really enjoy this place. They serve tater tots and you just load em up with just about every topping imaginable from peanut butter, to bacon jam, to spam! So good (not necessarily that combo lol). I always get that salchipapas when I go here, which is right under $5 and a good portion of crinkle cut fries drizzled with fry sauce, topped with cheese and their all beef hot dog pieces. YUM! The owners are a really nice couple and make you feel welcomed. Definitely a great spot for a lunch break and who knows, maybe next time I might actually get a dog."}
{"text":"This place is as good as lunch time gets! I chose to go here to lunch one day because I was looking for food places nearby. Immediately the name caught my eye and what I saw briefly of the menu intrigued me. My boyfriend got the Maxwell classic dog and he loved it, I tried a bite and it had one of the best brats we've ever had in it. The only thing that would improve that dog would be to chop up the grilled onions versus the long slices, but it wouldn't stop us from getting it again. I tried the 9th Island and it was oh so ono! The spam could have been cut into smaller pieces (for easier eating and less falling off to floor) but the pineapple relish was the best! I don't know who provides their local made hot dogs, but they were very good and big! We also loved that they had all glass bottle sodas of different varieties because I am always up for trying ones I've never had.

Be sure to get the steamie sauce which is their watermelon rind BBQ sauce/mayo fry sauce. It is the perfect consistency and tastes great! I would gladly drive across town to come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Good people good food... Go for the bacon wrapped hotdog and add to your hearts content."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this place and I've got to say these were some of the best dogs we've had in a long time. I had the Cheese Chili Cheese dog and my partner in crime had the Coney. Both very good but the bomb was the loaded tater tots. EXCELLENT! We judge because that's what we do. And we do it well."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy a good hot dog. Not something I eat all the time but when I get a craving its a must have, and I'll go out of my way to get one. I've been to Steamie Weenie a couple times and I must say they absolutely delivered. Great Dogs with a plethora of toppings to choose from. I originate from Cali, so I love the bacon wrapped dog and add some grilled onions, mustard and ketchup. Reminds me of the street vendors outside of Staples Center after a Lakers game. Great sides, the baked loaded tots are a great choice and are more than enough to share as well are the onion rings. I also really like the old school bottled sodas they have instead of the fountain drinks. Nice touch to an already great hot dog experience. Best thing is that this is a small business run by a local husband and wife team. Bob is always there and greets everyone with a smile and is eager to assist you on your gourmet dog journey."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places we have been. Super fresh pickle fries which my girlfriend loved, and the service was quick, friendly, and attentive. Reasonably priced and super high quality. 

I'm so glad we found this place, and we will 100% be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. If you love wieners you must get one from here. Plenty options for toppings and they have the best beer cheese. I get some tots and a side of beer cheese and I'm set. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch for the first time and had an all beef bacon wrapped hot dog topped with Mac and cheese. Was so good that I questioned what I've been doing with my life and why I've never been here before."}
{"text":"I was motivated to try this place during yelp's Toys for Tater Tots event!
Nate recommends the Tucson (can be known as a Sonoran dog), and being that I lived there for years, that was my choice for a steamie weenie! I miss the Sonoran dogs from Tucson and this one was ok but was missing that key Southwestern flavor! The mustard was a bit much and I barely tasted the lime salsa. Perhaps a spicy red salsa would be much better. It had plenty of beans. 

The loaded potato tots were better than the dog, for me, and they were a pile of greasy goodness! The tots have lots of bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream and all the flavor! I hope the other 3 kinds of tots on the menu are this good! You can make a meal out of this dish for sure."}
{"text":"I knew my 100th review was coming up and was looking for something special. I never would have guessed it would be for hot dogs, but Steamie Weenie is definately worthy enough! 

Once again, thanks to Yelp, I found this new business just off the 215 and Green Valley Parkway in the Pebble marketplace. Steamie weenie is a locally owned business which I always try and support. It is decorated simple yet fun with dark wood floors and \"Steamie weenie\" spray painted on the wall. They offer not only gourmet hot dogs with interesting combinations of flavors but several sides as well as the coolest bottled soda collection I have seen. 

We were welcomed immediately as we walked in. They were happy to offer suggestions as it was our fist time. I went with the Carolina slaw dog and a side of tots. The Carolina dog has coleslaw, pulled pork, diced onions and their famous watermelon rind bbq sauce which is excellent. Everything went together really well. My only minor complaint was that I thought the actual hot dog got a little lost as it was on the smaller side. The tots were good but could have been crispier. 

I will definately be returning to try several other things on the menu such as the trailer park dog, onion rings, the mac n cheese and that pumpkin pie soda I saw. If your in the mood for a dog this is the place to go."}
{"text":"They have $2 weenie Wednesday's!! I love how you can customize the toppings, they have some out of this world combinations which I have yet to try. Only thing is that they don't have a soda fountain, and drinks are available only by the can or bottle. I do love their fry sauce! Their Asian inspired hot dog creation sort of reminded me of something I had in Hawaii. As far as for coming back, I definitely wil -if I am craving for hot dogs, although I think they should add more variety to their menu. The service was great and the place was clean also. So definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"A strong, and diverse selection of dogs is what first brought me in to try this place out, and the quality of their dogs, and the delectable loaded tots keep me coming back! It helps that the price is right, and that their selection of sodas is substantive!

If you can imagine a style of hot dog, these guys probably have it on the menu. We're talking Coney Islands, Chicago-style, Sonoran-style, and all done any which way you want with a good list of add-ons. They also have some interesting unique choices on the menu, with the mac & cheese & cheese dog being one of my favorites. 

Ask for the sides: the loaded tots are amazing, as are the salchipapas. Great place, and great price."}
{"text":"I love the flavor of the chili dog but it's never warm enough. The bun and cheese are where that should be. I'll be back but please get those items taken care of!"}
{"text":"Great service and quality food. 2 people will run $20-$25 and well worth it. Variety of speciality regional dogs and ability to custom toppings. Good kids option. Yum!"}
