{"text":"This restaurant is now at a new location, in the shopping plaza directly across from Alpine Pools on Route 8.
I like the new place much better, and during our last 2 visits, the place has been packed.
That being said, I have both good and bad to report.
The good:
-newer surroundings, good servers, clean restrooms.
-they finally figured out how to properly make a Joe's Special Pizza.  At the old location, a Joe's Special was never really a Joe's Special (crust was always too thin, and not as much cheese as the original from McKnight Rd).  Also, the regular crust pizza is pretty true to the original Monte Cello's.
It's a  pretty good bet to go with one of their pizzas.
-the shrimp in my dad's entree were huge, delicious, and appeared to be hand-breaded.
-wife said the eggplant parmesan was good.
-daughter said her spaghetti with meatballs/sausage was good.
-side salads, bread, and soups were pretty good.

Monte Cello's are franchised.  As such, I assume the owner of each particular restaurant is trained in the food prep of the original Monte Cello's.  Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they don't.

The bad:
-father in law got the fish sandwich with fries.  Fries were overcooked and served cold.
-stuffed shells were bleh.  Standard fare like you'd get at Costco.  Certainly didn't taste homemade.
-the lasagna was absolutely atrocious.  I tasted it and my daughter tasted it.  It tasted like something that had been in a freezer for about a year, absorbed the odors of all of the food around it, then was re-heated.  Terrible.  Worse than terrible.  We each took one bite and didn't eat the rest of it.  Stouffer's from your local grocer's freezer is ten times better than this stuff.

It took a really long time after we ordered to receive our entrees.  Certainly not the server's fault, though.  He was excellent.

I hope this place gets its act together with the freshness of some of the food.

I'll go back, but I'm sticking with the pizza for now."}
{"text":"Good service. Food is similar but a little different and more expensive than the one on 19 in Cranberry."}
{"text":"We usually get Joe's Pizza, White Pizza or Italian Hoagie.  All  are excellent.  Service is friendly and swift.  They seem to retain their servers.  All are friendly and efficient.  Lot of food for the money.  Their soup is very good.  Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Too much of an outdated 1970s retro garlic taste in the pasta sauce instead of it being spicy and flavorful as things became during the 1990s. Too many old lady cabbage and vegetable  soups. I went here on Fridays about 10 times and only 1 time was clam chowder served and only 2 times was fish served yet these items are are their Friday buffet menu.  Music is  revolting and hard to listen too. Pizza is good and meatballs are good and so it the fish and clam chowder if it is served. The food is good but not as good as the owners and cooks think. They need to make the sauce spicy not full of garlic and get rid of old lady cabbage soups and get some Mexican soups with chicken in them and clam chowder at least 2 days a week and fish every Friday not breaded zuccinni. I have found it better to go to Eat and Park up the street who have good soups and a good salad bar every day. The aura and customer service here is still stuck in the 1980s. There are plenty of other places to eat and this restaurant needs to welcome more people and stop hoping to get wealthy patrons only."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, and I have had nothing but terrible experiences with their service since they moved into their new location. The teenage girls who work there do not listen at all when taking orders over the phone. My order has been wrong literally every time. Food has also been forgotten entirely when I chose delivery. Find some competent employees before you have no customers left. I'm officially done with Monte Cello's."}
{"text":"Yes, this restaurant looks like a swiss chalet on the outside, and the banquet room of a 1980s era Holiday Inn on the inside, but its not bad at all!!!

There is GREAT Italian food and there is good Italian food.  The food at Monticello's is just pretty good.  The salad was totally lack luster and I wasnt expecting much.  My friend ordered the crab ravioli and I ordered the chicken madeira.  The main courses came out and they were both FANTASTIC.

The chicken madeira was good.  The chicken breast was cooked perfectly, well seasoned, and most importantly--it was NOT TOO SALTY.  It tasted like savory wine and I loved it.  My friends crab ravioli was excellent.  Its hard to put sauce on crab and not lose the flavor of the crab but they managed to do it.

Ou

You're not going to go broke dining here, and you dont need to dress up either--this is a casual family friendly restaurant with good food.  If you're shopping on McKnight Road and 
hungry, consider giving Monte Cello's a try!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Monte Cello's restaurant.   

I normally go to the one on Babcock but I was in the neighborhood and wanted pizza.  There weren't a lot of people in the restaurant and service was just ok.  The hostess wasn't the friendliest and didn't smile much.  

We ordered some fried cheese balls and a small pizza.  The cheese balls were empty however the pizza was up to par.  

Our waitress was very friendly and kept our drinks full.  That always wins me over.  

They seem to have a lot of takeout orders as well.  

Overall not my favorite Monte Cello's but if in the area we could stop by again."}
{"text":"Monte Cello's is hit or miss in my experience.  Their pizza is good, but doesn't stand out when there are so many great pizza places within a 20 minute drive.  But their seafood pizza is my favorite in the city, and always has a generous amount of shrimp and scallops.  The Italian dishes are good sized portions but fairly bland.  The last two times we ate in the restaurant, dishes were overcooked and had to be sent back to the kitchen.  My mother in law's lasagna was so clearly burnt that I couldn't believe it was even served.

It's a decent option to get a quick pizza for takeout, but I if you're looking to dine in somewhere there are plenty of better options nearby."}
{"text":"Well this Monte Cello's fails in comparison with the others. The service was not attentive or friendly. The food was OK. The prices are high considering the quantity you receive. We ate dinner there and left hungry. We will not return"}
