{"text":"ive always been a fan of bar food, but this place had a great variety of twists on typical bar menus.i decided on the big o burger it was juicy cooked perfect with grilled onion ,onion rings and chipotle mayo so good. had some cocktails left full and happy!!"}
{"text":"Its a PT's is nothing special. Unfortunately looking for a cool Irish bar."}
{"text":"Love this bar...the food,drinks and atmosphere are great. Jess is by far the best bartender in Vegas."}
{"text":"I miss Kavenaughs. PTs drained the love out of this place. The bartender during the day today is never at the bar and when she is she's eating on the side. She has a crappy attitude. This place used to be my favorite and I tried to give it a chance after the change over but it's not worth my money. Sean Patrick's are usually good spots too but this one falls short. RIP Kavenaughs."}
{"text":"Favorite bar EVER!!!! I've never hit as many jackpots at any other gaming bar. The staff is very good-looking, friendly and alert. Best waitress ever too (her name is Becky.) The food is amazing (a little of everything.) The regulars are what really make it. I've met some of my closest friends here and I would definitely call Sean Patrick's my home away from home. Come stop by (if your cool enough.)"}
{"text":"SO disappointed! I miss the old restaurant! We went on a Tuesday night at 6pm. Waiting 5+ minutes at a table in the (smoked filled) bar. Never greeted, never got menus, never got water, nothing. So we left! This was the second time we have tried it since the \"grand opening.\" Won't be trying again. We were really looking forward to having a going away party there in July, but with the lack of service we have gotten from them, we will find a different place."}
{"text":"I read through the other reviews and I have to say... I'm a little shocked. My experience was great! Both bartenders working were absolutely fantastic! The renovations are great and this place is much more updated and fun. The beer selection is great too which is always a plus in my book. Much better selection than the sister companies of PT's and Sierra Gold. Lots of TV's for sports fans and excellent food as well. Try the Jalape√±o Sliders... They are superb. And they have excellent Tots! Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I was NOT impressed when I visited. It was a slow Sunday night two weeks ago and it took at least 40 minutes for our food to come out. We had a party of 3, so that was a little ridiculous on a slow night. The food was okay, but not that impressive. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This is my first time there.  The food was very good.  As far as the drinks, I drink vodka on the rocks. When I ordered one drink of bar vodka at the bar after 8 pm  and was shocked when I was charged $6.50 a shot.  My boy friend had Seagrams and seven and was charged $5.75. We were  with a birthday party so just paid for it anyway.  I than ran a tab and ordered some food and a couple more drinks.  I was quite surprised when the same vodka rang out at $8.00 a shot.  Needless to say the waitress didn't get a very big tip."}
{"text":"I went in and had some lunch and drinks. The food was great and the bartender Megan was always smiling. She gave great service and made a killer Bloody Mary! Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"First time here since switch from kavanaughs. Most of the eating area is no longer there making for a very crowded people trying to find tables. Smaller portions of food overpriced drinks. Won't go back don't recommend"}
{"text":"Ever since the place changed to Sean Patricks we have had nothing but great experiences. The foods great especially the wings, Jessica and the other bartenders are attentive and quick. Love coming here."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Extremely poor service. Poor ventilation. Dirty tables everywhere! Obviously understaffed and the bartender was the worst I've ever had. She couldn't make a Manhattan and told my Irish father-in-law that the Guiness was \"from Las Vegas.\" It took forever to get our food, which was not up to PT's standards. Kavanaugh's went downhill towards the end, but even at its worst, it was way better than Sean Patrick's! I paid $8 for a cup of watery potato soup...and the potatoes were still crunchy. A drunk foul-mouthed woman also made the experience miserable. This place needs some serious help if they want to stay in business. I know they won't be seeing us again!"}
{"text":"I had heard that the Kavanaugh's had been sold and reopened as Sean Patricks, so I stopped into check it out.  I have to tell you, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered a steak breakfast and it was excellent.   All the breakfasts are 50% off, so the whole thing, cooked to order was around $6.50.  The coffee is delicious and the service was spectacular.  I was fortuinate enough to get a waitress named Vicky, who I believe should be training wait staff everywhere.  Very friendly and impeccable attention to my well being during the meal.  I have been telling everyone about this place and I normally don't get that excited."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, 15 minutes to get a drink. 35 minutes to get a burger. Pub and grill, i think not. Asked for malt vinegar for my chips, waitress offered me rice vinegar!! asked why do you not have vinegar,  her reply, we dont sell fish and chips!!. Do not recommend..."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch some football. It was so cold it was terribly uncomfortable to sit there. We ordered food so no choice but to wait for it. The fry bucket was ok (how can you mess up fries). The quesadilla was super bland. The guacamole was horrible.  The worst part was their gambling criteria. Me and my husband both put in $20. Then I put in an additional $20. Only 1 comped beer ..., WHAT!?? Really ?!?!?  I will NEVER gamble there again. What the hell is \"handle\"?"}
{"text":"What bartender tells a paying customer what he/she should and shouldn't drink without me asking. Then when I order a drink and he doesn't approve it. he won't get it for you and let you set there."}
{"text":"The place was empty,  I mean the bartender and us and a ghost town. I ordered a sandwich. It was just an okay sandwich and a small portion of fries, not nearly  great enough or big enough to warrent the $10 price tag. And the ice tea I ordered, unbelievable price of $3.00 I usually get beer cheeper than that.  Atmosphere sucked, food was less than average and the price was way too high.  No wonder this place  is deserted."}
{"text":"Sean Patrick's is our favorite bar! Amazing staff great food and great friends anytime we go in! Best service around and I love going here it's my local watering hole! Jessica is our favorite"}
{"text":"Loved the bar when it was Morrissey's and did not care for the change! Will only come in when Becky is here as she is the only one since Joe that understands customer service! She is a credit to the organization and every effort should be taken by management to keep her with the organization!"}
{"text":"There outside patio is cool.  Buffalo chicken sliders are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!  10 stars!!"}
{"text":"I don't know who Josephine is but I did wait 45 minutes not 25. It was not my change the waiter kept it was others in my party and  we had a party of 6 but besides the 3 people at the bar there was no one else there and we only ordered water to drink. The waiter came back one time in the 45 minutes. I had to go find him to get our food and have them pack it up because we had to get back to work.  I knew I was not getting fast food, but it should not have taken 45 minutes. If they are telling you there was 8 tables there they are not telling you the truth. We were all at the same table!  And what does my hair have to do with it?"}
{"text":"Just came back from this Sean Patrick's for the first time. The service was extremely horrible, sitting there I witnessed many people just come and go because of nonexistence of the bartenders that were working. Given it was a Saturday night at 11pm but there were 2 bartenders that could care less of the people that were there. I will not be back for a long time if ever. I'll just try the pts gold down the street or the Sean Patrick's location on n 5th"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! Always come in after work at night and the bartender Christi always has a smile on her face and truly makes me feel like family and always so comfortable! She rocks!"}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment regularly and love the staff and all of the regulars! Food is great and no matter who's behind the bar it's a good time!"}
{"text":"So I came in for lunch and ordered the  meatloaf special and OMG it is tasty. It even comes with Irish soda bread. The bartender told me the meatloaf was going to be on their new menu. I guess their new menu will be out around November 1. She said it should have a lot of new exciting Irish items on it. Can't wait"}
{"text":"Pretty cool atmosphere, very mellow and chill. Our first time, waitress was pretty new... service was a little slow but food was good. Gotta come for happy hour specials."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a calm and relaxing environment where you can just get away from the world for a bit, Sean Patrick's on north 5th is the place to go. I have just had the best bar experience I have had in a long time.   The service was phenomenal, Nicole our bartender was personable, knowledgeable, and fun to spend time with.   The food...oh god the food...it was...there are no words. I had the corn beef sliders and my boyfriend had the fish and chips. The only complaints we had were that I wished I could eat more and he wanted more. What more can be said about this place? It's got a great intimate feel, the kind you want in a local bar, the kind you want in one that claims to be an Irish pub, and I strongly believe Nicole had a lot to do with that feeling.   I plan on coming back many more times!"}
{"text":"best local bar in Vegas. No matter the time of day I'm always greeted by a friendly bartender or server! plus they have Boddingtons on tap! Food is good and they have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I called in an order to pick up and was told it would take 20 minutes. When I got there the manager Amelia told me they were out of the cream for one of my orders. I then ordered the steak and Guinness pie. I decided since I now had to wait at the bar I would play the machine to pass the time. The manager Amelia who was working behind the bar the entire time did not ask me if I wanted a drink the extra 20 minutes I waited. My food was finally brought out and I left. When I got home I could not believe the size of the steak & Guinness pie it was in a small bowl this was suppose to be a dinner for $12.99 and the meat was full of fat. The buffalo sliders were terrible as was the philly steak. I was so displeased I called back and then took it back and received my $40 refund. As bad as the food was I still cant believe I was not even offered a drink while I waited and played the machine."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. Food was good overall. Corned beef is better than their fish and chips."}
{"text":"This place has a nice feel like your in your own living room touch. You can sit on the couch in front of the fireplace, watch TV, and eat your food right on the coffee table in front of you. The menu has a huge variety of choices, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The breakfast is served 24hrs a day, with specials to choose from. You are greeted as soon as you walk through the door by Rachel, she makes you think and feel like you just showed up to her house with a warm family welcome. She makes Johnny on the Spot seem slow.. She never let our glasses run close to being dry. Sat down next to us and told us about the specials and what her favorite items were on the menu. Awesome attitude.. Made you feel like you where a VIP and they are happy to see you like old friends. The food was fresh.. Tasted right off the grill.. Seasoned just right.. And the portions would make a hungry man proud and ready for a nap afterwards! Highly recommended if you are or not on a budget. Prices are very decent for the working person not looking to spend a fortune for a good meal."}
{"text":"I love Sean Patrick's and spend a good amount of money there, however they are not allowed to play county music which is ridiculous. Love the bartenders Christi Megan Amelia Jessica"}
{"text":"We decided to pop in for breakfast today. I had the corned beef hash and my wife had country side breakfast. Both plates were around $11, but they have a 1/2 price breakfast happy hour between 6 and 10am. Coffee was $2.50.  It was dissapointing to see canned corned beef hash on the plate when it arrived... in an Irish bar... that has corned beef on the menu... meh.  My eggs were cooked well, no complaints. The seasoned potato disks were a little wierd... unappetizing, but tasted better than they looked. The corned beef hash tasted off, I think the cook used oil from the deep fryer when he warmed it up on the flat top and it had some burned chunks of something in it. Canned corned beef has enough fat that it can be cooked without adding oil in my opinion.   My wife said her eggs, sausage, and potato disks were ok, but her toast was burnt.  The bartender was very friendly, refilled my coffee regularly, and asked about the hash still on my plate when she cleared the table. She is the reason I am giving them a solid 2 star rating.  The PT'S brand used to offer really good food at reasonable prices, but it seems like their prices have gone way up while the quality of the food has gone down. I imagine they are busy during their happy hours when several items, including their $20++ pizzas, are half price, but I couldn't imagine paying full price for the meals they served today."}
{"text":"Bartender gets mad at you if your upset, asks you to leave because of such things! I always thought they would be the one person you could go to. I guess I need to go home to Australia where they fkn care"}
{"text":"There was a waitress there, whose name I will not mention, who was absolutely, beyond a reasonable doubt, rude to me, my brother and our friends. We addressed the issue with a female bartender just before we left but I feel it was for nothing. I hope in the near future someone will address her customer service problem/skill because that place is no longer getting my business..."}
{"text":"Can I give less than 1 star? The worst service you can possibly imagine from the bar staff.  Poor ventilation and an all around miserable time.  The few people, an I mean few, who actually seem to care about there jobs are highly overshadowed by the majority of people working there that play a favorite or two and let you wait 30 minutes for a drink! Stay away if you actually want to have a drink."}
{"text":"This place was the terrible. We were there for over an hour before we received our food and the appetizers came out with the course. It took forever to have a waitress even take our drink order and then 15min later we received our drinks. So bad! We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Can't complain but we don't like dark. It has bar atmosphere which we don't care for plus it was outrageously expensive. $40 for two people without booze."}
{"text":"Amelia, Jessica and Creig are the sexiest bar tenders in town!!!! The waitress Megan's pretty hot too!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously will never go back. Stopped in to have lunch with my family and friends and they have a very small (tiny) dining room with no walls between it and the casino/bar. Heavy smell of smoke. When asked if there was another place to sit away from the smoke the waitress/barmaid said no. Told us we actually need to leave as we had our under 21 (17 & 15) year old kids with us. This place used to be pretty decent before it was Patrick's. But not anymore. In all fairness though we did miss the sign outside the entrance that states 21 and over only. This isn't like the other better bar and grills in town, where you can grab a great burger with the family. With Only 1 other person in there at the bar, I can't see this place doing good. We won't be back as I CANNOT stand to be forced to breath someone else's nasty 2nd hand smoke as I try to enjoy my meal. Way to many other better places out there to waste my money here."}
{"text":"Local bar. Good food food prices. Kinda slow service. They also have golden tee and private rooms for parties"}
{"text":"First couple of times experience was good...best pizza I have had in my neighborhood so far...service is bad..one waitress will let you have happy hour pizza price on take out and the other won't...over priced if not"}
{"text":"Its a seat yourself restaurant and pub but the food is great. I recommend the guineas sandwich, though I've tried their Shepherd's pie, nachos, and the big o burger; that sandwich is what stands out. The wait staff is always friendly and helpful, thought if you come in the day they often have their hands full with the bar patrons. Its a bit dark and hard to see, and there isnt a bar menu which is the only reason I'm not able to give the place a five star rating."}
{"text":"My husband and I first went to Sean Patrick's on Tuesday night and we were really happy that we had stopped. The food was great and our server was friendly and attentive. We had both ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, mine with French fries and his with coleslaw. We were there during happy hour so my wine was half price. Tonight, four nights later, we decided to stop in again during happy hour and have something to eat on our way home from Christmas shopping. Wow, what a difference! My husband again ordered the grilled chicken sandwich because he liked it so much the first time, but tonight it had no seasoning on it and it was served on a hamburger bun instead of a sandwich roll and the coleslaw was very dry. I ordered the Reuben sandwich with onion rings. The corn beef was dry, salty and tough. I liked the onion rings but they were heavily battered. Our server was pleasant but seemed a bit overwhelmed even though there were not many people in the place. If we had been served this meal on Tuesday night, we would not have gone back. We will try Sean Patrick's one more time on a week day and hope the cook from Tuesday night is there!"}
{"text":"Love the service love the place! Happy hour is the best! Wish it was a little longer cuz of my schedule.. Music.. Classic rock! 5 stars :) gean always has the best conversations.. I come in stressed out from my retail job.. Leave happy n relaxed:) great place to chill n have a few! I dont play the games much but i do see people win! N win big! Sean Patricks.. I love this pub!"}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was kavanaughs and always loved it here! Now owned by PTs and it's still great! They offer an amazing happy hour and still kept some of the same staff as the original owners. The bartenders are always great and I love that they offer Irish food still and not just the typical pts menu. Guinness on tap is always poured perfectly which seems to be a hard task at some bars here in town! I'd recommend this bar to all of my friends and always enjoy the experience here"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, always very relaxed atmosphere when we come. Food is delicious and bartenders are always very nice. Kyle is the man! I have made this bar my usual spot for the last couple of months and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Great drinking spot with friendly people, especially the bartenders. Shout out to Amelia, Becky and Jess - bomb.com girls, always attentive and talkative. Games do pay, you just have to be strategic based on the jackpot posting. Good bar food!"}
{"text":"Sean Patrick's is a fun, PT's owned, Irish bar. The food menu isn't great, but Becky the Bartender is AWESOME!!  Make a point to come here when she is working, you won't regret it!  They have 16 beers on tap, and a full bar with a nice array of Irish Favorites."}
{"text":"What an awesome place this is! You can actually sit in front of the fireplace on the couch while watching tv..and have your breakfast lunch or dinner. It's just like being at home. . You are greeted as you walk through the door by Rachel as if she's known you forever. She never let our glasses get dry and took the time to tell us about specials and what was good to order. She really makes you feel like long lost friend and a VIP. You can tell she really enjoys her job. Their food was fresh and you can tell it came right off the grill. And the portions would make a hungry man happy and ready for a nap afterwards! Definitely right up there next to home cooking.  Being a working man..I really appreciated the fact it didn't cost me a fortune to dine there. Their prices are definitely decent. Highly recommend this place. .well worth it to have great service.. great food. .great prices."}
{"text":"P T took over this small chain of bars. They took out the dining rooms making them not available to families any longer . Took out the original menu and the Morrisey Melt which was my favorite and replaced the menu with standard PT's food.  I did have the Club wrap which was quite good. Football was on TV but the satellite feed kept going out . Bartender Joe was personable and there with a refill when requested . Kind of just another PT's now."}
{"text":"Praise Jebus. So glad PT's bought this place. The facility is cozy and the outdoor area is great. Came here a couple times when it was under original ownership and resolved to not return until competent management took over; PT's definitely knows how to run a pub so we're back.  The place isn't very 'Irish' but it is a vast improvement and we're looking forward to spending time on the patio this summer."}
{"text":"Extremely good customer service and the food was awesome!!! Can't wait to come back next Mother's Day and enjoy it with family and friends this time."}
{"text":"First time here since becoming Sean Patrick's. An \"Irish\" bar playing country music. Don't expect to get served quickly unless you're at the bar gambling. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to come here once in a while when it was Kavanaugh's. it was meh  But now they have done a hell of a job changing the place. the food is what i come to expect from a PT's gold or Sierra gold. same menu for the most part.  Guinness steak sandwich and corned beef keeps me coming back. depending on the staff the service will vary, its always decent but if the bar tender is swamped with tables and the bar, service will not be 4 stars maybe 3. bar tenders are cute and thats a must for these places ;)  angry orchard, stella, blue moon, guiness on tap keeps me and my friends happy. black and tan onion rings on everything please. corned beef slider bucket or jalapeno sliders are a must.   i always put at least a $20 on the machines and i at least get a free drink, other places require you to max bet the whole time even if you spent $100, so thats a plus. managers are all friendly. the place is a bar if someone lights up a cigar they turn up the fans or open the door for me during the day.  if you like pts gold or sierra gold you will feel at home with an irish twist that keeps me coming back to this location, even tough there are both a pts gold and sierra gold near by!"}
{"text":"Well been here the past had really good fish and chips. Second visit not as good third visit horrible. Was in the area thought would give it one last try! Never again, had the fish sent back to replace with a burger which tastes freezer burnt! NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"If anyone was going to be upset that this was no longer Morrisseys it was going to be me; I was up here often; I'm a creature of habit, and I don't normally do well with change. So when I walked in soon after the grand opening of 'Sean Patricks' I was sad that the dining area had become a \"pool hall\" which includes a pool table, shuffle board and tables with a couple big screen TV's (horrible right)  the bar area lost some of the irish decor and I saw a couple new bartenders- that was it,  I immediately decided I wasn't going to like it up here anymore and that my favorite spot was a thing of the past- Until..... I gave it a chance and boy am I pleasantly surprised by the new changes. Let's start with Happy Hour, yes people happy hour, a real half off entire bar (no matter what you're drinking) happy hour from 5-7 which includes some food items which btw ok the menu does have typical PT's items on it but it also has the irish food that was once offered on the Morrisseys menu. The environment is no different than it was before except its more upbeat with patrons who are happy to be happy during happy hour or even off happy hour who are happy that sucker comes full circle at midnight until 2am   You're right, the dining room is gone which doesn't allow families to eat there anymore but it did become a full adult bar that you can shoot some pool with your friends and enjoy happy hour.  The food is good, the rueben is outstanding.  The bartenders are happy and upbeat and the cocktail waitresses are friendly as well. Over all the new location isn't exactly the PT's owned you think it is. It's a bought out Morrisseys now called Sean Patricks that got a little nip and tuck, something I think you too will find as a pleasant surprise!   Tv's are on sports all the time;music isn't too loud; ambiance is kicked back or elevated depending on the energy you bring; I gave it 4 stars that extra star is  for  happy hour!"}
{"text":"I have been twice since the remodel. The first time the waiter talked three of us into getting Guinness steak sandwich. All the sandwiches were cold, I decided not to eat it, the other two guys sent is back and they microwaved them. The second time we got \"philly\" sandwiches and they must have spilled a pepper caster on the sandwich. Two visits both sandwiches were bad so I will pass on a third visit."}
{"text":"Food horrid, service was ok.  Even though it was comped from my play at PT's I wouldn't eat here again.  I was told that they make everything, yeah right out of a can it was horrible and for 9.00 you can get something out of a can for $0.50 that would taste better at Smith's just down the street.  Oh well lesson learned."}
{"text":"I think the only time me and my man will come here is when Kyle is working. We stopped by around 6:30pm for happy hour and after waiting patiently the server returned to tell us that they are out of the beer that he picked. Then my man picked another one and she returned again to say that they are out of that beer as well, so then he ended up picking a different type of beer that he has never tried. Unfortunately he did not like it and returned the beer to the bar. He asked politely for a Guinness beer with a discount after waiting over 30 min for a beer and the server (Audrey) rudely said \"NO\" with an attitude."}
{"text":"Sarah was amazing! Best service I have had in a long time. The food was fast and delicious. Sarah made sure to let our table know when happy hour hit, she also told us the specials going on. I definitely will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The husband and I just had some BOMB fish & chips at Sean Patrick's. Well, the fish was bomb. I'm not a fan of seasoned French fries, especially with fish - it just doesn't make sense to me. The coleslaw was clearly not fresh, so I didn't touch the tartar sauce - but the fish - oh the fish! The cod was slight and flaky wish an intense crisp to every bite. The batter was so thin you barely noticed it, except for the beautiful crunch. Light, well-seasoned and begging me to come back for more, it was.   We sat outside on the patio, the oversized chairs and tables were comfortable but a bit large for just two...would be perfect with a group of friends. The waitress was very friendly and rushed to get our happy hour order in before the time period ended in five five minutes - which was awesome, $3.50 for a Jameson and ginger? Yes please!   I'm leaving off a full star because when we walked in it was very confusing as to if we set ourselves or not. Also for it being a relatively new building, it smelled like people have been smoking in there for at least 40 years.   We'll be back for that fish. It delighted our tastebuds for sure. We'll make it between 5-7 any day of the week to catch that happy hour, too!"}
{"text":"Awful place bartender was rude, & they don't serve Irish food its chicken wings & pizza???"}
{"text":"This the greatest place ever! The service is second to none and the bar ladies are great. I frequent this place often and it's never let me down from the drinks to the food completely great place. I bring all kinds of people to this bar and I always leave with people telling me they will go back any bad comments against this bar should b ignored they are great fair and full of fun and excitement all the time"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. We have been waiting nearly 15 minutes for a drink. The bartender seems to help and talk to all the regulars and continually walks past us sitting here with empty galsses. Finally we received some service as I am writing this. I received poor service here before and decided to give it a second chance and again bad service."}
{"text":"The oil in their fryer needs changing.  I ordered fish and chips,  the fries were delicious and well-seasoned. The fish was the color of a chocolate bar.  Sorry,  that was a first.  Coming from California, that dish is common. We even had an H.Salt Fish&Chips, which the color was golden and not chocolate brown.  Bartender was nice, I ordered a signature drink and it was tasty. I will return and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Worst St.Patricks experience ever.  How hard is it to serve good corned beef and cabbage? The meat was tough and the cabbage was tasteless. My friend did enjoy her Shepherd's pie. Only 4  items offered on the menu. Our meals are served on paper plates with plastic silverware and cups. Had a couple of whiskey shots that were poured short. We were also stuck in a back room with folding tables and chairs. Don't know why, they weren't full. Very disappointing. No enticement to stay, left early and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sean Patrick's has been taken over by the PT/Sierra Gold group. This place, waaaay out in North-town used to be just a restaurant, and a mediocre one at that. I'd been here once before and it was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  They've renovated into a pub/grill with a room for billiards, and they have an outdoor patio which was being used for some social party/gathering while my husband and I were there.  Come for happy hour and you'll get the best bang for your buck. After all, the food menu here is nothing great. You can get pizzas and pub-grub, primarily consisting of items they bring out to you in bucket form. Novel concept, I guess - I even noted they will bring you out a bucket of sliders. Downside: the pricing is outrageous for a pub setting so I would not eat here on the regular.  Happy hour pricing is the best - 1/2 off all drinks. Yes, ALL DRINKS. My husband and I had the following: 2 shots of Jameson, 1 Carona, 3 Vodka crans, and one Chocolate Cake shot - plus we had a pizza with two toppings, our total for all of this was $28.97. That is a steal. That is the cheapest meal and drinks I've had in Vegas in a VERY long time.  Only downfall - the happy hour food menu only includes their pizzas which are cardboard style monstrosities that only receive the name \"pizza\" because that is what they resemble.  Come for the drinks. Leave to go eat."}
{"text":"Love to get take out from here! The philly is my favorite! The prices are pretty high for a bar though. Machines are pretty tight! All in all, a nice, cozy atmosphere & great to wind down. Mainly get food here"}
{"text":"Happy St Patrick's Day...or not. Was excited to celebrate the day today but when we walked in the bartenders were complete sour puss's. Nobody was there, understandably, if everyone is met with this attitude. Our server turned the experience around though and made us smile. We still won't go back but props to him at least!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood bar. It's like cheers where everyone knows your name. Feel like home. Wait staff is awesome. Prompt and friendly keeps your drinks full. Meat Sarah tonight she is great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Jess, Amelia, and Sarah are awesome!  The service you receive here is fantastic! The food is amazing! I definitely recommend the corn beef sliders and drunken potato skins OMG!! This is our new favorite hang out from now on!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, great food, fantastic service and a fun atmosphere.  Sarah has taken care of me the last two times and she is awesome."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time and it was nice. Not packed at all, well-appointed bar and grill and excellent service from friendly staff. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off, our bartender was AMAZING! I work in the industry so the fact that someone understands our schedules & the industry... very pleased. Came in here late at night after work. I work at a nightclub so, I have ridiculous hours. Not only was he super attentive but, very social! I actually don't like people who talk to me constantly but, he had just the right amount sass & social understanding! His music taste was on point! His name is Alec! So much fun!!!!Thank you sooo much Alec!!!! You're my new favorite! Not easy to get that kind of review from a bartender herself.  10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND!  Again, coming from a bartender who worked on the strip. Thanks for serving us!!!!!! So awesome!"}
{"text":"Skip it. Maybe we got them on a off day, but the food was wrong, it took over an hour to get us the food. Good news is they compd us the meal. Who puts sugar on fries anyway?"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last week with a gift certificate I won from the radio. I found out that it used to be Kavanaugh's, but it is now part of the same chain as PT's and Sierra Gold. The menu was pretty similar if not identical to that of PT's and Sierra Gold.  I had the buffalo medium chicken wings, and I'd have to give it 2 thumbs up! The wings were super tasty and juicy! They were not dripping with sauce and instead were a little crispy which I absolutely LOVED. I was craving the wings days later and went to PT's and ordered it, thinking it was the same - and it was not! I will definitely go back to Sean Patrick's again just for the wings!"}
{"text":"We went early on St. Patrick's day.  We sat outside and were given a ton of amazing service.  The shepherds pie was awesome, the potato soup in a bread bowl YUM! I wish I had  the names of everyone who works there to let them know we appreciated it all."}
{"text":"My previous review stands; however after being forced to go back to celebrate a friend's birthday, I missed something when I record last......the prices! They are astronomically inflated and incredibly expensive for the bare bones, less than top shelf alcohol they DO have.... The food is still really good and so is the shuffleboard, but I'm not giving this place my entire check so they can stock up on Maker's Mark and I can play unlimited hours of shuffleboard."}
{"text":"Formerly known as Kavanaugh's, PT's now has ownership over this former chain of Irish Pubs and has dubbed all four locations \"Sean Patrick's\". I was eager to check out the \"new\" Kavanaugh's. The transition to new ownership is marked by an emphasis on the pub part of the establishment - the former dining area now has a pool table and a brand new shuffle board. Sean Patrick's is less restaurant focused as evidenced by the disappearance of dining tables. The menu has been streamlined and although there are still a few Irish classics, the menu decidedly reflects it's new PT's parent. There's plenty of pizza, wings, and fries to go around.  I ordered the Taco Salad and ordered it as a wrap ($9.99). My husband ordered the pretzel bites ($8.99). The food's a bit pricier than I would like for bar food, but everything we ordered was great! The pretzel bites are excellent for sharing - they came on a good size plate with 3 rows. The wrap and fries were plenty enough for 2, and we were both full at meal's end. The total bill for an appetizer and wrap came to around $22 before tip.   I'm not sure if the employees were transitioned or replaced with the PT acquisition, but the service could use some improvement. At first it seemed to be a problem of being understaffed, but it soon became apparent the problems ran deeper than that. Our server provided average service (there's a difference between restaurant service and bar service) with our table, and we were fine with that. We did see, however, one customer who was dining in another area walk up to the bar with two empty cokes in hand and wait for refills. Shortly after another guy from the same area walked up to the bar and waited to pay his check. On top of this, the one waitress on duty was sitting at the bar busily chatting with a friend who had walked in. Again, no huge problems with our service but it was clear other customers were unhappy. Bar problems. Where's Jon Taffer?   Overall, the grub is good and the service is okay. I'll be back to play some shuffleboard!!"}
{"text":"Goodbye family friendly cordoned off dining area, hello shuffleboard and pool table! I have to say, I like that under PT's new ownership, Sean Patrick's now has a game room. What I don't like is the dismantling of everything Irish in the bar. :(   I digress. I came in for Happy Hour right at 5PM. HH is everyday, from 5PM to 7PM and 12AM to 2AM. All drinks and pizza are 50% off, with (very) select appetizers for $5.   GILROY 16' PIZZA ($9 HH): Why is this pizza so dang salty? Me and the hubs were confused as to why the pizza tasted overwhelmingly like salt. There's no mention of salt on the menu in the item description. My husband confirmed that the Gilroy served at the Ann Rd. location is NOT salty. Very perplexing.    PRETZEL BITES ($5 HH): The only vegetarian appetizer on the HH menu. Served with sides of honey mustard and nacho cheese. IMO, bites tasted better with the mustard! Husband said the nacho cheese tasted \"chemical-y\".   BEER ($3 HH): A giant beer mug of Coors Light that's I think 24 oz.  VIBE: Pretty dead on a Sunday evening. The main bar area smelled like smoke so we opted for the outdoor patio. The music playing was horrid and should NEVER be played at an Irish bar. Alicia Keys and Cee-Lo? No thanks. To make it worse, the music was super dated.   Worth a Return Visit? Yes, but only for Happy Hour! Total for two came to $21.47 pre-tip. Not bad for 2 beers, an appetizer, and a pizza that we're going to nosh on later for leftovers!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #46"}
{"text":"Came here the other night. Was my first time. Was football night and there was a few people there. Mainly at the bar so I sat at a table just in front of the bar. I was greeted within about a minute or two. I wish I had got the girls name because she was good. Order a large Stella with the Big O burger medium rare. Drink was brought to me right away and the burger and fries took about 10 minutes or so. Burger was $11.99. Menu said it came with caramelized onions which to me is grilled onions but it came out with two deep fried onion rings on it. I didn't really care for the onion rings. I would have rather had grilled onions but the food came out hot and didn't take too long. Burger was done exactly how I liked it and it was very juicy but I think the burger should be $9.99 instead. The waitress checked up on me every few minutes or so which is what I was pleased with. I will give this place a try again sometime. I used to come here when it was kavanaughs and they didn't really change the place much at all when the PT'S chain took it over."}
{"text":"Third time not a charm.  Decor hasn't changed much, dusty shelves where alcohol bottles used to be. How can an Irish bar not know what a shandy is?  Also never been to an Irish bar that solely plays country music. Every single time I've been in. It's now a running joke with my friends-see if we can catch something other than slow country music at this bar.  Won't be back though..."}
{"text":"Looks good inside and food was good.  If you PT's menu you will love this place!  The sever was cute  and was right on top of every thing!"}
{"text":"While on our way to the Las Vegas Comic Con, we decided to grab breakfast. Based off our experience, I here is our opinion of our experience.  High level - Upon arrival, there was only one car in the parking lot, so I was thinking, was this place closed? However once we entered, there was only one other customer. So we basically were able to sit wherever we wanted to. First impressions is this location, from the sound of it, I was expecting more of a Irish feel, however felt like I was in normal PT's bar, but not complaining as the inside was very nice and seems to be well maintained.   Service - with only my wife and I and one customer, we were well taken care, however one thing I did like, is the bartender was very laid back, very chill and very friendly. We didn't wait long for our order and our glasses were never empty.   Food - my wife ordered the breakfast burrito and I had a build your own ham and cheese omelet. We both agreed that the food quality and taste was very good. I felt like the food was brought out as soon as it was finished cooking. The potatoes were also very good and seasoned well. The menu is basically bar food and traditional breakfast fare, but was really good.   Conclusion - We look forward to our next visit and would like to try lunch and dinner. So why only 4 stars since I had no complaints? I wonder how things would be if the restaurant was busier?   I just think this place could be one where you walk in and everybody knows your name, and they always glad you came, get it?"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, okay beer selection. Layout and selection is identical to the Southern Highlands location."}
{"text":"Good food. Good bar tenders. lots of tvs. Golden tee for golf arcade entertainment. slot machines on fire!! always paying out jackpots. Highly recommend this bar for great service & food."}
{"text":"Love this place, not alot of people and always a very attentive bartender. Food has always been awesome and the gambling is ok. What more can you ask for. First place I took my brother after he just flew in. I'll keep going back and I'd recommend it to everyone. Check this Irish themed local bar out, it rocks."}
{"text":"I'm all about service. I was greated fairly quick when I sat down by the bartender but then it all went down hill from there.  Really cool atmosphere but the girls working are terrible. I had 4 different servers. Every time I went to ask for another beer or order food, the girl I spoke to said let me get your server!. Wtf? I'd like to have a server.  Then it took us forever to get our check.  This place will not last unless they get better servers who pay attention to their tables. If it's the managers, don't stretch them so thin they can't give tables what they need, or train them properly.  Disappointed previous reviews were right."}
{"text":"Stopped in this afternoon after watching the Cleveland Indians clinch the AL pennant!   Used to be our \"go to\"bar when Kurt was there.  Noticed it going down hill after he left.  Stopped in occasionally (out of convenience and location)over the last 5 years.   Has reached an all time low, however, these days.  Although the bartender was pleasant enough, it was not enough to ever get us back.   Too much to go over in this format.   Just heed my advice and save your money and time."}
{"text":"Great steak sandwich with Guinness sauce.  Smoking and non smoking area.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Great place for food and drinks. Always has small crowds (which I like) and a nice outside beer garden."}
{"text":"It used to be Kavanaghs. PT's has not improved it at all. With all the experience at PT's you'd think they know what they are doing. Customer experience is important and they could care less.  All tables are high-top bar tables. That is not a comfortable way to sit for a meal. The manager was there and did not even come over and welcome us. He should have, especially opening a new place. The table shuffleboard doesn't do anything for the place. Booths! Improve the seating! Thanks for nuthin Sean Patrick."}
