{"text":"Great Irish bar we found walking the streets of Toronto in a snow storm.  Wasn't busy at all.  Quaint bar with a very friendly bar tender.  Guinness was poured well.  I had the pulled pork burger which was very tasty!  Lots of TV screens mean this place would be a good venue to watch a game.  If I'm still in Toronto for the Super Bowl I will most likely come here as I think it will be busy and on asking they already have 50 people booked for tables.  One suggestion would be that they get a TouchTunes Jukebox.  I like to be able to choose the music that's playing and the 80's hits that we're playing got a bit boring"}
{"text":"The service is great! Tons of tv to watch sports! Food is a mix review - I'd recommend the Irish nachos and wings but the onion rings are the worst. I believe they charge cover after a certain time but we got their early to watch the UFC fight. Overall, great neighbourhood pub!!"}
{"text":"This place has the most dishonest staff. We arrived in this completely desolate bar on a Friday night at 7pm. The waitress convinced us to stay for a beer and said we could go up stairs to the rooftop patio called The Porch. Then when we got there they did it was a ten dollar cover. What a joke it was already getting dark... This place is a dive bar at club prices do not come here."}
{"text":"This is a nice classic Irish pub. Nothing to too different from other Irish pubs. That being said it is always a great time and they have a good selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Restaurant is ok. They had a buffet the day we went which we weren't aware of prior to making our reservations. Music was unbelievably loud that it was impossible to have a convo without screaming. However, our waitress Alaine (I think that was her name) was so awesome and just so attentive. She really went out of her way to go the extra mile. 

I wouldn't come back to the restaurant but I'd come back to The Porch."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game and enjoy a some beers! The bartenders are friendly and you can take a break from the bar to play some pool, darts or ping pong."}
