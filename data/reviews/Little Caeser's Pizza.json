{"text":"Usually a great place but this trip they would not except a 50 dollar bill because the worker said the manager would get pissed if she made 20 dollars in change? Paid debit to get food then took 20 minutes to get food."}
{"text":"They NEVER have pizza ready! Workers are rude. And they wait time is way more than what they tell you."}
{"text":"Sucks. Bad parking lot. Hard to get in and out. No parking. Rude staff. Long waits. Crazy bread is unseasoned and no butter. The one on recker rd and brown is better"}
{"text":"A $5 pizza isn't anything special but it's reliable. Always the same, cheap, and fast. Ordered for afternoon pick up and everything ran smooth and the pick up was fast."}
{"text":"For a cheap pizza that tastes good with ZERO wait time... can't beat this place.  I can't believe people still buy frozen pizzas with there hot n ready price where it's at.  PIZZA PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to get some breadsticks, but couldn't even order. Two or three people in the back. I didn't get a greeting or a \"just one minute\"  after about 5 minutes I walked out. Unbelievable service, never going there again"}
