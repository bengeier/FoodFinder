{"text":"Excellent food... Great prices.... Amazing service. They were out of a side I ordered and the cook,  Jack, personally came out to apologize and custom made me a side to replace it. You never see that. 

Bartender,  Babs, was super sweet and very attentive to all patrons. My guy friend who joined me also didn't mind that she was easy on the eyes :) 

I'm not a  smoker and was disappointed all West View bars allow smoking but the ventilation here is great and you can't tell. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar. The food is great. The drinks are cheap.It has big flat screen TV's everywhere. This is the best place to watch all Pittsburgh sports teams. They also give away an authentic Steelers jersey after every regular season and playoff game. As long as you are there by the end of the first quarter, you will have a chance to win. Now that's awesome!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason they don't get 5 stars is the smoke. The food is the best bar food I've ever had in my life. The chicken salad is unmatched and the wings are excellent especially after a few draft beers. Their specials are amazing, especial during sporting events, and their bartenders are the friendliest around. Try this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food. Decent happy hour and very friendly people. The owners are great!"}
{"text":"George is the one of the best bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of serving me! That warm inviting smile, and generous nature make me want to become a regular!"}
