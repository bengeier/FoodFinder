{"text":"I sure was happy when this Daddona's opened up on the west side!  I have eaten in and gotten carryout several times.  Never have I been disappointed.  The atmosphere tries to be mellow and relaxing, with dim lighting and a green/purple scheme, which is nice, but some of the artwork doesn't really seem to fit.  It's not very big, but it's not crowded either.  The booths are quite comfy but if you're at a table the chairs are hard and a tad on the small side if you're not tiny.  Also, it's always cold.  I have learned to take a sweater along, which is a little annoying in warm weather.  Also, there's no bar like the Solon location, but stay anyway!    Start with the garlic bread bites, but be careful, they are like crack.  One bit and you're hooked!  Then on to the menu... pretty tradtional Italian fare.  The menu is large enough to have a good selection, but not overwhelming and it sticks to what they are good at.  If your entree comes with a salad, I would get their Italian wedding soup instead.  The salad is fine, but not extraordinary.  The soup, however, is fan-freakin-tastic!  Then if you're in the mood for something light, try the ravioli or a pizza.  If you really want to pig out, you really can't go wrong with anything.  The lasagna is like a million layers of yum.  The chicken parm is slap-your-grandma good.  The alfredo is rich and creamy and comforting.  The portions are large, so plan to take some home.  Don't worry, they wrap up food like real pros- they wrap the styrofoam containers securely in plastic wrap.  I haven't tried their desserts since I'm always stuffed to the gills, but I saw a tiramisu come out once that was the size of my head.    Okay, gotta go, I'm hungry now."}
{"text":"Had the Veal Aglio Olio. Really nice dish! Pasta was done al dente. The little garlic rolls were hot and tasty. I thought that the service really good. Just the right amount of attentiveness and very professional. Don't the strip mall feel of the location deter you trying this eatery!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago my wife and I made a rare visit to Crocker Park (we live on the far east side in Solon) to do some Christmas shopping.  We were going to have dinner at one of the restaurant's there but after returning to our car to store our packages just decided to head home and eat some place closer to home.  On our drive down Crocker to catch I-480 we happen to notice the sign for Daddona's in a small plaza on Crocker.  We knew Jimmy Daddona's (a Solon institution we have been going to for years) had a west side location but did not have a clue where it was.  Since we always enjoyed the food at Jimmy's we decided to pop in and check the place out.  We had planned to just sit at the bar but upon being greeted by the host was informed  that while they had a full liquor license (beer, wine, liquor), they did not have a actual bar.  He suggested a cozy booth near the front, as the booth's in the back of the restaurant were occupied, and it was actually perfect.  It was a bit busy for a Tuesday night (holiday season I guess) with some larger parties.  The host returned quickly with water and mentioned that Mike would be our server, but he was currently occupied with a larger table and that he would be starting us off.  We noticed a Meomi Pinot Noir on the wine list, one are favorites.  We had intended to only get a glass but it was only offered by the bottle so we decided go for it as we were told they could cork it for it if we did not finish.    While the host went off for our wine we, noticed and observed with a bit of amusement and appreciation the young man who we eventually would find out was our server Mike.   He was occupied with a table of eight about 10 feet from our booth and boy was he occupied.  It looked like the table from  hell; people spoke at him all at once, asking a million questions and asking the same ones over and over as he went around.  Despite this he appeared very pleasant and patient.  Moreover, on a couple of occasions during this theater we were enjoying, he notice us and smiled, mouthing that he would be right with us.  We were having such a good time watching it was no big deal, especially since our wine was brought out promptly by the host.  Mike eventually escaped the table, checked on a couple of his other tables (he seemed to have about 4-5 others) and approached us and apologized for the delay.  It actually had not been that long and in the mean time we had been well taken care of by the host.  Mike ended up being one of the best servers we had at a restaurant in a long time.  Despite the fact he was clearly busy he spent a fair amount of time with us discussing the menu and the two specials offered that evening.  The menu was slightly different from the Solon menu, but all our long time favorites were listed (chicken marsala, the best lasagna in town and the tomato cream pasta with chicken to name a few).  We noticed the west side restaurant had a strip steak listed, prepared a number of ways, which does not appear on the Solon menu.  We decided to take our time and ordered the mussels olio to start as we sipped our wine.  We order mussels all over town, but we always enjoy Daddona's in the olio sauce (which we soup up with their well know garlic rolls) the most.  We know what large portions you get, and we planned to order dessert, so we ended up splitting our entr√©e (3 dollar plate charge) and ordering an extra salad (one comes with the meal...in fact salads or wedding soup are included with all entrees).  Even though we had just polished off a bowl full of mussels, we could not resist ordering the fruit di mare, an old time favorite of ours, which includes mussels, shrimp and scallops served over linguine in a calm sauce.  It tasted just as good if not better than the Solon restaurant.  Even though the restaurant was busy everything came out timely and Mike checked on us a number of times to make sure everything was alright.  Like I said we ended our meal with the cheese cake (served with a raspberry sauce) we have been chowing down for years in Solon.  We just cannot resist as it simply the best, and as explained by the host who served it (and something we already knew), it is made by the owner's mother.  Things slowed down at this point and Mike was able to chat with us a bit.  We discussed the large table he seemed to be having so much fun with through out the evening (it only got better as the night went on) and we had a couple of good chuckles about the experience, although he was very polite about the table.  If Mike is working I would definitely ask for him if he is available.  Good food, good service...a great family owned reataurant."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Dadonna's a few times and gotten carry-out a few more.  We used to like it, but now I'm done with this place.  Tonight we paid for soggy calamari that was slightly red as it appeared a little sauce had been spilled on it - not sure if that was intentional.  Anyway, it was gross.  The salads were limp and obviously thrown carelessly into the containers - just a bunch of barely chopped iceberg lettuce, a slice of cucumber, some grated carrot and a generous handful of cheap mozzarella cheese.  The blue cheese dressing had a taste of blue cheese in it, but nothing vaguely resembling actual pieces of blue cheese - it looked and tasted like it came from a large can.  The meat sauce for the spaghetti had no meat in it.  The marinara sauce for the other order of spaghetti was bland - were any spices used in it?  The meatballs were overcooked, mushy and vile-tasting.  The chicken marsala was okay - that's the best I can say about it, not bad, nothing special, just okay.  With half a dozen other decent Italian restaurants in and around Westlake, there's no reason to waste your time and money on something like this.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight. Excellent service, great meal, and a comfortable atmosphere. We absolutely loved the piano player Sarah Marie Klingler, what a doll.  We will be back  soon."}
{"text":"I've come to their lunch quite a few times with my brother. It's typically very quiet and slow so the service is great for us. Food is really good, and portions are enormous! As others have mentioned the bread is absolutely killer. The location and decor are lacking in ambiance, but it's still a nice place. And the patio is nice too. If you like Italian it'd be dumb to pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience. We had a large party and they had half of us at one table, and the other half 20 feet away. When the drinks came, the waiter spilled a full beer down the back of one of our older members. The only thing they gave him as an apology was a free beer. Then another member of our party found someones ring in his garlic bread. The owner of the ring came out and said that she has been looking for it since the day before. She played the whole thing off as a joke. The only thing he got for this disgusting incident was a single cannoli for dessert. The menus were dirty and the ceiling had numerous wet spots and even a section with panels missing and insulation exposed.  The food was nothing special. The service was extremley slow. It took well over an hour to get our food. I also noticed the table of 2 next to mine also had to wait over an hour for their food. I, along with the other 14 members of our party, will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Lisa is the best hostess ever!Drove 6 hours to get there. Food, service, awesome. Would go back again just because of the wonderful hostess! Location is easy to find. Prices are a bargain."}
{"text":"Decent food..  decent service.   Surprise at the end!  You should know that this place doesn't accept American Express!  Are they the last restaurant in North America that doesn't accept American Express??!!  A sign at the door might have been appreciated."}
{"text":"Worst owner ever. Both me and my wife had a side dish with marinara sause, the sause had a bad smell ( as if it was burnt when preparing), we told the waiteress ( she was really nice). She smelled it, agreed with us and said she will bring us new ones. After a minute she comes back and appologies to us saying the owner yelled at her and said that he made the sause today and it was fine. He never came to the table to talk to us or at least try to explain to us why it smelled so so bad. We did not even finish our food, just paid the bill and left never to return to that place again."}
{"text":"Always is, was a great option. Portions and flavor a plenty. The meat sauce alone is amazing. How about the lasagna? Veal park? Chicken Marsala? You couldn't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We had 16 people in our party. We were there on a Sat night 7:45pm. They were not busy. Took us a while to get our drinks. Had to ask for the bread that they give you as a free appetizer. Took for ever to get our food, the food was not hot, half of it was eh ok. The rest was good. Do not get the Antipasta salad meat was of not good quality, did not like the cheese or dressing."}
{"text":"I enjoy Jimmy Daddonas in Solon, so decided to make the trip over to the west side.  They are definitely lacking a bar, so there was no wait on a Saturday night.  Ordered an appetizer and it was cold in the middle.  Asked the waiter and he said it was reheated.  In other words they used the microwave.  Bread is the best part of the Daddonas.  They are cutting corners at the Westlake location."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've had in years. Not only was the $12 boxed pasta as bland as the interior design but we also had the worst server I've ever seen. Jesse literally screamed at my grandfather after he mispronounced his name. Completely unprofessional. Avoid at all costs. Mcdonalds is a better option."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see the positive reviews, to be honest. I've been wanting to go here for so long because I love Italian food and it was extremely disappointing. The best part of the meal was the bread. I ordered veal and the meat was tough and chewy. The breading fell off completely and had no flavor. Won't be going. There's better Italian out there."}
{"text":"The food was Absolutely terrible. Way over priced and not even real Italian food. The waiter did not even come back to ask us how the food was because he knows it's disgusting. We left paying 80 plus dollars for two of us and no drinks."}
{"text":"Daddona's is my favorite!  I'm Italian so my family hardly goes out for Italian food. If we want some good spaghetti or lasagna, we make it ourselves. But when we are too tired to cook and want some good pasta, we head here. I never get anything other that the Fettuccine Alfredo. It is ah-maz-ing!  The sauce is made to order and melt in your mouth delicious! The perfect amount of garlic, cream and cheese. And the portions are huge! Even after I have stuffed my face to capacity with this deliciousness I still have enough left for lunch the next day. And the garlic rolls. OMG. Little pieces of bread Heaven covered in garlic and parmesan cheese.   Great. Now my stomach is growling and my mouth watering. And all I have at my desk is a lousy Fiber One bar. I need Daddona's STAT!   My only complaint is that the service isn't very friendly. They aren't rude, but they aren't exactly welcoming either. Sometimes it has even seemed like they are bothered to do their job. And this is true for both the Solon and Westlake locations. Oh well. A stick in the mud server is nothing that would keep me away from my Alfredo!"}
{"text":"Really good lasagna, really yummy house salad dressing. Delicious garlic rolls. RIDICULOUS portions of food. Like- send you home with a shopping bag ridiculous.  They have a patio outside which is nice. Only problem: next time do I get the yummy lasagna again or try something else?"}
{"text":"Excellent low key italian restaurant in Westlake right down the street from crocker park. We Had the lasagne, Sicilian pizza, chicken Marsala, and creamy tomato pasta. Everything was good and reasonably priced compared. Much better food quality than brio!"}
{"text":"Food: Fantastic Atmosphere: Clean, Generic Italian, needs work! Bathrooms: Clean Service: OK, needs a little work  We loved this place, my brother in law has been to the place in Solon for years and was very excited to take us to the new location in west lake.   The pizza was the best I've had in a while Sicilian Crust with Sausage. Chicken parm was good, pasta agliolio was excellent, bread rolls were great! Overall I'd definitely recommend this place, portions are huge so be careful how much you order."}
{"text":"I was really quite surprised at the lack of ambiance for an Italian restaurant so close to Crocker Park.  The interior reminded me of a chain restaurant which serves breakfast 24/7.  Most of the wood laminate tables do not have tablecloths.  A few of the large, round tables do though.  There are a few chairs in the back which have cloth seat back covers but the remainder of the chairs are just plain and uncomfortable.  The pages on my menu were very dirty.  This could have been easily remedied by putting in a fresh printed sheet.   The \"house Italian\" salad dressing looked and tasted like it came from a bottle (stayed emulsified the whole time it sat on the table).  When I asked for freshly grated Parmesan, I was told that they don't have any but that they \"put the Romano cheese into the shakers themselves\".  Not impressed with the garlic knots and felt the overall quality of the food was mediocre.  Happy Hour only during the summer when patio is open.  Would not return. Prices are reasonable so I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Good, hearty Italian food,  Two Italian friends (both 100%) like this place, so that tells me a lot.  Watch out for the garlic knots served as bread - they refill them and they are addicting!  Salads are cold and tasty, and a generous size.  I always get the pasta with arrabiatta sauce - not as spicy as I like but tons of flavor.  If you're with kids, take them early - there is no kids' menu but they are very accommodating about making noodles with oil and cheese, etc. and splitting the plates.  It seems to be a popular place for groups of friends to go, and I'm sure a lot of them have sitters with their kids at home so don't appreciate hanging out with anyone else's kids."}
{"text":"Visiting this area for the 1st time.  The food here is absolutely amazing.  Started off with the Wedge Salad and had the Lasagna for my meal.  The lasagna was extremely fresh and was probably the best I have ever had.  The service was very good and the staff was very accommodating to our large group.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I like the salad and garlic knots. The chicken parm and veal parm were good. The atmosphere is just okay. The prices are a little high for the food. We come here on and off but there are better Italian restaurants out there."}
{"text":"The service at Daddona's was fantastic, our waiter was very professional and quick.  The prices were a lot cheaper than what I had expected, especially for Westlake, but I really liked this Italian food.  I will for sure go back to try out their other options because their ravioli was really good! Perfect location too :)"}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation from a friend, and was very happy with what my experience.  We had a party of 6 and everyones food was great.  I liked their white pizza, and my husband raved about their Arrabiata sauce.  I must mention their garlic rolls, they are fantastic!"}
{"text":"We revisited this place last night after several months away, and it was pretty much the same as I remembered, which is to say good to great italian food.   Nothing out of the ordinary on the menu, which runs the usual gamut of italian staples (veal and eggplant parm, meatballs, sausage, seafood, marinara, alfredo, etc.), but I have yet to be unhappy with a menu choice over the course of 4-5 visits.  The calimari appetizer is a favorite, and the complimentary garlic knots are delicious and addictive.  I'm also a fan of the Carbonara.  Portions are large, and this is one of the few restaurants in Cleveland that will send me home with a doggy bag. No mean feat.  The service is decent, and the restaurant is clean, but one thing to note is that the dining room is very loud.  While the lighting is dim and a little romantic, don't expect your date to hear your sweet nothings if you whisper them across the table."}
{"text":"I came to Daddona's with my family so there were 9 of us seated together (although 2 were not eating-just sharing our bottles of wine).  We didn't have a reservation but there were only 3 other tables (2-5 people each) during our Sunday night dining experience.  I don't feel our large group should have been an issue but service was slow.  Refills were non-existent, even when we wanted to purchase an additional bottle of wine.  We ended up flagging the busboy and then quickly placed our food order because we weren't sure when the waitress would return.       It was my first time but my dad has been a big fan of this place for awhile so I didn't want to complain in front of him.  However, had the waitress stopped by once throughout our meal, I most certainly would have pointed out the flaws in my meal.  I ordered the seafood linguine (frutti de mare), which is my go-to dish at any Italian restaurant.  The sauce was a bit on the watery side and had more of a cream look than I expected with a marinara description.  However, the worst part came with my second bite and a sharp jab to the inside of my check.  Mussel shells were shattered throughout my dish.  The mussels that were intact didn't have any meat inside.  It was an interesting presentation.  I spent about 10 mins picking out shells before moving further in my meal.  Not once did the server come by asking how things were or if we needed anything.  Daddona's version of my normally favorite meal left a lot to be desired and was overall a huge disappointment.    My family had mixed reactions to their dishes--I know 2 siblings had an alfredo pasta and liked it, my husband had something he considered okay (it was a chicken dish but their website doesn't have the menu and I can't remember the actual name).  We all raved about the garlic knots-those earned a star on their own.  And having a salad included with an entree is also a plus.  So this place isn't all bad but I don't have any plans to return."}
{"text":"I THINK I ordered the chicken masala, which came with a small house salad and pasta.  Fine print on their menu: \"All entrees are served with a salad. All non pasta entrees include a side of pasta.\"  The salad was just some iceberg lettuce with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers.  Very simple.  The pasta was basically spaghetti with a dollop of tomato sauce.  Even though they came complimentary, I can't disregard them because both were so aesthetically displeasing and tasted bleh...to the point where they should just be omitted from service.  The chicken masala was average.  So average, I can't even remember if that's really what I had that night.  Yes, portions are big and I had to doggy bag my complimentary pasta, but the food was just okay.  So up until now, I would give this place 2 stars.    BUT, HOLD ON!  The garlic knots!  Those were some 5 star quality garlic knots!  A carb dieter's worst nightmare!  Some might think it's too buttered or too garlicky, but cast all your cares because they are delicious.  I have friends who go to Red Lobster's just for their biscuits and order entrees just because they have to.  Well, I would go to Daddona's JUST for the GARLIC KNOTS!  I may have eaten a whole basket of them if not more.  I had the left over garlic knots doggy bagged with my pasta.  To be honest, the pasta was just an excuse to get some garlic knots home.  People, get the point?  BEST GARLIC KNOTS ARE AT DADDONA'S!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. We had great service tonight and loved the food. My husband who is usually so critical of restaurants, loved it too! They have live piano music Friday's and Saturday nights.  The portions are big but they'll box what's left up for you. On top of that, they'll wrap them in plastic so no spills! Will recommend and definitely go again!!!!!!'A++++"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant, hands down! My boyfriend introduced me to Daddona's five years ago, and we've frequented ever since! The wedding soup is delicious, the garlic rolls are absolutely TO DIE for, and the dinners are amazing! My boyfriend's meal of choice is the Pasta Carbonara, he's never got anything else as long as I've known him! Haha. He definitely looks forward to it. I usually get the delicious Chicken Parmagiana, and this time I finally decided to try the Chicken Jobre I've always been eyeing. FABULOUS! This will be my new go-to meal. Thanks for keeping everything fresh, delicious, and of the highest quality! We always look forward to our Daddona's dates ;)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going there for a few years now.  Good food and service...until we went there 2 days ago and they were closed permanently with no warning.  A little sign was on the door saying to go to the Solon location.  This is too far to go so Goodbye, Dadonna's!  I'm sure you had your reasons."}
