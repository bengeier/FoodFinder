{"text":"Love this spot! Great food service is wonderful. It's definitely a local spot. I always order the cheesy beef sandwich with Chios and a sun drop. It makes my mouth happy! :) don't forget blue cheese crumbles! Out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  If you are a hot dog lover this is a must visit place if ever in the area.  I don't write many reviews but I love the small business guy.  You have to try the Carolina bubba.  omg can't say enough about this place.  Mike the owner is also a pleasure to visit with just a plus"}
{"text":"Awesome service from Mike & a great atmosphere! Had the Reuben, Mufalletta, & Cuban sandwiches and they were all fantastic! High quality ingredients at affordable prices. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My first experience here, and I have to say it was great. Very clean, lots of character and friendly staff. Mike was very helpful and I have to say my muffuletta was spectacular.  I can't wait to come back to try something else. Everything everyone else had looked delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  Great service, friendly people, cool decor and walkable from anywhere downtown.  Plus, the hot dogs are absolutely delicious!  I'm a particular fan of the Carolina Bubba.  The chili is made in house and is some of the best I've ever had.  This place is perfect for a lunch/snack stop when you're out shopping.  Try it out!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. Food is delicious and inexpensive. A good, local place ... Southern style. Recommended."}
{"text":"Miller & Kasper is a great little local place in downtown Gastonia with good food at a great price.  This is a perfect place to stop for a quick lunch. It is within walking distance of pretty much anything in downtown Gastonia, and is a good option for someone that works in the area, is at the courthouse down the road, or just someone driving through.   Miller & Kasper is predominantly a hot dog place, but they also have a small selection of sandwiches. Let me go ahead and get this out of the way, so that people have the right expectations: This place is very small with only about a dozen bar stools inside for seating and a few tables outside. There is also a limited selection for someone who does not like hot dogs.   With that being said, the hot dogs are 100% beef and are as tasty as advertised. They have about 10 options for their specialty dogs: ranging from a hot dog with Russian potato salad to a Traditional Carolina Dog with mustard, chili, slaw, and onions. For those of you who like to choose your own toppings or for those of you who just like a Plain Jane hot dog with no fixings, they've got you covered here as well.   I ordered the Traditional Carolina Dog, because I'm a sucker for anything \"Carolina\" Style. The chili on the dog was very good and was made in-house. Everything that is not made in house is supplied by local vendors, which is always awesome to see. The hot dog itself was quality beef and had a very nice texture to it. Even with all of the toppings, the flavor of the dog was able to shine through. This place also does glass bottles of soda. I got a glass bottle Cheerwine, which is one of the greatest things to have in your hands on a warm summer day.   They have some great seating outside with patio style tables and umbrellas. This is great place to get some fresh air over lunch and it is located on Main Street, which still has a vintage small town feel to it. The inside is small, but nice. Most people seem to do take out for lunch, so it really isn't a problem.   I would definitely recommend stopping in here for lunch one day and checking out what Historic Downtown Gastonia has to offer."}
{"text":"Small location, small menu, great hot dog! Not a lot of room to sit and eat but it is enough since most people got carryout. You can tell that not only are the dogs all beef, but great quality as well! The people are wonderful, friendly and give the right atmosphere. Constant flow of customers while I was there. This place really hit the spot and I will be back next time I visit Gastonia."}
{"text":"Love this place! Owner is a great guy who cares about adding value to the neighborhood and the food is fresh and local. I strongly recommend the Cuban!"}
{"text":"I heard about the hot dogs at this place and stopped in to get some with my daughters.  Much to my surprise they make their own Italian Beef and Giardiniera.  Being from Chicago - there is only one other place I know of to get Italian Beef in the greater Charlotte area (and no, the place in Uptown selling Vienna doesn't count - I want real Italian Beef).  My daughters and I both really enjoyed the Italian Beef especially getting them soaked in the beef juice.  I normally don't do Giardiniera on my beef, but they added it by mistake and what a mistake it was.  I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed the Giardiniera (warning if you aren't used to it, it would be too spicy for some).  Even though they replaced my sandwich for free, next time I will be ordering it with the Giardiniera.  The Italian Beef is all home made and they do a great job on it.  We will definitely be back and next time will try the hot dogs as well."}
{"text":"I came here today at their 11:00 a.m. opening time to try a Miller & Kasper hot dog, specifically the \"Bubba\" Carolina style frankfurter.   FOOD $5.75 - SOUTHERN BUBBA HOT DOG  - 4 stars. Their Carolina hot dog might as well be thought of as a foot long, because it is the size of two hot dogs. I didn't take any pictures because mine looked just like all of the others pictured on this page. The actual all beef wiener stuck out about an inch on both ends of the bun and curled upward. The frankfurter had a delicious taste and a great snap to the casing. The homemade chili was thick and savory. The yellow onions were potent. The coleslaw was good as well.   Quibbles? The bread had a tough section or two from being reheated, and I like a wiener with a lot of char, so that's why I gave this hotdog four stars. Don't get me wrong, this was one of the best hot dogs that I've ever eaten.   I ate almost the entire hotdog, holding it in my hand, because it was simply too substantial to put down. These are BIG hotdogs, and well worth their reasonable price.   (Note: Just so you know.......I didn't eat for a full 24 hours after having lunch at Miller & Kasper and consuming this gigantic hot dog.)  I would definitely order the \"Carolina Bubba\" again without any hesitation.  \"It's darn good!\"  $16.75 - MUFFULETTA (the whole sandwich) - 4.5 stars.  The photos on Yelp convinced me to purchase a Muffuletta.  This type of sandwich is premade and kept cold in the restaurant. Mike, the owner, told me to \"warm the slices in a frying pan, first on one side and then the other. The ingredients need to stay at room temperature.\" (I found that covering the sandwich, ala a grilled cheese sandwich prep., also allowed the cheese to melt slightly, which was wonderful.)  Having this sandwich premade or taking a day or two to eat a Muffuletta is no problem, because the olive spread only gets better with age as the ingredients and flavors meld together.   This sandwich has a multitude of Giardiniera veggies, olive spread, including capers, so I didn't need to add any extra from the fridge. The Foccacia bread is GREAT, there are a generous application of cold cuts, and the cheese is delish. I ate an entire half after following the owner's instructions. The bread, which had a drizzling of olive oil, crisped up nicely. The sandwich was delicious. I have not had a better Muffuletta outside New Orleans, and that's saying something.   Miller & Kasper has COCA-COLA, both in the small, six oz. bottles, and cans - both cost an even $1.00. Yes, I also am a native Carolinian, so I love that CHEERWINE is available. VIRGIL'S BLACK CHERRY CREAM SODA is also a favorite.   DECOR - 5 stars. EXTREMELY CLEAN! Inside of the tiny restaurant there are no tables, only stools for ten people to sit at counters along the walls ala Hap's Grill in Salisbury, NC. This is actually a GOOD thing because, like any great, well loaded hot dog, these dogs are messy. I ate leaning over the counter and this helped the fallouts to stay in the tray and not on my shirt.  There is a large screen TV, and Mike is running back and forth from the kitchen to the outside prep area to ready the food. A hot dog will take about ten minutes to be prepared, because Mike wants them to be as good as he can make them. Trust me, it is worth the wait.   OUTSIDE There are two or three umbrella covered tables outside in front of the restaurant that seats four persons per table. Downtown Gastonia is a charming place so sitting outside is a good option on nice days.   RANDOM THOUGHTS and SUGGESTIONS Mike said that he has been making a large, grilled, marinated, breast of chicken sandwich which sells out daily.  There is also a RUEBEN on the menu, and ITALIAN BEEF, as well as a CUBAN SANDWICH - several of my favorites. That means that I'll be making at least at least three trips back to Gastonia to visit Miller & Kasper.   Mike, the owner, is a charming and friendly individual. We pretty much kept up a running conversation, off and on, the entire time that I was waiting for my order. He was cutting up yellow onions that were so strong that my eyes were watering and I retreated towards the door to alleviate the aroma.   The young lady who was helping and taking orders was extremely nice as well. She had a great personality, and joked with me. Both she and Mike made me feel VERY welcome in their restaurant.   CONCLUSION All in all, this is a wonderful place to grab a sandwich. Great food. Friendly people. An easy to find location, with ample FREE parking. I'll be back for sure. I only wish that the restaurant was located in Hickory!"}
{"text":"Awesome delicious corned beef.  Loved the hot dog.  Makes his own sauerkraut.  Sooooo good.  Soup bowl to die for!!!  Owner is a hottie."}
{"text":"Fantastic hotdogs. Can't wait to try the fried bologna!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this time I reminded myself to take a picture first. And...I took my Mom (awww, how sweet!) - she is an ex-chef and loves good food like I do. Finally tried the Italian Beef = huge, juicy, covered with spicy pickled salad and oh, I forgot, \"out of this world good!\" At first I thought Mike, the owner, was going to wipe down the counter. Oh no, that handtowel was for me. It comes with the Italian Beef so you can continually wipe your chin, neck, elbows - you get the image. Wash it down with a Cool Mountain Black Cherry (Des Plaines, Ill.) and you will be one happy camper. My Mom got to try the Carolina Traditional which she really enjoyed (how proper!) and also got to sample his muffaletta olive salad and caponata (both amazing). We got to sit and talk with Mike while we ate. Not only is he really just plain nice, but knows a lot about food and cooking. This place rocks!!"}
{"text":"Great little place, with awesome soda from glass bottles! Friendly customer service, too. Definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"Just passing thru otw to Asheville to take care of family business.  Stopped here to eat on strength of Yelp reviews.  Glad I did.  Worth it.  18 y/o son said best hot dog ever; I'd call it a VERY close second behind the now defunct Hot Diggity Dog we used to have in D.C."}
{"text":"Another visit and another truly great sandwich.  I had the Rubin and it was delicious. I love rubins and have had good and very bad ones. This one beat them all, hands down! This was stacked high with meat and made with a great Marble Rye. Outstanding.service as always"}
{"text":"Best hot dog around and was worth the 30 min drive! Wish they had some nice sea salt and vinegar fries though"}
{"text":"A good find on a long journey back to miami thru Atlanta. The hot dog with chili was very good. The dog \"snapped\" with lots of flavor. I licked out with the chili. It had no beans. That's the only way I like it. Good chili.   The place is on a main st in an old town that needs revitalizing. But when it does it will be a \"go to\" local."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches and dogs in town. I am so impressed with this place and the friendly, and welcoming staff. Be careful though, the muffuletta is seriously addicting!"}
{"text":"Really good food in the family run restaurant in downtown Gastonia. The owner works here and is passionate about the food.  Mike gave us several samples of his personal favorites and took the time to explain why he has what he has on the menu."}
{"text":"Huh?  Really?   We were on our way to Gastonia around lunchtime, and wanted some sort of local cafe.   Saw K&M's stellar reviews so had to go.  Completely disappointing.   First, very limited selection of sandwiches.  Second, it took forever to get my sandwich (mine was their only order at the time), but figured, for the great sandwich I was about to get, it would be worth the wait).  Then I unwrapped my corned beef sandwich.  It was thin - maybe two pieces of corned beef.  And the corned beef could have been called corned fat & gristle.   Gross.  Ate half of it and couldn't go any further.    On the other hand, my wife's peanut butter & banana on cinnamon bread was excellent.     In all fairness, neither of us ordered a hot dog.  That's what they seem to be known for, and they might be outstanding."}
{"text":"Our first visit here, and we can't say enough! Love it! My wife had the Carolina Bubba dog, and I had the Turk. Both were awesome! Great prices and the service was friendly. This downtown area is on the comeback, and it's great to have an awesome hot dog place to grow with it! We'll be back!"}
