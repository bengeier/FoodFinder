{"text":"Good stuff. Nothing but positive experience. Business did not try to cintact me for my name and number so extra stars!"}
{"text":"why I like this place:

1. I'm in love with their green curry. I have no idea if it is authentic, I just know it takes me to a happy place.
2. the staff is always friendly and attentive
3. their lunch special is very reasonable and high on tasty points.
4. they deliver, bonus for an occasional hermit like myself.
5. sticky rice with mango. the slight saltiness of the rice with the creay sweetness of the coconut sauce and mango...*omnomnom*. again, I'm unsure of the authenticity, but it always takes me to a happy place."}
{"text":"I ordered soup. It was cold. It is not supposed to be a cold soup. It was not that good. My friends ordered other dishes and did not like how much oil was in the sauces. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"The worst. If I were you I would save my time, literally, and avoid taking the time to read this and call up the other Thai restaurant in Little Italy. I promise you will be happy you did.

I was very disappointed with my order. I ordered from Just-Eat for Sit In Bangkok and received my confirmation email at 7:58pm. I also received the delivery time update, first of 20:45 and then it was changed to 21:15. At 21:25 I called the restaurant and they sounded confused as to whether I had even ordered. They asked me to repeat my order and then said it would arrive in 10 minutes (9:35). I FINALLY received my order at 9:56pm- almost 2 hours later! I ordered a large order of Veg Tom Yum soup- it came with enough broth for one person and enough vermicelli for 10. I also ordered spring rolls and Bangkok Pad Thai. My food was cold, the quality was extremely poor and the portion size very small. The shrimp in the Pad Thai were not edible as they were so dry and the spring rolls were soggy. 

No one should never have had to wait 2 hours for a delivery. I could have telephoned another restaurant and had a delivery within the hour. Needless to say, I live 5 minutes from Sit in Bangkok and could have walked there faster. Hell, I could have walked all the way to Chinatown, sat down and ate, AND walked back. Not great.

My date and I were starving by the time the food arrived and when I asked the delivery driver why it took two hours he simply said \"ugh we're really busy\" and ran off. No apology. After a few bites we ended up throwing out most of the food anyways as it was cold and soggy. 

Next time I'm going to order via telephone from the Thai restaurant on the next block.

Just say no to Sit in Bangkok."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout/delivery from this place through just-eat.ca yesterday.

i ordered:
Bangkok Pad Thai
Basil fried rice with beef
Curry lamb
Basil duck

All the dishes were quite tasty. I had never had pad thai that's white in color and expected the usual orangey color. However, it turned out to be quite tasty and the best pad thai I ever had. Fried rice had plenty of beef and basil pieces and was super tasty and got the right amount of spicy kick to it. Also tasty were the curry lamb and basil duck. Curry lamb had a good balance of lamb and coconut curry flavor and not too overpower.

Expected delivery stated in just-eat was 45 min but got to my place in 35 min.

I am not sure exactly what authentic Thai food is but the Thai food at this place definitely tastes a lot better than other 'Thai' places in city. The place is owned by Thai and claimed cooked by Thai and I do taste the difference. I like their food and I will try to go in the restaurant for a personal visit someday."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for lunch with a friend. We ventured to eat here because we purchased a voucher from CaptainSave.com. Moving onwards, we ordered the following:
Shrimps Fresh Roll (3 rolls) 
Calamari
Lunch Special: Chicken Pad Thai with 1 Bangkok Roll &Mango Salad
Lunch Special: Green Curry Chicken w/ 1 Bangkok Roll & Hot&Sour Soup

The service was excellent and the overall restaurant was clean except for the washrooms which I would not recommend using. The food was fresh and the amount of time we waited for our food was very short. The presentation of the food was surprisingly pleasant to my eyes and the flavours were very good. The calamari at Sit in Bangkok is amazing, it isn't breaded too much nor is it fried to the point of where you would find it greasy. All foods we had were full of flavour but very balanced.

The plus to this place is the lunch special's are $6.99, I'm not sure when the lunch hours are but we were there at 2PM. I love the overall variety of the dishes available. We would come here again if we decide to venture down to College Street."}

{"text":"Thai in Little Italy?  Who knew?  Having had this resto recommended to me more than once (well, twice), I decided to try their lunch special for $6.99 which runs every day, INCLUDING weekends.  I got the green curry with steamed rice, mango salad, and a \"bangkok roll\".  It was tasty (to my non-expert palate) as well as filling.

I happened to get the order as a takeout - it was well packaged and ready on time.

The chalkboard sign outside proclaims that the restaurant is owned and operated by Thais.  I believe it."}
