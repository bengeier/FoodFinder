{"text":"La Revolucion is amazing! Well no, it isn't, but that's exactly how I wanted to start this off. Man, I really wanted to love this place. La Revolucion just looks so dam cool, that I figured the whole experience was going to be amazing. When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.  La Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.  They're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.  Presentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.  Interestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is. La Revolucion may be a restaurant, but a revolution it is not."}
{"text":"Good stuff here! The sangria is great and the food is authentic. I think the food temp could be a little hotter and the service a bit more friendly/attentive. I highly recommend this place if you are taking a nice day in the Junction! Guacamole is the best!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place so badly! It's close to my home, rarely crowded and inexpensive, but the flavours just aren't there for me. Last night I had chicken enchiladas with rice and my boyfriend had steak and shrimp with rice. The chicken was fatty and didn't seem fresh, and the steak was the same. It feels like fast food meat vs. an actual grilled chicken breast or steak. Also, the restaurant was recently renovated but it still seems to lack a desirable atmosphere. Dimmer lights, real candles and new menus would help."}
{"text":"Margarita's that are too die for!  I've never eaten so much Mexican food in one sitting. Went with friends and we just kept ordering food. Everything was absolutely delicious. We started with nachos and were so tempted to order another serving. The tinga  tacos were my favorite and the fajitas were on point. The mood was great on a friday night with a local band Les Petits Nouveaux serenading us. The owner even got up to perform a song and blew us away.  We'll definitely be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Live in the area and dropped in for dinner,  I was disappointed.  There were 3 of us.  I had the steak tacos which were ok...the plate could have had some kind of garnishes, as advertised, some tomatoes, onions and even a leaf or 2 more of  cilantro,  the shrimp tacos were over spiced...way too hot. The shrimp ceviche was cooked in a horrible lime sauce and just barely edible. For an appetizer we order the guacamole with corn chips and when the girl served the corn chips they slid off the plate.  She proceeded to pick up the corn chips off the table and put them back on the plate. Hard to believe.  The guacamole needed salt or something it was very bland. We also ordered the sangria which were good. Overall, they need more attention to their service, but they certainly need to focus on food quality. We waited 40 minutes and the tacos were cold when served and lacked appeal. I would not go back or recommend this place"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a few nights ago. The junction was in serious need of a mexican restaurant.  It was 7pm on a nice Thursday evening. We were the only people in the place. In the hour and a half that we spent there, not a single person walked in.   The food is decent. Pretty good Guacamole. My Pork Burrito was tasty. A little bland. Very standard, average Mexican food. The Margarita was enjoyable and the Sangria was a little weak but tasty as well. The prices are very good.  If you live close by and have a craving for Cheap Mexican food and drinks, La Revolucion won't disappoint. But I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to visit this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love the $2 tacos on Wednesday and Thursday night during the comedy shows. Which are pretty funny! The burritos are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend one night when we had a hankering for tacos.  The food was pretty decent and authentic: guac and chips to start and the shrimp ceviche.  There were a lot of shrimp in the ceviche (that is, more than I would have expected given the price).  The tacos come in 3's and we were pleased when the waitress said we could mix them up, which was good because we couldn't decide on just one kind.  I ordered a pork, chicken and beef.  My friend had 2 pork and a chicken.  The pork was nice and flavourful, definitely the winner.  Both of us agreed that the chicken tasted a bit like \"funky feet\" ...I think it was the cheese on top.  Flavours were a little bit lacking and we had to ask for extra limes but the sangria was very delish.  The service was fine but slow and as the night went on the smoke coming from the kitchen rather filled the air to the extent that when I got home I smelled like Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Im obsessed with this place! Best dishes to try include:   Pozole- which is really filling! Great for when is freezing outside....   Tacos dorados- they are the best ones I have tried in the city!   Enchiladas during the morning on weekends are the best as well, delicious! And if you really want to try real huevos rancheros try them here!!!!! There are some other places in the neighbourhood to claim to offer them and trust me none of the are authentic as they are here. Always a great experience, keep the good work! Prices are so good also considering the freshness and quality of food, one of the best places to eat without breaking your pocket."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and the food is excellent and feels very genuine Mexican, not the pub-style Mexican or even hipster bar Mexican that is prevalent in our city.  Very good value for eat-in food.   The ambience is cool, not the very best in the city but good enough. When we were there, there was a small band playing and that was a nice touch as well.  Excellent service.   I'd give this place a 4.5 star if I could. Perhaps the decor (which is decent but not great) is impacting this. I don't give it a 5-stars because that says perfect and I don't know if there's a perfect restaurant in the city but this is superior Mexican food at very good prices. Visit and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like it but not tasty and not good value. Third star for the music in the back and the friendly people."}
{"text":"This place wins on friendliness alone. Nice change from the indifferent reception at some other Junction restaurants! But the food is great too--simple, authentic Mexican. The margaritas are just right, and there's often good live music. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food, music and comedy. Particularly Saturday and Sunday nights for the music,"}
{"text":"I love real Mexican food and I'm moving in 2 minute walk away, so went in with an open mind. Ordered the 4 tacos and got a different meat in each one. These are a lot smaller and one less taco than that Kensington joint for same price. Flavour was decent but still lacking from other Mexican places. The al pastor meat was dried out. I do set the bar a little higher though after trying the same Mexican dishes in LA. I wouldn't care so much except I left hungry after my tacos and guacamole. Portions are tiny! The coffee I really enjoyed though. From reading other reviews, it sounds like they may be inconsistent, so I'll give them another chance when I have $25+ to burn on a meal (which won't be anytime soon)."}
{"text":"La Revolucion is the Mexican neighbour you want to have, largely on account of their delicious cooking. Full disclosure: I handle the restaurant's new IG @La.Rev.Toronto which I do on a trade basis, and I'll be exploring their menu through that platform, but I would never have agreed to that had I not already been a fan of their cuisine. Outside of that, I'm a customer like everyone else. Toonie taco Tuesdays have been a weekly tradition of mine for going on a year now and I'm a big fan of the local Conductor's ale they have on tap. I recommend dropping by on a live jazz night; super nice vibe. I've always been a fan of the signage too, which is inspired by the streets of Mexico."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays for a Toonie!  I'm basing my review based on tuesday tacos.   In a nutshell, I'd only come back on Tuesdays because their tacos are so small that it's only worth your money if it's only $2. The tacos were tasty and mouth watering! I remember there were quite a few options. I ended up getting chicken tinga, steak and churizo. My favourite was the chicken, least favourite was the steak."}
{"text":"You need to throw away your preconceived notions about Mexican restaurants before you enter La Revolucion. You will not get free nachos and salsa and your plate will not be over-sized and covered in re-fried bean and rice. What you will get is delicious satisfying food. One Reviewer seemed to complain about not being fussed over by the waiter. This is not the place to take a first date however any day of the week when you don't want to cook you and your longtime companion can just saunter over to la revolucion have a really affordable meal of exactly what you ordered. The food is great the atmosphere is chill, the beer is cold, good and affordable. Just a great little home away from home."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried La Revolucion out a few weeks ago.   Meh.  The food was not great, it was just OK.    The girl serving us, (who apparently is the the owner but I could be wrong,) was very nice and helpful.  She did however seem far more interested in chatting with her friends at the bar about who-said-what and people in the neighbourhood who thought she'd \"never make it\".  Which doesn't bother me too much, but made me feel like a bit of a nuisance and that we were kind of interrupting her conversation by order food.  There's a lot better places in the Junction to spend your money!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the price. Playa Cabana down the street is trendier and tastier - but that means expensive and busy.  I recently came here with a friend for lunch and we had the place to ourselves. We both had enchiladas with green sauce (choice between red or green). Three small corn tortillas are filled with meat and topped with warm sauce and crema. The side of rice is standard and soaks up the excess, mild, green sauce. We tried a bit of red sauce on the side, and it was fiery! A whole dish of red sauce would be overwhelming. The beef was surprisingly tender, however there could have been much more of it. The dish was actually not very filling.  The service and atmosphere are nothing to write about.  Kings Taco on St. Clair is far better and for the same price!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican you can get in town for the price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant that I have been to. The food is tasty and authentic. The guacamole is fresh and tasty. The chips are not salty and oily and have that deep corn taste which I love. The guacamole is my favorite appetizer. The horchata is to die for. I could not believe how good it was. I ended up having seconds. I loved it so much. Now I really have to go back and have it again. What made me love this place too, is the fact that they have vegetarian options. I had the veggie El Burro. It was so delicious. The best I ever had. My second favorite main course was the veggie quesadillas. They were big and filling and also very tasty. I also had the veggie enchiladas and tacos. Both were very good.I loved the green salsa that comes with it. I also had the flan as well. Had a rich taste but was not bad at all. I would say overall the meal portions are decent, especially the guacamole appetizer. This is what real Mexican food is. So if you are in the Junction area, please visit this place. The food came quick and the servers here are very friendly and helpful. Overall if I could give this place higher than 5 stars I would. It is truly the best. I will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"As a Mexican living in Toronto, I have to say this is as authentic and great as you can find in this city. This has become my go-to Mexican restaurant after the first bite!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple times, the first time was excellent the second not so much. If you plan on eating here on a busy night prepare for painfully slow service! Also the last time I had the wrong meal brought out to me a couple different times! Thankfully once you are served, the food is tasty and the homemade salsas are very nice. I will eat here again, but only on slow nights!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite Mexican restaurant in the city. Very affordable, and so very very good. I'm pretty sure I've tried nearly everything on the menu and have not been let down yet."}
{"text":"Came here as part of the TD Jazz Festival last night. They had a nice set up with the bad playing in the front, and you can munch and drink while listening to them.   Only got a drink and some dessert, but seems like they serve Mexican food and might be a good alternative to Playa Cabana Cantina across the street. The question is, is the food good and authentic? Maybe. Menu has tacos and burritos among other things.   But the Sangria was really good. A little pricey at $6, but a good sized portion and glass size. It wasnt super sweet where it tastes like juice, and had real fruit. Seems like they make it , not from syrup. We also got fresh churros for $2 each Super crispy, but a little thick on the dough - it was still good with condensed milk drizzled on top.   I wasn't super impressed, but I definitely might give it a try again if craving mexican food."}
{"text":"Wonderful menu, been here many times.  Love the horchata. Very friendly service and the price is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Went back here a couple of weeks ago for dinner with friends, and it held up to my original review. Yay! I'm still a fan :)  We ordered the guac, it's very good. Always need more chips though. It's quite a good portion for an appetizer.   Also ordered a chicken appetizer... it was pulled chicken on a plate. Very good... mixed it all together with the guac and the chips.. excellent mish mash do it yourself appie lol  I ordered the fish tacos again, they were as awesome as the first time.  Friends ordered the beef and chicken tacos and the burrito. ALL AWESOME.   For the drinks, we had sangria and beers and they were great as well.  For all four of us, drinks and tip it was 200, and we drank and ate alot.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"This review is not based on their food because I did not get the chance to try it. I walked in to this restaurant and found it absolutely filthy. The menu was dirty and the table was revolting. I walked out and had dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"We've been there several times and have been happy with the service, low key and attentive. The atmosphere is comfortable and there were a variety of patrons. The guac was great, and the Junction burrito is amazing and filling. We have it most times, except on Tuesdays when they have amazing and cute cheap tacos. They're the little ones you actually get in Mexico, not the gargantuan fatty fakes you get at TexMex places. Often something interesting going on in the back too-tonight there were singers. Only caveat is that I would like more spice. If you want it a bit spicier, tell your server and they'll do it."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal :( Guacamole was decent and Mojitoes were great but we shared the fajitas and it was bland bland bland!! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Food was decent but server was rude and did not bother serving us drinks after we finished ours. Will not return."}
{"text":"The food at La Revolucion is authentic and quite good, especially considering how affordable the prices are. The service is sleepy but charming, and the functional decor is enhanced by Mexican pop music. Our only significant complaints are the lukewarm tapwater and the fact that the room is much too BRIGHT. Some dimmer lighting and real candles (not the fake ones they're using) would make this spot truly charming and enjoyable, rather than merely tolerable. We certainly would have stayed and had an after-dinner drink if not for the bright overhead lighting. Still, proper Mexican at fair prices."}
{"text":"The nachos were amazing, and even though the service isn't the fastest, it was worth the wait.  Cool place for live music."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. So over-priced for for self-proclaimed Mexican Street Food.  I've been eating here for a few years, historically I have really enjoyed the Junction Burrito($10), either chicken or chicken tinga. Also I've enjoyed their Nachos with Chorizo($14). I hadn't been in quite a while until July, and I've been twice this summer-- I was not as impressed as I had been previously. The first time I had my regular Chicken Burrito and it just wasn't as delicious as usual. The second time I shared Nachos with Chorizo, which were SO salty, and the Tacos Dorado($9.50) and was not only absolutely disappointed, but both me and and the person I dined with felt ill for over 24 hours. This wasn't an issue of food poisoning, it was a matter of the food being so over fried and heavy. The Tacos Dorados, which I know better as Flautas, were so bland and disappointing, having been deep fried within an inch of their lives they were completely flavourless. I have had really good Flautas in the past, and this was just so far from what I would consider palatable, not to mention the bizarre addition of feta as a sparse garnish. It didn't appear to be the same chef as before, and to be honest overall it didn't seem as clean. The service was not pro -- the waitress sprayed cleaner on the table when we were already sitting and the table was still sticky after she *kind of* wiped it off. The service was slow and just not super attentive.  At this point I have to address the music situation -- it's just awful. I recognize the merits open mic performances, both for people enjoying a sense of community as well as the potential for it to bring in customers for drinks and appetizers, but for me the quality of the music that I've experienced here has been bad enough - both open mic events and jazz nights - for me to avoid eating here any time there is music scheduled. But music aside, my recent experience was bad enough that I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"I've only had the soft tacos here but I've had them about 4 times and every time they were delicious and to my admittedly non-expert-level tastes, very authentic. The interior is nothing to speak of, and the server (owner?) I've had every time is very nice but does get over-busy often as she has to work the entire place herself.  June 2013 Update:  Now that I've been about 15 times and had more tacos (still excellent) but other things too I thought I'd say a little more.  The burrito is also very good.  Go on Tuesdays for cheaper tacos, and Wednesdays for cheaper burritos.  There are a few very good beers on tap including my favourite, Flying Monkeys IPA.  The first server I had is gone and the woman who works almost every time I'm there is uniformly excellent.    A very nice, unpretentious antidote to the much-hyped come-lately, Playa Cabana, 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos at a fraction of the price you pay down the street and delicious margaritas. Try chorizo and pulled pork tacos with a lime margarita to wash it all down. Skip the chicken options if you want lots of flavour."}
{"text":"Editing my review after this restaurant switched to new management. Not bad, will come back"}
{"text":"As stated in the previous reviews, great atmosphere,  friendly service, and reasonable prices. We got there at 6 on a Saturday and it was fairly quiet. When we left at 8, the restaurant was packed. Live music on Saturdays too! I will be back for more shrimp and white fish ceviche."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came here a 3 time sin the last few months.    Atmosphere (3.5 stars): On Tuesdays, they have live Jazz.  It is one of the main reasons why we my girlfriend likes the place.  Apart from that nice touch, the rest of the place is kind of worn down.  The washroom walls are covered in stickers, (seems like it is done on purpose but could just hide the rest of stuff).  The tables are used, the chairs seem to have new upholstery, but does not seem to be sticked very well.    Service: (1.5 stars) Most of the time the service is below average, today it was atrocious.  There are only 2 people working the whole restaurant, and it took us 1 hour to get 9 tacos.  The other tables around us were fairing about the same.  For the management, you NEED to get more people, the people employed are doing a good a job, but they need help.    Food: (3.5 stars) With the special on Tuesday, for $30 two people can be full. (without drinks). This would be $40 if it was on another day. The tacos are pretty delicious, but today they seemed a bit on the dryer side.  The pineapple in one of the tacos was so unripe it was white.   This place is worth it on a Tuesday, otherwise I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tuesdays is $2 tacos. And overall they are quite satisfying for what ur paying. I recommend the Churizo, The Steak, and the Chipotle Chicken."}
{"text":"We walked past this place several times before we realized it was a mexican restaurant (the exterior looks more like a bar and it's hard to tell if it's open from the street). Thanks to my trusty yelp app, though I figured out it was a restaurant we should try. We tried the tacos and a burrito. The tacos are tasty and well priced even without it being taco tuesday. The burrito was the best burrito we've had since leaving California. We also ordered a margarita. The drink was delicious and strong... just what you'd expect in a mexican restaurant!  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's a pretty solid option if you're in the neighborhood and hungry."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a work outing during the week. While my colleagues loved their Tinga Chipotle Chicken with Feta tacos there, I found my Fish Tacos to be a bit average and not that flavourful. Depending on the filling, they were $10-13 for 3 tacos. We also shared a side of the Muchos Nachos (which were pretty good) and a pitcher of the Fresh Lime Margarita (quite strong). While I would give the tacos 3 stars, the overall rating would be  a 3.5 just because the service was quite quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Well, we decided on a whim that we wanted Mexican food and we called around to some places that were highly rated and no seats were available. One of my favs, Chimichanga's, has disappeared, so we got to a point where we were just calling around to see WHO could take us. Finally...La Revolucion answered!  We walked in and were greeted with....a dishwasher, sitting in the middle of the floor. Sort of strange...maybe some kitchen renos? We walked to meet our friends and their table and were informed that the reservations were not made, or were forgotten and the waitress had had to kick out a single guy from the table and he was eating at the bar. Maybe he was lucky, because the table was SO sticky underneath that my shoes were sticking to the ground. I mean STICKING!  She took our drink orders and then gave us our drinks and walked away. It took us another 15 minutes before we could place our order. Around the table we ordered two burritos, one plate of tacos and one quesadilla and guacamole bites (which is basically nachos and guac).   The guac came out fast, and was quite good, but we then waited for almost forty minutes for our food!  Burritos were a bit bland. Needs some sauce in, or on top. Quesadillas were the same...nothing special. The tacos got favorable reviews, but again, nothing to write home about.   The back area houses a sort of club-like atmosphere, which is described in blogto as: \"...dark textured walls and ambient lighting, it is the opposite of its cocina counterpart. Records adorn the walls and instruments lay strewn about, giving it a relaxed basement rec-room vibe...July will see live music on Thursdays and Fridays with open jam Tuesdays. Flamenco Saturdays are in the works...\"  When we were there (on a Saturday) there was a sign out front for a \"dance party\". The lights were down in the back, with a sort of laser light show and early 90s hip hop music was playing. There were about three, older guys there, just hanging out, drinking. It seemed totally out of place. The music didn't match, certainly wasn't flamenco and that's a weird rec room vibe...if that's even something you would want in a restaurant.  I think this place has potential. People in the area like it and it has a nice vibe to it...or would, had we had better service and less stickiness and washers sitting around. I feel like the space is just not being utilized and that's a shame.   I WOULD have giving this place two stars, but the extra star was a result of the sangria, which is their \"secret recipe\" and were amazing. I had two actually.  Anyway, if I was in the area, I might stop in again, as everything was fine, but I don't think I'll be making any special trips to go there in the future. Don't think I'll be going for any dance parties!"}
{"text":"Great Salsa, beers, and chips!  Chicken Mole and Tacos were better than average.  The atmosphere fun, funky, and is nice for a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Consistently good Mexican food, fair prices and friendly staff. A go to spot for sure."}
{"text":"We had dinner at La Revlucion in the fall so my review is a bit delayed.  I always get excited when a new restaurant opens in the neighbourhood so we were looking forward to our meal.  We ordered an appetizer, shrimp tacos and a burrito, along with 2 Mexican pops. Most entrees were priced between $10-$12.  Service was very slow with only 1 waitress working and the space was almost full.  It took almost 40 min. before we got our food.  It was tasty and we really liked the salsa verde that accompanied it.   I would love to see this restaurant succeed but we haven't been back since our first visit.  I guess I'm looking for motivation to return."}
{"text":"Sigh, I so badly wanted to like La Revolucion.  The people are friendly, the decor is spartan (in a non-ironic way), but the food - well - it was disappointing.   I will first say that the guacamole is truly out of this world.  TONS of avocado, creamy, and overall delicious.  Their nachos are great.  But really ruined it for me was their ceviche.  First, it was warm.  WARM!  After taking the first bite, I thought I was probably in for an evening of food poisoning.  The fish and shrimp tasted like it had been boiled in lime juice.  The shrimp also tasted like an algae covered fish tank.  Not so appealing.    My fiance's tacos were okay, slightly bland, he said.    All that to say, if you are coming for drinks and nachos, and live music (which was fun) definitely come here.  But for anything else, not so sure."}
{"text":"It's a rainy night in Toronto, and this was the closest place to the intersection.  The food was a good quality, and the service was pretty good. It's no taco place in Kensington.. but it'll do for the Junction.  I had their special of the night, Pastor Taco's and to start Guacamole.  Both were decent. Not spectacular, and frankly, I'm still a bit hungry, but overall, decent.  Food: Decent, for the junction Service: Fair Recommendation: Do Up."}
{"text":"We are lucky enough to have our business in the Junction,  so of coursewe had to try EVERY eaterie in the area..having said that,as a chef trained iin mexican cuisine by a famed mexican chef in San Antonio, i can honestly say this is the BEST,closest to authentic mexican eaterie anywhere in TO..if you care about the food,this is the place to come..if it's atmosohere you want. head down the  street to Playa Cantina (food nowhere as good   and way more $$$)   No need to go into details, the pics say it all...absolute perfection"}
