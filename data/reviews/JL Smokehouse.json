{"text":"awesome bbq, I had the pulled pork and chicken and it was as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Just ordered and ate JL BBQ and it was amazing! Definitely recommend this place! James has great customer service and goes above and beyond. We will be eating here more often."}
{"text":"I've tried several different BBQ restaurants around the valley, none have really 'hit' the spot, until now. JL's BBQ is incredible. Even the beans are great, and that's high praise coming from a hispanic that thinks most BBQ places butcher their beans."}
{"text":"Forget it! The food was outstanding. I had the pulled pork and brisket. The sauce used had a nice vinegar and spice to complement the smoke. I had the Mac and Cheese on the side which was also fantastic. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Our first visit there and we are ready to go back tomorrow! The brisket was amazing and James even let us try a bit before we ordered to make sure it was what we wanted. We also ordered the half rack of ribs that were so flavorful. Portions were plenty and we got it to go still nice and hot when we got home"}
{"text":"Delicious. I have been driving past this restaurant for a while and finally stopped. I got brisket, pulled pork and mac n cheese. The brisket and pulled pork were smoky and spicy, tender and juicy. The mac n cheese was great as well. I took the food to go. I don't recall anything being offered to drink and there is only a few tables inside to sit. I will be back."}
{"text":"The ribs and pork are great! And I am not a big fan of pork so that says a lot. First time here and I will definitely be coming back. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the owner he was very nice and happy to help me with the menu. Prices are very fair as well. The peach cobbler is delicious, it reminds me of a cinnamon roll almost but still so good. I love seeing locally owned businesses like this in my area."}
{"text":"We decided to use JL's Smokehouse for our wedding reception dinner after reading reviews here. And we are glad we did!  The owner is extremely caring and attentive. Our food was correct and it was ready at the time we needed it on the wedding day. He is a down to earth person who truly enjoys going what he does.  We got the ribs and the pulled pork. The ribs were cooked to perfection! Numerous people at the reception commented on how much they loved the food and asked us where we got them from. The portions were generous and BBQ sauce and cute little hot sauce bottles were included. Thank you for helping make our wedding day the best day ever!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and never knew this place was here.  We have been on a journey as a family to eat all the BBQ places Arizona has to offer.  I happen to find this place by mistake.  I was looking for a place for the family to try today.  I typed in BBQ and JL Smokehouse popped up.  I never heard of it at all.  I looked at the reviews and website.  The reviews were positive, but reviews have little sway on me when it comes to a place. I like to try it for myself!   I met my family here today at 11 am.  We looked at the menus and ordered.  We all got different things with out sauce on the meat.  We wanted to experience the flavours of the meats.  I got the pulled pork sandwhich and it was good.  The BBQ sauce is thin.  Probably the way the family that runs it is used to making it where they are from.  It was great sauce!  I tried a 1/4 pound of the smoked sausage.  It was some of the best I have ever had.  It like melted in my mouth.  I tried a piece of the brisket my father had.  Holy shit that was some good stuff.  I have had smoked brisket but this one is different.  There is something that just sets it apart. The beans were pretty good too.  I was to stuffed for sweets after the meal.  I think this place is really good and worth a visit.  The place is cozy so get there early.    Just remember there are numerous BBQ places here now.  They are all different and really good.  There are places that do Memphis style, Texas style, Kansas Style and other styles here in AZ now.  Stop by and give this place a try.  I have a feeling you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped by JL Smokehouse today and met the owner JL, we hit it off right away since we were both from Arkansas, he gave me a tour of the smokehouse and I loved it, the BBQ ribs,Smoked Sausage,Chicken,Brisket, and Pulled Pork were all excellent, I HIGHLY recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Made my first visit last week. Very friendly folks. Brisket was fabulous. Only 3 tables so best to carry out. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome, no really. We got \"the hitter\", with choice of 5 meats and 3 sides. My favorite side were the beans and I'm not a bean person unless the beans are good. Worth the detour to try it out."}
{"text":"I love the saying \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\". That is what JL Smokehouse means to me. The outside looks unassuming and the inside has patron's writings on the wall. This place is meant for take out food but we dined in. We ordered  a pound of brisket, a 1/2 slab of baby back ribs, a loaded veggie bake potatoe, a large order of bake beans and cold slaw for 3 of us. I have never had Memphis style barbecue. It has a peppery, vinegar taste with minimal sweetness. If your looking for the meat to be lathered in sweet barbecue sauce you will be disappointed.  We didn't use a knife or a fork for the brisket. Just pick the meat up and start eating the most tender meat with the fat that liquidizes in your mouth like a soft candy.  The same thing for the baby back ribs. Fall off the bone meat with one bite better that the next. My favorite side were the greens. Very tender and flavorful. Most greens are cooked with some kind of pork . These greens had pieces of turkey in it.  The bake beans were not your usual over sweet style bean. these beans were Chile style. For me I used the beans with my brisket to give the meat some moisture.  The cold slaw wasn't your usual mayonnaise base slaw. It was firm and had a nice tang to it. Can you tell by my review I didn't like what we ate. The owner, his son and owners brother were great people to talk with. Friendly and informative. We are big fans of JL Smokehouse.  You will be too. Give them a taste."}
{"text":"Great place to get a fabulous meal! We were staying at the Legacy Golf Resort and wanted to get out and try some good local barbecue. We were pleasantly surprised how awesome this place was! We ordered the Heavy Hitter which is 5 meats and 3 sides. Everything was perfectly cooked. The sauce complimenting everything was perfect. We are definitely going back the next time we come down to Phoenix. Would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The Good: A family owned and operated single location Great food with huge portion size at a great price Awesome customer service  The Bad: Not the cleanest dining area  The Skinny: 5 stars. James is a BBQ artist extraordinaire. My taste buds were happy, this is some of the best BBQ I've had in a while, and I've been to BBQ places all over the South, Chicago, St. Louis, Georgia, the Carolinas, etc.   Although hard to spot from the street, thanks to Yelp and GPS, I found a barbecue heaven.  I tried going to Little Miss Piggy's a few miles away but with no parking and long line outside the door, I came here instead.   One of the coolest things for a foodie is to step into a hole in the wall and pull out a great prize.  Here, there is great food, good portion size, and a good value.  Barbecue places that are decent usually cost over $20 for a good sized platter.  But not here.  For $13, I got the choice of two meats and a fantastic mac and cheese for $13.00.  It was enough to feed two people. I came in smelling like after shave and came out smelling like wood smoke.  Heaven. Just so you know, the dining area has seen better days.  The walls had customer scribbled words of positivism and love.  I had just finished my last appointment of the day, so I came in at 2:00 PM.  There were still a few people coming in that were regulars. The owner said some of the selections might not be available, but I was able to snag the last of the Tri-Tip and Pulled Pork.  I waited for them to pack it, and then I saw they also had a home made peach mini cobbler.  Yes, sir, gotta have it!   Driving out of the parking lot was a challenge for a few minutes in this busy street. I took everything back to my hotel room and had a messy feast.  Both meats had great flavor, and were juicy and so tender from slow cooking in smoke.  The mac and cheese had a spicy tang.  The peach cobbler was a great finish with cinnamon peach in a cake like crust.  As hungry as I was, I could only finish half of what they gave me.  I certainly hope if I'm in the area again, I can try more of their selections."}
{"text":"I am happy I found this place. It is a gem. Real southern BBQ. You need to try this for yourself. Very friendly staff. Very good food."}
{"text":"This place is on its way to Little Miss status. Almost reminded me of the bbq place in house of cards. In other words a hidden gem. I ordered the half rack with a half a pound of brisket and mac & cheese. It was awesome. If you don't want to wait two hours in line at Little Miss this is a great alternative. Will be back soon. Thanks fellas!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!! JL (James) is not a pit master - he's an artist. Showed up and he was looking cling up for the night. Unlocked the door and let us in to enjoy what he had left from the evening. I had the half rack of ribs and smoked sausage. An experience. Don't miss it!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor... get off Yelp and go to this place right now! This is the type of barbecue that makes vegetarians carnivores!"}
{"text":"JL get's 5 stars for Customer Service + Powerful Flavor of everything! I am visiting Phoenix & wanted some good food via delivery. After glancing at JL's pictures and customer reviews, I ordered via Grubhub courtesy of YELP :) Then I called the restaurant to ensure my order was received. A gentleman answered the phone and was very pleasant. The conversation was so warm and inviting. We actually spoke on 3 occasions to ensure my order was perfect! He even called to let me know the GrubHub driver was on the way! The BEST DELIVERY experience I have ever had.  Food: I ordered the Heavy Hitter (5 meats , 3 sides) and when I received my order I actually had a SURPRISE! 6 Meats, 4 sides? WHOW O WOW! Brisket (tender and smoked to perfection) ,A double order of Rib Tips (delectable) ,Smoked sausage (mouth watering n juicy), Pulled Pork (he converted me into a pulled pork lover!-flavorful), and the BBQ Bologna was soooo delish, BEST I've ever had bc the meat was thick cut, fried crisp* each bite brought thoughts of \"why is this food so good?\" along with a few childhood memories, growing up in Memphis and all.   The BAKED BEANS were so yummy. Not that dried, bland baked bean fodder. JL's tangy, bold baked beans came with a kick! Wowzers! and I didn't even order them at 1st. So glad JL added them as a courtesy to my order.  Even his since of urgency is unmatched. I wanted the Peach Cobbler, it was sold out, and I was notified immediately that it would be refunded to my card with out question.   I recommend JL's to friends and fellow YELPERS!  CHEERS!"}
{"text":"I tried the ribs, chopped pork, brisket, beans, and greens. They were all very good. The ribs were perfect. Great bbq place with friendly staff"}
{"text":"So, there I was, driving along the original Funky, Funky Broadway early in afternoon on a very hot day circa the first week of June - after a good lunch. At a small strip of shops I saw the sign \"JL Smokehouse\" and, as I typically do, drove around the block just to see what this humble-looking joint was all about. (Duh, I know... BBQ!) I threw the truck in neutral, set the parking brake, & went inside. The enticing aroma of burning, mixed hardwood was a big clue! Inside this small restaurant, three comm workers were feasting on BBQ. They were regulars and just raved about the food! There were three friendly staff behind the counter and one had just brought out a huge, steaming pork butt, which was black and crusty with smoky bark. I watched as he demolished it to make pulled pork. We had a lively discussion about how perfect it looked, smelled, and shredded, and I admired this beautifully fatty masterpiece. I said that I was so sorry that I had already eaten lunch, but that I'd be back. I almost made it to the door, when I knew that I just HAD to have at least a sandwich, He prepped it for me with plenty of fatty & lean pork plus a good helping of bark! WOW! What a huge sandwich, and the flavor was perhaps the best I have ever had - even w/o any sauce! I packed up half, only to find that my truck was still running (Remember, I was just stopping in to see the place, not eat!). I have raved about this place ever since to my foodie colleagues and even to perfect strangers! Friendly service w/ superior BBQ! You've gotta' give them a try ASAP! Then you can write your own 5-Star review!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch after my flight. The place is small but clean, and I received a friendly greeting when I walked in the door. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with slaw, and a sid of mac & cheese. The sandwich was delicious, good smoke flavor and moist. The slaw was just how I like it, cold, juicy, and packed with zest. Sadly the mac & cheese was mediocre, so much room for improvement."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great little spot!  Was in the mood for something different for lunch today and did a Yelp! search.  JL Smokehouse popped up in my area.  I jumped in the car ran down to place an order to go and was back in the office in less than 10 minutes!  The food was absolutely delish!  I am very bias when it comes to greens and much to my surprise the greens were wonderful!  I could have ordered just the greens and been satisified, but I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the macaroni and cheese (they did not have cabbage today)!  Again, my taste buds were having a party in my mouth.  The Mac & Cheese has a pleasant heat at the end of each bite!  And, the pulled pork was smoked just right!  I will be going back again very very soon!  I even sent a co-worker down immediately after my first bite.  I think he enjoyed his meal too!  :o)"}
{"text":"Found my new BBQ spot. So far I have tried the Brisket and the Pulled Pork sandwich. It was some of the best bbq I've had in a long time. Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"I was driving home from work late last week and spotted it, just east of 16th St on the N. side of Broadway. Mental - note, must stop on the way in to work...which I did, today.   The first thing I've learned to do with a new BBQ operation is to ask what's gone for the day. That way, I don't get my hopes-up for something that's unavailable at that time. Today, they were out of chicken, pulled-pork, and burnt ends. The adorable young lady at the counter didn't miss a beat, but did check with Mr. JL on one to be sure. She also willingly offered a taste of my sides so that I made the best decision. She said that the greens were the result of her very own labor, LOL, so I definitely chose those. Then, I hit her up for a taste of the mac-n-cheese and the potato salad. Either one is likely the best I've ever had in a BBQ restaurant. The mac-n-cheese was thick and hot, and the salad cold and crisp. The latter won me over, even though I'm not a fan of potato salad, whether mustard-based, or mayo-based. This is unique, with a pinkish sort of color to the blend. There's some bite left in the taters, and crunch left in the veggies, that really let it stand out. Seriously, I could eat a small tub of it, alone, LOL.    I settled on the three-meat deal, as in reviewer one's choice. I asked JL if the brisket was lean or fatty, and was pleased to hear the latter. In fact, he asked me if I wanted the rare-end or the burnt-end, and I chose the burnt. The link sausage and ribs rounded me out. ( But, they did manage to scrape me up a nice little scoop of burnt-ends out of the tray.) Yes, the meat stands deliciously alone, I agree. However, whenever you get burnt, well....lets say the sauce helps tender it up a it. Their sauce is the ONE thing I found wanting, just a wee bit, for ME. I've always had BBQ with 'thicker' sauces, no matter the place/source. I see this is a watery, vinegar based Carolina wet sauce. It's good, don't get me wrong. However, to me it was like settling for a Coke, when you're a hardcore Pepsi-fan. Yes, that is their one-and-only choice of sauce, too.   While there is a few tiny tables inside at which to eat, think of this as more of a take-out destination. Perhaps they have plans on some more seating, but I don't where they'd fit a patio, considering the location. As it was, I was JUST able to make it to work on time. I put a little smattering of everything together onto a plate for a co-worker of mine to try, and he was also impressed. Even then, I barely finished mine off and was quite satisfied. From a BBQ perspective, I feel it's a great value for the price. JL's will be my new go-to for BBQ, henceforth."}
{"text":"Hi, we went to try the smoked baloney sandwich and ended up buying brisket and pulled pork too. with out a doubt the best smoked meats I have ever had. The owner was fantastic and welcoming. The mac & cheese reminded me of my grandma's when real cheese was/is used."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Place was slightly busy.   Food: I ordered the straddling the fence, which includes 3 meats and 2 sides.  #1 - ribs - too dried, salty, not a lot of flavor on its own. Their bbq sauce that they do have is \"watery\" and just doesn't do it any good. Tasteless. Bland. Even the bbq sauce could not save the ribs. Maybe they had an off day. I'm not sure.  #2 - brisket - dried. like real dried. meat well fall apart, but not in the good away. flavor = salty #3 - pulled pork - probably the only ok meat that day, but I have had better elsewhere.  **you can't double up on same meat as well** Sides: -potato salad - edible, but doesn't make you crave it again.  -mac and cheese - pretty decent.   **Incident: They lost my order on the paper they he hand writes down about 10 mins into waiting. They had to retake my order. I had to wait even longer** Service: They were nice about it, but another star off.    Price: Pricey. $18.46 total with tax. If the meats were good, then the price would be justifiable. But not today.   Parking: enough around the building given the limited seating.   Environment: home feeling on inside. Restroom has a shower??. More of hole in wall feel then upscale interior.  Limited seating.  Overall:  Would not come back here for awhile or possibly ever.  Other bbq places to try in AZ."}
{"text":"If you live in Scottsdale or North Phoenix, it's a really long drive. There are many bbq places closer and almost as good. However that's not to say it's not worth it. But it's not ay yay yay. We had 5 meats and 3 sides and most were good to very good. Food rundown: Ribs meaty and exceptional. Nice bark and a little tug Pulled pork puts Naked bbq to shame. Moist and not dry.  Brisket just good.Not much bark and fatty but not in a great way Bologna was just a hunk of meat slightly charred. Smoked sausage was a glorified hot dog. Sides good slaw, beans were terrific and the potato salad tasteless. Summarizing if you order the Ribs and pulled pork beans and cole slaw, you will be very happy. The peach cobbler looked great but too filled to indulge. Prices are very reasonable and the people working were efficient. But JL Smokehouse ain't no Little Miss Q."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. My husband got the three meats and two sides meal and I ordered the half slab of ribs. Ribs had a good char and smoke flavor. No sauce needed because they were that good. He got the pulled pork and I ended up sneaking a lot off his plate because that pork was so delicious. Brisket was nice and fatty. He also got the bbq beans and potato salad, both he said were very good. The owner is awesome too, so nice. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The brisket is to die for. The macaroni and cheese is ridiculously good as well, home style (no Velveeta style cheez sauce over here!) The mac is baked and has a little kick to it, which is welcome for a spice wimp like me. Brisket + Mac = PURE HEAVEN. Yaaas! The brisket and the mac are all I have had from here, but I am sure the rest of the menu is wonderful as well. I can't wait to order again, but that mac and brisket was so good I just may have to stick with my ol faithful. I just order from grubhub. One day I will make it in to the actual restaurant. Til then, I will enjoy the convenience of having it delivered to my home where I can kick my feet up and be a glutton while nobody watches. You go, JL!"}
{"text":"GET HERE NOW.   This is a hidden gem in the BBQ world here in Phoenix. I had the Heavy Hitter and it did not disappoint. 5 meats and 3 sides and they were all great.  The pulled pork was the best I have ever had.  Ribs were perfect.  Only bad part was that we got here late and they were out of brisket. Which is a sign of good bbq. It means they do not reheat. Once they run out of what the cooked they are out for the day.  It gives me an excuse to come back soon."}
{"text":"JL smokehouse is love at first bite.  Been there twice in two weeks.  The brisket has a balanced level of saltiness and precise bark.  The spare ribs are a festival of flavor for your taste buds and pull off the bone perfectly.  The bbq beans have the perfect level of spiciness and the greens accompany any meat in proper tandem.  JL and his crew are friendly and welcoming and answer questions with an open book.  If you want a fake bbq joint where you have a table side server with tired, bland bbq go elsewhere. If you want real southern and Texas style bbq in its truest form in a humble but welcoming environment, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Well, this place amazingly proved to me that you don't have to go to Kansas City to get fabulous top-notch BBQ. My wife and I, along with our son, were looking for some great bbq after mediocre bbq the previous night at a chain restaurant. This place far surpassed all of our expectations. So for meats we tried the brisket, the chicken, and the sausage. For sides we went with baked beans, Mac-n-cheese, and cabbage. Without exception, everything we tried was mouthwateringly delectable. While we only visit Arizona once a year, visiting this place will be on our list every year for sure. The 2 brothers who run the place were very welcoming and a pleasure to talk to. So whatcha waiting for? Get down to JL's and experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"Great authentic Arkansas BBQ. The owner JL makes a mean pulled pork.  Probably my favorite.  The prices are really reasonable and the food was delicious.  I liked the heat in the Mac and cheese and beans."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some good 'ol BBQ today and wanted something I could pick up on my way home from work.   A quick Yelp search yielded JL Smokehouse, so I decided to stop in to see what this place was all about.     Upon arriving, I was immediately greeted by a wonderful smoky bbq aroma and very friendly and boisterous JL behind the counter.  He gave me a rundown on his southeast roots and with me being from NC and having sampled a lot of good BBQ in my years there and here in AZ, we quickly connected.    The menu is easy - pulled pork, chicken, smoked sausage, hot links, ribs, rib tips, beef brisket and a couple of less usual items like bbq bologna and ALENE, all of which you can either do as a sandwich or on a platter, accompanied by a few delicious sounding sides and peach cobbler for folks with a hankering for something sweet.    I opted for the \"Straddling the Fence\" platter, which is three meats of your choice & two sides.  For me, what sounded right today was ribs, brisket and smoked sausage plus mac & cheese and bbq beans.  I opted for the sauce on the side (instead of poured over the meat) and boy am I glad I did!   The flavor of the meat was just outstanding without even needing sauce, I was very pleasantly surprised.  I find that a lot of bbq requires being doused in sauce to really get the desired flavor, but JL's bbq was exploding with flavor all on it's own.  I definitely suggest getting your sauce on the side if you're doing takeout.    The huge ribs were tender, had a great smoky flavor and were AMPLE at 3 ribs to my order.  While I dipped them in the sauce a little, they really didn't need it.  Next up was the huge portion of beef brisket.  I am not usually a brisket fan, typically preferring bbq pork, but man oh man was this brisket melt-in-your mouth good.  I didn't touch the sauce because the meat just didn't need it!   Just fatty enough, this brisket was really, really good.   I would definitely order this again.   Next, smoked sausage -- again, no need for sauce -- it was incredible.   The smoky flavor and perfect texture were just what the doctor ordered.  Awesome, awesome sausage.   Finally, the mac & cheese was good, but the bbq beans were GREAT.     I was very happy with my choices today, and I look forward to returning - next time I will try the pulled pork, chicken and hot links.    Really happy to have found JL Smokehouse!   Update 8/2/17:  Finished up my leftovers for dinner last night.   Yep, I got two complete meals out of that platter!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Decided to give it a try based on all of the reviews. I was NOT disappointed. Great food and James is a great host! I will be back! Be sure to try to potato salad."}
{"text":"Pulled pork and brisket are amazing and the staff is friendly. Highly recommend this BBQ place."}
{"text":"I walked in a stranger and walked out feeling like I had known them my whole life. These are some of the warmest, kind hearted, genuine people I have ever spoken to. Its no wonder, theyre from AK (TX girl here) and are the epitome of southern hospitality. Now, lets get to the food shall we? I got the \"whippersnapper\" which is two meats and one side, but only having a small amount of mac left they just gave it to me and offered me another side on the house, i decided on greens. For the meats I chose rib tips and brisket. The brisket was flavorful with a nice smoke ring and melt in your mouth tender, the rib tips had a great crusty charry bark on the outside and the meat was also very tender and moist. The bbq sauce was great but honestly, the meats stood up on their own without sauce, the test of true great bbq. The mac n cheese was better than the standard bbq fare, it had depth to it, not just a simple velveeta cheese sauce there. The greens were maybe my favorite thing on the plate, they were so flavorful, smoky & savory without even a hint bitterness. The portions were so generous this will be dinner and breakfast for sure. They also gave me a complimentary mini peach pie that smells amazing and Im sure will help get me through my overnight shift tonight. I am so happy to have stumbled upon this gem and hope they continue to thrive off awesome word of mouth from their many loyal (now +1) customers!! Thanks guys, see you very soon :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome!  My husband and I are in town from Seattle and came across JL's. We came in hungry and left happy. I haven't had BBQ this good since my days in Texas. JL's portions are generous and you can tell he has a love and passion for what he does.  We're trying to convince him to open up a BBQ joint in Seattle. If ever we find ourselves in Phoenix again, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Off the hook surprise... wow. This year I traveled to 26 states mostly through the South.   From The Carolinas..Georgia, Florida Alabama Mississippi Texas And New Mexico... I ate BBQ the whole way..... This is the best place to eat some Awesome BBQ JL has real talent for smoking meat."}
{"text":"Took some clients here for lunch. They loved it. Great food. One thing you want to make sure you have enough time. It takes a little while to get food, but totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Bar-B-Q I've ever had in my life. The owner is so down to earth and cool. He showed my coworker and I his BBQ Pit which was quite educational. I wish this place was closer because I'd be eating there all the time. I had the pulled pork which he said would be the best I'd ever have... The man knows his BBQ because it sure as hell was."}
{"text":"JL is a super cool dude who makes you feel like you just walked into his kitchen (which, I guess, I kinda did). Great ambiance of hospitality and classic southern charm in a hole in the wall BBQ joint (my kind of place). Burnt Ends were spectacular and took me back to my KC roots (get 'em on the regular menu, JL!) Sauce was not my 'fav, but with JL's obvious passion for the art of BBQ, I'm guessing he'll concoct some alternate sauce creations soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. Its black family owned so of course I went out of my way to support. All of their meats were on point! Even though, I would like a spicer hot link and they we out of ribs. However, the rib tips they did have...Jesus! I wasn't upset anymore! They also let you sample the sides before you purchase which is an awesome business practice. Just get there early!!!"}
{"text":"Welp, hands down my new favorite barbecue place. Always feels great supporting the small businesses. All the beef meats are incredible. Not a pork eater...this place is early. Come early for the cobbler."}
{"text":"This place has everything I look for in a legit bbq restaurant! It smells like a smoker, meat is by the pound or in a sandwich, nice platters, the meat has an amazing bark, great flavor. The rub and the meat do all the work, the sauce just adds a little extra. Go to this place before everyone else realizes how great it is!"}
{"text":"Legit BBQ, great music, awesome service and relaxed atmosphere!  Sat with the owner and chatted like we were good friends."}
{"text":"We read the reviews of this restaurant and knew we had to go there. It is quite a drive from Gilbert but well worth it.  I am from Memphis and am always in search of barbecue that tastes like home. JL Smokehouse is the best barbecue west of the Mississippi River.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and my husband had the beef barbecue tips sandwich. Both were excellent! Their barbecue sauce is delicious. We also had  an order of beans. They are very spicy!  The restaurant has five or six tables and the walls are covered with messages from  all of their happy customers.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Wow. James is so friendly and accommodating. We sat and had a conversation about where he's from and how he cooks. He let me sample the greens to be sure I liked them. I ordered them along with a rib sandwich. The flavors of both were great.  I will be returning for sure.   Update.... I've been back 2 more times having rib tips, brisket, and the pulled pork. Oh, and Mac and cheese. Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing! The best BBQ I've ever had in my life! The menu is simple and so reasonably priced! The quality of the meat is top notch! I can't wait to try it again. I'm a huge fan and will be telling everyone I know looking for good BBQ to come here! You won't be disappointed I promise! The owner is so nice and friendly too! I love when I see someone pouring their heart into something that they love. You can tell this is his passion. I love it!"}
{"text":"Great food very satisfied Great service staff exceptional I felt great experience I hope you give it a try and enjoy as i did."}
{"text":"JL Smokehouse is the bomb.com!  We love this place!  JL cooks with love and you can taste it!  This is the best BBQ you will find in Phoenix and our whole family loved it!"}
{"text":"Just fantastic. Needed a brisket on short notice and JL jumped in and helped out. Brisket was fantastic. Beautiful smoke ring, moist, not overly fatty, and with great bark. Greens were even better. Plus, JL and team could not have been any friendlier. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"For the unacquainted, this is that hole in the wall that a few discover, the word spreads and an empire begins. I've had barbecue all over the world and that of course includes all parts of the United States with all variations being experienced. Barbecue is a very personal experience for the pit master and the customer. You know what you want and you know what's ok, better, good, great, excellent and now JL's (Just Love) Smokehouse. JL as he is affectionately known, is that hidden jewel that has been discovered and is just now starting what will no doubt be, a meteoric rise. This man started with a street stand two hours a day in Scottsdale on weekdays only. His barbecue was so good, the established restaurants banded together and had him pushed out of their town. No matter, as he now has a small unassuming location that is a melting pot of all races and socioeconomic classes eating together with little no talking, just eating. My hubby and I ordered his largest platter with 5 different meats and 3 sides, nothing disappointed and everything was a new experience in what I've been missing in barbecue my entire life! After trying each and every delectable bite of meat, I had to ask, \"Will this also be the best I've had?\" The answer after each and every new morsel was \"Yes!\" Famous Dave's is for those who don't realize just what they are missing. JL's is for the lucky few that are now growing, get there at 11:00am right when they open, or they may not have anything left, yes it's that good!"}
