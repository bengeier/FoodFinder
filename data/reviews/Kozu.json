{"text":"The food is missing taste. It's like the cook doesn't know much about Asian food. Mostly over price. Asked for the bun to be cut so that we can share and the waiter says no they cannot. My friends and I actually went to eat at Imadake right after leaving that place and we ate sooooo much better! Not even comparable."}
{"text":"I am surprisingly impressed by this restaurant/cocktail bar. It was my first time there and I had no idea what to expect. First, we arrived around 8h30 om a thursday and with no reservation. They managed to find us a place for 3 people although the place was full. It took some time to get our menus but given that the place was packed I can mildly understand. After ordering my first drink \"kung fu panda\" which was delicious, the service got better with our waiter. The shared plates were really exquisite and they come with 4 pieces each so since we were 3, one person had the pleasure of eating 1 more. Around 10pm the place was now a lounge with people standing on the bar with good music(a mix of hiphop, old school and Trap) Overall, I loved it and would love to go back again soon. Thanks"}
{"text":"La première impression du Kozu est que c'est franchement magnifique... jusqu'à temps qu'on nous dise que la seule place disponible est devant la cuisine! Vraiment moins impressionnant. On manque toute l'ambiance si jolie et feutrée. Vous aurez compris qu'il est important de réserver haha Les cocktails étaient vraiment très bons.  Comme plats, nous en avons choisi quatre. Quantité raisonnable pour deux personnes, mais les plats sont excessivement chers pour les portions servies.  Nous avons commencé avec les Dim Sum au poulet et les rouleaux aux canards. Rien à dire, simplement parfait! Nous avons ensuite pris le satay de poulet et le hamachi popcorn. Encore une fois délicieux.  Le service était aussi excellent. Bref, pour une soirée entre amis et surtout une date, l'ambiance est géniale."}
{"text":"Fun food that's as delightful to look at as it is to eat. The size of the dishes are perfect for ordering a ton to share so that you can have a little of everything - my favourite way to dine. My favourite dishes are the soft shell crab bao, the steamed vegetable dumplings, the cucumber salad, the spare ribs and the duck rolls. And of course, the ambiance is gorgeous - warm, inviting, and whimsical. Amazing addition to the Plateau!"}
{"text":"From the owners of Tiradito, comes this Asian food temple. These guys never fail to impress! I discovered Kozu on Eater - yesterday, June 15th, was its official opening. With a little over 3 weeks opening - this venue was great, cozy and not over crowded with people. Greens all around with a summer air. I made reservations though open table (wouldn't recommend it -I wanted a table but got placed at the bar - still great experience).  Service was top notch, with a great variety of drinks and items on the menu. Most foods are great to share for a palatal enriching experience. Chef Olivier Vignault had wonderful surprises - Prices ranging from 15-25$  Review out of five stars: I ordered the: Sui Jin bao dumplings (steamed pork dumplings  came in 4) ****, kozu slaw (mango, papaya salad- I enjoyed this salad much better than the Asian salad at Park sushi)***, oven- roasted black cod with a miso marinate*****,  soft-shell crab bao (served as 2 pieces) ***, grilled sesame chicken **.   For drinks I tried - Konrad gaze (old fashioned style) *****and malaca sour (pisco sour like drink) ***. Kudos to Marco our bartender!  We ended up getting the bill in a box with a fortune cookie, so original!   Compliments to David and the team for adding another great venue to the Montreal food map. looking forward to the next!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Came earlier today and waited 15 minites and still nobody came to see us. Decided to leave! Disappointed"}
{"text":"I was romanced by their beautiful Instagram and stylish decor.  However, we left underwhelmed.  We had wonderful service when we were first seated and our delicious cocktails came swiftly. We then ordered 5 plates knowing they were small. Within the first 35 minutes of being there, we had 1 cocktail and 1 of 5 plates (the duck confit rolls). The final 4 came all at once, 25 minutes later with little service(chicken wings, hamachi, siu mai, and now that I'm writing this I realize we never got the roasted cauliflower we ordered). The flavors were good, but nothing to write home about.  We loved the space and the cocktails but not sure I would recommend it for a meal when there are so many finer options."}
{"text":"My social foodie group and I decided to try out Kozu, an Asian-inspired bar-restaurant on Plateau Mont-Royal on Friday which opened this past summer by the same group behind Mayfair, Kampai, Fitzroy, and Flyjin (none of which impressed). What actually attracted me to this spot was the chef; Olivier Vigneault is also chef at Jatoba, this Asian-inspired eatery in the heart of downtown whose menu never disappointed me.  Starting off, we tried various cocktails; I ordered the Kung Fu Panda to start, made with rum, brandy, cinnamon and anise syrup, lime and egg white, and followed with the Malacca Sour, made with scotch, five spice, lime and egg white. The cocktails, much like their names, were fun, flavorful and not too strong, so overall great!  As for the food, we decided to go with the group menu which included a variety of dishes from edamame, to dumplings, papaya salad, salmon poke bowl, to chicken bao buns; over 12 dishes (if my memory serves well after those cocktails) for almost 45$ and it was well worth the price. Besides a BBQ pork dish which I found a little tough, the rest of the dishes were nicely executed, flavorful and just plain delicious. The portions of those sharing plates, may I add, were very generous and left us more than satisfied. Even though we were full, we couldn't resist trying the desserts; I opted for the praline and chocolate cake which was just stupendous!    Kudos to this place for the service which was quick and attentive; we had two members with dietary restrictions dining with us and the multitude of staff serving us were all aware and kindly explained all dishes while being served, and pointed out the ones that of our guests couldn't have; they even changed up the menu for us offer more vegetarian dishes and seafood options for the same price.  The space was very modern and chic with dark tones, marble, oak, black leather banquettes and a beautiful long bar while the ambience was festive and young; so very elegant but more relaxed than the classier Jatoba.  In all, I loved the high-end and modern cuisine, the beautifully decorated space, the friendly and efficient service and of course, the yummy cocktails. I would totally return to Kozu!"}
{"text":"I came here on a double date Friday night at 6:45 pm. I liked the vibe and I liked the decor. The food was very good! The only thing I didn't like was that basically they told us we had to leave after two hour later because someone else reserved the table that we were at.   My boyfriend got kung fu panda rum based cocktail. It was good! A bit girly looking for him but tasted great! They didn't have the gin cocktail on the menu available so I opted for a Bloody Caesar and it was good enough that I got a second.   My boyfriend and I shared the edamame which was delicious! Its so simple but it was one of our favourites of the night. We devoured the bowl in no time. It had Yuzu powder and wasabi salt on top. You really didn't taste the wasabi. It tasted to me like corn on the cob with salt on top. So good!  We also shared the sushi pizza, popcorn hamachi and the Kozu tataki since these were recommended by the waitress. Out of the three our favorite was the sushi pizza. It had red tuna with avocado cream, tempura,shiso, marinated red jalapeño and cucumber. I really enjoyed the jalapeño on top. It gave it a bit of a kick. The hamachi was deep fried in Panko and wrapped in a Boston lettuce. The tataki was salmon and tuna with gold Yukon chips, sesame and ponzu sauce.   We also got the fried chicken bao. I wish the piece of chicken was bigger. It was a lot more bao than I would have liked. I've had better bao buns elsewhere.   I would come back and try their other dishes. Our friends got the duck roll and they loved it but we were too full to order more food. We will definitely be back!!"}
