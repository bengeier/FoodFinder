{"text":"The good: Amazing view, very friendly staff (though service was slow).  The bad: Literally the worst food I've ever eaten, and I'm not one of those people who doesn't understand what \"literally\" means and says it every day. By literally, I mean that it was actually the worst thing I can recall eating in my entire life.   I can't figure out for the life of me how you could possibly get a chicken breast so chewy and rubbery and tendon/plastic-like. I've undercooked chicken and I've overlooked chicken many times - it was never nearly this gross.   My brother's veal was tough and chewy, though when he tasted my chicken after we argued who's was worse he spit it out, laughed and conceded.  My sister had a special, Beef Wellington, and it tasted great. My mom had another special, a salmon pasta dish that she liked a lot. Meatball appetizer was pretty good. My wife's scallops were okay.   Even with those positives, I can't bring myself to give it more than one star. I've never eaten a worse entree.  The saddest part about the meal for me is that I'll probably never get to the bottom of the chicken mystery. I'm so genuinely curious how to make chicken feel like that."}
{"text":"The views can't be beat, the food was Amazing & the triple Chocolate cake best chocolate cake I've ever had. Service was prompt zero complaints."}
{"text":"We called at 8:00 p.m. on the 4th of July and made a 9:00 reservation. I just mentioned that we were hoping to see fireworks while we ate.  We had just been rained out of our Kennywood plans and then spent a while in traffic. We finally got up the mountain, but were about 30 minutes late because we hit more traffic. When I called, they said they would continue to hold the table. My husband and I and three kids were led to the most beautiful table right in front of their floor to ceiling windows. The dining room was full, and yet they saved the most desirable table for us, who were late. That is phenomenal service. Our server was knowledgable and competent. His description of the specials was amazing and we barely ordered anything from the regular menu. The grilled peach and prociutto appetizer was my favorite. My husband and son went nuts over the stuffed banana peppers. There house chardonnay was a nice surprise, though I didn't get a chance to ask what it was. It tasted expensive. It is an expensive restaurant, but their servings were larger than many other restaurants. I did not finish my lobster ravioli. My husband, a BIG eater, did not finish his wellington. My my 5 year old fell asleep after the fireworks and missed out on her pasta with alfredo sauce, which was quite sophiticated for a child. (I hate it when restaurants don't try hard with a kid's dish--my daughter apperciates quality too.) The other kids (teenagers) had stuffed salmon and stuffed shrimp and we all gawked at the generous crab stuffing. Everyone enjoyed the french onion soup. My salad was sufficient. The view of the fireworks was spectacular! Gratuity was included on our check, which I don't really like, but I guess I understand. We actually tipped above that anyway. I teared up on the way home because it had been so close to a disaster of a day right to the point of being seated at our table... My husband and I decided it was the best day ever based on the turn-around at the Bella Vista. We will be back for other holidays, birthdays... Whatever excuse I can use to get back. I love Bella Vista! I wish I could give them more stars."}
{"text":"We didn't have food. We just had a drink there before dinner. Prices are reasonable for such a wonderful view. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The staff was very cordial, the food was delicious and of course, the view was amazing. If you want a quaint casual fine dining experience, this is the place to be. Family owned and very intimate. The beef wellington and chicken Rockefeller was very good."}
{"text":"First and Foremost, The view from this restaurant is like nothing else. The three rivers and downtown are right outside your window. I would go here and eat shitty food and pay $20 extra just to see the view. This would be great for a romantic date.  Secondly, the food was amazing. I went here with a friend and her parents whom I had never met before, and I am so thankful they brought me to this place. I had a salmon and crab dish and even though I was stuffed I couldn't stop eating because it was just that good. I tried everyone else's dishes and theirs were also very good.  They had a martini list that we ordered from and enjoyed, also.  P.S. To all the people on here trashing their chicken parm, who gets chicken parm at a nice restaurant? Check yoselves."}
{"text":"Likely the worst restaurant in this price range I have ever been to anywhere in the world. Million dollar views.  Just spectacular view of the beautiful city of Pittsburgh.  But seriously substandard food.  I expect overpriced wine, but a $15 bottle of wine for $98 is a stretch.  There really wasn't anything noteworthy about the meal. Chewy calamari, average salad.  I had a $40 strip steak for my entree that I would honestly say was Golden Corral quality.  Chewy. Very chewy.  Not flavorful.  My guess is frozen and likely a substandard commercial cut.  Ok, my bad.  I should have instead had $30 spaghetti.  But, objectively, this place wouldn't  be in business if not for the view.  I walked out wondering if every restaurant on that hill was this bad, or if we just happened to be unlucky. Fortunately, I was with terrific friends and we enjoyed the views."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a place to celebrate our anniversary. We waited a bit too long to get reservations at some of our favorite restaurants and were excited to try some place new. Unfortunately, after spending nearly $200 on a few drinks, dinner, and dessert, we both regretted our decision of trying Bella Vista.   We had reservations and were seated close to our dining time. There were no window seats available, but the hostess offered us the choice to wait for one. We declined, but it was nice to be given the option.   My husband ordered a salmon special. His salmon was not cooked the whole way through and he said the risotto had mandarin oranges chopped up throughout it. He didn't care for his meal. I had the lobster ravioli which was good, but $40 for 5 raviolis?!? That's a little much!   We each ordered a dessert - carrot cake for me. Mine was pretty dry. The husband ordered a triple chocolate cake which was huge and he really liked.  On a positive note, we did have a good server (Chris, I believe).  This is off of our list for future visits. I will make a mental note that there's probably a good reason why a restaurant has open reservations the day before you want to go on a Saturday in May."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place very well. It's definitely on the expensive side, but I've had the beef wellington special, and the surf and turf, and some of the veal.  It was all excellent.  The view is amazing.  I can definitely imagine that some stuff is great here, while others isn't.  I would recommend to always order one of the specials."}
{"text":"The management and service Greatly misrepresented a la carte items and charged $30 for a 1/2 carafe for a Mondavi merlot when she said it would be $15.00.   Told there was a SMALL  up charge from the included house salad to the caprese salad.   Small was $9.00 each.  Mgt refused to make it right.  Go if you are a gambler. You can see the casino from this point.  But don't bet on winning here."}
{"text":"The two stars are strictly for the view. Great view of the three rivers and downtown. The decor is okay. The food is overpriced. The bread reminds me of white Wonderbread with Italian crust. The salad was ok. The dressing was good. The olives were canned olives and the tomato was old. The soup was so-so. The veal piccata was ok...a little bland. The chicken parmesan tasted like chicken and ketchup   Dessert was pretty bad. Creme brûlée was really runny and not even caramelized on top. The $10 chocolate cake was cold and actually tasted like a refrigerator. Service was fair at best. I had to constantly ask for refills on my iced tea.  Oh, did I mention a great view of the city?  We won't be going back here. We'll need to check out a different Mt Washington restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Id like for you to make a Correction. We were 5 minutes early and for the half hour your referring to was the time we sat awaiting for a waitress to greet us. The manager was requested not volunteering showing up to greet us. I'd like to include the un-staff bartenders that my waitress herself made the drinks which I stress again was not upto par. The food was not great and service was horrible. I will not return and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. As for removing items from the bill, why wouldn't you when you managed to get everything wrong with our orders so who in their right mind would pay for it. In conclusion;  your food and service is the worst I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Incredibly overpriced, mediocre food. $40.00 for Chicken Parmesan that in my opinion was no better than the $13 variation at Olive Garden, if not worse. Their strip steak was horribly tough and under cooked (ordered medium and it was cooked blue). Parking is $10.00 across the street. The only positive about the experience was the \"beautiful view.\""}
{"text":"A good view is about the only positive quality I can attribute to this restaurant. Our waitress was also nice.  Let me simply say that, as a former chef, I would be ashamed to serve the substandard food that was put on our table yesterday afternoon.  The fried calamari was close to rare. The meatballs and the bruschetta were cold, stale tasting, and amateurish. The crab stuffed portobello mushrooms were a haphazard goop. The brûléed peaches with prosciutto and mozzarella, while sounding inspired, were mealy and gross.  They still have Xmas decorations up in September. (Or are they anticipating?) The drinks were fine.  The prices for this mess was obscene.  Steer clear.  Go back down the incline and find some real food."}
{"text":"Nice view of the city, but the food was disappointing.  The appetizer meatballs arrived cool in the centers and tasted like something frozen from Costco or Trader Joes.  The bartender had no mint to make drinks that require it.  No wonder the restaurant was almost empty the evening we were there."}
{"text":"I would call this mediocre at best. The view was lovely. The service...meh. The atmosphere, notsomuch. The food was ok, but we got it to go because we were so uncomfortable with the atmosphere. Our bottle of wine was served to another table, and then they didn't have any more of that. And, quite honestly, it felt like we took a step back into 1987. A very expensive meal to eat in our hotel room."}
{"text":"My entire experience in 3 separate visits to Bella Vista   1st time - Delmonico steak, salad and wine. Delicious, no problems at all. Great atmosphere.  2nd time - filet & bruschetta - okaaay food but it was my anniversary with my wife.  During the course of our meal, the chef and hostess/manager got close to literally a physical altercation.  Screaming, dishes breaking.  Silenced the entire restaurant and really ruined the entire mood and evening at the place.  $200   3rd visit.  Brought my mother from Arizona and in-laws.  Service was..okay.  Food was disgusting.   I promise you that Dennys or chilis can cook you a better steak for $10. No questions.  Sent it back because it was cold when it got to me. They heated it up.  ZERO flavor. Zero.  No seasoning. Plain, microwaved baked potato and plain asparagus with oil. Took a single bite...Ive sent three meals in my life back to the kitchen saying i didnt want it and this was one of those times.  Our waiter returns with the $450 bill and states... And I quote \"We took half of your bill because you know, you ate the salad and everything\".  My mothers filet was the same pitiful waste of money, My wifes pasta dry and steak in it overcooked.  Truly an entire waste of time, money and dinner.  1 for 3.  - 33%   So with much regret, I don't know that I will ever return to this restaurant again...  Truly amazing views, but you will have buyers remorse once you receive the bill and realize that the food is in no way on par with the price or professionalism that this place has to offer you.    Basically the atmosphere of a 4 star restaurant with the overall quality of a chilis, applebees or the like."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. Great service from our waiter Chris. We ordered the risotto balls with marinara sauce that were on special for an app. They were really good however there were only two and they were pretty small. The bread and dipping oil came out with our salads which was all good. My salad could have used some more dressing since it was scarce. I ordered the fettuccine pescatore (with no scallops and tomato cream sauce instead of the Alfredo). The meal itself was really good although the pasta had way too much sauce. I tried my fiancées chicken parmigiana and was not that fond of the red sauce. Neither was he. The window view was amazing and the bartender was able to find me an excellent sweet red wine. I finished the meal with a much needed espresso. A little pricey but it seemed like you were paying for the view. Overall a great meal, but I gave it four stars since the red sauce was very questionable which is a little disappointing for a higher end Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing views and food. The service was great on a busy Saturday evening. I had the Chicken Rockefeller and my date had the Chicken Parmesan. Delish. The atmosphere is lovely, and intimate. I'd highly recommend this. We drove over from Cleveland. Totally worth the trip."}
{"text":"Excellent view, a bit dated and a little cramped though. Still, Id go back just for the view.  Staff is very casual but attentive. Beef Wellington (almost always available as a special) for $42 was very good but even so I'm not sure it's worth the money. Cannoli for dessert was good too. In all a satisfying experience. But no valet means $10 for the lot or park far away on a side street."}
{"text":"Disappointing dining experience, given that it was touted by the hotel concierge as a 180-degree opposite to the worst restarant in Pittsburgh (hope the search engines pick up that phrase).  They were overbooked so we waited in the bar and had our drinks and appetizers there.  Those were average.   The veal saltinbocca meat had gone bad and tasted terrible.  They did cheerfully replace it with a meat and cream pasta dish.  It was no better than okay.  The house wine by the glass must have been some watered-down murky mix of cheap leftovers.  Desserts at least were B-grade.  We were just glad it was finally over."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was amazing. I am very hard to please when it comes to food.  Best of all was the ambiance of it all and the beautiful view. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this fine establishment while visiting. Pittsburgh from CALIFORNIA for the Steelers game.  While walking we noticed this restaurant and decided to take a peek inside.  We were sold on the view of the city and of course Heinz Field and hAd a very delicious and elegant time. Service was excellent and very attentive and the food was exceptional as well!! Highly recommend this place and come see their views!!"}
{"text":"Drinks: 4 Decor: 3.5 Ambiance: 4.5 Service: 2 Value: 2  The view is the star here. Good drinks, and meh service."}
{"text":"We held a birthday dinner for my mother here recently, and the staff and ownership were very accomodating as they helped us assemble a special evening.  We were able to procure a table with a phenomenal view on a Saturday evening.  The appetizer dishes were of high quality and very generous in proportion.  While the wine list is a bit small, the selections are broad enough to satisfy most tastes and are reasonably priced.  Entree choices were also excellent and generous.   Overall, we enjoyed a great evening with Mom and wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Beautiful view overlooking the city. Delicious food and huge entree portions. Very intimate location with about a dozen tables but the atmosphere could be improved with dimmed lights and some candles. This is a pricier location and if the atmosphere was improved to feel more intimate/romantic at your table they would get 5 starts from me. Entire staff was friendly."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place!! Such a small romantic restaurant. There is a view of the city from the whole restaurant. I tried the beef Wellington it was PERFECT. They serve pineapples soaked in cream de menthe after dinner it was interesting and delicious! They let us move to a table that was closer to the window when it was available. What at perfect evening. I had such an amazing time with the one that I love."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are new to the neighborhood and like to go to a nice dinner. We made a reservation for 830. They called back about 2 hours later and said they needed us to come in at 8. Well I'm a hairstylist, so that didn't work with my schedule. Hence the reason we made the reservation for 830. After being told we simply could not come at 830, I said we could come later. That wasn't an option either so I asked why?  They are getting ready for a busy weekend so they need to close the kitchen early, and they really don't have any other reservations so they are just going to close early.  Let me guess why you don't have any business on a Friday night.... Probably because you are running off what little business you have. I can't even pass judgement on the food. But they are going to be busy tomorrow, so don't worry about the reservations for today! Let's close at 7!  Pathetic"}
{"text":"Heard about new owners, new chef and new menu so decided to give it a try.  THEEEEE best veal I have ever had.  Veal scallopini Milanese with crab meat.  Unbelievable!!!   You definitely get your money's worth.  Top quality ingredients.  Everyone should give this place a try. You wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"This restaurant is as if Olive Garden opened on Mt Washington and started charging $40 a plate for food.  If you want to overpay for food to have a nice view, there are better options on Mt Washington."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant for our Valentine's Day dinner with friends. We were a group of 8 and we made reservations about a month before. The restaurant is incredibly small. People and tables are packed in the dining area. Luckily the restaurant was only about half full on the evening of our visit. The view of the city is outstanding and the view was the bright spot of the visit. The meals were to come with a baked potato, but they came back to the table about 50 minutes after we placed our order to tell us they were out of potatoes! Out of potatoes? Really? On Valentine's Day? It's potatoes, not caviar. The quality of the food was average, but nothing to write home about. The service was below average. I understand they make many things to order, but we were seated at 7:15 and we got our entrees at 8:40. Food and drinks (from their below average bar, no Tito's? Really?) were very overpriced. I expected to pay a good bit due to the location, but the experience was definitely not worth it. The one thing that really upset our group was the way they billed us. As I mentioned we were a group of 8, four couples. The put everything on one bill and made us figure out who owed what. A good server would have taken care of that for us. I understand they wanted to automatically add their 18% gratuity and I'm fine with that, but 4 separate bills with 18% added would have been just as easy. The group agreed that this is a place we don't need to return to."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this restaurant is amazing. The food was beyond my wildest expectations. The view of the city is beyond words. I am going to make this a regular dinner spot. You need to visit this restaurant before you leave Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I really wanted to like it.  The service was horribly slow.   Ordered the Soprano's pasta but was informed they were out.  Ordered the filet mignon.  Just before serving it I was informed they were out of baked potatoes but would substitute pasta.  I said ok but can I get Alfredo sauce.  Was told only if I pay the upcharge. I declined.  The bread in the basket was stale.  I arrived here at 8:15pm as of 9:20 I still have not received my entree.   I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Make reservations unless you're going to show up at 4 pm like we did.  Gorgeous view of the three rivers, the point, downtown, and the stadiums.  We went here for a special occasion. Expect to throw down some cash but is the view worth it? yes. Does the food live up to the expectation and the view? yes.  Really this was the best food I have eaten in quite some time. I was very happy."}
{"text":"This is the THIRD year in a row that my wife &  I have come to Bella Vista for our anniversary. We've tried a lot of places over the years.  Most of them were ok. A few were not so great; but  up until recently we've never gone to the same place twice!  Bella Vista is the perfect romantic spot.  Great view, great service and above all else, great food.  I've read some of the other reviews for this place, and quite frankly, I think that people miss the point!  I NEVER thought that the service was slow. In a spot like this, it's nice to linger a bit to enjoy the view and ambience with your company!  If you're looking for quick cheap eats, then there are a lot of nice places at the bottom of the hill; but that's not why most people come to Mount Washington to dine.  Bella Vista is not a loud, over the top place.  It's a smaller upscale restaurant.  The hostess was awesome.  Bartender was perfect. Our food from soup and salad through the desert was spot on for the third year!  I plan to come back for years to come.  surffin@msn.com"}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant. Authentic Italian food.  Atmosphere was elegant with a beautiful view of the city. Staff was very attentive and friendly. The food was Amazing - Best Crab Cakes I've ever had! I highly recommend this restaurant and will absolutely return!!!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting much with regards to the food- and the menu is god awful American Italian --biut I came for the view as I had relatives from out of town, my elderly father in law and others. You'll be paying upwards of $40 for diner food. But here's the surprise: usually these sorts of places have very good service. This was a shocker. Reservations for 7:45 and we were seated at 8:30. No one at the bar where we waited for 3/4 hour asked us if we'd like a drink-- that's because there was no bartender !!   Do I go on? It's 9:00 and we just got our wine-- shite chianti; the wine list is abominable... I just can't say any thing else. These are the kinds of restaurants that are an insult to the Italian immigrants everywhere  View was great- the only thing that saved it-- lots of laughter at the table for how poorly we were served."}
{"text":"Like many other Mt. Washington restaurants, Bella Vista presents itself as a sophisticated dining establishment, while serving average food at high prices.  While not terrible, the food selection and quality is indistinguishable from the dozens of other shrimp scampi and chicken piccata type Italian joints throughout the Pittsburgh region that charge half as much for a meal.There are far better selections for Italian food within and around Pittsburgh, but this isn't one of them. The decor of this place is tired, and the service is subpar. It's unfortunate that visitors to our city go to a place like this and leave with the impression that this is the best that we can do."}
{"text":"They were very busy so we made a reservation for 2 at 8 PM Saturday night, even though we wanted 7:30. Still busy when we arrived so we had a drink at the bar ($20 for 2 glasses of wine!) and were seated at about 20 after. The staff was very friendly but they seemed a bit discombobulated. We still had our menus when our appetizer was dropped and this was also before our water was even poured. We had to ask for bread. But, the staff was very warm, friendly, and knowledge about the menu.  The bread came with a homemade dipping sauce that was a bit sweet and a welcome change from your typical olive oil mixture. Shrimp bruschetta was delicious for our appetizer even if the bread was a bit hard. I had salmon over risotto and my friend had steak with mashed potatoes. Each came with house salad to start-I asked for crumbly bleu on mine and incurred a $2.50 upcharge-I don't think I've ever experienced that before at an Italian place. Cheesecake for dessert with raspberry topping, excellent. Despite the busyness all the food came out very quickly.   As the restaurant cleared out we asked a busser if we could move to a table right next to the window to take advantage of the gorgeous views and she happily obliged. The atmosphere, quality of food, and one of a kind views certainly made up for any small mishaps in the service."}
{"text":"As a lot of the reviews suggest, this is a spot for a special occasion. I had my graduation dinner here and it is probably one of the most memorable meals I have eaten in my 23 years of life so far. The decor was cute, sort of a little dated, but in an endearing way. It was still really nice inside and the view I mean...come on.   I got here early with my mom while we waited for the rest of my family and had a super good espresso martini. Then as my family arrived we were seated and began dinner. The waitress was awesome, just attentive enough and was really accommodating. We had such good food, I got 3 lobster tails and they were perfectly prepared.   I could not think of anything I would change about the time I dined here, and I can't wait to go back when my little brother graduates from college just to eat here again! So props to Bella Vista."}
{"text":"We happened on this wonderful location by chance. Its a beautiful classic restaurant with a  view that can't be beat.  We were seated right by the windows to dine by the view of the city lights at a sweet romantic table.  Our server was amazing,  attentive, fun and just wonderful! We both had the chicken parm,  which was  hot, fresh, delicious, and melted in your mouth, and the portion size was huge!   On our way out we stopped and talked to the new chef Joe, and the owners.  Who were also amazing!  They explained they are redoing things and fixing issues that may have been in the past.  Give them a try its worth it!  Thank you for a wonderful meal and a memorable night, we will see you soon"}
{"text":"DO NOT come here if you want to have a larger party/celebration. I am getting married on July 5, 2014 and planning the rehearsal dinner has been the biggest headache of all. Since many friends and family are coming from out of town, we wanted to showcase Pittsburgh on the 4th of July with a great fireworks display and a great restaurant on Mt. Washington (where we live). We attempted to plan our dinner at Bella Vista but Rose, supposedly the events manager, was less than helpful and pleasant.  We kept getting the run around (\"we are busy the holidays, can we discuss prices or even if the cook can do this event after New Year's? \"). After the holidays, we called back mid - January and the same run around but this time, the excuse was for Valentine's Day. We called back end of February.  And guess what, Rose was \"not there\", \"in a meeting\", \"on a call\".......and when we finally were able to speak with Rose, \"can we discuss prices next time? I need to speak with the cook to see if we can do this.\" No Rose. We cannot discuss next time and we are canceling. You have not been helpful and I will never eat at that restaurant.  I am in sales and when someone tells me that they would want to reserve out the whole restaurant,  I would go above and beyond. But Rose, you are an epic failure for your establishment and I will tell everyone that I encounter, never to eat there. Thanks for causing undue stress and frustration while planning my wedding. Thankfully Lidia's was accommodating. And that is how you run a successful business."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I just had to for this place. We called 3 weeks in advance to book reservations for Valentine's Day. The women we spoke to said that she would call to confirm the week of and couldn't give us an exact time which I thought was odd. You either have room for the reservation or you don't. Fast forward to the week of and we don't hear from them so both my fiancé and I call multiple times and not only leave messages but speak with a person who didn't even know about the reservation and said they would call back which they didn't. We called several times more and got no answer. The day of the reservation they finally called about 5 hours before and told my fiancé and I two different terrible excuses as to why we hadn't heard from them. Stay away from this place as they clearly don't know how to manage or operate a business. There are a significant amount of better options on Mt. Washington and Pittsburgh in general. When they asked if we wanted the reservation, needless to say we said No! Nor would we ever be returning.  In order to post I had to give at least one star but it deserves ZERO!"}
{"text":"Best view in the city, romantic atmosphere , and was served a 5star steak & garlic shrimp that was to die for. Very impressed with the service as well. We will be back. Thank you for the great dinner & service:)"}
{"text":"On 4/22/18 a friend came in from DC and wanted to go to Mt. Washington for the view and a nice meal.  Well let me tell you, we both agreed this was the best meal ever.  Food, service, and view fantastic!  Owners were there and could not have been nicer.  Chef came to our table twice to see if we were enjoying our meal.  Pricey but well worth the money.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here for a large party and it was a nice place with a great view, hence the name.  Food was average, nothing fancy. The veal was not very tasty and the chicken parm was good, but neither were worth the price.    Chocolate lava cake was too dry, but the strawberry cheesecake was great.   Just not worth the price for what one gets."}
{"text":"To start off the view is amazing.  The problem is the price.  Their website lies to you as most of their dishes are up about another $8-$10 dollars. That's a huge difference. I find it offensive to charge someone $34 for a chicken parm.  They also explain on the website menu the steak sizes are 10ozs when they are really smaller on the restaurant menu.  I don't like being mislead due to laziness by the owner/manager/or staff to update.  I knew going into the restaurant it was expensive but these are simple Italian dishes with average execution priced way above reasonable which give this restaurant a lower ranking.   Service was good but the food was just average.  Started the night out being told they were already out of dishes and after we ordered a dish off the menu a few minutes before it was served was told they actually did not have that pasta.    We ordered the mussels and calamari which was good.  Asked it to be spicy but only got 4 rings of banana peppers in it so really no spice to the sauce.    Ordered the sopressa fillet, fillet stuffed with prosc and cheese in a Marsala sauce.  Very misleading, this I can tell you was no fillet.  It was pounded so thin that if it was a fillet it removed all of the flavor. At $40 it was grossly overcharged also.    We also ordered soprano pasta which is fillet with mush, gorg and mufalda pasta on a cream sauce.  I again do not believe this was fillet as the steak was chopped in dices and then cooked which kills the flavor and the sauce was extremely watery.  Cook the fillet whole and then slice, keeps the integrity of the steak.  I'm not a cream sauce guy to begin with but it should be creamy not watery.  My GF ordered this dish but I had to eat it since she did not like it.    All in all I will try another restaurant simply due to the low quality of food and the extreme price.  1 martini, 1 soda, 1 app, 2 dinners  $120 for 2 people not including tip we should receive high quality food but we did not.    Sorry I will spend my money elsewhere, the view is not worth that."}
{"text":"I came here as a surprise dinner.  It was the first time I came to a restaurant such as this. And by that I mean: dressy, quiet, calm music, romantic, and just all around beautiful.  Our dinner was candlelit. I don't remember much about the food because I was just in complete awe, basically the whole dinner. He made reservations, and requested a window seat. I was expecting fancy, but not as fancy as I got.   It was dark when we arrived, so when I finally sat down, I noticed this is why he demanded sitting here. I had a whole look of the city and river, lit up. The most memorable view I'll never forget. Absolutely gorgeous. And I'm completely thankful I was able to experience this, just the view and setting itself is all I can remember. So you know it must have been outstanding."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Bella Vista for my mother's 89th birthday. I called and made reservations for a Wednesday night. I asked if the restaurant was handicapped accessible and they said there was one small step to get into the door. My mother was able to navigate the step with her walker and they had a table by the window waiting for us. They were not busy this night,  so the room was quiet and we were able to have a normal conversation at the table. We all ordered different things from the menu and their nightly specials. Everyone's meal arrived at the same time and all the meals were hot and delicious! The desserts were good too! I was a bit skeptic about the restaurant from other reviews but our experience was wonderful."}
{"text":"I went here for a special occasion with a date.  The reviews had me a bit skeptical, not to mention the not-very-friendly-guy-on-the-phone, through whom I made the reservation.  But I'm happy to say we not only loved the view, the lady who served our table was particularly friendly, and the food was quite good; though a bit low quality for the price.  The one complaint I have is that our table was frustratingly close to a fairly loud family, but this kind of tight seating certainly isn't unique to this establishment.  All in all, not the best meal I've ever had, but I'd call it a solid spot for a romantic or special occasion."}
{"text":"My family and I came in from eastern pa for the weekend, having gone to Pitt (a long time ago) I was anxious for my kids to see the city. What better way than dinner on Mt. Washington? It was last minute and we had limited options but Bella Vista was accommodating.  We arrived early and got a great table with a spectacular view. The service, ambiance, and most importantly; food, were all phenomenal.  From appetizer to dessert, we were not disappointed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a wonderful overall dining experience in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"First off.... \"What a view\"...I went here at night time, the city lights were really cool.  Go P-Burg!  I thought the food was great!  I got some form of pasta with some form of steak tips... It was really good.  The inside of the restaruant wasn't very fancy, but it was quaint."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for Mother's Day. We didn't ask for a window table, but were given one anyway which was nice. Our server was very new but very kind and accommodating, even when she wasn't sure about the restaurant's policies. The food was great! And every menu item we ordered came out in a neat and timely fashion. After dinner we ordered dessert and coffee. Only about 5 minutes later, ANOTHER server came to take our dishes and our half-full coffee cups and drop off our bill in the same motion. Our original server came back and reluctantly asked if we wouldn't mind finishing our coffees at the bar. I suppose they were trying to give our table to someone else, but it's unacceptable to kick a paying customer out of their seats and \"finish up at the bar\" especially when they are paying TOP DOLLAR for food and service. Very disrespectful, and they should be ashamed of this treatment. Stop chasing away what customer base you have by doing crap like this. We will not be back."}
{"text":"As a frequent diner here I can say its one of Mt Washington's best. The view is unbeatable and I've never had a bad meal. My wine and dessert suggestions from the staff have always been spot on as well. We seem to always have the same great waiter as well, no complaints all around!"}
{"text":"I took my dad there for his 79th birthday and it was wonderful. We were seated right near the window for a view that was breathtaking.  The food was exquisite. It is very pricey but was so worth the experience"}
{"text":"View is amazing. Service was 4 star and food and pricing were 2 star. We had angel hair pesto with chicken for $28.00 and pasta was overlooked and just ok. Service was great though so overall with the view was nice"}
{"text":"Hey Pittsburgh, there's a new Italian chef in town and, get this, he's Polish!!  If last night's meal was indicative of his skills and imagination with Italian cuisine Chef Joe Something-ski at Bella Vista is a bona fide stud!!  3.5 stars?! Maybe that's carried over from the last chef because Chef Joe is strictly 5 star all the way!!!  Charcuterie: superb Salad: superb Veal Parmesan: superb Salmon: superb Crab Cakes: superb Caramel Gelato: superb  Notice a pattern here?!  Run don't walk to Bella Vista while you can still get a table.  Bad news for me is that I live 3000 miles away...."}
{"text":"It is an average Italian restaurant. The view of Pittsburgh is nice but that is all this place is. Food and decor is not exciting, the service is not special. I was here with a large group and everybodys impression was the same 3 star food in a 3 star establishment. They have a full bar."}
