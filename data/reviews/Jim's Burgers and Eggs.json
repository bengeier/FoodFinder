{"text":"I go here about once every two week for lunch, and its always good food and good service...can't complain. Burger is good, fries are good.... Daily specials sometimes warrant not getting the $6.25 burger/fries/drink special..... Never had meal to complain about here..."}
{"text":"Let me get right to the point.   Good food - when they get it right.  Good service when you don't get the owner (lady) waiting on you. I'll say she seems annoyed to take your order and actually complained that it had been busy.  Yup...you gotta hate having a busy business. (sarcasm)  The wait staff have been very nice. It's just that you have to wait for ever for your food...only to get it and have to send it back because it's wrong, then wait forever to get it back and have the rude owner glare and confront you.   Been there about 5 times...the latest wasn't any better then the first.   Great potential..hope they can turn around.   My suggestion: Hire a restaurant manager - have the owners never get behind the counter and build a family atmosphere. Apologize when food is wrong, make sure that the staff are treated nicely. Oh and always make sure the tables are cleaned quickly."}
{"text":"have been employed in various forms of customer service for longer than I care to admit - so I try to have a \"from both sides of the counter\" perspective when it comes to negative reviews. I prefer to vote with my feet when a place is not worth the hassle, and have never left a negative review (that I can recall) although I always try to leave a positive one, especially when it is truly merited. My daughters and I went to Jim's during a weekday afternoon recently, in which the dining room was mostly empty and the line at the counter was non-existent. Never having been to Jim's before, and unsure of the set-up I was hesitant on what to do or how to do it - this was apparently my first mistake with the girl at the counter, who - much like a shark smelling blood in the water - snapped at me repeatedly while I fumbled with my order. I hate to pull out the \"I-have-never-been-treated-that-way\" card, but cripes.... the one-star reviews are not lying, folks. We had the basic burgers and fries - and they were so very good. The dining room was cool, roomy and clean. The wait staff was... well. They were there. I sensed both the girl who delivered our order (who we never saw again) and the boy who went by us at least once might have wanted to have a semblance of humanity - perhaps the wench behind the counter drains it out of them before they have a chance, I don't know. Good food, good location, good prices. Horrible service. Will never return."}
{"text":"I have tried this place 4 times now, since I live close. Service has always been poor, we never receive our food together.  Today I stopped in by myself to grab a quick burger, place was empty. Ordered a cheese burger, $ 4.72 I think, gave my card. Woman says can only use card for 5 dollars, would not budge...  No more business from my family and I."}
{"text":"Great food and better lunch special. 6.95 for huge burger, fries, and coke."}
{"text":"We have been what I would consider fairly regular customers.  Food is good but the older lady at the cashier has terrible people skills.  I'm tired of how she treats people.  They lost a good customer ... and she could probably care less."}
{"text":"Well the entire concept is strange..but here's what I got...Okay this is my first time at this place and the lady at the register needs a lesson in customer service.  What a crab ass!  I did not care for the way she spoke to my friend!  She's lucky I was hungry.  So we order sit and wait...and wait...20 mins and we ask can we at least get our drinks?  20 for minutes for steak and eggs and a steak and egg sandwich.  The food was decent but if you are wait for minutes for food then it should be full service not ordered like fast food.  That lady though, wow she was a miserable sob!"}
{"text":"Food was ok and very fast. Cheeseburger had cheese that was not melted. Same complaint about the woman at the register, rude and seemed bothered that we came into the place at all. If you want a quick meal, then fine. Not really restaurant quality though."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place at 11:19am. Phyllis the manager took my order over the phone. She was completely rude and didn't understand my order until I repeated it several times. She then tells me it's going to be 45 minutes because they're really busy. We went to pick up our order 45 minutes later and no one greeted us or at least said \"we'll be right with you\" so we waited another 5 minutes for someone to even acknowledge we were there. Then Phyllis tells us that our order isn't ready because \"they lost it\". I think she never even took down the order and then just blamed the cooks. I told her I wanted to speak with a manager and when she said she was the manager I told her I wanted to speak with the owner. She said he was in Greece and that she was the only one there. I asked for the meal to be free since she clearly didn't do her job right. She said no and when I told her she's not showing good customer service and that she's not a good manager she proceeded to thank me. I told her that it wasn't a compliment and that she shouldn't thank me. I paid for my meal and told her I would never order from them again and that I would be posting a review. I NEVER review anything so for me to take my time to write this out shows how bad this place really is. Their food isn't anything special either, just convenient. I've heard so many bad stories about this lady so I highly recommend you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food isnt bad. The customer  service sucks. Dinning in- food took forever. Take out- food was faster, charged me for extra ranch, crammed my food in the smallest bag they had. And the big lady at the register seems to be always rude whenever I go in and i feel like Im ordering from The Soup Nazi. Thats it Im done."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been regulars at Jim's for about 3 years. We enjoy the food when we are in the mood for a cheat meal....about 3 times a month. I have witnessed the lady at the cash register berate customers and employees quite often over the years. Well....today was my turn. She was extremely rude when I asked a question. This was out last visit to the establishment, I will not go back. I would much rather purchase from a nicer place of business.  The waitress waiting our table was very apologetic. I asked her, \"I suppose she is the owner's wife which allows her to lash out at people?\" She said yes, she is very rude to all.  I am a business owner who has the privilege to work with my wife day to day. I can tell you that we would never treat out patrons like this. Our business success is directly related to customer service. They seem to do a brisk business for now....but soon competition will move into the area and take customers away....so enjoy it for now as it will change unless you change the person that is engaging with your customers."}
{"text":"The wait to get your food was long even tho they were not all that busy. The inside is clean but the decor is nothing special. Just like the decor the food was nothing to rave over ether, it was like any other burger. All things said this is the one and only stop that I have made here so I may go again to try something other then they burgers to see if its better."}
{"text":"All there food is great. Would recc. to anyone. My wife and I go here a lot."}
{"text":"nothing special....but a decent dining experience.  agree with another reviwer that the owner's wife (or manager... not quite sure) wasn't very friendly.  portions are generous, but I ordered over-easy eggs which came out over-hard!  nice decor and our server was friendly."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this place again! My family and I decided to give it another shot (1st time here we received bad service as well) the owner (lady at the register) is soooo extremely rude!"}
{"text":"Really REALLY great burgers! I went here with some friends and I was surprised how amazing my meal was, I got the Hawaiian burger add bacon combo and I am very satisfied after eating i feel a nap coming my way. Also service is fast and friendly and the prices are affordable and comparable to most fast food places. Will definitely come back here soon!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but service sucks. I hate having to see employers yell at their employees for no reason."}
{"text":"IN A WORD, PHYLLIS. THIS WOMAN treats her hard working wait staff in a manner that makes eating here resounding uncomfortable for the customers. PHYLLIS openly, loudly, and frequently from across the restaurant insults and demeans her wait staff to the extent that a customer can't even enjoy a meal. I should of paid attention to the many many many previous reviews that indicated the same thing about PHYLLIS. The individuals that work there in every capacity all say the same thing about PHYLLIS and even her daughter tries to deflect the fact that Phyllis is her mother because she is ashamed of this woman's behavior towards her coworkers. It's one thing to correct and train an employee and it's quiet another to publicly humiliate and insult. Shame on you PHYLLIS."}
{"text":"In my opinion the food is kind of bland... burger meat didn't catch my taste buds but was kind of greasy. Giant buns with a smaller patty... and the service while ordering was very rude and seemed like I was wasting her time trying to get my order in... I won't return unless some major improvements take place"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Jims since it open.  It's the only burger place that makes a burger like back home in CA.  I have notice through the years how terrible the service was and how rude the staff is.  Never really cared they were never rude to me so I didn't care to much. I guess it was only a matter of time, I walked in with my kids to have breakfast. It was busy but not crazy busy, this place is a seat yourself. Usually I order and my kids go sit at a table.   Never have I experience what this women at the counter did to me she asked me to tell my kids to leave the table because other customers had to sit down. I guess that would be ok if it was assigned seating but it's not. I have been a customer there for years and she treated me like I was nobody.  This lady is the owner of this place with her husband. How they stay in business I don't know she is rude and they treat their staff like garbage, no wonder why They can't keep staff."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and after this time, I personally won't go back. The first time I went the food tasted great, well mostly. I got a BLT and onion rings. I specifically asked for it to be dry, no mayo or special sauce. When I got it home, it was loaded up. Ok no biggie it happens.   The second time I went I got the same thing, again asking for nothing other then bacon, lettuce and tomato. I also ordered onion rings. My husband picks it up and brings it home and there is sauce all over it again, as well as the onion rings are burnt.   This last time I figured I'd try something new. I got a burger and said ONLY mustard, lettuce and pickles. Again got the onion rings. Well much to my dismay there are tons of onions on the burger and the onion rings are in edible. Burnt and horrible.   The reason I gave it a 3 is because my husband likes it and even though his order was wrong 2/3 times he doesn't much care. I won't go back, but he may on his own. It's sad because the people seem friendly."}
{"text":"First visit and was sorely disappointed in the service.  Instead of feeling like I'm a customer and we appreciate you, I felt like they thought they were doing me a favor by feeding me.  Nothing but attitude when I wanted to ensure that the omelette I was ordering was not going to be browned as I saw eggs on the grill being cooked.  The omelette I ordered was supposed to have sausage in addition to other stuff.  Part way through the omelette, no sausage.  I wanted my eggs cooked done but not brown.  Most restaurants call that lite.  She, order taker, was calling it soft.  As a result, the inside of the omelette was funny.  Suffice to say that I will not be returning to that place again.  I can forgive the missing sausage, and the runny egg, but the attitude of the workers usually saves a bad food experience.  The attitudes I experienced couldn't save a great food experience."}
{"text":"The burgers were great! We are new to this area and were looking for good food places. We came here based on the reviews from YELP,  and it was the right choice. Will definitely make it a favorite. Came on a Thursday afternoon, abet it was perfect timing, hardly any customers. Clean, quick, delicious and well priced.  Love this place. Please leave a tip for the wait staff."}
{"text":"Lets just start by saying the food is 3 stars the overall experience is 2 stars if you care to know more read on..   Food was prepared as it should be nothing that stands out about the food, they do have large portions so you can count on that.  As for the service... Well what service it's terrible the big lady who work the register is always there and she is just miserable all the time period! She treats her employees like slaves and there was a shit load of FLYS  in the place so yea 3 stars at best but to me it was a 2 star place"}
{"text":"Fantastic food for a great price! Great place for couples and families! The people here are so friendly! Food is good for dinner and breakfast! Guaranteed we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Ok after reading a  few reviews I was warned of the counter angry lady. So I went in prepared. Whatever with her I gave her my order they gave me my food I was happy. Sure she can be a little on the get to the point, but the food was great. Its what I want from a mom and pop burger place. I have had burgers and chicken sandwiches and loved them both. I would go back regardless of the angry lady. Don't be afraid try it out and experience the angry lady before she has a heart attack and the places closes down."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place 1 star is because of the staff. I ask a question about the menu and she sead to me; do you know how to read? As my friend and I try to find the answer. We look up and she just disappeared like Chris Angle.  Watch out for that evil witch in the front! Soooooo overall this place is crap but they have nice burgers."}
{"text":"I have given this place three attempts since it opened. During my first visit, the apparent owner, was ripping her employees a new one for something in front of customers. It was completely unprofessional and disrespectful.   My last and final visit was this past week. It took 30 mins to grab food to go. Our fries were cold. The women that took the order, again likely the owner, was short and rude and they made an epic big deal when another customer asked for pickles. They argued about it for five minutes instead of just giving the customer pickles.  Below average food, over priced, awful customer service. It is a direct result of bad leadership."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. Be sure you get here early because the fruit and waffles goes quick. This place has a open seating area inside and out. Ordering is caferteria style,  so a bit odd. The older lady at the counter is crabby and hard of hearing. Coffee is always available and hot. The general seating area is loud with the cooks in the background. Yelling/talking. 4 stars."}
{"text":"The food at Jim's is is great but I have to write about the service. Not the waitresses, who are always wonderful, but the cashier. She's an older lady and is very rude to her staff. Not sure why since her staff are always on point and friendly. I've always had good and friendly service when she's not there, but when she is there especially on the weekend, she can be very rude to the girls who are doing a good job. Not a good way to impress your customers."}
{"text":"We had been here for burgers once before and thought we would try out their breakfast. We were very disappointed. We were greeted at the register by an older woman in glasses who we later found out was the owners wife. She was very rude while taking our order. Rolled her eyes when we asked about substituting certain items. When asked if they had flavored creamer she rudely replied no to find out after we ordered they actually did. Then we waited for over an hour for our food! The servers were nice so that's an upside and the food was ok. However we will be sticking to nicks diner from now on."}
{"text":"Great chili cheese burger. Messy and gets all over your hands and fingers! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been several times and their menu is extensive. I loved their basic lunch deal: burger, fries & a drink for around $6.   I will say this, though. Every time we go in a waitress is crying. I don't think the bosses are very kind to their workers. It's like a soap opera over there. It's entertaining, but also a little sad.   But the food is great, so if crying waitresses doesn't bother you, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This place has good food for what it is no doubt. The issue is with the staff particularly the lady that owns the place. She's extremely rude not only to the customers but also her employees."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today and I was blown away at how good the food was.  The place is very cool  and kinda like a old burger joint.   The place was packed and our food came out fast.  And like I said the burgers and fries were great.   Good price too.  I heard it's a family owned burger place which I love    I would def go back there.  I can't wait to try other things. I heard breakfast is great it's just getting up is the problem lol."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Jim's and I just want to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I got a pastrami Charbroiled burger for  $4.95, a large drink and a ton of crispy fries for $2.75 more.  I couldn't finish it all but put a large dent into the meal. The staff was friendly and professional, checked in with me to see if everything was as I requested and it was better.  Can't beat the price and the quality.  I will go back and tell my friends all about Jim's"}
{"text":"There are a variety of hamburgers to choose from.  I tried the bacon burger and the bbq burger.  Both have excellent flavor and were delicious.  Looking at the menu items, it is a bit pricey, but they do give fairly large portions and it is quality food.  My suggestion would be to still lower the price a bit and train the staff to be more enthusiastic in their dealings with customers.  Friendliness, especially if you get to know some of the names of repeat customers will go a long way in retention.  I hope this restaurant succeeds because I am tired of chain restaurants.  I have already returned to eat here and will try other food items on the menu."}
{"text":"First time here.  All I can say is bring your appetite.  I had an omelette.  There are 14 different choices of what kind you can get.  My husband had a cheeseburger.  Your choices of burgers are a lot also.The portions were really large and I could have easily shared my omelette.  My husband ,which is a big eater, couldn't get through his meal.  The staff were very friendly and they checked on how we were doing several times.  We will be back.  If you are looking for a fancy place to eat this isn't the place but if you want good food. Here is the place"}
{"text":"The food isnt anything spectacular. The attitude of the employees is more like your bothering them for coming in.  When you order they also put outgoing food on the counter your standing at to pay. Dont stand too close to that counter cause you will get shood away or told to back up. I understand about not wanting you to breath on people's food but maybe they should have thought the whole layout delivery system better.  Their servers seem like they hate being there. Not one smile. We actually had our food before we got our drinks and then she realized she forgot our drinks but then took another table their drinks, that were after us before she brought ours! The worst part is the greasy grill smoke that fills the place. It makes it very hard to breathe and not very nice to be in there."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Rude staff. Never again. The owners are the rudest business owners I've ever seen. How they are still in business baffles me. Save your money and go to Nicks diner or Cracker Barrell!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service !! Waited an hour for our mediocre food !! Waitresses were nice but , overwhelmed ! They need a better system . Owner should really look into figuring out a different system !!"}
{"text":"If I was rating just on breakfast, this would be 5 star, hands down. Their lunch/dinner items were just OK. Their omelets, however, are AWESOME and make this place one of my favorite breakfast spots in Surprise."}
{"text":"The owner who runs the register yells at her staff in front of customers. I found that very unprofessional. When burger was ready after 20 minutes, some guy in the back screamed something and waved his hands at me angrily like it was my fault i wasnt standing by front waiting. Burger was good though, its just the ownership sucks. I also hate how a burger combo comes out to 6.92 and they always want to charge me a fee because the minimum is 7.00...."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Horrible, appalling service!!! Stay away unless you enjoy being spoken to by the owners wife who takes the orders at the cash register with the most condescending and belligerent attitude. Numerous times I have tried this place and each and every time I am verbally assaulted when trying to order. Jim please remove your wife from the front counter or she will ruin your return business. If I could give this place no stars I would!"}
{"text":"Larger cashier lady was rude as $&@!. Every time I go and order, it's the same result. Last time I went, she asked what she could get for me, so I ordered three meals for my family. After ordering she asked me to repeat that. So she made me repeat the entire order over! I wasn't ordering fast and I wasn't mumbling...So frustrating! The food is good though if you can set aside the rude customer service. I would probably have given them 4 stars if it weren't for the cashier."}
{"text":"This is not a down to earth diner spot. Beware of the burger grouch at the register, her attitude is enough to scare any customer away - I hope she reads these reviews and maybe changes her attitude a bit. She's far from pleasant!"}
{"text":"The food is actually really good, the low rating is for the woman that is always at the counter. She is one of the rudest people I have ever met. We have gone on multiple occasions because the food is good and it's close to our house. Every occasion I leave shaking my head on how it seems she's doing is a favor by us eating there. I have read all the other reviews and see that I'm not alone, take a hint lady and stay behind the scenes. On a  better note the pastrami burger is really really good."}
{"text":"I go to Jim's for the comfort food, and it is always Fresh and plenty of it. Their fries are the best around. I always get their burgers, no one beats the char-broiled taste and theirs is the best. I never leave hungry. They also now have a kids Birthday club. www.iNeedYourAddress.com/jimsburgers-and-eggs"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, big portions. You walk up to the counter, order food and the waitress brings the food to your table. Love that they offers breakfast, burgers, sandwiches and salads. Mom and pop settings, love it."}
{"text":"We stopped at Jim's Burgers and Eggs for breakfast (on a Sunday) and can honestly say this just might be the worst breakfast experience ever.   The concept is simple (or so you'd think). You walk up to the counter and place your order with the girl that greets you. After you place your order and pay for your food they tell you to get your coffee yourself and they will bring everything else (other beverages included) to you and that you seat yourself. About 10 minutes later I had to ask for my orange juice as it had not come out yet.   I suppose I should have known when I sat down and noticed the looks of confusion on the faces of people that had already been sitting and looking in to the kitchen might signal something was up. The kitchen I might add is super small and was directly behind the girl at the counter that takes your order. The kitchen also only had 2 people (TWO PEOPLE) making food with about 15 tickets on the board waiting to be made. I'm assuming the owner/manager was the one making the toast and putting the plates up for the 2 food runners to take.   We had waited about 30 minutes (I was being generous considering you could clearly see they were running behind) before I finally asked how much longer before our food was there. The food runner asked what we had ordered and went to check. She came back and said we're next. About 10 minutes later and after I witnessed 2 other tables that came after us get their food, we finally get part of our order. Yes part. It seems not one table got all of their food at the same time. One table actually had some of their food delivered well after others were done eating. Anyway, my boyfriend got his food and mine came out shortly after. We both ordered omelets. Folks, it does not take 40 minutes to make an omelet. About 5 minutes after that I had to ask for my toast that is supposed to come with the meal.   Now, I try really hard to give restaurants and their staff the benefit of the doubt (my boyfriend is a restaurant manager so I understand the delays that are expected) but this was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Not a single person apologized for the wait or even volunteered an update on our order. The look of frustration was clearly visible on the faces of every person that worked there.   I now know why you pay for your food first, we would have walked out had we not. The only reason and I mean only reason I am giving 2 stars is because our omelets were good. I won't even go into the hash browns but I will say this, I do believe they're supposed to be cooked and not just crispy on top before they serve them to you.   My recommendation is this, avoid this place at all cost if it's a Sunday morning. Heck, avoid it if there are more than 2 tickets in the window of orders to be made. This establishment clearly can't handle a rush of business."}
{"text":"My first impression when I walked in the door was all the litter on the floor. It was busy but they could have swept.  I ordered sunny side up eggs. They were awful. They were so well done that they were more like soft-boiled. They do give you three eggs but they were very small. The hash browns and bacon were good. I expected a place that has eggs in its name would know how to make sunny side eggs. It wasn't a very friendly place. The workers all seemed unhappy to be there. Everything considered, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wish I could have rated this with 0 stars. Worst customer service ever!  No drinks after 45 minutes.  No apologies and we finally left."}
{"text":"the service here is absolutely atrocious!  The big lady with the short hair whom i believe is the manager? needs a reality check! If you would like customers to return try treating them with respect instead of giving them nothing but attitude. I don't plan on returning here ever again! In fact after the first time coming i said the same thing but i figured maybe she was just having a bad day and I would give it another try. This is now the second time and she was the exact same. She does nothing but talk down to customers and belittle them. Im not an idiot and i don't expect to come for lunch and be treated like one. Every thing she said was a rude snotty remark. The waitress we had was lovely and its a shame that the manager was so rude to spoil our whole experience. I actually wanted to get up and leave before our food arrived. The food is average nothing special and because of our awful service it certainly wont be a miss. So jim all im telling you is make sure you put someone else on a register so that lady doesn't have to interact with customers because she gives possibly the worst customer service i have ever experienced!"}
{"text":"We gave this place three attempts. The first time was in the evening when my husband and I were alone. It was during the week and the food was just fine.It came quickly and was affordable. So we decided to bring the entire family on the weekend.   The wait was over 30 minutes for simple breakfast food. Of our six orders, all but two came out wrong. My order was botched to the degree that I told them to take it back and remove it from the bill. I grabbed a sandwich at nearby Subway instead.  So a long time passes and we were again in the neighborhood last Sunday. It is hard to get a table for six in a restaurant on Sunday because of the return of the snowbirds. All of our usual haunts had lines. So we tried this place again.  The older woman taking the orders is not particularly friendly or welcoming. She hand wrote the ticket which I thought was odd and inefficient. Then she added it on an archaic cash register that did not detail the order. It was simply a list of charges.Very frustrating when you have six meals and drinks and you want to ensure that everything was included.  We sat down and waited. And waited. The place was half full and many people had no food in front of them. We saw people expressing impatience by calling the wait staff over and walking up to the register presumably to check on the order. After 30 minutes we had had enough and were prepared to leave. I asked if my order was being processed and the woman looked at the line of orders above the stove. She said that it was being filled now. I returned to the table. It still took a full ten minutes to deliver a bunless burger, a cheese omelet, a steak sandwich, a grilled cheese and two other sandwiches. And of those orders, the omelet, a sandwich, and a steak sandwich were botched. My bun less burger was a smear of ground beef next to a slice of unripe tomato, lettuce and a pickle. It was well seasoned, but not a meal. And you cannot tell me that a bun would have made it more substantial.  We were visible upset and, like the last time, no one cared. The wait staff was not perceptive. Our waitress in particular looked near tears because so many people were upset. Since they make you pay for the meal when you order, there is no walking out without penalty.  I will never return. I think I gave it enough opportunity and it failed."}
{"text":"One word....Horrible! For all the same reasons all these other people hated it. Ticked off too cause I had high hopes for it. Gordan Ramsey please save this place!"}
{"text":"On the upside, Jim's is a nice local diner for those of us here in west side of Surprise.  The food was above average.  Well-seasoned and fresh.  The kids and I ordered burgers and fries, while my wife had a gyro.  The food arrived hot after a short wait.  On the downside, the servings were on the small size.  Scant toppings, small burger patty and the gyro was about 1/2 the size of the one depicted on the menu.  Fries were extra, so what was a $4.50 burger ended up being closer to $7.00 with the drink combo.  In the end, it's a nice place but it's far too pricey for what you get.  I may go back infrequently, but I'd rather spend the extra gas money and drive down to Red Robin for a better burger and limitless fries!"}
{"text":"I agree with Josh.  Burgers have gone down hill since I first came a year or so ago.  They have shrunk and are as dry as a bone.  They skimp on the dressing too but if you ask for extra they want 50 cents now.  The fries were generous and tasty but that's about all you can expect anymore.  Service and attitudes need to get better if that's even possible.  And like others have said condiments are disgustingly dirty."}
{"text":"Just ordered to go from this place and they did not disappoint.  The burgers are huge and very good, the fry's are also very yummy!!!!  Definitely will make a place in our dining out rotation."}
{"text":"I have been going to Jim's for several weeks primarily for breakfast.  Overall, I think the food is good.  My problem is I have \"never\" had a piece of toast that is hot or buttered properly.  There is generally a small dab of butter in the middle of the cold toast.  I don't know about you, but I like hot - or at least warm - toast.  And if it is suppose to be buttered, butter it.  This is a minor complaint, but it annoys me.  My bigger issue is the owner's wife.  She is rude and nasty.  I am in her establishment buying food to support their restaurant and I think it would be nice if she could be a little more kind and friendly to her customers.  It isn't only me that she is rude to, it is almost every customer.  I am at the point of not going back to Jim's or referring them to friends because of her attitude towards the customers."}
{"text":"We have been here twice.  The first time the food was okay, the second time it was pretty bad.    The service both times was pretty horrible.  The last time it took us 50 minutes to get our food (and over 30 minutes to even get drinks after asking 4 times) on a Saturday morning at 11:00 a.m. when they should have had plenty of staff on hand.  Also - the religious quote on the cash register is pretty silly.  I don't care if the owners are Christian, please keep it to yourself and respect that others (your customers) may have different spiritual perspectives and may not find it welcoming.  I agree with the others that the woman at the counter is not nice."}
{"text":"This was my second day of work in the surprise area and a friend of mine who is a local said the best burger in town was at Jim's. After checking several reviews I reluctantly decided to go.   The restaurant is larger than what I imagined it would be, but it was nice. Ordering style is similar to five guys so I was at least familiar with the process.   I ordered the double cheeseburger with fries and a drink. The food was good but not incredible. I tasted my friends onion rings and felt the same about those.   Good food and plenty, but there is no way I can give Jim's a 4 star review because New York flavor got that and the food is simply better there.   Knowing this i would likely end up going there for a burger.   Maybe the other items on the menu are great and I only captured a small window of what was available and unfortunately there was another competitor for that item in the area. I will go back and try something else on the menu to see if my mind can be changed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here from road tripping from the Grand Canyon and we decided to stop for some food. This place looked popular so we decided to go here. All the burgers and choices looked great, so when we got to the front, I asked the lady which burger was the most popular. The lady then looked at me like I was stupid and said, 'are you serious?' I said, 'yea were from Oregon'. She then rudely without making eye contact handed me a menu and then said, 'NEXT!' My boyfriend and I placed the menu down and left. Never will I come back here again, the service is horrible and you can tell that it's a core issue by the way their employees treat each other and their customers. Worst service ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Jim's is your average greasy spoon. It's not going to win any awards or rock the boat, however the food they serve is solid and should be considered if you're in surprise and desiring a non-chain burger and fries meal."}
{"text":"I have been to Jim's Burgers & Eggs about 4 or 5 times. I have never had a problem with the staff or the time it takes to get served food. The food has never been mind blowing, but just ok and they are at a convenient location. I went in on a Sunday morning at 10am to pick food up for my family. It was very busy and there was not a table available in sight. I kept this in mind as I placed my order. I ordered and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. At the 45 minute mark I asked a server how my order was coming. She came back a few minutes later and said they are working on it now. Another 15 minutes went by and lunch started coming out of the kitchen and being served. Many of the people who had ordered after me received their food. I went to the counter and asked for a refund. The woman at the counter said I was still third in line. There was no problem getting my money back but there was also not an apology. I can wait 30 - 40 minutes for food on a busy day but an hour is just too long without being told prior to ordering. I would have went somewhere else if I would have know it would be an hour to an hour and a half for my order. If you go to Jim's on a Sunday morning you may want to bring a novel to read. I really want this place to succeed but their food needs to get better and they need to learn to expedite orders more timely."}
{"text":"I have never been here before or even heard of the place so I decided to try it and loved it! They have a great selection of burgers and breakfast for a very reasonable price. And they have combo specials as well! Burgers seemed about an average around $6 and the breakfast looked delicious but I decided on the turkey sandwich. The fries were deliciously seasoned! Drinks and food is all ordered at the counter and they bring everything to you! Everyone working was very kind and very helpful! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"my husband and I went since  all our friends kept saying food is delicious so we tried it food was amazing. The lady that's took are order was okay but not too friendly but food came out fast and definitely fulfilled our expectations."}
{"text":"Most unfriendly place in the west valley. Lots of greasy food and breaded meats. I am done."}
{"text":"I loved my egg burger.. I wish I lived on this side of the town so I can come everyday. Very good food!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great; however, the older lady that takes orders in the front is not too friendly or helpful. Overall that would be the only thing keeping me from going back there."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is improving.  Wish it was more of a waitress style service and they had a bigger kitchen because when they are busy, you feel it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  If I could give a 0 I would. The service SUCKS! Don't even attempt to call in an order because when you get there your order will be all messed up.  Then when you bring it to the attention they get to blaming each other from the cook to the order taker but no one taking responsibility. They won't try to make the customer happy by compensating for their mistake. Don't waste you time, spend your hard earned money in an establishment that values customer service."}
{"text":"I like Jim's and Jim is a cool dude.  I love their breakfast, especially that French Toast deluxe. Pancakes are huge. Ortega burger is yummy.  My stomach ran out of room when I ordered the pastrami. Staff is friendly and food is cooked well.  This is a family owned restaurant, not Denny's or some other chain so it will come with its own personality. My personal bias is that I would rather support a mom&pop business over a chain any day."}
{"text":"FOOD was very bland and lacked flavor!  The service was ok and nothing special.  The burgers and breakfasts we ordered were cooked quick and lacked flavor!  The shrimp was undercooked and very disappointing!  The only good thing was the chili fries which were very simple and a 5 year old could make!"}
{"text":"If it were possible to give this \"restaurant\" a lower rating, I would, but a one star review is the best I could do.  To start off, the atmosphere of the restaurant is much like the DMV, as noted by another reviewer. I did not feel very welcomed to be in the building.  My boyfriend and I both walked in to order food for a family of 5, so it was a \"larger\" order than what's typical. We waited in line of about 2-3 people in front of us, which was no big deal. When we finally reached the register, the grumpy old woman said, \"What can I get for you?\" to which my boyfriend responded the first order we had written down. The thing that really ticked me off was that after my boyfriend had mentioned the order, the old lady looked back at him and asked him to repeat it, as she was on her phone, which seemed to be more important than the customer. Throughout our interaction with the grumpy old woman, I felt very irritated and unwelcomed to the restaurant, because her service was worse than garbage.  My boyfriend and I paid for the order, which was way overpriced, in my opinion, and stood to the side to wait, as it was a take-out order. About 15-20 minutes passed, our food was finally ready. We had ordered a few burgers (which weren't all that great) that came with fries. When our food was packaged in the box, we were ready to leave, however, a man coming from the back decided to lean in, grab the box by our fries (without gloves), and ask us if we needed ketchup. At that point, I didn't even want to take home the fries, as it did not seem his hands were, at all, clean.  The whole restaurant seemed untidy and dirty.  I don't intend on returning to the restaurant solely because of the terrible service."}
{"text":"The food was good but your customer service is as bland as oatmeal... well the cashier i got was very rude and it was my first time eating there and when i was wondering if the burgers came with frys or something she gave me a stern look and said \" i dont know hunny hurry up \""}
{"text":"Not sure where to start. Service was by far the worst I've ever experienced. They claim to serve breakfast and lunch all day, but when we ordered the kids chicken fingers the lady taking our order roller her eyes and said we were going to screw up the cooks. Now, I don't claim to be a chef, but how hard can it be to dump fries and chicken into a deep fryer? The food took an hour and a half, and the drinks followed 15 min later. I understand places can get busy, but over an hour for eggs and chicken??? The food quality was that of Denny's.   Save your time and find somewhere else to dine."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but I will never eat here again. The customer service is horrible. The lady with the short hair is so unbelievably disrespectful. I could not believe it, never has anyone been so rude before. Idc if she is the owner you treat customers with respect no matter what. I will not recommend this place to anyone due to her attitude. She is the first person people see, first impressions are everything and she is definitely giving a bad impression!"}
{"text":"My rule is to always give a small, local business 3 tries before I write them off due to a bad experience. Well, today was strike 3!  It is unfortunate, because the food is actually good. The service, and overall atmosphere is really really bad though. I could go example, by example of issues I have had, but instead I will just say that it does not appear that anyone who works the morning shift, even remotely wants to be there.  School cafeteria workers seem to enjoy serving food more than these 2 ladies. To be fair, I have not tried the afternoon or evening shifts, but after these 3 attempts, I am done with this place."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.    Service doesn't come with a smile if it comes at all.  Food is ok but not worth the negative atmosphere shining off the staff."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to give the owners a\"heads up\" about  Poor service Poorly organized staff Over cooked food I was going to write a more detailed critique, but after reading most of these reviews all Ican say is DITTO. Had I read them ahead of time, I would have saved myself a trip to Jim's.  BTW.. If you sit outside you get to interact with all the flies that hang around the dirty tables... I forgot to mention that I had  a hamburger patty and eggs for breakfast. The patty was about as 3/8 of an inch and so tough I had to cut it with a knife and fork. The eggs were so well done the yolks were like hard boiled eggs. I asked for over medium. Needless to say I barley touched it."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boys are burger fans claiming Jim's top of their list. My in laws want to eat at Jim's every time they visit from Ohio. All is made to perfection and fresh to order.  We are a family of 6 all in agreement Jim's is our favorite breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  They are consistently busy, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to update my previous review. My family used to order ahead quite often. The last 2 times we've ordered, the burgers were not very good at all. Small thin patties that seemed dry. The chili burger had no taste at all and I didn't even finish it. So not impressed. This last time I had the barbeque burger. Small thin dry patty. The onion ring was more impressive than the burger. Barely any sauce. The fries are still AMAZING and you get tons of them. However this past time the fried mushrooms were more like dry crunchy hunks of.....well...i don't know but they weren't noticeably mushrooms. Were fried too long and whatever they were fried in left an odd aftertaste, like old oil frying that's had its time awhile ago. Sorry, will be taking a break from Jim's for awhile. Hopefully they get back to basics again and bring their quality back."}
{"text":"Good burgers but the staff needs a hug! Really considering jumping the counter and just hugging them all. I feel bad for the little kid cleaning the tables. Kid is scared to make any eye contact. Now... I am thinking about what kind of tip I should leave. The rudeness level was high, but not as high as usual. They have earned the 10%! Normally I feel they should be paying me to eat here. Decisions...Decisions... If you want a good burger, come on down. If you want a good burger and expect a smile, keep on walking.   Update!!! My  sweet 5 year old baby just got a piece of jalapeño for free in her burger."}
{"text":"The owner and his wife are extremely RUDE! !. Went this morning and since they were busy she(the owners wife) wanted to charge me extra for rye toast instead of white.. she rudely told us that's how it works here. If you send something back you wait and additional 30 mins to get your order. If Jim and his wife weren't there if might be worth going."}
{"text":"Food is ok.... Rude service and the lady taking orders incredibly rude! Won't be back"}
{"text":"The servers are awesome and the cooks stay busy yet the time it takes to get food on the weekend is ridiculous. Either hire more staff or figure out a way to make things faster.  I am sitting here waiting for 45 minutes for an omelette and burger, unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times and I have enjoyed the food, but the attitude of the woman that acts as cashier and the older man that it was one cooks leave a lot to be desired. 1. Just today I ordered chicken fried steak and my daughter ordered pancakes , but the server did not bring us any silverware. I was able to get a server's attention after about a minute and ask her for silverware and she brings us a fork and napkins and throws it down on the table. I tried to get her attention to bring us a knife. I decide to walk up to the counter and see if I can find some myself. I see the silverware tray, but it has a sign on that says \"customers do not take the silverware your server will bring it to you.\" I decide that I am hunger and my food is getting cold, so I grab two knives. Then the older gentleman sees me take it and he tells me my server will bring, but I told him that I have trying to get her to bring it and I am hungry. He told \"can't you read the sing\", I told him that I did read it but I wanted to eat my lunch and I needed a knife to cut my steak.  I have never seen a owner that was so rude to a customer, I thought I was on a Sienfield episode with the 'soap Nazi\".  2. I was more than half way finished with my food before I got my Pepsi.   I will let you make the choose, the food is really and the price is fair but the staff can be rude at times. You will enjoy the food, if you can tolerate the slow service."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying the food isn't worth the price.... And the service is awful that old lady at the front counter need her ass beat!!! she is the rudest lady I have EVER talked too"}
{"text":"The owner who is also at the front of the house is beyond rude!! She told me that the customers she hadn't yet served was more important than the one question I had. She then had a serious attitude problem when I did go to order. I speak perfect English and she treated me as if I was talking a foreign language! Then when I asked to speak to the manager her comment was just don't bother coming back!!! Infront of a line of customers!!! After I discovered from the waitress she was the owner it was clear that the young girl serving us was terrified of her and made it clear that she treated then poorly. I have never felt more sorry for waitress staff anywhere. Worst front of house service. Not to mention slow wait for food"}
{"text":"I was in the area and I came across this restaurant and decided to try something new. On the window in front of the store there was an advertisement showing a meal deal which caught my attention. I went inside and I liked how the restaurant looked, and I took a photo of the advertisement outside since they didn't have the advert inside the store. As we went up to the front counter to order, I was holding my phone to read aloud the advertisement of the meal deal that I saw outside, which I was going to order. As I was reading it to this old lady who was the cashier,(she was wearing eye glasses, short hair, and spoke with a European accent) she said \"Are you talking to me or to the phone?\" And CLEARLY I was not talking on the phone. I said I'm reading off the picture of the ad that I took from outside, and she raised her voice at me, saying \" I know that ad, I'm the one who put it out there.\" I said that I'm new and that I didn't know. She made me feel incredibly dumb and worthless. I come from a strict family and not even my own father, who once came from a communist country, would have an attitude like this towards me. From a 50 year old \"customer service\" representative, I expected more from her. Also, a drink was included in that meal, and I was under the assumption that we put our own drinks so I don't need to tell her which drink I want, because remember, I am new to this restaurant. She questioned me again in an unprofessional manner, \" Well tell me the drink you want 'cause I can't read your mind.\" I said \"Okay I'm sorry, I'm new here. What drinks do you guys have?\" She flipped over a menu and pointed on the wrong side of the menu, and said \"drinks are right here,\" in a degrading tone. The food came out fast, but it was nothing new. My sister and I noticed that she was being nice and favored the senior citizens. She  was playfully joking with them, but was so rude with us. I must say that I have never felt so degraded in my life. That lady's service alone knocked down 4 stars off this review. For God sakes, give this woman proper customer service training!!! It's safe to say I will never step foot in this restaurant again. I can take my money elsewhere, where I feel safe and can enjoy my stay."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service from the person at the register & waitress was horrible! Will not be back because of them and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We're from California, sooooo happy when Jim's Burgers came to Surprise. Love the food, help is fine and I love the owners. No nonsense food, great taste and good prices. My only regret is I love it so much, eating there might become a serious habit. Try it you'll definitely like it.m"}
{"text":"The worst customer service they treat people like shit I was there today went to was sitting on the table waiting to his food be ready but he had impediment they couldn't be standing up and ask him to please get out of the table because they were full and they need a table for another customer."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but it took over 45 minutes to get it after placing my order. That is the only reason it loses two stars. A few minutes, fine. Half an hour, OK, maybe one star. But over 45 minutes?"}
{"text":"Looking for not so healthy good food?  This is the place, but customer service is not great.  You do not feel welcome.  I've been here a few times and each time I feel like I am bothering them with my order.  I would come back more often if the service was at least good but nope."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service sucks and the employees are rude. Not going back here again."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good burgers not gonna lie. But everything about this burger is just not up there. The meat is not always well done,tomatoes taste like they're old, bread is plain, lettuce is broad, and the bacon is over cooked. Every time I walk in the workers there are not friendly (but not rude either) they just act like they want to serve you and leave, but not like they wanna get to know you or start a conversation like other workers at different places.  highly recommend the Chili Cheese Fries though"}
{"text":"Food is very good. But the whole ordering system is terrible.  They should move to full service and forget the whole ordering in line. Waiting 20 minutes to order and then another 15 to 25 minutes to receive food is crazy."}
{"text":"Great local business and never disappointed with our food.  Word to the wise Sundays are slammed.  Generous drinks and tons of yummy fries."}
{"text":"Great service and good food been going there for years . Portions are huge can't beat the price . It's not fast food it's not high end its in between ."}
{"text":"Great food, Good prices. This place is a winner in this town.."}
{"text":"Why are there so many good reviews of this place?   Jim's Burgers and Eggs is just around the corner from where my parents live and my dad had been curious about this place for a while. We decided to try this place for something different for lunch and came in around 11 o'clock. It looked promising because there were quite a lot of people there, but we soon found out that it was lacking in a lot of areas.  First off, as we were ordering, the woman at the counter (the owner?) was arguing with her staff over an order. She was berating the poor girl and other staff members - mentioning quite loudly about how another waitress almost dropped a dish. It was unprofessional and delayed the time it took for our order to get to the cooks and furthermore delayed other patrons from ordering. But that was just the beginning.  My father and I sat down and I noticed that the tables weren't really clean. There were dishes from patrons who had left (and kindly left tips with their meals) that sat there until we left. There were a lot of people who seemed to be waiting on their orders as opposed to a lot of people enjoying the food.  We saw multiple patrons receive drinks before us although they had ordered after us. Why the staff at the front doesn't just serve the drinks right after ordering, I don't know; that's how most restaurants set up this way (order at the front, get a number) handle it. We saw the young waitresses make several trips doling out orders to a single table - I'm not sure why they don't make use of serving trays and silverware in their aprons, but it would improve the service by leaps and bounds. So would getting a decent POS system since it was apparent that their hand-written tickets were slowing down service.  The wait service was so awful that I started to feel bad for those girls. It's like somebody didn't teach them how to effectively wait tables. Between that and being berated by the owner, I'm not sure how any of those girls could handle sticking around.  Oh, and the food? What we ordered - the $6.25 burger special and a Hawaiian burger - wasn't very good. It's supposed to be a burger joint, yet the patties seemed to be of the lowest grade with lettuce that wasn't very fresh and buns that were substandard. The price is no excuse for the bad quality; In-N-Out uses much better buns and patties and the cost is dramatically lower, although I understand that this isn't a franchise or chain.   The whole time I couldn't help but think that this place could really use a visit from one of those restaurant consultants on television to teach them 1) how not to deal with employee issues in front of customers, 2) teach their staff how to wait tables, and 3) pick up the quality of food a bit. I can't really say I'm all that motivated to go back, though I'm curious about their breakfast items and might be tempted to try them sometime."}
{"text":"Sunday morning a fancy of four, we order at 11 30am and waited an 1-1/2 hours to received our food. When I ask the Manger why our lunch it took so long to serve it to us, she just walked away. No apologie and no explanation as to why. Our food wasn't worth our time and bill of $35. JIM'S Burger shame on you."}
{"text":"Love this place anytime of day! It's my neighborhood eat and the food is delicious. The price is right on the money and the staff is excellent."}
{"text":"Jim's has the best burger around. Huge portion size and tasty tasty burger. Priced right and good service"}
{"text":"i enjoy the food here at Jim's Burgers and Eggs. breakfast or lunch i am satisfied with what i get, especially the giant drinks they serve it with. Sometimes it can get busy with long lines and waits.   The one thing that i notice is the way the staff communicates with their customers- it may come off rude to some. the customer service doesn't lack throughout the staff but it lacks where it matters (cashier)."}
{"text":"Well, walked in for some country fried steak, left disappointed.   The cashier was not friendly and not helpful. She did not let us know the companies policies concerning substitutions and charged us for what we wanted to substitute. We would not have substituted if we knew that.   Then she charged us for things we did not order.   The food was okay. But can be found elsewhere and just as good if not better.   When we went up to ask about the charges and try to correct them the cashier was not helpful and argumentative. She looked at us like we were stupid and barely helped. Then instead of caring about customers,when we said we were not coming back, she looked at us and said \"well you've made your decision\". It's like they don't care about having return customers.   Stay away from this place as they do not care and food that is just as good can be found elsewhere"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Service is average-but 5 stars because food is worth it! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ugh... where do I start? Well, first off, we tried this place soon after its grand opening. We wanted to like this place because it's nearby the house but to our amazement we weren't too impressed. We think it's a bit overpriced and the food was mediocre. For instance the burger I ordered came with tons of lettuce, an oversized bun and a small patty hidden somewhere within. Again, this was after its grand opening. We vowed to not go back until they got everything squared away. We figured we would give them a second chance. A few months later we figured we'd give them their second chance. On Mother's Day morning after a quick run to Fry's we decided to stop in to Jim's for a quick to-go order of breakfast. We were able to walk right in and order though they seemed fairly busy. Our ordering experience wasn't the best: The older lady took our order without a smile and we felt she was impersonal. We received our number and sat down. Well let me tell you, we waited approximately 15 minutes before one of the waitresses acknowledged us and asked if we were waiting for a to-go order. She checked on the order and informed us that it would be a few more minutes (we were convinced that they never started our order). We waited another 8 minutes before we walked up to the counter and asked the impersonal non-smiling older lady what the status was. She pointed to our ticket (that was above the cook's heads) and said \"it's almost ready\". By that time we were getting pretty pissed. As we continued to wait we finally saw our order except there was one problem! They put one of the orders on a plate!! It was supposed to be TO-GO!!! They finally got the orders bagged up and in our hands. THAT WHOLE EXPERIENCE TOOK A WHOPPING 23-25 MINUTES!!! What place does that????? In conclusion, we brought the food home and again we weren't too impressed. The biscuits & gravy was mostly biscuit (not enough gravy) and the hot cakes were a little over cooked. My order, two over easy eggs, hash browns and toast wasn't bad at all.   We have decided to not ever go back to that place again. We'll go to Nick's Diner instead.     HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the service is terrible! I had a miscommunication with the waitress and instead of fixing the order and giving me what I wanted, she suggested I bring my food back that I had already taken home so they can add the toppings to the meal. More often then not you will find the staff upset to be at work. The food is ok, which is the only reason I gave them a 2 instead of a 1."}
{"text":"Good greasy food. There is a woman who seems unfriendly but always seems to be nice when I come in. I order Togo often and they are great about providing everything needed."}
{"text":"Average. Portions are large, the food was average. My biggest problem is like many other people have already mentioned is with the owner being disrespectful to staff. It pains me to see someone get yelled at. I've never understood why anyone would continue to go in day after day and take the abuse. Please go next door and work at subway or any other place that will treat you better."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. My favorite is their breakfast but they have wonderful burgers too...yum....only down side to this place is their service. Their service at the front desk and waitress aren't that great. But then again this isn't a place where you would expect great service. Great food....hells yes"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. After seeing some negative comments on this place and a few raving about it, I had to check it out for myself. People complained of a person Phyllis at the front counter being rude, yup... We were greeted with how many?  No, welcome how many in your party.  We were seated and waited and waited and waited. 20 minutes later a waitress came over after tagging her down, ordered drinks.  They came 10 minutes later, pretty dumped half of the cups on the table and we waited another 25 minutes, during in which I fed my infant. We waited 5 more minutes and left cash on table for the two sodas and walked out.  The lady at the front clueless said \"thanks, come back soon.  When my oldest keep saying \"I'm hungry\" & irritated people around us.  I said if we had a waitress then He would not be hungry!  When hell freezes over we will be back.  Don't waste your time!  Plated food that I did see was not appealing either. We went over to Sam's club and picked up a pizza!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place I've ever eaten at. And the lady who took our order was rude too. Never will return."}
{"text":"Yeah...I have to agree...food is ok...but having to put up with that miserable big Lady at the register just makes me never want to go back...I think she's in charge cuz her staff looks like they hate being there, and yes....a lot of flies inside."}
{"text":"Best pastrami burger ever. Good soda. Fries are sometimes over fried. I'm a happy returning customer. I drive from Goodyear to surprise to eat at jims."}
{"text":"Worst service and wait time. 45 minutes I waited for a to-go order. Would have been nice if they told me that! Never again! Don't come here hungry! And they made it wrong so I had to drive back to have them make a new one with no bacon like I ordered! Awesome waste of time!"}
{"text":"Food is good ... Service is bad. The saddest part is that the issue seems to be the owner/cashier."}
{"text":"Food is good but they should have a separate place for pick up orders to go. When i made a pick up order the woman on the phone couldnt tell me the total or when my order would be ready, so i arrived about 15 minutes after calling in and the line is all the way to the door! I had to wait in line for like another 15 minuets behind everyone who was waiting to order. I get home (i live about 3 minutes away) and my burger is cold! I called in to speak to a manager and i was told she wasnt there. Bs. their workers are ALWAYS rude, for the years ive been coming here. Its disappointing the poor customer service people receive because it really is a nice little spot but it makes you not want to give them your service"}
{"text":"My daughter and her family just relocated to an area near this establishment so we decided to try it out for dinner on a Saturday evening. They were not particularly busy when we arrived around 7pm. We took a while to order, as the menu is vast, but contrary to several of the reviews I read, we were not rushed or treated rudely at all. The girl at the register was very accommodating. We ordered the zucchini and some chili cheese fries for the table. In addition, we ordered 3 burgers and a toasted hot pastrami sandwich for three adults and three boys - myself and my two daughters with three of my grandsons in tow. It was more food than we could eat. By all reports, the burgers were good. The zucchini and chili cheese fries were also good. The pastrami, however, was rather nasty. First, it was not well toasted. It looked like the cook set it on the grill for, at most, a few seconds. Second, when I picked up one of the wrapped halves I noticed what appeared to be bits of ground or sliced vein. Upon further inspection, the meat was extremely fatty. I proceeded to removed the pieces that appeared inedible, which was quite a bit. I tried a bite, but it was just not good. Overall, the service was good and the food okay, but skip the pastrami."}
{"text":"This place has great quick food and I normally love supporting local businesses. However, I have been coming here since I moved to Surprise 2.5 years ago and the woman who works the register has never had a kind word to say. I don't need to be yelled at for asking what kind of bread they have available for their sandwiches. Then I was told they have \"All the bread. What do you want?!\"  If you don't mind the lady at the register being rude, then definitely come for the food. But if you expect a kind, friendly owner this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"This place was an unexpected surprise. Stopped in there just to see what was on the menu and ended up having a great breakfast. So much so I went back the next day!"}
{"text":"I, like others, wish there was a zero star, or even a half-star rating. Have taken my family to Jim's twice now-- once when the first opened and then again several months later. The both experiences were horrible from beginning to end with nothing changing as far as quality, service and friendliness of the staff. The cashier, whoever she is should be fired, or at least not allowed to speak to customers.   She was rude and acted as if she were doing everyone a favor by letting them eat at this establishment-- BOTH TIMES!! Slow and poor service the first time around may be excusable in light of opening-night glitches-- the second time? Not forgivable.   Our second visit was equally as bad as our first visit. It doesn't appear that Jim or his staff are too concerned about the cleanliness of the restaurant since everything looks to have a greasy blue film on it-- look at the large mirrors on the walls or the windows and you'll see what I mean. The wait was long on both visits-- 90 minutes from the time we entered the place to the time we left. I had a burger with an egg-- both of which were overcooked; the burger was burnt and tasteless. The ketchup container on the table was disgustingly filthy-- it was as if it had not been replaced or cleaned ever. So we asked for a different bottle to which we were told that they don't get new ones but that the waitress would clean this particular container off-- she never came back to the table. We asked for refills that were never brought to us. I asked for water-- which I never received.   Overall Jim's seems destined to be one of those dives that goes from bad to really bad then ultimately closes; all the while the owner, presumably Jim, doesn't understand what went wrong with his fledgling business.   Some businesses should never open to begin with."}
{"text":"I have now had their burgers AND their eggs. Neither are impressive. Combine that with over an hour wait for a breakfast burrito and french toast and you have lost this customer."}
{"text":"We met our friends there today for Breakfast, first we had to wait like 15 minutes for someone to clean the table, the order had to be placed at the counter, my wife wanted the French toast with Fruit, they claimed they had no Fruit. After we waited 55 minutes for our food, these people are clowns and over their heads, the place has flies all over. If we hadn't prepaid we would have left. We live nearby but will never go back, look up the place on Reems  & Greenway, much better. Complete waste of money and time, we ordered simple dishes and got very basic servings and the Bacon was old and overcooked, just disintegrated, nothing positive to say, our Server was in her second day and wasn't slowed to go to the back to look into the order.   ,"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times when visiting family in the area.  I have not had a negative experience yet.  I have enjoyed everything ordered, even though the chorizo sets my entire gi tract on fire, as a real, good chorizo should.  I have not remembered that on return trips. I have continued to order it.  I have not forgotten to kick myself later for my poor memory.  I have shared with my husband and particularly enjoyed anything smothered in gravy.  I have not regretted giving him half of my chorizo breakfast item in return for half of his gravy smothered breakfast item, (it has an amazing creamy cooling effect for which I am most grateful, as is part of the point I'm sure).  I am disappointed that people have had bad experiences here. I am not willing to believe that they are worth only 2.5 stars.  I would give them four stars if it wasn't for my poor tolerance of which I am sure is a truly great amount of spice, because then I would be in love, as most chorizos I have had are much too mild. I wouldn't give up on this place folks...if u like em give em a good review and bring up those star ratings...I don't typically eat at places less than three stars - not to sound like a foodie or something."}
{"text":"Food is fine, service not so much. They served us our burgers, 5 minutes later our fries, had to ask for our drinks twice. Would be nice to have it served all at once. Burgers are good, french fries not"}
{"text":"Jim's Burgers and Eggs is a nice, casual place to grab a \"quick\" sit down meal.  They have generous portions, food is overall pretty good.  My favorite so far is the Avocado burger and fries.    Have been there several times, and have found it to be \"hit or miss\" with being greeted and wait time for food.  We really enjoy their breakfasts, burger and fries.  It used to be pricier, but have recently reduced prices making it more of a lunch option.    Have a couple televisions wall mounted and strategically placed.  Nice place to meet a friend for burgers and chat.  My teenage daughter and I like to stop in and get to-go sometimes."}
{"text":"We gave this place a chance, IT WAS GREAT!food was good kiddo loved his burger and fries! Hubby loved the breakfast he ordered.I enjoyed my burger as well. the owner lady was there she was polite as well as staff. Lettuce was fresh and tomatoes too. Love it been back several times!"}
{"text":"Made an order today at Jims. When getting our food the older lady who owns or manages the place proceeded to yell at us for having a \"custom order\" because it messes up their food line. I'm sorry that holding the onions and jalapeños is an inconvenience for you, but it's also an inconvenience for my stomach. Lady then said that in the future she would not allow us to make a custom order! This place disgusts me! We have been to Jims numerous times and have forgiven this terrible lady for her absolute rudeness but today was just too much! If you value customer service do not go here. If you have ANY food allergy or intolerance DO NOT go here! I will be taking my money and great recommendations ELSEWHERE!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Love the owner lady, and the food is delicious.  Service has improved in leaps and bounds over the past couple years!!  Good job Jim's Burgers and Eggs!"}
{"text":"Jim now charges for yellow chili peppers! Wow.  What's next, will they start charging for ketchup or salt?? Man o man.. there already expensive as it is. I have been coming here since the 1st day they open. Never have I been charge.. but o well."}
{"text":"The food is really good here with good variety. We had been here 2 times before. Both times the food was great, but the staff is not only unfriendly, they are borderline rude. It had been a year since we had been here; so, we thought we'd try it again. Same rude result. In addition, the prices they charge are different from what's posted on the menu. They just said that they are old menus, and they haven't made new ones.   I ordered steak (medium rare)  & eggs. The steak came out well done. They took my steak back and left the rest of the food. About 12 minutes later, someone returned with another steak cooked well done. They took my entire plate. I asked for a refund and the waitress said ok. The owner then came out and said that they couldn't prepare any steak medium rare. I said, \"ok, just give me a refund.\" He then said that he'd prepare one medium rare. About 10 minutes later they brought out a new steak with the same half eaten eggs, hash browns and toast on a wiped off plate. When I wasn't ok with that, they called the waitress back and she told us that she was not allowed to talk to our table again. No one of the 5 in our party received any other service.   If the service was better... not even friendly staff, but not rude, they could easily earn 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good food, very poor customer service. Was my first time here and I asked how the ordering process worked. There was definitely a sigh and an attitude as if I was annoying this woman for just asking that. Actually asked her \"am I annoying you, or is there some kind of problem here?\" Pretty ridiculous. Sat down, inhaled our food and got the hell out of there. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Will never eat there again. Every time I have gone they mess up my order and talk shit about my order/me behind the counter right in front of me. I have food allergies I can't control that but to have your cook behind the counter basically saying \"why are they even ordering this\" and throwing a tantrum is unnecessary. I mean it's your job...I'm sorry my order bothers you but it's what I can eat at your establishment without getting sick. I have even told them I have allergies and the cook doesn't care he continues to mess up my order. When I specifically say to him it's an allergy he just gets annoyed that I confirm my order since I see him messing it up. I pay with my hard earned money to get food and I shouldn't feel bad for getting it the way I want so I can actually eat it without going to the hospital."}
{"text":"Ew, ew, ew, EW! Ordered $36 worth of food to-go only to find green eggs in my son's deluxe french toast. My hot pastrami sandwich-well, the meat was rainbowed and tasted like the smell of a port-o-potty. My mom said her mushroom Swiss burger was fine, likely due to the burger patty being frozen. Really disappointed this restaurant is the worst I've ever tried to eat at. Had high hopes this would be a new place to take my family since we live right around the corner. But never again."}
{"text":"Went there for Fathers Day breakfast.  We waited 45 minutes to get something to drink an an hour for our food.  While the food was good, it was not worth waiting an hour."}
{"text":"Very good food ! Straight shitty personalities! The owner lady and her daughter! Don't ask any questions they are moody ! Order pay and get the hell out ! No smiles out of them ! How do you run a business like that???? Good food shitty owners and staff!!!! Will not recommend this place to anyone !"}
{"text":"This seems to be an expensive diner.  The food is good and the lady that took our order was nice,l although not very knowledgable about the menu. When asked about a few menu items she gave the generic 'it's great\" response.  It was just the mister and I. 2 simple orders, but they came out separate and with a sizable delay. I had a sandwich, and he had a burger.  Both good, the burger was juicy and the fried were good too. But for the price, it may not be my first choice.  I am interested in going back to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"We try our best to do all of our shopping and dining locally in Surprise.  When I saw the diner being built I was excited to have a new choice.  We all got burgers, mine with an egg.  The fries were fairly good, the onion rings were fairly bad.  The bugers themselves were quite good however there were a mere sliver on a cross section of the sandwich.  It seemed like the burger was about a quarter of an inch in thickness.  I didn't see double or triples on the menu, but if we go back I'll shoot for that.  Also, don't forget your wallet, this place is very pricey for a burger joint."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve one star based all on the owners.  People who sponsored a fundraiser night for teenage boys who lost their lives in a car accident and ended up keeping the money.  Awful!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome, fresh, made to order! Service not so awesome. The older lady on register...doesn't like me, the customer in front of me, the customer behind me, the customer behind him, the customers at the back of the line, the customer at the tables, the customers on the patio, any customer!!! Nor does she care to enjoy any of her own staff. Oh heck, she just doesn't like anyone I believe. I'm sure just about everyone who has tried Jim's has a story about the cashier. It's almost funny bc she's in the line of work of customer service and interaction with the public. But does her bitterness shoo this family away? Nope, food is just that great! Just gotta overlook her lack of charm."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good; a little pricey for a diner but I'll get over it. The booths and small business feel is nice-it's a hard thing to find in Surprise. The real reason for my review is the customer service. This has nothing to do with the wait staff, they are always friendly and are endlessly moving to provide fast service to customers. My complaint is with the grouch behind the counter taking orders. I'm not sure if she's management or an owner but if she's not barking at an employee in front of you for something small she's talking to you like you're stupid as you order. Her aggressive demeanor is unnecessary (I've been a fair judge and been more than once and this is the case 100% of the time). There is a sign at the register that warns you as the customer of the \"Greek\" attitudes at play in the kitchen-I can find a burger someplace else minus the nasty tone, thanks very much. I can't imagine how a business can stay profitable with attitudes like this on the front line. If you don't have the tolerance for customers or people in general why on earth would you be the face of Jim's Burgers and Eggs?"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the past year and it was not bad. Yesterday I visited with my mom and we decided to eat outside. The tables were full of dirty dishes, and we pretty much had to set ours up. The menu says they have hot chocolate. No, they don't. The ketchup bottles, salt and pepper, and other table items were grimy and gross. And there was a long wait just to place an order. The Gyro was very good, but I was so grossed out by the grime and birds walking all over the tables fighting over food off the dirty plates, I just couldn't enjoy it. Not going back."}
{"text":"Damn good. Had a pastrami burger which was the best burger I've ever had with a lightly toasted bun and melt in your mouth pastrami. Clean venue with fast service. Perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"So my husbands is in LOVE with the style of burgers (pastromi especially) here.  They have HUGE servings that I think are worth the value.  Breakfast isn't anything fantastic but it is good.  I am always PLEASED with dinner and the service is GREAT!  The people know who we are and usually guess right what we are gonna order!!!  Love going there and will continue to suggest it to others!"}
{"text":"Crabby register lady has to go! I'm surprise they are still open because, she is not only rude to her staff, but also customers! Can you wait until people turn around to talk about them behind their backs at least??? The waitresses must have super thick skin to be working with her! The food is ok, but some places are better, very smoky when you walk in - not sure if the vent over the grill works? Overall, it's a so-so place except for Crabby Register Lady."}
{"text":"While their food is good, dealing with employees who don't understand how the MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) in Samsung Pay works is annoying and frankly, kind of embarrassing (for the business). When a cashier tells me that \"that won't work here, you need to pay with cash or credit card.\", they are simply demonstrating their ignorance. Just like when that same cashier tells me that they haven't set that system up. While I could pay with my card, I simply chose to cancel my order and go somewhere else. When I called back later, this same cashier informed me that she was the manager. While she was polite, there is no excuse to losing business due to being ignorant to new technology. Jim's uses a combo swipe/chip reader which is definitely compatible with Samsung Pay. The owner might want to get involved and educate his employees, as this method of payment using MST and tokenization is far more secure than handing somebody a piece of plastic. I expect that pretty soon, any establishment that doesn't want to risk losing revenue to ignorance, will update their employee training to cover different payment methods."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and the food is ok. Seems some things on the menu are good but the gravy over biscuits tastes like paste. My biggest problem is with the testy cashier who has a poor attitude. I questioned why the prices were different than on the menu and she snidely said \"we just haven't printed new menus yet! Look up at the board!\" No way to greet a customer. The owner is a rude Lady, so we stopped coming for awhile thinking perhaps it would be better. It seems the new cashier is her daughter who is equally as rude!  Wow! They have potential as a good neighborhood go to, but they should clean up their customer service. By the way the waitress, Kathy makes up for a lot as she is a great waitress!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try first day they opened....My mistake....The old lady on the cash register was just rude...and blamed it on the first day opening...  Gave them another chance a few months later... the service was better except it was dirty and the food sucked!!!  Dont think I'm coming back....I'll just go to Subway next door...."}
{"text":"Love this place! Burgers are amazing. Breakfast is even better. They can make you almost anything you want. Special mention are the fried zucchini which come in huge spears rather than little circles of breading like everywhere else."}
{"text":"We came to try this place because we bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate. After we placed our order the cashier said that they don't accept them anymore. We ordered a burger and onion rings. The burger had a nice flavor. The onion rings were good but a bit too greasy."}
{"text":"The customer service is very poor. When you first walk in you're greeted with a a scowl and arms crossed from a women who seems rather impatient. There's a sign posted saying \"no cell phones while ordering.\" Even if you need to read an order off of your phone, she will ask you to go to the end of the line and memorize the order.   Aside from that, the Ortega burger is amazing paired with some onion rings and an ice cold drink. The food usually comes pretty quickly even when it's really busy. The restaurant has a very open space with some outdoor seating as well. I use to come to here exclusively for the ortega burger, but the cashier every-single-time has been so rude. Not only that ive been charged incorrectly twice. At this point i'd honestly rather just go to wendy's for a burger."}
{"text":"I am usually not one to do reviews unless the service was extraordinary or horrible. In this case, the food is mediocre but the service was HORRIBLE. This is not the first time I have received this type of service there. The owner is very rude, talks down to employees and customers, and is very argumentative. I work right around the corner and we frequently make trips here for lunch. We excused her service the first few times but have decided as a group that we will no longer be giving them our service.  The first instance: We went in for a breakfast trip where we ordered 5 \"Mexican burritos\". We asked for hot sauce and she responded back with, \"What does this look like a Mexican restaurant to you? We don't have hot sauce.\"  Second instance: I was sent by 3 people to retrieve their order's and I apologized in advance for having to order 4 separate meals because I was paying 4 different ways. At first, she assured me that it was fine and we would get it taken care of. Shortly into the order, she began to get frustrated, huffing and puffing to make it clear. Third instance: We called in an order for 4 and decided to pay together to make it easier on them. When we got there to pick it up (20min. after order was placed) it hadn't even begun to be made. We waited an additional 15 min. only to find out that the order was wrong once we got back to work. We called to let them know and they assured us that they would make it right and have the correct order ready for us when we came back. We got there and again and the owner started arguing with me about what we ordered and that they made exactly what we asked for. I was the one who placed the order and the wrong order was my meal so I tried to explain that to her. She got very irritated and insisted that I was wrong and they were right. They finally corrected it and I thanked her and told her that she was very rude and that we would never be back again."}
{"text":"Such a great place. The food was great service was fast. Great lil spot on the west side laid back atmosphere and a sense of a home town diner"}
{"text":"Someone talked me into giving them another chance.  Still not great food. Still rude as hell."}
{"text":"Upon arrival the girl taking orders at the counter was kind of rude and very unfriendly could tell she definitely did not want too be there. Took about 15 minutes after we sat down too get our drinks. Then aprox 27 minutes from the time I paid too get 2 burgers and fries. The woman handing out plates of food was apologetic for the wait and seemed nice maybe she should work the register and be the first face too greet people. Overall food was okay don't think I'll ever come back"}
{"text":"1st time eating here. we tried jim's based off of yelp reviews & i'm definitely happy we did! good menu, good service & great food... definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The place grows on you. The head honcho seems to have calmed down and the employees seem happier. Food is still mediocre."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and food was raw ..   they can't seem to make a burger correctly"}
{"text":"Ate there tonight w/my son and some friends. It was our first visit & the name intrigued us and we decided to try it after picking up our kids from an engineering class.  Between the four of us we had burgers, breakfasts & sandwich.  My son's & my orders were delivered pronto. We were shorted a full order of fries & my sandwich was so bad (I had the albacore tuna) I got ill by the time I got home.  It was salty & almost inedible and i couldnt eat it. My friend's meals were sliw in getting to her, her daughter's meal was incorrect and it took a few tries to get them to remedy it.  My friend even got out of her chair & went to the counter & told the owner.  Nada! Yes, they apologized, but did nothing to compensate & the owner didn't come over and see if things were made right.  Between bad service, bad food, and abyssmal customer service, our first visit is most definitely our last"}
{"text":"There are times when this is the best place ever to eat and then there's the why did we come here. But over all a place I would send someone to that wants an burger that doesn't have the fast food clone taste.  Great F Frys, drinks are a nice size, and lots of menu items to chose from.  During Breakfast you can have Lunch items as well.  For Breakfast if you want your hash brown potatoes crispy, they will take the time to make them crispy for you. Only reason I don't give them a 4 star is that you can tell, I mean really tell when the staff isn't getting along, and it makes me wonder if the focuses on the food and service are the priority.  Can't be just a bad day when its several days."}
{"text":"Remember the broohaha caused by Amy's Baking Company? These people are worse!   I live close by so my family and I stopped in on a saturday morning for a midmorning breaksfast  I had heard it was decent and they were robbed a while back, so it seemed like a place worth visiting.  The line was about 5 people deep, not too bad.  When I got up to the counter to order, a middle aged lady (later we found out she was the owner's wife) was yelling and berating one of the young servers for a perceived slight.  Unprofessional to say the least and it made me really uncomfortable.   We placed our order for a sandwich, omelet, waffle and french toast.  The place is small so we had to wait a bit for a table.  We found one a few minutes later and I went to fill up my coffee mug.  They only had artificial creamer so I asked a busser for  some milk.  He was a nice young kid and went to ask Jim, ho was frying eggs for some actual milk.  It seemed like Jim lost his mind a little at that point.  He literally jumped around in the open kitchen area, waiving his arms in the air, looking for a milk jug.  I thanked him for the milk and he flat out ignored me and went back to grilling.  We sat down and waited for our food.  And waited .  And waited.  45 minutes in my husband went to ask the owner's wife what had happened to our food and was told \"well, it will be at least an hour wait\".  Hmmm.  There were maybe 30 people in this place tops and it takes an hour to make some eggs?  An hour and 5 minutes later our food comes out, in thee separate deliveries.  The waffle was burnt.  The french toast was soggy and sloppy and not in a good way.  My veggie omelet was made with artificial cheese product, which they hadn't even bothered to melt completely since it was slapped on top of the omelet in squares  This is when it gets interesting.  My husband's sandwich was so dry it was inedible.  So he went up to the counter.  The owners' wife started yelling at him, saying \"what did you order, what was it?\" He told her \"it's right in front of your face, here is the plate\".  She then started yelling \"well that is what you get when you order a sandwich without mayo and dry\".  He told her that he didn't special order anything, it was ordered right off the menu.  She didn't offer to remake it, just kept screaming at him.  At that point he calmly told her \"look, this food is terrible and I would like a refund for this item\" Then Jim started screaming at him \"my food is not terrible, your brain is terrible!\".  The poor young waitstaff stood around, shocked and embarrassed. We were so shocked that we just left.  An hour later, I was in the bathroom with stomach cramps from this food.  This experience put a damper on what should have been a lovely morning of shopping.  My guess is that the only reason this place is still open is because we are out in the middle of nowhere and until the mall opens, they are the only game in town.  But please, Nicks' diner, although not exactly gourmet, knocks the socks off this place.  If you want to have a terrible breakfast, wait hours or more for your food and get a slew of insults for free with your order, this is the place for you.  I am waiting for Gordon Ramsey or the yelp community to catch on to this restaurant, it should be fun to watch how they react to another complaining customer."}
{"text":"Love love love the hamburgers. They are always busy but do a good job getting everyone through the line quickly. This is one of my favorite places to eat"}
{"text":"We're new in the area and drove by here on the way to church. We finally decided to go there one Sunday morning and everything seemed to be going well. There was no line, we placed our order and sat in the patio. I decided to go to Fry's next door while my husband and kids waited for our order. I rushed through Fry's....spent maybe 10 minutes there and ran back thinking our food would be ready. It wasn't.   The drinks came, with one missing, our son's chocolate milk. We WAITED another 10. Nothing. Waited another....looked around, others being antsy as well. Another table got up and went in to see where their food was. They finally got it after 10 minutes.  About 40 minutes later, I told my husband to go ask if our food was close to being ready and if not, to ask for our money back. They haven't even started on it. It was just breakfast food: eggs, etc... So we got our money back and left. The lady behind the counter said it's like this when we're busy. Well...isn't it like this for everyone...but we still get our food? We would have loved to try what they had to offer, but they didn't give us a chance..."}
{"text":"I always come to Jims, being from California its the only \"california style\" burger I can find here!  Burgers are always great but service not so much. They go through employees like crazy it seems. Everytime I go there is always a new face.   Well, today I figured out why. I had placed an over there phone order with the owners wife and she had informed me it would be 45 minutes. No big deal, I couldn't take my break for about a half an hour anyways. When I had arrived the owners wife was standing at the counter, guns hot as she always is, and asked me what I needed. I told her I had placed an order and was here to pick it up (I called at 11 and it was now 11:50). She had informed me it would be another 25 minutes.  After this, she yells at me \"well do you want the food or not?!\" Really lady? After yelling back the food should already be done, she screams again, \"well, excussssse me\" in front of a line of customers waiting to order. Nice impression lady!  To say the least, I probably won't be back again. Not my first encounter with her rude attitude, but quite frankly the worst.  I had gone for breakfast one morning on a sunday and it took an hour and thirty minutes to get bacon and eggs, then had to ask for my toast which was supposed to come with it. Angry customers who were asking for their money back were quickly told they couldn't and wouldnt give anyone's money back. Again, to say the least, never went to breakfast there again!!!   Love the food, but the owners wife ruins the whole entire atmosphere. If she had better customer service and didnt scare off staff im sure they would be much more successful.   (I actually know a gal who worked there, and was told to \"meet the sink\" for 3 hours and do dishes when she was supposed to be serving food) yikes."}
{"text":"The burgers are yummy and quality was good. I ordered pastrami burger and like it.  The service is week though. First of all they have rude and unfriendly cashier. She was a middle age lady and I told her \"it's my first time coming here, what do you suggest me to order?\" This is how she answered, unbelievable:  \"Well you got to choose faster sir, there are 4 people behind you!\"  They just serve the food and it's only one server for all tables. If you want fork for fries, you need to find a way yourself. I ordered sugar for my iced tea and never received it. The server is not even checking other tables to see if they need anything or no. And of course it's because she's busy and she has to do everything by herself.  So except the food, there's nothing more attractive going on."}
{"text":"The food is very good but the lady with the accent is friggin bii**h. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"The food is great. There are plenty of theme restaurants where angry, rude staff is part of the gimmick. I think the difference is these folks seem to actually mean it. Its not an act here. Go with an empty stomach, a thick skin and enjoy the show!"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are good but the lady that runs, maybe owns the place is just about as rude and very unthankful as it gets. I came in today ordered Togo for two. The inside was busy and I did not want to take the last clean table to sit and wait. I was attempting to be courteous so I went and sat outside. After about 10 min I go in and ask her if she could have someone get me outside when my food is ready. She proceeded to raise her voice and explain that's not the way it works here and I needed to hang out and wait for my number to be called.  I will not step foot in again or refer any of my customers that are hungry to go there."}
{"text":"I haven't even tasted a bite of my food.  1. Understaffed 2. Lady at the counter, rude. 3. Not enough seating. 4. Table was dirty. 5. Wife added bacon to her order at the counter. Lady at the counter acted like we did something terribly wrong. 6. At least Two different patrons cancelled their order due to excessive wait time. 7. One patron received the wrong order and had to argue with the counter lady to get his point across. 8. Food took 40 min to get to our table. 9. Food we as decent but service was horrible! Very disappointed, I have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  This was unfortunately the last time too."}
{"text":"Okay so we went back a few weeks ago and got to order food that didn't take forever to get. I suggest to not go on a weekend unless you want to wait. The burgers are good and so is the fried mushrooms. It's your typical burger place nothing too special but it's close so we will go again just not on a weekend."}
{"text":"Extremely rude service and basic food. We have been here a few times and service was ok. However our last visit was over the top as far as how badly we were treated. We won't return. I'm surprised they've stayed open as long as they have given the service."}
{"text":"Food has been verry good on my last 5 trips here. Workers are ok I have had worse, some need a kick in the butt but most are good. I like this place because of the food and protion sizes."}
{"text":"My wife, sister in law, and myself ate here today. All three ordered the quarter pound charburger, all three got food poisoning. Also, the food took over thirty minutes to get to our table. The service left something to be desired. I would have given only one star, based on how I'm feeling right now; but I've eaten here twice before without incident. I don't think I'll be returning. I hope this was an isolated incident and no other customers had this happen today."}
{"text":"This place has amazing burgers. When I go eat I could care less how the waiters or staff are to be honest. I'm not like all these complainers who want people to bow down to them because they spend a little money. So on a possitive note, this place had great customer service and the burgers are so good. Lenny's, five guys and in n out have nothing on Jim's. The food came out fast and everything was fresh. We drive from the 101 and peoria to go have the burgers, if that tells you how much we love this place. Don't read all the bad reviews on people who go to restaurants to complain. If you want a GREAT burger then you have to try this place out. Keep up the great work Jim!!!"}
{"text":"Jim's is a \"look up\" restaurant with a good variety of classic American food.  Breakfast is served all day.  I can't think of any other place in Surprise that fits this niche in a faster-food format.  NY Flavor is close, but a different menu selection.  Went on Father's day and there was a pretty good crowd, but also resulted in a pretty long wait time.  Took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and got food at the 25 minute mark.  Food was good, not worth the wait good, but I will give them the benefit since it was Father's day and maybe they had a larger than normal crowd.  Pros: Large Menu Breakfast Served All Day Large Portions Large (very large) drinks Very tasty food Reasonable prices for the type of eatery  Cons: Slow, very slow.  25+ min to get food (might have been because it was father's day). Lady behind the counter (owner?, manager? or just someone in charge?) was barking orders at staff, to the point that it I think it was slowing them down.  In all, I think this place will do well here in surprise.  Nothing else really like it as all other places that serve similar food are sit-down places.  I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"i went to Jim's for the first time on Sunday - 02/26/2012. We were invited by a bunch of our friends and family, as they have eaten there before and were very happy.  We arrived at 10:30 AM, and the restaurant was half full. Our group was already there, and we stood in line at the counter. While at the counter, the woman taking the orders would write them down on a short-hand pad, and yell something to the cooks, and the runners. There was clearly very little organization. The design of an open kitchen was interesting, but with all of the yelling, it seems like she has delusions of a Gordon Ramsey-esque eatery.  We looked over the menu for quite a while, as it was taking about 3 minutes per customer to get the order, write it down, and process payment. My wife settled upon the Ribeye / Eggs, I selected the Eggs / Sausage, we ordered two stacks of pancakes for the kids. We ordered one large drink, and two kids drinks.  In the middle of taking my order, the Manager/Owner *Not sure here* Lady was distracted when another customer (my bother-in-law) approached the counter and told her they were missing some items. The manager told one of the runners to finish my order, while the manager dealt with my brother-in-law. The runner rang me up, and verified the order. My wife had asked for her eggs to be egg white only, and that was the only special part of our order.  Before I left the cash register area, I was shocked to hear how the manager was treating my brother-in-law. He had just spent over $60 for his family of 5, and she did not believe that he was missing a meal. She went over to his table to count the number of dishes, and then realizing he was correct - did not apologize, simply went back to the cash register, SCREAMED at the cooks to finish the order, and then went on to help the next customer in line.   While waiting for our breakfast to arrive, the cook came out to the table and said they could not make her eggs with only egg whites. I told them to just make them over medium and serve it on a separate plate - that she would cut aound the yolks. No problem from my perspective. This caused much conversation and confusion in the kitchen, to which the three cooks turned and looked at me for a moment, and then turned back to their cooking.  The manager finally brought out my brother-in-law's missing plates of food, and it seemed as though they were satisfied.  My food arrived, eggs, sausage, hash browns, toast. My wife's food arrived - steak, eggs (on a side plate! good job!), hash browns, missing the toast. My kids food arrived - just one of the two pancake stacks. We told the kids to cut them up and share while I went up to tell them we were missing the toast and the pancakes.  I first told one runner that we were missing the items... 5 minutes later I told another runner we were missing the items.... 5 minutes later, a runner brought over a pancake meal and a hamburger to my son - I told her that was not his, he was only getting the pancakes, no eggs or sausage, and no hamburger - she realized it was another customer's food, and apologized, took the food and headed off.  I went up to the cashier/manager and told her we were still missing the toast and pancakes. She told me - no, we gave you those. I tuned to look at the table, and there was no toast, no pancakes. I told her we had not yet received the items, and she just looked at me. She turned around, grabbed the toast from another order and sort of thrust the plate into my hand. I wasn't expecting it, and half the toast fell to the floor. I looked up at her as the other half fell to the floor. I was done.  I am 40 years old. I have never, not once, done what I'm about to tell you in my entire life. But I had seen enough. There was a line of customers out the door waiting to get to the cashier. My family / group was nearly done eating their food. I had a few bites from my food. I had spent $28.00 on my family of 4. All told, my group had spent about $150 combined on all of our meals. I was so upset at how she treated her employees, and how she felt my brother-in-law was lying about the missing food, and how she treated me when I asked for my missing food. I lost it.  I went back to the table, told my wife, very loudly - I'm done - I'm leaving - Let's go. I picked up my 9 month old daughter and started to head for the door. I could peripherally see the manager watching me leave, so I changed directions and headed to the cashier station.  I told her, \"You should be ashamed of yourself. The way you treat your employees, and the way to treat your customers is horrible!\" I was very loud - I could sense the other patrons in line move away backwards toward the wall. The manager asked me \"What, because you didn't get toast?!?\" I told her, \"It's not the toast, it was the fact that you felt we were lying to you about the missing orders, it's they way you treat people, you should be on 'Restaurant Impossible!'\"  She said nothing. We left."}
{"text":"My family and I had burgers and sandwiches here just a few days after they opened. The food wasn't bad (fresh ingredients). The service and decor need a little more work. The prices are a bit too high. And I have to disagree with the previous review though as the fries were nowhere near the size of steak fries, the portion of the fries was not overly generous, and this restaurant does not have a \"Greek slant\".  All in all, it's worth a try, and I will go back to see how their breakfast is, but if the service doesn't improve, I'll go elsewhere for a burger and eggs."}
{"text":"I just can't get past the terrible customer service.  They told us our order would be ready in 10 minutes, we are 15 minutes away.  We got there, paid, and the food wasn't ready for 20 more minutes, and she had the nerve to have attitude when I asked how long, that it was supposed to be ready (they hadn't started).   Skip the grilled cheese, they use processed cheese, like Kraft (but tasted more like Wal-Mart brand).  and the gyro's are meh.....  Lastly, I have asthma, I had to leave and wait outside for my food, there was so much greasy smoke in the air, it makes it really hard to breathe. Just nothing special about their food, and the attitude you get is just stupid."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was not impressed. Below average tasting food. The waiters were nice but seemed to not know the menu. The girl who was delivering food to the tables had no idea what we ordered and who got what. We were here for dinner and all got a hamburger, fries and salad. Also the building needs to be better ventilated. It was so smokey and hard to breathe at times with how much smoke was coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Two stars is being generous, I have been here a few times but now starting to realize it is not worth it anymore. The waitresses are fantastic but the rude ogre lady taking food orders always ruins my meal before it even begins. Honestly I have no idea who in their right mind could work under the rule of those two. This place WAS good when they first open.... now not so much. Do yourself a favor and go to Nicks 2 and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"My daughter and a I had lunch there yesterday.   We both had burgers.  I had the special for $6 50 it was good but I like Culver's better.  My daughter is an IN N OUT snob so what l can say.  The problem here is the staff needs to put a smile on there face and learn to say  HI WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU TODAY AND SAY THANKYOU."}
{"text":"As much as I would like to give 1 star the food after waiting 45 mins was actually pretty good. This review starts with what all other yelpers have commented on and that is the rude ass lady who takes your money. Bigger lady with glasses. Throws my number almost at me and let's me know that they do not have grapefruit juice right now with major attitude. After the wait for food I get my omelette but of course no silverware. Then when I ask if I can have some the waitress asks \"does everyone here need silverware\" ?????? Wtf lol. 4 big hungry dudes. No we eat with our hands. They need to be happy people still go and treat people better. Would never go back"}
{"text":"I love Jim's!!! Had the Chorizo & Eggs plate yesterday. It was amazing! Never have had a bad meal at Jim's.  *Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here breakfast and lunch. Food is great and plentiful. Service is good as well"}
{"text":"Everything we have eaten here has been delicious.  The owners are super nice and friendly.  The pastrami is like the kind you can get in L.A. and the burgers remind me of Spartan Burgers in H.P. - yum!  Delicious.  Burgers, pastrami, fries, onion rings, breakfast, -- all good stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is a jewel here in Surprise AZ. As a native of southern California ( Orange  County)  Finding a good charbroiled Burger is hard to come by. Back home these mom & pop Burger joints are everywhere. Jims moved from Cali to surprise and opened his shop here.  Not only are the burgers to die for,  the pastrami sandwich is a must.  While I'm at it try the breakfast specials.  When ever I'm feeling home sick I  come here for a good double cheese  burger special."}
{"text":"It's an average place with average food. The owner is a jerk. I witnessed him start yelling at an employee to the point where she was crying. It's insane that he did that in the public view.  I returned today for a meeting and found a laminated sign taped to the registers that started off with \"Warning\" and went into an explanation of the staff being Greek and that you may witness yelling, screaming, and profanities.   At least they recognize how horrible their behavior is.   For my food today, I got the burger fries and a drink special for $6.80. It was a little better from the last time. The ingredients tasted fresh."}
{"text":"I have never had such terrible customer service experience. I called in for an omlette and paid extra for mushrooms. I also asked for dry wheat toast...with no butter. When we go the food home and started eating the omlette we noticed that there were almost no mushrooms in it. Then we noticed butter all over our toast.  I called and asked if I could come back and get my order...bringing back what we had. When I arrived, the owner Jim refused, saying that he wouldn't replace it because it'd been eaten. I tried to explain the situation but he was so rude and continued to refused.  We will never go back! :-("}
{"text":"Good food, and affordable. I use to go to a place like this in California but this is better. I had the double burger and my wife bad the gyro. Both were very good and were generous portions. It's very clean too."}
{"text":"I have given them fair chances and have never been impressed. The food is heat and serve with nothing that really stands out. It's adequate enough...but nothing special.  Wait times for food can be hit or miss with no rhyme or reason.   The problem at Jim's is the counter service. The woman who works at the counter is about as rude as it gets. It almost feels like we were supposed to thank HER instead of her thanking customers for coming in. I don't know why she still works here; I have to assume she's an owner or really good friends with the owners because her continued employment is a mystery to me. Twice while we were there, cooks quit in the middle of their shift after having what seemed to be a good argument with her.   There are better places in Surprise. Don't settle for crappy service."}
{"text":"This is the worst type of place! 1st of all it's in a strip mall so you know 6 months from now it will be a T-Mobile. 2nd of all the staff is RUDE! I asked what kid if cheese they offered and they elderly lady behind the counter seemed very upset that I was even there ordering. The walls and floors were not clean my table needed to be wiped down and I had to ask twice before it was cleaned. It took forever to get my food and they were not that busy. Some old man and young guy were fighting so loud in the back room I could hear them at my table. They offer free refills on drinks but you have to go back to the counter to get it and they act mad that you want a refil. 3rd the food. Average at best. I was so hoping the burgers would be good. The bun was nice. But the lettuce was turing brown and the tomatoe was soggy. The patty itself was dry and over cooked. I also ordered zuchinni sticks and they were ok. They chop them long ways and bread them but one was not cooked all they way. Surprise needs a good burger joint and this is not it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Onion rings and fries were both perfect! We also had a BLT which was so yummy. Will be back!"}
{"text":"If you like cranky cashiers, over-priced fast food, and filthy tables and condiment bottles, this place is for you!  The older lady at the register is the rudest person you will EVER meet. For what they charge for fast food, she should be eternally grateful for every person that walks through the door."}
{"text":"Used to eat here frequently but got tired of the poor service. Food is pretty good but not worth the trouble with the lady in front.  The end."}
{"text":"I love lunch for breakfast and my husband loves a hearty breakfast. This is the place. Great size portions and the same friendly faces. Every time I go in the restaurant is buzzing  with full tables inside and out. Great family style atmosphere. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Walked in for the first time and the older woman at the register was immediately rude and very unhelpful when were asking about the menu since it was our first time there. However, the food came out very quickly and was absolutely amazing. The young girl who brought it out was very nice and courteous. Beside the grumpy lady who described the egg burger as \"egg and burger\", ugh so rude! But anyways, great food, good quick service."}
{"text":"We stopped into the small spot thought we give it a try. I ordered the Mexican omlet & my bf order a cheeseburger with green Chile's and I've got to say they were both awesome!! We will be returning soon.."}
{"text":"I'm from the north so the rudeness doesn't bother me.  This is the closest I'll get to a coney Island in Arizona, so I'll take it.  The food is very good and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Overall, this place just is plain awful. Some of the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Took them almost 30 minutes before they even got our drinks out to us, and another 45 for or food. Not to mention the waitresses are always confused and have no idea where any of their food is going. I saw one waitress walk around the dining room for 15 minutes trying to figure where a hot tea went (the people who it went to left because of the service.) The food is barely mediocre so you could basically get it anywhere else which I would highly recommend. Do not come here if you don't  want to be irritated by the lack of hospitality & good food. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"Update 20150430: I dropped these idiots down two stars. Lesson to be learned, guys: if you want people to continue to like your FB page, don't delete their comments on your posts for absolutely no reason. And quit posting duplicate images there, nobody wants to see the same burger photo every single week. You want to manipulate social media, no prob, enjoy the result.  -- original review follows --- Still four stars and still the best burgers in Surprise (in fact quite probably the entire West Side, although admittedly I haven't actually eaten at ALL the burger joints on the WS). However, there are a couple of disappointing aspects. Firstly, I tend to agree about the front-desk woman. Sometimes (RARELY) she has good days and has had a friendly comment for me in the past. But if there's more than one person in line she doesn't handle it well, just wants to get your order and get you out of her face. Your best bet is to prepare your order in your mind well before you get to the counter and then just clearly state it to her without asking any questions. Ask anything and she'll tire of you real quick. Other server girls are fine. Except for the one dunce that looked at me weirdly when I asked for water, then when departing my table area promptly bumped her shoulder right into the corner of a wall and went \"Ow!\" Her face was sour as a lemon's @rse for the rest of the time we were in there.  They are now just filling glasses of water and leaving them on the front counter just to the left of where you order. If you want water and are dining in, don't forget to grab a cup on your way to a table.  This place REALLY needs to throw away their mustard and ketchup bottles and get new ones. They're evidently the same bottles, possibly never washed or wiped but refilled a thousand times since they first opened. The mustard bottles are dingy. The ketchup bottles look like props from a Ron Jeremy flick. There's no reason why they can't simply get proper, clean squirt bottles for the tables and have some sort of semblance of cleanliness - I feel like I want to wash my hands after every time I touch those things. I would normally give this place a flat three, but it still keeps its quad-star rating based purely on the taste of the food, everything I've had here or seen others have here looks and tastes all-world. The main guy knows what he's doing and it's all out quickly and efficiently. And you can tell the cuisine is good by how busy the place gets at mealtimes.  They've had this same sign on the tables for months now, something about a \"coming soon\" promotion from Limelight Networks that will allow them to advertise local businesses. Hasn't happened yet, dunno what that's all about. Finally, I'd suggest that this place quit doing their ridiculous car shows every so often and jamming up the parking lot with what appear to be clunkers salvaged straight out of Bubba's Wrecking Yard. Burgers have nothing to do with cars. Neither does yogurt. That yogurt place down by Reems and Greenway did car shows and we all know what happened to them, eh?  Anyway. GO EAT AT JIM'S. And always remember, deliver your order slowly and clearly to counter lady. Questions or small talk carry a risk."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while.  Last time we ate there we all got sick from what we believe was old chili.   Friends and family have been and all of them complain of poor service.  I would suggest another spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS. I had an awful experience as far as customer service goes. There food was decent, but the same food can be found at plenty of other restaurants that care about their customers. I wanted to substitute pancakes instead of toast and told them that and they never said anything about \"no substitutions\" nor was it written anywhere prominent. Instead I found out I was charged $4 for my pancakes by the price of everything. Didn't even get the toast I technically paid for. Then I also asked for over medium eggs but the whites were clearly super undercooked so I asked for new ones. My original order came with three eggs, but they brought out only two when they \"fixed\" it. By that time I was full and needed to leave so obviously I didn't have them remake it, but that was all they were willing to do. Idk where there manager was the entire time. Then to top it all off i realized they charged us for an extra $2 large drink. Went to tell the cashier and she was just AWFUL. Don't go here unless you support awful service. Also their iced coffee was bad."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Very poor service. The ribeye \"steak\" is a simple breakfast steak that is very thin and they couldn't say how many ounces it was because \"they cut them themselves\". Maybe 5 ounces at most at the price of 12. And whatever seasoning they added ruined a ribeye's natural flavor. We won't go back though we were really hoping it would be good. All our kids said Five Guys is much better. Don't see this one sticking around long."}
{"text":"Customer Service: 3 out of 5 Price: 4 out of 5 Food: 3 out of 5 Overall experience: 3 out of 5  It was our first time eating here. I ordered avocado burger with french fries and large drink. I usually like and eat any burgers. Unfortunately, I did not like their burger... burger is big, about the same size with Curls Jr. Patty is very thin and it did not taste any different than you cool at home. My husband ordered onion rings. It was just very oily onion ring without any flavor... I wouldn't come back for their burger. I would come back someday to try their breakfast menu. :)"}
{"text":"This is fried and grilled food paradise.  All the food is fresh and these guys knnow how to do it!  The menu is extensive and pretty much anyhting you order is fantastic!  The fried zucchini is to die for and the the chorizo and eggs doesn't get any better!    The service is #1 as well...you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"The best California Char-brolied burgers in the West Valley. So much of the breakfast looks really good too."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's one of the few places in town that serve eggs on their burgers besides ihop. The staff seem local and friendly. This is a solid diner that can be hit and miss with service depending on time of day. I also like the chicken stips... Basic I know... But nowhere else in surprise serves them locally. The breakfast is top notch and served all day.  The prices can seem a little high... But it's worth the try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best Burger I have had in the area, Delicious! Had a double stacked burger with all the fixens, bacon & avacado. I saw it on their website and had to have it. Very impressed with the quality. Also I saw Jim behind the counter making burgers wich I thought was cool he looks just like the cartoon picture of him! Would come back again and reccomend"}
{"text":"Never really had an issue with the food. Except a arm or chest hair in my ranch (yuck)!Just the staff is rude. Heard the waitress taking crap about me and my party that we were asking for too much stuff. Like napkins and forks :)    I still go there even though they are rude. I just get it to go."}
{"text":"We have been here in the past and have been very pleased with the food and service. Went there last night about 745. (They close at 9)My wife witnessed one of the cooks expression saying the \"f bomb \" as we walked in and made eye contact. Not a good feeling as a customer, but are not getting free food! I ordered the Philly steak and cheese sandwich, very skimpy on the meat. I wouldn't recommend it, Rays on Union Hills & 35th ave will show you how it's done!!!  We took a long drive to go to Jim's, hopefully you can put more Love in your business."}
{"text":"Jim's is sooo good! If you haven't tried this place in Surprise, definitely make the trip! We stumbled upon it and we are so glad we did. They have a bit of everything therefore everyone be can always find something they want. Their club sandwich is AMAZING!!! And the portion size is huge! We have also tried their avocado burger, fruit covered waffle, pastrami sandwich, chorizo plate, mushroom burger, eggs and bacon plate, and bacon burger. Everything has been fantastic.    The place is always clean, the service is decent, the prices are right on, the portion size is huge, and the wait for your food is never long. Give this place a try.... You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit here and it was complicated.. So I brought my friend and I here for brunch and ordered their french toast deluxe without the bacon ans sausage but an extra egg as I don't eat red meat or pork. I also order a large apple juice. It took the server/ runner 3 tries to get the sizing right. Then 15 minutes later my food comes out. Keep in mind I had only french toast and eggs, my friend ordered a burger meal and it was out before mine. They gave her the overcooked bottom of the fryer fries and my eggs weren't seasoned at all. Then I had to ask for utensils after the server left because there werent any on the table. The servers were very stressed and you could tell because there was alot of attitude going around.. The food was good all in all but after I left within 10 minutes my stomache started to hurt. I believe its because they cooked my food on the same griddle as the burgers and the red meat juice intermingled with it. Couldn't taste it over all the syrup n strawberries but I pretty much wasted my money since it made me sick. Its also very expensive, they need to change the $ to $$ for just my friend and I it was over 20 dollars. The meal prices do not include drinks. Typical pricing for here is 5.95-6.95 for just your food. Drink is about 2ish I think but I got juice so it was 2.95. And of couse the fruit was another extra 2.95.. So it adds up. I'm just not digging the atmosphere there so I will probably never go in again.. Save myself from getting sick again and having crap service.."}
{"text":"We've been eating here since the place opened about 3 years ago.  The food has always been good for counter service diner style food and its usually 4 to 5 stars.  Never had a problem with quality or value for price.  I personally love the pastrami burger and country omelette. The place reminds me of the counter service diners I've been to in downtown Chicago in many ways (anyone reading this old enough to remember the \"cheeseburger\"sketch on SNL??).  HOWEVER- Service is something that could improve. They seem to go through staff like paper towels. I think that may be part of the issue and its a sign of a core issue in management/ownership. Ordering at counter is usually not a bad experience, but I have to agree, that Jim's wife is not a warm and fuzzy person.  I have been working in service for the last 30 years and I wouldn't have lasted that long if I I wasn't welcoming and accommodating to my  guests.  I don't frequent another area diner at Greenway and Reems for that very reason- poor customer service.    Yesterday was my worst experience there ever.  It was very busy, which you would expect for 10AM Saturday.  My 7 year old son really wanted to have breakfast there, so despite the crowd, we ordered.  Every table was full and most were waiting for orders..  I figured it would be a wait, but maybe only 10 minutes longer than usual.  I was mistaken, It took  almost 1 hour from the time we ordered until our food came.  This was breakfast.  Quick and easy to prepare. 1 Hour????  When our food did arrive, nothing was wrong with it, but our server, was obviously pushed to her limits (only 2 servers working that morning).  She forgot syrup for my sons pancake and I had to get up and get.  No one behind the counter even apologized , even though I was obviously put off I had to get my own condiments.  The water I ordered from her never came either.  Very poor service to say the least.  I understand, bad days happen at every job, but maybe they could have been proactive at the counter and let people know how long the wait time for food was going to be?  Since you pay in advance here, its difficult to get a refund.  And then last night on Facebook, instead of posting an apology to their loyal (an inconvenienced) customers, they posted marketing pictures of their food.  Really??  Maybe an apology with an offer to bring in your breakfast receipt for a discount on a return visit would have been a better idea?  We will return, but you're on final notice with us Jim's.  We want to patronize local businesses, but food alone doesn't cut it in this business.  You need to provide friendly, expedited service too!"}
{"text":"I dug it. Just went in with no expectations didn't browse the menu, too many options lol. I just got the special of the day and it was really good. I love the old diner feel with the grumpy old women that come by with coffee. I'd go back more if they opened up before 7 so I can eat there before work bc I was really affordable and fast.  But oh well it will be a weekend spot for sure."}
{"text":"Jim makes great food-hands down, however, the grouchy beoutch that asked us to move down the line so she could take our order then bitched about us standing there will cause folks to dine else where. Older large female with a scowl from hell on her face the entire time we were there. She continued to complain loud enough to other employees about us standing (where she told us to  stand), when I asked if she wanted to chat to find out where the break down was, she glared at us and continued to be snarky to other customers. Jim, your food is great, but you need to rid your restaurant of this cantankerous old witch!"}
{"text":"They have great good and best fries I have. Cheap prices and the people are friendly besides the wife owner behind the cash register."}
{"text":"Last Sunday morning a group of six of us came for breakfast. The food was fine, but after 40 o asked about my food and was told \"it's the weekend\". My friend didn't get his food for over an hour. He tried to cancel at the one hour mark and was told they had started the order; no canceling. He got his food at one hour and ten minutes. Afterward he tried to talk to the owner, Jim. Jim refused to discuss it. He said it was the Greek Easter. I'll never go back to a place that has so little regard for their customers."}
{"text":"So where else in Surprise would you ever get a Pastrami burger! A great one at that. Phyllis and Jim never disapoint."}
{"text":"Food is good customer service is horrible so much so I don't want to go there anymore."}
{"text":"Old school SoCal style mom and pop burgers and more kind of shop. The guy on the menu is the guy on the grill . Take the time to say hello to his wife at the register and ask a few questions, you will find your meal prepared the way you want and new friends"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The food is delicious & the prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend their veggie burger!"}
{"text":"I came back to this place because the food was awesome, but I was really off put by the rude a** older lady with the glasses who worked the register this time. I came up, ordered, she asked me if it's for here or to go. I said for here. Then she said ma'am I don't have time for this we have a line. Is this for here or to go? I said I said it's for here. And I'm really confused by what you're talking about. She pointed to a no cell phone sign and said she's just not wanting to step on anybody's toes. I said okay (WTF?!?!).   I answered her question immediately and didn't understand why she needed to be rude. Yes I glanced down at my phone, but after I answered her. So why are you talking to me like a child? F off."}
{"text":"Sitting here still waiting for our food, after ordering an hour ago! Been here several times before, on a Saturday morning and it's never been like this. The poor staff seems unorganized and confused. So sad because we really like the food. Don't think I can get my husband to come back"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Cali, and we've been looking for a burger joint like the Norms in Cali. Went here and it reminds me of home! Definitely coming here to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Had to wait 55 minutes for an overcooked burger. horrible service. stunk!!! Should have went to McDonalds."}
{"text":"Have made several return visits and have enjoyed all of them!!! I always get the charburger...usually with cheese and sometimes bacon or habanero.  Duchess here!  So juicy and perfectly combined with toppings. Fries are delicious and hot.  Great crispy skin and slightly soft center.  Great service!  Fast and friendly waitress, cashier, and cooks on tonight's night shift.  I know who everyone comments about regarding \"being rude\"....but if you order properly and don't talk on your phone, you will get the friendly attitude she has greeted me with!"}
{"text":"My family and I were starving so we decided to go to the jims. We've known for the service to be slow and horrible but the food is decent. During our latest visit, it took 35 mins to even get out drinks, not even our food. After another 5 mins of waiting, we received our food. This is the last time I will try Jims."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Staff not so much. It's not something to run home about but it's alright. It's at least good enough for me to return if I don't want to get something from Subway, McDonald's or the like. So on to the food, I've tried the veggie omelette and gyro omelette.  It was simply put ok. Ingredients aren't quality and eggs were on the greasy side.  Think along the lines of diner quality.  The hash browns seemed to be frozen.   I decided to venture out and try the jalapeño burger.  The jalapeños and onions on the burger were grilled. The burger was alright, however it lacked flavor. It was a fatty juicy cheesy patty with melted American cheese.  The fries were not fresh.  I ordered a combo meal with the jalapeño burger. The drink order( dr. Pepper) was flat, lacked carbonation and didn't taste like Dr. Pepper.  If greasy and frozen is what you're looking for,  this is definitely the spot.   Update: I did return to try the chorizo egg burrito.  It was ok.  Chorizo and egg were a little over cooked (dry) but I did like the jalapeño and onions inside the burrito.  It's better than what else is around in the area, however, it's not as good as others that I have tried."}
{"text":"I do love their burgers!Don't substitute something. it makes the lady at the resister mad and ruins her day. I will agree with others that the service Is SO SO- However I love their burgers. So I Still go :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Good service!  If you are new to the Surprise area this place  is a must."}
{"text":"Quickly became a family favorite.  Good food. Friendly staff.  Comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday at 10:11 and waited until 11:56 just get to food (burger and fries). People getting served all around us and there was no organization or sympathy. Won't return or recommend. Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Food is good and reasonable priced but the cashiers have no personality and can't take orders. We have eaten here twice. First experience go to counter to order no greeting from cashier and added chicken nuggets to meal that we never received. Second experience ask for order to go got home and see they forgot an order of fries we placed. Called to let them know and they stated I never ordered them. Clearly we know what we ordered."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our daughter to this place Saturday evening.  It was not very busy, so we thought we would have smooth sailing.  We did not have to wait in line.  We ordered our food, and the first issue that I had was that the cashier did not know how to make change.  A little weird, but whatever.  Then we found a table, and proceeded to wait over 30 minutes for our food!  And no drinks either.  Like I said, it was not busy, and the kitchen had plenty of employees.  So there was no reason for this.  They were very unorganized, and that is something they need to address.  They had a dining room full of unhappy customers, all waiting way too long for their food.  The food itself was nothing spectacular.  Not bad, not great.  We had burgers, fries and onion rings.  The burgers were way smaller than claimed.  The onion rings were almost $5, and we got 6 of them on the plate.   The prices were way too high.  Many of the things served seemed like they were bought from a warehouse retailer, like the buns and the fries.  Not original or special.  This place needs some organization now! And some decor on the walls would be nice. I want it to succeed, because we need more local food joints out here, but this just was not worth it."}
{"text":"The service was terrible...the burgers were ok but if the service is bad that shoots down everything else.  The girl at the counter taking orders seemed like she was in a daze or something.  After we placed our orders we sat down without our drinks I might add waiting, and waiting, then I grabbed a waitress and asked when we were going to get our drinks and a few minutes later she brought out our good but still no drinks, so were sitting there  wondering if they are going to remember to bring the drinks our what...After 5 minutes go by I grabbed the waitress again and she finally brought them to us...why can't you just give out the drinks like everybody else does when a person placed an order...but to make it worse they hide the drink machine behind the court so no one can get to it but them....this place sucks."}
{"text":"I like it here. I enjoy eating my breakfast out on the patio. The food is pretty good. Not the best I've had, but about what you'd expect from a little diner. I usually get the biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns. This is yummy. The servers are usually friendly and pretty good at keeping the coffee cups full."}
{"text":"Generally really good, sometimes the wait is tough though which is why I gave only 4 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, both for breakfast and for dinner.  We've never had bad food or service.  Everything has been as expected.  The burgers are good but a little pricey.  You get your moneys worth for breakfast though.     There's nothing especially notable.  It's your garden variety greasy spoon and there's nothing wrong with that.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This Place!!!! Wife and daughter loves it, I have issues with Jim's Burgers!! First their service is really horrible, especially when they are busy!! So, yesterday I thought I would be on top of this and called my order in. So I ordered their Acapulco chicken, cheeseburger special to go. Had this in the bag!!! She told me it would be ready in 15 mins!! So I arrive their 12 mins later, with a smile on my face ready to pick up our lunch! I get their and they informed me they no longer serve Acapulco Chicken!!!! I pointed to their menu on the wall, and their to go menu. It shows they do!! Then I asked why didn't you call me??? Well, we did! Your phone doesn't work??? I laid my phone down on the counter and asked them to call it!! It was a miracle!!! It worked! Not having the chicken wasn't the reason I was upset! If you come here enough you will realize the waiting time can be long. That's why I called it in, so I can get in and get out! After realizing I was upset, and did not want to wait for about a 1/2 hr! They rushed my order in and I was out of their with in 5-10 minutes! Price is still to high, I'm OK with this place, but since wife and daughter loves this place. I will be coming here more then I would want!!"}
{"text":"went back to this place AGAIN because it was 230-3pm on a Saturday afternoon figured it would be pretty empty which it was. Its the only place in surprise you can get a quick not so much fast food burger. .. so we just ordered 1  burger 1 order fries and 1 order onion rings waited about 30-45 minutes. the food was brought out. i asked for our soda and the ranch i had ordered. she said ok..  our burgers were half gone and still she had not been back . finally went up to the counter the girl was not happy handed me me items. another lady was at the counter too asking for her drink .. they are a busy spot. .. they need figure out how to get people in and out of the place. they would probably make a lot more money... and if they would get some customer service skills it would improve a lot. .. it seems like after all these reviews they just really dont care either..."}
{"text":"The food is okay but service is awful! Can't stand the old lady at the register she always acts so annoyed and she is just straight rude every time we come there. They messed up my order one time and forgot to give me what I ordered and they refused to give me my money back. I will be going somewhere else where they have better food and service!"}
{"text":"This place is very good & clean & service is very nice...they have quick service....we all had different meals and we all enjoyed it... breakfast was good ..burgers were great and I had the Jimmy Philly and that was awesome...I will be back for sure  every time I come up here and visit.."}
{"text":"The burgers here are always excellent. Service is okay but at least the main cashier wasn't here because she is always rude to who ever I'm with.  If you don't mind great food and alright service the come here. Best burgers in Arizona in my opinion."}
{"text":"The lady at the counter was incredibly rude to my husband & I when we walked up to the counter... She was SO rude, in fact to the point where we said \"nevermind\" to our order and walked out!!! HORRIBLE RUDE SERVICE!!! We will NEVER go there again and will warn all of our friends in the area not to eat there! We heard it was bad from many others but now we know it's true! Hopefully they will go out of business and it will become something more useful like a Starbucks instead!!!"}
{"text":"Watched somebody behind the counter cutting food, wipe the knife on the edge of the garbage can then continue cutting. I mentioned to the owner taking my order and she didn't seem to care. Won't go back!  Update. Tried again after a couple year break. Good food but still terrible service! I don't know how this place stays open. There won't be another try."}
{"text":"Jim's Burger's & Egg's  The food is decent, not the best I've ever had by any means but for the price it's decent. Their breakfast is pretty pedestrian. The Pastrami Burger, might be something to call home about actually.   That being said, then it comes down to the service. As other people have posted on here, it just isn't that great. There are two people usually taking orders, the girl with the curly hair, who is really a nice girl... then there is the heavier set lady, and she doesn't ever seem to be happy, and is always miserable.   Then there is the big shot Jim, he walks around once in a while, but never says anything to the customer's. If you are going to run a successful business and your face is going to be logo, and your name is in the title, you have to have some customer service skills, and he appears to not have any.   I would eat here again, by doing a phone order, but I don't like going in and sitting down, as the staff makes the environment not an enjoyable place to eat a meal."}
{"text":"Glad this place is here. Beats the fast food places around here. Nice people and I always get good service. The bacon egg cheeseburger is my favorite. Breakfast is great as well.  Being that they're Greek, my only complaint would be the gyros sandwich. I think they use some kinda tartar sauce instead of tzatski. It's easy guys.. Some yogurt, cucumber, garlic and a little dill. The meat is great though. Thanks! :)"}
{"text":"When I crave a California style burger, this is the spot. Everything I've tried here is full of flavor. I did see an interaction between a Middle Aged woman at the cashier counter with one of the younger female employees where the older woman, I'm assuming is one of the owners of the place, and she was pretty nasty. I'm just saying that makes for an unhappy place to work, and this could be a fun first work experience for someone."}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times and go for their delicious zucchini, we've always gone in to eat but since the last few times that we've been there the girls at the registers and the ones that bring the food to the tables have been very pushy and rude. Forgot our drinks, messed up our order, and kept coming to our table & taking items off the table to fill or our plates when we weren't done with them. Had them keep coming up to our table asking if we needed boxes and felt as though they were trying to rush us out. They close at 9 and was there about 7:45-8:30. If we choose to go back it will be for take out."}
{"text":"We went here on Sunday based on local recommendations  It was the worst dining experience in many years.  It took more than an hour to get served our order of omelets after we waited to find a table.There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of wait .  Place was full of people waiting this long.  They take your money up front, so you are less inclined to leave.  The order staff could have at least advised customers of the excessive wait times.  When the order did arrive I would rate mediocre. Cold toast , tasteless omelette , not memorable or worth recommendation.  I would not go back or recommend to anyone.  No stars."}
{"text":"Great food, really authentic chorizo burrito and their breakfast burrito is the best!"}
{"text":"It requires a star...otherwise I'd give it an F ! It was our 1st time there this past Friday, 1st impression? No thanks, never again. Horrible horrible service from cashier Maria. (No name tags, had to ask the girl who brought our food out). Barely moved her lips, wouldnt looked up, appeared bothered and inconvenienced by new customer questions. Her personality killed the whole experience. And it's not an over exaggeration...we were seated in a place where we could see her.. nasty to all that came to the counter. She needs to be kept in the back cleaning the floor or something. The food was 'okay', maybe a 2.5 stars. Bad service leaves a bad taste."}
{"text":"The food is okay. It's not the worst I have had or the best but the reason for the 1 star is the rudeness you have to experience when eating there. The lady at the front counter is rude and often talks down to you, if you don't know the menu or what you want. The last time I went the service was extremely slow and no one ever really checked on you. I would say avoid unless you enjoy rudeness, and slow service for subpar food."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm impressed! I forgot to take a pic of my food, already ate my burger :) I ordered a burger combo. Hefty portions for the burger, fries, and the drink (32 oz). We will be coming back to try more of the menu. Great diner here in Surprise! Got to meet Jim himself, he's so nice!"}
{"text":"Jim's burgers is sooo good. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner... so good. They make yummy veggie burgers and fried mushroom and zucchini good. Their iced coffee is also very good. Love this place."}
{"text":"I am really shaken up. I don't like rating anything bad but what I experienced was so beyond horrible.  I placed an order over the phone for pick up. After I waited in line to pay for it I was standing near the counter to pick up my food when a heavy older lady behind the counter goes \"stand back the waitress needs to come\" - now I want you all to know that's the exact way she said it   So I stood back and a waitress comes from behind me and walks into me hard bumping into me and doesn't say sorry or anything so I let it go... a couple mins the heavy lady looks at me and said \"ma'am get your food\".. I asked for my drink since it was missing.. and told her what it was.. I then told her that she didn't have to talk to me that way that I even got bumped by the waitress. She then yells at me telling me I was on my phone (I actually was just looking at the time to see how long I've been waiting). She literally almost threw the drink in my face. I asked her for her name Please and she goes \"George Washington.. and don't ever come back here again!\"  Folks, I was trying my hardest to be nice and this is how I get treated.   I've never done this before but I'm going to make a complaint with the better business bureau. No one should ever get talked to let alone walked into (by waitress hard) when all you're trying to do is get a nice meal. You"}
{"text":"So a couple of friends and I decided to give this place a shot based on a friends recommendation, only to find out that he had never even had a burger there.   The price and size were about right for what you get, but the was just no WOW factor. The double cheeseburger was good and cooked well. The frys were a bit soft and not all that great. The onion rings were ok, but again nothing special.  There was a little bit of a wait to get our food, but at least the restaurant its self was clean and the overall service was good. I have no real complaints, however there are just better burger joints around that have more to offer."}
{"text":"Great place, we've been driving by this place for a couple years now and finally stopped to see what we've been missing. For starters it is a little different in that you wait in line at first and then you order. You grab a menu and browse selections while you wait. Could be 2 minutes could be 20 mins, just depends on your luck and the length of the line. We we're first or otherwise I may have turned around and found a more traditional experience. I had an incredible Denver Omelett with Pancakes Toast and Hash Browns. It came out quickly. Large meal plenty to eat and priced right. Could definately be 4 stars but waiting in line while you could be sitting down drinking coffee while you wait for your meal took off a star. The staff is so very friendly. This would be an excellent idea for take out the way it is structured"}
{"text":"My husband is from Los Angeles, and if your from there or have been their you know of Tom's. They have all sorts of crazy burgers and chilly cheese fries. For the longest we couldn't really find anywhere near us where we could find such thing other than Wendy's. Until one of our friends told us about Jim's he talked about how great it was.So we decided to give it a try.   The food was good we had a regular Bacon cheese burger, and an order of Pastrami Chili Cheese fries which were AWESOME! We came to find out by one of the girls that works that the business actually does come from California.   The restaurant when you walk in is clean, and kind of busy we went on a Sunday around 1Pm can't imagine going when people are out of Church, but that not my point. I had seen some reviews talking about the the owner \"Jim?\" is rude. She was nice when we went to order, but from the looks of it she's not so nice to some of her employees.  We will be returning until we find something better, until then I'll make sure to treat the employees extra nice so that they don't mind so much having to be there. I mean their isn't that many places for teenagers to find work in Suprise is there?"}
{"text":"One star because I can't put none. Food smells weird, the owner is really rude. She makes you feel stupid for ordering. Feel really bad for the servers. They get 5 stars:) the owner probably beats them. Oh and she doesn't have sour cream(SMH)."}
{"text":"The family loves this place! We enjoy a great hearty meal each time. Its great to see small business owners doing good in your area, they know us each time we go in there. It's sad to see some people ( MARK ) writing such hateful things on here. Opinions and reviews are always welcome to SB owners, but it should be expressed with proper manners and respect! We will continue to dine here often. Keep up the hard work Jim's!"}
{"text":"Intro-Sincerely, I will not be to this business again.  PROS- Good fries, good selection of drinks. Has a television set.  CONS- I asked for a chili burger, no cheese, no mayonnaise. Guess what happened? I got it slopped with mayonnaise, but there was no cheese. My mother got a stack of waffles. I sampled some myself, they were cold. Father got a cola and a quarter-pounder. He said the burger was cold and it was very similar to my despair.  Overall- I see little good in this place. I would recommend this to the less-picky kind of people. If you order it, it will be pretty much the opposite of what you get. If you do like sports, and a large selection of Greek food, be my guest and go to there :) The food looks really appetizing, and service was good."}
{"text":"Several weeks ago my wife and I decided to try Jim's Burgers and Eggs on a Sunday evening because we had heard about it and their website indicated the place is open until 7 p.m.  Not!  We got there at about 5:30 p.m. only to find it was closed.  Turns out they close at 3 p.m. on Sundays.  Might want to change the website because people really do read that stuff.  Even though I read many negative reviews we decided we would still give the place a chance and we made the 15 minute drive again today to try Jim's.  Big mistake.  The place was very busy and crowded which didn't bother us.  The lady behind the counter was not the terror we had read about but she wasn't Miss Congeniality either.  I ordered an egg burger and fries and my wife ordered a cheeseburger.  The lady who took our order lamented that they are really busy on the weekends and can't keep up and I got the impression she was telling us we would be better off not coming on a weekend.  Interesting.  Forty five minutes later our food arrived.   My burger was cooked to the consistency of a hockey puck.  The burger was small but the bun was very larger.  The bun was toasted which was nice but the burger was not good at all and I don't like getting a massive piece of bread with a small piece of meat.  My wife's cheeseburger was cooked the same way.  On top of that she had a critter in her burger.  It was already dead but was in her burger.  Nice.    Now I understand the negative reviews this place has received as they are deserved.  We will certainly not be back."}
{"text":"Had a chorizo and egg burrito. It was actually really good!! A little pricey but I would go back."}
{"text":"We have been here a lot because the food is great! The service from the attitude when you order to the mass chaos to get your food. God forbid you ask for silverware when they never gave you any. The cooks should stay and then clean house of everyone else. This would be a 5 star dinner if they could just get rid of the horrible staff."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!!! I cannot say enough about Jim's. We live close so this is a great go to. I love their burgers, their patty melt is to die for, the Ruben is piled high with mouth watering meat and kraut. My kids love the burgers, grilled cheese and fries. I've also had their pancakes, country fried steak and eggs and pastrami omelet! I've NEVER had a bad meal here. The place is clean, well kept and the staff is kind and helpful. I hope they stay around, I don't see how they couldn't since they are always busy. Eat on, my friends, eat on!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Saturday. Extremely slow service on ordering. The old lady was very rude when we ordered. Ordered two breakfast omlette's on the same order with toast. Toast was barley toasted and one omlette came out with a bunch of cheese then the other came out with two shreds of cheese and was over cooked. It wasn't even worth bringing back if I had to put up with ladies attitude again.  Started eating it and it had egg shells in it. I will never eat at this place again. Good luck"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I am not a fan of the counter service, my family all received their food about over a 7 minute span with the kids getting their food last. All very forgivable except for the lady, who I think was the owner getting completely annoyed for asking her recommendations because it was our first time there. In the middle of taking our order she was reprimanding employees. Maybe we will try it but not likely because we felt so unwelcome."}
{"text":"The food here is great and I definitely recommend the food itself, HOWEVER the woman at the front at the register taking the order is EXTREMELY rude! After reading all the reviews I wonder why the company would allow her to continue interacting with customers! I mean, she's the first person everyone interacts with. Had I not been with family I would have walked out and not even ordered. Her alone, is the reason why I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"My family & I came in for breakfast before a long moving day. My uncle & I have never been here before but my parents have. We went to the side to look over the menu & the tall lady with short hair & an accent rushed us to take our order. Not even 5 minutes walking in the door. Very rude & insisted to take our order & we werent ready. The rushing attitude was very disrespectful & the attitude she gave my dad, we were being so rush my dad started getting confused .. There was not customers behind us at all. We sat down to wait for our meal & my uncles order was incorrect & it immediately felt like it was our fault. I noticed that every other customer that came in and the lady was much nicer to everyobe else. A group came in to look over the menu just like we did and she had no problems conversating & letting them take their time. Even with a line this time. I wouldnt come back for the serivce. The food was good. Sausage wasnt too salty & had a good crunch. My veggie omelette interestingly had the cheese on top.  Although we come into a restaurant for the food. The service should never be ignored. We dont want to come into any place with kindness. Thank you for your service."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you like to wait a long time for sub-par, over priced food. Went there on a Saturday before a tball game and we had to leave without our food because it took over 25 minutes to get our for for 2 people. They brag about have Greek cooks, but their gyro meat is just preformed strips of meat instead of team authentic shaved meat. A decent restaurant serving similar food in this area would put them out of business."}
{"text":"I am new to the Surprise dining scene. This place wouldn't last a week in central Phoenix or even Glendale. I heard life us slower paced way out west but over an hour for French Toast, an egg, and an omlette? Puh -Leeze ! The food was nothing to write home about, nothing bad, just meh.   This place is dead to me."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I dont know who the owner is but it might have been who I was dealing with.  I will never set food in this place again.  Staff is unbelievably rude. I have never been treated so badly.  I was in shock.  Asked for a full refund and left.  Too bad because the food is decent."}
{"text":"This place is fast and seems like a happening little lunch spot for people who work nearby. I got the veggie omelette and it was delicious. The cheese on top was amazing. My husband seemed to like his Denver omelette. All in all a pretty good lunch spot. Our server was sweet but the register lady was pretty rude. Four stars bc it wasn't even busy and she was clearly annoyed that we had never been there and had a few questions."}
{"text":"The food was average at best but the heavy set Caucasian lady has the worst attitude ever.   I will not return again."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. The food speaks for it self. Everyone I know enjoys the food. The service will come in time. You can't be mad at the food."}
{"text":"As many others have said, the woman who works at the register is the most unpleasant, unprofessional woman I have ever interacted with in my life. I work at a business close by and there are 150 other people who also work here. We have almost all eaten at Jim's and almost all of us won't go back because of how terribly we were treated by this woman. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, especially at a hole in the wall place like this, but I do expect to be treated with decency when I'm spending my money there. The food is good, but in my opinion, nothing is worth being treated with such disrespect."}
{"text":"Loved this little diner. The food was quick and the service was fast and furious  there were four of us. 2 omlets, a gyro, and a burger. Everything was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the seating is very limited. It's almost a free for all when it comes to finding a table. No matter what time of the day we come on the weekends, it is busy with a line. I'll come back on a different day during the week and see if it's the same. Food will always be good! Update....... It has been an hour and we still haven't received our food. Don't come here if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Out of town visitors and we stopped for lunch.  My wife and I along with her niece at 12:00.  We had a hamburger, onion rings with tea -- a Cobb salad with tea and a chili dog with a Pepsi to eat at the restaurant.  The \"waitress\" .... Sigh.   She brought me my hamburger.  That's it.  Then she brought the Pepsi.   Then she brought the salad and chili dog.  Then she brought two iced teas.  Then I had to ask for silverware -- you would have thought I had asked for a new car with her very poor attitude.  I asked about my onion rings -- nothing.  I waited 15 more minutes -- nothing.  I then went inside and spoke directly with Jim who made me a fresh order in less than two minutes.     The \"waitress\" needs a MAJOR attitude adjustment -- not to mention a tray to hold an entire order.  The current system of filling an order is a joke.  On the plus side, the food -- as it arrived piece by piece -- was very good."}
{"text":"I had a burger this time...still not impressed.  It was a basic burger with letuce, tomato, onion, pickle and dressing.  The bun is super soft but not toasted so it fell apart after the second bite.    The service is still as crappy and rude as before.  Food was brought out with no silverware, no syrup, and had to ask to get the drink we ordered.    We sat outside because it was a beautiful day.  It looks like they clean the outside tables about as often as they clean the ketchup and mustard containers.....never.  The tabkes are disgusting and dirty so we had flys buzzing around us all through our meal.     With all the good mom and pop places that haven't made it, it pisses me off a little that this place gets so much action.  I won't be back.  This place proves how desparate Surprise is for a good breakfast place."}
{"text":"My family and I love the food at this place but the service leaves you a little disappointed. The ladies that greetyou could be a little more nice."}
{"text":"Heads up!! The breakfast sandwiches come with thousand island style dressing!! I wasn't asked if I wanted it, and I NEVER would assume a breakfast sandwich to have that kind of dressing, so if you don't want it make sure you tell them!!   I had never had a breakfast sandwich with dressing like that on it, but it strangely worked. I was craving a tomato on my egg, bacon and cheese sandwich, so it kinda did that flavor for me.  My husband hated the dressing though, so if you aren't into it, make sure you let them know!    I like the way Jim puts the sandwich together and its huge, so I am sticking with four stars, but I was somewhat frustrated when we were half a mile down the road with the take out and found the dressing, and my hubby had to eat it anyway cuz we were on the run...   I know I am reaching for this place, but for some reason, I want to see it work. Again, the negative reviews make a lot of sense and seem true to me, but so far I am satisfied..."}
{"text":"Food is always great! But this lady behind the counter is something else! I know we go here for the food but in this kind of business, great customer service skills is very important too. This lady has no customer service skills at all!"}
{"text":"Second day in a row, wow can't beat the 3eggs,4 bacon & hash browns, leaving the area for the summer can't wait to get back, $7.95 thanks for a great breakfast"}
{"text":"Meh...  Not sure what to think of this place, the wife and I decided to try it out in favor of trying some new surprise restaurants.  You walk in there appear to be servers, with a seat yourself vibe because there is no sign that says otherwise.  We sit down and a few min later one of the \"servers\" comes over and tells us that we order at the counter and they bring us the food, ok, change \"servers\" to \"runners\" no big deal moving on. I noticed once we were seated another family came in and same episode repeated, nothing wrong with the counter approach, just some signage would be good.  I'd been craving a pastrami burger and one of the reason I came was to try their pastrami burger. I order the pastrami burger, the wife orders a pastami sandwich and we split an order of chili cheese fries. I ask for them to add Swiss to her pastrami sandwich, \"we don't have swiss\" only american, ok no cheese. apparently the only cheese they have is american, later I started going over the menu contemplating how many items would be better with Swiss.  we get the food at the table and it looks good, the runner was friendly and asked if we needed anything else.  My burger is well cooked, looks good and fresh, the taste is mediocre, nothing wrong, but nothing standing out the pastrami seems bland in comparison to some others, a bit too salty as well.  The fries were crispy which is a big plus, the chili was pretty good as well  My didn't even eat half of her sandwich I could tell these some thing off-putting about it.  All in all a good meal, but not for foodies, perfectly prepared fresh, pedestrian food in my opinion.  still I want to like this place because it has a lot of potential, maybe if I come back you'll wow me with the \"eggs\"  and please get the swiss situation under control it's delicious."}
{"text":"We were out looking for a new place to eat and came across this place. We thought we would give it a try. We are glad we did! They have a great selection of menu items.  I had the Cobb salad and my husband had the gyro. The girls had chili and a cheese burger with fries. Then we added on chili cheese fries. That was the big hot with the kids. I would recommend this place. Try it out sometime!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast spot as IHOP is old news...I decided I was going to try this place being that it was 5 mins from my house and I see it all the time shopping at Frys...I walked in excited to see all the options, wanted to try their burgers but figured I would come another day when it was lunch time, welp that day will never come. The first thing I noticed was it was highly overpriced seeing how Waffle House does a better job then they do at breakfast, now to get to the actual breakfast part you could literally make this meal at home. Nothing special whatsoever, plus the hashbrowns absolutely disgusted me, maybe too greasy I'm not sure, all I know is ketchup couldn't even help that mess. I would definitely not recommend this place, I will stick with making meals at home."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Food was good, and prices are very reasonable. Staff,  especially the lady who took our order was really helpful. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Staff was helpful and answered all of our questions.  They were very nice.  My wife got a HUGE grilled chicken salad and she could not finish it.  She even had chicken left over!  Imagine that with a salad from one of the chains!  I actually had breakfast for dinner (3 eggs and hash browns and was satisfied).  They know what \"over-medium\" means  Boys both liked their hamburgers.  We will return..."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today at Jim's.  About half the tables were taken, so busy but not packed.  We ordered a couple burgers and drinks.  We took out table and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  There was a table of 6 next to us and I was amazed how their order was delivered one burger at a time, about 5 minutes apart.  And we waited.  It took 33 minutes to get 2 regular burgers and 2 drinks. Not even offered our drinks while we waited, no updates on the status of our order.  There were 7 people working around the grill... it was crazy.  I could have gotten a better burger at Red Robin or other restaurants in half the time.  Really too bad, we could use a good cafe on the west side.    Pros:  Good location             Staff was reasonably friendly             Prices were not out of line             Sizable menu (in fact, probably too large or ambitious)  Cons: Amazingly disorganized kitchen             No Coke or Dr. Pepper. I was amazed now many people in line               asked for both, but got neither.             No place to wait for take out orders   Overall, give it a pass. At least for now.  Hopefully at some point, they will get their act together."}
{"text":"Its a mom and pop burger joint been eating here for the past 4 years alittle pricey but what do you want for the only mom and pop burger place in the area. Ive had nearly everthing on the menu and its great. P.S. Theres to many complainers dont pay any attention to the whinners."}
{"text":"Never again! 2nd time eating there and I had food poisoning. I tried the chicken gyro and was sick for two days.. When I tried to call the girl laughed and hung up on me. Trust me, I didn't want anything I just wanted to make sure you gave the info to see if it was old meat!"}
{"text":"This was my first and simply my last time here.    Decent place but the employee attitude around here sucks! I simply asked the cashier how big the portion size is,  simply cause I eat a lot.  She looked at me like I was stupid for asking such a question,  and said the picture is right there of what you ordered.  Didn't even answer my question.  Asked for a large orange juice,  we get a small little cup.  Waitress said it's only one size for the orange juice.  Which was not brought to our attention but the cashier who has an attitude problem.    So my wife had to stand in line once again just for a large drink.   Food is ok. But attitude here is very poor.  Makes me feel uncomfortable.  Don't think I'd be back again."}
{"text":"Concept is good. Service is not so friendly at least when placing the order. Short matter of fact don't ask me any questions place your order \"NEXT!!\" They really hyped their burgers and I found them less than desire able.  I ordered the cheeseburger meal combo. My burger was overcooked, thin, dry and buried somewhere underneath a pound of lettuce. The french fries were over cooked and slightly cold but on the positive side the bun was fresh. No one checks back to see how your food was or whether you need any refills so after you get your food you're on your own! Overall my experience was meh. Hopefully I just caught them on a bad day as I can see where this restaurant would have potential with the right management and more attention to food preparation."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries were good but the workers were rude ...probably won't be back too far of a drive to be treated poorly"}
{"text":"Me and my friend stop by to get some lunch and to try their food for the first time. Driving all the way from LA cali and back, we experienced the very worst customer service referring to this cashier personnel (Frida or something)  that actually lied to me about it since i asked her name coz i was so pissed the way she's giving us sarcastic and unprofessional way of treating customers especially FIRST TIMERS. My friend heard to somebody that they serve rib-eye steak coz it's one of their specials, so when he ordered to this rude lady about it, she rudely told my friend \"Honey we don't serve steaks in here, we offer burgers fries and some other things but not steaks\"(On a high tone) with all this people around waiting at the back.  So i had to tell her \"sorry coz it's our first time dining here,we're from California so we're not really sure what to order\" and she replied \"well I'm from California too\". On my situation,  i ordered pork chop with eggs and hash brown plus onion rings. While waiting to pay for it. I saw some other order coming out from the kitchen infront of me similar to my order but with gravy sauce on it, so i asked her \"am i gonna get gravy sauce on my pork chops too?\" then she told me, \"No, amount said, you have to pay extras here\" So i have to tell her sorry that's why i asked, that was a question.  And she now told me \" so you want to cancel your order?....  What about the onion rings? Are you still getting it? I was like what?!? Of course. Now she said\" coz you already have hash browns, I'm like so???\" and even asked me \" do you know onion rings? \" My order on the menu without onion rings and soda is around $10 plus and my bill came out $19 plus,  so i just asked her \"isn't it 10 plus for my meal?\" and she replied \" yeah plus the rings you added plus the drink and tax\" (in unprofessional way of talking to a customer)  i got so pissed talking to her and even looking at her face, i just said whatever just take my card. Before i leave the counter i had toask her name thinking to report her to the owner or management or somebody about her inappropriate and unprofessional way of treating customers especially FIRST TIMERS. She even changed her name to \"George\" knowing it's \"Frida or something(fat lady)\"  from her co-worker, coz i had a feeling she didn't give me her real name. So upset and pissed it ruined my lunch and mood, plus seeing her talking to her other co-workers and i think the owner(old guy),( surely telling them different scenario)    Now about the food, i wouldn't say i was only on a very bad mood but it's like eating in Denny's but worst (No taste at all) i even let my friend try the pork chop and he spit it out.   Whoever owns this place or managing it, make sure you don't have this type of employee or at least train them again. This is just bad for business.  Never coming back    (maybe that's the reason why you said you're also from cali. but working in Arizona, as a cashier)  coz you'll never survive in Cali with that attitude towards customers.   (Negative star)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great burger joint with monstrous portions, that also serves amazing breakfast-this is your place! The food is classic, stick to your sides, comfort food but not in the fatty, greasy way. The burger patties might be thin but their huge and cooked to perfection. Nothing is overdone on this menu-just simple, wholesome ingredients combined to make your mouth water the moment your plate hits the table. You can't help but dive in! It's counter service with lots of different seating options including tables outside. And if it's any constellation my parents love this place"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! It's not gourmet but just some quality diner style burgers and breakfasts. What brings down the rating is the service. I think they try but the system they have for ordering is flawed. You order at the counter and take a number and sit down. This leads to lot of mistakes because the servers have no idea what you ordered and have to rely on the ticket which is in the kitchen. Last time I went we had been sitting for ten minutes before they even brought us our drinks not to mention my order being totally wrong. My rating would go up 2 more stars if they would just switch to the traditional waiter/waitress model. You know why so many restaurants use that model??? Because it works!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time visit here at Jim's Burgers and Eggs and will most likely will be my last. Coming in high spirited on a Sunday morning to be treated like dirt by the older woman with short curly hair who wears glasses. This woman took my and my family's order like if we were illiterate. Even after letting her know this was our first visit here and apologizing for the wait she ends up scuffing at us and responds with \"it's really easy to order, look and the menu and repeat what you want out loud\" I mean who wants to be treated this way? We are paying customers whom still managed to be very polite after being treated so unworthy. My spirits are down and now I cannot even enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"I was in Surprise and was starving so I decided to give this place a shot. The first thing I noticed was that the people working there weren't the friendliest. One instance was when I asked for ketchup with my to-go order came out. The lady snaps back at me that there was ketchup in my bag. I get to my car to find one measly ketchup container...who skimps on ketchup? The food was alright. I ordered the Mexican omelet which was pretty tasty, except that fact that one of the main ingredients was bacon, and I found 3 chuncks of bacon in the entire omlete! Seriously! Hash browns were mushy. Wouldnt come back because of unfriendly service and them being skimpy."}
{"text":"Horrible service,  they're always so rude! I won't be returning here and suggest you don't go either. Negative stars if I can give that."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. The breakfast is ok, but it's hard to screw up eggs. I ordered a prime rib sandwich. It was more of a slab of fat than meat. It hurts me not to be able to give them a good review. There's not many non franchise choices in surprise, and as a mom and pop business operation I really want them to do well. But their product is food and the food is not worth the effort to park and walk in. Sorry"}
{"text":"Do not confuse the 5 stars for fine dining. You won't get that here. What you WILL get is really yummy food and great service in a clean environment. It's burgers (and sandwiches) and eggs people! I ordered a pastrami sandwich meal. Yeah, it cost around $10 but I took half my sandwich home and my kids ate half my fries AND I walked away stuffed! My 10 and 12-year old split the French toast deluxe and could barely finish it. I admit, I tried the French toast, covered in butter and cinnamon sugar and it was very tasty. All the people I encountered were super nice and helpful. I cannot believe that I've been this close to such awesome food and haven't been there before. I will be making this my go-to place when I need quality comfort food in a hurry!"}
{"text":"I give 2 stars only because the food is pretty good. The rest is horrible because of the owner which is always there taking orders and she lets each & every customer get to see the mean, rude person she is.  I can't believe how she treats customers!!! And she treats her staff even worse....so of course it's a revolving door over there....always new employees because of her horrible beastly personality & lack of respect for people."}
{"text":"Poorest and slowest service ever! We purchased our breakfast at 9:11 am. Nearly 45 minutes later we still did not have our beverages. Waitresses walked around with people's food aimlessly searching for the correct numbers on the tables.   The sad thing is the food is actually good but the customer service is so horrendous not only will we never return but we will urge others not to waste their time."}
{"text":"Good burgers, but the breakfast? Be still my heart...French toast is drive-worthy. One star removed for waiting 35 min. for breakfast.  Staff was hopping, I think they were just short-staffed."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here several times and have never had bad food.  If you are not in a hurry, weekend morning breakfast is great here but it's always packed so it takes longer than normal. I love their California omelette. Coffee is good and hot.  Their burgers are great and full of flavor. Even the battered mushrooms are delicious. The Cobb salad is large and loaded too. Wish they had more shake flavors other than the date shake, which is surprisingly wonderful. It's a good thing they don't though because I would probably drink them."}
{"text":"They are so rude here. Live within walking distance so we have really tried to give this place a fair try. But every time we've gone it's been horrible. We call in our order and pick it up. The girl is always so rude on the phone and she never gives a time frame as to when you should come pick up your order. When we ask her she just hangs up. The food is average to poor and not at all worth the cost. Tonight when we arrived to pick up our food they hadn't even started on it. Ordered pancakes which actually bent one of our forks and they forgot a portion of our order. It doesn't matter how close they are we are done with this awful place."}
{"text":"1 out of 5 stars. I couldnt hear what she wqs saying .. and thr iwner said maybe i should quit talking so much then maybe I would hear. I have a hearing disability. Im a customer. Shes serving me . Her comments about my hearing or communication issues are not HER concern. I feel disrespected and I'm never coming back here. I'm also a yelp reviewer and I gave her restaurant 1 star. Yelp can be read all over the world. Congratulations your an idiot in over 50 languages."}
{"text":"First time at Jim's and went for dinner.   We both had burgers and they were great but they were out of blue cheese for one of our first pics so went with the double burger instead.  Chili cheese fries were excellent and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger with extra tomato and pickle. I got neither. Flavor of meat was good and asked for well done and I did get that. Asked for extra crispy fries did not get that. They were hot and fresh but not extra crispy. I have a nuwave and was able to make them my way. Thank you"}
{"text":"Came tonight for dinner and it was great! We got the patty melt, chili dog, a bacon cheeseburger burger, fries and fried zucchini. Coming from SoCal where there's mom& pop burger joints on every corner it's great to find this little treasure in Surprise! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The Team at Sweettouch Carpet Cleaning loves Jims. Great hamburgers and fries."}
{"text":"This was our first visit since moving here last July. We ordered the Avocado Bacon Burger and Hawaiian Burger combo's. They were amazing! Great food. Will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"After reading reviews I was about to not visit this place but decided I would because it's so close to where we are staying.   Great food great service reasonable prices.        We had steak and eggs pork chops and eggs and also the burger patty and eggs   The pork and the steak were awesome the coffe was really good too.   The burger patty was a little dry but flavorful.       Would recommend it's miles better than a Denny's or village inn."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. My fiancé and I have been here two times... First the worst, second the best? Not in our case. The first time we went food was good, but the service sucked. Second time. Oh boy. First, the lady who takes your order was extremely rude and b.. You know the word.   So we get our food ordered and go outside on the patio, where most of their customers were. 10minutes goes by and we haven't even gotten our drink yet. Then, our food comes out...still no drink. When we ask the waitress she says \"it's on the way\". Meanwhile looking inside on the counter, there our drinks sit. The couple we went with then got their food, and still no drink. It took my fiancé getting up and going inside to get them himself.   Ready for the best part? The couple we went with, the girl ordered polish sausage. 5 minutes after the food was delivered to our table the waitress comes up to her and says \"I gave you the wrong plate, did you eat off it yet?\" She says no, so the waitress picks up her plate and walks it over to the table it belonged to. REALLY?!? That is a health code violation x10! At that point, I was pissed. Even scared to eat my own food.   After everyone is about done, my fiancé goes to eat his toast. One bite he spits it back out. Why? Because there was raw egg yolk on it.   We will never return to this disgusting so called restaurant. I was very disappointed because we like to support family owned, non chain businesses. Looks like this is one business that we WILL NOT support."}
{"text":"Love having a great breakfast place right in our neighborhood.  Never had a bad breakfast here...wow are the drinks huge!"}
{"text":"Jims Burger and Egg, spectacular Burger!  The breakfasts looked great, but would be hard to come here and not have one of these burgers, Cant wait to be back"}
{"text":"WHY!?!?!?! Is it so hard to have a restaurant with a good wait staff. My wife and I were in the area going to a pizza place when I saw this and said lets go here instead. We order our food and grab a table and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally I see our food coming out. The waitress they have here is one of the worst I have seen. No smile. No your welcome when we say thank you. Just puts the plates down and walks off. For me atleast a good staff is alot to restaurant, but the food has to be good to which this wasnt. Now they have alot on there menu so who knows how the rest is I can only go off what I ordered. I got a pastrami burger and my wife got a regular burger. I didnt eat half of mine. Just because you put 2 slices of pastrami on a regular burger doesnt make it any differnt! I have had alot better ones at other places so I have many to compare it to. I ask my wife how her burger is and she said it was nothing really. No taste no nothing. Like going to Red Robin. If the owners read this please fire you daughter cause thats has to be the only reason she still has the job. Hire a better waitress. And dont waist your time people. Let it close and somthing better move in."}
{"text":"Great food but a really long wait time when I was there around 1pm.  The girl that took my order was accommodating and customized it a bit for me, which I appreciated.  The bacon, egg and cheese on toast is delicious!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food has always been great!! Other reviews mention the lady at the register. I have not had any issues with her but I usually know what I want before I order. I have witnessed her become impatient when asked questions about the menu. I have called a couple of times to place a pick up order and usually get put on hold, which is fine they are busy, but 50% of the time I get hung up on after being put on hold. Not instead of getting put on hold but they answer, ask me to hold, and then 30-45 seconds later just hang up the phone. I would rather they just not answer the phone if they are busy or else have whoever answers the phone be ready to take an order."}
{"text":"If this was just based on the food it would rate 3.5 to 4 stars. Placed our order for 3 Burgers, 3 drinks and a order of fried zucchini and fried mushrooms. The girl taking our order forgot to charge us for the drinks so she had to run a 2nd transaction as we thought we were about to have a seat. She was nice about it once she figured out what had happened. Once our burgers arrived (ordered Avocado Burger, Mushroom Swiss and Double Cheese) the Avocado burger had no avocado on it. She told the cooks and it took a little bit for the Avocado to come out on a seperate plate. I didn't really care for the lettuce that was used on the burgers, but I rarely find that. Everything else was good with the food. Ok, now that the negative is out of the way, the positive. The fried mushrooms and fried zucchini were the best I have had in a long time. They don't cut the zucchini in little rounds but into spears and serve both with ranch dressing. I would return just to enjoy these items again. The rest of the staff in the place seemed really nice and were cleaning up from a lunch crowd when we came in. Aside from the few mistakes I could really say the food was worth trying."}
{"text":"Ate there for breakfast.  People were friendly and very helpful.  Food was great."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! The breakfast burrito is the way to go. The price is right for what you get. It is a small local restaurant but they are always busy."}
{"text":"Spot on. Good solid food (breakfast burrito and 3 eggs), good table service, easy and fast ordering. Happy Days. Oh, and the salsa is fabulous."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch and were surprised by how busy this place was on a Saturday. Half of our group got breakfast and the other half got lunch and everyone was happy! The portions were great. The only issue was the lack of flavor in the french fries they were not good at all, really bland and plain. I loved the pastrami burger, it was delicious and I would totally go back and get it again!"}
{"text":"Like every other review on here, the rude lady is the reason why I will not be returning to his place ever again! Horrible attitude and customer service. I couldn't believe what I witnessed when she started going off on her employee in front of the customers. Aside from the customer service you won't find here, they have yet to get my order correct! Their breakfast burrito is a disappointment. Chili meat. Gross. If you want a decent breakfast go to Nick's! Oh and their burgers suck too!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and lunch! Had a garden burger ( huge size) and huge onion rings. Would definitely come again! Old fashioned diner set up."}
{"text":"Well I have to give credit where credit is due... My parents are new to the area and wanted to try this place out. I warned them that the lady at the counter may be too much to handle. However, we walked in and she was surprisingly polite, even greeted us. It was night and day compared to my first visit. The food came out immediately and was delicious with huge portions. I'm glad I went back and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I typically don't leave crappy post, but this one is a must. I typically enjoy eating at local Mom and pop shops and thoroughly enjoy boosting the local economy. However, this place was a true disappointment. From the beginning this gave me a horrible impression. The cashier ignored us and would rather have a personal conversation. Additionally, my mother was a regular here and the lady couldn't recognize her until she reminded here who she was......Secondly, my mother was served almost immediately and my order was given to someone else. As we looked around, I began to notice several people received their orders---yes they fit the mold of a customer base they would rather serve...(it's my impression of it anyway). The waitress asked , \"oh you didn't get your Greek?\" I am thinking... you are the only waitress here.... you know you didn't serve me what I ordered. When we asked her what happened, she basically stated she gave my order to another person, because she thought they made two...... I chose not to eat my food because of my impression of how they treated me. I explained I was not eating and they chose to ignore me. Okay, looks look  you no longer want my business either... I will not be coming back! I am so disappointed in this crappy place..."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the customer service was atrocious.  The $1 tip was too much.   Our waitress was blonde, mid twenties chick. She had quite the attitude with everyone in our party. They didn't want to bring our drinks. They messed up one order and then blamed us for it being wrong and we had to pay at the table. I had to ask for silverware. How is someone supposed to eat eggs without a fork??  They brought one set... for 6 people. Wtf?  I asked for some for everyone and she rolled her eyes at me. She never came back and asked how the food was and never gave anyone refills. We had to walk up to the counter to ask for a refill.  This was my first and last time going.   Sorry, Jim. Your food is good, but the female staff need jobs in a different field, where they don't interact with customers."}
{"text":"So first of all the place isn't really interesting enough to be called something this corny. It's a basic diner with basic diner food. The eggs were small, French toast was bland, bacon was dry and sausage looked like it was reheated and rolled in oil to freshen them up. Overall the breakfast dish I had wouldn't bring me back.  My guest had the double burger special and he liked it, I tried the fries and they tasted frozen, fresh fried. The one thing they had going for them was consistency... The staff was as bland as the food and equally as interesting.  The menu is a little complicated, the cashier made no recommendations and should have just had an ordering button on her forehead. At least that would've have been cooler.  I might pop back in and try the burger before I decide to call it quits. After all, there aren't too many options for good food in Surprise... No surprise."}
{"text":"Gave Jim's a try hoping the kinks noted by other reviewers had been worked out. We found the prices to be fair for the portion size and taste. However, we did think the burger was rather thin which caused it to be more well-done than we enjoy, but the flavor was decent. The fries were crispy on the outside and tender inside, tasty. These were the good points.  Here's the rest of the story... The service was generic, not friendly but also not cold. It was timely but I had to ask for utensils and the runner only brought me a crude, very used looking, steak knife. I then had to ask for a fork, this was my second mistake (the first is detailed below). It felt like a tedious and inefficient exercise that could be avoided by simply providing even basic plastic utensils for patrons.   The place was dirty, just dirty, dirty, dirty. We had to wipe our table down with small, dry, paper napkins from the table-top dispenser (and we picked the cleanest table we could find as all appeared quite dirty during our 3 pm visit). This bugs me because I have no idea who was there before me and what they did. And what the semi-moist smudge of viscous substance was amidst the clearly identifiable salt, pepper, catsup, and lettuce was.   There was a fork laying under the table at my feet and I made the first mistake of the meal, I kicked it out to a visible place on the open floor. When I was forced to ask for a fork, the runner noted and picked up the fork on the floor then returned (in a time frame too short for hand washing to occur) with 'a new fork.' Honestly, I doubt it was the same fork, but she just collected a fork off the floor that had been used by I don't know who, then used her same hands to bring mine. Sorry, that's just nasty... So the aforementioned steak knife sufficed as my sole utensil for the meal. I have more amenities when we camp off-grid!  We were told when we ordered that drinks had free, unlimited refills but we never saw proof of this 'deal' so take your chances with that...   I'm thinking we will have to be exceptionally hungry with absolutely no other options before we visit Jim's again... That clean thing IS a big deal!"}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars because the food is INCREDIBLE. I wish the employees attitudes matched. We have been here a handful of times and the customer service is horrible. The most rude people work in this restaurant, and it's very unfortunate because we love the food!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The hamburgers are juicy and yummy. The fries were good but I did not care for the onion rings. We will be frequenting this place often."}
{"text":"Beyond slow service. They don't do the orders in number order the cooks are too busy putting or burgers and fries since it's fast and put off the breakfast orders. It takes about 30 min to get food even when it's not busy. You ask the servers about your order and they say it's coming because they are scared to ask the owner who is a woman that's working the register. She has the habit of going off in the staff in front of customers. Horrible service"}
{"text":"Josephine is very Unprofessional. She had no customer service, Josephine I did not choose your job, you did! If your not happy at your job change it. You cannot yell at customers and expect them to come back. I have been a loyal customer from the day you opened. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly &  good food . We order here two-three times per week from my job and its always ready when we get there and the staff is nice. Dont let the one lady scare you with her tough ways she is really a cool person."}
{"text":"I love the food here, as far as the lady behind the cash register , if I had to deal with all the  people she has to deal with on a daily basis  I  would get fired within the first half hour....  I have never had a bad meal or experience with anyone here.   It's Burger Place....   If I wanted my as kissed,  I would go to a 5 star restaurant,  and not a burger place. My,  no frill's burger joint.... Love Jim's Burgers and Eggs!"}
{"text":"I went to Jim's yesterday for a late lunch.  Had a 1/2 lb cheeseburger with onion rings and fried mushrooms on the side.  The burger was well prepared to my request, but your not kidding on the other reviews about how much they like to use Thousand Island dressing... Lol.. The batter was phenomenal but could have used some seasoning of some type.   My mom had a breakfast special and it looked great."}
{"text":"The food was good, huge variety which is nice for large parties but seriously, these are the most rude people I have ever met. I work at a local business, we are small family owned and operated and would never ever speak to or treat our PAYING customers the way they do. When people stop coming maybe they will thing \"hmm maybe we shouldn't have treated people like they were annoying us for coming to eat at our restaurant\""}
{"text":"Rude and Nasty!  I was so happy to try this place out considering we don't have a lot of little spots like this in the Surprise area. First of all, whomever is the  old lady with the curly hair behind the counter is RUDE as heck! She screams at the workers and was very rude to me.  Also, please tell me where they put chili on a breakfast burrito. I was so upset that I had to return the burrito, because thats not normal to put that on there. Salsa, yes...but chili, NO!!!!! My burrito was fixed after the \"old lady with the curly hair\" snapped at me like I worked there and it was obvious on the ingredients or something.  This place is not worth it and they need to fix their customer service attitude or it will continue to stay EMPTY!"}
{"text":"Always horrible service. Everyone who works here is so miserable. I hate leaving bad reviews on any place in surprise because I love seeing small businesses survive here but this place is just ridiculous with how rude they always are. I've given it several tries because it's so close to our house. We live in waddell and not much out here but it's the same thing everytime."}
{"text":"Great cozy place to get a burger. Weekend service can be slow. But food is served hot and fresh. Zucchini sticks are to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The food is not that great and they're constantly running out of ingredients, but the service here is the WORSE. Specially from the older lady that's usually running the register. She seems to always be in a bad mood and is very unpleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"Given the joint more then a handful of chances to impress and they disappointed every time. Horrible Customer Service & charged for nearly every item. This last experience was it for me.  I ordered a Hawaiian Burger thinking that was safe bet. When the order came,  I asked for a side of ranch. The young server replied with a strange look on her face \"Did you pay for it? It's $0.50\".  I said \"no, but I'm willing to.\" Having already paid $21 for a burger & fries, two eggs with hash browns and two drinks with my card I started taking it out, and she said \"There is a $5.00 min for card purchases.\" Being as most in this decade I only carry my card.  One might be kind enough to offer it gratis on a one time basis considering the situation, but not a mention.  After that disappointment I started in on eating my burger. To my dismay I bit into a pickle. I had yet to ever have a Hawaiian Burger with pickles on it. This wouldn't be a problem for most people but I am allergic to Cucumbers!! When I told the server. She said \"I don't know what you want.\" I responded \"Can you a so what you can do?\" She dismissively said \"Yeah\" and walked away going to other tables to check on them. After a few minutes she came back and said \"I don't know what you want us to do about it.\" I left already beginning to have a reaction to take my Benadryl to stave off having to use my EpiPen.   Completely unacceptable Customer Service!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The cashier (I think her name is Phyllis) is the most rude woman I've ever come across.  We walked in, started to order she acted as if we were bothering her and wasting her time.  It was our first time walking in there but after she was so rude, we turned around and walked right on out of there. My appetite went away so fast. Never will go there again!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area. This is our first time here. Ordering the food was not bad. But, they don't seem grasp the concept of eating together. They first brought out what they said was my burger. Then they brought my wife's burger, but they had them turned around. Then about 3 minutes later they brought my onion rings. We told the waitress we were expecting a soda and water. It took almost 5 minutes to get our drinks. I had to start eating because if we waited for everything the food would have been cold.   There was only about 15 people eating here at noon. It is not like they were busy.   The coating on the onion rings is really bad and the fries were cold. The burger was all right, but needed salt and pepper added.   I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop place to the fullest. Down to seeing Jim behind the counter. The staff was very friendly, and their menu is pretty expansive. Right now they are in a \"soft opening\" so they are not serving breakfast foods. That was really our only complaint, besides the fact that the employees are still learning the menu themselves and can have a bit of confusion if taking a larger order.   We had a blue cheese burger with onion rings & a double burger with chili cheese fries.  The food was amazing, and well priced for the Surprise area. $5 for a burger and $4 for onion rings are the normal price anywhere around here.  Their onion rings are to die for. The batter they use and fresh onions make for a crispy and fresh side. Their chili is real chili and quiet delicious. Their burgers are more the \"whopper\" type with a very large round patty vs the smaller thick ones. FRESH food for sure.  We waited about 15 minutes for our food, not bad.  All in all we will go back and probably make it a monthly thing."}
{"text":"Still a strange concept to order a burger for breakfast but I ordered a fried egg on mine to make it feel more normal. The burgers are a bit greasy but super tasty and I enjoyed the fries quite a bit. Good little burger joint, worth stopping in for something to cure your hangover!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, the selections were great but the food lacked taste and quality. The burgers were bland and more bread than anything else. Won't be returning..."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and had wanted to try this place for a while. We FINALLY went today (Mothers Day). We ordered our food and sat in our booth at 10am, we got our drinks about 25 minutes later and our food came at 10:57. Yes, we waited almost an hour. According to the waitress they are always this busy on Sunday. The kitchen staff needs to be increased, and unfortunately the food was not worth the wait. The eggs were runny (they were scrambled) and his country fried steak had gravy that tasted like flour. In addition to all of this, when the waitress delivered the food she dropped food in my lap. We will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Great service & nice looking burger & breakfast joint. They have a large variety menu from breakfast burritos, salads to other sandwiches. I ordered the Chicken Gyro & was very disappointed & wifey ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, neither came with fries & was not worth it! Will give it another try but will order breakfast or burgers since thats the main name of this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by today with family from out of town and the food was good! The burgers were ok but the chili cheese fries and fried mushrooms were delicious! We thought the bill was pretty high and after looking at the receipt  (and comparing it to the other family with us) while still eating we noticed we had been charged for two additional combos that we didn't receive or ask for to begin with. My husband went to go clarify with the lady behind the register that we were reading the receipt correctly. She cut him off saying she got it, we had been overcharged for two and gave him money back. He came back to the table saying she was so rude, didn't even let him speak and even moved the receipt away from him to the other side of her when he was asking about it. He only had time to sit back down with us when she comes storming to our table shouting at us that we got everything that was on the receipt and there were three people working in the kitchen that agree with her. Basically calling all of us liars. She starts counting the plates in the table and even shouts for the waitress to come and agree with her. It was ridiculous. Other customers were even like \"is she serious right now?\" It left us feeling completely uncomfortable with her back in the kitchen area pointing at us and still shouting. I just don't understand. My husband went to clarify that we were reading the receipt correctly...maybe we had misunderstood it. She cuts him off, gives him the money back and that could have been it. But then to come yell at us as we're sitting in the restaurant. C'mon. So unprofessional. So rude. We will not be back. And by reading reviews now it looks like it's normal behavior for her."}
{"text":"Food is really good! However, the order taker apparently the owner's wife needs customer service skills. She is rude and very irritable. This restaurant needs a welcoming experience in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food is good. The prices are fair but could be more competitive to other restaurants. The place is very clean and the overall staff are helpful and friendly. The lady owner needs to be more friendly and smile. If she can't please hire a nice gal to take the orders. That will help your business grow."}
{"text":"The Ursula behind the counter has NO business opening her trap. My friend dinky orders a chicken sandwich but it was freezer burned he sent it back and Jim came around the corner foaming at the mouth like a rabid junkyard dog his eyes looked like cold death of Satan's spawn. If looks could kill my friend dinky would have a toe tag! I don't know if this is Greek tradition to treat people so rudely but here in America the customers are always right. This place does have the best damn chili dogs in town though. Although they are rude as hell I did appreciate Jim punking the living hell out of my friend. All in all it was a good day. I guess I'll return for the chili dogs ."}
{"text":"I had seen this place come up on my maps multiple times so decided to try it out... Should have read the reviews first.  Ordered a kids grilled cheese (grilled cheese, fries, small drink)  And then a waffle, a scrambled egg, 2 pieces of sausage and a coffee. Our order came out to $18.50 and I was like WHAT DID WE ORDER?!  The infamous lady at the front said my reciept is itemized when she handed it to me. $6 kids meal which is pretty typical at a restaurant but $6 for just the waffle!  The food was just average and definitely not worth almost $20. Definitely won't be back and feel jipped!"}
{"text":"Food is nothing to write home to about (breakfast). Had to wait longer than usual considering there wasn't really anyone in the building and we ordered simple items. What sticks out for me the most was we were instantly \"greeted\" by the owner with a rude attitude. We should have just walked away at that point but my stomach was talking. How can you treat your paying patrons like that? How are you still even in business because it's obvious it wasn't just me? Secondly, we tried to leave a tip on our credit card and our waitress proceeded to tell us to not bother, because she wouldn't get it anyway. What? I didn't have cash on me so we made sure to walk over to Fry's to get cash out for her because she was the only saving grace at this establishment. I made sure to voice my thoughts on that as well. Moral of the story. Stay away. Go somewhere else. It's seriously not worth it unless you just want to get irritated and get crappy food. Nicks Diner is awesome and your money is better there."}
{"text":"2nd Update: I've been here at least 10-12 times now and I love this place. The food is good and service is good. (1st update on the bottom)   Don't Go on Sunday Morning!  My first impression was pretty bad. The gal taking our order acted like it was the end of the world when my wife wanted her avocado on the side and not on the burger. We then sat at the only empty table, after fifteen minutes I had to ask to get it bused. We did not get our food for 35 minutes!  Side Note: We sat next to another couple who are regulars and said that Sunday mornings are the worst, the service is way better any other time. So, this bad experience, why four starts and not two? The Food Was GREAT! I got an Ortega chili burger, a-maze-ing! My wife got an Avocado Bacon Burger, very pleased. The kids both inhaled their food quickly.  We will be back, but NOT on Sunday, holy crap.  UPDATE: We've been back multiple times now and the place is Awesome! Great Food!"}
{"text":"We waited 90 minutes to get our food.  No apologies were made for the delay.  I won't be going back.   That's  ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Surprise! Finally has a great non chain burger joint. Ordered me a Turkey Burger w extra dressing. It was outstanding! Service was great Food was excellent Value was fair Location was easy to get too. Wait was average for a good burger They also serve Pepsi, so hard to find a good burger and a Pepsi but you will find it here. Say hi to the owners Phyliss and Jim while your here. They are from California"}
{"text":"The only reason there is 1 star is because you can not leave zero!   This was by far the worst $10 Bacon and Eggs I have ever had.     These guys need to clean the grill once in awhile.      Not sure how you screw up Bacon and Eggs with hash browns but theae guys have mastered it."}
{"text":"I thought the food was awesome. The burgers were good, I got the avocado burger and he got the egg burger. My favorite was the fried zucchini. It's the best I've ever had and it's long strips not the round coins most other places have. My customer service experience was perfectly fine."}
{"text":"Employees are flat out rude!  Everyone seems like they don't want to be there! No hello, no thank you. It is more like a self serve place. You do everything but cook your own food!"}
{"text":"Very disrectful owner. Lost my business, it's a shame too. Me and my family loved the food here, but not after seeing how disrespectful and rude the owner is."}
{"text":"When I went in the first thing I noticed was the doors were smudged and dirty.  I was thinking of eating but when I asked a question of one of the wait people (it may have been an owner)  she was kind of short and rude to me so I decided I would not even try the place.  If a place is not friendly and cordial to you when you ask them a question before you even dine the why waste even a penny there?  Really, McDonald's or Burger King will give you friendlier service."}
{"text":"The food here is great, however the employees have some of the worst attitudes you will ever see in people..only worth coming for the food, which is what you want, but expect to receive attitude when you order.       I have been coming here for years and it has been the same attitude towards customers, extremely rude."}
{"text":"I figured we'd try this place again it had been many months since we gave it a go. We waited almost an hour for our food to finally be delivered in full. I watched three other families come in, order their food, sit down, and get their food,  eat it and leave before we ever started getting ours.  They brought our drinks about 25 minutes in so the milk was warm before the food ever arrived. They brought it out in stages with toast first. Who does that? It's cold by the time you get your food. My burrito did not have bacon in it and the girl had to take it back to the kitchen to show the cook to prove he didn't put bacon in it. Then I had to wait multiple minutes for a side of bacon to put in my burrito. I ordered a side of sausage and I asked for it twice and then the waitress said well it's not on the ticket. I said well I ordered it but forget it now.  My husband's food was overcooked and dry. The table next to us waited 45 minutes for their food and when the man asked for coffee when they finally brought his food, the waitress said Oh you you get that yourself.  they had never been there before I think they will probably never go back. He said well it would've been nice if you would have told me that. Then he was afraid to ask for hot sauce because of how long it would take so I gave him ours.  My husband asked for butter which didn't come so he had to go get it from the cook himself. They have you put numbers on your tables but then when they walk out with the food yelling through the restaurant the number.  I guess they're not capable of reading the number that is in a holder at your table so you have to yell through the restaurant when they yell your number. Stupid. The woman who takes the orders is usually the owner I believe or her daughter takes the orders and both of them are snippy.  Never a smile And never a nice word to say. Really unfortunate.  The food is typically pretty good but the service is terrible. We won't be back.  Read the not recommended reviews on here - they are accurate and all ONE STAR."}
{"text":"What rude customer service!  A sizable lady with an accent took our order and acted like every customer was an inconvenience to her with how sharply she spoke. I witnessed three other orders before mine and she made Gordon Ramsay look demure.   They don't have a kids menu posted that I could see and being that it was our first time here I asked if they had kid sized burgers. She replied \"yes we do. It is a burger, fries and small drink\"  I said \"I'd like two of those meals with lettuce and ketchup on the burgers.\"  Her curt reply \"The meals are plain and only come with the bun and meat\"  So my obvious question \"do you carry ketchup?\" Which she said \"yes\"  My next obvious question \"I can't have ketchup and lettuce put on them?\" She just peered at me over her glasses and said my order total. I had no idea if that meant I would have the burgers prepared how I asked. I ordered a regular size burger for myself too.  (Oh and in the middle of ordering our food, the she turned and started talking to one of the cooks behind her and commenting about what a customer on the patio was doing)  Ironic now that I think about it. They have a sign posted by their register that basically says \"we can refuse service to anyone\". Speaks volumes as to how their view their customer base.   Surprisingly the burgers arrived with lettuce and ketchup.   The only positives: basic thick cut fries were hot and arrived with the appropriate toppings.   I'm sorry but not everyone on earth enjoys burnt hockey pucks for patties. And it took me three bites of bun to actually hit meat. I have a feeling I was also served a kid size burger on a regular bun. At least I HOPE their buns aren't meant to eclipse the meat.   They must have killer breakfast or something because I don't know how they stay open with how rude they are and with such badly prepared the burgers.   Now I'm headed to find myself something else to eat."}
{"text":"Went to Jim's Burger and Eggs with my 10yr daughter this morning and wow old lady is very rude!we even told her it out first time there, you think she would at least have smile and say welcome to Jim's , but nope! All W got was\" what do you want to eat?\" I had a coupon in my hand, which was visible, so when she totally up our order, I handed her the coupon, she sighed & said angrily said \"now I have to cancel your order and do it again\" she said\" you have to give me your coupon before you order.\" I did apologize and told her again it's our first time & I didn't know you had to give her the coupon when we ordered. After we finish ordering I said \"thank you,\" and only got \"you need to take you number\" which she laid it on the counter top. I'm definitely not over sensitive, but come on, a little courtesy will go along way.  Now for the Food: after hearing about jim's burger and eggs, I wanted to be wowed, but it was just ok. I will spend my money else where. We will not be coming back. Thank you."}
{"text":"My sisters took me there to check it out and see if I enjoyed it they were right it was very good and Romy and the people were  nice"}
{"text":"I wish I would have read all of the reviews here on Yelp before I ever stepped in the door of this place.  In my entire 48 years of dining out I have NEVER been treated so horrifically by a \"manager\" of a restaurant.  I guess this guy was a manager as I was referred to him when I had a question, he was also cooking.  He refused to sell me a small side of an item I wanted to dip my food in and he actually mocked and imitated me when I asked him about it!  I didn't know how to respond since I was so stunned by the way I was being treated and just told the guy to never mind.  He sharply chirped back, \"Okay!\" and turned away as if he wanted me to know he was more than happy to dismiss me rather than make sure I was a satisfied customer.  After his attitude toward me I was seriously concerned that he was going to spit in my family's food or something of the like.  I really wish I would have just asked to cancel our order.  The food here was a step up from McDonalds, definitely overpriced for what it is. Because of the way this man treated me I will NEVER go anywhere near Jim's Burgers and Eggs again.  My husband works nearby and he and his co-workers would eat here quite often.  After my kids and I told him about what this guy did, he said he would never eat here again and tell all of his buddies not to either."}
{"text":"I ordered a double burger with no sauce, I got it home and it had sauce on it (I confirmed no sauce again when picking my order up at the counter). I called them once I got it home and discovered this and was told by someone who said his name was \"Mick\" to simply come by and  get another burger free of charge on another day since they were about to close. About a week later I do this and the infamous lady was at the counter. She told me that anyone could say this and that I was making it up. She is rude and insulting. I will NEVER go back. Prior to this I went there a handful of times and I see that they stay relatively busy BUT customer service like this will eventually hurt this \"mom and pops burger shop\". Had they done what they told me they were going to do over the phone they would still continue to have me as a customer. Instead they insulted me, you lost a customer here Jims Burgers and Eggs!"}
{"text":"So first impressions....the decor in the place looked like it was a little confused....is it a new style diner? But being a food lover instead of an interior designer I really could care less as to what the place looked like. I ordered a triple burger I think it was a California burger it had huge chunks of bacon what looked like to be American cheese that melted right out of the burgers it had shredded lettuce and tomatoes and to top it off it had fresh jalapeños.  It was in my top 5 burgers of all time. It came with fries which weren't anything special. But with a good huge burger who cares why even have em? I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Yes I just experienced the terrible service myself. I give management and the owner 1 star for being crazy enough to keep these terrible employees working here. Open your eyes and read your Yelp & Google  reviews....Even if these employees are related to you,  dude just fire them so I can enjoy your delicious burgers in peace. Just sayin"}
{"text":"Very Good...    burger and fries are always excellent.  I have been there at least 10 times and they ate always good.  Most of the cashier are nice.  One time  the cashier didn't know how to make change...  She definitely needs to stay in school.  I am still going to go back for my burger \"fix\"  lol"}
{"text":"I am really disappointed to write this review. When I saw the name, I thought now this is my kind of place. I love breakfast and we both love burgers. I ordered breakfast and my wife ordered a burger and fries. The eggs were cooked correctly, but the hash browns were not even close to being cooked. The toast was dripping with what appeared to be the butter flavored oil they use on the grill. My wife could not begin to eat her french fries. They looked like they had cooked them once and then took the old fries cold fries and cooked them a second time. They were dark brown with loads of grease. I would love to visit this place every week or two but never again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I keep thinking that next time will be a better experience. This place has great food, I'll give them that. But the customer service is worse than McDonald's. I ordered a specific burger with a specific drink, and got neither of those when I got home. After waiting 30min and finally getting home, I had no care left to ask for them to fix it because of 1) the people on yelp say they just get a \"sorry\" and 2) I was hungry. I do not wish to slander Jim's Burger, but if you wish to have a successful business in food, care."}
{"text":"Great food. Service isnt amazing..but im going for the good food not the amazing service. Always good food. Always."}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers. It's really a toss up between this place and Culiver's for a freshly made great tasting burger. I only wish the pastrami was a true pastrami sandwich. I'd take it on rye or sourdough or an onion roll, but not too fond of it on the French roll. Plus it's not as juicy as I'm accustomed to getting from a true deli. Overall a good burger joint."}
{"text":"Yesterday, 5th of July 2014, was not the first time I've been to this establishment. Jim is a really nice guy and so are his staff. Well, except for one: his wife. Hence, the 2 stars.   I've been eating here since it opened and the food is always good, the people are always nice. Again, except for Phyllis. I could really call her another name but I won't.   It's really simple: if you do not like people in general, stop working the cash register and work the sink in the back washing dirty plates, cups and silverwares.   I like patronizing small business owners but her attitude is really getting ridiculous. Sorry, Jim. Never coming back ever."}
{"text":"I literally don't care what anyone says about the cashier lady, the food is worth her being mean to me lol   she never has been, but I'd willingly accept it if she was, as a trade for my favorite patty melt ever. Pastrami is so good too."}
{"text":"Food is good and the prices are good but the wait time for our food to be delivered has become increasingly worse over the last few months.  We are regulars here, but today we have been waiting for 50 minutes and still no drinks or food.  Time to find a new breakfast place!"}
{"text":"It's just ok. I've been there 3 times & its pretty unremarkable. The first time I just got a 1/4 lb burger, fries & drink. Omg, I couldn't find the meat! The flavor was good, but I love thousand island dressing on burgers. Anyway, I've since gotten the 1/2 lb burger and it's at least beefy. I'm a little afraid of the 2 older women behind the counter, if you are not ready to order, they will pass you up, without blinking an eye. Kind of a \"New York\" trendy deli attitude, but it's not working. I guess IF their food was to die for, they could act like that, but not in Surprise, AZ."}
{"text":"Breakfast is real good comfort food and a must have. Lunch and dinner not so much. Premade fried foods that aren't that good. Do breakfast here only. I do have a tip for the restaurant - put the silverware on the table. I can't count how many times I have had to ask for silverware after I have my food."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area, decided to try Jim's, I must say I thought I was watching the episode of Seinfeld and the soup Nazi! I was in line behind 3 teenage boys, upon them reaching the order counter, she informed them that any misbehaving and they will be tossed out of the restaurant! They seemed well behaved to me, anyway. I stepped up with my arms firmly at my side, head up, eye contact, spoke clearly, whew, got my order in. I've been back a number of times and am relieved when the older lady isn't taking my order. I did order a \"to go\" order and stood there for 20 plus minutes after my food was boxed and put on the back counter, watched parties of 5 and 6 come, place their orders, get their food, eat their food and leave before the lady realized I had been standing there waiting for my order for over 30 minutes. I order the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon and it's always hot and delicious. Had the burger once, seemed pretty good, certainly better than JIB or McDonalds. I do sort of feel sorry for the help, seems like they might be treated like employees that worked for that Amy lady from Amys Bakery featured on Chef Ramseys show, one screw up and \"you are fired\"!"}
{"text":"If you want a flavorless meal with a side order of a condescension (I believe her name is Phyllis, she's the cashier), I would recommend this place to you. Let's be honest, this food isn't special. The breakfast cost me $9.35~ roughly for two eggs, two pancakes, and two slices of toast. The pancakes were doughy/mushy in the middle, the eggs were nothing special, and the toast was drenched in fake imitation butter, or whatever the bulk business brand is for the equivalent of \"Parkay.\" I thought the place was pretty dirty. As I walked in, I saw a lot of dust hanging down from the ceiling. The first coffee cup I picked up had food from the previous use still on it.   This almost ten dollar lesson has taught me: This food here competes with Denny's (I'd give the upper hand to Denny's unfortunately) and I definitely won't be returning in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Jim's! The philly cheese steak definitely hit the spot and the reasonable prices did not break my wallet. Hubby and I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Alright....so I came to this restaurant because I found it via Yelp. Despite the 2.5 stars I observed the restaurant to have..........I decided to check this place out for myself. I saw all of the nasty comments about the \"mean lady behind the counter\" and well.....she was present. I could see where some people would believe that she is mean, but....I also observed her to smile and laugh with some customers.   Aside from that...the restaurant has a large interior with tables and chairs. Good for groups or large parties. The restaurant was clean and the for the most part....the staff was good.   Onto the food. I ordered the ham and egg sandwich with an orange juice. Total price would have been $7. Except (and here is where my one star rating comes in) the extra $2 I had to pay for egg whites. Are you freaking kidding me?? I've seen places where it was an extra $.50 or an extreme cases....a dollar. The sandwich contents were smaller than the bread.   The sandwich was ok but I'm pissed about the extra cost. I like eating healthy and egg whites are part of my healthy regimen. I will NEVER return because of this small incident."}
{"text":"Never again...everyone do not go here ...never again will I go or recommend this shit whole place....I asked for a burger and they brought me a burrito. ..I told them nicely no sorry I ordered a burger they server said iam sorry I'll take it back .....she then came back 2 mins later with the burrito and said this...the owner said she thought I said burrito so they will not make me a burger that I had to eat the burrito. .it's my fault not there's she said..I said to her are you F...in kidding me she said no sorry ...so I then went to the owner angry and had my share of words and they didn't even care or fixed the problem. ...how is it my fault that you need a hearing aid ..this place makes me sick to my stomach and I hope you read this cause you know who I am you careless ass people I hope you fail again like you guys failed  in California. ..probably for the same reasons....."}
{"text":"Wow! I called in for a breakfast burrito only, and the girl says its a 45 minute wait....really!!!"}
{"text":"ok been here 3 times and now and I'll say have nothing but great meals, burger great breakfast burritos best I have had in Phoenix thus far! everything is great"}
{"text":"I live 25 miles away from Jims but I am sure to stop by this place every time I visit my mother..  it's my favorite burger place and the breakfast is exceptional as well..   5 star place"}
{"text":"Food is really good. The breakfast burger, the fish sandwich, the Philadelphia cheesesteak, the fries and onion rings, and the pancakes are great. The service is poor unfortunately."}
{"text":"Had this place for the first time last night with my husband! OMG! It blew my mind how delish their food was! I got \"The Special\" which was a meaty and delicious burger with a fried egg on it, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions! But I added sliced Avocado! It was literally the best burger I've had in a long time.. I'd go as far as to say, best burger I've had in the last year! SO so good!"}
{"text":"I have never been treated as poorly as I was at any restaurant before tonight.  If the food wasn't  really good I would say no stars but one star for the food.   We came here on a recommendation from family who normally goes during the day. Apparently the morning crew is on point and polite. We were appalled by how horrible our experience was from walking in the door. It was busy which I feel flustered the employees who clearly lack experience in multi tasking. When we ordered, it being our first time there, we were not met by a friendly face and had no help with the menu. The lady was rude and just wanted us to hurry so she can move on even after we apologized for not understanding how things worked here.   When we finally got our food. We were given things that weren't ours and the lady who ran the food at first didn't even care to listen when we told her it wasn't. They also forgot our drinks and when we asked for them she was rude when asking what ordered as if it wan inconvenient for her to get them. It took at least seven times for four of us to get our correct order and only after someone else had to take over.   The girl who took over, the young girl with bangs, was super polite and did apologize. She is the only reason we didn't leave immediately. I could see she was running the show and was the only who looked like she cared about her job.  I'm sorry I did not get her name but she deserves all the credit for making this restaurant.   At least the food was good. The cooks were also on point getting meals out in a timely manner and as far as I could tell were correct. They just need some way of keeping everyone's orders correct rather than writing them down on paper that no one even checks.   Needless to say, we will not be returning until this restaurant get its act together if it's even here for that long."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast, and it took 31 minutes to deliver it to us.  Eggs were over done, and bland bland bland.  I'm willng to try their pastrami burger and report back, however."}
{"text":"I was told the food here was good but service might be lacking. Went in yesterday for lunch and there was a small line and the place was fairly packed so I figure the food at least must be decent. Went through and ordered and paid for our food and grabbed one of the cleaner tables. The condiment containers are all pretty gross. I understand when a place is busy you can't necessarily get everything as sparkling as it maybe should be but the ketchup was dried and caked onto the bottle, that doesn't happen in a short while. Cleanliness aside, our server was pleasant and the food was pretty good. It wasn't the greatest burger and fries I've ever had but it was worth going back for.   That said, the management/owners seem to treat their staff poorly. I watched several interactions with the servers that made me think this place runs like a prison. Asking for a to-go box became a problem for our server because apparently she had the audacity to give me one of the larger boxes instead of a smaller one. I've never seen so many people chastised for whatever they did wrong, out in the open during a rush. Seeing that turned me off pretty fast and you can see how their behavior changes the demeanor of the servers. Not sure if I'll be back but I doubt it. I can get better food elsewhere and not watch the workers being berated as a side dish."}
{"text":"Busy and staff was smoothly and quickly serving everyone! Breakfast burrito is great!"}
{"text":"Tic Toc Tic Toc - called in order (garden burger, cheeseburger and 2 fries) at 10:55am it's now 11:25am and still no sign.  My family lives the food here, maybe it's me but timely service, mmmh?! Owner cashier tending picks and chooses whom she smiles to - don't ever hesitate on ordering."}
{"text":"Fabulous food for the price. You won't find anywhere like this at least not in Surprise! Jim's has a great ambiance, for both the single or family diners. The decor shows a little wear and tear, but we were really surprised by what you got for the price. The Waitresses are awesome and the service is very nice.  There is many choices on the menu and full breakfast menu served all day. The owners are kind and friendly, nice to see them actively interested in their business. I would go back and am considering getting my son's lunches from there for school next term. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I ordered a \"country fried steak\" with gravy, extra hashbrowns, and an OJ. Total was $16.95! Country fried steak is frozen trash with packet gravy. The toast is from a cheap $1.00 loaf of bread. Hashbrowns are rehydrated disgustingness. Toast is covered in margarine, and the eggs are also cooked in margarine.  I also experienced the lady with glasses and as everyone else says she was terribly rude. No customer service skills, no smile, not even a hello. If you want overpriced mediocre food with absolutely no service than this is the place for you.   P.S. Good luck on someone \"checking up on you\"  or possibly even getting a refill because no one will come to your aid.  PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I am highly amazed at how great tasting these chili cheese fries taste. Love the chili, I found small pieces of bacon. Who would of thought to add bacon? Bacon makes everything Taste better. Next I'll have to try the burgers, the look good. We don't have that many good burger joints in Phx like this place. I'm surprised since Yelp has them at a 3 start rating. I would give them a 4. Only because they have Pepsi products and I'm a Coca Cola girl."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Jim's since it's close to home and we could use a good diner out here. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. My boyfriend and I just ordered standard breakfast-- I had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and we split hashbrowns. The pancakes were undercooked, the bacon was so overcooked it was basically inedible, and the hashbrowns were also too crispy. It was not a cheap breakfast by any means and the girl who brought us our food didn't even say one word to us. I've heard other people say they enjoyed their food but just from that one bad experience, I have to say I will not go back, no matter how close it is."}
{"text":"Good, not great could do better! Husband an I both ordered Bacon breakfasts burritos ...husband liked his, me I thought it needed.more Bacon that needed to be crispy not chewy and coulda did without the chili bean salsa ..."}
{"text":"Yeah, 3-stars is more than this joint deserves (I'm being generous).  Burgers were decent, but nothing to write home about. The service... Hahha ha! Omg, all the other reviews were spot on about the crabby lady at the register! Holy cow!!  She needs to learn some proper customer service techniques.  Sadly, didn't see the waiter-management drama noted in other posts.   Egg Burger: the 1/4lb patty was cooked beyond recognition and flatter than a pancake. The only reason it wasn't dry tasting was because of the loads of thousand island slathered all over it. Even the egg didn't help with the moistness much. The lettuce tasted old :-/  Chicken Fried Steak Sandwich: of course it was a pre-made/pre-breaded patty. Still, it was nice and crisp on the outside. Again, the condiment of choice was thousand island dressing (wtf is up w that?)  Fries: surprisingly good, with a good crispy outside/soft inside. Sadly... cold *sigh*  Pancakes: flavorless, overly chewy, mushy sweet-bread. Lots of butter helped... some"}
{"text":"From the second I walked in I felt completely unwelcome. I asked a simple question to the lady taking my order, simply because I was confused. She looked at me like I was dumb and like she had no care in the world to help me make a purchase. After placing my order I realized it did not come with jalapeños so I walked back to ask to add jalapeños and was treated poorly for adding something 30 seconds later and had to pay 2$ for a jalapeño. That's way over priced. After we got our meal to go I went up to the lady and asked for a ranch and she rudely told me there was two in the bag. Two for a burger and a salad. And that if I wanted more it would cost me. Overall the lady working the register was just completely rude and I will not be back. After sharing this experience with my mother in law she told me she went there a week ago and had a similar experience but she asked to complain to the manager and the manager actually made her cry. This place sucks. Customer service is everything and they completely fail that category. DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"Visited some friends and ventured off to this place. At first we thought the experience was going to be good because the place was packed. When we got our food, 45 minutes after ordering (omelet and french toast only), we noticed that the cheese on the omelet was CLEARLY processed cheese, not real. Ok, we let that pass. Then after a few bites into the omelet, there was egg mucus/slime, and that is where we drew the line and decided to take it back. This is where the real problem started.   The nasty woman who runs the register, we will call her \"Hilda\" (overweight, older, short afro) for now, turned into an animal. She was very \"offended\" that we did not shut up and eat up the slimy, half cooked omelet. She also was outraged that we said the cheese was processed and LIED and said \"NONE of our cheese is processed! ALL of our cheese is 100% real cheese!!!!!!!!!\" I know real cheese, and I have no respect for a business that lies about ingredients. NO RESPECT. She is a sicko in my opinion to lie and snap at customers like that. Then she lied, loudly, by screaming that we ate \"half\" of the omelet, and then had the nerve to say she will throw it back on the grill. WTF!!! DISGUSTING. You want to throw a \"half eaten\" omelet on the grill after my fork went from my mouth to the omelet??? So your other customers have to eat food from a grill that could have my saliva on it? GET OUT OF HERE, HILDA!!! She is VILE for that! We declined and asked if we can get another item that was ONLY HALF the price of the omelet just to keep it simple. By the way, how in the world would we have known that there was egg mucus in our omelet had we not started eating it? Think, you miserable woman!  Then she loudly complained to who, I believe, was her husband. She let him, and all of the customers, know that \"these people had just ate half of the omelet and now they want something else altogether different after I offered them to throw it back on the grill.\" Her husband asked what we wanted instead. He quickly and kindly said, \"Absolutely. No problem at all.\" HE, was VERY NICE and professional and did what any good business owner does; makes the customer happy within reason. I am not saying he needs to divorce this bat (although only he knows the hell he lives with being married to her), but he needs to DUMP her from his business as she is KILLING IT! Look at the reviews. I see most of the negative reviews are about HER.   By the way, the french toast was good. The Omelet, before we discovered the slime, was mediocre and bland.  There are too many nice places to eat at in Arizona, so I don't think I will be spending money here again. I should have just handed the money to the panhandler on the corner; it would have been money well spent in comparison."}
{"text":"Decent food... Got the egg burger and fries . Sad thing is it took 40 minutes to get... Not best place when it's busy"}
{"text":"DON'T GET THE BREAKFAST... Everyone I know that likes Jim's says the same thing \"stay away from the breakfast menu\" and for good reason. The place should just be named Jim's Bomb Burgers  Now that that's out of the way, I can tell you that Jim really knows how to put together a good burger. If you like hot things, they have the Jalapeno Ghost-Cheese burger which is out of this world, only if you like hot things though.  If you don't like jalapenos I would suggest at least getting a slice of ghost cheese thrown on your burger (a bit spicy but sooo amazing!)  Tip: Don't get a regular burger(how could you), Instead order one of the specialty burgers and I promise you won't be disappointed. Just remember two words GHOST CHEESE"}
{"text":"I really like the food and the setup at this spot. But the lady, guessing she's the owner, is so consistently rude! She makes no attempt to smile or make you feel welcome. And I know I'm not the only one who thinks this. Wish she would fix this, put a smiling face up front to greet you and take your order. I would come a lot more if that was the case."}
{"text":"The service is shit. If you like being treated poorly by other than just your wife please feel free. The curly haired woman at the register gave me a look I won't soon forget but I wish I could. The most unpleasant woman. Jim the actual guy is ok, he doesn't talk much. Pretty sure they beat their staff seeing how they seem timid and scared. The food is good but at what cost? Your dignity, your marriage? Your country ? No thank you."}
{"text":"EXPECT HORRIBLE SERVICE. Service sucked, waitress and cashier both seemed like they hate their jobs or people, or both. When in line the customer in front of my friend's and I whispered \"Once you get past the horrible service their food is great\" and she was right! I had the avocado bacon burger and my friend had a chili burger. Chili tasted great! And my burger was delicious! Fries were great too! I enjoyed the food. Waitress gave me a soda with no ice and never came around. She seemed to almost avoid coming out from behind the counter, instead I asked a very kind bus boy if he could do me the favor and he was glad to do so. I ordered the fried zucchini and the waitress didn't bring it over until we were done with our food and leaving so I asked for a refund and I was able to receive it. So in conclusion if you have the patience the food was good. I'm willing to try the breakfast because the cooks there are great! But not anytime soon, just eventually."}
{"text":"At least im not the only one here to say.... Rude customer service! I mean seriously put a better girl upfront because I was ready to walk out the second she started taking my order. Made me feel so uncomfortable and like um hurry up what do you want. Also it took 30 minutes to get a lemonade. I understand your busy and the food may take some time. But when I was a server I was taught your table should have beverages within 5 minutes of them sitting down. Get some better employees cuz these ones got to go! At least the very RUDE one up front!!! I was there last sunday morning ... Im sure you can narrow it down to who was working then!"}
{"text":"Still waiting for my food. Had enough time to download yelp app, create an account and write a review. Don't care how good the food is nothing is worth waiting over an hour for. Great place to go if you want to waste a Sunday afternoon waiting on pancakes."}
{"text":"Went with the family.   My wife's gyro was meaty,  but completely bland.   There was nothing good about the avocado burger,  the avocado was also really old.  The onion rings were overcooked and lacking flavor.   The sweet potato fries were too salty.   On top of that,  when we ordered our sandwiches they asked us what sides we would like as though the side came with the meal,  but the sides are separate and we didn't find that out until it was too late.   It was just Overpriced cramps food."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers fries and omelets put it down as the place to go.. gyro too. Thus is a great place for omelettes and breakfast."}
{"text":"This is my second review of this terrible place. First of all the Burgers are horrible. You'd think for a burger place they might have good Burgers. Nope they stink. But I will give them this they have good gyros. So the other day I called I am order to pick up. So I call I get put on hold for three minutes. When the girl came back to the phone she told me to call back because she is not allowed to be on this phone line.. Lol? Do I said I'm driving I prefer not top call back. I said I will take my business elsewhere. She said ok and hung up on me. Needless to say I will never go back and will do my best to make sure everyone I know never visits as well. You need to hire a some decent employees or you will close. Look at your reviews you have a problem and you should work on fixing it before you lose all of your customers."}
{"text":"Meh...  I have lived in Surprise for over a year now.  There aren't too many \"good\" (hell, they aren't really ANY \"good\" restaurants in Surprise) restaurants around these parts.  I live about 2 minutes from Jim's Burgers and Eggs.  My wife went here one time before and she said it was decent.  For whatever reason, today we decided to check it out.    We walked in and I studied the menu board for a minute or so.  The infamous \"unfriendly lady at the front counter\" was staring at us and finally asked if we knew what we wanted.  My wife asked a question about what comes on the burgers, and the lady shoved a menu in her face, pointed at what comes on them and then read the ingredients off really fast.  She could have either showed us the menu, or just told us...not made a big production like it was a big deal.  Anyways....my wife ordered her burger and asked for it well done.  The lady wrote it down but did not confirm it.  My wife is the type of person who won't eat a burger if there is red or pink in it, so she always orders well done.  I went next and ordered a triple cheeseburger and some onion rings.  When all was said and done, my wife kindly reminded her \"well done\" and the lady kind of snapped back and said, \"Do you want HIS well done too?\".  It was a very unpleasant and uncomfortable interaction.  Anyways...2 burgers, fries, onion rings and a soda were $21.00.  Here is how the food was.........  Triple Cheeseburger-  Meh.  It looked better than it tasted.  The first bite in, I got a great charbroiled taste and thought it was going to be fantastic.  Sadly, the charbroiled bites were skimp and I only encountered a few good bites.  The burger patties they use were not that great and they tasted plain as can be (could have used some salt) except around the edges.  The cheese wasn't even fully melted either.  I tried to finish most of it but I just couldn't.  I won't be coming back here for burgers again.  Onion Rings-  Now these things were delicious!  A bit skimp for the price (8 or so rings for $5.00), but they tasted great.    Fries-  Just plain standard fries.  Could have been cooked 20 seconds longer to make them more crispy. My son who LOVES french fries, didn't even eat them.  He took a bite of one and threw it on the floor.  Service after the initial encounter was fine.  The lady who brought us our food was smiling at least and pretty chipper.  They did bring things out in waves though and not all at once.  I got my burger first.  Then the rings came out, then my wifes burger and fries.  It was just a tad odd.   Overall, it wasn't the worst meal I ever had, but it was too pricey for what you got.  I will drive the extra 20 minutes down Bell to Whataburger or to an In N Out.  They are half the price, better quality and both places have much friendlier service.  I really wanted to like this place but sadly I don't think I am ever coming back."}
{"text":"Poor service...can't use any card that has a chip in it. Then my order wasn't taken down right so when I went back to the counter I had to buy another meal because they would not make the situation right. I liked coming here but, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Better off going to Nick's diner for now. Thanks Jim for great customer service. Try to find more independent restaurants to support over chain restaurants."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Surprise! Always very friendly service, always welcoming as if you were an everyday regular! Awesome burgers!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with 11 of us here. My experience is the customer service needs lots if help. The cashier was less then friendly. She wrote all 11 orders on one small  piece if paper, even when I suggested she use more then one so the order can be read clearly for the cooks. Of course as I thought, the orders were made wrong. The waitress that brought the food to our table was beyond RUDE! We were 25 minutes into eating before we had all of our drinks and when I asked for silverware to cut the burgers she told me when she gets a chance... I went and grabbed them myself. Once food was delivered, she never came back, no offers for refills for the drinks or to check on us. The food while hot was just an average burger and fries. Breakfast was good and the fried chicken sandwich I ordered was terrible.  Maybe with a small group it would have been a better night."}
{"text":"When ordering the person was extremely rude. She told me I don't know what I want. Took forever to get the food. In-n-out burger has better burgers. I will not waste my money here I'd rather drive another 20 minutes for quality food."}
{"text":"I am absolutely undeniably appalled at the customer service this establishment has . When I was asked  what I would like to eat, it was as unprofessional as it gets. \"What do you want? HELLO  what do you want\" I proceeded to tell the woman and she looked at me and rolled her eyes at me as if I was saying something rude when it was just my order. After my order is place and I get my food I see her refuse service to another women who has a trained service dog. Now I understand she has the right to refuse service to anyone but after she did she proceeded to make jokes about the women and the dog when she left. I assure you that I'm not the only one who has encountered something like this when eating here. I have seen previous reviews and if I could give this place no stars I would. Disgusted."}
{"text":"We were driving from MN to CA and stopped here for a mid-morning breakfast. We placed our order at the counter, grabbed a mug and poured ourselves coffee. We sat down and enjoyed GREAT coffee while our meal was cooked.   The food was delicious, reasonably priced and abundant. On top of this, there was a very friendly young woman who brought our food, refilled our coffee, and pleasantly directed us to the freeway nearby.  She was the best server we've had on our trip!"}
{"text":"The best place to eat burgers if you from Midwest East coast it remind me like in Midwest,I'm having the Stake and eggs Top the line yummy  I give them 5 star."}
{"text":"My family and I love their burgers!!  They have a large menu and it's all very affordable."}
{"text":"My son LOVES the country fried steak breakfast.  It's his absolute fave.  We've been several times and expect to have to wait.  We wait because it's his fave.  Today we waited over half an hour and still no drinks.  I inquired to find they had lost our ticket.  They put it at the end of the ticket line and we waited another half hour for our food.  No apology, no nothing to make amends.  I work in a restaurant, I understands mistakes are made but this was unacceptable.  Finding a new place for country fried steak.   Yelp makes you leave a star, but this is a zero star rating"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed everything about my dining experience here today. The cashier was friendly and greeted me as soon as i steped in line. I got a bacon cheeseburger w/ fries and zucchini. Everything was delicious and fresh. I sat on the patio and the waitress out there was also friendly and i appreciate the outside dining option. The food has an old-school diner feel to it. Nothing fancy or pretentious here. This place is not for the needy or picky. Which in my opinion is why most but not all the people feel the need to give them bad reviews on service. This establishment is a family owned buisness and has made their menu. You get what you see, it is not the costumers right to come in and modify or change things to their own liking. If you want to change everything and you dont like the service start your own buisness and run it how ever you want, that's what your entitled to. This is a prime example of where corporate restaurants have nearly ruined it for small time restaurants like  Jim's, they have single handedly created a society of entitled restaurant goers. Jim's Burgers i think you guys are doing it right. I like your food, your service and your easy going ambiance. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Thought we would give it a try, the place was packed and decent prices. Ordered our food and waited 58 minutes for 3 cheeseburgers. The couple next to us said that is a normal wait time. Finally get our food hoping it would be worth the wait but it was just ok. Kinda bland but not awful. May try the breakfast sometime but only on a day when I have plenty of time to wait."}
{"text":"Decent food does not overcome the horrible, rude customer service. I gave this place several chances to get it right, but the woman at the counter was consistently awful. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast fare. Breakfast burritos are incredible as are the eggs and pancakes.  Never had lunch or dinner yet. I've eaten breakfast there 3 times now and it's always fantastic. Shocked by all the bad reviews . Give em a try."}
{"text":"The menu is huge but I've only had 3 different items on it because why would you want to mess with perfection?  So here it goes:  #1 THE PASTRAMI.  Do you like pastrami?  You'll love this pastrami sandwich.  Simple enough right?  #2 The fried mushrooms.  Dip them in ranch.  Feel like you're a little more \"cultured\" than someone who just eats fries.    #3 Some kind of breakfast sausage sandwich thing... to be honest I don't remember what it's called but it's pretty good.  It had thousand island in it, which was different but a good different.  It's obviously not one of my go-to's or I'd remember what it was called, but I figured I ought to list it since I'm listing everything I've ever ordered from here.  Look, if you live close to Jim's, you don't live close to a ton of variety.  Their staff won't make you feel like \"everyone knows your name\" but they get the job done.  And the food taste homemade-ish enough that you feel like you're breaking up the monotony of endless meals at endless chain restaurants.  Overall, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Good affordable food. Friendly and helpful, but distracted staff. If you are bold and ask for what you need, this is a great place. If you just sit and wait, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super rude with even the most basic questions. Go somewhere else.  McDonald's service will be better. Seriously."}
{"text":"The food is very good- burgers, sandwiches. Gyros tasty but not authentic...no vertical rotisserie in sight and cut very thick. Sad. Bitchy older woman at counter during day shift/lunches. Lovely counter staff at night.  We come back because it is reasonably priced good food when you want a burger that is not fast food. IH-  AWESOME ONION RINGS!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but it takes forever to get it. It took 45 minutes just to get our drinks, and 10 minutes after that to get our food. The workers aren't very friendly with the exception of an older lady who was a server. We've been there twice but will be in no hurry to go back. If they just fixed the issues with their service, we'd be frequent visitors."}
{"text":"What turned me off with this place is the sign that reads \"we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone\", in my experiences that is a very unprofessional way to conduct a business, any complaint would be grounds for refusal of service, not a good business practice... I walked out immediately..."}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place 4 or more stars either knows the owner or IS the owner with a bogus Yelp profile. This place is just awful all around and the old lady at the counter needs to change her cranky pants. Too bad this place is taking up space in a great neighborhood when a better restaurant could be occupying that space. Oh well it's a matter of time so we'll just be patient until a real burger joint shows up."}
{"text":"the wait staff is great.  very friendly and happy for the most part.  the older lady who took my order was not the friendliest.  I got the 2 eggs and biscuit with gravy that comes with hash browns and toast. I asked for a side of bacon and a coffee.  the meal is priced on the menu for $6.95.  there is no bacon side listed anywhere I could see.  the coffee is $1.90 so my total was 13.74.  so looks like I was charged 3.75 for 2 pieces of bacon that were cooked yesterday.  yep not fresh at all.   the biscuits were made with lard or oil that is old.  you can taste it.  you know that rancid oil/lard smell/taste.  yep.  not good.  could have been much better.  for what they are charging they need fresh foods and biscuits that taste like fresh with a buttery taste not a rancid oil taste.   not impressed and I wont be back. and by the way I am also a restaurant owner and I know fresh when I taste it.  we only use fresh items in our establishment.   skip this one."}
{"text":"Food is decent and nothing to brag and/or write home about. Don't get the hash browns! Worst I have ever tasted. Waffles are decent besides the 8 pounds of butter they threw on top. Pretty sure this place won't last if their service doesn't change. Seriously the worst customer service I have ever received....and the food is over priced! There was a mid aged/older lady who took our order. She was RUDE! Someone told me that she is the owner, which totally makes sense because the waitress mirrored her attitude. I will NEVER go back! I work in the area, when I returned and told them about the service the said, \"Oh, yeah, they are known for poor service, we never go there.\""}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because the food truly is good if you don't have to wait an hour to get it. Ordering is hard when you encounter rude customer service from someone who has clearly worked here too long. If she is part of the family she should reconsider cooking in the kitchen instead of dealing with customers after reading all of these reviews.  Unfortunately being rude to people won't make people continue to support this business. We were brought the wrong drinks after waiting 15 minutes to get them. And waited so long that we came to eat breakfast and it ended up being lunch. Don't come here if you are trying to do anything the rest of the day. I normally don't leave any reviews that are negative because I prefer to support the positive experiences I have but this was way too ridiculous. And I actually just dropped it down to one star because while trying to get my Togo order they didn't want to give me another drink because their dr pepper syrup ran out and the lady said \"it's the gas all of the soda is going to taste like that...\" Most people would spring I to action a fix the problem don't you think. Clearly after waiting over and hour for food you would think they would be helping us better when we get our food to go! Ridiculous I will never go back and I wouldn't give them your service either"}
{"text":"I like the food here, but the woman who runs the register is a real live a#%hole. Very rude. Just ignore the beeatch and enjoy the food. Part of me says to not support businesses with crappy attitudes, but I do like the food here."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!!  Hash Browns were nice and crispy!!  Eggs were perfectly scrambled and the coffee was good!! The burgers looked delicious, can't wait to go back and try their fried shrimp and fish."}
{"text":"Friendliest service ever! We come here a lot & love the company. We had a hard time finding a good breakfast place since moving from Cali. And then we were sent here. Sometimes there is a wait, but being in the service industry I understand, shit happens. The food has always been worth it. They also have the yummy french vanilla creamer, not just the non dairy creamer. How can you go wrong with that???"}
{"text":"The food looked great my nephew had a huge double burger my niece the fried zucchini. The one thing that struck me as odd when we walked in was that the place was very smokey.  I've worked in restaurants before so there was either a ventilation problem or what I believe is they hadn't cleaned out the overhead filters they looked dirty.  my eyes were burning it's as if they were using charcoal briquettes indoors but they weren't.  I ordered the shrimp platter which seem to be ok until I ate my last one I remember it tasting odd but I blew it off in the morning I was nauseous and on the toilet diarrhea City I sit here with stomach cramps and fever I always support small businesses but this place sorry you guys need to clean it up. Good luck."}
{"text":"First the good...my salad was good and fresh. The bad, the girl that took my order was not at all friendly, I told her I needed some low carb options and she replied with \"uhhhh I dunno\". She wasn't polite and didn't even smile. The guy who gave me my order had the same depressing attitude. For a basic no frills garden salad and a medium drink I was surprised it was over $9. I might give them another try but their customer service sucks."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! We waited an HOUR for are meals. Four of us. They all come out 5 minutes apart. I had an omelet with burnt eggs, completely dry inside. I went up to ask for butter. The girl said ok then ignored me and started helping other customers. I had to ask the cook. My wife asked for a burrito with eggs, bacon and potato. It came with no bacon that we then had to wait another 5 minutes for. Horrible customer service, attitudes and food that definitely was not worth the money or the wasted time out of our life. Absolute sh!t hole. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Okay I never write reviews, but this place made me! I am so pissed! I come in for breakfast thought it looked good. Oh and by the way I from California. So we go in and I order a breakfast burrito with sausage. And my friend and I go sit down. It takes them 15 minutes to just bring me some damn orange juice! The waitress asks if I want some water, but I never get it! My friend gets her food before I get my drink which is weird! 10 minutes later I get my burrito, and it has bacon in stead of sausage! I look inside and there's chili in it! Not like pico de gallo chili, but like the chili you put on top of fries or eat with sour cream and cheese! EEWWW!  No, I'm sorry, you don't put that in a BREAKFAST burrito! It didn't even say on the menu that there is chili in it! So I didn't want confrontation so I try it, it was so disgusting! I wanted to throw up! It tasted like mush! So I ask the waitress 2 times if I can get something else! She doesn't even come to me, she stays at the other end of the room and yells at me to go handle it up front! I did not want to at all, I just wanted something else made that's all. So I go up front and the lady that took my order is so RUDE! She just stares at me as well as ell the cooks! And when I ask if I can get something different, she tells me that I need to pay $4 more dollars to just get some eggs, hash browns and pancakes! I already paid $8 just for the burrito and orange juice! Are you frekin kidding me!? So I go sit back down and the lady comes and gives me $6 back for the burrito, which is fine and all of the people dining in there are staring at me because if the situation! I was totally embarrassed I was pretty much in tears cause of how embarrassed I was and I'm 19! All I am is here for 1 week in Arizona visiting! I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN! And I advise no one else to go unless you want the poorest customer service ever!"}
{"text":"The fries are crispy and it seemed they have changed the burgers because it taste more like beef.  Pastrami looks pretty lean also!"}
{"text":"The Triple Bacon Avocado Green Chile Cheese Burger (was that even close to the real name) was out of bounds and out of control. It was likely the biggest burger in several surrounding zip codes. And de-lish-us!  The fries 'need' to be ordered extra, extra crispy.   The omelette was bad and then odd, and then bad again. I thought the menu said \"chile\" on top but it apparently said / meant \"chili\" on top. That was silly and just dumb. Hormel chili on an omelette? Is that a thing?"}
{"text":"Customer service is complete shit, especially the order taker lady. Food is good so it makes up for the shitty customer service."}
