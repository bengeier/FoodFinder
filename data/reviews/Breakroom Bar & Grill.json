{"text":"Service was great...The staff was very friendly. I came here to grab a bite to eat with some friends and shoot some pool and we had a great time!!! We just happened to show up on taco Tuesday and the carne Asada tacos were great!!!...I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The bar service is good. What sets this place apart from other bars is the kitchen. Junior hooks it up! The wings are amazing and everything else from the kitchen is amazing. I have never had a dish at this place that wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and beer. Friendly staff and fun atmosphere pool tables and regular people having a good time not pretentious in any way."}
{"text":"Dive bar hell yes, a good one i think not. Im a strong believer that if you dont feel comfortable then trust your gut. And thankfully mine was talking to me. I will give it credit as being more of a melting pot than i thought it would be. One night I went and from what a friend that stayed told me there was a gun pulled about thirty minutes after I left. That only backed up my initial thoughts because when I pulled up I was actually a little hesitant to get out the car because of all the activity in the parking lot paired with the stares and glares. Inside though I agree that I was impressed with the wide karaoke spectrum and talent also. The guys shooting pool were no joke either!!! Service wise my only gripe was that the bartender tried to make my drink so strong it wasnt what i ordered anymore. I appreciated the gesture and tipped accordingly but politely asked for another with less of the previous gesture lol. I didnt try the food but if i ever go back i surely will."}
{"text":"The Original Breakroom owner (Paul) bought it back and it will start opening again at 6am for breakfast...."}
{"text":"The bartender Mandy was top notch...the cocktails were expertly made & she was pleasant...not bad to look @ either! Plenty of tv's to watch the games...we had a nice time for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We're here a couple of times a month since my boyfriend likes to play darts and I like the varied selection on the jukebox. Adrian at the bar makes a powerful and fun drink called the Rusty Fox. And they also have local beers on tap. The fried zucchini and wings are always cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this bar while on business trip. Service is always amazing and although we rent a place in Scottsdale we will always come here. Krystal is a great bartender and never left us hanging. If your in AZ come for a drink and great food!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit at the bar. The drinks were nice. The environment was grown & sexy, relaxing, welcoming. My wife and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Krystal is awesome !!!  My favorite bar.. Great drinks ,Super prices.. Just did a drink called a ROLLERCOASTER!!  serious business. Great atmosphere to meet good people.."}
{"text":"Not only do I love this place the \"7days in a crack house\" made by Krystal is the sh*t. The wings is the truth to. Everything you order is amazing."}
{"text":"Nice crowd never been when it was packed....its  johnny's eastside now"}
{"text":"This is the spot for the greatest karaoke in the valley.  I haven't found a better selection anywhere.  The crowd can get very interesting, but everyone is quite friendly."}
{"text":"Okay, sure Breakroom is a little terrifying. It is in a seedy part of town, some colorful and incredibly drunk characters frequent there, and I certainly wouldn't go without a capable male in my party, but I like the Breakroom.

1. They have karaoke every night of the week. As someone who is bored to tears when I don't have a good excuse to yell during a night out, I am not fond of bars that DON'T do karaoke.

2. As far as karaoke books go, this is the best we have encountered. Huge selection filled with obscurities you won't find anywhere else and old favorites.

3. The crowd is always weird but down. Even if they all sing R&B, they still clap for the shit I sing and I have never gone without a lone hip girl praising me endlessly for spicing things up.

4. Cheap beer and the best pineapple upside -down cake shot in town. 

5. There are TWO working stalls in the ladies room. One is intensely tiny with no lock on the door, but if you are in it then no one could open the door anyway (see told you it was tiny). Nicole T.'s memory may have been clouded by  double vodka on the rocks. But both of the stalls work.

The host are a little iffy, and generally beg for tips far too much, but it has always been a good time and is consistently our fall back should karaoke somewhere else suck or be canceled. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to hang!  Excellent staff and food- will come back soon!!! We had pizza and drinks"}
{"text":"The service was great from all the staff, mandy, craystal and the cook Milo. Great food and service."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?? 
1. The bartenders are friendly. Tonight Megan was personable, attentive, & killin it.
2. Jason the new cook just raised the wings to a whole nother level. They stayed crisp to the last wing. That sauce tho!! Those fries all crispy and delicious.
3. The people that come here are real. Come sit at the bar and by the end of the night you're all homies.
You wanna feel like you're part of a community, hit this place up. 
P.S. They have a touch tunes jukebox you can control from your barstool. BAM!"}
{"text":"The food was great but it was very frustrating that the drinks and kitchen are separate. It does not make sense that we could not pay for everything on one tab. The business needs to figure out that one of the companies pays out the other...etc."}
{"text":"Ive frequented this place a few times food is ok for a dive however there have been times ive gone in there and it smelled like urine. Beer is always cold though so theres that, service can be hit or miss however i think it depends on the bartenders mood."}
{"text":"Great service here, cheap prices and the food is amazing.  The kitchen is leased out and the food prices are reasonable.  My favorite dive bar in Phoenix when i am in town."}
{"text":"Thats right 5... One of the best dive bars I have ever been to... Food is awesome and  CHEAP!!! Free pool during most days, at least every day that i have been...STRONG drinks!! CHEAP beer!! What else do you want??? BEST OF ALL, Sign on the wall says \"NO TWEEKERS\"!!!!  Classic...."}
{"text":"The Breakroom could be considered the home bar for the dregs from your local DMV or nearby Walmart.  Not real pretty, a little scary for the weak, rough around the edges, but real nevertheless.  I met up with Max and his bevy of beauties for Thursday night karaoke - bulletproof vest optional. 

Yes, the bar is dumpy with caved in ceilings, classroom lighting, broken ceiling fans and probably hasn't changed since 1982, but the Bacardi cokes were $2. Two. Dollars. WTF?!  The song list here was extensive - one of the larger lists akin to George and Dragon.  The crowd was all over the place as others mentioned and got noticeably younger as the night went on.

The emcee was friendly and cool and roamed the room with his wireless mike while he noshed on a make-me-vomit value meal from McDonalds.  He was a decent emcee until he decided to sing Freedom 90 with me and totally screw it up with his deep gravelly voice - nearly drowning my seasoned, tried and true rendition. 

I probably won't go back for karaoke unless Max (bevy of beauties in tow) and/or my Mafioso cousins from the Bay Area are with me."}
{"text":"It's not the Star Wars bar exactly, but it does have an interesting variety of people. Oh how I long to go to a bar that is even more similar to the Star Wars bar.....

I had a good time at Breakroom for multiple reasons. First, I was with a group of fellow Yelpers, and they were really fun to hang out with. Second was the bartender Jessica was fantastic, I couldn't drink that night, so I just had a couple non-alcoholic drinks. Jessica refused to charge me a dime, very cool. Third was the people watching. There was a lot of people watching material in this place. If you want to see what I am talking about, go see it for yourself. Fourth was the karaoke. The good ones were great to listen to, and the bad ones were hilarious. 

This place is in desperate need of a makeover, in fact at one point were we trying to figure out what was the most urgently in need of an extreme makeover. The bathrooms are vile, period. Can somebody call that Ty Pennington guy maybe?

There is fun to be had here with friends, but ladies, I don't recommend going alone."}
{"text":"A little bit of a dive bar but I come here primarily to shoot pool. A little rough around the edges but supporters of O-sports (Ohio State and Oregon) hang out here so it feels like home in some ways."}
{"text":"Great friendly bartender in a cool dive bar. The DJ absolutely sucks! My grand kids have a better karaoke machine.The music goes tolerable to intolerably loud in seconds."}
{"text":"Sports bar. Good crowd for a Saturday afternoon so that says something about the place. They have one large TV screen plus a bunch of smaller ones, 4 pool tables and 3 dart boards. Nothing fancy but the food was very good. I got the pastrami sandwich with onion rings. I bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate to try out the place. I thought $3 for a soda was a little much."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot, but it seems to have gone downhill recently. Bartenders ignore you, patrons hoard tables, and it is just generally not much fun anymore. Too bad."}
{"text":"Great dive bar! Polite bartenders and some interesting drink specials. The food is phenomenal and portions are extremely generous. Only dive bar in Phoenix serving Pinot Grigio :-) Drinks and food are reasonably priced. Four well-kept pool tables, three dart boards and karaoke encourages hours of fun.  Love this bar!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  The prices are so reasonable we had a hard time spending all $22 of our voucher!  I had the Cinnamon Toast Crunch dring (there is also a shot) and the Liquid Marijuana.  Both were good, but 'tis the season for cinnamon and that one really hit the spot.  The Bartender was on point handling everyone who came in, with ease.  We sat at the bar and never had to worry about asking for a fresh drink.  Excellent.  We ordered the Sampler Platter Appetizer with 5 items ($9.50) it was out quickly with a huge cup of ranch.  It could have fed 5 people!  You order food here directly from the kitchen, and the cook was very nice, too.  Later the owner (?) arrived and he went about talking to all of the guests.  

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice pool Hall with exceptional service. They were having karaoke which was quite entertaining. Played a few rounds of pool with some old friends and had some reasonably priced drinks. When I make my way back to Phoenix I will definitely stop in here again everyone was very friendly the bar staff was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm so white I'm not even sure I should be reviewing this place but I'm gonna anyway.

My friend did not warn me beforehand about what this place was like. We pulled up & there was a group of black people standing around outside. We parked & I knew there was some shady happenings going on behind the bar. I start thinking \"Omg, what is my friend getting me into? Where's my pepper spray? Oh, I hope it works if I have to use it.\" I soon realized that everything was going to be ok! It turned out great.

Besides the 2 female bartenders (1 was quite pregnant but still busting her ass), a girl with her boy friend, her sister, & 2 gay guys I was the only other white person there. It doesn't even matter though. The vibe is crazy drunk happy. The women are large & in charge! They all sing along to the karaoke songs they know. No, scratch that... they grind, dance, & shake their stuff all over each other while singing."}
{"text":"Great vibe and good times! Was here on a Tuesday of all nights. Karaoke and pool. Great group fun or if you single and ready to mingle. Gotta eat the chicken wings, Moses style! Tonya the Bartender and JR the cook."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this bar tonight and I definitely recommend it! It had a great environment. Krystal was the bartender and did a fabulous job. The customer service was amazing and I plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic neighborhood/dive bar. The staff is super friendly, drinks are great, the food is delicious and very reasonably priced! Don't miss their wings and reuben. Great place to watch football - plenty of TVs, including a projected screen. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been here to many times to count over the years and just never thought to Yelp it because it is just such a nice hiding spot. It is a larger neighbor hood bar where most everyone knows each other. 

They have plenty of televisions, and a very large area to play pool. The bar is a bar! It has everything you could want unless you are making six figures a year and want something crazy. If you are looking for short skirts, loud music, and $12 drinks, this is not the spot for you. 

If you want to just relax and post up to a bar, check it out."}
{"text":"The Breakroom is a dive bar. But it is a five star dive bar! We took advantage of the $30 for $50 deal on Yelp and went in for our anniversary dinner because of the deal and how close it was to our hotel. There was karaoke going and a batchelorette party was taking full advantage and not don't a bad job. Latoya was behind the bar and we were served promptly and welcomed genuinely. She expertly mixed and poured us a few drinks, all of them very nicely done. Then we ordered off the bar menu. That's when we met Peter. Peter should be wearing a crisp set of chef's whites turning out $40 plates. I had the Philly cheese steak with onion rings which he apologized beforehand for having to hand cut and dip. The sandwich was perfection and the onion rings tasted like the person who invented onion rings intended them to taste. My wife had the Patty melt... Fresh, hand pressed patty seasoned beyond perfection. As if that wasn't enough the price was insanely cheap for the quality even without the deal. So yeah, it's a dive, but after only a short visit,. The Breakroom is our dive from here on out. Do yourself a favor and go see for yourself."}
{"text":"Nice dive with a great bartender. Toya will give you sass but somehow she keeps you wanting more"}
{"text":"It's a friendly dive bar. Pool and darts and beer no extras. I have never eaten here."}
{"text":"Was not a what I expected.. I love dive bars but did not feel safe at this one.. People hanging in the parking lot. Watching women doing drugs in the restroom as we played pool.. Not cool"}
{"text":"Friendliest place in town....I've never seen a cook come out of the kitchen and ask if you would like anything and be so polite and fix you whatever. What a proactive place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here bc it was listed on the Crafty Bastards list but when I asked the bartender about it she had no idea. They do have a few local beers in bottles. Couple on draft but nothing to really applaud."}
{"text":"My Dad and I stopped in the other day , it was early they had just opened. Jason asked if we were ready for breakfast and we ordered the #2 breakfast. 10 min. later he put 2 giant platters in front of us. WOW what a meal , Eggs bacon hash browns and biscuts and gravy for $6.00. Everything was hot, fresh, and out a this world good. I am a breakfast kinda guy and from now on when I want a great breakfast I'm going to the Breakroom. It's one of the best bar & grill anywhere."}
{"text":"Yup. A hole in the wall bar had a phenomenal bone in ribeye. YOU HEARD ME. On Sundays this is a special and it is completely worth it.  From the perfect temp that it was cooked(I asked for rare) to the potato with the trimmings. Seriously, I have never given a sports 5stars cause I'm never SHOCKED. l was shocked. Nice and dark bar with darts and pool tables. Did I mention THE BONE IN RIBEYE ?!?!?"}
{"text":"Wow, can't believe these reviews.
This place is nothing but a dive bar.
The food listed on this site is 95% fiction.
A few sandwiches, a few burgers, and frozen wings, oh and nachos.

Tonight, I had to go to the kitchen and order my club sandwich and then I had to retrieve my sandwich from said kitchen.
Had 3 drinks and not once was I asked if I would like another on. I had to go to the bar and get my own drinks.
So just shy of making my sandwich and pouring my own drinks I should have been tipped.

Weak at best."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite awhile maybe since last year. 
This is my go-to hole in the wall spot when I want a mix of people. It is majority black but white people do make appearance to hang out and play pool. Their is never any trouble each time I've come and the atmosphere resembles a family reunion type. (Even though I never know anyone) 
A hole in the wall bar is NOT a bad thing and sometimes offer the best experiences and less uptight people. 

 The drinks aren't bad I usually stick to beers and bottles. You can expect the drinks to come out like most hole in the wall spots. They do on alot of occasions have drink specials on the good liquor not the cheap stuff. So it's important you ask, I would recommend they get a outside board to advertise it though. I would HIGHLY recommend more engagement from the bartenders, and asking patrons if they need another drink. 

The music is mostly hip-hop and R&B, but karaoke can change that. Speaking of karaoke this bar offers that and it's really engaging because it's led by a woman named Tylissa who play DJ. She keeps the energy in the bar positive, live and uplifting through the mic. Everyone will engage if you have fun with it. It's a non-judgemental atmosphere. 
The bar does offer 3-4 dart boards with the cameras and 4 nice pool tables. Pool tables ARE the go to fun! 
I haven't had the food, so I cannot add to that, this review is based on my experience and drinks. 

No matter what color you are, you are welcomed at this hole in the wall  bar! Go and have fun!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were in town from Buffalo for a work conference and were at work events all week. We were celebrating my 21st birthday and in search of a fun Karaoke bar and we found The Breakroom!  The staff, the cheap drinks, and the atmosphere the were all amazing! We had a great time and are very happy to have found such a down to earth place to celebrate. Thank you to the owner, karaoke dj's and the bartender for a great time. :)"}
{"text":"i decently priced bar with surprisingly good food for a great price. free pool during the weekdays and a galaga cab alongside a good pinball machine (if they get it fixed lol)

the sandwiches are killer, good stuff here. definitely not for people who are used to quiet bars though"}
{"text":"My sister and I met here for HH because I had a a late doctor appt right across the 202 on 44th St. The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but it has a casual and friendly atmosphere. I would consider it a dive bar, but we love those! The cute female bartender was especially nice and talkative, keeping up on our INEXPENSIVE drinks. They didn't have much on the menu we could eat since we are both avoiding certain foods, but we may try something another time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is on point, the crowd is fun and energetic plus they have billards which is a plus"}
{"text":"Possibly the best bar I have been to in Phoenix. If you're looking for a chill hole in the wall place with friendly staff, and great bar food, this is it! Always sure to be a place to meet interesting people, and have a good time after a long days work! Check it out! The manager is super sweet, and the food will not disappoint. Even the chef came out to take our order! For sure worth a stop in!"}
{"text":"Despite all of the \"glowing\" (insert sarcasm) reviews about this place, some friends and I decided that this would be a great spot for happy hour.  Just as I was told, I saw a drug deal going down within my first 5 minutes of being there, at 5:30 PM.  There were lots of blue collar workers just getting off work and relaxing.  Everyone seemed to just be enjoying their Friday night.  Some other reviewers said they didn't exactly feel safe, but I felt pretty safe, however I did have a large group of guys with me.  The drinks were cheap, darts were fun.  The clientel was not my favorite, karaoke SUCKED...the PA system was awful and kept cutting out and almost everyone there wanted to sing R&B or rap...nothing against the two, I just like some variety in my ear-splitting karaoke.  Oh, and the folding table covered by a tent smoking area was pure class all the way.  I appreciate the experience but don't think I'll be going back.  I love dives, just not this one."}
{"text":"I'll preface this as a guy who just moved here to phoenix from Orange County, CA. 
A fantastic neighborhood type bar!  They carry a solid selection of IPA's, a few AZ beers (Scottsdale blonde and Kilt Lifter) and the regulars on tap. Wide ranging excellent selection of all types spirits.  Pretty good standard bar style food. Latoya and Krystal are fantastic bartenders; gracious, attentive, and personable; they take of all their customers. Kareoke Thurs - Sun; Electronic darts; 4 pool tables ($5 9-ball tournaments on Sundays are fun). NFL and NHL PASS (to watch my Anaheim Ducks) definitely make it worth it. Always an enjoyable time when I drop in!"}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday and it was pretty empty, so Im assuming more people come on the weekends. The chicken wings I ordered were slighty hard, and tasted like they were microwaved. Other than that, it was a cool spot."}
{"text":"For the location of this bar, I honestly do not think it is that bad. It is certainly not a happening Scottsdale bar, but I have been here twice and really enjoyed myself both times.

The bar is awesome for karaoke. They have a great selection of songs, and there are always plenty of people there to sing away. You have some good, some bad, just like any other place. Both times I went were on a Saturday and everyone in my party had the chance to sing multiple times without a long wait.

The drinks are well priced and I have never had to wait that long.

They have a few pool tables and two electronic dart boards in addition to Karaoke.

I thought the point of Yelp was to review things for what they are. If this bar was in Scottsdale, it would be a different story, but its at 48th Street and McDowell and its a Dive Bar. As far as dive bars go... it is definitely a 4 in  my books."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good dive bar? I know I do! 

I was a little sketchy about checking it out, as I had been meaning to for some time now, but kept making excuses not to go. 

I gotta say, I had a blast last friend with Georgeann G. at the Breakroom. Bartender Maria was great and the karaoke was awesome. Those who know me, know I DO NOT sing karaoke, but something about this place, or the amount of vodka I consumed OR Georgeann signing me up without my prior consent, made me do it. It was a great time had by all. The staff is great, the drinks are cheap, and the customers are friendly. 

The only suggestion that I can give, and I will bump it up to 5 stars if it happens...... SHUFFLE BOARD!!! Bring in a shuffle board and all will be well!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty ghetto. It's filled with mostly regulars - some of the most diverse crowd you'll ever see. There are literally crack-whores, ex convicts and drug dealers at this place - and yet it's harmless. True to its name, this place is great if you like to play pool. There's 4 tables and pretty much always someone looking for a game. This place also has a modern juke box, more than 7 televisions with NFL Ticket, pinball, darts, and every night at 9 they run Karaoke all night. Tuesdays they run a free poker tournament through goallininc.com. 

The joint is in need of a makeover, but it's not completely awful. It's actually very comfortable. That's why I've given it 3 stars. It's warm and inviting there... plus, the drinks are cheap and the food is good (for bar food) and super cheap. If you want to hit up karaoke, it's usually a pretty safe crowd and it's a lot of fun. Bring a group of friends. 

It's a perfect place to go when you don't feel like getting dressed up or impressing anyone. It's not like going to TT Roadhouse where it's packed and everyone looks at a non-regular like they are an alien. It's also not like going to Jugheads where it can be dark and scary if you're not a regular. Breakroom is the kind of place where it's just really easy to walk in as a non-regular and belly up to the bar and order a pint. Don't let the crackwhores and pimps scare you off. And don't let the fact that it's a bit of a dump turn you off... or do."}
{"text":"Best pool hall in town... The service was exceptional!! Krystal is the best bartender EVER!!! I will definitely come back to this bar! Oh and btw, the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ummm... What can I say about this place. It could be one of the most dangerous looking places, and the crowd, hmm could be scary, BUT (big but) I felt pretty save here. Perhaps it is the drug dealers that keep it safe. I don't know, but I dig it. Sometimes you have to get gritty, and see the other side of the tracks, it keeps you real and grounded. Now I wouldn't go here often, but it's nice to hit a real dive up every now and then. This place has thousands of stories to tell, and each patron just as many. I tried to determine who had the most stories to tell, it was a toss up between the old drunk cowboy in the red satin \"Five and Dimes\" jacket, or the nice looking Mexican man in the \"I have a big roost\" shirt.  Too me, this place is a short story haven, or if you need inspiration for characterization in writing, go here. These are real people, gritty, grimy and somewhat scary, but real. We don't have much reality in Phoenix, but the Breakroom is as real as it gets. I give it 2 stars, because it is truely a DIVE!"}
{"text":"It's all about a good bartender!  Latoya will make you feel at home from the minute you walk in!  And they have a great cheeseburger too!  Highly recommend this place for a chill evening of dinner, drinks, and pool!"}
{"text":"Had a awesome time. Adrian was a very sweet bartender and we had no problems with redeeming our coupon. The cook was great and the vibe was good. Even got to know a few people. Everyone was friendly. Only one bad thing we had so much fun I am paying the price today. Lol We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"wow...New York City, Chicago, LA...could have been any one of these cities inside this friendly bar. Definitely a mix! Melting pot of working America, different backgrounds, races, incomes...(no Ferraris in parking lot)...Tanya was great bartender and works most nights, a real gem, friendly, warm, and even carries a tune Karaoke as she pours drinks! Country is her sound. A lot of regulars I figured out after almost not going in...but once in... they all were friendly too me. Pool tables with tournaments on wed, sat, and Sunday, tables were in great shape, they said the owner was a state pool champ and loves his pool tables. Dart boards were not in use but looked new. Chilled glass with my draft beer, tried \"the bomb\" burrito, can be shared, large, 6.00, really good, beans, beef, toms, lettuce, onions, sour cream, excellent salsa, and covered in cheese, what a deal, but need BIG appetite. Karaoke host was nice and organized, a lot of talented singers in phoenix, Charles was really good doing easten Corbin, another guy was raised in choir and had all applauding after \"Mrs Jones\", told my wife she should go, just go in group if all ladies as I felt fine after settling in, has a lot of TVs and one large projector screen, like 8' x 8'...don't let this REAL human storybook scare you away, 
a
must read!  4-stars for sure, enjoy!"}
{"text":"We're karaoke enthusiasts, so were in search of a great local bar. This place is awesome. Casual, friendly, food, beer, pool and music. The staff are great!"}
{"text":"The drinks were cheap, the music was good, and the company was great. The bar is in a sketchy area of town but don't let that deter you, the staff and patrons are very friendly."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks on happy hour and great women bartenders. They have tons of pool tables and dart boards. Great place to come and hangout with some friends or solo."}
{"text":"This place is called East Side now ... but still shows up on my blackberry as The Breakroom.  They even still have signs inside the bar referring to it as The Breakroom. 

Its really not as scary as it looks from the outside.  But I will admit it does look at bit scary from the outside.  The 'no tweeker' sign is awesome :) Its a big place with lots of pool tables and apparently good karaoke, although I was not there for that.  The bartenders were really nice and you could tell everyone in there was having a good time.  We drank rootbeer barrels (although the bartender didn't know what they were she was really nice at trying to make one for us) 

$1 PBR on Sundays! And other really great specials throughout the week. *** and they even have hooks under the bar for your purse*** totally won me over with that... such a necessity but such a hard thing to find in dives."}
{"text":".... where the deer and the antelope, and the cowboy, and the old fart, and the cholo, and the crack ho, and the cool NY bartender, and the karaoke star, and the parolee all plaaaayyy!

Seriously, this place is a melting pot... a United Nations of the thirsty, hungry, and hungover.  At first, I was afraid that at any moment some kind of fight was bound to break out.
Nope, everyone seemed to know everyone. I'm sure if I were able to visit more, I'd get to hug and air-kiss that cool bartender too!

We visited this place a couple of times during our visit, and at both times I felt both comfortable and nervous. Now, that's a real dive bar for ya. I kid, I kid.  
Although this place is indeed a dive, they serve food - burgers, pizza, cheese crisps (open-faced quesadilla, or Mexican pizza as I like to call it), deep fried mushrooms, fries, etc... Oldman had a chili-cheese burger, which was just the right size and messy, but not too messy - a two-napkin kind of burger. I had a deluxe cheese crisp, and I have to say, I don't know why I haven't made my quesadillas this way (topped with mushrooms, red peppers, and onion). They have a few pool tables, which were always in use, and Karaoke EVERY night. If you're in the area, I recommend checking this place out, especially if the NY bartender gal is working!"}
{"text":"Meghan and Jason are the best things that could've happened to The Breakroom!  Jason can cook like no one else. No matter what you order it will come out legit, tasty, fresh and with a smile. Meghan is the best!  She delivers drinks with a smile and is genuine and approachable. Promise!! I used to be afraid of this place, now I feel at home!"}
{"text":"Great drinks properly made music food and karaoke regulars are known to be here multiple days of the week very close with owner family like I typically go for or on occasions"}
{"text":"Awesome Karaoke songbook, cheap drinks, and colorful characters to be found at the Breakroom. 

This place is a hidden gem for Karaoke lovers if you can deal with the diveyness of the place. Yes, the place is a little seedy and in major need of a facelift, but honestly worth it if you have a serious need to get your sing on. 

There is a small rotation, usually just 5 or 6 people even on a busy Saturday night - I think I got the chance to sing 8 or 9 songs last night. The host pre-programs a chunk of songs and walks away, so be prepared to grab the microphone the second you hear your song come on with no intro.

The crowd is a melting pot and the song choices reflect that. A little Marvin Gaye followed by Blink 182 followed by some rap song I never heard followed by Michael Jackson sung by some white guy with a Michael Bolton hair-do.  

As for the bathroom, the whole place is a little dumpy, so I'm not sure what other reviewers were expecting. A towel valet perhaps? The toilets flushed and there was hand soap and towels so I consider myself lucky."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Reminds me of my favorite dive bars back home! Food is excellent too."}
{"text":"Always homeless people in the parking lot giving people a hard time. Drinks were ok but a little watered down. Had to drink double what I normally do! I ordered something to eat and found a hair!! Not ok.."}
{"text":"Dodgy. Sketchy. Shady. Skeevy. Whatever you call it, it's all the same and it's at the Breakroom. 

Rodeo was on TV. Awful tone-deaf people were singing. I'm sure many a deal was happenin' too. Here's one place you're sure to score. 

But, c'mon, it's not THAT scary. Granted, I ain't going by myself. But in a group or with a friend, this place is fine. They serve drinks just like anywhere else. 

Only thing unique and vastly different about the Breakroom is that their patrons are bonafide true-blue people probably dealin' with real-life issues - not broken nails, bikini waxes or studly tans. Their stories are written all over their faces, and let me tell ya, after reading a chapter, I wanted nothing more than to put the book down and walk away."}
{"text":"The bartender Krystal was great!  The cook even came out and talked to me.  The place made me feel like I was welcome and home.  The pool tournaments they have have on Monday  Wednesday and Friday are great!  I had a great Time!"}
{"text":"Business owner reached out and was extremely apologetic/will fix the issue. 5 stars for good service"}
