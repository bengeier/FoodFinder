{"text":"This place is definitely not your ordinary pizza place. Wow!!! Love at first Bite!

The name goes with the pizza. The crust was nice and Crisp, and you can tell they use quality ingredients 

I would definitely recommend checking this place out! I now have a new favorite pizza place in the valley."}
{"text":"Really good pizza made by people who care about the culinary experience that you have when you eat their food!"}
{"text":"I can't rave about this place enough. It is the pizza of my dreams - literally!! This so rates a cheat meal if there ever was one - forget about any other pizza place EVER!  Brought a pie to my very picky mother in law (won't eat out anywhere) and she has asked me twice to bring more because it reminds her of the pizza she ate as a kid. No higher praise! You won't be sorry you stopped in to CRISP!"}
{"text":"Love love. We are from New York and this is the most amazing grandma pizza we've had.  00 floor, pecorino romano, amazing sauce, light crispy crust. You will not be disappointed and we are picky"}
{"text":"Wow.... kinda sums it up!  Really great pizza.  A nice change to all the average restaurants I've been to in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this pizza since we read so many good reviews. The pizza was disappointing and I think over priced at $30 per pizza. There is barely any cheese to speak of making this more like bread with tomato sauce and toppings. The crust was crisp, which was nice. The next day I put 8 oz of mozzarella cheese on the half of pizza we had leftover which made it better, but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm so happy with this place! I tried it a long time ago when it was something else, and never came back. I noticed the remodel was going on, and saw it's open now. First off, it's beautiful inside. Then the pizza...it's the best I've had! I can't wait to come back. I'm so glad this is a new owner. I work in old Town, so it's nice to have a place I can get a slice for me, or a whole pizza for the office."}
{"text":"This is THE best pizza I have ever had ! The crust it with out a doubt the best! Light and fluffy and crisp on the bottom! I ordered a cheese, pepperoni and a veggie pizza. Even my one year old was ripping pizza ! She loved it ! Adrian and his wife  made it feel spot on with the hospitable service. We will defiantly be back when we're in town again! We're from Las Vegas & come to Scottsdale a lot & stumbled across this place shopping. What a great find! MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the Old Town area. I tried it recently, and I thought the food was really good. All of the pizzas are square in size, either a pan or as a slice size. The prices are reasonable considering the quality of the bread. I enjoyed it. I would highly recommend it if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Don't want be a dramatic Yelper, but.....

This pizza was incredibly underwhelming. It was comparable to Pizza Hut crust and didn't appear to be cooked enough (toppings and all). When we asked for water, staff said they didn't have ice and told us we'd have to drink warm tap water. Minutes later when we bought bottled water, he asked if we wanted ice to go with it. Strange. 

This is definitely one of those highly rated yelp reviews that I can't help but question."}
{"text":"The pizza was absolutely amazing, you can taste the freshness of The ingredients every single time you take a bite. Besides the pizzas amazing Crisp feeling you feel the love and energy in ever slice of the pie. The owner is a wonderful person with a strong passion for serving up the best pizza with a nice smile. This is coming from a New Yorker born in the Bronx, I've hit every notable pizza place in New York, and the only place in Scottsdale that is comparable to the best pizza I've ever had is Crisp"}
{"text":"Stopped by this afternoon, grabbed a couple slices and they were legit.  Definitely gonna add this place to the rotation.  Parking in Old Town sucks but it was worth it....."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza and even more incredible people. Bana and Adrian are awesome. I posted a complaint about service I received when I called in on busy Superbowl Sunday and they literally took the time to call me, listen and understand the situation and truly take it as constructive feedback. How rare is customer service like that? 

Crisp is an amazing addition to the Old Town food scene. Affordable and great for bringing dates to or just stopping by for a slice."}
{"text":"The owners Adrian and Vonna are from New York and are Awesome and the pizza is the best I've ever eaten! Great ambience in their little place and I recommend Highly. Great experience. I will come again all the way from Utah for that pizza! Yo Adrian!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is really really good. Nice clean space. A little pricey though. You get a pizza with three items and your over 40 bucks!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place!!!! They have the tastiest, crispiest crust I ever had!!!! I love the fresh, tasty sauce and cheese!! The sauce was one of the best! We will be back very soon, must have! Also the owners and staff are so kind and friendly! :) they introduced themselves and we talked about our dogs for a while:) we will definitely be back ASAP!!!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza. Ordered the traditional without additional toppings. We wanted to try it basic. As others stated the crust is thicker yet crisp. So good we did not want to stop eating. This is a must try, whether you order a whole pizza or by the slice. Adrian is working hard to be a memorable experience. We will be regulars"}
{"text":"Great pizza, unique concept, cool location, and all at a very reasonable price. Just what I was looking for while in the area for a day and walking around. Enjoyed visiting with the owner"}
{"text":"VERY VERY GOOD PIZZA!  OMG, tried this place the other day and was impressed with how fresh the ingredients were.  Pepperoni tasted amazing.  Went back the next week and tried the Pepperoni and Sausage...again amazing. Glad to have found this little gem right in my backyard from work!  Met the owner Adrian and he take personal pride in each pizza he makes.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, premium ingredients. If the Michelin Guide reviewed pies, Crisp is the one for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This pizza is definitely unusual. First off, it's square! Not a rectangle either. Square! It has a satisfyingly crunchy bottom crust, that justified the name crisp pizza. The dough is light and airy. It is closest to a sicilian crust, but not as thick. The sauce has a more fresh \"raw\" flavor than a traditional NY style pie. They finish every pie with fresh basil leaves and a squirt of extra virgin olive oil. A very cool touch.

I tried to order a small pie with half meatball, half mushroom. They said they could only do half and half on large pies. That confused me. I was taught that in the restaurant business, there is always a path to saying yes. And doing a half and half pie is such a normal thing in a pizzeria, I was momentarily stumped.

When I said that for the right price anything in a restaurant should be doable, they replied that the register wasn't set up for it. In the end they find a way to ring it up. $18 and change. To the owner: add a half and half small pizza option to your register please. It's definitely doable! Even if there is a small upcharge for the extra labor. 

The mushrooms weren't special at all. I've had some fantastic mushrooms at other joints. The sauce dominated any flavor they might have had, but eating one solo didn't impress.

But the Meatballs! Oh yes! I struggle to find a good new york style meatball anywhere in Arizona. But these nailed it! NY style pizza meatballs are not crumbled beef. They aren't balls or half balls of meat. They aren't small. They are supposed to be flat disks, like large pepperoni. And you should see herbs or garlic in every delicious slice. Crisp's meatballs hit the mark! In the photo, you can clearly see the delicious garlic sparkling in every one.

I liked the music and the cool garage-door store-front. The tables are communal style. They are only open till ten on the weekends, so there won't be any after bar socializing at those tables."}
{"text":"Delicious grandma style pizza! You won't be disappointed!! I would highly suggest checking it out."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza! We loved that this pizza was the best of both worlds: crispy bottom but still has that fluffy doughy bite. You can tell they use quality ingredients. They really have perfected the pizza here, only con is I wish it was closer to where I live ;) I'd rank this as one of my top pizza places in the valley!"}
{"text":"Yum!  We visited Crisp after reading the great reviews on Yelp and the pizza certainly did not disappoint!  We ordered 2 slices of meatball and spinach and 2 slides of meatball and onion - unique, tasty and quite filling too!  The owners were welcoming, warm and good with recommendations.  There is not a lot of seating, so plan ahead for your visit."}
{"text":"Just finished eating crisp and I am appalled. I have no doubt that this pizza is straight from the frozen isle at the local grocery store, i.e., Digornos. Unless you enjoy snacking on cloves of garlic, DO NOT order the white pizza. On top of horrible tasting pizza, horrible service can be found at crisp as well. Heating up this sad excuse for a pizza took over an hour, so yes you would expect something hot and tasty at the end of this long waiting period, but that is far from what I got."}
{"text":"Great new little shop. Everything slice is fresh, and the best crust I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"So good! Perfect amount for dinner. Crisp bottom but soft and just doughy enough on the top. I will go here again!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and surper nice staff. The crust is thick but not dense, so you can just keep eating! The pie size is huge and enough for 3 or more easily."}
{"text":"This pizza place is such a great find in Old Town Scottsdale! The pizza was stellar with very fresh ingredients! The atmosphere is very laid back with bench seating. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our reputation as a mecca for pizza continues to grow and Crisp certainly adds to the legend.  This is almost a new category (Grandma style) and it doesn't fall under the normal classifications (Neapolitan, Chicago, Standard New York, etc...) that dominate our landscape.

The crispy, buttery crust is the star of this show and it is closely followed by some incredible, tangy tomato sauce.  Some might complain that your piece isn't drowning in cheese and that is ok because the two aforementioned items make the experience special.  Pizza has become a multifaceted affair around here and Crisp is just one more wonderful way to explore the dish."}
{"text":"Crisp is a gem! You will not find better. Adrian and Bona have created a pizza paradise! From the OO flour and the extensive curing of the dough to the sauce (so good you could drink) and best cheeses... mozzarella and pecorino, you have the foundation of the best pizza you will find... and we've been to the nationally recognized pizzerias in New Haven, New York and Chicago. I grew up on my grandma's pizza and she would be proud of what Crisp has done. Congratulations!"}
{"text":"Great great great!! This is great pizza like mama used to make. This is a must try if you in town visiting. Fresh pizza, fresh ingredients and the owners are amazing!! You won't be disappointed. We had the pepperoni and the meat Delux. Loved both!!!"}
{"text":"It's a small place, not much to it. Good crispy crust if you like it thick though. I prefer the thin crispy style. Ingredients are fresh but for a 4.5 star pizza place I was expecting more than just bottled drinks and thick crust pizza. Service was good. I should have read more into the reviews. Considering competition nearby I'm giving it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype was about - the crust was good but not like INCREDIBLE, and the sauce and toppings were very unremarkable. The shop is clean and pleasant to eat in, I just didn't find the actual pizza to be worth the hype."}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed my two visits to Crisp.  The owner, Adrian, is a really friendly guy and is committed to serving a great product.

The main thing that sets Crisp apart is the crust.  It's light and fluffy but has a nice crisp side on the bottom that provides texture.  The meats, cheese, tomatoes and olive oil are all sourced from top-notch providers.

I usually order a square of pepperoni and a square of sausage.  That's enough for a meal and the cost is reasonable."}
{"text":"Mehhhh this place really did not live up to the hype.  Our pizza was really tasteless and soggy.  I think it's because they just use plain tomato sauce instead of marinara.  The toppings tasted fresh, but it was overall masked by the soggy soggy dough.  Definitely not worth the $35 it cost."}
{"text":"I don't do reviews often, but sometimes something is so horrible that you just have to warn others to stay away. This was the absolute worst pizza I have ever had. Imagine a giant crouton that is both over cooked and under baked at the same time, add as little toppings as possible, then cover with a thin layer of flavorless sauce. If that sounds good then go for it, otherwise I would recommend going to literally any other pizza place in town."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and saw the reviews on this place, so decided to visit. The owner was super friendly and accommodating. Our whole experience was pleasant and we might make another trip back here before we leave! The owner even gave us a generous sample while we waited for our order to go...can't say enough about his customer service and pride in his product, but it is obvious in the pizza...delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We came here because of the Yelp reviews, and it lived up to our expectations entirely. The sauce is the best we have ever tasted! Highly recommend the ricotta pizza."}
{"text":"Love this pizza!  Ingredients are fresh and as the name says, the pizza is crispy.  This shop is right by where I work and it's so convenient to stop in for a slice at lunch or bring home a whole pizza at the end of the work day.  
The owner is very helpful and nice, the place is clean and inviting.  Definitely a 5 star pizza place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here last night for a  slice with my girlfriend. I ordered the white slice with mushroom and she had the original slice . You can truly taste the love and quality that goes into the pie , starting with the crust up to the cheese, toppings and spices .  It's hard to choose a favorite from the two slices . 

The white had a wonderful garlic flavor that gets smoothed over by the creaminess of the fresh ricotta that's very satisfying. 

The original slice has a delicious tomato sauce that's bright red and very fresh as if they pluck the tomatoes and crush them fresh for every slice . It's all about the crust though . You can taste the love in the dough that's used . No corners have been cut in these square slices . 

We've been here one other time and the owner is great . He told us his back story and how he came to Scottsdale and his love of pizza . He came around the counter and brought us garlic , red pepper and napkins . I don't know many owners who would put that kind of attentiveness to customers . You  can tell he's an honest and genuine dude and it comes through in his food .   If you're in the area stop in for a slice and see what REAL quality pie is all about."}
{"text":"As a TRUE New Yorker who frequents Scottsdale often, I can solemnly say that this is the BEST pizza by FAR in all of Arizona. Seriously. Don't waste your time, go grab a pie, AND THANK ME LATER!!! Crisp is definitely doing NYC justice!"}
{"text":"Heard we had Grandma slices in Old Town. Had to travel over to see this for myself. Now, Sal's in Gilbert has the true grandma slice. And you people without a Grandmother straight from Italy are not ones to judge. Grandma slices were made with leftover dough, sauce and very little cheese. Because families were poor and did not waste. As a matter of fact, my great-grandmother, who did not speak English, kept these \"tomato pies\", as she called them, in a drawer in her kitchen. We found that strange, even then. But we sure ate them. Oh, back to this place. It was a good attempt, but a true grandma slice is not dry and crispy on the bottom, it is soft and sweet. This was a good attempt. If my grandmother was alive I would have her make me some right now. Because it is that good. So, go here if you're in Old Town, but hit Sal's if you want best Grandma slice in AZ."}
{"text":"Crisp Premium Pizza is a tiny pizzeria tucked away in the 5th Avenue Shopping District of Old Town Scottsdale. Their specialty is \"Grandma Pizza,\" which is a style not commonly found in Phoenix. Think pizza squares, similar in some ways to Sicilian-style, but with a crust that's golden-brown on the bottom. It manages to have a crisp exterior, while the interior is very, very light, making the pizzas far less heavy than you'd probably assume.

The menu is no-nonsense. There are white or red styles, which you can then add toppings as you see fit. Single squares and whole pies are both available, but we ended up opting for a couple of squares each, more than enough for the average person.

I was curious what some of the criticisms were and the few that actually exist seem to be complaining that cheese is minimal. This is actually intentional. In fact, the taste might be a bit different than what many people are expecting.

In short, the pizza isn't bad by any means. Ingredients are all solid, although the enthusiasm is a bit too over-the-top, in my opinion. The crust, while having a great texture, didn't really have much actual flavor depth, which actually kind of surprised both of us. Given what some people are saying, I expected a bit more, especially after eating similar variations of this pie over the years.

That isn't to sell this place short, however. The pizza was good enough to where, if I actually lived in the area, I'd probably make occasional stops. But I'm not so sure it's worth regular trips across town. 

Drink options are limited and other food options are nonexistent. They keep it simple here and there ain't nothing wrong with that.

Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this new pizza joint bringing alil NY to AZ. The crust is like no other. It's walk up style, so you can grab a slice when walking thru oldtown Scottsdale. My fave was the white pizza, but you won't be disappointed with whatever you chose."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!   The crust is the best - light, airy and CRISP!  The sauce is spot on and all ingredients are fresh.  Without a doubt my new favorite pizza spot in all of Phoenix.  

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Just had a great pizza at Crisp. Unique flavor, nice crust and a great taste. The owners were super nice and really cared if I was a satisfied customer.  I normally don't like sauce over the cheese for my pizza, but this was very good.  I know this because I ate for taste way after I was full!  

I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I called and asked to place a carry out. Guy answered and said \"wrong number\" and hung up on me. Called back three more times and they answered and hung up again. Called off another number and they answered. I Told them I called three times and they said you called three times off a different number... so what. Then I told him he hung up on me and he said \"you said you wanted to speak to Antonio\"... wtf"}
{"text":"The pizza is gross! Hideously overpriced! The sauce was disgusting. Even the Pepperoni's were not good.  You're better off going to Little Caesars.
I've never ever left a review before but for some reason this place made me want to warn others to save their time and $$$ unless you want to spend $35 on the worst tasting pizza you have ever had in your life. And P.S the OWNER IS VERY RUDE!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!! My favorite pizza place, definitely a hidden gem in old town. The service is great too!"}
{"text":"I've been to Crisp Premium Pizza twice now and I've had an amazing experience both times. Adrian, the owner, is a great guy and he cooks some great pizza. This pizzeria serves grandma style pizza, which comes in a square shape. Everything is made to order, and they use premium ingredients. Really a fantastic pizzeria! I wish they were closer to home so I could visit more often!"}
{"text":"I have been in the pizza business for almost two decades now, and I have been to some the \"best\" that usually leaves me disappointed. This is hands down THE BEST pizza I have had in a long long time. The owner is awesome and makes a killer product, will def recommend and be back!"}
{"text":"We're so lucky to have this place close by for our lunch spot go to! Unique style pizza that is incredibly tasty- you can taste the freshness and quality of all the ingredients."}
{"text":"This is a must have in old town, the pizza here is amazing, light, crispy, and fresh! While the pizza was cooking we met the  family who owns Crisp, they are wonderful people who have been living in the valley for over four years now after moving from New York.  Support your neighbors while enjoying a delicious pie!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Seriously, the best crust I have ever had. Not too thick , not too thin, just right. The toppings  are super fresh and plentiful. Go now!! 
Super friendly service as well."}
