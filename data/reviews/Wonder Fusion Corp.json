{"text":"Wonder Fusion Corp \"Oh Xin Xiang Hui\" (???) has 3 locations (Scarborough, North York and Markham) and we've visited two location so far. The Food quality is not bad to be honest !!! Especially the Chopped chilli steam fish fillets (?????).    However, something has raised my concern on the Markham Location (505 Hwy &, Unit 98 & 99). I've noticed that each time when I phoned (I've already visited at least 3 times), they will say they \"Accept Credit Cards\". However, when you finished the meal, they will start telling you they don't credit cards because their \"boss\" told them to do so due to the owner doesn't want to pay the fee to the credit card company.  They try to soliciting you to pay cash or debit so they can save the fee.   My husband and myself noticed that other table (customer are non-Asian looking) they were paying credit card (I saw a red CIBC Visa on the bill tray 2 meters from us). I start to wonder how they do business in terms of facing customers with different ethnicity background.  I know for sure Scarborough and North York has made it clear that they ONLY accept cash or Debit card and they answers are consistent in person or via the phone ( which i really appreciated their honesty).... However, the experience of visiting the Markham (commerce gate) location, was not very pleasant. It seems  like:  (1) They lure you to their location by telling you they accept credit cards, but at the end is the completely different story. I hate dishonesty and we believe all the consumers do. .... People will also start to wonder if they're paying their \"tax\" honesty to Revenue Canada while owner encouraging so much of cash flow.   (2) When you speak Chinese (Mandarin, i don't think they understand Cantonese), they will expect you to do their way to pay \"cash\". Then the waiter and waitress will still showing their \"innocent eyes\" and tell you \" we are only working here and follow what our \"boss\" told us to do\"... I start wondering is your boss asking you to lie to your customers  on the phone?  No wonder the Asian Legend in the same Plaza doing a better business then this particular Oh Xin Xiang Hui\" (???)  @ Hwy 7, Markham location.  Just wanna warn you all to pay attention on this matter !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, food looks like what's in the menu and the service is quick and efficient. The only downside is that the food is really oily, but the flavours are great (and the oil tastes good...)"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good: -- #203 boiled fish with agaric (black fungus) in herbal soup is numbingly spicy and full of flavour. -- Garlic stir fried greens have a nice crunch, and well seasoned -- hot and sour soup is so so, I've had better ones  Service can be improved, we had to flag down someone every time we needed water or tea refilled. More experienced wait staff or better training would help."}
{"text":"I have tried few similar restaurant like this and this one is better of them all. It's clean and not cheap. The food taste very good. The service is pretty good. You should give it a try if you haven't try it yet."}
{"text":"Overall, 3.5 stars.    While Wonder Fusion is known for spicy food, we ordered only non-spicy entrees for our dinner, so this review is without a doubt relevant only to people interested in having non-spicy food at Wonder Fusion.    We ordered a Mutton with Onion ($9) and a Sauteed Shrimps with Cucumber ($9).  We opted for size Small for both entrees.     Mutton with Onion was good.  There was lots of mutton meat.  The mutton meat was well marinated and bold in flavour.  It was too oily just so slightly.  Maybe the oily was from the mutton?  Even the portion seemed small visually, it was actually okay considering the quantity of the mutton meat and the price.  While some might find this dish salty, I really enjoyed this dish.  I have no problem ordering it again in future visits.  The Sauteed Shrimps with Cucumber was very average.  There were lots of shrimps and, though previously frozen, the shrimps seemed fresh enough.  But I found the shrimp size too small for the meat to have any texture or taste.  The overall flavour of the whole dish was very delicate.  The portion was okay given the price.  This dish is good for people who like their food with very little salt.  I probably won't order this dish again personally.  Generally, the ingredients were sufficiently fresh.  The services were effective and efficient.  The store opens late on weekend."}
{"text":"We came here thanks to them being open after midnight. We went in July 2013 and getting there was a nightmare due to severe construction on the main road. There were crews and cones everywhere, and only one snaking lane open with no ability to turn into the restaurant from the main road. It took us about 10 min of detouring and searching after seeing the restaurant to be able to actually park there. Decor and looks we're nice, a little better than I expected. Happy kitty and money frogs statues as expected. Slight language barrier but EVERYTHING ON THE MENU HAD PICTURES!!!!! I think that is a big plus. Menu was surprisingly extensive and clear, colorfull, easy to navigate. My goal going in was to challenge my adventurous palate and order something unusual and that I could not recognize. Mission was successfull. I ordered the sliced fish spicy soup, one of the \"chef reccomended\" sections. I received a huge huge bowl of, what appeared at first to be peppercorns and hot chilies in.... Oil, maybe? The broth was not really edible for me, but I knew I was getting in trouble with ordering something with two \"spicy!\" indicators next to the menu item. I had to order some steamed rice to help me get through the meal. The fish was actually really good, except covered in whole peppercorns (seriously the bowl must have had 300+ peppercorns in there) which I had to take off. The flavor was strong from the hot chilies and pepper, so you could not taste the mild but very tender fish. There was also some unusual ingredient in my soup, a black/grey/dark brown flat but textured item, I believe it started with an a, and I was very excited because I could not recognize what it was. Maybe a vegetable, maybe a mushroom or fungi, or algal growth, maybe unidentified animal organ (definitely not muscle meat). It tasted like peppercorns, due to my soup being mostly peppercorns, and was chewy. If anyone knows what I might have eaten, please comment, but it was definitely not bad. As far as the menu, like I said before lots of interesting choices, plenty for mild palates as well as risk takers. My boyfriend got the spicy duck, which was amazing. We did order pork buns, the menu had a small dim sum section, but the pork buns were IMO not very good, and came way after our food did. Soda is served in cans, no  free refills, and water was not brought out unless you ask for it, due to hot pot of tea on table. What I did not like was that it took about 20 min until we were able to order once we were seated, and we never got a check, long after we were done we just kind of meandered to the front of the restaurant and waited to be checked out.  If I went back to Toronto I would definitely come back, due to good interesting food and huge menu!"}
{"text":"Wonder Fusion Corp is the 3rd location of Xin Xiang Hui, Hot Party Corp http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hot-party-restaurant-scarborough and Greatime Corp  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/new-greatime-corp-toronto  Opens from 11 to 5.. that is 5 AM! So if you are in the area at say 4am and needs anything from Northern dim sum, Noodles, Hot Pot or anything really spicy.. you will find it here!  The set up and the deco is from the previous 2 restaurants so it is quite different than the 2 sister restaurants. No sticky tables and floors, all waitress are in nice uniform and when I saw her took her Iphone out and take my order......that's impressive!  Menu with Colorful Photos makes ordering really easy.   Hot and Spicy Cold Noodle ($6.99) is of course hot and spicy and refreshing with cucumbers and sesame mixed inside. The noodles have great bite and portion size is great for late dinner!  Hot Hot Hot.. The complimentary cold fresh papaya tapioca coconut dessert really cooled my taste buds..    Lunch Specials! I need to come back to have lunch specials and of course some late night spicy fix!!"}
