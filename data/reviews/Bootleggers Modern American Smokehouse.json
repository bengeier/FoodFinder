{"text":"When we first arrived here, I thought this place would be a 5 star experience. Their bacon board and apple pie moonshine is out of this world.  After we had the bacon board, my husband and I took our server's suggestion and ordered their short ribs, which our server said were phenomenal. The short ribs come with fried coleslaw and we asked the server if we could sub asparagus and not get the fried coleslaw. So, the short ribs and asparagus come out. The short ribs were tough, small, and didn't have much flavor.  Then, when our bill came we were charged the full amount of the short ribs and coleslaw, and an additional $4 for our asparagus, which clearly shows that it's $4 on it's own. So, why did we have to pay full price to sub them and then not get a side that was supposed to come with our meal? So, we basically paid full price to not receive a side, and paid an extra four dollars for asparagus that would have been $4 regardless if it was subbed or not.   We also experienced some issues splitting our bill and my husband and I were charged $30 more than we were supposed to be, even after telling our server that some of the items on our receipt weren't ours before she swiped our card. We were still overcharged and had to cancel one tab, but still be recharged for the other.  This place started out a wonderful experience but it seemed to get worse and worse as the night when on.  I will definitely go back, but only for the bacon board and moonshine, not the entrees."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday and had a fantastic time. The service was top notch and the food was delicious. We had a bacon board which was amazing.  There were five of us and we were able to try several menu items. We had pulled pork, turkey, and prime rib along with our appetizer. The food was really delicious and tasty. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best barbecued brisket! I've been to Houston, Dallas, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and other major cities - and the barbecued brisket at Bootleggers outranks them all! Excellent service, healthy servings, comfortable seating, and a warm and friendly atmosphere for people of all ages. I've enjoyed Bootleggers for lunch and dinner several times and it is one of my Downtown Scottsdale favorites!"}
{"text":"We came to Bootleggers on two occasions. On a Friday night and a Sunday.   Friday night, I was really amazed by their Apple Pie Moonshine. We had their moonshine flight of 3 different flavors: apple pie, blackberry, and catdaddy. The apple pie was by far my favorite. It was warm, smelled like fresh apple pie out of the oven and tasted just like it too!   The blackberry flavor was good too. I wasn't a big fan of the catdaddy but that's because I like sweet drinks and it didn't have the fruity flavors that the other two had.  On Sunday, I had their delicious Bootlegger burger: pretzel bread bun, oozing with muenster cheese, slab bacon. Cheese was literally oozing out of the burger; check out the photo. I'm also a really big fan of pretzel bread. It was awesome. Oh and their homemade potato chips were really good; perfectly salty and crunchy.  My girlfriend had their pulled pork; it came with tortillas and coleslaw. The pork by itself was very tender and sweet. When you put those three ingredients together, it was a very very tasty medley. But I liked my Bootlegger burger better.  Quick note about the service: it was excellent! The bartender and our waitress both knew what to recommend for drinks and for eats. And they were very friendly. My water glass was never empty even after we paid our bill."}
{"text":"August 26, 2013  Based upon the recent write in the paper, we thought we would give B F&D a try. My entrée was a pulled pork sandwich and it was uneatable. The top bum was burnt. It was called to the attention of a waiter and they said they would call it to the attention of the cook staff.  That was it. Someone is not paying much attention in the kitchen.  Repeat business, I don't think so."}
{"text":"Started the evening with a moonshine flight of strawberry, blueberry and the apple pie. Blueberry was decent strawberry was better but the in house made apple pie was the star of the three. It was sweet with just the right amount of burn on the way down.   We moved on to the Bacon board it was amazing. I really enjoyed the jalapeño and applewood bacon. My wife enjoyed the con fit and we both felt the pork belly was the best thing in the board. The sweet onion spread was excellent as well as the house made pickles.   We then shared the BBQ sampler each of the meats on the sampler were very good but the pulled pork was the shining star by far. The BBQ sauce was thick and sweet.   As it was our 22nd anniversary they gave us a sample of the chocolate cake and the cherry pie milkshake. Both are awesome.   The waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly. Bootleggers will definitely become a staple for our dining dollars."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both visits were very positive. The food was very tasty (I highly recommend the bacon board) and the drinks  (the 'Apple Pie Moonshine' was KILLER) were really, really good. Best of all, their service was great. I highly recommend Bootleggers."}
{"text":"Came here on the Friday night before Super Bowl with my fiancé for some dinner, they are awesome because they are open late and still serve real food. Apparently a lot of old town restaurants don't get it, people that come to old town aren't going to bed at 9 PM.   Who shuts down their kitchen early when Super Bowl is in town? Brat haus does.   Anyhow rant over. This place was open and busy but not overcrowded which was great. The decor is modern and tasteful, warm and cozy.   I ordered the brisket and the cauliflower steak. The brisket was generously sized, came with extra barbecue sauce on the side because I asked for it, and the cauliflower steak was huge. Cauliflower was actually pretty decent, although I'm not a huge cauliflower fan, I wanted to order some vegetables. The brisket was very tender, to the point I would say it was overdone, almost like crockpot barbecue the night I was in there. I'm huge BBQ fan, so that cost them a star and a half. They do allow you to choose either fatty brisket or lean brisket. I'd be willing to give them another shot, maybe it was just the barbecue that night or the piece I got.   Service was great.   Drinks, I got the house moonshine and it was actually really good, maybe a little on the sweet side but overall memorable.  This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars, the Bootlegger burger was phenomenal!! Our server John Murphy was helpful in making recommendations and gave us great service!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Wait staff was very knowledgeable of the food and drink menu items and ready to offer suggestions. Food was on point!  Brisket, Mac & Cheese, Fries, Chips, Smoked Turkey and tacos were delicious!  The Jack Daniels Brownie is perfect to top off your meal.  Great food and service in Old Town!  Highly recommended dinner destination!"}
{"text":"If you don't know, this is the same place that was the North 51 Grill and the Dirty Drummer before that.  My family and I have been coming here for 30 years and after today, I highly doubt I'll be back.   Skip the wings! We ordered the grilled traditional and the only good thing I can say is that they were a decent size.  They were flavorless, except for all the butter and way undercooked.  We let the waitress know that they weren't good, especially compared to what they used to be, and she became very defensive.  You could literally see her face twitch when we told her that they used to be the best wings in town.  We got a quick and angry bit about this not being the same place any more and she continued to defend them.  I think she tired of being told how horrible they are.   I had a hamburger which was alright, but certainly not worth the $10 we paid.  The burger tasted salty.  Dad had the PBLT and while it looked tasty, he said it was good, but not $11 good.  I've noticed other reviews posted are glowing, but if I could, I wouldn't give it any stars.  I realize things have changed, but when you're know for something and do it well, you continue to do it.  In 30 years I've seen multiple incarnations of the Drummer/North 51 and at least half a dozen owners.  They've all tried new things and done well for a while, then faded because the tried and true items worked. I hope they realize that they need to stick to their basics. Don't fix what isn't broken."}
{"text":"If you want to fill up on a meal. You got to eat here. So tastey and the environment is good. Great service."}
{"text":"Found this on yelp and went there the other night..awesome.. started with the bacon board think i felt an artery clog but it was worth it for this all types of different jams and smokes on the bacon.  Tried the turkey leg delicious flavor with a reddish meat from the smoke.  Then when we couldnt fit the dessert they gave a free sample of the aplle pie moonshine.. taste exactly like apple pie with no hint of liquor..deliciously dangerous"}
{"text":"In reviewing my bill from bootleggers I realized I received no value for the money I paid. Especially the house margaritas, they were small, nearly all ice, and overpriced. You don't get a second chance to make a first impression, and I'm not giving him a second chance. I think it's just a Tourist trap."}
{"text":"Great staff,  great design,  great food.  Try the specialty cocktails too.  Had the pork sammy,  burger, chips and pb bourbon wings. Pork was delish on a crispy fresh sourdougb, bootleggers burger is amazing and so juicy and delish, chips and dip with bacon was to die for and the wings were just eh- a little overdone and on the asian side of the flavor spectrum.  Probably just personal taste.  Check this place out for sure,  jason at the bar is the bomb."}
{"text":"I hate to do this to you guys, as the grub is pretty darned good.  But I've got a few issues that I think need to be shared.  I've been to both Bottleggers, and on all occasions walked out feeling somewhat depleted despite having a full belly.  And the last time made me feel that Yelp was a good vehicle to let you know why.  I took two friends for dinner at Bootleggers the other night.  We walked into the fairly empty restaurant (it was a Tuesday) only to wait in excess of 7 minutes for anybody to seat us.  First the waitress looked the other way, then finally needed to address it with a \"sorry...we'll be right with you\".  Then a manager type walked by and said the same.  Finally that same waitress sat us at a table out in the open without offering other options.  It was fine, and the music was too loud but we took it without issue.  Then we perused the menu to find that they have seemingly eliminated any moderately priced options.  There is no \"Pulled Pork Sandwich\" or \"Brisket Sandwich\" and even the renowned burgers seemed to be absent.  It seems to be all platters now starting at $16 but most are $18.  They come with either a bun or tortilla's, although when we ordered them our waitress didn't ask so we just got tortillas.  We had to then request buns.    So we get our $60 worth of food and there is no additional BBQ sauce.  It takes 10 minutes to get eye contact with anyone despite many of them walking by the table.  I assure you that we're not shy.  Its just that they are very good at avoiding it.  Finally, the three of us ask for some more sauce and it comes out in basically a shot glass...for 3 people.  Now another few minutes while she gets us more.    Once again, the food was great.  It was obvious that they were disorganized, but once again it was a Tuesday night and there were plenty of staff.  They just seemed to be on drugs or something.    I hope they can get things together.  Once again, the music is a little loud for a dinner place (and take it from me...I am a rocker...I don't normally say that) but it was tough to carry on conversation.  Food is good.  Very good...but its obvious that they are doing everything that they can to maximize their average ticket.  The shame is, that yes...they did get us that one time.  But I don't think I'm coming back anytime soon.  Its not longer a place to get a good pulled pork sandwich.  Its a place that you've gotta drop a lot of coin for BBQ.  I'll do the atmosphere across the street  at Bandera or even the Mission if I want that."}
{"text":"Since we live in the neighborhood, we had to check this place out. Man, what an improvement to the decor compared to the last place when it was the Hwy 51 Bar. Anyways, don't let the exterior fool you - they really turned this place around. In addition to the decor, the food was great. I had the pulled pork and my husband had the smoked turkey - both delicious! We will certainly be back and are glad this is in walking distance to our house.  My only semi-con is that because the meats are smoked - the smokey smell is a bit overwhelming. But I'll take that for good food."}
{"text":"The bacon board is pure awesome!  Every entree I've had has been very good. The staff is always friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"I attended the Friends and Family preview nite Friday and I have to say I was very impressed...I heard they dropped 200K into the remodel...brick veneer on the walls very cool....the bar and dining area are well designed and modern....3 big screen TVs in the back area of the restaurant so if you want to catch a game you can - but if you just want to eat and chill you won't be bombarded by big screens in your face in the dining area...I didn't see a menu but the food they were turning out was delicious...I know they have world class chef here so I can't wait to go back in for dinner....they feature a huge stainless smoker which you can see through the windows located just off the kitchen....I tasted a burger, turkey sandwich, bbq sandwich and some nachos all with their spin on them just to name a few items....none of them disappointed.... quality selection of draft beers and wine and of course cocktails...had a Lagunitas IPA and a Red Ale then C.E. Kelly one of the bartenders whipped us up a couple of awesome Moscow Mules...friendly, attractive staff.....veteran bartenders...if you've been around Phoenix for a while you may recognize one or two of the staff...Not sure when they officially open but it has to be soon....happy to have them in my neighborhood!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend took me to this restaurant for my birthday and this was one of the worst, overpriced meals that I have ever had in Arizona!  We ordered separate things and both meals were terrible.  The pulled pork was dry, tasteless and not fresh.  The short ribs were also not good and she actually got physically ill shortly after eating at this restaurant.  Will NEVER try them again and do not recommend you waste your money here."}
{"text":"Here for Father's Day and they are way under staffed. Been here almost 2 hours and no food. Staff so rude and refused to make things better. Owners should wake up.  This could be the worst restaurant experience ever. We were over charged for all of our beers. The bar tender slammed our tab in the table and was rude like it was our fault because we waited two hours and had no food. They did nothing to make up for this terrible 1st experience and being a restaurant owner I know what should be done. I hope everyone takes this post seriously and there were 6 of us so expect more negative reviews. We have given them plenty of chances. Is there a -5 stars?  That would be too high. Terrible place and service. We even saw the bar tender drop ice cubes and put them back into a drink. Gross!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonite at the suggestion of friends and after viewing menu and reviews on yelp. Was very pleased with St Louis style ribs, Shreiner's (sp) sausage and AMAZED at fried coleslaw !!!  Disappointed with corn appetizer which looked awesome in photos here but tasted so frozen-corn-ish. Blueberry Bramble cocktail was perfect as was Trace 75 cocktail from the bar. Wanted to try the moonshine but we've had it elsewhere so decided to pass. It's a very fun addition to the list of libations tho. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stellar. We came here because we tried their meat at last year's farmer's market next door and remembered it all year. We were not disappointed. There were five of us and everyone loved their food. Very pleasant service- our daughter spilled my husband's beer all over and the server was so kind to her about it and brought another beer right away. BOH a little slow like others have said but totally worth the wait in a beautiful room. They also have a gorgeous, hidden patio with a fireplace. Cannot wait to go back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bacon board! Bacon board! It was AWESOME! Not only the bacon but the condiments (mustard/jellys) that come along with the bacon. Also had the BBQ sampler with an order of mac & cheese...it was super good. I've only been once but I've literally dreamed about that bacon board several times. Going back soon and I highly suggest trying Bootleggers out."}
{"text":"We got the BBQ sampler. The smoked turkey was a little dry, but had a good flavor. The brisket and ribs were delicious! The pulled pork was average, but made better with the bbq sauce! Coleslaw was overly oniony though. The Brussels sprouts with Lardon was a much better side. The best part of the whole meal was the Apple Pie Moonshine! It was absolutely delicious and only $1 on Monday's! There wasn't much of a crowd tonight and the food came out fairly quick."}
{"text":"Wow!  So glad we have such a great place in our neighborhood!!!  We started with drinks (love the moonshine, especially the Apple Pie Moonshine!) and then onto the Bacon Board!  5 types of bacon, we liked the Pork Belly Confit best but all were yummy.  The beef brisket was sooooo tender and pulled pork was great as well.  They make their own tortillas which is nicer than a bun and the cole slaw wash really fresh and not loaded up with sugary mayonnaise.  Cauliflower grilled with sweet onions and melted cheese was a nice change of pace as was the grilled corn on the cob.  We had tons of food to take home since the servings are generous.  Finished the meal off with a great brownie with Jack Daniels and ice cream.  The service was excellent!!  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went here after ChowBella's numerous tweets about how good this barbecue was. I've gotta say, I was unimpressed. This is not real barbecue.  First, the good: -Cocktails were well done and $2 off craft cocktails was a nice special for HH -Pickled veggies that came with the wings were very good, and ample (and also unexpected) -Once we were actually able to order, the food and drinks came out in a reasonable amount of time. -The food was pretty good; the cole slaw that came with the meats was very good, and so were the accompanying tortillas which were good enough that they could have been house made -They did comp us some drinks for the poor service  Now, the bad: -the service was awful. Showed up at 5:25 and the first two of 8 were there. Got our first order of drinks fast enough, however, we did not see the server again until 6:05 (having 6 more people show up and get ignored for 20 minutes was inexcusable), which was conveniently right after HH pricing ended. We tried to waive her over several times from 5:45-6 (which was answered with \"I know, I'll be right over\"). -Chicken wings were good enough. Advertised as \"cold-smoked\" they tasted like regular fried wings. We ordered the PB&J flavor based on the server recommendation; they were fine, but I'd opt for traditional next time -A friend and I split the Brisket, Turkey, Mac&Cheese, and Green Beans. When our food came out, we got the Brisket, Pulled Pork, Mac&Cheese and Smashed Potatoes, so we sent the wrong ones back and (eventually) got the correct food.  -the brisket was tender and nicely seasoned, but lacked in smoke flavor. It was also glazed with a barbecue sauce after having been sliced  -The turkey was nice and smokey but had a bit of a cold cut vibe to the thin, uniform slices. -Mac&Cheese as overly salty; we had two kids order some at the table, and the kids version did not have the Parmesan topping leading to a nice seasoning level -The comped drinks simply made up the difference between what we should have paid (if we had decent service and got an extra 5 or so drinks as well as wings at HH price) and what the \"original\" bill had us charged at -I've never been a huge fan of Southern Pride smokers (although the aroma entering as well as the pit on display by the entrance was a nice touch), preferring barbecue joints that use an Oyler pit or custom models  Overall there was enough promise that I will visit again. With good service and the right order (I would like to try their PBLT as it comes highly recommended) I could see amending this to 3 or even 4 stars for BBQ-inspired New American food, but if you want real, traditional, smoky BBQ, this ain't the place."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was disappointed.  Our reservation was for 7:30 and two of the items we wanted to order, the boot dumplings and the smoked prime rib, were not available.  We ordered Nacho Flat and the pulled pork instead.  Neither of them were very good.  We won't be going there again."}
{"text":"While their food was very good we experienced a serious problem with them. We used our credit card at the restaurant and when the statement came in an additional $30+ had been added in. So far we have made four calls to the restaurant to get it resolved and no one ever calls us back after promising to do so. If you go, USE CASH!"}
{"text":"My folks have lived in this area for a few years now, and frankly, this area has been totally devoid of any interesting dining options.  I'm serious - it was like a dining wasteland.  After reading some of the Bootleggers buzz on ChowHound, my wife and I popped in on a recent Sunday afternoon, just in the faintest hope of having a decent meal of food.  The good Lord provideth!  The menu isn't huge, but every single thing on it is interesting and you can tell that each has been carefully constructed.  I'm not even joking - it took us fifteen minutes (and 3 or 4 passes by our server) just to make up our minds on what to order.  We ended up splitting the smoked turkey sandwich (mighty tasty) and then shared the braised kale, the smashed potatoes and the cauliflower \"steaks.\"  All were exceptional, especially the cauliflower.  I'm of the mind that eating stuff like cauliflower and kale is necessary in order to (hopefully) extend my time on this earth.  I'd never seen or heard of a cauliflower being prepared this way, but it was such a creative way to \"dress up\" a vegetable that routinely fails to impress (me, at least).  We're very much looking forward to trying the rest of the menu, especially more from the smoker!  Beyond the food, we each enjoyed a local brew, but have since learned that they've got some legitimate cocktails as well.  On the whole, we really dug the whole Bootleggers concept.  It's unique and you can see (and taste) some real genius behind this place.  In closing, thank you, God, for Bootleggers.  The good folks in that neck of the foods (and me whenever I've visited) have suffered long enough!  :)"}
{"text":"Tim the bartender extaordinairre is well worth a visit. Craft cocktails, mad men basics and moonshine like grammy made are all well within Tim's wheelhouse. And really, really goid! Try it, you will LOVE it!!!!"}
{"text":"First time going tonight. Great food! Don't pass up the bacon platter! I had the brisket and my fiancé had the ribs. Very delicious! Best part was the service. Dana was very attentive. She got us samples of their house apple pie moon shine, so good! The manager and head chief came out to greet tables also. Great experience overall. No complaints."}
{"text":"You can always recall your worst and best meals. This was one of the later. The wedge salad details were perfection and the BBQ sampler was full of happy surprises. Roll your own brisket, slaw and home made tortillas was a nice touch. The stormy night kept the place sadly empty, but the server's table patter drowned out the rain with just the right amount of service and jokes. Great performance, one to remember."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both times the food was excellent. Lighting can be a bit on the dark side, they have candles on the tables but my older in-laws needed the flashlight from my phone to read the menu. Food is amazing, so far we have tried the bbq and burgers both were excellent, and I highly recommend the sweet potato fries and apple pie moonshine."}
{"text":"I never understand why the \"bad\" reviews are always the ones \"not recommended.\" Hopefully this one makes the cut. I'd like to give them both less and more stars.  First time I had bootleggers was at the Saturday farmers market next door. I tried the samples of the tacos, man got a pound of the brisket. It was great. The brisket was phenomenal. It was diced instead of strips, delicious. We went again, I just got a side of Mac and green beans and again he got the brisket. We were going to call on but were already out the door and live down the street, so I said let's order when we get there. Terrible terrible idea. It was after the lunch hour but before dinner, probably around 3 or 4. We waited for our food for an hour. No exaggeration there. The man who seems to run the bar, maybe the whole place, didn't seem very sympathetic. After about 40 minutes I made a casual \"so how's that good doing remark?\" To which we received a \"yeh it's coming.\" Oh...okay. After another few minutes he decided he would poor us some water, and have us a taste of the moonshine (which is quite good.) He made some sort of comment about it being okay that we were waiting so long because I got to try their moonshine for free. Thank you for your generosity... Anyways, got the food took it home. Green beans were okay, the fried onion I believe with it was stale, however the Mac was freaking awesome. The brisket was two tiny slices, some coleslaw was fluff and a few tortillas (why I will never know.) Overall we really enjoyed the food, not the weight time or the portions though.  Got the food again tonight. Again we ordered out, using the online menu. Once I was set on fries chicken (after ordering at arrogant butcher and them being out of fried chicken two weeks ago) I was so excited. He didn't communicate very well that they didn't have that, and we must be looking at a menu for the other location. Okay, I was set on that so nothing else sounded good. Just stuck with the Mac, man got the brisket again and pulled pork. Today there were about five or six slices of brisket. I'm sorry what? You gave us two measly slices last time and six this time?! The flavor of both meats were great. Strangely the tortillas were really good today too. But let me tell you, the Mac is disgusting. That's so disappointing! I HATE restaurants that do not have consistency. So now I'm stuck with no dinner except tortilla and coleslaw and a few bites of the meat. So disappointing.  This place has the potential for great food. But be consistent for gods sake. And work on your service. Everyone is nice but the customer doesn't appear to be a priority, news flash, we don't enjoy long wait times. I've never dined in house, and I'm scared to.   Seems like a place you go to drink, not eat, even though the food is the real show piece. Not sure the next time I'll go now."}
{"text":"Went to bootleggers for the first time last night to celebrate my \"birthday\" with visiting family members. Our server was Dana. She gave us the best experience all of us could have asked for. My uncle was very particular in getting exactly what he wanted and she took the time to explain everything that we were all asking. For my birthday delivered a chocolate brownie ice cream cake, it was amazing! We also got the chance to try to apple pie moonshine.. Oh my gosh, I'm getting that every time from now on!! When I return to bootleggers in the future, which I will, I'm definitely going to request Dana's section! I'm also going to tell all my coworkers that we need to go there!"}
{"text":"Decor is great and the service was attentive and friendly. The BBQ was above average. The moonshine drinks we skipped, seemed a little too gimmicky."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service was great and quick; we literally could've gotten out of there in 30 minutes, but the vibe was so fresh that we decided to stay for a couple more drinks! Love it!!"}
{"text":"The apps and food were a \"10\"!  Our service was just right, not too intrusive.  And the moonshine flights were off the charts as well.  This could be my favorite spot....and I live in Tempe!!!"}
{"text":"Overall we had a very disappointing experience here. We had the bad luck to come in after a very big party which clearly they were not ready for or could handle well. We waited nearly an hour before getting our food- now mind you we have a toddler so keeping her calm and entertained for all that time is no small feat. When we finally were served my food was stone cold which tells me it was sitting in the window and no one bothered to run it. I grabbed our waiter and explained the situation and he did offer to remake it but I did not care to wait another hour to get my meal. He explained they got slammed because of the large party which I could almost forgive if the 2 tables on either side of us hadn't  been served and had finished their meals before we got our meal delivered.   **that said the quality of the food was good but clearly it would have been much better hot and if we hadn't had to wait****  The manager did come over and apologize and offered to comp my meal and give us some desserts. I told him that would be great and much appreciated yet 20 mins later we had no check or desserts. We had now hit the 2 hour mark and I should add that I found the metal chairs to be very uncomfortable as I have back issues so I was beyond cranky now. We finally saw the waiter and asked for the desserts to be wrapped up because it was past my daughters bedtime and she was at her limit.   My husband brought us here with high hopes after eating there before but I have to say after the cluster of events we feel victim to it would be hard to give them another try,  PS- The desserts did not stand up to being brought home. The brownie was dry and hard as a rock the next day."}
{"text":"The flavors are outstanding! Atmosphere is amazing! Salads to burgers, everyone loved their food!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ smoked meat ever besides the great service from Justin! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Really had a great meal here!  We started the night with a couple of their in-house moonshines. Apple Pie and Blueberry! Both were delicious.  For food, they have tons of Smokey deliciousness going on.  It was Happy Hour so I went for one of each of their Tacos. Smoked Salmon, Steak, Pork Belly, Brisket. They were all very good, with focus on the Salmon and Pork Belly. My wife went for something we'd never seen before, Smoked Tofu. Texture was still nice and firm, and had a great smokey flavor.  The service was great, waiter really explained everything they had in detail. Definitely a place I'd go back to! Need to try more of their Smokey Goodness!!!"}
{"text":"The moonshine was on point!! The BBQ plate for four definitely fed that and more. Excellent flavor. The multiple types of BBQ sauces were delicious!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW GO! You must go! This place is so good. Doesn't look like much from outside but the second you walk in you know you're in for some BANGIN food and service. Love it here. The chef is so damn good! I think he's famous? Not sure but he should be!"}
{"text":"Bootleggers is tremendous!  My husband and I stopped in there over the weekend for a beer.  He drank a delicious IPA they had on tap and I had the most wonderful margaritas I have ever had.  Our server recommended the wings so we ordered those.  They were, without a doubt, the best wings we have ever had.  Traditional wings but they have a smokey flavor to them that made them so delicious.  We asked our server what else was good - he said the mac n cheese was great.  So we ordered that.  SCRUMPTIOUS!  Five kinds of cheese - very, very creamy and soooo delicious.  We told him he was two for two.  He also recommended the brisket which we ordered.  Fork tender, amazing brisket.  Full of flavor - we were in love!  It was served with a delicious coleslaw which was a nice surprise since coleslaw isn't always the best.  This one was really, really good.  Our server was three for three.    We will be going back to Bootleggers to sample more of their incredible food and drinks.  Our server was extremely kind, friendly and helpful.  This place gets 5 stars from us.  :-)"}
{"text":"Well, just over-priced food. I had the sampler and the quality of food was less than expected for the money. Service was not bad, but anyway, I go to restaurants for foods not a service. So, I will not come back for any reason."}
{"text":"This place has the best Pulled Pork sandwich I have ever had. The pork was juicy, wasn't very messy and a lot of flavor. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ali made a perfect Old Fashion, so good. Service was good, food was delicious. A little pricey for a regular place to hang out. But I will definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went last night. We each got an entree and a drink and split the apple pie moonshine. We sat on the patio which was really nice, really cute decorations. The service was great. Our server was always there when we wanted but wasn't always interrupting us. The moonshine was really good, super smooth with no bite at all. (We couldn't decide whether that was a positive or negative.) The food was okay. I got the pulled pork and it was pretty dry. I had to ask for extra BBQ sauce. The coleslaw was terrible. I don't think it had any sauce on it at all. My boyfriends chicken was pretty good, but really small and didn't have much meat on it. Overall a decent experience. I would go back, but not to eat."}
{"text":"Service was not great. Kept having to remind the waitress to bring items. They were out of tri-tip even though we are dinner at 6pm. The servings were smaller than expected. My toddler and I both ordered a grilled cheese and the adult grilled cheese was the exact same as the childrens meal grilled cheese. Also we did a sampler of the moon shine and it was all disgusting.  When we made reservation we mentioned it was my mother in laws 60 birthday and they didn't even acknowledge it during our dinner."}
{"text":"We heard so much about this place, so we decided to try it tonight. The bbq was good, not great. We had the sampler platter for 2 for $39.Couldve had more ribs on it. We would come back for another try if it wasn't for the poor service and overpriced drinks. $6 for a Coors light? I had a moscow mule which was $10, and just wasn't right. The staff was more concerned about a drunk girl outside than attending to the customer. Too bad, there's too much bbq competition in Phoenix to be lax on service. When walked out after paying the tab and not one staff member said thank you or anything. Guess that's why the place was half empty..."}
{"text":"Awesome people , awesome food! Great prices, prime rib was very good , and the ribs , unable to stop eating them all!!"}
{"text":"Have to say I love Bootleggers since it first opened.  I have tried the burger, pulled pork sandwich, pulled pork lunch special and the grilled cheese.  All were fantastic and the service is great.  The flavors of the BBQ have been good for almost every single time we have gone to the place.  Larry, one of the bartenders, has taken great care of us and I certainly will be going back to Bootleggers many times in the future."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this place and I was a little bit disappointed. We were sat right away, but it took forever for someone to come over and greet us. After that it took about 40 minutes for us to get our meals. The meat was pretty good, but I don't believe it was worth the high prices. There is a lot better BBQ in the Arizona area at cheaper prices I would rather go to."}
{"text":"I give this a 5 star review in the context of the price point and execution.  Exactly what you'd want in a Bar & Grill.  PBLT is a must-have, cocktail menu is no-joke, wings are exceptional.  I anticipate becoming a regular."}
{"text":"ROCKED the bacon board. Crushed the Pulled Pork. Need i say more. Bacon and BBQ.  This place is not located where most would ever see it so i highly recommend you find this cozy little modern dive and indulge in the divine tastiness!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! How do I sum it up.......AMAZING! I will, however, caution you: don't go here if you can't eat like a man. Bacon, pork, beer. All of it awesome!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ  I've ever had. Everyone got something different and loved it. I would recommend ordering the sampler so you can try everything. If you love bacon, the bacon board appetizer is a must. We will definitely come back whenever we're in town!"}
{"text":"Stopped by right after happy hour and the place wasn't too busy. Our waitress Dana was super friendly and made great recommendations. I had the prime rib and my girlfriend had the pork belly BLT (PBLT) which were phenomenal! Both had great flavor and were cooked perfect! Dana also recommended a couple of moonshine cocktails which were great as well. If it's your first time, ask for Dana as she had great recommendations and the perfect waitress."}
{"text":"poor customer service by night wait staff... never again. we waited for 10 minutes to be seated only to sit 20 plus minutes without a drink order being taken. poor showing by night staff. I should have went when I usually would go. day time..."}
{"text":"Everything was great!  Atmosphere and food are top notch. The bacon board and sweet corn are spectacular.  My only disappointment is that I live in California and can't eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  Our waiter John Murphy was the best!  The bacon board is a must try."}
{"text":"Before I start talking about the actual restaurant and the food, I am a 14 year old who got Yelp for the sole purpose of writing this. My family and I were on vacation and we decided to make a reservation, after hearing good things about it.  It turned out that the staff was short handed that night, and was operating with one less server(not to mention it was packed because of spring training). My waiter, Lee, was one of the most amazing waiters I have ever had at a restaurant in my life. I don't think I've ever seen a waiter work harder at what they do, while enjoying it so much and putting a smile on other people's faces.  Even after getting yelled at by some lady at the table across from us, he remained positive and continued to work hard. Towards the end of the meal I was talking to him about having a job and he told me that even on the bad days, and even when you're getting yelled at, don't get down on yourself, because there's always someone having a worse day. And yes, the food was amazing; however, I just needed to share how phenomenal Lee was.  I strongly believe Lee deserves a raise or promotion of some kind."}
{"text":"My first experience went well. I thought the food was really good. All of it had good flavor.  BootLeggers brings its own unique taste to every dish.  I had the Boot Burger. One of the best burgers I've ever had.  Also had the BBQ wings really good appetizer.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Best place for BBQ around!  Satisfaction guaranteed!!!!!  Amazing food and service.  Get the nachos and pulled pork or brisket!!!!"}
{"text":"Best brisket I've ever had. And the Mac n cheese is amazing. I'm not a huge yelp guy but this place is legit."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and very disappointed.  Other than the ambience the food and service have been inconsistent at best....Tried everything popular on the reviews, (Nachos, Brisket, Pork Belly Sandwich, Mac and Cheese) and my experiences have been exactly opposite.  Terribly inconsistent, greasy, and just super disappointed as a live 2 blocks away.  My waiter told me the owner makes their moonshine at his house.  C'mon, really?  Bad luck or an off night....3 times I don't think so.    My guess with all the reviews is that people have already made up their mind before coming here.  I have wasted too much money giving this neighborhood spot another chance.  If you want REAL BBQ in North Phoenix go to Pork on a Fork.  Oh yeah.......the owner parks his white Range Rover in the handicapped spot in the front......nice touch"}
{"text":"Five Stars for a great little spot when you want some hearty comfort food in a warm, cozy setting. The best thing we ate: House Smoked Turkey open faced sandwich (tasted unlike any turkey sandwich I've ever had) and the Slow Braised Kale (unbelievably good)! But before you order anything, go for the Bacon Board -- yes, a sumptuous board of pork offerings (see photo). And for desert, the Firefly Apple Pie Moonshine. Close your eyes when consuming and you'll swear you're eating your Grandma's homemade apple pie! Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner. We had the pork belly tacos and salmon tacos. Both to die for. We also tried the deviled eggs with the truffle oil. Really yummy!!!!  This is a delicious place to visit in old Town. Yummy food. Great outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"My absolute new favorite place. I almost didn't want to write this for fear that more people will invade my new sanctuary.  The late night bar staff is amazing. These guys can make some craft cocktails that will blow you away. You must try the applepie moonshine as well. Great date night ambience, super cute patio and really nice decor. I am sorry to say I have not been there early enough to try the food yet - but the menu is really impressive. You must stop by and give this place a try - it seriously rocks."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience, the chicken was a small thigh and salmon was a 5oz portion.  I ordered the salmon medium rare it came out well done.  It had no seasoning at all on it.   Very disappointed in the costumer service and the prices are to high for the what we ordered."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews here on Yelp and after seeing the Best of Phoenix award, I really thought this place was going to be top-notch. I ordered the pulled pork that comes with slaw plus a side of green beans. I'm not saying this to be hyperbolic, but nothing on my plate was appetizing. Anyone who has eaten enough BBQ will tell you that pulled pork that comes out of the kitchen pre-sauced is a bad sign. When the bartender sat the plate in front of me, not only was it pre-sauced, it was swimming in grease. There was absolutely nothing aesthetically pleasing about what was sitting in front of me.   The first bite confirmed my suspicion: the pulled pork was horrible. The sauce was way too sweet -- no vinegar whatsoever. Sauce should be used to compliment the meat, but all I could taste is sugar. The texture of the pulled pork may have been the worst part of the plate. It was so mushy that it stuck to the roof of my mouth. I imagine that they pull a whole shoulder, sauce it, and hold it in a warming pan until someone orders it. Either that or they smoke the shoulder at too low of a temperature, which could also cause pulled pork to be overly greasy.  The sides were equally disappointing. They advertise the slaw on the menu as not too creamy and not to vinegary. Well, then why was the slaw half liquid with absolutely no vinegar? The green beans were bland, and they were about to drown in the oil the cook sautéed them in.  Maybe I just came in on a bad night, but I won't be spending any money here again. In fact, I'm not sure if I would eat their food again if it was free."}
{"text":"Our first time here - we had a server named Christopher. He was truly amazing. Great service and very personable.  He could tell we were not from the area but he made us feel very welcomed.   We went back two days later to stop in for some drinks and he gave us the warmest welcome.  Great guy! Tell him we said his service was \"top notch!\" ps.  Apple Pie moonshine is ridiculously tasty! And the apple shandy wow -  amazing.  Food great.  Don't miss out on this gem."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service by john.  John had great suggestions on moonshine.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times over the past 6 years.  Service, food, and drinks are always consistently good.  Caters to a neighborhood crowd, but worth the trip.  It is not 'traditional' bbq in terms of a specific regional style (i.e. Texas, NC), but everything is extremely tasty.  Love their cole slaw, apple pie moonshine, and brisket.  Note: although normally a very subdued atmosphere they sometimes have live music, which makes for a very loud restaurant (it is a fairly small space)."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise!  Great menu, excellent food quality and service to match. Best smoked food I've had this far west."}
{"text":"Just about everything that could go wrong with a meal did. Thought we would try something new and found this had decent reviews. The picture Google put up was a beautiful grilled cheese sandwich. Grilled cheese was not on the menu, but that was okay, a barbecue sandwich sounded just as good. After watching the only other table in the place get their food before us even though they came in well after us, the waitress apologized and offered us a discount. The food came, and the brisket was drenched in onions. This was not documented on the menu or I never would have gone for it. I couldn't even eat my food. One of my friends gave me half a French dip. It was nasty. The bill came and there was no discount. You never know if you don't try, but I will not be trying this one again."}
{"text":"I have driven by this location for 2 years and had yet to frequent it. Last night, I made a reservation. I have never used yelp before and had to sign up, since the restaurant uses it for its reservations, etc. The ambiance was a complete surprise, as you can never judge a book by its cover!! Casual, romantic, comforting...all in rolled into one. There was live music..that added to its splendor as well. The food was fabulous..though my eyes were bigger than my tummy. Or that could have been the 3 Apple Shandys (highly recommend) that went down so smoothly!! The cherry on the whole experience was our server, Josh. He was energetic, friendly and attentive. He has the ability to make you think he was only there for your service and no one else's! Fabulous Drinks, Amazing Food and Phenomenal Service!! Bootleggers is a must, not just for a foodie, but for anyone wanting an excellent dining experience"}
{"text":"Good service!  While the fare is tangy tasty down home bbq, it definitely raise the dining experience on regular 'ol bbq. The atmosphere is a little  casual chic, but the food is down home good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the absolute best atmosphere. It starts from the moment you get out of your car and smell the aroma from the smokehouse. From there, it is dark inside which creates a calm homey feeling. The decor is perfect. The food is out of this world! Apple pie moonshine? Just say yes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best smoked prime rib I've ever had!  Tables and chairs are metal and uncomfortable, but otherwise a great meal!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We ate ten different things, and everything was delicious. If you are in Scottsdale, go here."}
{"text":"My husband and I couldn't be happier to have finally found a great restaurant in our area! A convenient location off the 51 on Shea Blvd, makes this place easy and fast to access from anywhere.  We initially went in for an after dinner cocktail, but soon realized we wanted to try everything we saw coming out of the kitchen. We ordered the Bacon Board, and couldn't have been happier with the results!  Both the food and cocktail menu is fun with a twist on the regular american cuisines and beverages.  If you're looking for a casual, fun, and cozy dining experience this is the place to check out."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING My husband and I ate here Wednesday night 4/5/17.  I ordered the RED BRICK CHICKEN, supposedly farm fresh chicken breast.  It tasted a little gamey, but I ate it anyway.  3/4 of the way through, my stomach would not tolerate anymore.  The waitress took 15 minutes to give us our dinner check after we asked for it.  Two hours after dinner I had the absolute worst food poisoning I've ever had... I almost went to the ER for it.  Never going to anywhere like this place again- too much pretension and the product is obviously foul."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but staff make this place exceptional. Went twice in a week one for a guys night out and the other on a date night both times had a great experience.   I had a few different items off the menu: the bacon board, the sampler, grits and shrimp, the hash, and brisket. Side items: Mac and cheese, grilled cauliflower steak, and coleslaw. All items were great. The best was the brisket though the people I was with favored the pulled pork. The bacon board is a must if you enjoy bacon. The three sauces were unique and tasteful.   The highlight of both evenings were the wait staff. The night of guys night out the owner greeted us and shared parts of the menu on the house. Which made my party feel more welcome. My date night was just as great. Our waitress was fun and had great recommendations. We ordered the moonshine flight and beer flight. Pretty good craft selection with fantastic pairings with the dinner. Overall the house moonshine was the best.   The ambiance is very appeasing. Dark room with great music in the background with everything from r&b to contemporary adult rock. Outside seating is amazing but sortof cold so I stayed inside.   Upon leaving the restaurant the staff came to thank us for visiting. This is a place that you must visit."}
{"text":"Found the place on Yelp and tried it out. Service was amazing. Had the ribs and they were delicious. The meat was tender and fell right off the bone.   Larry the bartender was absolutely awesome!  He was very attentive, nice, and a great server.    Loved the place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best smoked meats in town!! BAR IS VERY SATISFYING, with one of the best moonshine I've tried. It's very sweet, nothing I would expect from regular moonshine. Try the bacon board, it's will make your taste buds explode. If Janette is working you are taken care of, she is the best server in town. She has great customer service and always has a smile on her face."}
{"text":"All four of us loved our meal.  The meat was tender and full of flavor.  The tortillas were absolutely the best we'd ever eaten.  Our waiter was informed and attentive.  We all said we'd be returning to Bootleggers. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is quaint and welcoming."}
{"text":"We had  party of 6 people Friday July 4th and it wasn't crowded by any means. We got sat and our drinks cam out reasonably fast. We had 3 Salmon plates that were ordered, 1 salad, 1 pulled pork and I had 2 appetizers. All the salmons came under cooked and one FROZEN!! They took those back and said they'd re-do them. Then the pulled pork sanwhich came out with no bun and no side (never ended up getting the side for the rest of the meal, the bun came out about 20 mins later). The salad was okay and so were my apps but what a cluster F of a meal. For a pretty high pice $24 for a salmon dish I expect it to come out with perfection, to have ALL 3 messed up you definitely wonder who is running the back of house. I'd never go bck. 2nd visit there for another person in our party and the same things happened to them on their first visit. Definitely would not recommend to  waste your money  or your time."}
{"text":"Love the flapper cocktail, made from scratch! Bacon board, devil eggs, and tacos! Amazing"}
{"text":"Great food, insanely SLOW service!  I went here on a Sunday night with three of my friends and we were one of maybe five tables in the entire restaurant.  It took them about 20 minutes to get our drinks, another 10 to take our order, and we didn't get our food until about an hour and 20 minutes after arriving.  Luckily, we had a lot to talk about and weren't in a rush, but the inattentiveness of our server was a little ridiculous.  The food really was fantastic, but they should try to keep things moving a little faster."}
{"text":"BACON BOARD...a definite must have when visiting. I am a bacon fanatic so once I saw that I was sold. Didn't get an opportunity to try any other food, but I will be back to try it out for sure. I tried the apple pie moonshine that they're supposed to be known for, it was pretty good definitely sweeter than expected, they have other types of moonshine and signature cocktails made with the different moonshine, so needless to say I will be back to try them all. Haha"}
{"text":"The food is actually great and we were really looking forward to having the bacon board on the 4th of July, but we sat and sat at the bar while the bartender tended to his glasses. It wasn't busy and it was around 12:30pm and we couldn't understand why he couldn't ask us if we needed anything or even acknowledge our existence. We decided to leave and were quite shocked with the poor service. Won't go back to that one, but will to the one on Shea. At least there they are nice and say hello!"}
{"text":"The macaroni and cheese with \"7 or 8\" types of cheese was unbelievable.  We had the St. Louis style ribs with a Dr. Pepper barbeque sauce on the that provided a sweet, smoky taste to the meat which was falling off the bone.  The only reason why this review doesn't have 5 stars is that it very warm inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent addition to the neighborhood!!  The cocktails were delicious especially at happy hour.  I had the ribs.  I do some smoking of my own and I gotta tell you these were about the best ribs I've ever had.  The smoked chicken wings done traditional style were also fabulous.  My wife had the beef brisket which was a little dry because it looks like they put it on the grill after they slice it.  Overall I'm delighted they are here and will be back.  Nice ambiance and they do take out!!  The service was excellent."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving four stars is because I am a vegetarian and this place doesn't work for me. However the salads are great and the choose of drinks are really good. We love the atmosphere inside as well.  It felt very comfortable and had a modern rustic look. Keep up the good work and hope you stick around."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.  The service was something less than expected. We were told there would be a wait and understood that was to be expected. A very nice gentleman took a cell phone number to text when the table would be ready. This is a great system. In less than 15 minutes we were texted for seating. When we walked over to get our table, the hostess looked to me and said \"they can wait\" in a very unpleasant voice. The gentleman said \"No\" and took us to our table. Thanks for standing up to that bully of a Hostess!!!  Our service was extraordinarily poor! It took about 20 minutes before we got out drinks except one persons in our group never his drink. I had to go to the bar after about 45 minutes to get it myself. The server, who was standing there doing nothing said \"the bartender got slammed and never got around to your drink\". Why didn't she do something about is? Was she going to do anything about it? It was only a beer. I asked him for it and he took less than 10 seconds to grab, untwist the cap and hand it to me...I wondered of the Hostess had anything to do with our poor service?  It's unfortunate to have pretty good food with employees who are killing the business."}
{"text":"Exceptionally good food. I had the smoked prime rib with goat cheese mash potatoes and it was amazing. I'm giving the place 3 stars because of our server. We came in with 2 children at 6:30 on a Friday night. It wasn't all that busy and were seated right away. We are within walking distance of our hotel and we planned to get two or three drinks with our meal. From the beginning she was impatient with us. I asked to see the draft list and was told they don't have one. So I asked her to list what was on tap and she asked me to pick a style. I didn't know what I wanted, I wanted to see everything but I decided to pick IPA to be kind and took one of the two choices I was given. It was annoying but it's not her fault they don't have a beer list.  The food came out in 10 minutes flat and she had the bill on the table 10 minutes later asking if we saved room for dessert. I was half way through my main course at this point. She never asked if we wanted another beer or to refill our drinks. I waited for a while for her to come back so I could get another beer and when she didn't come I decided to pay. The literal moment I put the credit card down on the table she appeared from nowhere to pick it up. We were in and out in 40 minutes with a $70 tab. I don't know why she rushed us out as fast as she did but was really obvious and rude. There were no other kids in the place and we're in our mid 30s. The rest of the crowd were late 20s Scottsdale types. I can only guess that because they sat us at a booth and the crowd had started to come in that we weren't going to make her as much money as a bigger group in that spot would. I make good money as a software engineer and usually tip well, but I dress like a shlep and as a result I will sometimes get judged, especially in Scottsdale. I will be going back again for the food but when I do I will avoid her section. She was a nice girl but she has no business working as a waitress."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, food was great, entertainment was first class (but that's why we went there).  Service was bad, but I would put that down to our specific server.  Took 20 minutes to take our order, had to ask another server for a second beer, took 10 minutes to get our bill after I asked for it.  Hostess was very apologetic and accommodating though."}
{"text":"Bootlegger burger is maybe the greatest burger I've ever had.  The Jack Daniels brownie had an excellent amount of cocoa in the brownie, topped with amazing ice cream.  The waiter (owner?) was extremely jovial and pleasant.  Would send anyone here."}
{"text":"Great food great service...best prime rib ever!  John and Jose rocked it."}
{"text":"This was really good. Got the Bootlegger burger which was huge and amazing. Ended up eating it without the bun with a fork....good homemade chips and cottage fries as well."}
{"text":"Bacon board is where it's at!  Service was friendly and timely. They have some awesome moonshine and pretty decent cocktails. The smell coming from that place is enough to get you in the door. Very chill and rustic atmosphere. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious everything here. The brisket was so tender and tasty. Pork tacos were equally delish. Great smokiness. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have introduced this restaurant to many, many people because it's a reflection of my taste and style.  The atmosphere, food and service is TOP NOTCH!  I will forever be in love with their apple pie moonshine and bacon board."}
{"text":"I decided to try this establishment out on a recommendation from the ChowBella blog for one of the top places to go on a date.    My husband and I tried the sampler platter, moonshine (how could you not), and the potato brisket as an appetizer.  Everything was ok.  But honestly, we've had better BBQ.   It seems to me that Bootleggers is trying hard to make BBQ hip (kind of like Country Music).     The interior was very modern and as was the music playlist.   But overall...I was left unimpressed with the food and the atmosphere.  The service was excellent though :)"}
{"text":"To be blunt, the food was TERRIBLE. The cornbread was dry and bland. Main dish: $32 full slab of ribs and cole slaw....The ribs are frozen out of a box and heated up. The cole slaw...don't even get me started. First of all, if you are a BBQ joint, you should be able to at the very least, serve acceptable cole slaw.. The slaw was so bland. I mean bland doesn't even cut it. Tasted like paper? I have eaten at several BBQ joints around phoenix and this one is bad, sorry to say. We told the staff the food was awful and we can't eat it. I don't like to complain and refuse to pay for food at a restaurant, but there was no way I was paying over $50.00 for arguably some of the worst food I have ever had. But hey, the waiter was really nice about it and apologized so, that was a plus...Go to BOBBY Q's. You won't regret it. Top 3 best rack of ribs I have ever had and for less money."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to enjoy some Happy Hour after a round of golf. The bartender, Larry, was great in his recommendation of beers and amazing tacos as an appetizer. You've got to stop by here and see Larry and the staff. Try the Boot Dumplings as well as the special apple moonshine!"}
{"text":"OK... so comfortable and fun coming back here....lovely quiet relaxed atmosohere....pork belly tacos still my favorite...the smoked wings were good too...wine good....everything good. ...we will be back...definitely!  Thank you so much to Kiki who is always welcoming and smiles all the time....which is sometimes hard to find"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and really enjoyed the Classic Burger, was great with their homemade potato chips"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good food but I have one complaint.  It's not food related and I'm sure a lot of people will find this very trivial.  The metal chairs/stools are so noisy scraping across the floor!  It would be great if they would put some rubber/plastic things on the legs."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to make it to the soft opening of Bootleggers this last weekend.  Everything I tried was amazing!  The corn on the cob was out of this world!    The atmosphere was unique and comfortable, homey but still classy.  The wood for the walls and the grating over the bar made for a warm (yet super cold A/C!) experience.    I am excited to return and try new, wonderful BBQ dishes that were all over the menu!"}
{"text":"Bootleggers in downtown Scottsdale was a terrific meal. I loved the ambiance; classy, yet comfortable, and inviting.  I started with the bacon board, and OH MY GOSH it was AWESOME!  I usually will go with a classic burger to judge an establishment, and this did not disappoint. One of, if not the best I've ever had. This thing was huge. I am not a drinker, but the people I was with raved about their moonshine cocktails.  Don't be in a hurry. Relax and enjoy.  Run, don't walk to try this place out.  A+++"}
{"text":"I do not like my food on a wood board I do not like my food in a jar I would like my food on a plate  Very much dislikd that my food was served on a board- hipster would likely call it a plank. The butter on my steak ran off the steak, off the board, under the board and all over my arm.   Blue cheese dressing just tasted like mayonnaise.   If you sit in the back for large parties. The long bar tops are like being on a ship at high seas. The tables are on casters and on the night of our visit, the server was not successful in locking the wheels down.  Anytime someone in our party rested, touched or leaned onto the table, the table would give about 6\". It was a constant battle trying to keep the table centered. The back room has kind of a depressing and neglected feel.   Food was okay- not memorable.  Prices are steep for small portions. Server was polite.   Not likely to visit again."}
{"text":"I came here on a first date. Thank God for the bacon board, it made the whole experience bearable! I would definitely get that again.  The whole atmosphere is adorable and I would definitely sit at the bar next time. Thank you for the awesome food that made up for the lousy company!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and unique barbecue offerings. Staff is on pointe and their efforts were evident. Would highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Great smoked meats!  Now has the option to take out bulk meats.  Would give it 5 stars but their take out menu is quite pricey."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is always delicious. The service is always great. The apply pie moonshine is pure magic. I'd recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch on a Saturday. There were only a couple of other people here, so maybe everyone else has realized the kind of place that bootleggers really is. First of all, we ordered the barbecue sampler for two. It cost $32 and took about 14 hours to arrive (they aren't kidding about smoking their meat for 10-14 hours). When it did finally arrive, the meal was pretty bad. Nothing stood out, and the meat was very fatty. In addition, the sausages were quite honestly cold. It was our worst eating experience on our trip to Arizona by a lot. We waited for an extremely long time for our check to come, and we were finally able to leave the restaurant. There are many other good places to eat around here. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Just tried for the first time on Saturday night....made an online reservation at 6:30 for 7:00...walked in the door and was seated on the spot.  The restaurant has a great vibe.  We ordered nachos, PBLT and my kids had grilled cheese sandwiches....I lived it up and had a flight of moonshine and really liked the caramel and apple pie!  The food had great flavor....such a nice change of pace to have great food in a great little local spot!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to the opening today for lunch. Took a few friends to back me up. Staff was great and the food was Amazing! We didn't have any drinks since we were on a lunch break but I plan to come back this weekend and see what kind of crowd they have. Its a perfect place to kick back without the Scottdale DJ's or the overpriced drinks. Just great food, I hope the bar staff is just as great! I will follow up after my return!"}
{"text":"Went to Bootleggers in Scottsdale last night with a group of six and had a wonderful experience. We arrived a little early and sat down at the bar where we were greeted by Jonathan the bartender. Although I wasn't a person that likes moonshine he did give a little orientation but I ordered my wine. My husband mentioned the beer he liked and Jonathan made a recommendation and gave him a sample of something he liked. He asked us if it was our first time there and we said yes. A co-worker had recommended the restaurant and also a few dishes to try. He said if this was a group that wouldn't mind sharing he gave a list of his favorites. When the others in the party arrived we stayed at the bar and interacted with Jonathan. One friend tried the Catdaddy Old fashioned which was really good (his coming from a wine drinker). Since we were already a half an hour past our reservation we decided we better go to our table.  We ended up being seated in the bar area and yes, Jonathan was our server also. He came to the table and placed the order eye had discussed at the bar. We started with the carnitas nachos and the bacon board. The bacon board had five kinds of bacon and three different sauces. Who doesn't love bacon? This was fabulous. For the family style main meal we ordered the BBQ sampler, kale salad, mac & cheese, asparagus and green beans. This was one of the best meals I've had out in a long time.  To finish off the meal we had the Puerto Rican egg nog, this drink was soooo good and I want to know how they made it. The fresh nutmeg capped off a perfect drink. The group all agreed that we would return again."}
{"text":"Heavens me, that was a great burger!  Service was attentive and helpful.  Music was spot-on.  Beer selection was decent, could offer more distinct/local beers.  Yes, this used to be the dirty drummer.  Dispel all notions of that dive from your head.  Bootleggers has nothing in common with it."}
{"text":"Despite the location (in an older strip mall at Shea and the 51)  once you step inside there is a rustic modern decor with cool lights, wood and metal accents, and clean lines.  I like that while televisions are available, they are not over the bar.  There are about a dozen tap handles ranging from pilsners to IPAs and more bottled beer on ice. The wine selection appeared decent, but the star as far as beverages go is the cocktail menu.  The mixologists are friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic.  I hope to someday try one of everything then move on to whatever the staff wishes to create. We could smell the BBQ from the parking lot.  I judge all BBQ by the brisket. Theirs was nicely smoked and moist, but it was served pre-sauced with a thin sweet coating.  I prefer a great dry rub myself, but it didn't slow me down any. The happy hour tacos (3) were small but tasty and made a complete meal when accompanied by a shared side order. I will go back for the ribs. There were more regulars than not at least during happy hour (7 days a week). It seems like a great place to meet friends, stop in for a beverage after work, or spend a quiet date night if you, like me, also find BBQ romantic. My waistline and my liver are happy they are 20 miles away."}
{"text":"I had dinner the other night. It was expensive and the place was a bit pretentious. There was no combo platter for dinner; it was only available as lunch. The brisket was good, though not superlative. The slaw was ok. The tortillas were a nice touch. There was limited (i.e. one) selection of barbecue sauces, though it was pretty tasty.  I'd recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town we were referred to this gem of a spot.  Larry the bartender hosted us with a professional style you would expect at a fine dinning restaurant while still being personable and entertaining.  Great knowledge of the menu and the food to boot was off the hook. Bacon platter is a must as well as the brisket     So good we went back the next day for items we missed the first visit.   A must if you're here in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm from Chino Hills California visiting friends and we were deciding on dinner. They mentioned Bootleggers but I first had to check Yelp rating; it was a 4 star. That was perfect because I will not entertain an establishment less than 4 star. Well, Bootleggers is a 5 star in my opinion  The Bacon Board was incredible. I then ordered the Pan Seared Salmon; incredible from start to finish  The side dish of broccoli was delicious! Our entire group loved their dishes as well. The servers were friendly,  timely and friendly. I am now waiting for the peach/blueberry cobbler."}
{"text":"After hearing some reviews on this place I thought I would give it a try. The dinner here as a whole was a failure. The food came out at all different times, Drinks took forever to arrive, as did other items and I won't be back. Seemed like the restaurant was way understaffed. The food was good but not worth the horrible service."}
{"text":"I love the interior... very relaxed vibe. Everyone makes you feel right at home. My brother and I look forward to our next Moonshine sampling adventure!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. John our sever was awesome. Can't wait to come back to eat the tacos and brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness.   Came here twice in two days on a two day vacation to Scottsdale, that's how much we liked it. Everything we ate and drank was incredible. Seriously. The meat sampler plate is a great thing to try since you get lots of variety. And the moonshine is wonderful too. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but it is a bar/restaurant so pretty loud.  We had a reservation and were seated quickly. My group really enjoyed the pulled pork sandwiches and the regular fries are amazing!  Would not recommend the peach cobbler as it was just ok. Too sweet and not much flavor. Also the ice cream melted really quickly and it ended up really soupy. Overall experience though was very good."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since it opened a few months ago. Its in the same spot that Praying Monk used to be. Love the rock shrimp appetizer, bacon board and nacho flat. I have also had the chicken dish, short rib (out of this world) and a few of the barbque sandwiches, pulled pork and brisket. They have had a bit of turnaround with staff, that's expected with any new place, but there are 1 or 2 that are still there since the  beginning. One of the best and original ones is a server named Kaylyn. I know this because I always wind up taking half of the short rib home, its a pretty big piece, and she always puts her name and the date on my leftover box. She says so I'll remember when I put the box in the fridge, although it never makes it past the next days lunch. If you go, ask for Kaylyn and ask her for recommendations * we read another review that said the same thing and we took their advice. She claims she has tried everything on the menu and so far she hasn't steered us wrong. Once Spring Training starts we will be weekly regulars."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.  Perfect date night with my husband!"}
{"text":"Great! Too bad they lost the Jell-O shots. Love their food. Not the best short rib though. Too tough."}
{"text":"We were very excited about the opening of this restaurant. Unfortunately, we thought the food and service was worth only one star.    The restaurant was not super busy but steady when we arrived. The hostess was nice and immediately walked us to our table.  The staff was rude and very short. Our server never checked on us to see if we needed anything. If we were lucky enough to be able to flag someone down to ask for refills; we never saw them again. We watched several people at different tables get up and leave because the service was so bad. These folks just threw cash on table for there drinks and left.   As for the food, it was cold and did not look appetizing. For the same money, we would rather go to Houston's...you always get great food and service.   We do not understand how this place received the amazing reviews."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to go for dinner and found this place. When you first get into the plaza it does not look like anything special. Once you walk in you know your in for a treat. This place looks awesome and smells like goodness!!!!!!! Our food was outrageously good and the service was top notch. We will definitely be back!!!!!!! Actually, I'm planning my next trip there in my head as we speak!!!"}
{"text":"I live fairly close to bootleggers, but seem to be passing it all the time as I'm passing through town....always stop in! Love this place, the food, the drinks, the people, the atmosphere, highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try somewhere new and this was a good choice! Everywhere I eat I try to order the pulled pork sandwich so finding somewhere like this was amazing!  The atmosphere was awesome. The drinks were good. The service was a little bit slow but it was made up for in their delightful attitude. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the express lunch . Brisket was dry and pull pork was also dry. Had a jack on rocks. Seven dollars for the JACK Two dollars for the ROCKS?"}
{"text":"For this being the first time here, it was amazing! Though slow for a lunch, we were greeted promptly and told we could sit wherever we like. We chose the high booths inside! Anyways, service was very good and every time we asked our server a question, he knew what he was talking about. The food quality was perfect. My burger came out exactly as I liked and the sweet potato fries tasted homemade! Though it was expensive for two, you get what you pay for! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. Ordered the bbq sampler and it was average taste and lukewarm."}
{"text":"The staff was fantastic and the bartender here was very friendly and knowledgeable. The food was not my favorite for a BBQ place, but the prices were fair and my friend really loved his meal. Based on my friend's review I would say to try the bone in pork chop."}
{"text":"Go there once a week ! Awesome atmosphere , great staff , food rocks ! Can't beat it ! Modern BBQ w amazing salads !"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  The pulled pork was actually quite tasty and the drinks were good, but the brisket and ribs were absolutely dreadful!  Frankly, if you like this brisket, you have never had good (or even decent) brisket!  By the way, the Old Town location was completely dead on a Sunday evening!"}
{"text":"Wow! there are so many great things that come to mind when I think of this place. My friend was in town and had a limited diet. We went to Bootleggers and was blown away by the quality of service down to the last detail of making sure the ingredients didn't conflict with their diet. I don't normally order smoked turkey, mostly because it's generally dry, but this was so juicy and succulent that I complimented the waiter a few times and recommended it to a group as I was leaving. When you are there you must try their apple pie moonshine, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Bacon and Bbq? Yes and yes! Great service and food. We got the bacon board that comes with three different sauces (the one with dr. pepper was my fave) and the bbq sampler with the flour tortillas. Definitely more than enough food for two- we took home leftovers and still tasted good the next day. Our server was big into beers and brought out complimentary samples and we also got to try the moonshine which tasted very sweet and smooth. Outdoor seating was nice with a couple of TVs to watch some games that were on. The smell of the the cherry woods (that they use to make the bacon!) made the dining experience that much better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The service is on point. The food is amazing. If I didn't have to worry about staying fit, I'd eat here every day. The sausage, while spicy is so good. When I come here with my wife, we usually order the BBQ Sampler with a side of the mac and cheese which is enough to fill us up and give us leftovers to enjoy the next day.  Whether you are looking for a place to go with your significant others, or with a group of your friends, or wanting to go solo at the bar, you'll enjoy the food, drinks and ambiance."}
{"text":"Have now been to bootleggers twice and I will continue to go back. The food is amazing and same with the service. Tried the Apple Pie moonshine, which is their house moonshine, and it's prob the best drink I've ever had. Love the menu and BBQ choices. The ribs on the dinner menu are amazing and the grilled cheese add pulled pork for lunch was awesome. Will def come back and will recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome Sunday lunch. The food was excellent and our server John was very friendly and gave us great suggestions on what to order. The bloody Mary's are worth the trip alone! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Impressed - my favorite BBQ in Phoenix so far and definitely the best coleslaw I've ever had at a BBQ place. My boyfriend thought the sauce was a little sweet but it was perfect for me. One meat platter with one or two sides would be enough for two people."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone down hill fast.  So disappointed because it used to be great.   I knew something was wrong because it was empty on a Friday night.  Bacon board was fantastic,  but the price has increased,  moonshine was also great.   Terrible food......and it used to be good."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Monday night to celebrate my finances 40th birthday party. So it wasn't packed but they had a steady crowd.  I called ahead the week before to make the reservation since we had a total group of 13 coming.  They were willing to allow me to bring in my own cake and hold it until we were ready to serve.  The entire staff was super friendly and the service was excellent!  Now for the food:  For appetizers we ordered: The Boot Dumplings, yum. Nacho Flat, yum. Bacon Board, yum but a little over priced at $24 for the amount that they brought out. Not sure I would order again at this price point. Hickman Deviled Eggs - there were only 3 and for $6.00 that seems a little high.  Drinks: I had the Flapper $11.00, and it's dangerous, I had one but could have easily done three since it was so smooth, a little sweet but I like that. My finance had the Cat Daddy Old Fashioned $10.00 and he liked it, since I was driving he did have three. My future in-laws tried the Boot Flight - Moonshine $10.00 and had the White Lightning, Blackberry, and Hunch Punch.  They let us sample some too and in general most liked the Blackberry the best.  Dinner: We shared the BBQ Sampler for 4 - $60.00 and that is worth the price.  There was enough to get a good taste of everything on the menu, so it works out to $15.00 a person which is very reasonable.  The sides are separate and we tried the Mac & Cheese $5.00 which was tasty. We ordered two since we shared the sampler with the future in-laws and it was enough with everything else.  While a few items were overpriced for the amount you received in all the place was nicely decorated, the lighting was nice, the drinks, apps, and food all tasted good.  If you're looking for something a little different it's worth the time to check the place out."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Horrible food!! Only good thing was the moonshine. Not even deserving of the one star. All of the food orders for our party came out wrong. Our waiter was too busy to care or help. WILL NEVER RETURN!! Serious way to ruin a date night!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Things to try: the sriracha honey chicken wings and the fried chicken sandwich! Totally worth our money. I wish it was cooler at the restaurant, felt muggy and hot in there, maybe dropping the degrees on the thermostat would've helped."}
{"text":"Bootleggers a have to stop in Scottsdale AZ. Larry the bartender great host, and recommended some great food and drinks. 5 stars service."}
{"text":"Online search for a raved about, but cozy bar and eatery led us here initially.  Surprised to find such a classy venue with excellent chow almost hidden in the elbow corner of a strip mall, immediately adjacent to the 51 East of Shea.  Large, free parking lot steps from the door. Warm greetings from the staff. Great furniture. Flat screens all around for sports watching.   Small menu but everything interesting and tasty - we've tried most items over time. Love the Apps - including deviled eggs and (yum) gourmet bacon board.  Beers from everywhere, although this is cocktail heaven - including a row of Moonshine choices.  Bloody Mary's outstanding - they'll make you one that includes a quality mini cheeseburger on top!  It's been on our list of regular \"go to's\" for around 3 years now."}
{"text":"Best ribs ever! They? were super tender but still nice and meaty. The brisket was awesome as well. Very tasty BBQ sauce on the side. Also really liked the seasoned \"cottage fries\" - they were like a potato chip / fries hybrid. Oh and the coleslaw was great too, the right balance of creamy and tangy. All around a great meal!"}
{"text":"Food is of great BBQ quality. I had the PBLT with a fried egg. It came with a thick piece of pork belly and the yolk of the egg made it brunch overload deliciousness. Also tried the brisket sandwich best brisket I've had since being in Texas. The cottage fries were amazing!!!! Drinks were great--must try the Bloody Mary on Sunday which is a real treat."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great ambiance, the barbecue is delicious, happy hour is great (brisket tacos are awesome), and it's a great place to get a drink. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had a phenomenal burger here. The pretzel bun and all of the silly barbecue coleslaw burger mash is phenomenal. They have an apple moonshine that tastes like apple pie and a glass... The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is its a $12 burger."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time last Thursday night for dinner as it was a convenient location before my kickball league down the road. I will be going back every Thursday. Food was great, fantastic happy hour specials and JOSH  our server was the best. He even brought over a bucket to our table for some flowers to stay fresh! Cool little neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Hubs and I went there for dinner. We sat on the patio which isn't very big, but they had the fire going and it was nice and cozy. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful w/answering questions. I had a house whiskey and Sierra Mist which was delic and hubs had a beer. Hubs had the Triple B, which caused me to almost fall over when the waiter explained has a meatloaf style texture. Hubs doesn't do meatloaf! It was a full moon...we're going to have to blame it on that... I had the St. Louis Ribs. According to my hubs, the TB is the bomb! He loved it. My ribs were fall off the bone tender and all meat. Ummmm! Hubs chose the grilled asparagus for his side and I chose the mac & cheese and both were very good. Overall, everything was awesome. The only reason for the four stars is b/c they seated a party of eight, LOUD, rowdy (and not in a good way) Cubs (sorry Cubs BBall team, not trying to offend you) fans next to us. We could hardly talk over their yacking/inappropriate cussing at everything!!! Thankfully, this was towards the end of our meal and we were able to escape quickly and save our casual/romantic date night!!!"}
{"text":"First, I didn't order the right things. I ordered the shrimp and grits appetizer with a side of grilled asparagus for lunch. My lunchmates ordered salads. I should have ordered a salad.  Second, I ordered a dessert -- the berry cobbler with ice cream. Nothing else appealed to me.   If I have an opportunity to return, I will because I don't think I ordered the right things. It's a BBQ joint and I ordered shrimp? But I didn't want to go too heavy mid-day and get sleepy. After 6 p.m., a moonshine cocktail and a brisket sandwich might sit better.   The ambiance was great, very artsy and hipster cool. But again, midday was not the great time to go. It was empty, but our server was amazingly attentive because of the dearth of people. Let me try this place again later."}
{"text":"We went here for my boyfriend's birthday and loved it. They didn't have the bacon board available (which made me so sad), so I need to get back i and try that. I must say the apple pie moonshine is fantastic. I was told the owner makes it at his home. That is some burly ass shit. My boyfriend had the brisket and I had the grilled cheese (because I eat like a 12 year old). Both were good. I'll definitely be back for more of that moonshine and to try the bacon board."}
{"text":"We discovered this neighborhood place a couple of months ago and have been back five times!!! The menu and food are fabulous!  The atmosphere is fun and much different than you would expect in a little restaurant in a strip mall!  The mix of wood and modern is very inviting!  Our waitress this time was Stacie and she was outstanding! We have tried the tacos, the meats, the sides, sandwiches and wines!  The bacon board and deviled eggs are favorites of my husband and son for starters!  Vegans will have no problem finding wonderful items on this varied and delicious menu!  We'll be back again soon and may even try the location in Old Town Scottsdale which is close to my husband's office!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We visited about an hour before the kitchen was closed and three items I tried to order was not available . I was a little disappointed but my husbands Ribs were good. Overall I would try them again ."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick drink and small bite, and was pretty surprised. The only reason why I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars is because I did not get to taste very much on the menu, but based off of service and cocktails, I was definitely pleased. The bartender allowed me to sample different drafts until I found one I enjoyed, and was very accommodating in regards to my special requests from the menu. Will definitely be back to try the bacon platter!"}
{"text":"Yea, I know. I'm the guy that ordered a burger at a BBQ place. Glad I did. It was fantastic. Perfectly cooked with a great blend of toppings.  I'm definitely a burger junkie and this is in my top 3.   My friend had the bacon plate. Like nothing I've seen. Delicious.   The ambience also helps. I hate places that are too bright or so dim you can't see your meal.  This place is just right.   Our service might have been a bit slow for some people. But I prefer not to rush my dining experience.  If you are in a hurry, don't go out to eat.   The menu has lots to choose from. I'm excited to try the rest of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is nothing to rave about, especially the Brisket.  Super dry and not even hot when it arrived.  That's the other thing, we waited for our food for over 45 minutes, and we also noticed a couple of more tables right beside us that had the same problem; they also didn't get their food for a long time.  I wouldn't say the service was bad, I think the kitchen was very slow.  They said the Mac 'N Cheese was the favorite, but we all agree it was just ok.  Again for the Brisket, if you noticed there are tons of review here saying the same thing, that it is very dry...if you like Brisket I would say skip it and go to other place like Rudy's or even Famous Dave's, they have better food if you ask me.  You've been warned.   (I do hope the manager or the owner see's all the review here regarding their Brisket, and do something about it, they need to realize their Brisket is very dry and not good unless you put barbecue sauce on it).  Definitely not coming back here, and not recommended.  P.S. I would have given only one star, but the other star I would admit, is for the moonshine.  They are pretty tasty and very good.  It made one of our Doctor friends very happy!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place we waited 20 minutes, not one server came to our table, the people in front of us went to get there own plates since the server didn't bring them any for there appetizer. We got up and left, while walking out the door the manager did offer a gift card but no thanks we won't be back ."}
{"text":"Can't say one negative thing about this place. The boyfriend and I stopped in for a happy hour/lunch around 3:30 pm and were immediately greeted by the bartender/server. He probably had the best personality and attitude I have ever come across while dining out. He answered every questions and offered suggestions and did not hesitate to supply samples of the moonshine and beer.   Upon sampling the apple pie moonshine, my taste buds went into overload; it was incredible! yet a bit on the sweet side for me, but the bartender easily fixed this by mixing in some of the original moonshine. They offer a great variety of beers on tap as well.  I ordered the brisket taco and pork belly taco, each $3 on the happy hour menu, and my boyfriend had the smoked turkey breast. The smoked turkey breast was delicious, but we would both recommend trying the BBQ at this place. The smell alone outside the establishment will get your mouth watering. The meat on the tacos was extremely tender and flavorful; melt-in-your-mouth quality. The coleslaw was also extremely fresh, crunchy, and packed great flavor.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere and the decor is upscale industrial  steampunk/western. I will definitely be returning and highly recommend this place to anyone who loves and appreciates true BBQ and a good drink!"}
{"text":"Great food other than the coleslaw. Tastes like an unfinished salad. Needs some flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing service with wait staff and bartenders that are friendly and always eager to provide a recommendation. The quality of the BBQ food is always exquisite, it's prepared perfectly and the portions are just right. Fun selection of moonshine."}
{"text":"Just had a delicious meal here with another couple and we all had a great time. I enjoyed the 75 cocktail and my husband had old chub (on nitro, not typical for a restaurant) and they were both great.   While the bacon appetizer looked tempting, I don't think I could have stomached five types of bacon plus more meat as an entree so we opted out of it, but it looked amazing at the table next to us. I had the St. Louis style ribs and my husband had the brisket. The smoke ring on the ribs was perfectly pink and smothered in a sticky sweet and spicy barbecue sauce. It was really delicious, my only wish was that it was warmer. It came with a tortilla and I had forgotten to ask for the biscuit instead but the tortilla was super good. It came with a side of cole slaw that I enjoyed - not too creamy, a little bit more vinegary, and really let the flavors melt together. I also got a side of the smashed potatoes and they were insane. My friend got them as well and as we both took a bite, we knew shit just got real. The icing on the cake? About half way through our meal our waiter came up to our table with an extra drink the bar had made (the blueberry one) and gave it to us. Woohoo!   The atmosphere of the restaurant is really great, a cool rustic meets 50s style with just the right pops of color in the right place. If you're looking for a cool place to grab dinner in old town and you like smoky meats and western style with a little hipster flair, bootleggers is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Our first experience with Bootleggers was at the Arizona Taco Festival. Their street tacos were among our favorites, so we decided we needed to add their restaurant to our list of places to try. When we found out their Phoenix location was less than 15 minutes from our house, it made it a no-brainer. We have been to Bootleggers three or four times now, and each time has been great.  We always start off with the Bacon Board, which features five different types of bacon, along with two relishes, house mustard (inexplicably my favorite), cheesy bread, and pickles.  They put their own spin on Chicken and Waffles, which is their Monday dinner special. You get three big pieces of fried chicken and a giant waffle that is flavored with jalapeno and cheddar. The accompanying syrup was more on the savory side but still a bit sweet, and paired perfectly with the waffles.  My hubby's favorite item is the Bootlegger Burger, their daily special. The burger is always cooked as ordered (medium, in our case), the pretzel bun is nice and soft, and the toppings (muenster cheese, thick-cut bacon, onions, mushrooms, etc) add lots of flavor.  Their selection of moonshine is tasty, though the servings are a little on the small side. I'd recommend ordering their cocktails instead, as all the ones we have tried are nice and strong, and equally tasty.  Service can be a little slow at times, but servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"First time visit tonight (A Saturday night). It's a really nice place inside, but still casual. I like that they have some good craft beers, not just the usual domestics. The place will gain more popularity, I'm sure, but they do have some kinks to work out. The waitress told us the St. Louis ribs were pork. Luckily the co-owner(?) clarified that they're beef because I really only like pork ribs. The nachos are killer, with big chunks of beef. The corn appetizer is awesome. Our burger was good. Our bill was $56 for nachos, corn appetizer, 4 craft beers, and bootlegger burger (shared). Service was a  little sketchy. It took a little while to get another beer, and to get our order in. To be honest I think we just got the 3rd string waitress. But we'll definitely be back. Great food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food. Kailey was our server, really sweet gal. I am vegan so she checked with the cook and got my food exactly right. My husband loved the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous waiter, Dallas, at the very beginning and ordered from him. But we decided to move to the band area for dinner. Even though we were in another servers area, Dallas continued to check to see if we were enjoying the food. My husband ordered the steak and I ordered the French Dip. Per my husband, his steak was great. However, after eating half of my French Dip sandwich, I had to pull slices of fat out of my sandwich and mouth. When Dallas checked again, I told him it had to go back and to tell whomever made the sandwich to please...\"no fat\". Dallas was so sorry and returned moments later with another French Dip. Same thing...more fat. I began to think whoever fixed another French Dip, they transferred the meat from the other half of my first sandwich I had returned to a new roll. Again, Dallas check and I told him there was still lots of fat in my sandwich. Again, he apologized and was extremely sorry. I told him it wasn't his fault. I will not every order another French Dip again. Beer was good however. Note: Dallas is one of the best servers we've encountered in a long time. Now, Chart House has the best French Dip...tender and no fat!!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with food. There is far more better bar food else where. But enjoyed the band very much. Server was excellent."}
{"text":"Our second visit here and it is fantastic! Great cocktails and beers but the BBQ IS OUT OF THIS WORLD! D don't  miss this place"}
{"text":"Bacon board....   Let me say it again- bacon bored.   Sure it's pricy but it's amazing!   The rest of the food is awesome and the prices aren't bad for scottsdale old town - but the bacon is why we come"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant.  Reluctant to let the valley know how great the smoked meats are in this place. If you want your \"fix\" of tender lightly smoked turkey, pork, or my favorite the brisket, this will become your favorite restaurant.  The appetizers and side dishes also yummy.  I would love them to expand their dessert menu, which is limited. The drinks are nicely presented.  Service is friendly and attentive. Just wish restaurant was bigger because it can get noisy from happy hour through dinner. If you want a quieter experience, you should go for a delightful lunch. They have a great kale salad, which is my favorite in the valley."}
{"text":"We had a grea time here. Food was excellent and the service was fabulous! Try the bacon board as the appetizer! Crafted cocktails are great."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Bootleggers after racking our brains for something to eat tonight, it never fails, six o'clock rolls around and the \"what do you feel like eating\" starts to run out of our mouths. We had just gotten to the point of \"I'm so hungry I don't even know what I want anymore\" when we decided to stop in. I am so glad we did!! The brisket did not disappoint! Ours was served wet, I felt totally indulgent eating the fat on the meat, but it was too good. The Cole slaw is awesome and the BBQ sauce, served on the side, was incredible! We ordered the sweet potatoes fries to share and the maple aioli they come with is seriously insane! We left with our bellies brimming with fullness and a new favorite haunt to add to the weekly rotation. Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"We live just down the road and first came here the day it opened- my husband happened to remember it was opening.  Their menu was pretty select at first as they were testing a few things out.  In the testing stage, it was good (limited BBQ though) and we were able to offer feedback on the dishes we got.  We came back a couple weeks later and they had added more.  Even better than the first time and more BBQ.  They now have a full menu w/ lots of BBQ and we've eaten off of it a few times now.  It's all really good.  I had the turkey melt last night (with smoked turkey-- no deli meat here) and added avocado.  It was really freaking good.  My husband had the side of mac and cheese and a side of asparagus... don't ask... but he loved them both and was full.  They serve great beer (including Four Peaks, my favorite) on draft amongst a bevy of other things.  We would really like to see this place succeed, especially because they finally poured money into remodeling this place.  Since we have lived in the area (since July 2011), that place has been about 5 different things (and previously was the old dirty drummer long ago) and every owner kept it the same dumpy place inside and just changed the name.  Now it's actually a cool spot to go hang out at, even if it's just to enjoy a beer or two.  Wait staff is friendly and you can smell the BBQ from the parking lot.  You should definitely try this place out.  We've been at least a half a dozen times and will keep going back."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I may not go back just because of the server, Josh.  He was loud, over-confident and referred to us as \"hon\", \"young lady\", \"girl\".  I'm 63 years old so definitely not a young lady or \"girl\" and I'm definitely not his \"hon\".  Aside from all that... we got there at 5:48pm and the hostess gave us the happy hour menu which showed happy hour was from 3 - 6pm...which prompted me to look at my watch to see if we were \"in time\"... again, it was 5:48.  Josh promptly brought 6 waters to the table and promptly left.  There were only 3 other tables with guests. Even though it wasn't busy, he didn't come back until 6:02 and we asked \"does happy hour still apply\"?  He looked at his watch and said \"no hon, it ends at 6pm and it's 6:02\".  To which we replied, we've been here since 5:48.  He said \"sorry, hon, our computers turn it off at 6, so even if I tried to put it in, the computer will reject it\".  At that point we should have asked to see the manager, but we decided we didn't want to make a scene, so let it drop.  We were all infuriated... it's not about the $2 per drink we would have saved, but the idea that we were there in plenty of time for happy hour and he was rude about it.  He says he usually doesn't work on Saturday's, so IF we go back, it will definitely be on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Great wine list and over cooked dry meat! The place lacked any character to back up the nicely remodeled place. In short...dont waste your time."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service! Chase, our server was on the ball! I drank only water due to dr's orders but I will be back to do the moonshine smpler! I had the brisket and pulled pork with cole slaw. It was fantastic. The wife had the pulled pork sandwich and homemade chips! You guys have a good thing here! And Chase is a keeper, don't loose him. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Bacon bacon bacon! Oh my the bacon board was delish!!!   Super cute place! Service was great, ambience was cozy and food was delicious!! Definitely a hidden find in the heart of old town. Saw it on check please Arizona and had it marked as a place we wanted to try. So happy that we stumbled in it after the giants spring training game. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time to bootleggers and it has blown me away. Larry our bartender was phenomenal and incredibly hospitable. The apple pie moonshine was by far the best I've ever had!  The pulled pork sandwich was divine and cooked to perfection. BBQ can sometimes be salty but Bootleggers has done it right. It was tantalizingly tasteful without being drowned in sauce. A true testament to smoked meat at its best.   I highly recommend bootleggers.. Especially on a lazy afternoon if Larry's bar-tending!"}
{"text":"Not what we expected and not worth the money.  There is better BBQ for less money in Phoenix.  We tried Bootlegger's because we like to try new restaurants and this is near our home.  We sat at a high top and the tables and chairs were cool, but the table very wobbly.  This would not have been a big deal but you have to CUT their 16 hour brisket and 14 hour pulled pork.  Why do you have to cut pulled pork?  the whole table shook and drinks were spilled while cutting meat that should not need to be cut.  In their favor the draft beer and wine selection is good and the decor hipster cool.  If eating at a hip place is more important to you than the food, you might make this a three star, but we eat out for the food, not to be seen in a hip place."}
{"text":"Kyle gave us great service.  Music is 80's rock.  Ambiance is nice.  Food was excellent.  Had dumplings,wings, tacos, deviled eggs and chips and guacamole on Happy Hour menu.  Delicious with a unique taste and spin on old classics.  Will be back soon to try the smoked prime rib."}
{"text":"Great service..... Very quick and good knowledge on the menu.  Really good food, the nacho flat and the rock shrimp and grits were both very tasty. Would come back and tell a friend."}
{"text":"Spectacular service and phenomenal food. Had the pulled pork sandwich and asked for the BBQ sauce on the side which was a great idea. Allowed for me to taste the smoked pork on its own better and then add the BBQ sauce (which is so tasty) if I wanted it. Ordered the \"cottage fries\" which are described as seasoned yukon gold potatoes and they were delicious. Our server (who we think was the owner) was incredibly helpful and engaging. Oh, and it smelled amazing in there. I would go in just for the free smells."}
{"text":"Fun surprise in a strip mall. Cute place, good service and tasty food. House made apple pie moonshine is worth a try."}
{"text":"Traveling USA trying BBQ for many years now it is rare I get impressed . as  a KCBS judge commercial  restaurants  have a hard time putting out competition worth BBQ. So my standard to put all others is Franklin BBQ in Austin Tx.  So will say I am really impressed with bootleggers.. first test can the meat stand on its own without sauce?  Yes brisket was perfectly cooked with a great combination of smoke and a wonderful moist bark. Pulled port ditto perfectly cooked moist flavorful without sauce. Ribs tender moist juicy a slight pull from the bone.. excellent .. the sausage was spicy but not to hot and was moist  and juicy without being fatty .. turkey which I usually shy away from was my least favorite item but was ok. Slaw was homemade , fresh crisp and nicely done. Service very good prompt and attentive ... atmosphere  welcoming. Overall concept and menu impressive. Bar has it all 20 beer taps , wine, infused moonshines, anything you can think up.  Brisket highly recommended as  out of hundreds restaurants I have tried would put it in top 5 . Will definitely return if in area as numerous other items on menu I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"This could be a really good place for BBQ. COULD BE.  Slightly overcooked and dry on the pulled pork; steak was nicely done; portions at lunch were a little small for the price - probably the Old Town Scottsdale premium."}
{"text":"The beautiful ambience, the amazing patio, the great cocktails... no, what I appreciated the most about this restaurant was the vegetarian options. How often is it that a place which considers themselves a smokehouse also has vegetarian options? BRAVO!"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was nothing spectacular. The portion sizes seemed rather small also. We would not return."}
{"text":"Food, drinks and service were spot on.. manager hooked us up with some brisket nachos from a mess up order which were amazing and some sample apple pie moonshine for dessert! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had thed magic LocalDines coupon for $50 of what we hoped would be a food delight. Had reservations for 5:30pm and were seated quickly.  Place is nice inside, casual yet modern,  My first complaint was the lighting was so dim it was very very hard to read the menu, place needs to turn up the wattage a little.  After reading how great the food was we had to start with the bacon board..  Price has already gone up $3 which seems to be a trend on the majority of the menu,  Pulled pork was $8 now $11, brisket now $12 and I think it used to be $10.  The real problem was that the food in our opinion was not up par if compared to the prices,  The bacon board was served in semi darkness.  The waitress explained what each componet was so we would know what we were eating,  Overall I liked the various types of bacon, only one type was overcooked, the dipping sauces were great and well as the toast., but the real question was it worth $16, not to us but it was worth a try just to say we've had it,  Wife ordered chipped brisket sandwich with coleslaw on it and I order the pulled pork with slaw (my favorite way to eat pulled pork).  She enjoyed her sandwich, however mine had no spice, no punch, just grease!  Now I enjoy grease but you have to have bbq sauce with it.  My pulled pork just lacked flavor, what I get at Pork On A Fork is far superior BBQ overall.  Ordered a couple of sides: cole slaw, lacked salt and spice, the roasted asparagus where very thin and nothing special.  Both sandwiches were served with thick warm potatoe chips which I nibbled on while waiting for the check.  Didn't quite spend al $50 but I had enoughj.  My wife wants to return so I may give it the second chance the couple sitting next to us they gave it and were definitely they did,  As for me this weekend I'll take my two coupons to Pork On A Fork and eat some down home BBQ."}
{"text":"Party of four went for Wednesday night dinner. Items not available to order: beef brisket, fried chicken, pork chop. Service was excellent which somewhat offset the fact we couldn't try their signature brisket. Pulled pork was greasy and the bacon on the Bootlegger burger was undercooked. Side dishes were pretty flavorful. Overall a mediocre dining experience. Hopefully will be able to go back and try other dishes as the neighborhood location and atmosphere were desirable."}
{"text":"While I like the look of this place I'd say in my opinion I'd come more for a couple drinks as opposed to for great food.  Both times I've eaten here I've left underwhelmed.    The menu was limited, portions were on the smaller side, bbq lacked flavor and the water tasted like it was straight from the sink.  The sausage was good and flavorful but the brisket not so much.  Also dissapointing was that I wanted to ask for salt and pepper but waiter didn't check on us until we were already done with our meals."}
{"text":"This place has the best pulled pork sandwiches. The first time I had one I was in love. I actually dreamed about that sandwich later that night. The only real downside to thus place for me, is that it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I have to say Bootleggers offers a very nice atmosphere and nice service, but I stopped by on a Friday after work to find out there were no Happy Hours specials. That's a big negative since this place isn't sure whether it wants to be a \"date night\" dinner destination or a neighborhood pub. It resembles a smaller upscale Scottsdale restaurant, but the menu offers up mostly bar food. Ok, so looking at the beverage menu, it seems they have a nice beer selection. Too bad they were out of my first two choices. Oh well, I'll have to settle for my old reliable, Miller Lite. Whats's that...4 bucks?! Check please! Best of luck to you Bootleggers, I hope you make some wise changes before it's too late."}
{"text":"Bootleggers has a new chef. Looks like he takes pride in the product leaving his kitchen. After staying away from here for quite some time, I'm happy to say I'm back. I'll be eating my way through the menu. The bacon board and the nachos are always great and uniquely Bootleggers. The Apple pie moonshine is always a nice way to finish off they meal combining dessert and an after dinner drink."}
{"text":"I want to give more stars because the food was pretty amazing. The service was terrible so it diminished my experience and I probably will never return. The service was slow, disintrested and borderline rude, especially for the prices being charged...I expected a little bit more attention. We were never checked on after our food came out, they didn't bring tortillas, it took 20 minutes to get a drink from the bar. We waited a good 15 minutes after the check was dropped for the waiter to pick it back up. It really was irritating how the server would disappear and they weren't all that busy. The food on the other had was good, a little over priced for certain things, but good. The bacon board was fun to share as was the bbq sampler. The brisket was tender and smoky. I wish the service matched the food, then this place would be a winner."}
{"text":"I first came to Bootleggers as date treat from my boyfriend, and it certainly was a treat.   To start, the service was excellent -- fortunately we went on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't very busy, and we got to chat some with our waitress about the food and she gave us some fairly solid recommendations. I ordered a burger with pork belly that was so flavorful and delicious, I was almost sad when I finished it.   But the best part was the amazing appetizer we got. Two words: Bacon board. Literally a board with various different types of bacon, and it was wonderful in all kinds of ways. I could eat their applewood smoked bacon all day. Before we even walked out the door I was already asking my boyfriend when we'd be back -- which I'm sure will be very soon!"}
{"text":"Bootleggers has GREAT food!  My boyfriend likes the Boot Burger, while I prefer something healthier like the kale salmon salad.  Whether you want standard pub fare or healthier options, Bootleggers is a wonderful place to grab a beer and CHOW down some yummy stuff!  YAY!"}
{"text":"Love this area!! The atmosphere real nice in here. Cauliflower puree to die for!! No one ever has this dish and I LOVE IT!!!(cuz i dont eat potatoes/alternative YES!!)"}
{"text":"Not only are the food and drinks great, but the customer service was outstanding. We had the beef brisket, which was a very generous portion and had such a great flavor. I had the open faced turkey sandwich, which was awesome. Even the moonshine was delicious (apple pie). The Best part was that there was a drunk guy at the bar who pretty much fell off his barstool. His stool slowly fell backwards into me but I moved before it got to me. No big deal- I didn't get hit and I wasn't bothered but the manager came over so apologetic. He insisted on buying us a round. It was so nice."}
{"text":"A waitress sees me on Yelp and immediately offers me service... Horray..."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is always bad especially when the lady in charge on weekends is there. Friendly person but very slow and regularly ignores customers! Last several times there she is either on the phone, in the back or just plain ignores customers."}
{"text":"Ok, when was the last time you went to a restaurant and they had deviled eggs as an appetizer?  Well, here they do and they are delish!  My kids devoured them and wanted more.  The French dip, sirachia honey wings and sampler bbq dinner are all good.  OH, forgot to mention the kitchen sink quac...to die for!  The kids chicken strips and made fresh, no frozen strips here and were tender and juicy.  We will be back for sure to enjoy a night out without the kids :)  PS It was a little chilly both times I have been, so if you get cold, take a sweater!"}
{"text":"Excellent food (deviled eggs and tacos), drinks (Bloody Mary), and service! Ask for Jon when you visit, A++ server!"}
{"text":"I'm saving a star because the service was a little wonky. But the food, amazing! We started with the bacon board and it was impressive. Many different types of bacon and this delicious bacon jam that I could eat with a fork. Next we ordered the BBQ sampler for 4 which came with coleslaw and homemade, warm tortillas. The brisket and pulled pork were so tender and delicious. Plus, little pots of BBQ sauce were served on the side which were perfect. We ended the night with the Jack Daniel's brownie. It was good but a little dry. Service was not excellent. For a Wednesday night with many tables empty, we did not receive our apps or drinks in a timely manner. But we did get our wine for half off as that is their Weds night special. We'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Brisket was excellent, as well as the side of Mac and Cheese.. A bit smokey on the meat, but wouldn't change it!"}
{"text":"We cruised in on a Friday early evening. The 2 bartenders were attentive & fun to interact with. We had a couple of cocktails Old Fashioned & Four Peaks Peach & shot of JD & of course the hubs had to try the bacon board which was exactly what I expected delish cooked right bacon on well a board. there was some cheesy bread around & sauces too. I love me some bacon but the skinny bitch inside me kept saying stop eating it's bacon. I shut that little bitch up with more bacon. So just put on your big girl panties & eat. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"While the food was okay (not great) the service was poor and the bathrooms were dirty. Yuck! I had the St Louis ribs, which were pretty good. My husband had the beef brisket and half the portion was inedible fat. The Mac and cheese is yummy! Our server was slow and forgetful. She didn't know what whiskeys or bourbons they had available. And came back 10-minutes later to say they didn't have what we'd ordered.  She forgot to bring our starter salad, so our entrees arrived first. We then cancelled the salad which seemed to cause confusion. The same thing happened to the table next to us too.  She brought our bill without asking if we'd like anything else, and while I was still eating my entree. Rude! And they had open tables so I'm not sure why she was trying to rush us. And the bill was wrong! It still included the drink they didn't have available.  The women's washroom was decorated well with subway tile and a marble floor but it was dirty and only one side of the sink worked.  Wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"I can't say if the food was good, or if the cocktails were good. I can't say if anything was good, because I arrived just before 5, at almost 5:30 I finally got to order a drink (piggly wiggly. Was fine if overpriced) at 5:45 I finally got my drink. It wasn't very busy, there were multiple people working, and even if the waitress for my table of 5 was the only one there, the wait time was not acceptable.  The cocktails look fantastic. The food looks really good. But I never got any of it but one cocktail in an hour and a half. We left for another place because we weren't getting any drinks or food, and in the same time elsewhere we all got 2+ drinks, food, and dessert. It could very well have been just the person we had, and I hope so much that it is not usually like that, because the food and drinks look so good. If I go back and have a legitimate server who takes orders and fills them, then I will change this review accordingly."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love! Oh my goodness this place is awesome! The service is amazing, the moonshine is smooth, and they have a BACON BOARD. It is a tad expensive but DELICIOUS! Definitely an order for special events. I cannot wait to go back and try more and more!"}
{"text":"Our service was great! The deviled eggs amazing, although I didn't get why they were red... The ambiance was cool.  Potato chips, top notch. I should have ordered bbq as that is what they're known for! I had the Salmon BLT.  Don't order it. At least compensate with bacon. There was more lettuce than anything and the salmon was VERY MINIMAL. I was thinking it would be more of a salmon sandwich with bacon. It wasn't even a salmon fillet, but rather 3 tiny and thin pieces of salmon (how did they get pieced). I was disappointed about that."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Wings were dry and tasteless, brisket was full of fat, pulled pork was ok but with a strange after taste and the ribs were nothing more than ok. The coleslaw was good.  Service was un attentive when we were the only ones in the restaurant.  We won't be back :(  (Unfortunate because we really like BBQ)"}
{"text":"Wow!  So good! I wish it was in mesa instead of n. Phx.  Everything was great!  Really great. PBLT is a great sandwich, Mac n cheese is awesome!  My gent had pulled pork and potato salad and it was nothing less than perfect.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Between our family we had chicken strips, pulled pork, salmon tacos, and the salmon blt.  All were absolutely delicious.  The fries shaped like pickle slices were also fantastic, as was the guacamole appetizer.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ok I am from Texas so I know what a good brisket tastes like. You know that melts in your mouth with just the right smoke taste. Yeah that is what I am talking about. Well lower your expectations at this gig. Bought 1/2 lb for 18.99 lb at the Scottsdale farmer market today. They would not allow a sample. So I blindly bought in. The brisket looked good and moist. However is was way too salty when opened at home. Very disappointing. I should have known as no locals were lined up for purchases. Skip this when at the market."}
{"text":"Wow. In the midst of spring training chaos this was a welcome oasis. Great food, BBQ was great (I'm from Austin so I know something about BBQ), the poors were friendly and service was impeccable. I'll be back !"}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend and this was by far the best food and best service in Scottsdale!! Our waitress \"Kailey\" was so enthusiastic and attentive!! Would recommend this to anyone in the are!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. My husband said it was some of the top three BBQ he ever had along with salt lick in Austin and green street meats in Chicago. I had the pulled pork sandwich and I would agree with that cole slaw was great and I don't even like cole slaw most of the time!"}
{"text":"After living in Kansas City, we have finally found a restaurant in Phoenix with BBQ that compares.  The ribs were fall off the bone tender.  The sauce was was sweet rich and tangy.  The cocktails were a real treat.  the moonshine old fashioned with cat daddy moonshine, walnut bitters, and luxardo cherries was worth the trip alone.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been in more than a dozen times this year. The service is consistently stellar which has., for old town, is a huge statement. They don't fall asleep at the the wheel as soon when the snowbirds show up.  The food is on point, atmosphere is low audio but busy and they don't slack at the bar. These guys have old town dialed in"}
{"text":"Bacon board is a must try and the Moonshine flight is a great way to try out the various offerings.  I had the Cobb Salad...the pork belly was an amazing twist.  Waiter was knowledgeable and was happy to go through various options  and offer suggestions."}
{"text":"Two words... Steak Nachos (probably called something else).  The service was good but I was blinded by that dish.  They were very hospitable to a large professional group we were hosting there.  Nice place."}
{"text":"fast service and nice environment. I ordered the strawberry moonshine drink... it was very strong but tasty. I shared a house salad, brisket board, and potato circle fries with my boyfriend. That was plenty of food for 2 people. The brisket was a little dry but with the tortilla and cole slaw, it was very tasty."}
{"text":"This is a cool local restaurant - love the overall look and feel of it.  They're open 'til 1 or 2 am so I would definitely come back here in the future for drinks and hanging out.  The food was good.  We ordered the Bacon Board, St Louis Ribs, and Mac n Cheese.  The mac n cheese was reallllyyyy good.  Came out piping hot and had a nice crust on top.  The bacon board was very interesting, had about 5 or 6 different types of bacon with 2 different jams, bread and pickle.  There's no correct way to eat it,  you just kind of eat it how you want.  The ribs were good... great flavor but it couldve been a bit more tender and it wasn't hot, it was lukewarm.    The service was friendly - they weren't negligent or too bothersome.    I'd definitely come back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Bacon board charcuterie was on point! Nothing makes me happier than 1/2 off a bottle of wine, copious amounts of bacon, moonshine flights, BBQ ribs, burgers, Mac n cheez, and of course more moonshine. The staff was great and the bartender was an angel! Definitely be back for moonshine Monday's and hopefully a bit of Sunday brunch.. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"So the fiancé really loves BBQ, and I am a pretty big fan myself. Walking into Bootleggers I was immediately digging the decor and cool vibe they have going on. However, I thought for the price that the drinks were on the small side and the food was so-so. I ordered the beet salad, which was good but a bit sparse. I was happy that they let me put bbq'd meat on top. He ordered the brisket and was not impressed. More bbq sauce with the bbq entrees would have been good.  So, three stars it is for so-so food with an awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"My family and I love smokehouses. We were expecting so much from this restaurant especially after seeing all the positive reviews and delicious pictures. Sadly to say our experience fell short.  Our Kitchen Sink Guacamole is already browning once it got to our table and lacked flavor. We ordered Prime Beef Brisket which was sadly overcooked and dry. The Schreiner's Hot Links were actually very tasty and spicy which we all enjoyed. The Best Chicken Sandwich was very hard in texture which ruined the whole dish. The Bootlegger Burger was beautiful in presentation and looked like it was going to be mind blowing delicious. Sadly, it was just okay nothing memorable.  The service was nothing impressive. The manager seemed to be more involved with the customers than our waitress, who just visited us maybe 3-4 times.  We really hoped for the best but received the opposite. We don't plan on revisiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? Because we enjoyed some quality BBQ here!     ---   ---   ---  I'll spare you the details of how we got here, but it was one of those situations where you're trying to hoard about 15-20 people to dinner, which results in 15-20 different agendas, time frames, suggestions, preferences, etc. After what felt like hours of trying to formulate a plan, we chose to check out Bootleggers for two reasons:  1) It was close to our hotel.  2) They took Yelp Reservations!  When a restaurant takes Yelp Reservations, it makes life about 10,000x easier, so thanks Bootleggers for that! But onto the food:  -First off, our server was excellent. We ended up with a party of 8, that later expanded to a party of 10. James could not have made it look easier to handle our large group.  -Bacon Board: They have what basically amounts to a sampler platter of different kinds of bacon. How could a human being ever come to Bootleggers without ordering that? It was everything I'd hoped it would be.  -Apple Pie Moonshine: Same question as above. Same result as above.  -Pulled Pork: This was probably the one disappointment for me. It wasn't awful, but it was pretty run-of-the-mill pulled pork.  -Mac-n-Cheese: Absolutely wonderful.  -Coleslaw: I don't like coleslaw that's a bit dried out, and fortunately this was the opposite of that. It's weird to describe coleslaw as \"wet\" but that's exactly what it was.  Really, this experience was probably more of the 4.5 star variety for me. I'm only rounding down because the one thing that I felt missed the mark was the meat, and that should be the best part of a BBQ restaurant.  I'd definitely return on my next trip to the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Food lacked seasoning.     Ribs were ok nothing special.   Sauce tasted out of bottle average.    Pulled pork was average.   Needs seasoning.    Burger came with chips that completely lacked salt.    Server did not offer side dish options.    Nobody finished their plate.    Burger was pre made patty.   Lacked flavor.   Service not horrible but certainly not great.   Overall everything just average.    Tried twice to be fair.    Nothing to bring me back."}
{"text":"Bacon board and apple pie moonshine. Nuf said."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a meal here on a Saturday July 2 in the afternoon with 2 other adults and a 5 year old. The mixed drinks are really good, they have some good shine flavors. We shared a HUGE plate of nachos covered in brisket hash. Our table also ordered the wedge salad, 2 French dips and the kids cheeseburger. No complaints on those. The French dips came with this really good horse radish sauce. I did get a side of brisket for $6 that was kind of dry but the flavor was great. I will definitely be back. I wish I could remember our server's name, he was a young, charming guy that watched our table really well. We never had empty drinks and he inquired about the food when we got it and after we had a chance to eat it. Very good service."}
{"text":"This was our first time to visit. We had a large party and they were fabulous. Food was great. Service was great and you have to try the apple moonshine. It was fabulous. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Decided to come hear today, with my family, right after visiting the desert botanical garden. Arrived around late afternoon. Got seated right away. Our server Torrence immediately brought us water. He gave us a good amount of time before asking us for what we wanted to eat. Recommended traditional wings and bbq items which turned out great. Mac and cheese was also amazing. Overall experience was great very happy with the food and service."}
{"text":"My friends and I have had a chance to eat through the entire menu. If 3.5 stars were available, I'd surely award that many to Bootleggers.   Bootleggers would have done a heckuva lot better had they NOT included some rather large chunks of fat in their pulled pork servings. On the other hand, their brisket presents well, nice smoke ring and good bark on the outside. I'm still confused by the warm tortillas served with the pulled pork. That said, both these meats are somewhat bland with no sauce offered to flavor things up   The Bacon Board is a nice hook and a pleasant appetizer. But, the REAL reason to eat at Bootleggers is their St Louis-style ribs. Succulent, moist and meat-falling-off-the-bone good, these ribs present well with a discernible smoke ring and real nice rub. They compete favorably with Bobby-Q and Pork On A Fork. The Apple Pie Moonshine deserves an honorable mention.  The service for our visits was excellent and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. We sat at the bar and every seat was packed but still the one bartender rocked every order of food and drink quickly, efficiently and always with a smile and sense of humor even though you could tell he was in the weeds! What a PRO! Best BBQ in Scottsdale/PHX metro by far and I've been to them all. This is definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"Everything was OK here..not great, but OK.   I ordered the Dirty South for a cocktail which is made with their house infused blueberry bourbon.  It was pretty good, but ended up coming out with my meal, so I didn't really get to enjoy it.  Plus it was pretty expensive, even for Scottsdale ($14).  We ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer.  Again OK, just nothing exceptional.  For dinner, we had the pulled pork sandwhich and ribs.   Both were just OK.  The ribs had good flavor, but were a bit dry.  I might come back for drinks, but probably not for food."}
{"text":"Location: Perfect old town vibe in my favorite older walking area. Great segway to either a night out on the town or a casual stroll.   Atmosphere: Lovely. Dark and classy, but not pretentious at all. Great bar area and back patio - good for groups.   Drinks: Extensive looking bar. I had a perfectly blended Moscow mule in a copper mug. Enough said.   Food: BBQ and delicious. Start with the bacon board appetizer and make sure to use all the relishes and jams - super flavorful and unique. For my entree I had the pulled pork which was to die for. Comes with a choice of side (skip the veggies and do Mac and cheese or mashed potatoes - awesomeness), tortillas, and coleslaw. Great portions so you'll need to be rolled out.   Service: Super friendly and lovely but a little slow and inattentive. Enjoy your meal and take it slow/European style and no problems will be had.   Love this place and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"A warm Welcome from bartender (John) was much appreciated by our family as we meandered toward the intoxicating, fragrant wafts of sweet smoke from the shady side of the street. 'Bootleggers' immediately became our choice for satiating our growling tummy's.  20 beers on tap! Sips of Apple Moonshine and a smoked brisket sandwich that was to die for. John, the bartender was astute at his brew options and made excellent suggestions. Enjoyed a little college football on the big screen snarfed some good grub. Now that's a nice Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Absolute best meal and beer I've had In my life. Food? 11/10 beer 10/10 people? Even better."}
{"text":"The Hubs and I were looking for a Happy Hour spot to meet my parents at and checked our handy dandy yelp app and decided on Bootleggers because of the reviews and it was near where we were.  Walking up to the joint, we could tell we were in for a treat (not because of the strip mall location), but because of the awesome BBQ smells permeating from the restaurant.  It was a bit dimly lit inside for 5PM, but we all sat down and looked forward to a great meal.  When we arrived we were the only people in there, but by the time we were ready to leave there was a line out the door... that surely says something about the food.  The table decided on sharing some things including the bacon board, nachos, and wings.  My Mom had the apple pie moonshine... dear lord... that was dessert and alcohol all at the same time, what could be better.  It was really good.  The bacon board was huge and everything on it was salty, sweet goodness.  We highly recommend that board of goodness.  The nachos were awesome, surprisingly awesome in fact, and the wings were crispy and cooked perfectly.  Basically all you could as for in wings.  Needless to say we had an excellent experience.  The waiter was super excited about the food and the restaurant (especially given it was his first day).  Without a doubt we will be back to give the non-happy hour menu a shot.  I am quite pleased with this new hidden gem (although by the looks of it, it's not hidden any more)!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal and service.  We are vacationers and Bootleggers is on our must visit list whenever we come to Scottsdale.  Great atmosphere and a creative menu! Simply we love this place...in particulate the Nacho Flat."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was a little disappointed. Not many good BBQ places in Scottsdale unfortunately. I ordered a coffee, but they don't carry sugar. Only sweet and low and stevia. Got the brisket nachos for app and they were good. Nice portions of brisket and guac. For dinner, I got the PBLT sandwich (new times award winner). The bread was soaked in butter, but the actual meat was good. Very rich sandy. My date got the kale salad. Drenched in dressing and had to send it back. Not that impressed. Service was excellent. Very attentive server and manager."}
{"text":"First walking into the restaurant it is a very nice place with a good ambience. We sat down looked at the cocktail menu for a bit and decided on some cocktails. I had the Catdaddy old fashioned. It's a pretty decent old fashioned a little different then what I'm used to drinking. But none the less a decent cocktail. We then ordered a bacon board for the table. Talk about amazing, surely was the highlight of the meal. The pork belly and the apple wood smoked bacon are amazing. And the con fiet pork belly just melts in your mouth. For my entree I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I always say you can really judge a BBQ place by there pulled pork. And when it came to the table it wasn't exactly what I was used to. I was just hoping for some pulled pork some slaw and a bun. It came slathered already in BBQ sauce. So I really couldn't taste the smoked flavor I was hoping to taste from what the menu says is a 14 hour smoked pork shoulder. I'm not saying it was a bad sandwich. I just prefer getting a pulled pork sandwich and adding BBQ sauce as I like or none at all if it's that good of a flavor in a meat. Which a pulled pork smoked for that long should already have enough amazing flavor it shouldn't need sauce. After the entree we ordered some cobbler. The cobbler is really good I recommend that as well. I'd probably return to the restaurant again. But not for the BBQ. I'd probably try some other appetizers and get that cobbler again. I just prefer more of a competition style BBQ where I can taste the flavor of the smoke in the meat."}
{"text":"Came in for a late night meal and the food was amazing! Everything on the menu sounded perfect and the bartender directed us towards the burgers. The were absolutely perfect and definitely hit the spot! Jameson (the bartender) has great knowledge about his cocktails and made an old fashioned very similar to the one I make, which is very rare to find. I will definitely be back! Thank you Jameson! You are an amazing bartender!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection - and happy hour is a good option - very tasty tacos.  We need to come back and try the barbecue platter for 2."}
{"text":"Where is the ZERO when I need one!  This was my first and last time I will eat there.  We went since my brother n law said it was a good place to eat and he wanted to go there.  Service was bad!  Never came back and refilled drinks nor did she separate the checks like my brother n law asked her to.  We had no silverware or napkins set for us until after the food came and WE had to ask for it!  When I received my food, I had no roll as stated on the menu but the roll was one of my less worries.  It was a hamburger bun cut in half!  lol!!  The quality of the food was not there for the money we paid, yes over priced!  My Prime Rib was smoked around the edges but had no flavor in the center.  The cole slaw had no flavor.  They were going to charge me $3 extra to order the Sweet Corn instead of Mashed Potatoes.  What a joke!!  I stayed with the Mashed Potatoes. My husband ordered the Brisket and he received a few pieces very thinly sliced and the BBQ sauce was terrible!  He agreed the Cole Slaw had no taste at all.  The only food item we ordered that we liked were  the Sliders for an appetizer.  Needless to say, with the amount of money we paid out last night, we will not be going back!  I've tasted much better Prime Rib up at Harold's in Cave Creek!  The only place I have ever gotten good flavored Prime Rib in the area!"}
{"text":"Our team of 20+ took over the private dining room a couple of weeks back while in town for a conference. I'd had the pleasure of meeting the proprietor of the restaurant previously at another conference in SanFrancisco, so when I made the connection that this was his spot I was thrilled.   The private dining area, is super cozy as the tables are surrounded by fire! Before you get concerned for my/safety, don't worry it was contained. To the read of the dining area was a massive rustic fireplace hearth and to one of the ends the restaurants massive industrial smoker - which sort of resembled a small restaurant itself. There was no chance any of us were leaving not smelling like beautiful smoked wood. I actually spent the next morning deeply inhaling the sweet scents off my clothes. Heaven!   We had a variety of shared appetizers for the table including a pork filled potsticker/dumpling, guacamole and some others. All the appetizers were fantastic and cooked perfectly. I only wish I wasn't watching what I was eating so I could eat even more!   For my main, and as I type this I realize that I might have just contradicted my previous rationale, I had the 12oz smoked prime rib which came with a. Lie cheese mash and veggies. The prime rib was enormous and I only managed to eat 2/3 before respectfully tapping out. It was a thing of beauty, smoked slow and low, seasoned to perfection. The majority of the meat was pink and juicy but there were a couple of spots that had been cooked a little more than I usually prefer. Still delicious but just not my personal preference.   Bootlegger, as the name suggests, also makes. Sir very own Moonshine in a variety of flavors! Sadly I'm also not drinking alcohol to start the year so I missed out on trying this.   Definitely want to come back when I can fully indulge in even more of their menu and maybe a cheeky glass (or two) of moonshine.   Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"Amazing food and tasty drinks!! The homemade apple pie moonshine is dangerously delicious!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Great moonshine! Great time! If you're looking for a date night place or just somewhere new to try I'd give this place a shot. I went during happy hour (3-6pm) and it was a great time with good pricing! I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I recently took my friend and her 7 year old son to Bootlegger's for dinner to celebrate her birthday. The atmosphere walking in was great and the lighting was really nice. It wasn't over-crowded or too loud.  I did notice it was pretty warm in there, though.   The hostess was polite, and asked us if we needed a kids menu to which we told her yes, but she never ended up giving us one. It was quickly rectified when our waiter came to greet us, though. He was knowledgeable of the food, and brought our drink orders quickly. I had the Trace 75- TO DIE FOR. Oh my goodness I could drink 10 of those, they are so delicious. I highly recommend trying it.  My friend is a rather picky eater, and only wanted a plain hamburger with cheese, and the kitchen accommodated her- even with the lack of toppings she said it was great. Her son had a burger off the kids menu and asked for mashed potatoes on the side (the kitchen melted cheese on top which he was very happy about). He wolfed down his plate in record time and also said it was really good.   I had the sliced beef brisket and it was wonderful. Cooked perfect, and the coleslaw was super good. I almost wanted to ask for another side of it! Plus, homemade tortillas- so soft and tasty.  We ordered a brownie with ice cream for dessert, and although a tiny bit dry, it was still good.   This was my first visit here, and I will definitely be back. I was glad that it was such a good experience, since I was bringing someone who is a picky eater, and I wasn't sure how she would like it. All around, a total success!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing from our starters (jalapeño hummus/nacho plate) to our shared sampler plate (w/smashed potatoes and potato salad). The manager stopped by our table and chatted with us for a bit which was a nice touch. Would love to have a place like this in SoCal to come to all the time! Oh yeah, and the Blue Moon cocktail with the blueberry moonshine on point!"}
{"text":"Prime Rib is really tender and perfectly cooked...cheese mashed potatoes fresh and flavorful...broccoli rabe steamed just right.  Apple Pie Moonshine is awesome.  Great ambiance and location.  Staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  Highly recommended! A restaurant you can come back to over and over again."}
{"text":"We finally got the chance to visit this restaurant, after putting it off too long. We sat at a high-top table in bar section, where there are several TV's turned to sports. Our waiter asked if this was our first visit, and, when he learned, he highlighted their menu and cocktails. We ordered the Brisket dinner, with flour tortillas and excellent cole slaw. The brisket was done perfectly. Nice and lean with just the right amount of smokey flavor. Smoked meats can sometimes be over powering, but, theirs is done just right. It could have used additional BBQ sauce, perhaps, on the side would have been nice. We also ordered the smoked turkey melt, open face sandwich. Again, the turkey was smoked perfectly. Bacon, melted cheese, tomatoes made it excellent. We ordered the Yukon gold fried potatoes for an additional $2.00, which were again excellent. We added the side green beans, which we had heard were good. They are sautéed, and extremely flavorful. Just a side note that they use cloth napkins, which is a really nice surprise. They offer a full bar, with an extensive beer selection. The staff is very friendly and inviting and, well trained. We would certainly return, especially to try other specials on their large menu. Chef Fox has a good thing going here..."}
{"text":"Went here the other afternoon with a friend... fantastic service and the wings were perfect!  I'm sure we will be returning several times over."}
{"text":"It comes with a heavy heart that I have to rate only 2 stars.  I've tried this place twice now and both times the service was horrendous!  I don't really understand why either.  The place isn't that busy and there are quite a few servers walking around.  Both times we waited over 10 minutes and had to flag someone down just to get started with water or even have someone say hello to us. (I want to add that we came after the dinner rush on both occasions.  There were open tables around us.) I feel that is a little excessive of a wait time for a greeting.  Anyway, even after being greeted and drink orders placed, both times we found ourselves lurking around the restaurant in search of help once we were ready to move through the steps of the meal process.  (i.e. order food, refill of water, order another drink, etc.)  The food here is really good and I really was hoping that last time we were here that the bad service was a fluke.  Unfortunately no.  With there being so many restaurants to choose from nowadays.  I don't foresee myself trying this place a third time.  The lack of attentive service has steered me to trying out other places instead.  Not to mention that the food was better on our first visit.  Hope this isn't a trend as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!  The Bacon Board is a MUST and don't sleep on the side of onion and pepper jams if comes with.  My fiancee and I are having our wedding rehearsal dinner at Bootleggers and we got a chance to sample a fair amount of the menu and we loved everything. The pork belly, brisket and turkey stood out to me but everything was delicious.  Great atmosphere, exactly what you're looking for in a BBQ restaurant. There's a large bar area plus indoor and outdoor seating. The drinks are creative and easy to forget there's alcohol at times. The even have an apple pie moonshine that I sipped on it's own and it was the most delicious alcohol I've ever had in my life. Sweet apple with a touch of cinnamon and it even tastes like there's a bit of a pie crust in there as well!  Can't recommend this place enough, especially for a big group! Order a bunch of stuff and share it all"}
{"text":"Not TOO bad. Here for a conference and this place showed up in my Yelp recommendations. The service was pretty slow and the appetizer came out at the same time as the entree. The guac was pretty good, but the meat was just ok."}
{"text":"Holy Cow.  This place is incredible.    My fiance and I came here last night on a double date with another Yelp Elite and her husband.  All of us loved it.  Our drinks were delicious.  The Manager even came by with samples of their Apple Pie Moonshine, which is very tasty.  The food was crazy good.  We had a bacon board as an appetizer.  That was like a dream come true.  We all had BBQ for dinner, and all of it was amazing.  I'm excited to return soon to try their Happy Hour.  YUM."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with the folks. We should have ordered from the happy hour menu that looked good at other tables. The food we ordered from the menu was cold and uneventful. The server was a little over the top but friendly."}
{"text":"The Decor was modern, just as their name suggest, with the orange chairs and stainless steel tables.   The food was delicious, mac and cheese was to die for. The beef brisket was also very tender and juicy with fat lining it. The homemade potato chips were good too! All so good.  The service was great. The waiter ,Torrance, recommended the grilled traditional (buffalo wings). Was pleased with the recommendation, and they tasted good too. Overall very wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"nice remodel.....food not that great.....we had ribs, chicken and pork chops tonight....chicken undercooked...taken off bill.....mac and cheese side good"}
{"text":"Just had lunch and it was an awesome experience! I ordered the chicken sandwich with fries, my fiancé had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. Both were AWESOME, but I think the pulled pork sandwich was the winner! And the sweet potato fries are dipped in this amazing maple sauce! The afternoon vibe was cool, all the games on, but muted so you could talk and fun music on. Larry was our server, he was so great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Average food and the management / ownership is off their rocker. My wife wanted the chicken but they said they could only sell it to go for $12. Really? Convinced them to serve it in house and was charged $24. Same chicken dish! Disappointing. Do they not know that restaurants are in the service industry? Just not a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Old Town Scottsdale is full of restaurants and bars, but some are hidden from the main thoroughfare (Scottsdale Boulevard). We stumbled upon Bootleggers while in search of a Happy Hour place. The beer selection was good, the food choices were decent (gravitated towards fusion). But what hooked us was the server (Chris?) and the ambiance."}
{"text":"My fiance and I loved the Downtown Scottsdale Bootleggers, so we had to try this location.  The service here was fantastic.  At both locations everyone was incredibly kind and helpful.  The food was excellent.  We tried the Shrimp and Grits, which was delicious, as was the PBLT and Bootlegger Burger.  The drinks are great, too.  This is now my go-to restaurant for BBQ.   If you haven't been yet, give your diet a day off and get in here!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Stumbled across this restaurant while walking in Scottsdale and it was awesome. Very nice atmosphere, great food and the service was amazing. The waiter was hilarious and brought smiles to us all! We recomend it to anyone who is planning to visit Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"We recently tried this newer restaurant in NE Phoenix. It primarily serves BBQ, but the atmosphere (and prices) is rather different than most pork and rib \"joints.\"  Our visit may not have been typical: if you like beer, stick with what is on draft; the wine is very expensive for this type of establishment.   The entrees are a la carte and rather expensive for what you get - a slab of meat on a plate.  The only exception is the burger which was very good and came with chips.   No bread was offered.  It took quite a while for our entrees to arrive yet there were few occupied tables. My husband's steak was good, but my son's brisket was dry.  Our server was friendly and courteous but needs to improve her knowledge of the bar offerings (different types of beer, etc.).   They should lose the 1965 Bob Dylan music.  Although we were so pleased to see a non-chain restaurant open in our neighborhood, we don't plan on returning.  The overall experience did not justify the prices."}
{"text":"If I had to grade, it would be an incomplete.  We stopped in for lunch, waited 10 minutes and not one employee came into view.  Not a bartender, waitress or hostess.  So we left and went to another restaurant. Which I will review when we're done with lunch!"}
{"text":"The staff was great and very attentive.  The food was amazing. I had the brisket tacos and my husband went the Prime Rib.  We had the pot stickers and mussels for the appetizers and everything was on point.  I can't wait to go back and try a different dish."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! We had a large group, very accommodating and the staff was great. Murphy was a blast and helpful with the menu so many good choices. I had the pulled pork and side Mac and cheese....best Mac and cheese ever, pulled pork was good as well.  Drinking was very large a lot to choose from. Highly recommend if you are local or visiting and it is close to everything."}
{"text":"This review is a little delayed but still had to be written. As my last meal in my AZ chapter I chose to take my dad here and it was a perfect choice. Having taken friends here previously and not reviewed, I had to this time to make sure Arizonans know to get over there and support them.  The best BBQ in AZ hands down! I spent 12 years trying to find it and in my last few days in the state, my search was complete. Great smoke, excellent quality meat, good sauce flavor.  The \"bacon sampler\" sounds and looks amazing, next trip there I will try but overhearing other diners comments, it does not disappoint. The grilled corn is amazing and gets inhaled immediately. The \"bootlegger\" burger is huge and juicy. Mac and cheese is spot on and you have to try the kale, it's amazing. I've done the brisket and the shredded turkey and both are awesome! Great beers on tap (always get a plus when they have my hometown Lagunitas IPA) and great tasting 'shine! Everyone who walks around Old Town should stop here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great set up, amazing menu, very friendly staff & so chill. Lots of space & they have a private event room! Check out Paint Night or book a party it's perfect!"}
{"text":"My friend's and I arrived here for an evening drink before the late night party scene - really chill atmosphere! It's hidden in the corner, off Shea/51, a little gem. Bootleggers has that Old West saloon style vibe, low lighting, I dig it. I was craving an old fashioned. Go for the Catdaddy - super smooth! I was intrigued by the walnut bitters & moonshine mix. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My brother took me here for the first and last time.!Sat down, received drinks in a timely fashion, ordered apps when drinks were dropped off, apps arrived 40min later as the server explained 'the kitchen didn't know the apps were on the menu.'   We didn't stay the extra hour on our lunch to find out how the entrees were. I will say the pork belly tasted ok, and deviled eggs were crap. I will also add the price point of this place is way off, so spend your money for quality deliciousness elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm stunned... What an absolutely terrible experience.  We're visitors coming right from the Giants Spring Training game. Good and hungry but really wanted a salad..a hearty salad. We both ordered the Beet Salad ($11), him with brisket, me with chicken (now $17-no problem).  Our salads were TINY..and no bread or roll or anything on the side.  We told the Manager the taste was good, but for $17 each we were expecting a good, hearty sized salad and maybe some bread.  What a jerk this guy was..can't even describe what a douche. Our waitress ended up bringing us a couple of pieces of wood-fired bread after we were already done eating that tasted like I held a piece of bread over my campfire.  Terrible experience.  Most of their meals looked hearty, why not make a hearty salad for health conscience people with a big appetite?  Yuck...with all of the options in Scottsdale, what a disappointment that we chose this place."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Bootleggers while in a recent vacation. Went in to have drinks, highly recommended......Christopher is a great bartender!!!!!! Ended up having dinner, the Prime Rib is amazing!!!!! If you are in Old Town and looking to grab a bite to eat you can't go wrong by choosing Bootleggers"}
{"text":"Unassuming, strip mall location...but really yummy BBQ with super-friendly service. We weren't thrilled with the steak taco (a little gristle), but the pork belly taco and brisket platter were delish and the Jack Daniels brownie is a must. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times this year. Once just for a drink and once for lunch. It's a nice atmosphere no matter what and a good location in old town. My friend ordered the deviled eggs which I didn't think sounded appetizing, but to my surprise was quite good. My food was good as well. There's a ton of places to choose from so you should put this one on your list."}
{"text":"Great staff, great service, great ambiance - all topped only by the cocktail menu and food. Seriously - I'm so glad this isn't in Chicago, because I'd be here every day. Came in for a long weekend, stopped on a recommendation from a friend. Was impressed to find the GM, Jeremy, working the bar, and assistant Josh working the kitchen. Drinks? Apple pie moonshine. Our server had just made a fresh batch, absurdly good. Tasted the others, but none compared. Food? Bacon board - just do it.  And prepare to be filled. Wanted to try so much more. Seriously couldn't. Just cool folks, great atmosphere. Loved it."}
{"text":"So I went out for a quick drink with some friends last night and pulled into Bootleggers. I honestly thought it was going to be some little drive bar judging from the small plaza it is located in. In fact, it even looked closed! But once inside I was very impressed. Mason jar chandelier and drink glasses. Perfect atmosphere for a smoke house. There's a window that allows you to see some of the kitchen and the wood piles used for smoking. The place smelt great but my friends and I were only there for a quick drink. That's when the bartender informed us about their signature apple pie moonshine made in house. It was pretty tasty, I gotta tell ya. But I can't wait to try a meal. Service was great. The bartender, I think his name is Mike, was great! Definitely a good experience. I'll be back to write a review about the BBQ here soon!"}
{"text":"Decent bbq. Mac and cheese was not that good. The tortillas and cole slaw were good though. I had brisket and pulled pork. I would say they are cooked relatively well. Both brag 10+ hours of smoking"}
{"text":"Ok, so I wanted to take wife out for great meal near where we live.....not possible. (Sorry W. Bell rd.) So, we traveled to the other side of town (NE Phx) to a little place called \"Bootleggers Smokehouse\" nestled in the corner of some other shops. Simply put, Food: Amazing (I ordered almost everything) Drinks: Well made (thx Robin) good beer sel.  Service: five stars.  Great job Bootleggers, you made a germ-a-phobic food snobs day!"}
{"text":"This was a modern take on classic BBQ. The wait staff was wonderful and the food was amazing. I will definitely be returning to try more."}
{"text":"Great BBQ in old town. We sat at the bar and the bartender John was so great and attentive. He recommended good food options and was knowledgeable about the menu. They have tv's in the bar area playing football games. My friend and I split the pulled pork with an egg added on top, it was delicious! They have homemade moonshine here. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here and it was just as good as the first. The service is great and the food is wonderful. It's tucked in the corner off of Shea and the 51 and I would have never found it if it wasn't for Yelp. If you like bar BBQ you have to try this place out. Killer drinks too!"}
{"text":"I always go to the Bootleggers on Shea and the brisket is my families favorite and is consistently awesome! We have had it many times and have only been disappointed one time when the kitchen had run out and we had to order something else.  Tonight i decided to take a group to the old town location, never been there before and can tell you will never go back.  The chef definitely needs to train at the Shea location - today sauce was on everything, even the brisket - very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best. I had the burger which was fantastic. Other family members had the pork belly tacos and the brisket which were absolutely  delicious. Leon one of the servers was so attentive, friendly, and loved the attention he gave my grandma that just made her day.  I wish there was more people like him. Obviously the moonshine was off the charts and made in house, which is so cool and tasty.  I'd be back for sure and recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended by our Air BnB hosts. What amazing service and the food was phenomenal. I highly recommend the Nachos that have lovely bits of brisket hash. So tender and delicious. We will be back again for more!"}
{"text":"What a great find. Wanted a new destination to kick off the evening with the (adult) family - saw the great reviews for this and it was located in a great area to hang after dinner too.   The pitmaster has the skills - our group had pork chile tacos, a giant sampler for two, brisket, and pulled pork. Every meat was tender and moist - even the turkey (that is some kind of voodoo in itself imo)   The drinks were tasty, (blue moon something, gin/tonics, craft beer, etc). That's the only critique I think I can offer - a more updated beer list. Sounds like they like to add new beers often, so our waiter had to pull from memory or go ask the bar what was available.   We were offered a nice sample of a cinnamon spiced moonshine - wow, crazy smooth and really really good - would have had indulged in a refill if I weren't the DD!   We really enjoyed our visit - the bar was hopping and the restaurant side was quiet enough to converse across the table.   Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is spectacular. The food is great and the staff is both professional and welcoming. You can relax on your lunch break  or come back at night with that hot date. If you come at night be sure to ask for Lauren because she is awesome! She remembers my order every time! Also if you didn't already know this they are a great destination for large groups. This past weekend I brought in two groups of over 20 people and it was a fantastic experience! Long story short...Bootleggers comes highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Bootleggers to grab a beer and appetizers. Since I love bacon I went with the Bacon Board and also ordered Nacho Flat. They both were delicious. The bacon board had variety of different types of bacon, from house smoked pork belly to dry cured apple bacon. The nachos had chopped bacon and a chipotle cheddar sauce. Some of the best nacho's I've ever had. I washed everything down with a nice cold beer and a shot of moonshine. I will definitely be back to try an entrée."}
{"text":"I'm from Kansas City so when it comes to barbecue I have very high expectations! Needless to say this restaurant did not disappoint! I ordered the sampler so I could try everything and have been making lunch with the meats all week!! Great portion size for the money, also had the prime rib and that was amazingly delicious and tender too! If you're looking for barbecue in the north Phoenix area, check this place out!"}
{"text":"We were scrambling to find a place for dinner last week, after searching on Yelp, stumbled upon Bootleggers. The menu looked fantastic so we decided to give it a try. We were one of a few couples dining there mid-week, and had the most amazing experience. The food was INCREDIBLE (think, smoked brisket sandwiches, pulled pork, BBQ meats etc.)   They were great with my necessity to eat gluten-free, and really accommodated nicely. We were so pleasantly surprised by the food, that we talked about going back immediately after we left. The service was great too - one of the managers brought us over a few samples of beer (for free!). Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"We went for our first time and sat in the bar with Tim. We came during happy hour and ordered the deviled eggs/ wings.  The honey Sriracha sauce on the wings are bomb! We then got the BBQ sampler since it was our first time w a side of coleslaw and mac n cheese. Everything was so good!!! The meat is lean with lots of flavor. My favorites were the brisket and the ribs. The ambiance is super nice as well. Tim gave the best service and was very friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am a fan, yes, but man, they are pricey for the little food you get. Then again, smokehouses aren't cheap to run, the facility infrastructure maintenance costs suck so I can sympathize with the owners.  I ordered the dumplings which were only three on a plate for 9 bucks... Kinda shocked. So each dumpling is worth 3 dollars? Seriously? I make dumplings at home for what calculates to 31 cents each!  But ok, the food was good, sure. Got the brisket for lunch and it was well flavored and the coleslaw was alright. Nothing to die for though.  Might I return? I mean, maybe?"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary, Moonshine, and Bacon Board!! What more can you ask for? This place is great. Great service, great drinks, and yummy food.  The ambiance is great too. If you are a meat lover this place is for you. The BBQ is great too."}
{"text":"Bootleggers is great!  You can smell the smoking meat from the street.  They have excellent options for seating.  The bar is upbeat and modern, the dining room is comfortable and the patio is amazing!  The patio is located right by where the meat is cooked/smoked.  Smells AMAZING!  When I was there I had the pork belly sliders and apple pie moonshine.  Can't wait to go back and try more of their food!  The staff could not have been friendlier and you can't beat the location!"}
{"text":"As soon as we parked in the unassuming strip mall and got out of the truck, I knew by the smell of the air we were in for a treat. The onsite smoker for this barbecue joint had the air full of mouth watering flavors.   When we walked inside I was a little in shock. I expected a typical 'strip mall restaurant' but was surprised to find a restaurant that could easily be found in Scottsdale Quarters. The dining room tables, all stainless steel with steel 'patio style chairs,' were warmed up with dark tufted leather high back booths and linen wrapped silverware. The lighting was perfect and accentuated the reclaimed wood and high shelves covered in prohibition period art and decor.   I was excited to see a one page menu. Food on one side and drinks on the other. We were greeted quickly by Stacey, a server that clearly enjoyed her job and had a strong knowledge of the menu.   I started off with the Catdaddy Old Fashioned (made with moonshine instead of bourbon) which was light but full of flavor. Typically an old fashioned feels a little thicker or heavier in the mouth but this was light. My boyfriend said it felt like drinking Dr Pepper (that's not a criticism for him).   For an appetizer we had the Kitchen Sink Guacamole. It is a chunkier guac that has pieces of Avacado and nopales. I was most excited to see they provided enough chips to actually finish the appetizer. Nothing's worse than being left with a dish of guacamole and nothing to eat it with.   For dinner we took our server's suggestion and ordered the BBQ Sampler for Two which came with 5 meets and coleslaw. The coleslaw was fantastic. Perfectly and lightly dressed bite sized pieces of crisp cabbage and vegetables.  Ribs:  two ribs came with the plate and they were my favorite. The meat fell easily off the bone with each bite. Brisket:  about six slices came with the platter. The perfect amount to share. It was juicy and tender with great flavor on its own.  Hot links:  two links with the plate and the experience was a surprise. I typically don't order hot links at a bbq joint so I'm glad I got the sampler. The crisp bite and slight heat notes at the end made this a great surprise.  Pulled Pork:  this was served sauce less but was amazingly moist with slightly crisp ends. The flavor was spot on and the plate came with a generous portion of about 1 cup.  Turkey: a great way to finish off the plate. It came with four thin but meaty slices. The meat was smoked pink and very tender.  Served with the platter were three sauces: traditional, spicy and Dr Pepper. They were all great but we were both partial to the Dr Pepper sauce. It also came with fresh (what seemed to be hand made) tortillas. We suggest trying all the meats as they arrive and then getting creative and making tacos with the different meats, sauces and coleslaw. Every bite is a different and a new experience.   For sides we ordered the Smokes Sweet Corn with Chulula Lime Butter and the Mac & Cheese. The corn was crisp and flavorful, although I couldn't taste the lime. The chulula was great on the corn. The Mac & Cheese was gooey and cheesy and house made. It's a must.    Overall the experience was great. The service was good. My only complaints were, 1. My water glass sat empty for quite a while. And 2.  It would have been nice to have a warm wet linen or even a wet-nap to wash off my sticky hands from the ribs.   We look forward to sitting at the trendy but unsuspecting bar on our next visit."}
{"text":"This was a great first stop in our visit to Phoenix.  We were looking for something local.  The atmosphere was rustic.  The food was so flavorful and amazing, everything we had was delicious.  I love guacamole with pomegranate, the fries were tasty and we shared the dinner for two.  The variety of meat was great and it all tasted so good without the sauce although the jalapeño was my favorite.  The service was friendly and great.  The server forgot to put in our dinner order but was very upfront and communicated well.  Got us taken care of and all was good.  The food was worth the wait.  Definite must stop!!"}
{"text":"Had only been to the Shea location for a few work happy hours... food has always been good at those, but today ordered for myself and had the salmon blt. Was amazing... friend had the smoked prime rib and said was good. Plenty of food for sure. Will be back"}
{"text":"Bootleggers take the word \"Smokehouse\" to another level.  Not only does their barbecue meet the high standards of BBQ connoisseurs across the country but they are culinary gansters who have found their niche in this foodie paradise that is Old Town Scottsdale.  They are extremely creative with their appetizers fusing american barbecue with palate pleasing asian and latin inspired flavors.  If you just prefer good ol' down home BBQ that feeds your soul, well Bootleggers is serving up those traditional dishes every day!"}
{"text":"Bootleggers is a top notch smokehouse. I had the smoked prime rib and it was delicious.  My wife had the salmon BLT which was also fantastic. My only complaint is the rub they put on the corn on the cob was really hot on the Scoville scale. I would definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"All I can say--don't bother--I had the turkey and it tasted just like I had opened a deli pack--slimy and way, way, too salty--absolutely no flavor--coleslaw was also unremarkable--none of my dining companions commented on the food--presentations were unremarkable--brisket that friend ordered looked very dry-service was fine.  spend your dining dollar elsewhere.  PS-if you are expecting anything vaguely resembling something that would come out of a bbq  joint-you will be sadly disappointed.  they should not be allowed to use smokehouse in their name."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through the TV show diners dives and drive-ins. So I went to check it out. I had the brisket and pulled pork combo. The brisket was good and the pulled pork was fine. It's just that the portions were so small, and for 15 bucks I don't think I got enough food. Add an order of fries and a pint of Stella and it was 26 bucks. Kind of pricey for the amount of food I got"}
{"text":"Travel a lot and love to try out BBQ in the various cities, comparing to home town Texas BBQ.     Was impressed with the extensive menu here (way beyond BBQ), but we were focused on trying the BBQ, so got the BBQ Sampler for four and a bunch of extra sides. Brisket, hot link, turkey, pulled pork, and ribs.  4pm Saturday afternoon - to go (had two fussy grandkids at home).            The pulled pork was really good, moist, fresh.    The ribs were tender and moist and those were good too, not sure how fresh off the smoker though.    The turkey was fine, not amazing, but wouldn't get again.    The brisket and the sausage were dried out, tough, and pretty much inedible.    The brisket - cardinal sin with brisket - looked previously sliced and then perhaps tossed on a burner / grill to re-heat.    Ugh.  Sausage/hot links the same.  \"no no no no\".  The mac'n'cheese was good.   The guacamole was good.   I really liked the cole slaw.      All in all, we would come back to try more of the standard menu, there were some interesting things to try...   but the BBQ?    nah...  not enough control over what's being served."}
{"text":"Won't be back it was a nice try but bacon board was not worth the money the BLT SANDWICH was ok but not great pork pot stickers were ok but not memorable service excellent..."}
{"text":"Average service, food is okay. I'd come but for the beers at bar only. The decour is relaxed and charming."}
{"text":"Someone hand me some bandaids, I almost bit my fingers off. Where to begin, great ribs, the best prime rib ever, and I'm not entirely sure what treasures they put in the mash potatoes but I'll be dreaming of them tonight. Great service from Dana, and I really appreciate you introducing us to the apple pie moonshine. I will definitely be back.  Thanks Dana!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. It was a random night searching yelp in the area for food. Found this place with good reviews and thought to give it a try. Neat country steal décor serve beer in mason jars. (nice change)  I had the Bootleggers Burger   1/2 lb seared patty, house sauce, muenster cheese, whiskey onions, crimini mushroom, slab bacon, on a pretzel bun Yeah it sounds good and tastes great I love the pretzel bun well seasoned and messy a must try"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! The ambience is fantastic, beautiful lighting, candles on every table. Reasonably priced food and drinks."}
{"text":"The food here is better than average bbq. The service can be very good to terrible even within the same visit. For example this has happened to me a few times, you'll be having a great dinner everything is great and the staff will suddenly completely ignore you, It is bazaar!"}
{"text":"Been awhile since we have dined here and for the most part, everything was the same. The macaroni and cheese is still the best around. The problem lies with the $13 Brisket tacos. These tacos use brisket hash, which is not chopped up regular brisket, but mostly the fatty pieces of brisket that aren't used in other dishes. The tacos were tiny and with the fatty meat inside just made for a bad overall choice. The smoke turkey was still good in the open faced sandwich and the sweet potato fries were mostly hot and crispy. Stick to the entrees and things will be fine here next time."}
{"text":"There are two locations. This one and one in old town Scottsdale. I have only been here. I love the decor...distressed wood walls, copper topped high top bar tables, mason jar light fixtures, etc....  The food is amazing, but you need to like bbq/smoked foods. I am a fan and I have never had better. I just had the ribs which were perfect sided with smashed potatoes. My wife had the wood plank salmon over mashed cauliflower. We both demolished or dinners. They serve a full bar including housemate moonshine in an array of flavors. They do have vegetarian choices, so they cater to all."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer selection, but for some reason I wasn't wow'd. The service was friendly and courteous, but slow. The food was very tasty, but the portions were underwhelming."}
{"text":"Went there on a whim with some friends and we were pleasantly surprised. My suggestion - order the bacon board and cheese fries as an appetizer. You won't be disappointed. The wait staff was friendly, the food was amazing, and the prices were decent. Definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"Fries to die for and sliced brisket that melts in your mouth.  Yum.  Friendly service and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious! The burgers are massive and have a daggum knife right through 'em. The moonshine is great and service was good. A bit pricey but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"BBQ brisket nachos!? Moonshine flights? Yep just a few amazing things at Bootleggers. We LOVE this place the food is sooooo good. Fun to sit outside w/covered patio. The BBQ tacos and Mac n cheese were also delicious.... Need to try happy hour next."}
{"text":"We had high expectations when coming here from all the good reviews. However, we were very disappointed. The decor is cute when you first come inside. The happy hour menu was small and consists of tacos? and two other snacks... The food was small, mediocre, and pricey.  Each silver dollar sized taco was around $3-4.. and it was not even good. Wouldn't they want to showcase more bbq items on their happy hour menu...? We will not be coming back.. Thanks but no thanks.."}
{"text":"Came here for our 1 year anniversary, was incredibly happy with everything, from food to service.  We started off with the Bacon Board, they were all so well done and the slices of Pork Belly were incredible.  My husband got the PBLT based on the reviews from here and he loved it.  I got the chopped brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and it was incredible.  The potato chips made on site were a nice complement to everything we ate.  I've been to similar places in Atlanta and this was very much so on par with it.  Everything we tried we went WOW and were very impressed with.    The atmosphere was great, a little hipsterish but nice.  The waitress was very attentive and answered all of our questions.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is because they didn't have anything on draft my husband hadn't already had.  There was  no real selection of local craft beer which was a bummer especially for a bar.  But other then that when it came to the food it was amazing, try it out especially if you are a fan of bacon."}
{"text":"Great service! Our waiter was fun, informative, and attentive. The nachos and moonshine were delicious. Cutely decorated."}
{"text":"First this location was a dirty dingy Dirty Drummer.   It was a dump, but they had good food.     Then, it became a 51 Grille (Café? Don't remember.  Whatever).  It was  a dump and the food was awful.    My hairdresser asked me if I had been to the new restaurant where Dirty Drummer used to be and I told her I had gone and hated it, but then she said it had changed hands again.  I like my hairdresser, so I took her word for it....  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.   They made that dirty dank dark divvy hole in the wall into a chic trendy restaurant.    I love the décor, it's modern and upscale, but yet with an old feel to it.    The food is amazing!     I love the Panko style chicken sandwich with a side of asparagus.   That sandwich is to die for!!   You really can't go wrong.    Every one of my friends who have gone with me have ordered meals that were also A+, especially anything that has been smoked.     The Apple Pie Moonshine will definitely lift your spirits after a hard day and the desserts are amazing, too.     The service can be a wee bit better, but I don't hate it.    I've gone back a few dozen times and it's absolutely on my list of favorite places to go in the PV area."}
{"text":"Our experience at Bootleggers was amazing! Great service; friendly, outstanding food; so delicious."}
{"text":"Did a group painting session here. It was really cool to have a private painting session with just our group.   The beer was good, also had the green chile tacos. They were okay, nothing special. However not sure if it was the beer or the tacos that gave me an upset stomach. Even had to vomit."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. Bar beverages are out of this world. We routinely take friends here who are visiting from out of town and they always ask to go back. Also, I've had a work dinner here (party of 15) and it went swimmingly.  Lots of options for various diets. Gluten free,vegetarian, vegan, paleo, etc. they've got it covered."}
{"text":"Major disappointment. Went on a Wednesday evening for drinks and dinner. Service was terrible. We waited 30 minutes for drinks. The bartender was way too slow and could not keep up with a half empty restaurant. Many other guests were frustrated with the lack of attention by the server and bartender. The staff was friendly but way too slow. Food was overpriced for what it is. Nacho plate was oily. The chipotle cheese sauce tasted like it was from a can. The BBQ meat was tasty but hard to find in any reasonable quantity. They left me with no reason to return and we won't."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in the Valley... Get here as soon as you can before everyone else finds out about this joint.  Let's start with the atmosphere:  I couldn't believe my eyes when I walked in... the last time I was at this location it was called the Dirty Drummer and that is exactly how I felt when I was in there, \"Dirty\"!  Now it is totally western chic'... Think what the wild west must of looked like 100 years ago, then add some really cool touches as if Christopher Lowell got his hands on the joint.  You know where I am going?  Trust me, the place looks amazing, just don't be intimidated by the outside.  Now to the service and food:  Like I said, this is my new favorite place for a couple reasons, the amazing service my wife and I received and...  wait for it...  the Bacon Board.  You heard me right...  the Bacon Board is totally unique and amazing, they really put their back into this effort and everyone should give it a go at least once.  I love how it flies in the face of other \"uppity\" joints with their $50 charcuterie boards.  Trust me, you are gonna love it, just be sure to double up on your Lipitor before you go.  The rest of the menu items are really well thought out and unique.  My wife had the Salmon over Kale and it was prepared perfectly and she loved it.  Finally, if for no other reason at all... Go for the Moonshine.  Seriously, how many other places have you EVER been that serve good ol\" American made White Lightning?  It is gonna blow your socks off, first for the amazing smooth taste and flavor and then for the buzz you are about to have.  Again, just trust me, try the flight of 3 and let the bartender pick out the flavors, you will be hooked just like Betty Ford was.  Enjoy, I know you will!"}
{"text":"I went to Bootlegger's on Monday for the soft opening.  Love the vibe!  Staff is very friendly especially Alyssa the bartender.  She knows what she is doing by keeping the conversation with customers and prompt service.  Fuller menu will be on Friday.  It is close to our house which we live at Shea/Tatum.  Glad something better is opening in the area.  Chef James Fox is an outstanding chef coming from the Mission and won grand awards both days at the AZ Taco Festival.    Looking forward to more late night options in the neighborhood.  You guys got this!  Congratulations and welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We went to Bootleggers for the first time on Saturday night.  Overall pretty good, I had some mixed reviews.  Pros: - Super friendly staff.  I had to change my reservation a couple of times because my husband was running late.  They were very friendly and accommodating.  They said as long as we arrived by 10pm we shouldn't have any problem.  - Cocktails were awesome! $11 each so they better have been!  - Bacon board was incredible!   Cons: - I got the ahi tuna sliders.  Pretty good, kind of lacking in flavor.  - Husband got the short rib.  It said on the menu that it came with sweet potato fritters, but seemed to both of us more like mashed sweet potatoes.  - They started clearing our table before 10pm.  We were finishing our very pricey cocktails and they took our candle and our flower away.  Totally rude in my opinion.  You can't just wait until we stand up and leave to grab the flower and candle!?  Biggest pet peeve is trying to enjoy dinner and you're not-so-subtly getting kicked out.  We weren't even the last ones in there.  Ruined the remainder of our experience.  Good thing we didn't order dessert, I have a feeling they would have just boxed it up for us."}
{"text":"I think that Bootleggers has a lot of potential, and probably rates better than this more often than not.  Unfortunately, we had a few issues on our visit that kept me from giving a higher rating.   When we arrived, the restaurant was moderately busy, but there were a number of open tables.  Of course, we were led to the tiniest table that was placed so close between two others that I felt like we should offer to share food with our neighbors.  We asked to sit at an open booth, and were told no; they \"thought it might be reserved\".  We ended up deciding to sit at the bar, and no one used the booth the entire time.    I was very excited about trying the bacon board, and it was darn tasty.  I absolutely loved the onion and tomato jams, and the lightly-cheesed toast was the perfect addition to the meats.  It was curious that the board was given to us without any explanation though.  I would have expected to have been told about the 5 different types of bacon and accompaniments.  We asked for some guidance so we knew what we were eating, but the server wasn't even sure the difference between a couple of them.  Still, it was tasty.  We also shared the BBQ Turkey breast.  I love that it came with homemade tortillas; it made delicious little tacos with the coleslaw on top.  We finished our meal by sharing the peach/blueberry cobbler.  Yum!   Other than the seating issues, my main complaint was the chatter among the wait/host staff.  Since we were sitting at the bar, close to the kitchen entrance and hostess station, we were privy to a number of personal conversations that shouldn't have been taking place, including complaints about a customer across the room.  Yikes!  I will return for the food and to try their many amazing looking drinks... but next time I'll insist on that booth and stay far from the chatter of the hostess station!"}
{"text":"Food was great however the bartender chris was super helpful awesome customer service and has some serious mixology skills, and atmosphere inside was perfect for the place"}
{"text":"First time here & the food is awesome! Drinks too! They should call their moonshine drinks giggle juice! Seriously, the brisket was unbelievably tender & delicious & the wings had a great sauce. Thoroughly enjoyed the lunch. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We ate here the other day and really enjoyed it.  The bar staff were friendly and welcoming.  The food was pretty good, We had the prime Rib and the roasted Chicken.  Both were pretty good but nothing out of this world that would give it a 5th star.  They should take it a little easier on the salt.  I like salty food, but my steak came to the table over salted. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Poor service! My grilled chicken was over cooked and the beef brisket was so so! Definitely disappointed in this place after all I had heard about it, but I did notice we werent the only ones receiving poor & slow service."}
{"text":"Good service even though it was busy, just like some of the reviews when you pull in the parking lot you can smell the smokers cooking and it is very inviting.  Very nice atmosphere lit well with candles on the tables & some TV's Food was top notch, good place to take a date , well thought out menu , just all around great food ."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Ordered deviled eggs to start (mistake, super weird tangy flavor and its $6 for three halves - that's $2 per half an egg...huh?)  I had a Cobb salad which was ok and very small - plenty of toppings but flavorless ranch dressing. Others at the table had the same sentiment...meh - only winner was the brisket.   All in all, it's just way too overpriced - expensive food raises expectations and these items were just consistently not worth it."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I have found a great new place to eat! The apple pie moonshine blew my mind! so yummy (had 4 of them). Food was great! short rib tacos were just amazing, so were the wings and everything else we had. Def coming back.....soon!"}
{"text":"Hidden in the corner of a small strip center, this smokehouse promised to be one of the best in phoenix.  I had the chicken wings, salad and the devil eggs. For $6 the eggs (3) were a disappointment. They had way too much mustard and a surprising smoky taste I didn't care for. The chicken wings I asked for plain with a sample of their sauces.  The regular bbq sauce was good. The buffalo sauce was average. The other 4 sauces got hotter than the buffalo sauce. Stick to the regular."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening after hearing good things. It's located in a old strip mall. From outside doesn't look like much but don't judge a book by its cover. The inside is very inviting with large tvs, and a dark modern decor.  Luckily we had called ahead and made a reservation because there was a 20min wait when we got there. The total seating is on the small side so I'd recommend calling ahead.  They're still working out the kinks and getting up to speed because the service was a little erratic. From wrong drinks and food items being brought out, it took a while to get everything sorted.  To start we ordered the nachos flat with avocado and pork. It was awesome, would def recommend. We also tried the Mac and cheese with fusilli pasta. Also recommended!  For entree, I had the PBLT, pork belly lettuce tomato sandwich. It came with just house made chips, I would've liked an option of fries instead. The pork belly was well cooked and moist but tasted very salty. I'm not sure if I was being sensitive but I could only finish half the sandwich.  Overall a good meal for the nachos and macncheese. Wish there was a happy hour to try as well."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Great food and great atmosphere.  You have to try the deviled eggs appetizer! We couldn't stop at one order with my group!"}
{"text":"This place should have way more customers but doesn't due to an unfortunate location. The PBLT and Bootlegger burger are mighty tasty. Try the Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce if you be of the dippin' persuasion."}
{"text":"Sampled the brisket at the farmers market. Despite being cold, it was amazingly tender & flavorful. So made my way here for lunch. The restaurant is modern industrial. It's a smokehouse so you might smell a little smoked on the patio but it's all good. Extensive selection of beers and fun spirits w/ moonshine. Informed, happy staff. The food was fresh & flavorful. Try the guacamole (YUM!) and the wings. Yes, the pulled pork sandwich and brisket are great or go for any of the salmon dishes: BLT, tacos or entree! One friend had the green pork tacos - three tacos w/ good portion of meat. Sample some apple pie moonshine for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. The selection was small. Maybe the thing that makes this place a miss is that I was unable to substitute another dish for the cole slaw. The same two sides for every entree, and no substitutions? It makes me feel they are more interested in making things simple and profitable for them than making sure I get what I like. Too many barbeque places who will offer what I like. And when I asked if there was something else I could get beside the cole slaw, the server said, \"No.\" Not, \"I'm sorry there isn't.\" Or, \"The manager won't let us.\" Just, \"No.\" Will we eat here again? No."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious and the wait staff is awesome! The menu prices seem steep at first, but the serving sizes are very large and most meals are platter types for the whole family. I highly recommend this place. Make sure you go with plenty of time, this is not a short order or quick serving place."}
{"text":"Happy hour apps and beer were good. Very tender brisket that wasn't dry,  which is a nice change from most I've had in AZ. Nice Street tacos as  well."}
{"text":"I just left this place and here's what I thought.  Ambience was great Waitstaff very nice Kids meals were phenomenal for the price Adult entrees are pricey   It's not traditional bbq. Not a lot of combos available.  I had to order a 1/2 rack of ribs and an order of brisket just to try them both since if never been here. I asked for a side salad instead of tortillas because I don't eat white flour. The salad was 5 bites of lettuce in an oversized ramekin and was $3 up charge. If it was a normal sized dinner salad the $3 wouldn't have mattered but it was literally 5 bites. The waitress told me the ribs were $14 but were actually $19  Ribs were just ok Brisket was PHENOMENAL Kids burger and pulled pork sliders were amazing  The waitress even gave us a bag of their homemade potato chips to go.   I'll definitely return for the kids meals and brisket."}
{"text":"Made reservations here on a Monday. Wasn't necessary as it wasn't so busy at the beginning of the week. But the food was excellent, I love how the meats are smoked all day. My girlfriend and I got the meat sampler for two. Definitely a filling meal. Out of the three BBQ sauces, we both favored their original recipe. And the ribs fall right off the bine! The pulled pork was tasty too. Beautiful lighting and a neat set up!"}
{"text":"I was able to check out Bootleggers for their soft open and was totally blown away.   First off, I knew they had remodeled, but definitely didn't expect such a cool atmosphere! Everything from the rustic barn wood and brick, to the lighting and music. It has ambiance suitable for a date night, but still comfortable / casual enough to be your neighborhood bar and grill.   Second, the staff was super impressive, I could tell this isn't their first rodeo!   And finally, the food and drinks! Sitting at the bar I noticed a nice selection of moderately priced vino (that's my thing), a bartender making fancy looking cocktail and another crackin' open a cold PBR! A little something for everyone, awesome.  Then I was able to try a Pork Belly BLT and then a Cheeseburger Slider on a pretzel bun - both were seriously delicious!   I think a lot of new restaurants try way too hard to be cutting edge and over think their menu. Ninety-nine percent of the time, all I really want is a nice atmosphere, staff with personality, and food I know I like, just made better than I could at home. So, way to go Bootleggers! This place is solid!"}
{"text":"Great food and even greater service. Suede-swayed-Swade was an amazing server!!! Will definitely come back. Good for dates or groups of friends. John is the bomb also - took personal care of us. Very astute and attentive."}
{"text":"Service was great, atmosphere relaxed, food and drinks delicious. Live music was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I loved it!!! We ordered wings with Bbq and nachos with brisket meat!!! So uniques served on a cookie sheet!! Thank you old town tours for the heads up!!!"}
{"text":"Smokehouse is the keyword. The meats made were definitely smokey.  We had the smoked mussels to start and it was very flavorful. It came with toasted bread to soak in the dripping sauce that came with the sizzling ironed platter. Although the mussels meat were a bit small, it didn't matter because it was just appetizers to start.  I ordered the smokey brisket tacos and my fiancé ordered the smokey ribs entree. Both were so delicious and filling. We also tasted moonshine which is what they're known.  I'm definitely trying other flavors when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Best combination of salad and choices of smoked meats.  Service fantastic!.  A must.  Stan"}
{"text":"I am a smoked meat aficionado. I was very happy with my brisket so my wife and I went again. The 2nd time my meat was very fatty, much to my surprise.  HOWEVER, our waitress took back my plate and brought me a whole new meal.  I was VERY happy with the service and the food.  ONE SUGGESTION, make peach cobbler without blueberries.... please.  If you have a chance try the apple pie moonshine too.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's hard to describe this place - it's like a smokehouse with a very upscale twist. Everything is a cut above what you would have a normal smokehouse. Very very tasty."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but service and food were a little disappointing. The bacon board is a nice starter to try different cuts of pork, but some of the bacon was just too soggy. I thought service was slow and inattentive. Our entree orders were taken after we had already finished eating the appetizers. I liked the chips and potato fries (upcharge). but meat dishes I tried (brisket, ribs) were too dry and salty. I also found drink portions a little small. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. Not much else to do in the area anyways. Split check for for 5 people:  2 apps, 4 mains, 4 drinks was about $30/pp."}
{"text":"After walking into the fairly dim restaurant for lunch, I had a mini-panic attack. I thought, \"how am I going to take pictures of my food!?!\" Luckily there's some outdoor seating! While being led outside, I noticed the modern rustic decor. I liked the pops of orange throughout the restaurant. Coincidentally, they get a lot of SF Giants fans because the training camp is nearby (Go Giants! Now you need to start an odd-year winning streak!)  The upside to sitting outside is the natural lighting. The bbq smoker is in the same area, so the downside is that you end up smelling like smoked meats. I guess some could view that as an upside, too. Hey, whatever makes you happy.   The food was pretty delicious! Everything was pretty much made in-house accept the bread and tortillas. The bacon board ($24) was beautiful. It contained slices of pork belly on each end, cherrywood smoked bacon, jalapeño bacon, pepper bacon, sweet onion jam, red pepper jam, mustard, pickles and bread.  My husband had the green chile pork tacos ($12). We had so much food I had forgotten to get a taste but he said they were really good. We're used to street-style tacos having 2 tortillas but these only had one. However, they were sturdy enough and didn't fall apart.   The french dip ($16) was tender and flavorful. A dip in the au jus made it extra moist & juicy. The au jus, though, was a bit too salty IMHO.   The beef brisket ($17) was served with tortillas, coleslaw and bbq sauce. I was offered their spicy bbq sauce but I passed. Being from San Francisco and sitting outside in the Arizona sun, I didn't need anything else to make me hotter. = p  Anyways, the brisket was so good! I loved the texture of the tortilla; filled with the brisket and coleslaw, and dipped in the bbq sauce was the perfect combo. The bbq sauce added a bit of sweetness but not too much. The coleslaw itself wasn't too sweet or tangy like most slaws I've had and it provided the perfect crunch and textural contrast needed for the perfect bite.   The service was just as good as the food. The price point was just a bit too high.   By the way, the bathroom sinks are a trip! They look almost completely flat but tilt downward ever so slightly towards the back. My daughter wants one in our house now...haha!"}
{"text":"Great ribs turkey is a bit dry but that happens when you smoke it."}
{"text":"First, the brisket was excellent! Cooked perfectly and tasted great. However, the sides that came with the brisket were mediocre at best. The coleslaw only had an onion flavor and the tortilla was just strange to be a part of that entree.   The service was a bit slow and the orange metal chairs were not very comfortable. I would probably come back again, but I would have to get different sides to go with my brisket."}
{"text":"I see all theses reviews about great service, our service was HORRIBLE! We ordered a $1 apple pie shot, which was great, but we ordered it before anything else and it arrived half way into our meal. We ordered a side with our food, and it came out before our actual food. We then ordered a second drink during dinner, and it came out after dinner, wtf! The food was meh, the lack of service really made the experience poor. We got the sampler, and the best part was the dr pepper bbq sauce."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. From the decoration to the food. Food is excellent and very reasonably priced.  I thought going into old town it was just going to be a generic place but it really had a lot.of character."}
{"text":"Good food overshadowed by shoddy service. This place needs to make some serious adjustments.  4 stars - Environment - Amazing exposed beams and duct work. Booth seats are comfy, but the metal orange chairs don't lend themselves to extended seating. Amazing lighting and fan details. Low lighting but gets loud in the dining room when the place gets full.   Bathroom needed attention. The cool orange accents and subway tiles didn't make up for the fact that the place looked like a college bar at midnight.   3 stars - Service - Making a reservation feels like an SNL skit, but a lot less funny. When you call, you hear a generic voice telling you you have dialed (insert phone number). Press 1 for the smoke house, two for the meat house, three for the restaurant, and zero for customer service. What? Wasn't sure what to do with this. We made a joke of it. I called four times and left a message in each mailbox. No one called me back. :)  We had to beg for a 5:45 reservation. A large party was coming in at 7:30 and they didn't know if they could accommodate us. We assured them we would be quick, and they granted us a reservation.   We seemed to have an invisible waitress. Our waitress came by our table just once - to take our order. No questions about the food. No questions on getting us anything else. We never saw her until I flagged down the chef and waved him over. He clearly requested that she visit our table. She seemed annoyed to have to come back to our table a second time - at the end of the meal. She muttered an apology about having to prepare for the large group. We didn't bother ordering a second round - not that they even asked if we wanted another drink. They did not.   4 stars - Food - We tried the sampler for 2: Smoked turkey was a little salty, but tasty and moist. Brisket was outstanding. Ribs were a little fatty. The links were hot and tasty. Chicken was tasty and moist. You could almost order this as an appetizer for a group of 3 or 4. It's a great way to decide what you'd like to order as an entree.  Cole slaw was nice and creamy, and the kale salad was perfectly prepared. The kale salad could be a small meal if you're not hungry, or is something that could be shared.   The salmon was a small portion, but was delicious. I would not recommend this dish for sharing. Cauliflower was a little bland. Chips were crisped to perfection and went well with the BBQ. Brisket on a bun was superb and worth trying.   I wish I could be more excited about this place. I'd be willing to try again. Maybe. If nothing else catches my attention."}
{"text":"This place is so dang good!! I'm not sure how long it's been there, but I wish I found it sooner. My wife and I keep looking for good BBQ places, and this turned out to be just down the street from where we live. UNREAL brisket and brisket tacos (the green chili pork tacos are really good too), and I thought the ribs were so unique from other BBQ restaurants I've tried, and my wife really loves the smoked muscles they have, another really unique dish! By far our new favorite, not just BBQ place but maybe our favorite restaurant/bar in the area! Pretty good drinks too, and great happy hour deals."}
{"text":"I attended a work event at Bootleggers and think the restaurant did a great job setting up our group in the back room and setting up a buffet of good food. I really liked the mac & cheese which was al dente pasta with a cheesy sauce, with an extra layer of melted cheese on top. The fried pickles, battered with a seasoned coating like curly fries, were good too. They have many beers on draft, including local beers. The atmosphere is upscale country."}
{"text":"Food is ok but over priced. I ordered take out; one salad, one sandwich and one appeatizer. It was 46 dollars, with no drinks.  I was told it would take 20 to 25 minutes. I arived 20 minutes later and then had to wait another 30 minutes. What could have possibly taken that long?"}
{"text":"What a big disappointment!  Waited 10 min. just to get a menu. After finally ordering, I was told there was no smoked turkey. So I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. What they brought out was a turkey melt??  Finally after my wife had finished her sandwich, my pulled pork sandwich came out. It was mediocre at best. We didn't even get any barbecue sauce.   Adding insult to injury when the check came, we were informed that we would not be charged for the turkey melt that we had not ordered. Lucky us!  No apologies, bad service, and overpriced mediocre food. No, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Have been probably a half dozen times, tried several entrees and moonshines. You MUST order the apple pie moonshine when you sit. Everything here has been good, albeit heavy. Bootlegger burger is a fav, smoked turkey has been least fav, but nothing objectionable. I've ordered the cauliflower steak as an app a few times. A flight of moonshine is a must for passing around. Ambience is sort of \"mod/barnwood.\""}
{"text":"Okay, another SLAM DUNK to report in Phoenix area.  Bootleggers is a great place off Shea and the 51.  Get to Shea and you are there.  Environment was cozy, cool music, great prices and friendly staff.  Need I say more?  Probably not, but you know I will anyway.  The BBQ here is phenomenal.  I saw the BBQ smoker in the back and if that doesn't make you hungry there is something wrong with you.  We ordered the hot wings (good), the hamburger (great, right up there with my all time valley favorite Bobby Q's - of the 17) and the pulled pork with coleslaw on top (AMAZEBALLS)!!    The general manger Jacob came over.  Guy is as cool as it gets.  We enjoyed a cold beer (Oak Brown Nut Ale of course), oh yeah, and THEY SELL MOONSHINE!!  Oh yeah.......try the one with applce cider flavoring - DELISH.  At any rate, place is like one year old, great vibe, so get out there and give them some business.  Aside from Bobby Q's (which also gets a 5) this is a repeat visit waiting to happen and the best on this side of dodge.  Parking is a breeze and this place will not disapoint.  Thanks for making this fun guys.  Have fun, and Find your Sizzle.  Attorney Steve, the Business & Real Estate lawyer http://www.attorneysteve.net"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Our group sampled the cheesesteaks and brisket tacos.  Both were great and the local beer choice was impressive.  Great patio with the smell of the smoke (no you are not covered in smoke) motivates your appetite."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed. Beef briscuit flavorless and dry. Barbeque sauce very ordinary and very small portion (though more promptly provided after request)    Baby back ribs very ordinary. Would never recommend this place to friends. Also, restaurant so dimly lit that reading the menu was a huge challenge. Prior positive reviews proved highly misleading."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Sunday lunch here. The place wasn't crowded at all. The brisket and pulled pork was amazing! Great service. The establishment was clean. Staff was attentive. Great location, in the heart of old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and have really enjoyed the food and service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is sadly it has been too quiet inside they need to add music or something because when you go and it's not very busy you wonder why the place isn't hopping. The food is truly delicious. The only thing that I was bummed out about on the menu is the beet salad, I was hoping for a bunch of big beets but it really had very little amount of beets in it. Give it a try though you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had a few beers, got the brisket sandwich and green beans. The green beans had a citrus flavor to them that I really enjoyed, and the brisket was mildly spicy which I never thought I'd enjoy but when I finished it I was considering ordering one more. I must have looked like I was enjoying it, because the lady next to me asked for the exact same meal and said she loved it as well. Can't wait to try out more things on the menu"}
{"text":"I came here with family on Halloween before seeing The Book of Mormon and oh my goodness, to say that it is foodie friendly is an understatement! I did not have a bite of one average dish. I LOVED the deviled eggs, steak tartare and boot-schetta (the flavors were insane!). For my entree, I enjoyed the Sliced Prime NY Strip that was served with GOAT CHEESE red mashed potatoes. Yup, my tastebuds were dancing! Even if you're not a big BBQ fan (like me), this place WILL definitely have something for you! The only reason for the 4 stars is that the night we were there, it was 5:30 PM and the service was a tad slow (even though we were the only ones there at that time) and we had to run into the show (literally) but hey, our tummies were happy and that is all that matters, right?? Thank you, Bootleggers! I will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Great smoked prime rib. This was our second visit. Service was wonderful and drink recommendations were spot on. Also had the fried Mac and Cheese balls. Those were not too bad.  Also had the chicken but seemed a little dry."}
{"text":"What a great find!! On a tip from a fellow traveler that we met that day, we decided to check out Bootleggers for dinner last night. As a native Texan, I'm pretty picky about BBQ, so I wasn't sure of what to expect in Arizona... but Bootleggers did not disappoint!! I would highly recommend the nachos as a starter, which are covered in all types of deliciousness (guacamole, cheese, Jalepenos, brisket, etc), and the brisket itself was great as an entree. Our server, Dana, was super friendly and made sure to explain everything as well as provide recommendations for us first-timers.  They also have a good craft beer selection on tap, which I found to be a nice change from the other local places which didn't have much selection. If you're feeling adventurous, try their apple pie moonshine. Packs a punch but tastes just like pie."}
{"text":"OMG! Where do I start??? Phenomal establishment! Previous reviewers has chatted it up about the bacon board, so I won't harp on it. But, listen to me people...GET IT! You'll be mad at yourself if you don't. The barbeque board was great too! The servings are plentiful for two or more people. I ate so much I looked like a potbelly pig when I walked out. Wash everything down with a jar of moonshine! I tried several favors! :-) I was a happy camper ya'll! The staff were on point with recommendations, order taking, or just for small talk. Great date night place, epecially if you like sharing!"}
{"text":"everyone there is very nice.  bill the bartender is great! had the bbq sampler and i liked the pork the best ......so i always get the bbq pork. comes with a few tortillas and it's awesome!  mac and cheese is great and the smashed potato's are good too! wish they had some awesome baked beans but it is still great!   stiff drinks aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Delicious! Best bbq food I've had in a long time. The service (Amy and Robin) was amazing and very attentive. Recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great local joint, very good pulled pork, good beer selection, good for dinner or watching a game.  I like the menu a lot, excited to go back soon."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious.  We had the Bootlegger Burger and St Louis ribs with a side of the goat cheese mashed potatoes.  All were cooked perfectly and were delicious and different than traditional fare. The service by Regina was attentive and friendly. Downsides were they were not cheap but not bad for the food quality, no wet naps as one would expect in a barbeque/rib joint, and although they said they had put in WiFi Regina did not know the password to allow us to use it. I would come here again to taste the other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Every cocktail I have had has been amazing...just the right amount of ingredients to be flavorful and strong but not overpowering. The bartender is friendly and attentive when you need something but never hovers when you don't. Her service is professional and stylish and she knows how to make a good drink. The manager is super friendly and makes a point to stop and say hi and welcome new patrons. The music and vibe is right on point. I love the dim lighting and wood cabinet back bar. And the food is delicious in that its probably not that healthy but tastes sooo good way.  It's so nice to have a hip spot on this side of Shea and not have to always go to Scottsdale for a great place!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience!! My sister ordered their house Apple Pie moonshine drink and she really liked it. I ordered the brick chicken and my hubs ordered the prime rib. The brick chicken was nice and tender. The prime rib was seasoned well and had a really nice rustic smokey taste. My sister and hubs ordered the platter for 2. They said the meats were very soft and tender. Overall, everyone enjoyed their meal. Win!! Will recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a quick drink before dinner and I was blown away by the bartender and the menu.   The drinks were very delicious especially the \"Mean Green\". The menu looked outstanding so we decided to stay and dine in there.  Had the dumpling which I didn't like too much because they were pan seared, the tri tip pork sandwich which was OK but I would highly recommend the steak tar tar.  It's a cool hip place with excellent service Sara I would definitely recommend. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the food is not that tasty as it appears on the menu description."}
{"text":"OK... had to add that 5th star, cuz it's only been a few days and I'm already craving that pulled pork sandwich again. That flashback factor is awesome. :)"}
{"text":"While we've seen the sign,we never tried this restaurant until last night. Pleasantly surprised, great atmosphere and terrific service. We both had The smoked prime rib that came with goat cheese mash potatoes and Broccoli Rabe.  The only problem was that the broccoli Rabe was actually Broccolini - not a fan.   Our server told us that we were the second guests that mentioned it this evening, The chef of the evening told the waitress that's what they normally serve with the prime - my only problem is that they should change the menu description.  Overall, good quality food extremely great service and nice atmosphere.  I only wish I remembered the servers name so I can give her props.  Try this place, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"This past weekend we decided to celebrate my husband's birthday early and try out Bootleggers.  I had made a reservation about a week prior because I thought a Saturday night would be really busy.  Then I found out that they were going to be on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives the day before.  That made me think they were going to be REALLY busy.  I generally try to avoid peak times, but we kept our 7:30 reservation anyway.  We were staying in Old Town overnight, so if we needed extra drinks to deal with a crowd, so be it.    We arrived at the restaurant a little early and were seated right away.  I love the candles and dim lighting.  It was a perfect atmosphere, and not nearly as crowded as I thought it might be.  We started with the boot dumplings ($9) which were delicious and disappeared in about 4.2 seconds.  Our cocktails were the Bathtub gin made with Hendrick's ($10) and I had The Flapper ($11).  Both were tasty, but The Flapper is delicious!  I could have had a couple more of those and spent a ridiculous amount of money, but managed to behave myself.    For my entree I ordered the Brick Chicken ($18) and my husband ordered the smoked prime rib ($24).  My chicken dish was nice.  Nothing that I would crave again, but very nice.  The chicken was tender and had flavorful crispy skin in places, and the capers added a nice briney accent to the dish.    My husband's prime rib was really exceptional and a great value for the price.  He ordered the goat cheese mashed potatoes which were AMAZING!  What a flavor.  I kept saying, \"There's gotta be real cream in there!\"  Well who knows, but those are delicious.    We did not save room for dessert and even had a little bit of prime rib and mashed potatoes left over that we had for breakfast a couple of days later.  Our server, for the most part, was attentive and friendly, but towards the end of our meal when we should have been checked on for refills on water, a 2nd cocktail, or dessert, she spent a lot of time chatting with friends at the bar.  She did notice me getting my credit card out and was right over with the check and a togo box.    All in with tax, before tip, the total was $77.72 and was an excellent birthday dinner.  Overall I would definitely want to make a return trip to try dessert and that prime rib french dip for sure.  And this would be a fun place to take out of town guests.  I'm glad they were on Triple D because usually that means their business is going to go through the roof."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and Great service.  Kudos to John Murphy for a delicious lunch. Park in the Public two level ramp which is free."}
{"text":"Found my new favorite restaurant!!! The atmosphere is really cool and the service was great. I had the PBLT with the Cottage Fries. The entire meal was bomb.com! Lol...  Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"great service, but fatty ribs and brisket.  The apple pie moonshine helped to forget how many Weight Watcher points we were eating."}
{"text":"Awesome prime ribs, delicious apps, great beers, superb service from Dana...and ask for the bread"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places I've eaten at!!! Service excellent!!! I don't like coke slaw- but this was one of the best I've ever eaten. Sausage prefect!! Recommend with 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because we like BBQ and this seemed like the ideal restaurant, decent reviews and the constant reminder about 'diners drive ins and dives' - so we went here expecting good things.  The restaurant is quite dark inside, which was a little off, but anyway, service was okay, little slow even without the place being too busy.  Started with wings and macaroni balls, wings pretty bland and macaroni was a little dry - entrees were good, ribs were nice, not the best I've had and pulled pork was good- overall a decent restaurant- but don't let the 'diners drive ins and dives' sway you - this is an average restaurant at best."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good bbq in Arizona. Why? because most folks here make better bbq at home than at restaurants! That being said, I am always on the lookout for a go-to bbq place and Bootleggers so far has my attention.  Let's start with the bad: and it's really just one thing - the chairs! omg are they uncomfortable! I am talking about those yellow/orange patio chairs in the dining room! From the moment I sat down till I left, the chairs were making me hate the experience. I am not disabled or elderly, but little stocky (6'1 250lbs), and the chair was pure torture. Those that get to sit on the booth side, are ok, but I will never dine there if I have to sit in that chair again. Just saying. Now the good: everything else!  The service was good, nothing memorable. I'll chalk it up to a busy Saturday night that our waiter, when asked if I want my entree (which really was an app on the menu) to arrive before or with the other entrees, did not listen to my response! Since I was treating the Nacho Flat as my entree, I asked that it come out with everyone else's food. Nope - came out way early and I was done with my meal before anyone else at my table received theirs. The waiter did not have the situational awareness to see what a mistake he had made. I'll give the place a pass on this, just this once. I still tipped over 20%, despite the rather egregious service error. The food however, is really good. The Nacho Flat didn't feel like just a plate of nachos at a bar etc... it was a whole meal, with delicious meat and crispy chips.  But let me cut to the chase, as opposed to describing the menu items: the beef brisket and the pulled pork are fantastic!  so whatever your order, as long as it has one of those items, you are in a for a great smokey bbq tastegasm.  The sides were pretty good too - the mashed potatoes with goat cheese, and cauliflower puree had a wonderful consistency and were flavorful. But this place is really about the brisket and the pulled pork. 'Nuff said.  Being slightly pricey - in line with most Old Town Scottsdale restaurants, Bootlegger's is not a place I can go to often, but when we really need to go out for bbq, this is usually the first on our list of options."}
{"text":"Moonshine! Oh yeah, they have it and in many delicious flavors. I will admit I tried a few...purely for my Yelp review's sake, of course. See what a good Yelper I am! :)  The booze was good, the food was even better! They have done an amazing job with the menu and everything I tried was uber yummy!  The interior is dark and sets the mood for a perfect date night! I found it to be a little loud, but that is to be expected when you mix good food, lots of people and strong liquor! It wasn't rowdy but it was loud. I can over look that though because of all of the other great things Bootleggers has going for it!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner at the bar with the fabulous Jameson ( he's their fabulous bartender). I ordered the brisket nachos- delicious. The guacamole is on point. Came on a Monday night - relaxing, watched the game."}
{"text":"Restaurant week meal #1 for my stepfather and I. I appreciate how they decided to do it - instead of selecting from a limited menu of appetizer, entree and dessert, each person is served smaller portions of 3 apps, 2 entrees and 1 dessert. What a great way to sample what the kitchen can do!  Apps:  - Baked potato soup - fantastic! would definitely order it again! - Short rib with grilled pear, brussel sprouts and goat gouda salad with grilled lemon vinaigrette. The dressing was a bit too acidic - but a little tweak on that and this could be one of my favorite dishes in town! The flavor, texture, color and shape composition is spot on. One of the most well conceived apps I have seen in a long time. - Smoked turkey grilled cheese - meh. It wasn't bad...just bland and boring and nothing special at all.  Entrees: - Chicken and pumpkin pie waffles with egg and maple red eye gravy. I have been singing the praises of chicken and waffles for years. Now my stepfather is a convert, based on this dish. We did specifically ask to speak with the manager to beg this be added to the menu. Perfectly executed! - Smoked pork belly steak. (with bing cherry bbq sauce, swiss chard, guerro chile, leeks and white bean puree) It's pork belly. That's all you need to know. YUM.  Dessert: Cornbread pudding, chipotle huckleberry jam, bourbon caramel corn. Never would have considered this for a dessert if there were any other options. Luckily, there weren't. It was an out of left field amazing hit!  We were both pleased and impressed with the food quality, presentation and combinations.  There are a few service snags that need to be worked on, though. Flatware is wrapped in napkins, already on the table when seated. Fork and knife only. If it's decided most diners won't need a spoon, when you serve an appetizer that includes soup, please deliver a spoon WITH the food.  Once the soup was delivered and we realized we were spoonless, we were unable to catch the attention of any staff member, my stepfather had to approach the hostess for spoons. Our forks and knives were bussed away with our entree plates - our desserts were delivered with no forks. (I snagged two more napkin rolls from the empty table next to us so we could start dessert. About halfway though, the hostess came by with long forgotten forks for our dessert course.)  Nothing that would stop me from coming back. No dealbreakers at all - and I do look forward to coming back. Just time to work on some front of the house snags...  Still definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"We liked the atmosphere here but the waiter was a little short with us. But the foot was average. Great drinks and loved the vibe."}
{"text":"This is a grest ecperience....i had the salmon it was done perfectly as well as the rice with it. The wairer eas friendly, attentive and efficient.Needless to say i will be back"}
{"text":"The moonshine is a great option, I tried a few and enjoyed them a lot! I like what they did with the space and I will go back for drinks sometime. The food was not up to par. I had the pulled pork and it was one of the most lackluster pulled pork plates I've ever had. They were serving a crawfish boil that night and the guy at the table next to me ordered it. It looks \"blah\" to me. I'm very disappointed in the food experience, but ambiance and bar options were good."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ for sure. We started with a couple of their signature drinks - one of their moonshine drinks and a bourbon drink (don't remember the names) but very nicely done. The bacon board and kitchen sink guacamole were both great choices for apps. For entrees we did the brisket tacos, smoked prime rib and half rack of ribs. Talk about smokey deliciousness. The food is top grade and beats most of the SC BBQ joints I've been too.  The service was excellent as well. Very casual, laid back and helpful. Spent time with us when we asked thugs and didn't cut anything short.   I'll definitely be back on my next visit to the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch and wasn't thrilled with my experience. Managers talking in a corner were more concerned with themselves than checking on the guest. Had to ask the bartender repeatedly for another drink, a silverware set, and water. Food was okay. Will not be back"}
{"text":"The 5 of us sat down, waited for 12 minutes without service or acknowledgement.  Wasn't busy at all (5pm Saturday).  So unfortunate, have been to the Phoenix location several times and the service was great.  We love in Paradise Valley so kind of in between both locations.  Ended up going to AZ 88, We refuse to support a business that is not LGBT friendly or just doesn't provide good service."}
{"text":"We ate the bacon board so fast we forgot to take a picture.  It was yummy.  Before writing the rest of the review, be aware, this place is expensive.  The $3 happy hour tacos are delicious but extremely small.  The happy hour wine was acceptable but small.  The moonshine flight was extremely tasty but just 3oz total.  We will be back because the food was good.  The air was too high in the bar so we ate outside which worked out well.  No smokers on our visit.  Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Checked this place out per yelp reviews we read and from the suggestion of our uber driver.  However, we all found this place to be disappointing.  Specifically, we ordered sweet potato fries for the table when we sat down b/c we were hungry and wanted to get some food ASAP.  However, the fries came out after our food orders did, and they were room temp, so we had to send them back to be reheated.  They were decent on the 2nd try, but the point was already lost since our food had come out.  We tried the beef and pork BBQ and it was good enough.  I felt that the sauces are trying to be too fancy and end up falling short.  The entire experience just left our group with something still to be desired."}
{"text":"The food is was legit. We had the deviled eggs to start and the wings. The beet sauce on the deviled eggs was delicious and the wings were extra crispy and delicious (we got the honey sriracha flavor). I got the chicken for dinner, hubby got the prime rib and our friend got the half rack. Everything was really good. The server didn't have a bunch of detailed recommendations to make (given it was our first time at the restaurant) but she was attentive and provided great service."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!  Definitely a hole in the wall, but once inside the place you will love the atmosphere.  Charming and inviting.  A terrific find!  BBQ Brisket, our favorite"}
{"text":"While we were walking around Scottsdale we kept smelling some amazing bbq and discovered it was this place! We each had a San Tan Hef. We then shared the brisket sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich with cottage fries and sweet potato fries. The brisket was my favorite! Both were really good! And it's worth the upgrade to get the sweet and cottage fries! At the end the waitress gave us a sample of their house made apple pie moonshine....so good!!! Overall a really nice lunch!"}
{"text":"Went back with a group and had a very nice lunch. First of all - bacon board - assorted types of bacon as a starter. Are you getting this?  Bacon, bacon, and more bacon!!!  Got the 2 meat combo with brisket and hot links.  Pretty good. Sauce could use a bit more kick.  Fun place to go - go in a group so you can get the bacon board!!!"}
{"text":"Great little place hidden off the highway. The food was pretty good (I had the BBLT, fiance had the brisket nachos), came out hot and was appetizing to the pallet and the eyes. The decor of the place is nice, I like the low light atmosphere. They had live entertainment when we went and while the guy was good, it was pretty loud on the speakers so it was hard to have a conversation. On top of the food being great, the service was fantastic. We kind of had a combo of two people serving on us and both were terrific. Very polite, friendly, on top of everything and they knew the menu to make great suggestions. My only knock on the place was that the music was too loud for a restaurant and I'm not a fan of $9-$10 cocktails. When cocktails are the same price as food, it's a little offsetting. Overall, I would definitely return and suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Justin is the bartender in the mornings/afternoons and does an absolutely wonderful job! He's knowledgeable about the bar and food, and is great conversationalist! He really does a great job between keeping that bar spotless and taking care of all his guests. The food is also pretty great! The deviled eggs, brisket tacos, prime rib (only at night), BBQ sampler and the chicken sandwich are phenom! Go try it and see Justin!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, tvs and some unique items as well.. best BBQ in the area.. always do the brisket.. good sauce.. check it out"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the following: bacon board, moonshine flights, macaroni and cheese, and their brisket is unreal!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! The brisket and ribs were excellent and were a generous portion. I had the brisket tacos based on previous recommendations, and they did not disappoint. Two of us had the wedge salad, which was to die for! The corn on the cob ( which was out of season), was mushy and not so good. Rudy, our server, was attentive and seemed to really enjoy his work. We'd return, for sure!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience for us!  Four of us went out to Bootleggers in Phoenix because we were in the area and the one in Scottsdale was good so -- why not?  We were seated pretty quickly - we asked for the booth but it was under a reservation that was already late. They said they would move us but never did (and the reservation never showed). After looking over the menu for 10 minutes we realized no one has stopped by our table to ask us if we wanted drinks or not. So we asked the hostess to send over our waiter if possible.   Our waitress Tami (not our actual waitress but the girl who was going to take care of us) came over and said \"I was told no one has stopped by your table! So I am going to help you out.\" Awesome, by this time (15+ minutes sitting there without drinks - other than the water the bus boy left) we were ready to order. So we ordered it all and waited. Someone at our table ordered coffee and I ordered iced tea - everyone else had water.   I asked for a straw when my tea came out that I never got and I was never offered sugar or anything for the tea. When the coffee came out she was holding it and telling us that it made her hands warm. Awesome, but can you NOT hold the cup in the place where I drink it? I hate it when someone hands me my drink and your fingers are touching where my mouth goes. NOT OK. Also - no \"do you want cream or sugar?\" nothing.   So, we went to find the hostess and ask for some cream and sugar for the coffee after waiting another 5 or so minutes with nothing coming out. She said \"yeah it's in the fridge\" and eventually brought it out to our table (mind you I still have no straw and no sugar).   Then we receive our food. It was dry and overcooked. My pulled pork was flavorful but dry and overcooked. Once we received our food, she never came back to us. Until it was time to pay. It isn't like it was super busy. I am glad we apparently didn't need anything else. This was SUCH a ridiculous disappointment after having such a good experience in Scottsdale.   Overall - it was not worth the money we spent or the time and frustration.   Go to the one in Scottsdale instead."}
{"text":"Rustic atmosphere, good food and fun selection of adult beverages.  Had a moonshine flight, that was very tasty."}
{"text":"After waiting over 40 minutes for a cranberry/club soda and one margarita, without receiving them we left. The waitress apologized three times during our wait but never delivered the drinks much less took a food order. We asked about the Wednesday prime rib special and as it was a Wednesday she stated that it was delicious. Another employee told her they haven't had it for weeks. It is the most highlighted item on menu.? Place seems management challenged. New and un-trained employees. We have been before once and the service was worse. They did not have a bartender was the explanation as we departed. Another table, was yelling at another employee about the lack of a drink. The place is close and seemed neighborly. I will not go back. Later, it was pointed out to us that it had recently had several health violations. Tables were left with dirty plates. Very few patrons, can quickly see why. I will never return. Can only imagine how the kitchen operates."}
{"text":"Happy hour everyday, and all day Sunday! My type of place. Their in-house made apple pie moonshine.. is a little bit too delicious. I could easily drink it as a dessert, not taste the alcohol and get unexpectedly drunk... so get it! Also, the food here was phenomenal. We had the deviled eggs- perfectly done and I loved the beet sauce they came with! The wings were good, the mashed cauliflower puree was so creamy and the beef tartare with egg on top.. was great- if you are into the raw beef thing ;) I loved the industrial vibe and cocktails- but the food was certainly the star at this place. Kudos to the chefs because the quality of food was really great, especially for the mid range price it was at."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Thursday night. First, our waitresses kept switching. The smokinghouse margarita was horrible, had to return. My husband ordered the special,  Boot Bacon Bomb, it was dry and salty, not worth the price. I got the brisket, it was dry and not worth the price. Our friends did not enjoy their dinner either. We would not go back."}
{"text":"One of my new favorites!  Service: 5/5 The staff was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  Enviorment: 5/5 The place is named Bootleggers so it's no surprise that you walk in and get that late 20s early 30s feel. The lighting is pretty dim and to add that extra bit of romance, there is a candle on every table; if this is a first date and you don't look exactly like your profile picture or the other person was a little tipsy when they gave you their phone number...this is the place for you! Besides the lighting, I LOVE the decor.  Food: 5/5 Most important part!!! I came here for the bacon board...Yummmy! I'm talking 5 different kinds of bacon with two spicy jams, home made mustard, pickles and cheesy bread. Yes it was $24 but my bf and I agreed that it was worth it! I would just go for bacon and wine if the opportunity ever presented itself. For entrees I got the turkey leg, coleslaw and mac n cheese and my bf got the brisket, coleslaw and black beans. We both loved our food but I wanted to give special attention to the mac n cheese...first off I'm super picky when it comes to mac n cheese because it is one of my favorite foods, and I usually never like mac n cheese outside of mine or my mom's...but let me tell you, AMAZING MACARONI AND CHEESE!!!  Altogether including a beer cost us $71.95 before tip (includes 1 beer, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees)."}
{"text":"went in for a late lunch.  I was the only one there and the staff seemed somewhat put-off that I was there on off hours.  I sat in the outside area.  I was swarmed by small flies the entire time I was there.  They were all over the table, my arms, and the silverware.  I ordered Brisket & Pulled Pork. lunch express special.  I was brought brisket and turkey.  I waited 5 or so minutes for someone to come check on me and told them of the mess-up.  They rolled their eyes, came back in a few mins and brought the pulled pork and apologized.  The brisket had good flavor but was really really dry.  Like it was yesterdays leftovers.  The pulled pork was very good.  great portion.  I would not return here.  much better options with better service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Cool little BBQ joint in Old Town Scottsdale. The smell of smoked meats hit you right when you walk into the door...you can tell they smoke their meats right outside the restaurant. Everyone enjoyed heir food from the kale salad to the bbq and salmon BLT. But I think the real winner was the nachos as an appetizer - they are a must get!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since I drove by...then recently for my splurge meal during Arizona Restaurant Week, we decided to try Bootleggers. I made a reservation and was seated promptly in the private dining room. It was actually a surprise to me that I was able to be seated so quickly, I went in with the expectation I would be waiting approximately 10 minutes or so just because it was AZRW. The service was decent, I could tell the server was just overwhelmed. He did as best as he could. When our food came out, there was a minor issue, with the fries but we addressed it with the food runner and he came back with the correct fries within 5 minutes. We ordered a sampler for 2 and it came with tortilla. I am not a huge fan of ribs and I demolished the ribs on the platter. By the end of the meal, our waiter was apologetic about not being able to spend more time with us because he has been running around nonstop since he started his shift. He did make some recommendations on what we need to order for next time. Yes we will be coming back next time."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally made it there this weekend. We were a party of 5 and seated immediately with a reservation. We ordered drinks and appetizers. The bruschetta with the peaches and goat cheese was tasty. The honey Siracha wings were fantastic and we just might go back and only order those. Everyone tried something different from turkey, to pulled pork, ribs, brisket, and the hamburger and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. The only negatives we had were was one person had a sprite that was a bit on the flat side, the Long Island iced tea had way too strong of a lemon flavor and the cole slaw that came with many of our meals was nothing special but I never expect much cole slaw. Drinks are also a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Omg .... SO good! Have gone by a million times,  that means a million prior mistakes.  The bloody mary has set a bar for all others to beat (a nearly impossible task). The burger had such flavor!!!! Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"I had the Blue Moon cocktail. It's made with homemade moonshine which was super good. I think I've only had low quality moonshine haha.  For lunch Johnny had the house salad, I had the Kale salad. Both were very good.  I had them split mine so now I have lunch for tomorrow.  Then we split the lunch express with brisket and turkey. Very very good. The Cole slaw was different and good! I highly recommend this place.  Ask for Kerrin he's a great server!!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. I plan to go back to try again because I need to. This little place has a great ambiance, albeit a little dark for the black menu lol. But I get it.. Bootlegger.. Thematic. The decor was awesome, simple and yet full of detail. Menu is pretty limited for the restaurants in the area, which is perfectly fine. Sometimes one doesn't need 50 pages of things to read through to pick. And I suffer from decision making skills because I want everything. We ordered two cocktails and while my hubby and I are not drinkers we do like to sample the goods and this plane was voted best moonshine so... When in Rome. My husband has a somewhat dainty palate when it comes to drinks.. Which is hilarious if you saw him. He got the Hazzard Count Peach Tea... And he looked confused after his first sip. Well he thought they forgot the alcohol. So I took a sip. No. No they did not. Definately there, but dang good. So winning on cocktails. No appetizer for us however going back I would get the bacon sampler. Hubby got the snitch burger and I got the Philly sandwich. With the sweet potato fries. OK so. Hubs burger was quite possibly one of the best tasting burgers I've ever had.. And I've eaten burgers all over. Each item on it was discernable, delicious, and just flowed. It was beautiful. His fries were amazing. Now my sweet potato fries were fabulous. The maple dipping sauce they have is  drinkable. I want to put it on everything. So good, even my picky husband who won't put a sweet potato fry near his mouth in normal circumstances are one and liked it. Then he hijacked my sauce for his own devices. My sandwich I must say didn't work for me. It was just too greasy and where my husband food has individual tastes to each item, all the of mine kinda just were the same. The cheese misfit melted off the side and nothing really held its own. The meat was good. But it just left me wanting more. Not more did, just more awesomeness. But like I said it has enticed me to return and I will because everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and drinks. Deviled eggs and pork belly tacos were to die for.  I had a spiritual moment when I ate the boot bacon bomb.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"A serious disappointment! I tried a few samples  at the Scottsdale Farmers market and seemed good enough. Then decided to go to the restaurant, wow can't express how terrible for a high priced bbq joint. Went there on a Thursday night, ordered the bbq sampler platter- the cold slaw was basically plain cut up cabbage with maybe some salt. The side of corn, we couldn't even finish, was rock hard and had terrible flavor. My 10 year old niece can BBQ's better corn with her dad back home ! Now for the meat, hmmmm, I think the reason why this place keeps getting 4 or more stars is because the people that go have yet to try truly good BBQ.  The terrible service didn't help either. I will never go back. I gave it two stars just because the atmosphere was nice by the fire ."}
{"text":"Excellent barbeque!   Had the lunch express combo with brisket, pulled pork, tortillas and cole slaw for$15.  Perfectly prepared meat, moist and flavorful.  Plenty of food, left with some for dinner. Great service.  Only complaint...music too loud to talk."}
{"text":"Bruh... this place has an appetizer that is nothing but BACON! .... Drops the mic........ Comes back to the stage.. Kyle I am gonna let you finish but Bootleggers has the manliest menu of all time!!!  No joke this smokehouse is legit! Their Bootlegger burger is ridiculous and a must have! Not to mention the Sunday Funday deal where you get a giant bloody mary which comes garnished with an F'n slider on top of it, oh and also a side car of beer for $15. Yeah its a good way to say hello to the day! Oh the the apple-pie moonshine they make in house... forget about it.. smash like 10 of them and see where your day goes. This is one of those places in Old Town more people need to go. Its the business for sure."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, heard great things about this place, got there place looked cool.  Started out with them being out of the brisket, and being out of the dumplings. Was not that busy and took awhile for them to realize they didn't have any. When food came out it was cold, very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The drinks were delicious and the service was impeccable.   The flapper was possibly the best drink I have ever had.  Adam treated our party to the best service anyone could ask for. Thanks for making our annual trip to Scottsdale memorable, cheers!"}
{"text":"Nice BBQ place located in Old Town Scottsdale.  We decided to just stop in for a drink because we've eaten too much BBQ when we lived in Dallas...honestly, kind of worn out of it.  The bartenders were nice, the atmosphere was laid back and the drink list was extensive.  If I'm feeling adventurous next time, I will try the moonshine."}
{"text":"Came in for an after dinner drink with another couple and bachelor.  The smell is magical...mmmm mmmm  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were absolutely AMAZING.  I apologize I can't remember your names, but you made our visit great. I had a simple glass of wine but the hubs had your old fashioned and he thought it was great (I did too and those usually aren't my cuppa tea)  You were fast, engaging and I can't wait to come back and enjoy the food! (and cocktails)"}
{"text":"Yuuuuum. Not only are the food and drinks awesome (whatever this champagne moonshine cocktail is, get it), but the service was excellent. I ordered the prime rib and wasn't thrilled (not because it wasn't quality, I'm just not a beef fan - thought I'd try something new but nope), and my waitress could tell I wasn't into it. She replaced my meal with something else, no questions asked. In addition, she brought me a moonshine shot on the house (infused with apple cider, delicious)! Really, if you're in the area go check this place out! Kudos."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ but the one thing you must get no matter what if you come here is the bacon board. The has at least 6 different types of bacon you can sample and every one of them is delicious. I wouldn't make the trip for the BBQ but just might for that bacon board again. Service was better than average."}
{"text":"We had lunch, devil eggs where really good and the lunch express  - brisket And pulled Polk."}
{"text":"They have excellent meats. I also ordered the pork tacos with roasted poblanos, cilantro, onions, delicious. So many more menu items I'd like to try so I'll be back for more. They have a nice thing going here."}
{"text":"The smoked prime rib is a winner.  $25 for 10-12 oz of smoked meat (about 2-3 oz of fat). Delicious and comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe.  Had with a light tasting, smokey Dog Park Dark draft.  Hit the spot.  Would def return to try the other menu options.  Particularly the bacon board with 4 types of bacon!  And a few more of the 20 drafts.  Whoa."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch this week! I had my favorite, the panko chicken sandwich with yummy ham, cheese, arugula, etc.. It's the best sandwich! Buddies ordered the house salad with half a sandwich, and they loved it. Portions are generous and the house made chips are so good. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The brisket was AMAZING!!!  This place has a cool vibe, friendly bartenders (Larry & Berkley were great!!) awesome food & killer apple pie moonshine. MUST try the bacon board!!  We went here twice during our weekend & wish we had gone back a third time!"}
{"text":"Great service!!!!  Thank you Brighton for making our 36th anniversary great!!!  You are amazing!!!!. And the bacon board is pretty darn amazing too!! and my Tito's, soda and cran was perfect!!  And they seem to be the only bar that has \"real\" cranberry juice vs yeck!!!"}
{"text":"I had been to the Bootleggers on Shea many times and love the food.  I'm closer to the Old Town location so I went for the first time last Friday.   I was sooooooo sad that this location doesn't feature the brisket chili.  PLEASE bring it your menu.  I split the BBQ platter w/ a friend, and it was good.  The brisket is the best.  But, please, please, please--  the chili!!  And, if you love a wedge, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We travel all over the country racing bmx and stopped in Phoenix for the winter national race.    The ambiance of the place was pretty cool and fun.   Nice for a date night or just a drop by and eat.   Had to wait quite a while for our appetizer but I assume it was because we ordered the dumplings.  Food was good not great. I got the French dip it was pretty good but way to small to fill a 180lb grown man then to add fries for 3$ more on top of the already 16$ meal over priced for the proportion.   The wife got the brick chicken it was tasty as well but way under proportion as well for 18$.  Definitely could have used twice the veggies to fill the tummy.   The wife's a 120 twig and she left still hungry.  My 9 year old got the full size pulled pork sandwich.  He loved it but he's 9 and shouldn't have been able to finish an adult meal.  We left and went to mc Donald's for Sunday's to top our dinner off.   All in all we wouldn't come back traveling through there again.  For the cost the proportions should be twice the size."}
{"text":"This place has a good drink selection (although it is rarely accurate on the menu). Food is decent and I haven't been disappointed the 4 times I have been. Some sides are better than others but overall it's alright."}
{"text":"Dana was my server tonight, and she was the best thing that ever happened to me.  I am visiting Scottsdale for work and I am going to make it a point to come back here and see her before I leave. I haven't had such great service at any time in recent memory. She made great food and drink recommendations (pulled pork for the win!) and  really made our night amazing. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go to the farmers market near this place almost every weekend, and the smell coming from this place had me really wanting to check it out. We finally got our chance last weekend and absolutely LOVED it.  The waiter was very friendly and attentive, and since it was our first time there, made a few recommendations for us. My wife had a grilled chicken sandwich that she really enjoyed, and I had the salmon BLT which was amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly (and you get a pretty big portion of it) and went well with the sauce and the sourdough bread. We also ordered the cottage fries, which are yukon gold potatoes cut like criss-cut fries. Per the waiter's recommendation we tried a side of their ranch dressing with them - absolutely incredible. I don't know what they do differently from other places, but I would put that stuff on anything.  Definitely looking forward to going back and trying this bacon board I keep hearing about as well as their brisket."}
{"text":"Short rib and homemade moonshine... Amazing. Had our meals and drinks at the bar and the bar tender was very knowledgeable and attentive."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fabulous.  Our waiter was a bit odd, and certainly could have been more friendly, but it in no way ruined the food experience.    We will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Excellent ribs- smoked perfectly and delicious.  Large variety sides- we tried four (mac and cheese, veggies, coleslaw, and fries) and all were tasty (especially the fries!).  Casual environment and very accommodating staff.  Large selection of beer and our server graciously offered bring a sample of beer to assist with our decisions. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and caught the tail end of happy hour. I got a brisket taco and a salmon taco- both were delicious and flavorful. I got some happy hour drink and was super super strong. My mom got ribs and loved them. It took awhile to get our food which is why I gave it 4 stars. Our server, Tami, was really friendly and informative with the menu items. While we were eating here there was a monsoon and the power went out and everyone just stayed and ate by candlelight."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful.  Very well done in terms of decor and ambiance.  The meal was good but not outstanding.  The meat was the best part which should come as no surprise since it is what they are known for.  The server seemed a little distracted and it wasn't even very busy when we went.  I ordered the pork with the homemade tortillas and asked what salad options they had to go with the meal and when I asked it seemed like an outlandish question based on his tone in responding.  I felt the menu was a little overpriced for what you got.  BBQ in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area is a competitive market to jump into and I just feel there are other great options out there.  But if you are looking for a good place to go for the atmosphere this is your BBQ option."}
{"text":"Bootleggers is walking distance from my house, so I was super excited to have a revamped bar  nearby. I've 'been here half dozen times and I hate to say I am not very impressed.  Service is incredibly slow, every single time.  There is clearly no sense of urgency to greet tables. It has taken 15 minutes to get a beer. Even when the server made an error on our tab (overcharging us hundreds of dollars), she didn't seem apologetic at all.   I've had some amazing food (the nachos!) and I've had very average food. The Bootlegger burger is delicious. On the flip size, $32 for three meats and a side of coleslaw is serious overkill.  The pulled pork sandwich and grilled cheese are average. The asparagus and cauliflower sides were awful. They have a great draft beer selection (although they got rid of all 4 I once ordered) and moonshine served from mason jars.   You will easily drop $50 here for dinner for two and one round of drinks. I have brought friends and family here and they often leave disappointed. It may be worth a try, but I doubt I will back for anything but the nachos and burger."}
{"text":"Great place, the smell of smoked meat fills your senses when you walk in. Great decor & the cocktails are to die for!!! Got to try this place!!! Yummy BBQ & Booze!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed everything about this place. Cool theme, great food, unique atmosphere. I had the short ribs and was more than impressed. The other people with me had the chopped kale salad with salmon added. She is a pretty big kale salad fanatic and said this one was one of the best that she has ever had. My dad had the burger and it looked and tasted great. It was very rare which is the way I love it but, my old man probably would have preferred it a little more well done. The only other compliant would have been that they were out of a couple of the beers that they had listed on the menu they were out of one of the appetizers that we had ordered as well. It was a Sunday evening so they probably had a busy weekend."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for the first time & its HOT!!  Julianna is behind the bar & she makes the very best mojito, not too sweet, just like I requested.  So refreshing!  And the brisket nacho flat... if you like smoked Bridget & nachos, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  My wife and I thought the bartenders and waitstaff were prompt and knowledgeable. The food was way smoky and very flavorful. We tried the taco apps, the mussels, the Scottish salmon and the fall off the bone ribs. All excellent!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time last week. We were seated immediately but waited 5-10 minutes to be greeted. I could tell they were busy, and our server was very nice once he came over. I had the smoked turkey sandwich which comes with chips. I'd prefer fries but not for the $3 up charge. It was okay, I'm not a huge fan of barbecue but my boyfriend had the same thing and enjoyed it. A table next to us had the tacos which looked good, so maybe I'll try that if I end up going back."}
{"text":"Wow what an excellent comfortable place!  We sat at the bar & our bartender, John Murphy  knows how to be fun & professional-  We'll be back & sitting at the bar, hoping that John Murphy is working then . Thanks for a wonderful time in Old Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get food and drinks in Old Town. The Sampler for 2 was great for my husband and I. We really enjoyed the turkey and pork. The cocktails were fantastic! I recommend The Old Fashioned with moonshine. Also they have happy hour until 6 daily! Nice place for a date."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night with a group of 9. We grabbed a drink at the bar and waited for a table on the patio. It was a beautiful night and the patio was perfect, tables were spaced well so it wasn't loud at all. The service was excellent. Everyone was very attentive and Jeremy our server was phenomenal; attentive and split all the checks without trouble. Our table shared the bacon board which is quite the presentation. My boyfriend and I shared the BBQ sampler which was awesome! All of the meats were excellent, my favorite was the turkey and the pulled pork. Ambiance was so cute, we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Sorry folks, I was very under whelmed with a burger costing, $14.00 the bootlegger burger, the bacon was not even done on it come on.  Went for lunch on a Tuesday at 11:30, hardy anyone there, so no reason to not do great on food.  I have better high end burgers costing $10-11 range! Oh burger came with chips, how about some fries for that price!!!"}
{"text":"The brisket was amazing!!! I'm also a big fan of the guacamole!! Coming from Texas, this felt a little bit like home!"}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's Day, had an amazing time and the food was amazing! Really enjoyed the bootleg dumplings, corn with a tangy sauce, smoked prime rib with broccolini and goat cheese mashed potatoes (the prime rib just melts in your mouth and you can only get it after 4 pm and they have a limited amount per day), also got the potato chips (forgot what they were called on the menu) and the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Will definitely come back here for sure and our bellies were completely full by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Kenin took complete care of us.  This place was exactly what the doctor ordered.  So many tastes that I was unaware of, and each one was a complete and utterly wonderful surprise."}
{"text":"Went in to have just one drink and I couldn't leave. Larry the bartender was amazing. The cocktails he crafts are not to be missed. I'm so happy I stopped by...looking forward to coming back for dinner - the good looks amazing."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to coming here for some time. So I had a guys night planned with a few friends, I decided that we would go to Bootleggers for dinner. I really liked the vibe of the place and was really excited to there with my friends.   We all enjoyed our meals for the most part. However I felt the service fell a little short. Our waitress simply was unwilling to allow any changes to the sides on the menu. Not that it was a big deal, but her attitude was quite dismissive. Also there should be a way to order a combo plate without having to get a two person shared platter."}
{"text":"In town on business stopped in for lunch. Had the salmon BLT and it was FRIKEN DELICIOUS!!!  I will definitely come here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good but we went at around 8:45pm on a Thursday night and it was empty. Literally empty. We were the only people in the place so that concerned us. Again, I think places close and people go home early around here.   We ordered the Bacon Board (or something like that) and didn't know what to expect. It was one of the best things I've ever eaten. My special lady agreed and she's not a fan of meat (easy on the jokes here!). It came out with various cuts of bacon that were so delicious it left us wanting more. And the crazy part was that none of it was overly salty.    My son ordered the wings and ok, everyone does wings. But these came out crispy with sauce on them and just a very light hint of smoke flavor that wasn't at all overpowering. They were truly unique and interesting, something I would definitely return for.   I ordered the \"Best Chicken Sandwich\" (fried and coated in Panko) and while it was a decent sandwich, it wasn't \"The Best\". The sourdough was charred (it was supposed to be in a grilled sense) but I'm not a fan and there just wasn't anything memorable about it. Like I said, it was decent and I would order it again but not \"The Best\". It is worth a try.   My special lady got the chili pork something tacos (don't remember the exact name) and she loved them. I tried the pork and it was very tender and tasty. She is somewhat picky so for her to say she loved them says a lot.   We also ordered the Mac and Cheese. My son didn't like it because he's stuck on a Mac and Cheese from a place back home but the one at this place was pretty good. It needed a bit more salt for my taste but that's not hard to adjust at the table and it's better to have less than more.   Overall I would definitely return. I can't figure out why this place was empty at this time of night."}
{"text":"Zero stars if it was applicable. Flew into AZ from chicago and read the reviews on this place. My wife and I decided to have dinner here. Our waiter's personality was a little rugged and not what you would usually see in a service environment. I didnt like him. Once the bill came and it was time to pay, I had gave them a gift card with 100 bucks on it that I paid with. Waiter brought the receipt back and I signed off on it and was about to head out the door until the waitress stops me and tells me the card did not go through. This was impossible because I have a receipt indicating that I signed off on it showing 'approved'. She had indicated she had reversed the charge and tried swiping my card again and it declined ( bill was 80 bucks so swiping again on a 100 gift card would not work). I asked for a copy of the reverse charge and it was not provided. They indicated that I had to pay again. I pulled out 80 bucks cash and paid.   Two weeks later, I do not see a reversal on the gift card as the balance is still sitting at 20 bucks. I paid twice for a meal and contacted the manager 'Joe' during the two weeks in which case he swears it was refunded but was not  No proof of returned funds or receipts showing a reversal. His attitude is the worst and I recommend staying away. Total ass wipe."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant but I do have to give a warning if you're someone who doesn't eat meat, you may have a tough time with the menu. It's very dark in this establishment but I think it adds to the atmosphere. I've been here 3 times and each time the wait staff has been pleasant and helpful. Great place for a dinner or lunch with friends!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and fantastic smoked meats! Larry the bartender is very welcoming and makes great cocktails! So worth trying out!"}
{"text":"I had the sampler, the nachos, and some tacos; along with a good amount of moonshine and cocktails, and everything was amazing. They have some of the best brisket I've ever had, and the apple pie moonshine is so smooth and delicious."}
{"text":"So very excited about the addition of this new gem to our neighborhood!  Great atmosphere and very cool decor...but the food...oh my!  Absolutely outstanding!  The nachos are in a class all their own.  The PBLT - that's PB for PORK BELLY, is one sassy sandwich.  Everyone seems to be doing pork belly these days, but not everyone is doing it so well.  This was so, so good!  My favorite, hands down, was the Crispy Rock Shrimp appetizer with cheddar grits, tomatillo sauce, green apple gastrique and tomatillo sauce with the most scrumptious little nuggets of crispy pork belly you could ever hope to taste.  My husband and I both agree that this is one of the best dishes we have ever tasted anywhere.    The bar is also very fun and had some amazing looking concoctions that we'll have to try in the future.  The atmosphere is sexy and rustic, with brick and reclaimed wood and feels like a dark, cool oasis that will be a great spot to escape from the summer heat.  Featuring housemade moonshine in mason jars with all kinds of tempting combos like Apple Pie and Blackberry Peach it may be hard to choose, but I think the one with my name on it the next time will be the Tito's Mojito.  Our little neck of the woods is really taking shape with Bootlegger's joining our other favorites 32 Shea and Sala Thai.   Maybe we'll be the next culinary hub!  That said, even if it wasn't in my backyard, I would frequent this new gem!   Go here.  You need this."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place last night for dinner and I can't say that it held up to all the hype. The decor and atmosphere are great, completely unique for the area since there are very few dining options.   They had run out of pulled pork by 7pm, which was disappointing because it is one of my favorite bbq items. My family and I ordered the meat sampler (minus pulled pork since they had run out) and a a couple of sides. My favorite part of the meal was the Mac and cheese- It was delicious. Probably won't go back unless my family has dinner there again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The wife and I got the brisket platter and salmon tacos w/ sweet tater fries. Ordered the apple pie moonshine which is homemade in house and was wonderful. Will be returns for a second go-round in the near future."}
{"text":"First of all, Robin our server was fantastic! She was friendly, funny, knowledgeable, and didn't steer us wrong on any of her suggestions. My  friend and I just tried this place for the first time because of the bacon board appetizer. It was absolutely delicious. I started with their mojito, which was one of the best I have ever had. my friend tried some if the different moonshine flavors amd the copy cat cocktail. she enjoyed all of her beverage choices. I then had the house smoked turkey open face sandwich and my friend had the crispy chi ken sandwich. We both thoroughly enjoyed our sandwiches. Lastly, we shared the peach and blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream. It was delicious and a great summer dessert."}
{"text":"Overall loved the vibe and great food! The tacos were amazing, especially the salmon and pork belly. I got lucky two other girls got tacos so we all swapped and each of us got a taste of all three salmon, brisket, and pork belly. The brisket is good, but I think after tasting the salmon and pork belly, the flavor was not as satisfying to me as it would be. The mango & cash drink was a great addition to my meal as well!   I would've given a 5 star, but the only thing was the waitress took away one of my friends' plate without asking whether he was done. And no, he was not done, but other than that great place. Definitely a mellow vibe."}
{"text":"Loved the BBQ sampler! My boyfriend and I really love BBQ food and this was delicious. We loved that it came with tortillas (and they were amazing tortillas). I'd definitely come back and have this again :) loved sitting outside in the patio area too! The servers weren't super friendly but otherwise it was great."}
{"text":"Not really worth the money. Got take out and once I got home noticed I only got 1 small container of bbq sauce with my pound of brisket. Was never asked if I would like more. Took out all my food and the mash potatoes looked like a baby scoop. It was $6 for them. Got 4 pieces of broccoli... that was $5. Never got my coleslaw that it said I would get. The ribs tasted good but just over priced for little to not food. Not going back."}
{"text":"Bacon Board was great - truly - one of the best I've had  There's a couple reasons I'm not giving more stars on this one 1.) the fact that I had the pulled pork sandwich and it wasn't even pulled 2.) the lack of quality sauces and finally 3.) Atmosphere is so / so - sit in the bar sections for sure - other room is too cut off from any of the action taking place.   However one of the people in our group said the Brisket was legit and the service was friendly enough - so it's ur call on this one - can't give it a full recommendation but if you do happen to visit make sure to partake in the Bacon Board."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some drinks on a Wednesday afternoon. Great drink and food specials during Happy Hour. Specialty cocktails were all good and smoked wings excellent. Bar tenders were friendly and helpful with info . Manager came over to make sure everything was good, which was a nice touch. Try the Apple pie  Moonshine."}
{"text":"Went for date night, sat at the high tops in the bar area. Great cocktails and draft beer selection. Awesome atmosphere. We had the ribs and prime rib, both were delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was so great !!! We had a awesome server everything was out fast, perfect for us having a little one. The bacon board was tasty. Defiantly will be coming back !!! Uhhh did I also mention the great service !!! I would give 10 stars if I could. Ps loved the apple pie moonshine :)"}
{"text":"Smoked prime rib, always prepared medium rare, quite good.  Beet salad was yummy.  Nice environment,"}
{"text":"We ate before we came since I expected a dive...boy was I wrong.  What a great atmosphere. Rustic and laid back. Menu looked great. Can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"First time in last night for my buddy's birthday.  Decor is amazing with old woods and antique lighting.  Very modern western.   The smoke smell hit me immediately when I walked in the door and mixed right in with the American Mule that I got at the bar.  Bartender was really friendly and chatted it up for a few til my friends arrived.  Hostess and waitstaff were really nice, joking around, and created a laid back atmosphere.  Food was delicious.  Had the bacon platter which I recommend.  Had a variety of bacons (cherry smoked, apple smoked, jalepeno) and a few unique sauces to try with them as well (mustard, cherry, and onion jelly).  Very good flavors and with all the options, lots of combos to try.   Had the half rack of ribs.  They were a little dry, but flavor was excellent and the meat was terrific.  Came right off the bone.  Plenty of meat on them compared to other places where i found it is mostly bone.  Cobbler for dessert was interesting with a cinnamon toast crunch crust.  Wasn't my favorite combo, I like the traditional cobbler crust, but I appreciated its unique approach.   i want to go back and try the pulled pork next."}
{"text":"Barbecue can evoke different emotions from everyone. For me, it's home style, southern deliciousness with plenty of ribs, sticky with a side of sweet potato mash.  With one type of rib offering, I didn't get my sticky ribs I had wanted and settled for home style Mac and cheese & fried green tomatoes.  The barbecue was ok, but the  mac and cheese & fried tomatoes mostly had me feeling like I had gorged myself without any of the deliciousness. Next time I'll have to pass, unless someone is willing to share the bacon board."}
{"text":"30 minutes for a to go order and it's not even that busy and it's a French dip and some nachos. Was told 5 minutes when I arrived waited 25 and left just avoid coming here their order of operations sucks"}
{"text":"today I had the best experience st this business. We were running late for airport...bartender went and personal spoke to chief. Meal came out in less than 10min...and was perfect. I'd say good was a 4 star, buy the attentive, helpful service put it over the top.  Ordered pork belly with shrimp dumplings, Cobb salad with docked turkey and pork belly...both excellent. Other other at table was lunch special of brisket & pulled pork with Coleslaw. Also perfectly cooked. Great choice for excellent lunch."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the brisket and shredded pork, brisket was juicy and had a nice smoke ring.  Looks like they have a nice long happy hour which i'd like to try out soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place recently because my son and my wife have been asking for barbecue. We were pleasantly surprised. Ribs wee very good. Brisket was excellent. Sides were pretty good. Service was pretty good, too. Nice people. But it is a small, loud place, with a large bar area. I see some people have complained about the prices, and I can see their point. But the food is worth it, and I will be back. I just need to figure out how to time my visit to miss the noisiest times."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood feel and friendly staff.  STick with the 'que..."}
{"text":"Everything tasted AHHHHMAZING. We got the chopped brisket, snitch burger, fried Mac n cheese and kids chicken strips. Again the food tasted delicious however it was a bit on the colder side and the chicken strips where VERY crispy (kind of hard) but again tasty."}
{"text":"This restaurant is is a small little strip mall you barely notice it is there but wow once you try the food you will want to come back. Amazing flavor a in their food and great service"}
{"text":"St. Louis ribs, amazing! Apple pie moonshine, fantastic! Red potato mashed, incredible! Brisket sandwich, tender and absolutely delicious! Anthony was an excellent server!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this four and a half stars for the pork belly tacos, which I'm still fantasizing about. Background: had dinner here with friends,and we all did the restaurant week menu, which includes apps (deviled egg drizzled with truffle oil & chili flakes; stuffed piquillo pepper filled with forbidden black rice, corn, cheese; wonton filled w/ pork belly & shrimp, with a mango chipotle sauce drizzled on top). You get all three apps, and then you get 3 tacos of your choice and a dessert. I got two pork belly tacos and one brisket taco. The brisket was great (spicy, with the addition of chipotle cole slaw), but the shining stars of the meal were the pork belly tacos. The meat was crispy on the outside, juicy & tender on the inside, and just outstandingly... porky. The toppings of avocado and pickled onions added just the right acidity and creaminess to balance the crispy richness of the pork. Winner!  Oh, and the desserts were good, too - I liked the Jack Daniel's fudge brownie best, but the peach blueberry cobbler was also tasty."}
{"text":"Experience was ok. Pickled eggs were bland but not bad. Wings were great. Fries were blah. Bootlegger Burger was ok I forgot to order well done so very pink but tasty I just ate around the edges."}
{"text":"Oh, no!!!...we're now experiencing the evolution of a restaurant that was well financed but now the money wants MORE money back.  Over the last couple of years, I've seen the prices rise on all plates and I'm fine with inflation of beef, chicken and pork of 25% as long as portions and quality remain strong while being represented correctly. Unfortunately, they're cutting down on portions to the point that it's downright wrong. First, I began by trying to call in and order a half chicken with two sides as it's advertised in the pick-up menu for 24 bucks....I gave up however after 5 calls going immediately to an answering machine.  I then drove to the restaurant and found out quickly that they no longer offer a half chicken of any type without 24 hours notice.  Wanting some good chicken, I settled on the \"Large Plate\" section of Brick Chicken with potatoes and broccoli.  I was told that it wasn't necessarily going to fill up two people but my wife wanted a bite as she had already grabbed a meal with friends after work.  This \"large plate\" for 20 bucks was ridiculously petite to say the least. I'm so disappointed and hungry!!!  Why Bootleggers...why have you given up so quickly?  Chicken is plentiful...I promise!"}
{"text":"I was on a work trip and randomly found this place. I am so glad that we ate here because it was delicious! We started with the blackberry moonshine cocktail which was awesome. It was served with basil which tasted great. I would have loved to been able to try more of the drinks since they all sounded amazing. We got the short rib, Mac and cheese, and sweet potato fries. The short rib and mac and cheese were so good! I am really picky about Mac and cheese, but this one did not disappoint. The short rib came with a bbq sauce that was on the sweeter side. I have had better sweet potato fries from other places, but they weren't bad. If I lived in the area I would come here all the time! The decor and atmosphere is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Was seated quickly and then totally ignored. The waitress chatted up the neighboring table twice while we were seated.  Not sure if the food is any good. We left after  waiting 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a HUGE group of about 75 ppl. I'm sure we maxed out the capacity of this place but they handled it very well. They did their best to get the drink and food orders. They did forget about the nachos I ordered during happy hour and it was 20 min. until the waiter got around to me again, however, after he leaned of the issue he upgraded me to the full plate of nachos to apologize. I was happy they gave the extra effort. I'll have to go back again when it's not so packed to give a better every-day review."}
{"text":"Took a chef friend of mine from New York here and he loved it.  Everything was seasoned perfectly and the deviled eggs are the best I can recall.  Even the cottage fries which weren't made in house but were still amazing were on point.  Overall it was very impressive.  If you haven't tried it get there.  The nachos are killer, the corn is tasty, and the mac and cheese is worth the calories."}
{"text":"We've seen this restaurant on PBS \" check please\". Everything they said in this review was true. The BBQ meat is excellent. We shared the mixed platter, the brisket was our favorite, followed closely by the pulled pork. The 3 different bbq sauces were a nice touch. The bourbon infused brownie was delish, a little bourbon caramel sauce would have made it even better. Service was excellent and right before we left a 2 men band started to play. Very talented fellas. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The best smokehouse I've ever been to. The pulled pork and brisket was melt in your mouth good. The aromas hit you as soon as you walk in the restaurant and have you salivating for the delicious food that is provided.  Also tried moonshine for the first time, albeit apple pie flavoured, and loved it. The cocktails on the menu are just as good as the food and would consider visiting Bootleggers just for drinks if dinner was off the cards."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant & one of their calling cards is moonshine varieties.  I came for the brisket & pulled pork. This was actually featured on a local show.  We started with an appetizer Nacho Flat.  These are nachos on a small baking sheet covered with chipotle cheddar sauce, chunks of brisket, avocado,cilantro, and jalapeno.  It's closer to any entree in size.  Nice flavors with hint of heat.  The nachos stay crisp to almost the end. They also taste fresh made. It's a deal at $15. We came here in search of bacon board which is five types of bacon but at $24, we were fine here.  After looking over the menu a dozen times, we settled on Bbq sampler for two. This is beef brisket, smoked turkey, pulled pork, hot link (sausage), and 2 ribs.  From 11-4 you can get Bbq express with 2 of the 4 choices.  The turkey was really good and moist.  The hot link was pretty spicy, it seemed mild at first bite but it gets hot quick. Ribs were good but not special. The beef brisket was really good with a nice smoke flavor. The pulled pork is the star of the show. Pork was super most and fell apart trying to move it offer the platter.  They give you 3 sauces, Dr Pepper sauce, spicy bbq, and their house bbq sauce.  The Dr Pepper tastes awesome almost a maple flavor with a mild hint. The cole slaw is fresh made crisp with nice vinegar flavor.  We were unable to finish and had to take some home. We came with intentions of trying the sweet potato fries but waitress told us there was a lot of good coming. The show gave high marks to the Jack Daniels desert.  Next time for sure."}
{"text":"Horrible! Tourist trap. Generous portions of inedible meat, except the cole slaw, which was pretty good. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday night I was itching for some barbeque.  I have not made it over to Bootleggers which is only about one mile from my house.  The menu is extensive with ribs, turkey, brisket, etc.  I am always hesitant to try a new barbeque place in town since I moved here from North Carolina and have had a hard time finding reliable BBQ in town........but it is out there  I had ordered the smoked turkey leg with fries and coleslaw.  It was surprising tasty.   The turkey was slow cooked to perfection and was actually juicy, not dry.  It was spectacular.  I was quite surprised that I was able to have only a turkey leg and sides and be satisfied for dinner, but I was...........  The atmosphere in the restaurant is inviting: rustic, dark and a good place for conversation and privacy.  The staff in attentive and detailed.  A fine addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have to admit that I was skeptical. My 12 yo told me that he'd been to this place with his dad and that he liked the barbecue. Not being a huge barbecue eater, I hesitated but gave in as it was on our way home. It's in a strip mall with not much else going on. But, walking in, I was surprised. It's small but with nice ambience. Lights, candles, and friendly staff greeted us. We were asked about our preference in seating and service was immediate.  Our waiter recommended a $24 bacon platter. Are you kidding me? But again, I caved and the platter on a wooden chopping block was served. It was absolutely beautiful. 5 different varieties of bacon, cornichon, mustard, grilled bread, onion and pepper jam. My kid was in heaven and pounded 80% of it. I had a taste of 4 of the varieties - smoked in house. The jalapeño bacon was my favorite with real kick. After two slices of bacon, I trimmed my order back to a kale salad. It is interesting with a lot of different texture and flavor. My son had a burger and half of it landed in a to-go box.   Throughout our evening our service was spectacular. The waiters were attentive, answered questions, made recommendations and validated us as customers. If I were a big meat eater, no doubt I'd give this place five stars. The dinner for the two of us was also over $50 with no drinks so difficult on a budget."}
{"text":"I work across the street and came over for lunch with co-workers earlier in the week and got the brisket sandwich, it was AMAZING. I went back today and tried the pulled pork sandwich it was equally amazing. My co-work is a big foodie and loves their bacon board.. their whole menu looks pretty wonderful. And moonshine pie  I will have to try soon!"}
{"text":"Pricey but what BBQ isn't? Great friendly service from Alex? the guy knows the menu like the back of his hand, was able to do multiple recommendations and the food was KICK A**! Plus any place that has a bacon board is A-OK in our book! Get the Local Dines ($50 for $25) Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after localdines.com offered a $25 for $50 coupon. We had never been here before and wondered why after eating the food. Really delicious food! We had the following: Nachos: Wow, huge portion! Delicious. Great toppings of cheese, smoked brisket, peppers and avocado. Cobb salad: good salad with lots of low carb items. Bacon board: Amazing. Wow wow wow! Smoked corn on the Cobb- tough, not thoroughly cooked. Peach and blueberry cobbler: wow, really nice. not too sweet, made in house, lots of fruit.  Service was 5/5. Many times, when a place is completely dead during the time between lunch and dinner, the staff will get a little lazy. Not here. Our server, Robin, was quick and efficient, friendly and even took off the corn when it did not meet our expectations. Otherwise, everything was amazing!  We would order everything but the corn again.  Overall my wife give it 5/5 and I give it 5/5. We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"We first sampled their brisket at the farmer's market and really liked it.  I had already been craving BBQ ribs for a while so we ventured over to Bootleggers to give it a try.  We ordered both the ribs and the beef brisket.  The ribs were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  In fact, the last time I had ribs was at a tailgate (made by a friend), which were way better than these.  The brisket, unfortunately, was not good at all.  It was really dry (unlike at the farmer's market) and we had to soak it in the sauce just for flavor and to cover up the dryness.    We had high expectations for this place, but left underwhelmed and letdown."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, exactly what this \"shea-borhood\" needs. There's a large and inviting bar as well as a bunch of seats. The menu is diverse and delicious. I've had the chicken wings and the nacho flat. Some may say this is a BBQ place which is ok too but I believe the other stuff is just as good. The staff is always accommodating and they make a really great drink. They have house cocktails but I always go for a gin and soda or vodka soda, lemon and the pours don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Im with the rest of the folks on here, in the fact that I really can't say enough good things about this place.   It has a modern but rustic atmosphere, that just flows. I guess if I had to complain about anything it would be that the hostess dress was so short I thought it would just roll up at any second and give the restaurant a show. Very unclassy and not appropriate attire.   But, now to the good stuff!   Get the bacon board. Its literally a wooden block with different flavors of bacon. Don't even think about it.Just order it.  The moonshine will also give your body an unpleasant kick in the face, but its good! The martinis were also fantastic. Great happy hour pricing and a really neat place overall.   Would definitely stop by again next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night and it was pretty quiet; exactly what we wanted. I had the beef brisket with coleslaw. The meat was very tender with a great flavor and the coleslaw very light and refreshing. The brisket cuts were a bit heavy on the fat for my taste. Good portion size and great price. I will be back."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting a lot but this place did not deliver. Meat was not falling of the bone, service was just okay and the drinks are weak. The one thing I'll say is all the sides were good and the nachos are delicious!   I'll try it again at some point but was hoping for more."}
{"text":"The wings were awesome! Ok that's the best part of the review. If you wanna continue reading be my guest. So we went in and bought a bunch of items to share to have a sampling of multi items for our palette. The ribs had very little meat on the bone and had tenderness of shoe leather. I have no clue how the pit master ruined there ribs but damn you get the JAMES BEARD award for worst ribs! The short rib was way over sauced and my guess is to disguise the poor cut of meat they were serving. Lady's & Gentlemen  sauce does not mean good when it's BBQ. Generally it means your a poor pit master who needs to apprentice with someone in Texas. Backyard BBQ does not mean your good. And last the chili lack meat content, I expect when I order meat chili it's stocked with meat from an animal.   Let's just say my  experience was not satisfactory and I doubt by the quality of food and extremely high prices they wont stick around Scottsdale much longer. Oh and thanks to the hostess who lied to me when I asked to be seated in the outside patio and was told it was full. Next time don't lie cause I walked by it and there was lots of seating, so you earn the coveted FRANK BOOTH MIDDLE FINGER Award!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Kitchen sink guacamole was so good. Love the pomegranate seeds. Slaw is the best and coming from Tennessee I think I have a palette for slaw. I added the Dr. Pepper sauce to the vrisket. YUM! HIDDEN GEM IN OLDE TOWN."}
{"text":"This is a small dark woodsy old fashioned looking bar that serves Chef Crafted Smokehouse Foods and Hand Crafted Cocktails. I had he Kale Salad topped with added smokehouse chicken. The kale was prepared well and easy to eat. I liked the fresh corn on it and the sweet apricots added a unique touch. I thought the creamy fresh avocados tied it together. I admit I'm sensitive to smoked foods and just don't enjoy half the ones I try. I'm certain that the majority of people would enjoy the chicken as it was fresh and warm but had a certain kind of smoking that isn't for me. But I thought the salad was good.  My husband had the signature PBLT Sandwich (Pork Belly Lettuce & Tomato) that came with house made crispy potato chips. His sandwich differed slightly from the description on the on-line-menu but he thought it was very good as he got it so much so he would love to have it again.  Depending on where you seat yourself you might need a light source to read the menu.   Slight update 12-4-14  I originally rated Bootleggers with 2 stars only because of the ladies bathroom. The bathroom stalls are made with repurposed wood. There are many holes in the wood and a few are large. Maybe I was just paranoid that day but felt very insecure in the ladies restroom and I thought others might feel the same. The owner contacted me and told me the story about the reclaimed wood. It's very old and from his family's barn that he moved all the way here from Montana.  The food and service was good.  Not sure about how I feel about the bathroom."}
{"text":"This place tasted great, looked great, and the staff was friendly. Giving four stars because of how hard it was to get straws for my parties drinks. I asked four people and eventually a bar tender gave me one. They love their straws."}
{"text":"This is the best and unique flavored food ever!   Their ribs are smoked and tender with an incredible bbq sauce.  The beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios is special.  They have a rare cocktail list with unusual ingredients. Their beers are great too.  We loved everything and had to share the ribs because the order was so large but worth it.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Bootleggers in Scottsdale, AZ.   I loved their smoked ribs....no, I fell in love with their ribs.  They were tasty, firm but tender, rubbed with spices and absolutely delicious.   I didn't even need to use the sauce which is unusual for a girl from the Midwest who loves ribs.  When I was told that they had the same quality food on Shea and 33rd Street I was excited to try it because I wouldn't have to fight the traffic through Scotsdale.  Well....don't do it.   Again I ordered the ribs.  This time however the ribs were mushy like they had been sitting around for a day or two. They were smothered in sauce, meat off the bone, and totally not what I had experienced at their other restaurant. I spoke to the waitress several times but she said it must have been a different delivery.  When I got home, I was still troubled so I called them.  When I asked to speak to the manager,it turned out. To be our waitress and she said they are always like that.  So, he next day I contacted the manager of the Scottsdale store to find out why smoked ribs at Shea are soooo very different than the ones at Scottsdale.  He told me he was busy and couldn't talk to me and is hold call again. He didn't ask my name, take my number,or even care.  So much for recommending Bootleggers.  The Scottsdale place also ace a big mistake when I had been there by pouring in their boozed up peaches (called Moonshine) into the peach cobbler.  It was horrible and inedible. They figured out that they had poured the wrong bottle into the mix.  Now, thinking about it,I wonder what else they can mess up in the kitchen.   Beware."}
{"text":"The Wedge Salad, Beef Brisket, Sweet Potato Fries and Coleslaw were awesome.   The waitstaff was great but our waitress asked us so many times how things were that it boarders on awkward.   The chairs on the patio are very uncomfortable, maybe that is on purpose so you will not overstay your table? I would ask to be seated in the comfy looking booths next time.  Had to use the bathroom right after I ordered and one of the two toilets was overflowing and full of crap, kinda put a damper on the dining experience. It was a Friday night and they were a little busy so I will give a pass on that. I would try it again when in the mood for some great barbecue."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken a picture of the turkey leg I ordered. It was the size of a small child. Soft, tender, flavorful, it was delish. Two people got the St Louis ribs and throughly enjoyed them. A couple of notes, it's a BBQ restaurant, serve BBQ sauce with the food, I shouldn't have to ask for it. The cauliflower \"steak\" was chopped and served in a bowl, that's not a steak. The cauliflower purée was fantastic and should be served with a spoon, it's impossible to eat with a fork All in all, very good food and I will return. Comfortable atmosphere and excellent service and sexy lighting! oh yeah, the Old Fashion was pretty good too!!!"}
{"text":"After trying to decide on a barbecue place to take the hubby for Fathers Day, we decided on Bootleggers, based on other reviews. Wow, what a GREAT choice!  We made a reservation for 11:30am, and got there a little early and were seated right away. We sat in a nice booth in the bar area so we could partake in Sunday happy hour. We started off with two delicious Bloody Mary's and the Boot Dumplings. The Bloody Mary's were perfectly concocted and the dumplings were delicious! I wish they came with four instead of three since there are four of us, but we made the kids share one and it was fine. The flavors were delicious!  Our waiter, who was also the bartender, was probably one of the best servers we have ever had. He paid attention to not only us but the kids, and knew what they would like before we even had to ask (olives so they didn't eat ours from our drinks, spoons for their Mac n Cheese because kids love spoons, etc). He even had them remake their Mac n cheese before bringing it out to them because he didn't like how it looked. When it came out it was clearly homemade and perfect.   I got three different tacos (the brisket was my favorite) and the hubby got the brisket dish. We both ate it all and the kids devoured the Mac n cheese (which never happens when we eat out).  As a parting gift the bartender gave my hubby and I each a sample shot of the Moonshine Apple Pie, which tasted just like Apple pie in a glass. Yummy!  We will absolutely be going back again! Next time maybe the two of us so we can sample more of the moonshine ;)"}
{"text":"I've lived in Scottsdale my whole life and I never knew what bootleggers was until I decided to walk around old town and explore. I happened to walk past bootleggers and it sparked my curiosity so I made sure to make dinner plans with a friend for the following week.  Our experience there was incredible!! The food was amazing, the ambiance was perfect, and our server Kailey was the most darling thing!! She was so funny and warm and really made us feel welcomed. She is truly an asset to the restaurant and I will definitely be coming back and requesting her!!"}
{"text":"I still have yet to eat here, I'll do that soon. But know this...this moonshine is something you need to give full attention and respect to. It's delicious...delicious"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here a couple months ago.  I understand the place is fairly new, but the server was not 100% knowledgeable about some of the items like the drinks for example.  This could be because she was not of age, but my boyfriend ended up getting two recommended drinks that tasted nothing like she described.  She was a very attentive and nice server, however.  I ordered some sort of open turkey bacon sandwich with home-made potato chips.  It was very delicious.  The bacon was incredibly smoky.  It was almost too smoky, but the portion was huge so I can see how that flavor would just be too overpowering for an entire meal.  The ambiance was a little strange; it was very dimly lit (to the point it was hard to see, and I am only 22), and there were a bunch of TVs that were playing sports games.  It would have been more romantic except for the TVs.  The TVs really should have only been at the bar.  It was pretty pricey, but it was worth it for the experience of different drinks and food.  Bootleggers does not belong in the strange strip mall-ish area it is in.  I hope the location does not hurt business because it seems it would not be a nice restaurant from the outside."}
{"text":"Wowzers!! Hubby and I were visiting family in Arizona and stopped by a local Farmer's   Market. After tasting an amazing sampler from the Bootlegger's Modern American Smokehouse...we were intrigued. So, we skipped the rest of the market and headed in for lunch. Amazing service, incredible food, good price...trifecta! Our server (forgot name, sorry) was new but every question we asked he found the answer for us. We ordered a combo plate of brisket and sausage. The brisket was tender and delicious, the sausage was amazing with a little too much sauce. The Mac n' cheese was fantastic! It had a a great flavor and smooth taste. I had the pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw...YUMMERS! I cannot say enough great things about the service and the food. If you pass this place up, you will regret it. :)"}
{"text":"Bootleggers gets 5 stars for their amazing, talented and extremely affable bartender Larry. He made the night great fun for our party of 4.  We had both the pulled pork and brisket tacos, both were excellent. The mac & cheese was also delicious, creamy and tasty without being mushy (it's amazing how many restaurants serve tasteless, mushy mac & cheese).  Larry made the best jalapeño drink for me, I don't remember the name, but it's now one of my favorite drinks.  I will be back for the good food, but more for the excellent service and drinks from Larry."}
{"text":"My fourth visit to this establishment in Old Town Scottsdale, this time during spring-training weekend.  The BBQ is consistently good and is smoked on-site.  We had the smoked prime rib and St. Louis Rib/Brisket combo, however they were unfortunately out of hot-links that night .. (one other wish is that they had tri-tip and baby-backs but not currently offered).  Outrageous mac and cheese side.  Fine starters including deviled eggs and pork belly/shrimp dumplings.  My only other minor ding is that they didn't have tabasco or equivalent (should have brought a few of my tabasco-minis which I always pack for trips but didn't think I would need here), must be all the retired snowbirds that can't handle some spice .. Folks: I've eaten BBQ all over the country and always needs the option of some zing at the diner's preference : )  Excellent cocktails including moonshine-based.  They accommodated a special table request even though they were busy, and the servers were very professional and there when you needed them, and not when you didn't."}
{"text":"I gotta say the place has a nice feel to it, the food fell short from expectation though, it's pricey for the portion you get, we first got the brisket and it came in at room temperature and a bit fatty,  the service was friendly and courteous and the manager went out her way to make us happy so she suggested the chicken instead although the wait was lengthy it was good but for the money we paid for it was way overpriced.. French meal portion.. :/ not ur typical BBQ spot if that's what ur craving.."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Great service, incredible food, moonshine, and live music on weekends. All in a comfortable and relaxing environment. One of my favorite places to take out of town guests."}
{"text":"If I could give them more stars I would. This place is amazing. We walked in and didn't have anyone come up to us for about five minutes. Finally a waitress came over and was very apologetic and took our orders right away. She came back and said that they would be giving us a complimentary dessert and rushing our food. The food came out after about seven minutes. It was delicious! I had the Sunday prime rib which was cooked perfectly and was not too smoky. My boyfriend had the short ribs which were fantastic! The bbq sauce was perfect and the portion was huge! The Mac and cheese was also just right. Probably the best short ribs I've ever had. The waitress came back and took our plates and brought out the peach and blueberry cobbler which was very good. When she brought us our check she said they were taking 50% off our bill! We will definitely be back again and again. Our new favorite restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We picked up a bootlegger burger to go and it was Amazing. One of the better burgers I have had in town. Seems to be a fun place to watch a game, grab a drink, and get your grub on."}
{"text":"Thank you for the complimentary apple pie moonshine! Service was quick, affordable, and delicious. Job well done!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was so nice. John was very knowledgeable. We started off with the sriracha wings were amazing! For my entree I had the chicken and it was great too; it was flavorful. The Mac and cheese was good as well. Overall I really enjoyed my meal and would come back."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork and I gotta say that I was positively suprised, large portions, nice taste and nice interior... So if you like BBQ this is well worth a visit and notably attractive pricing"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Bootleggers I am amazed at how good the food is!! Definitely recommend the bacon board with some apple pie moonshine. The bacon board has 5 types of bacon on it and comes with 3 different dips and bread. The apple pie moonshine tastes and smells just like apple pie! The BBQ Sampler is also a must try, at least your first time. You get to taste a little bit of everything.  Other items that I've tried Hickman deviled eggs - I don't usually like deviled eggs, but these were so good! Pork belly and brisket tacos - good, but they're soft shell tacos and this is a BBQ place so you want to try the BBQ! Prime beef brisket - it comes with freshly made tortillas and if you love brisket, you have to taste this! Mac n cheese - best side to go with the BBQ sampler Grilled cauliflower steak - if you love cauliflower, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Parking for this place on a weekend night is no easy task and the service is super slow but it's a good BBQ place. Casual and very affordable. Kind of loud so don't go here intending to have any real serious conversations."}
{"text":"We've never been to this restaurant before, had a server named Brandice and she was absolutely amazing!!! She is the most friendly and outgoing person!!  Make sure to come here and ask for her!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Brandiss!! She made the experience to die for. We decided to try this establishment as we have never been before. From the moment we sat down Brandiss was there to greet us and sympathize with our traffic experience due to the recent highway maintenances. But all was at ease and nothing but smiles with Brandiss taking care of us.  We ordered the dumplings to start and they were great! These triangles of heaven were a perfect blend of the shrimp and pork belly. The accompanying sauces of mango chipotle and sugar beet sauce while not amazing separately was amazing when combined! I highly recommend to the chef zig zagging them together on the board on which they are served. All I could say is.. Please sir may I have some more?!  We also began with a Boot 75 cocktail and a flight of in-house freshly made moonshine. We tried them all: (in order of tastiness) peach, apple pie, orange, blackberry, strawberry and sadly to our dismay the mango was last. It did not taste or smell like anything. Too bad. But the others mainly the peach and apple pie took the spot light on this table of drink :)  We then moved on to a side of their fries and since we could not decide we did an order of half sweet potato fries and half cottage fries. Let me just tell you that I am soooo happy we did. They are both great and I am a lady who loves options! The cottage fries slightly outweighs the sweet potatoes solely due to the spiced rub on them. Genius!!  Finally we got to the main course: we split the bbq plate sampler for 2 and the chicken. I am so happy!! The 3 different sauces that accompany the meats are amazing: sweet, reg and spicy!! The brisket was to die for as Brandiss suggested to us earlier. I did not even have to chew it was so tender! The pulled pork was a tad dry but when smothered in sauce on the tortilla was incredible! The chicken was moist but lacking a bit of flavor. Also, the apple brandy shandy was a great cocktail to pair with our food!  We made it through too! No food left on the plates (at least the meats). I have to say that our server, Brandiss was the type to know when to give us the space to talk and eat and when to come over and shoot the breeze with us and joke and recommend items. She was fabulous and even if the food was subpar (which it is not by any means) we would still come back as long as she was working!  Cheers to the chef at Bootleggers!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"When I visited Bootleggers for the first time, they were short-staffed with just one bartender and one server. We had a drink at the bar while we waited for them to catch up on some tables. The service was great both at the bar...where we were offered our first round on the house (totally unnecessary - we felt terrible for the guys!)...and in the dining room. I had the ribs and they were absolutely delicious - everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals.  Despite being short-staffed, everyone made the best of a bad situation and we appreciated the wonderful food and service. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My first time having proper smoked brisket. Been watching so many tv shows on bbq, and arriving in Phoenix I came straight to Bootleggers from the airport. And was happy I picked a great place."}
{"text":"24 of us headed out to Old Town for bbq eatin'. As you can see from the picture, I think we ordered everything on the menu! Service was very good food was varied and overall tasty.  Excellent place for large groups that aren't out looking for the most fanciest restaurant in town, but for a good time and a good taste of the south."}
{"text":"Oh goodness, a dinner that included moonshine and a bacon board. A board that included five different types of really tasty bacon. Service was slow but good. Food came out fast which is a positive and negative if your table is small. Paleo heaven with tons of meat and veggies - excellent asparagus and green beans. Make reservations and try the Apple Pie Moonshine!"}
{"text":"This is truly as good as it gets, folks. The BBQ is legit. Let's get to the details:  The food: We've been here twice. The first time for lunch we had the Two Meat (Brisket and Pulled Pork) and I had the Brisket Sandwich with Mac n Cheese. The brisket is fatty, seasoned and melty. It's Texas perfection and I'm a native Texan- this is the real deal. The Mac N Cheese, get this, does not require salt or pepper. It's got a crunchy topping, a rich cheese sauce and firm noodles. No truffle-parm crap required.  For dinner the second time hubby ordered the full rack of ribs and I had the brisket entree. We ordered Sweet Potato Fries with Maple Aioli and (again) the Mac n Cheese. The Maple Aioli was utterly delicious. It was the perfect complement to some great Sweet Potato Fries. The brisket, again, was incredible! The coleslaw that came with both entrees was actually very good. The dinners are served with tortillas and I made a little brisket taco. Damn that was good. Are you sensing the pattern?  The Drinks: Oh-my-sweet-heaven-in-a-mason-jar. At lunch I sampled their Flapper moonshine cocktail. It was strawberry sweetness with a nice mild kick. Very nice. And the server was so very  sweet and brought us a sample of their Apple Pie Moonshine and that brings us to... For dinner I had an Apple Brandy Shandy. It's their Apple Pie Moonshine with apple brandy, cider, rosemary, and lime. It's incredibly good. You remember the smell of apple-cinnamon potpourri your mom used to make on the stove? This Shine is how I imagine all that heavenly potpourri tastes were it edible. Thankfully, this stuff is and I would chug it by the gallon-full if my liver could withstand it, and if my pocketbook could stand the Uber fee back to the West Valley. It's better than any moonshine I've ever tasted. Hell, it's better than any cocktail, beer and (with one exception) wine I've tasted. Get it, you won't ever regret it.  The Service: Is impeccable and the icing on this delicious cake. You won't be disappointed I promise."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent.  If you really want true smoked BBQ this is the place for you.  The beer selection is great and the flavored moonshine is killer good!"}
{"text":"The Boot Bomb that is not on the menu is an absolute must have! Simply unbelievable......the ribs were awesome as well, the went well with moon-shine trio sampler!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Must try the bacon board! Have the apple pie moonshine \"Larry style\""}
{"text":"My sister and our two 15 year olds had a great time! The food was excellent! The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing. We did make reservations with open table and had no problem getting in. They took us right to our table without a wait!  The server was a sweetie and was prompt with our drinks and food. She also recommended 2 of the entrees and she was \"right on\" they were delicious! The smoked turkey was my favorite! If your looking for something different \"American Style\" this is the place! Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Heard the burger was great and had to try it.  I did not leave disappointed it.  Everything was great.  I especially loved the dijonnaise."}
{"text":"This is our new spot in Scottsdale. The service was great. It was a casual/romantic setting. The meat in the brisket tacos was perfect, and full of flavor. The macaroni and cheese was the best I've ever had. The pricing was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Wow I was shocked st how good the food was. The in house BBQ sauce was superb and the pricing was lower then expected and service was awesome.  Dickies who????  I'll drive 30min to this place then get Dickies that's 5min away"}
{"text":"A great BBQ joint! Friendly staff, a large menu of choices, tasty cocktails. The food is fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere is rustic and fun. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Plates of bacon and moonshine. Enough said. If you are a meat lover, you will love this place."}
{"text":"Well if you're looking for an overpriced bbq restaurant with small portions you've come to the right place. I came here with my friend and we ordered the bbq sampler for 2 at $32. It would have been a hearty meal for one with a decent amount of leftovers but for two people it left much to be desired. The brisket and pulled pork were delicious, as were the tortillas it was served with but I'm pretty sure fries aren't supposed to be spicy, I'm also not sure why it cost me $2 extra to substitute the side order of coleslaw with fries when they cost the same on the menu."}
{"text":"We had sampled a bit of Bootleggers food a few times at Old Town Farmers Market, but finally made it to the restaurant.    The good:  Fried green tomatoes.  I'm putting these on the good list, although they needed a little salt, either in the batter or just out of the fryer.  But overall, we both enjoyed them.  The remoulade aoili was really good and spicy!  Smoked turkey leg.  My husband ordered this (so that I could order the pulled pork), and while I normally don't delight in a giant leg of any species, this was good, even to me.  My husband left nothing but a bone.  Smoked sweet corn on the cob.  Had a buttery hot sauce of sorts that I loved.    The not so good:  Pulled pork.  I prefer a less seasoned pork, so that the flavor of the meat stands on its own.  I'm not sure if this was very lightly sauced or just heavily seasoned, but it tasted good even though it was not my preference.  The problem was that although there were no chunks of fat and it was trimmed well, it was way too greasy.  I was glad I didn't get a sandwich.  Mac & cheese. Four cheeses, and good flavor but they used a rotini pasta and just overcooked it enough, so that it fell apart.   Cole slaw.  Advertised as \"not creamy, not vinegary, just right.\"  They got two out of three.  The only thing I can say is that it did not seem to be dressed at all.  Just dry cabbage.  My husband commented the same.  I don't like a cole slaw swimming in dressing, but there's got to be something whether it's mayo based or vinegar!  Red sangria.  I liked this, but even after finishing it, I had nearly an entire glass of ice.  You kind of don't get your money's worth on this.  The restaurant was pretty warm inside, so I don't think I would return until the cooler months, but I would definitely come back for at least drinks and appetizers, though maybe not for dinner.  But if some of the \"not so good\" things were fixed, it would be 4-stars for me.  It seemed like the issues I had were more minor execution problems."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I went here for dinner on a rare date night, and Bootleggers left a bad taste in our mouth. When we arrived, there was no one to seat us, although their was a sign indicating we needed to wait to be seated. Once seated, our waitress came and took our order for drinks and appetizers, but then didn't return until at least 15 mins later. When we did order, our waitress never asked if we wanted more to drink and we had to flag her down to even get her to put in the order.   When the food came, my order was all wrong, and I had to get a busboy to fix my order, as out waitress never came to check to see how we were doing. She never came back to refill our glasses, even though the water pitchers were right near our table. Luckily the pitchers did have water in them as we went and personally refilled our glasses.  I could understand the poor service if the restaurant was busy, but there were maybe five other tables that had people at them and the waitress for those tables came back multiple times to check on those guests.   The food itself was quite good, but with the service as awful as we experienced, we do not anticipate on making a return visit."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfying,  water glass had lipstick,  not mine.ordered their sampler to share for 4. While the restaurant wasn't crowded, our food came and was all cold. No coleslaw as it said on the menu. The corn side dish for $7 was about a third of an ear of corn.  While Guy Fieri seemed to enjoy his visit,, the lack luster service, very dark lighting and mediocre cocktail made it so it doesn't have my recommendation."}
{"text":"I'm a bit partial because it's a great neighborhood spot, but I love a comfortable evening out at Bootleggers. I'm no BBQ expert, but I like Bootleggers because of the environment, friendly service and above average food. Oh and the apple pie moonshine! I am super bummed they recently removed the Rock Shrimp appetizer with cheddar grits which was a genius recommendation from a server a few visits back, but there are many other items I've enjoyed and still want to try on the menu. I even think their salads are great. The other day we tried a few of the new items - brisket tacos and dumplings - which were both amazing additions. It was nice to see some small plates added to more heartier dishes for variety. Great to see some positive changes in the last month or so. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I never give five stars for any restaurant - four is the highest  tonight I have the beef brisket with the coleslaw   the problem with the coleslaw is that there were onions in it. however onions are not a traditional ingredient in coleslaw and made them taste terrible  Additionally the beef brisket was a little dry it was slightly overcooked that is very easy to do with beef brisket   I must say though that the mac and cheese that I got as a side order really saved my meal because it was delicious in every way not wet and Soggy and not super dry either just the right consistency and the macaroni was Al Dente  My beer was the vanilla and orange flavored wheat Deschutes. Nice flavor to this beer without being overbearing  I must also say that the view from my seat at the bar...was amazing! In other words my waitress  was cute  - very cute"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere a lot but the food needed a lot of work. I realize it's difficult to serve fresh bbq sometimes, but the brisket was dry and so tough you needed a knife to cut it. The pork was a out the same. For the price and quality of food its a tough sell."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday celebration, I dont even know where to begin. Yes, the bacon board is the tits; other than that this place can seriously S a D. The service was terrible (and by this I mean the server; the bussers were attentive) the drinks overpriced and not even good. The list can actually go on as to how much this place sucked and how I will never come back here. Its actually quite unfortunate because their patio is really nice, somewhere a good meal would be greatly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Great food and drink.  Try the bacon board.  Service is a little off.....slow and slightly aloof.  Definitely worth trying though.  Amazing pulled pork."}
{"text":"Old Town Scottsdale doesn't really scream \"smokehouse,\" with all its chic nightclubs and modern eateries. But a barbecue restaurant makes perfect sense in the historic area, and if you're going to do a smokehouse, it may as well be one with flattering lighting, hip décor and an attractive waitstaff - like Bootleggers in Old Town, where Praying Monk used to take up residence.  This is the second Arizona location for the restaurant, which boasts a \"sophisticated country-cozy\" feel characterized by brick walls and high wood beam ceilings. It definitely felt rustic yet modern, a great barbecue joint that still manages to be classy.  I went there for a preview dinner this past weekend with some friends, and we were treated to a variety of dishes. Be sure to try some of the house-made apple pie moonshine ($5), which comes in a mason jar and tastes so sweetly like the real stuff, you'll swear there's not alcohol in it.  My pal tried a moonshine flight, which included flavors of strawberry, blueberry and peach, and she said the apple pie was by far her favorite kind.  First, we noshed on brisket-topped nachos ($12), with jalapenos and a fresh avocado relish. My pals liked the appetizer, which seemed to be a hit at other tables, too.  Next up was a chopped brisket sandwich ($12), which was served with potato chips. Be careful if you try cutting the sandwich - it might be easier to eat this bad boy all at once, since slicing it caused the contents to spill out. The brisket on this sandwich was the most impressive offering of the night to my friend.  We also were served smoked turkey breast ($8) with coleslaw ($4), which also came with some tortillas to build your own wrap. While one of my pals did not like the sweet taste of the turkey sauce, the other thought it was great. If a sweet flavor on meat isn't your cup of tea, skip this dish. My pal also remarked the coleslaw wasn't distinguishable from the kind you'd get at a fast food spot.  I loved the smoked sweet corn ($4), topped with a tabasco-lime butter. Don't even attempt to eat the corn with a fork and knife - this appetizer is worth getting your hands dirty and tasted super-fresh.  While I'm not the hugest fan of barbecue (and am vegetarian), I would go back to Bootleggers for some moonshine in the giant bar area, which takes up half the restaurant. There are plenty of TVs to catch a sports game, and their daily happy hour menu from 3-6 p.m. includes $3 Coors Lights."}
{"text":"I usually get their meats at their farmers market stand.  In past years, the moist beef brisket was very good.  This is the first time I tried it this year and it was way overcooked.  Way too dry.  Hard and stiff for moist beef brisket at $18.00/lb.  The pork belly was the same.  I bought a pound.  Tasted more like cardboard than food.  Had to throw most of it away.  I've gotten way better food at almost any other place.  What I did eat, it made me feel tired for the rest of the day.  Nice energy sucker.  Quality has went down."}
{"text":"Only drink the moonshine if you are ready for a serious kick! Woah! Now I know why they made that during prohibition. We started the dinner with a flight of moonshine and our palettes were immediately cleansed for a meal! It's really fun to order though, so you should do it.  I really enjoy this restaurant. I like the location, the atmosphere and especially the food and cocktail selection!   I will start with the cocktails. Besides the moonshine, they have an extensive craft cocktail menu and every drink that I've tried is delicious. I especially like the Uptown Fiz with Leopold's gin, fresh squeezed lemon juice, Arizona honey syrup, egg white, walnut bitters and rosemary. It's a refreshing cocktail and perfect for the hot summer weather.   As for the food, Bootleggers certainly knows how to whip up some extremely tasty BBQ. To start, the crispy rock shrimp and cheddar grits is an amazing appetizer. I gobbled up several bites and could have eaten the whole dish all by myself! The grits were an interesting twist to basic rock shrimp and the rock shrimp had a BBQ twist. I have also enjoyed the bacon board during a visit and really liked it! Only get it if you like bacon (obviously!) but if you do like bacon then this board is for you! They have every type on this board and it's accompanied with pickles, mustard and toasts. For my entree, I have enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich and love, love, loved it. The flavor of the meat was smoky and sweet and the whole sandwich was too good not to consume quickly. I'm by no means a BBQ connoisseur but I can say that this BBQ stands out from many other spots in the Valley.   Call ahead and make a reservation, especially if you plan on eating there on a weekend evening during spring."}
{"text":"I may have had to best burger ever here. I ordered the classic burger with cottage fries which were also amazing. They had a nice atmosphere with clean and nice bathrooms."}
{"text":"First all Service was amazing!! Drinks were great. The BBQ not much flavor. Dull for a BBQ. MAY TRY AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ place! My waiters name was Alex and he was excellent! He told us about the place! The food: Very excellent Alex told us how they get there early and start smoking the meat. You can taste the smokiness! Overall one of the best BBQ places in the valley."}
{"text":"Pleasant greeting and good service and beer selection. Cool atmosphere but I would turn the lights up a bit so that you can read the menu.  Appetizer was good and the Bbq sampler was perfect for my wife and I.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great BBQ! However, They have disappointing portions on their sides and the meat on their sliders."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to dinning at Bootleggers as I've heard nothing but good things about their food so we decided to head over a few weeks ago for dinner. There was 3 of us dinning this night so it was nice to get another person's thoughts as well.  My boyfriend and I decided to split the burger (cooked med) and share a larger side of the mac and cheese. Our friend got the bbq pork sandwich and a small side of mac and cheese. We waited about 25/30 minutes for our food but to our surprise only our burger and bbq sandwiches came out...with homemade chips on the side....Ok...where was our mac and cheese. I guess they forgot to make it so they were making it now but wanted to bring out the burger and sandwich so we could start eating. The chips were very good so it tied me over...our burger...cooked well...UGH and the bbq was nothing to write home about. While eating I noticed that several other tables ordered mac and cheese as well and they all got theirs but not us yet...There were only 5 tables that had people at them so it wasn't crowded by any means. We had finished our entire meal and still waited over 20 minutes for the mac and cheese which was a bit of a let down. The server was very good at letting us know that it was coming and she was sorry for the delay (as it wasn't her fault the kitchen took so long) so I don't fault her at all.   The did comp the mac and cheese off our the bill so that was a nice gesture but I was really disappointed with pretty much everything. I had such high hopes for the place. I don't think I'll be back as I really have had better food."}
{"text":"First timer at bootleggers, the bartender John Murphy was AWESOME! Gave us great knowledge on their moonshine infused in house. We also ordered Moscow mules and he muddled the cucumber for us, he was the best! Definitely a place to check out if you're in old town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This is what a great neighborhood smokehouse, bbq joint, or whatever you want to call it, should be! Quaint, home-like, comfortable and having really good food and drink. A nice, though not extensive, wine selection is enough to please some of us \"winos\". I should mention that they have a great selection of beers on tap and in the bottle, and apparently some great cocktails. My daughter and I scouted the place out just last week as a place to meet family and friends for a dual birthday celebration this weekend. The place is not huge, not cramped, and was able to accommodate 13 of us nicely (we made reservations well ahead of time). When we were scouting, and as it was past lunch-time, we had side dishes. Whipped cauliflower, sweet potato fries, and some fresh made mac n cheese. I am always impressed when a place puts whipped cauliflower on the menu, and this place did not disappoint. Creamy, yet held up and can be eaten with a fork. And I don't even like cauliflower. The sweet potato fries were some of the best I have ever had. I often feel that they are just obligatory to put on a menu, but these are so good! And they come with a maple aioli dip that is perfection. The Mac n cheese is just right. Not too creamy, not to runny, and not from a box. Homemade. 'Nuff said. For our large party tonight, the wait staff was ready. Always there when we needed them, never in the way. There are enough sides and starters for the non-carnivores. As mentioned above, the whipped cauliflower. Also, a very good beet salad. But on to the meats. If you like bacon, get the bacon board. Enough for at least 2 people, it's like a swine-centric charcuterie board. Different spiced bacon, pig belly and pork confeit(sp?) put me in hog heaven (see what I did there). Then my son and I split the sampler platter for 2. Which is more than enough for 3 - unless maybe you skip the bacon board. And so good! I am going back for smoked turkey. And some bacon. Anyway, go to Bootleggers. Support your local restaurants. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11am.  Service was extremely slow.  Diet coke was flat and iced tea was a bit bitter.    Started lunch off with the pickled eggs.  There were only 3 halves of egg in the $6 appetizer.  The appetizer was good, but I wouldnt rush to have it again.  I went with the Bootlegger burger and thought it was decent, but the meat by itself was not flavorful -- the burger relied heavily on the onion and sauce to add flavor.  The pretzel roll bun was very good.   The colliflauer steak was unremarkable, and I would not have it again.  The French dip was lean and smoky -- my husband says he would have that again."}
{"text":"This was our first time for dinner and we weren't disappointed with our meal, environment and staff. The brisket in the tacos or as an entree is awesome."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice and attentive. Beet salad was very good.  Although the brisket was moist, the 8 oz potion was at least 50% fat. Unacceptable ...."}
{"text":"Overall a good place for bbq but it was a little pricey even with the lunch special. Speaking of which, you should definitely get the lunch special. I got the pulled pork (awesome) and the brisket (good). It comes with tortillas and cole slaw, which I never thought of as a good combo for bbq but it was actually really good. I also tried the macaroni( pretty good) and the asparagus (pretty bland)"}
{"text":"Attended a company party here and it was wonderful! Service was excellent and the brisket was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with friends who wanted moonshine. There are several options of specialty moonshine drinks as well as moonshine flights. I ordered a specialty drink, and it was really delicious. Unfortunately I do not remember the name of it. I was with a party of 5, and everyone ordered at least one moonshine drink and/or flight. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, although they were a bit expensive (as expected with mixed drinks).  Our server was really nice, friendly without trying too hard, and attentive without being overbearing. I liked the atmosphere in there as well. I also ordered the brownie dessert to share, but it was not very good. It was pretty dry, and neither of us even wanted to finish it. I would definitely come back, either for more delicious drinks and to try the food!"}
{"text":"The brisket and PBLT were great! We also enjoyed the apple pie moonshine. We were a not huge fan of the potato salad or smashed potatoes. We did the moonshine flight but the best one was the apple Pie moonshine the others weren't worth trying.   Service was great and we loved the atmosphere. We are definitely coming back for the brisket and PBLT."}
{"text":"Love their food....all their food! The bacon board is a must! So is their ridiculous Mac & cheese! The Cobb salad it delish, the pork geeen chili tacos are to die for. The green chili pork sandwich is also yummy. Great hidden gem in a strip mall right off Shea/51"}
{"text":"I am a fan- I think the prices are a bit high for what you get but that is just me... also- tortillas but no corn bread with barbecue?! It is odd. I do like their drinks alot here though."}
{"text":"Had a brisket and veggie taco. Both were good but the brisket was the best. Also had the cauliflower mash. It was ok. My husband had the brisket and smoked corn. He enjoyed it as well. Drinks were good and Kyle and Patty were great waiters. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about our experience here...start to finish, it was 10/10 on all fronts!  I wanted to have a birthday dinner with a bunch of friends, but I made the mistake of waiting until Saturday  morning to make a reservation for Saturday night. woops. Fortunately, Bootleggers was able to accommodate my original request for a group of 10 on the patio--which is gorgeous. I called a few hours later and upped the res to 12...no problemo. As is common with big groups, not everyone RSVP'ed to me and we ended up being a group of 16. Still, they made it work without a hitch or sigh.  Having worked in the industry myself, I know how it can be to serve a big group that grows even bigger, and everyone was talking over each other and going nuts half the time. Our server handled it like a champ!  The food was awesome -- everyone had good things to say about their chosen dishes, including my vegetarian friends who ordered a bunch of the veggie side dishes and really loved them. I personally ordered the wedge with chicken added and it was great. from other plates I tried the pulled pork mac and cheese, burger, cauliflower side, potatoes and probably some other stuff.   All of that being said, the best part of the night was the guy who made my birthday dinner extra special by bringing out a round of apple cinnamon moonshine and a banana bread pudding for me. As we were leaving, we found out he was the owner of the place! Super cool guy. He came out to take a group photo for us and even thought to bring up the lighting on the patio beforehand to make sure we got a good photo. It was really thoughtful of him on both accounts.   We will definitely be back!"}

{"text":"We came in for the second time. Last time I was there with an associate and this time was with the lady and both times Larry (I'm pretty sure that's his name). He was a one man show and made all the difference.   The food was delicious and the hand crafted cocktails were dead on. The experience was fun, delicious and makes me want to make it my goto place now. Good thing I live down the street."}
{"text":"The sides are good here..kale salad and cauliflower steak slice but bbq brisket for 14.00 was only 2 strips, dry and chewy...and no bbq sauce included with my 2 go order. I'm so sad I chose here because I could have gotten a whole steak somewhere else for 14.00"}
{"text":"Bootleggers, I WANTED to love you. I did. And you made me sad face.   First, the meat is amazing. Flavorful and melt in your mouth amazing. But you cannot get a 5 star review based on the virtue of your meat alone, and your spotty service and incomplete meal prove that you think otherwise.   The bartender did not know what kind of beer, IPA specifically, that was even on tap. Dogfishhead IPA...great, which one sir? Very disappointing.  The PBLT, which is described as Pork Belly, Lettuce, and Tomato was absent the Tomato. I was going to mention this to the bartender/server but he NEVER reappeared.  Our uncleared dishes sat on our table for 20 minutes or more while the bartender/server flirted with two chicks sitting at the bar.  I had to get up and ask the hostesses (multiple hostesses, why? You only need one Bootleggers) who were dancing, singing, and folding napkins to get me a box for my remaining food.   All around very disappointing experience, and although your meat is divine, I will not be providing Bootleggers any further business.  Once you get your service straightened out you could be a top notch restaurant."}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood spot. Great drinks and kickass BBQ..... You would never know it's there. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Tasty but overpriced. I have done my share of BBQ and I can assure you that a Hot Link should not cost $17 They did a nice job of converting an old neighborhood bar into something a little classier and original and their BBQ stands up but I can't get over paying $20.00 for 5 strips of brisket and some cheesy mashed potatoes in a strip mall.  Server was kind but too busy to be attentive. A neighboring table had a bacon board with snacks and cheesy bread which people seemed to be enjoying. Might be their signature dish."}
{"text":"Not bad...Im pretty picky about my brisket and I like it much leaner than served here.  The smashed red goat cheese potatoes were pretty good but alittle thin and the grilled cauliflower steak was probably the best overall."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 enjoyed great meals, apple pie moonshine & great wine. Anthony, our server, was the perfect addition to our evening. The prime rib was outstanding. The Kale Salad was the best our friend has ever had. Thank you, Anthony & Bootlegger!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch with family. Interesting menu and waiter was outstanding. I had the beet salad and pulled pork sandwich. The salad was amazing and the pulled pork was good.  I will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Was visiting from san francisco and we happened upon this place after a giants game. Sat at the bar and had terrific drinks, great conversation with Kyle, the bartender there and the \"bacon board\" it was phenomenal! Anyone who loves bacon must try it. I will definitely be back when coming for spring training!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ & very creative cocktails!  We will be back!   We've found our new BBQ place."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Dana is the best host for this feast fit for a king! We started with the bacon board and nachos.... it kicked things off in the most amazing way.  I went with work colleagues and the whole office is still talking about the photos on social media \"DUDE WHERE DID YOU GUYS GO LAST NIGHT\" ... all day I've had to field this question.  Then we ordered some cocktails which were really good and refreshing!  Dana sold us all on the smoked prime rib and it did not disappoint! It was so smoky and tender and the au jus and the horseradish ...perfection!  We capped off the dinner with some apple pie moonshine and it again was amazing.  Thank you all for this great experience!"}
{"text":"I stopped in after reading the raving reviews. One of those places you would never know was there if someone didn't tell you about it or find it on Yelp.  First of ambiance. Wow. Really cool place, gives off a great vibe, very fitting for a BBQ place. Very surprised it was so cool for it being hidden in a little strip mall. Awesome ambiance. Service, super attentive. It is tough to keep my drink full and they did and did it very well. I was impressed.  Ok, let's get down to the food.  Started with the bacon board. Great selection of different bacons. Presentation, wow. Jalapeno bacon which was prepared PERFECTLY, thick, crispy, full of flavor and was my favorite of the bunch. However, I found the exact same flavor I believe from Hormel's Black Label Jalapeno bacon. The rest, I never need to have again. Nothing else stood out. Price for the bacon board is absolutely stupid at $24. It was an experience I would not do again. Was it fun and unique though? Yes, absolutely.  Next was the BBQ sampler for two. And it's enough for two. Portions are quite accurate for two people and two people ONLY. Includes beef brisket, pulled pork, hot link, turkey breast, ribs, cole slaw and I opted for rolls and tortillas.   Rolls and tortillas, I preferred the rolls. Soft, chewy, loved the rolls. Tortillas were on the mark. No butter was provided for the rolls though and there was nothing to dip the rolls into.  Brisket, eh, was ok. I'm not typically a brisket fan. This one did nothing for me.  Hot link, very unique, border line strange. A little heat. Flavorful.  Turkey Breast, was moist, juicy, sadly, for a BBQ sampler, it had no BBQ sauce on it, and it was the best thing in the sampler to me.  Ribs, beef. Not fall off the bone. Bite off the bone.  Finally, the pulled pork. Dry. Way dry. Surprisingly dry even upon arrival and seemed to continue to dry out even more.   The BBQ sampler came with one small plastic container of BBQ sauce. The best thing I can say about the flavor is that it is unique. It was unlike any BBQ sauce I have ever had.  After sampling the provided BBQ sauce I asked if they had any others. And sure enough, they did. They had a Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce and third I forget how they described it. The Dr. Pepper sauce was SWEET. Wow, was it sweet. Then I tried the third sauce. Weird is how I would describe it. It wasn't ketchup, it wasn't BBQ sauce, it wasn't cocktail sauce, it was just WEIRD.  So for $56 + two drinks from the bar pushing the tab over $70, I would say we had less than $20 in actual meats. Disappointed for sure when it came to flavors and portions for the price. I have had much better for a lot less."}
{"text":"I was referred by a friend of mine.  We absolutely had to try the Bacon Board.  Amazing!  Great moonshine, great food.  I loved the ambiance.  We will be returning.  Great place for a nice date or small party."}
{"text":"Service was great. The restaurant was cute. Food not good. We both had \"smoked\"  prime rib. There was no smoker in sight. The meat was tough and fatty. The sides were cold. The music was too loud.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Loved this place when it first opened. What happened?  Changed the menu so they don't offer sandwiches at dinner. Bootlegger burger now has a thick slice of uncooked bacon on it. Kale salad left in big chunks where it used to be julienned. Disappointing. Drink prices have always been too high but I could overlook that for a great place to hangout in the neighborhood. Now I am wondering whether it is worth it to go here when there are better places down the freeway."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is delicious!  The dishes are a little on the spicy side so check with the server if you prefer something mild.  You can't go wrong with any of the cocktails on the menu either.  Great ambience, I'm sure you'll have an excellent time if you pick this place for your next meal out."}
{"text":"We thought we loved this place but......... service was great, but first time getting wings Togo and asked for extra crispy got home they were pink in the middle and was catering to our football crew !! and the joke was don't go to bootleggers for wing !! kinda of a bummr!!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are amazing! I recommend this place!! I had the burger and a margarita and they were excellent! The bartender was fantastic too"}
{"text":"Nothing more than 3 stars. And I'm being generous. Pulled pork sandwich was ok but tough. French Dip was rather dry and fatty Entree salads were good. This is based on a carryout with 5 adults with decent taste in food. Since BBQ places are popping up all over next time we will try somewhere else."}
{"text":"The dumplings are Incredible.  The prime rib French dip delish. Can't wait to go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We had a 7:30pm reservation and didn't eat until after 9:00pm.  Despite having a reservation we had at least a 20 minute wait.  That would have been excusable had the rest of the service gone well; it didn't.  Drinks took forever and after waiting an hour for the food, it showed up cold.  When we asked the server where the food was, she just said, \"it's busy back there\", and offered no apology.  This is not a large restaurant and there were several tables open.    We all ordered barbecue which clearly was cooked way before we got there (I don't say that as a bad thing as I don't have 12+ hours to sit there while the brisket smokes.).  What I don't understand is how it could take so long to serve precooked food.  When we finally got the food, it was cold.  It's too bad because it had good flavor and if they figure out how to serve it hot (and timely), it would be solid food.  Even worse than getting poor service and cold food was the complete lack of acknowledgement from management.  Some stoner-looking dude, presumably the manager/owner, was walking around the floor doing nothing, completely oblivious to the fact that the entire restaurant was upset with the slow service.  I'm forgiving, but an apology is the first step.  They really need to step up their game; they're not playing to an audience that will tolerate awful service for very long."}
{"text":"Great food. I have had the Bootlegger hamburger and their pulled pork sandwich and they are both excellent.  I will be going back to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I have to say the food is amazing.  There was only 1 waiter for the whole restaurant for lunch.  Me and my friend were patient because we knew the situation.  Jason was great and came over and introduced himself.  The atmosphere is great.  I watched Check Please and have to say they were right on.  I tried the apple pie moonshine, WOW, I have never tasted anything so good.  I am going back next week to try the flight.  This is my new go to BBQ great restaurant.  Love it."}
{"text":"Hate to give one star to a place I didn't get to even try the food at, but when you come in to a place with a group of 9 you would think the business would be happy for the potential $ to be made. So let me break this down for you.  We started by calling ahead to see if they had room for us, the girl on the phone was very polite, and we thought we had a winner. My wife, son & I arrived first and waited outside for the rest of our group. Looking at the menu outside we were fairly excited to try the place out.   When the rest of our group arrived we were shown to our table. The interior is nice, fairly rustic, but classy for a bbq place. The hostess gave us menus and then we waited, and waited. We were just about to the getting grumpy phase when the waiter finally showed up. This is when things went south.  He was short, rude and frankly a little brass with us. My wife and I are craft beer lovers and were told there were 20 beers on tap. He said I know them but I'm not going to spout off all of them, what do you like? I responded with a should we get up and take a look? Which he ignored and went on to the next persons drink order.  He finally came back to me and I settled on the first thing that I knew I liked. My wife gave up and asked for water.   However others in our group were a bit annoyed with how snarky he was and suggested we leave, and we did. We went to the Brat Haus had great food, great service & a good time.  Let me state that we weren't a loud group, the place wasn't that busy, and we had no loud children. What kind of restaurant is unhappy to have a large group come in on a slow day, and gives them bad service? I've worked customer service for 25+ years and this was one of the most unprofessional waiters I've ever had.   We love food and trying new places, but this was pretty ridiculous. I love on the restaurants I go to and like. I love telling people about great food and service. This experience just boggles my mind though. I mean we probably would have spent between 200-300 dollars there and this guy blew it."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch.    I had the PAN SEARED SCOTTISH SALMON forbidden rice, shallot vinaigrette, and my companion had the PRIME BEEF BRISKET.   Yummm!   The server asked how I wanted my salmon.   I said I wanted it completely cooked but not over-cooked.   He kept asking me if I wanted it well done or extra well done or whatever.   I DON'T know!    I just want it cooked all the way but not over-cooked.    Yes, I like salmon nigiri if I am having sushi, meaning my salmon will be raw.   Having it seared and raw on the inside, UGHHH!!!  Grosses me out!   Anyway, I digress.  The salmon was cooked and seasoned to perfection.   It wasn't overcooked and was moist.  It was seasoned perfectly.   I don't know what it was seasoned with, but it was a very good combination of spices/herbs.   It sat on a bed of black rice, which had the perfect blend of seasoning as well.   I have no idea why it is called \"forbidden rice.\"   He had the prime beef brisket.   The BBQ sauce was on the side.   I tried the brisket.   It was melt in one's mouth.   Very good and tender.   Served on the side were tortillas, and he ate it like a wrap.   I was not impressed with the BBQ sauce.   I thought that was good but rather ho hum, but, then, what can one do with BBQ sauce -- except ruin it.   It was good.   So that's a plus.   I would go back for the salmon.    I'm not what I would consider a beef eater so perhaps, if there is pork on the menu, I would try that."}
{"text":"This place is beyond excellent! My husband and I came here to try their bacon board and we were so impressed with the ambiance and service. Larry was so great! He even let us try the apple pie moonshine on the house! The wings and shrimp & grits are delish! Don't leave Scottsdale without trying this place! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Gotta say, good barbeque for Arizona. Bartender was extremely helpful and even let is sample the house moonshines."}
{"text":"Their brisket is pretty damned fantastic.  We got the sampler for two - everything else was good too.  Skip the corn though - $5 bucks for a single cob covered in some kinda chipotle mayo that resembles a jack n the box topping..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fun & unique items. Good staff.   For two we ordered the bacon sampler (OMG highly recommend) & the BBQ platter was huge- great for maybe 3 ppl this was too much. Everything was so tender and flavorful but disappointed by the ribs (dried out).   We had the moonshine flight: Apple pie, peach & black berry flavors were good but suuuuper sweet.   We ordered corn but it never came out (luckily bc we were so full) so they took it off of our bill. We are from CA so we come to AZ once a year for a tournament and this is one place we like to stop each time. Will be back next year."}
{"text":"My pulled pork sandwich was great.  They smoke their meat every AM so it's always fresh and tasty.  Bootleggers has one of the best craft beer selections on tap in town."}
{"text":"I am not often inspired to write a review but last nights experience should be shared. We arrived about 7:15pm and sat down for a BBQ feast. We were served drinks and placed our order with the bartender. The place was not busy by any standards with maybe 4 people at the bar. by 8:15 we had not even been served our salad. I asked the bartender where our food was he said he had checked on it and it would be just a minute. the food runner came out with a platter of food and tried to deliver it to the folks next to us at the bar that had come it a half hour after us. The bartender interrupted this and said it was ours. It was not ours. The bartender then asked us what we had ordered and we told him a Cesar salad and the bbq sampler . It became clear that he never put in the order. He did not admit this to us but said he would pick up a round of drinks.Another 15 mins passed and they brought our salad. I told the bartender that we needed food and if it was going to be more than 5 mins we would just go elsewhere. He went into the back and said that they were \"really backed up\". We asked for the check he brought us a check for $39 fro the drinks we had. I spoke with the manager and he did pick up the tab and offer to box our meal when it was ready. We were so hungry that we had already called Cornish Pasty to order food. When we got there 10mins later our food was ready even though the had just gotten a party of 60 ahead of our order. I worked in restaurants in every position for 10yrs. I never made a mistake that big and if i had I would have admitted it. After 1.5 hrs we left never receiving our food from bootleggers"}
{"text":"Such a nice evening in downtown Scottsdale. Cool and delicious bbq dinner. Excellent service and friendly staff. The menu is simple and tasty. Be sure to sip a little Apple pie moonshine  Will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"Service was the best part of this place  Pork tacos. No sides. Bland. Certainly nothing Verde about the flavor. Bootlegger burger was good. The end."}
{"text":"Will not be back. Way over priced for what you get and it's not really good. Not really a 'smokehouse' like we anticipated."}
{"text":"Great place to eat BBQ when you are in Old Town Scottsdale.  Get the BBQ Express.  I had the Hot Links and Pulled Pork delicious.  What a great find a real jewel in the desert.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is AHmazing. Fabulous food all around. We shared the deviled eggs, potstickers, guacamole, bbq platter, asparagus, Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes and it was all was delicious."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fantastic prime rib and BBQ dinner here. MacnCheese was good too! Service was excellent. Glad we found this little gem. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Dinner with wings, salad, sandwiches.  All delicious!  Nice menu options."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, delicious lunch special with good portion sizes. Staff was extremely friendly. John Murphy knows his moonshine. He is extremely helpful and was a great bartender! Would recommend coming here"}
{"text":"In town for the Barrett Jackson auction and we have been in 3 separate times! Twice for drinks (apple pie moonshine.....AHHHHMAZING) and once for dinner! Food  was delicious! The biggest take away from all 3 trips was the exemplary service we received from Cameron! He remembered us during our 3rd visit and looked genuinely glad to see us. He is a great asset to the restaurant and we will definitely recommend Bootleggers to any future travelers. Cameron, if you see this, we appreciate you and please remember that your attitude determines so much in life.....stay the path, my friend! You are great!"}
{"text":"What a gift to have Bootleggers in town! From the Moonshine to the Turkey Legs- this is an eaters haven. A wonderful waitstaff is always eager to make your visit perfect, and the food is excellent...and did I mention the Moonshine!!!!!"}
{"text":"In town from Baltimore and happy to find out that this bar hosts the local Ravensl fan club. Turned out to be a great spot to view the game. Friendly staff. Food was very good.. Recommend the nachos."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks! But specifically, Dana, our server made our night. She was so wonderful and accommodating. We had a large group of girls for a bachelorette party and she went above and beyond. The Best Western plus sundial (Dino was his name, at the front desk) ruined our night completely with awful customer service and did not let us stay at their hotel, Bootleggers took us back in and allowed us to open gifts and have cake at the restaurant, while we figured out a new hotel arrangement. Dana and the Bootleggers staff saved our night, thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"This review is for Tim, the bar tender working the night of this post (March 20, 2016).  Spring training is happening and this place is extremely busy.  I am currently sitting at the bar as i write this and watching Tim move like nobody I ever saw before.  I don't envy Tim right now, but he is killing it and still being friendly to the customers!   Bootleggers,  you need to give this guy a fat raise."}
{"text":"I like moonshine so when I heard they had flights of shine I was there. Well the flights are really 3 different kinds with a bunch of flavors.  They have a house apple pie.  So much for the exciting flight of shine.    The bbq isn't exactly award winning either.  It's okay and the portions are big enough but there are much better places than this.  St Louis style ribs if you are interested.  They do have some interesting sides which come in fancy little skillets.  I almost thought they served them by themselves as they showed up way before the rest of the meal.  Which brings me to the service - awful.  Had to ask for cutlery. had to ask for our missing mac & cheese - 3 times.  It finally showed.  if the mac & cheese wasn't the best thing in the place I would have said forget it.  Mac & cheese is pretty good.  You can get tortillas instead of rolls with the meal which makes it a bit lighter."}
{"text":"In the spirit of Independence Day (which was yesterday), I'm writing this review about my new favorite good ol' American restaurant in the Valley...  I've been to this hidden gem twice so far and despite it being a tad bit out of my normal 2 mile radius, I'm sure I'll head back again soon.  I love that Bootleggers offers a very diverse menu.  When I went for lunch, I was wanting to be healthy and I ordered a kale salad with salmon.  The portion was huge, filling, and delicious.  The salmon was cooked to perfection.  In addition, there's a secret crunchy ingredient in it which I love - you'll have to go try it for yourself to see what it is!    The next time I went was a few nights ago... it was date night and my husband and I decided to splurge and order from the not so healthy options on the menu: chicken wings (we went spicy on the wings, but there are several flavors to choose from), brisket nachos, and a burger.  We ran into some friends there that joined us and wanted to share, so we added two kale salads and a side of asparagus to get our veggies in!  It was all so good that we ate almost every last morsel between the four of us.  We washed it all down with a few beers.  I like the recently renovated prohibition ambiance.  (Ask about the wood used throughout the restaurant and the windows on the wall, which have quite a bit of history behind them).  Bootleggers also has friendly service from the hostesses and the wait staff. (Alex was my server both visits).  It was a tad bit slower when we were in for dinner, but it was also packed that night.  And finally, while I'm not a moonshine drinker, those that are will be happy to know that there is plenty of it to choose from!"}
{"text":"Second visit...this time for happy hour.  Awesome drinks and BBQ.  The kiddo loved his chicken fingers and he IS a connoisseur. Lol.  Had chicken wings, boot dumplings, deviled eggs off the happy hour menu - all delicious! Then we tried Nacho Flat.  I'm not a nacho fan, but these were really good. Last visit sit we tried the BBQ sampler for two.  It was amazing.   Highly recommend for those who love their smoked meats!  Great service, yummy food, fantastic drinks!   Hubby's take - killer food!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for my son's birthday dinner as we had heard great things about this place. First, our server was super sweet and very courteous. My father ordered a chicken sandwich and he asked for mash potatoes instead of the standard chips, But when he received his food, he didn't have the potatoes he had the chips and asked the person who brought his food (the bartender) about the potatoes. My father was met with a rude response and instead of the bartender apologizing for the mistake, he just asked what do you want to do about it. My father says, just forget it. He doesn't like confrontation. Then they forgot my son's meal. Like literally forgot. If we didn't remind them, he never would've received it. I ordered the nachos flat which were not worth $15, and my mom ordered the prime rib and loved it. The husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich and said it was just \"ok\".  When we asked another server about dessert for my son's bday, she said, oh we're out of ice cream and walked away. Honestly, with all the hype it was a little disappointing overall. I wouldn't rush to go back. I wish the bartender was a little nicer to my father.  He had such an attitude and didn't smile at all. I really hate that especially coming to a restaurant. As my son put it, we got the \"Monday\" workers. In other words, they couldn't handle the weekend crowd."}
{"text":"Bootlegging is illegal but there should be an exception for bootlegging good food. Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse in Phoenix, AZ is taking food to illegally good levels. Who doesn't want good food?  I got to try their food for lunch on a rainy Sunday. I was immediately greeted by the scent of barbeque as soon as I got out of the car. The aroma of burnt wood and meat started to excite my taste buds. It was truly a modern day smokehouse feel when I walked in to the restaurant. Nice tables with orange chairs (GO SUNS!) to my left, a bar and long tables to my right, big booths for large groups in front of me and flat screens TVs all the way at the back. Everything felt very modern but still felt every bit a smokehouse.  Service was nice. We were greeted at the door with a smile and offered drinks a soon as we got to our table. I asked the bartender (which was our server on that day) to switch the TV to a different game and she was kind enough to advice me that she will have the channel changed soon as she finishes the drinks that she was preparing for everyone at the bar. It took a while and another similar request from another table but we finally got our channel changed. During our meal, our server constantly checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Again, the service was just nice.  The food was a little above average. I see the reason why they were given awards for Best Sandwich (Phoenix New Times), People's Choice for Tacos and Best Craft Cocktail (Arizona Taco Festival) in 2013. I ordered their Apple Brandy Shandy ($9), Cottage Fries ($5), Mac & Cheese ($9) and the BBQ Express Lunch ($15). All of them satisfied my taste buds. Everything was tasty and balanced. The only down side, the food is pricey and the serving size was too small. For a barbeque joint, you would expect a hearty meal that would satisfy your cowboy gut. I was informed that they heav a different menu for dinner. Since I was there for lunch, their menu did not shout out bbq except for their BBQ Express Lunch.  The Apple Brandy Shandy Moonshine Cocktail was very refreshing. The tangy apple flavor cuts through the strong moonshine bitterness. Since it was served on a mason jar, it was able to keep the moonshine character while still staying true to the modern theme. It was a great starter for a good meal.  The Cottage Fries was a delight. Maybe the best of what I ordered during my visit. The thinly sliced potato were fried to crispy perfection. The cajun flavors complimented the crispy potato fries. It felt like eating potato chips. It had a good spicy kick on each bite. It wasn't overly seasoned. In fact, the seasoning was right on.  I love their Mac & Cheese! The flavor wasn't flat. You get a little bit of saltyness and lots of the creaminess which I always love from a mac and cheese. They combine four types of cheese which complimented each other. Served on a skillet, the mac and cheese is kept warm to a perfect cheesy bite. Love it but the serving is a little too small for $9.  The BBQ express lunch I had was composed of 2 slices of beef brisket, 1/2 cup of pulled pork, cole slaw and tortillas. Very good smoky flavor on the brisket. I love the burned parts that added character and flavor to the meat. The pulled pork had a sweet and tangy finish. Both brisket and pulled pork were tender and very easy to chew. The coleslaw was a little flat. I would have wanted a little bit of seasoning. Maybe a little more salt. The tortilla, hmmm... it tasted like a tortilla. The star of the plate were the brisket and pulled pork which was served on a small skillet. Again, it is really good but I think its way too pricey. For $15, I would have wanted 2 more slices of the brisket and maybe another spoon of the pulled pork.  I would come back for the food. But maybe next time I'll try the dinner menu. Maybe i'll leave my cowboy appetite at home on my next visit. I am always willing to pay well for good food. As long as the serving size is comparable to the price. At this point, Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse is only a serving size (and maybe a few more BBQ menu options) away to becoming the next best BBQ joint in town.

{"text":"I had No plans on coming here. But my dad mentioned he had just recently seen a place on tv that had good bbq. Came to check it out and was not disappointed. Everything was great."}
{"text":"This is our very favorite go to place in Scottsdale. Food is delicious. Brisket nachos and brisket sandwich rock! Prime rib is amazing. A big thanks to Justin who always is professional, always remembers what we drink and what we like, and gives excellent service. Love this place."}
{"text":"A word of warning: there is a significant difference in the quality between the old town location and this, the Shea one. The service was among the worst I have ever experienced in a restaurant. A few minor mistakes are understandable, but this was far worse than that.  The dinner began poorly. Some of our group ordered lemonade, which looked and tasted like tap water with lemon squirted in it. Best case scenario was that they make their lemonade using some minute maid powder mix and watered it down beyond belief. Next, those who ordered wine were bought out two empty glasses which sat there, empty, for a full ten minutes before the drinks were brought out in glasses and the empty ones were taken away without ever being used. Nice touch. We ordered an appetizer, the bacon board, and it was the only enjoyable thing about our experience. Some of the selections were truly delicious. Even still, our server clearly did not know the difference between the selections on the board. After finishing our appetizer we sat at the table, receiving no attention, for a long period of time. The one time an employee spoke to us in this interlude was to ask us if they could take our menus, and we still hadn't even ordered yet. When we finally placed our orders, they did not come out for some time. In between this we tried to order more wine. Ten minutes after this a different waiter came to double check the order. Ten minutes after this, we decided to take matters into our own hands and go to the bar to fulfill the order. Our waitress then came back and took our orders once more, which was one of the most cringe inducing episodes I've ever seen in a restaurant. When the food finally came out it was not all together, and there was a significant gap between when the first dish was served and everyone received all their food and sides. Had the food been excellent it could certainly have saved bootleggers from a one star review. However it was nothing to write home about. Honestly if the service at a place like this continues to be this bad, you're better off going to dickies BBQ further on down Shea. It's really a shame because I feel that bootleggers could really be a great place to enjoy some BBQ. I can also report that we were not the only people who received unsatisfactory service.  If you've read this far, I hope it is clearly evident just how bad the experience at bootleggers was."}
{"text":"They make their own Moonshine.  Very friendly staff and accommodating for families. Their Apple Pie Moonshine in amazing!!"}
{"text":"Sublime cocktails and BBQ. I get the BBQ pork sandwich. It's got a cozy atmosphere and pretty good service. Be careful though, the bill will add up with lots of cocktails and sides!"}
{"text":"WOW. Came here to meet a friend for lunch in her area. Had never been here or heard of it. Did some research and it seemed okay. Such an understatement! So delicious!!!! Must haves : Bootlegger burger, brisket, pulled pork, and Mac and Cheese. Excellent service, excellent BBQ. MUST visit!!!!! If you don't you're missing out."}
{"text":"Hate it when a place gets greedy... This was one of my favorite spots, however they changed the menu, again, which I understand is necessary in the first years, but literally doubling the price of your meals is outrageous. The food is great, and was previously reasonably priced (still enough to open a second location!), but I guess they wanted more. Bring back the BBQ program and get over yourselves..."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot. We've eaten here several times and love the food. The bacon appetizer is great, and my personal fave is the BBQ brisket. Also try their cocktails."}
{"text":"I am a stingy stingy stingy about my BBQ because my parents are from the south and they made the good stuff at home.  In general the BBQ in Arizona has been really lacking and I only visit a few places.  I get people that tell me all the time that this place is really good, or that place, or oh this is the best I've ever had.  Most of the time I am very disappointed.  A BBQ place in downtown Scottsdale was a bit surprising to me but I had to give it a shot.  The smoke smell was bellowing out of the restaurant and we made a beeline for it.    The menu was expansive and everything looked good.  The appetizers had brisket chili, wings, and a bacon board.  Did I just write bacon board??  Yep...the couple next to me got it and it looked amazing.  The bartender agreed that it is ridiculously good but I will be trying that on another visit.  I decided to go with the short rib because it had a sweet Dr. Pepper sauce.  It was highly recommend that I try the macaroni and cheese as my side.  Let me tell that I am finally happy with the \"smoke.\"  The smoke is good y'all.    The inside joke about the \"smoke\" is that I stopped and talked to the manager and I told him about my Que dilemma in Arizona which was turned around tonight.  We both agreed that good smoke is....good smoke and they've got good smoke.  Get you some good smoke."}
{"text":"Awesome gastropub in the 32nd St/Shea corridor. Went on a Friday night, every dish we ordered was amazing. Great selection of drafts. I had the Kale salad, braised kale side and salmon entrée. All three were perfect. My friends had the barbeque brisket and pulled pork, and both were awesome. They had a different kind of cole slaw, vinegar based, light and tasty. The cobbler and the cherry shake were great finishers. A great addition to the neighborhood, along with Rusconi's it's a major upgrade. I'll be back....."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Bacon Board -- delicious and plenty for 2 (or 3). Pulled pork with slaw on the sandwich was great and plentiful. I hate that I hadn't heard about this place sooner! Great food, great service."}
{"text":"Bacon, beer and moonshine... Enough said! Bacon board was incredible!! Selection of moonshines were dangerous. Several craft beers on tap, many local. Also tried the pulled pork entree- amazing! Heard the brisket is their specialty but they were out unfortunately. Mashed pitied with baked cheese crust on top was delicious! Service was very good and attentive. Fun, relaxed, laid back vibe with mellow lighting. Lots of candles and mason jar lights... Brick walls... Upscale BBQ feel. I would certainly come back! Gotta try the brisket!"}
{"text":"This great bbq restaurant has a modern feel and a fun menu. If you can tolerate the drunk tourists you are sure to encounter (local tip: don't sit in the bar area up front) then you will likely have a nice meal.  In terms of food, I rarely make it past the appetizer menu. The bacon board is as good as it sounds and makes for a good first-time order. It can feed a table of 4-5 and will leave your taste buds ready for an entree or another app.  The bar menu is decent and they do not skimp on the liquor. I have enjoyed all of the moonshine house drinks so far. The price is a bit steep at $11+ so have a glass before you go."}
{"text":"I'm excited for my next trip here to eat dinner!  My BF and I stopped by here for a nightcap after I read a small write up on AZCENTRAL.com.  The décor is awesome!  Very warm, inviting, and laid back!  We sat at the bar and were happy to see a bartender that we knew from a previous establishment.  Choosing from their selection of hand-crafted cocktails, we ordered a Tito's Mojito & French 77.  Both were DELICIOUS but I had a taste of the Motito and had to have my own for round two.    Everybody sitting next to us was scarfing down their food and it smelled wonderful.  I can't wait to become a regular here!"}
{"text":"Five star food service bartender and ambiance. We popped in on a \"Sunday Funday\". Just so happened they have happy hour prices all day and night on food and drinks every Sunday!  Tim/Timmy the bartender has a great balance of being a ton of fun and very professional all in one. We were extemely impressed with this spot!  The food was absolutely amazing some being pretty traditional bbq along with some of it being traditional putting their own unique twist into it. We ordered our food off the happy hour menu it was fun to pick and choose the ala carte tacos. Green chilli pork tacos, salmon tacos  (salmon cooked to protection), brisket tacos and a wonton appetizer that was out of this world. We left full with our pockets not being empty. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a great meal I had!! Just a super comfortable spot to bring friends from out of town.  My boy Matty and his wife are in from good old New Jersey.  Being 30 min outside of Manhattan they know great food and loved the food here."}
{"text":"What a FIND!!!  First time in, made reservation online.  perfect table waited for us, just as I requested.  Staff was prompt in attending to us getting setup and then Dana took over!  A fantastic combination of competence and Sass!  Just what is perfect!!  Fiance and I had the mussels, brisket and salmon.  All were top notch.  Only complaint is that the mussels were so good, there should have been more in the bowl!!!  Going to be back again really soon!  We called April the manager over to tell her how great everything was and especially Dana.  Great atmosphere, patio is going to be killer when it cools a hair and the food and service...well...er...were worth writing about!!"}
{"text":"First...brisket is them best I've had. Not overly smokey but the most (I hate the term) moist I've had. Pulled pork and wings are not to miss. John Murphy makes the most delicious cocktails in all of Scottsdale. Can not wait to make it back!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The menu advertises 1/2 pound brisket?  Really it was two slices.  My daughter in law ordered the grilled cheese. Waiter asked did you want tomato? They charged a extra dollar for a single slice of tomato.  The bacon board was tasty had a few slices with a couple of dabs of dip.   For 16.00 that was a rip off.  My son ordered the pulled  pork which came with Coe slaw on the sandwich.  He doesn't like coleslaw and they replaced the sandwich and brought out fries then charged  additional 2.00 again another charge not disclosed. The cauliflower for 4.00 was cold and hard.  The hostess never stopped playing with he hair.  The severs run continual an gov a uneasy feeling.  I was very disappointed.   Save your money!!!!!"}
{"text":"I Really liked this place, it is very cool inside, but the food is better; the service was very good too.  We Had the brisket dinner, burger, and brisket sandwich and everyone raved!  To top it off we had an apple clobber desert, that was easily one of best cobbler's I have ever had.  Tried some moonshine too, liked the Blackberry one. I will  Definitely  go back to this place."}
{"text":"Their pulled pork melts in you mouth! We couldn't resist the smoky smell wafting down the street. Also the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"This was so good, food on point. We had a meat sampler with brisket, pork, and couple other meats. It was a little pricey but worth the money. It was packed so we had to sit at the middle table that had very uncomfortable chairs. The waiter was cool and very informative on our food choices. He let us sample a apple moonshine drink they had that was good. Would def come back again. Nice and clean bathrooms and other areas. Old town scottsdale has amazing food, hands down."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food at all. I absolutely love brisket and all I could taste and chew on was fat. It was disgusting. I couldn't eat my dinner so I ordered pork which was better than the brisket but still really greasy and did not taste good. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrible.   Food may be good but you will have to wait a long time to get it. Even when the restaurant is empty."}
{"text":"SO-so experience.   After reading all the reviews about the bacon board, we ordered it. A huge tray of bacon being delivered to your table is impressive. BUT the actual bacon was not what everyone says it is. My boyfriend and I agreed if we come back we won't order it again. My boyfriend ordered the brisket (their signature item) and said it was \"Eh\".  The nacho flat was BOMB as was the mac n cheese.   The service IS terribly slow (the restaurant was NOT busy, we were one of two tables our waitress was serving) for no apparent reason. That's not necessarily a bad thing if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"First time coming here, we tried their sample sampler plate and it turned out pretty good. Not a big fan of their turkey but the rest was good.  Next time getting their brisket for sure!"}
{"text":"The service and food were AMAZING!! I LOVE the prime rib!!! The server was very attentive and extremely friendly with out being intrusive. I am so sorry to have only given 4 stars! The only reason it isn't 5 is because the lights needed to be turned up. It was WAY too dark. It was almost hard to see the menu or our food. However, I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"My family stopped at Bootleggers for lunch while walking around old town Scottsdale. I had the Lunch Express with brisket and pulled pork and a side of mac and cheese. All were well prepared and mouth-watering. We also shared the pork ribs which were tender and delicious. Everything made for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great decor and fun date night of you are into unique cocktails like the moonshine and great bbq. Recommend hickmans deviled eggs for starters and getting the bbq sampler for two or you can get it for four. We loved the brisket, pulled pork and ribs all flavorful!"}
{"text":"When we pulled into the parking lot, the  smell in the air was so strong and fragrant of BBQ, that we immediately had high expectations for the meal we were about to eat.  We sat ourselves in the back, but it was so loud, that we moved to the bar closer to the front of the restaurant.  It was much quieter there.  The walls are covered in wood and metal to compliment the industrial theme, so the noise just sort of bounces around with nothing to absorb it.    It was happy hour, so we ordered a plate of nachos.  There were huge flavorful chunks of avocado, but only very teeny tiny pieces of brisket on them.  We ordered the PBLT which is a BLT sandwich, but the bacon is replaced with juicy pork belly.  The pork belly was juicy and tender, but the bread on the sandwich was so over buttered that all I could focus on was the greasiness of the butter.  We also ordered the brisket with a side of potato salad.  I absolutely loved the potato salad.  It was chunky and super flavorful.  It was a mustard based potato salad.  The brisket came as a huge portion, but my hubby was sad to discover that at least half of each piece was all fat.  Of the meat that was there, the tenderness and flavor of the meat was good.  It's just hard to love any brisket after you've eaten the stuff from Little Miss BBQ!"}
{"text":"I spent the weekend in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale and I was so pleased with all of the food we ate. Usually when traveling finding that perfect meal can be difficult, not in this case. Where do I even start?  We were put on a wait list for 20-30 minutes and were able to walk around Old Town because they texted us when our table was ready. It ended up being about 15 minutes which was a pleasant surprise.   Our waitress was at our table within minutes to take our drink order, and the drinks came out more quickly than I had expected, and they were DELICIOUS.   Everything on the menu looked too good to pick from so we ended up ordering the BBQ sampler for two with corn and Mac n cheese on the side.   All of the meat was extremely tender and moist, not overly smoked, 3 different sauces to choose from, I was so glad we chose that so we could try it all. Mac n cheese was just to die for, just crunchy enough on the top, noodles were cooked just right, and the sauce was not too rich for the already very filling meal.  They also kindly let us move to a larger table when we had more people coming in for drinks.   The only downfall was that the drinks were about average for what I could tell cost wise, so so good, but I'm not quite sure there was as much alcohol in them as there could have been for the price, but that will not even knock this place down a star.   All around the atmosphere, food, and service were some of the best I've experienced anywhere I've been!  Thank you bootleggers!"}
{"text":"Their brisket is amazing!! They also have really good specialty cocktails. Highly recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Hmmm what can I say about this first time experience?! Yummy in my tummy, yup! The Cottage fries with cheese, super tasty. I got the st louis ribs- what a wonderful explosion of flavor in my mouth. My 2 year old son even enjoyed them. To top it off, I got the peach blueberry cobbler, another tasty treat! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Have seen this place many times since I occasionally work in Old Town. Decided to go with a few friends for a glass of wine/beer after work. Wow! Can't believe I didn't go sooner! Walking up you can smell the deliciousness from the smoker. Loved the decor! It's modern, and rustic rolled into one. Super cool vibe!! We sat in the bar area so the bartender, Larry, came to take our order. He was awesome! Just the right amount of humor and hospitality. Loved him!! Just needing a snack, we ordered the brisket nachos. Wow! They were amazing!! I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner! Just disappointed I didn't try this place sooner!"}
{"text":"Our server was outstanding, the food was delicious whether it was brisket, salad, tacos, or mac and cheese. We sat outside which was lovely and parking is available easily directly behind the restaurant. Great experience."}
{"text":"Bootleggers was the perfect place to go after a long, dragging Monday. My beau picked me up from work and we got there just in time for happy hour.  I highly recommend getting their pulled pork sandwich as a happy hour treat. They were delicious. The brioche bun was delicious and pork was succulent.  For my happy hour cocktail, I got the blueberry brumble and the beau got their Catdaddy Old Fashion. The brumble was delicious and very refreshing. The Old Fashion was a tad on the sweet side.  We also ordered dinner there. I went for their Monday night special, Fried Chicken & Waffles while the beau had their ribs. The Chicken & Waffles were good, it was just a bit too sweet for me. My beau had the ribs which were very very good. I snuck a couple of pieces myself.   Kudos to the waiter who gave us a military discount too, I'm not sure if they do that often.  Overall, Bootleggers is a great place to stop by after work for a good drink and some good ol ribs."}
{"text":"This place is great, and not too hard to find a table at this time of year.  The meats are the stars, of course, and they deliver.  There have been menu changes since we first came a few years back, and I would recommend giving them another shot if you haven't been in awhile.  The brisket is moist, smokey, and flavorful, served with a great crispy slaw and tortillas.  We also really enjoyed the turkey, also wonderfully smoked and of course juicy.  We have yet to try the bacon board but that's gonna happen.  Sides are also wonderful, we recommend the smashed potatoes and broccolini especially, although it's hard to pass up the mac and cheese.  Very unique and inventive drink menu; some are on the sweeter side if you like that sort of thing, and they have some very good limited rotating draft beers as well."}
{"text":"LaDonna was awesome! She knew exactly what we would like and we were not disappointed! Bacon board, sampler and the peach cobbler, all outstanding!"}
{"text":"I saw the restaurant on the PBS show Check Please and wanted to try it.  We made a reservation through Yelp and went to give it a try.  In a strip mall but the inside of the place was nice.  I knew I wanted the bacon board and ordered that and some drinks off of the happy hour menu.  The food and drinks were really good however the service was not good.  Chris was our waiter and was no where to be found.  We really wanted to order more food by with this type of nonexistent service we did not order anything else."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED. $6 for three halves of deviled eggs. That's $4 per whole egg, and they weren't anything special! Also, my 22mo old son was very hungry and cranky, so I asked for a piece of bread while waiting for appetizers and they charged us for it. This kids burger was basically a slider and costs $7. The cauliflower purée was flavorless. But it wasn't ALL terrible as we really enjoyed the brisket and turkey slices. But be prepared for overpriced small portions."}
{"text":"As an anniversary dinner, my wife and I picked Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse. We felt that this was up our ally and overall we are impressed. We love good food at reasonable prices and Bootleggers did deliver.  When I first walked in I was kinda worried because it was empty. Which could be good and bad. Good because we can be seated and receive quick customer service. The bad could vary from customer service to delivery of their food/plates. We did go on a Thursday night at 5pm.  It did get busier as we got to the end of our meal so we did avoid the rush. Overall we were impressed with our visit.   I did research that may benefit anyone who wants to avoid dinner rushes in Arizona. Please keep in mind, time varies from restaurant to restaurant and geography does play a factor, commonly in Arizona dinner rushes are 6:00pm - 7:45pm. Overall the restaurant itself is very nice and welcoming. Had very good ambiance!  I ordered the St. Louise Ribs 1/2 Rack and my queen ordered smoked prime rib. Everything was smoked/cooked well and definitely can taste the smoke. If you like smoked meat, this is the place to go! Portion size is reasonable and prices is fair for location, environment and the plates they offer.  Our server Austin was amazing. Very balanced on his service and answered all of our questions. If management is reading this, please recognize him for his work.  We'll be coming back here in the future. Interested in trying other dishes they have."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I highly recommend the BBQ sampler. The smoked turkey is really good. The place has a nice atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Stumbled across Bootleggers while wondering around Old Town on a Thursday night. They were open until 11, which was a plus since we didn't get out until around 10pm. This is a second location but I haven't tried the first.   We split a bunch of dishes with friends. I thought the smoked corn app was a bit dry, but one person really liked it. It had a nice char and hot sauce, but wasn't too spicy. Crispy rock shrimp and cheddar grits was recommended by the waitress and everyone thought it was very good. I was hoping the smoked chicken wings would be more of a dry rub but they're definitely saucy. The BBQ sampler is a must. Everything on it was delicious, even the turkey. The brisket was awesome. We had a side of mac and cheese that was ok - if it was thicker I would have been happier.  They have a nice sized patio with a great fire place."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food since I haven't eaten here but I love the cocktails.  The apple pie moonshine is delish!  I dream about I. I also enjoyed the moonshine sampler. All the drinks I have tried have been amazing."}
{"text":"The ribs are super excellent smokey goodness. The smashed potatoes have smoke gouda on them for the win!  The asparagus was perfectly cooked yum yum yum! The apple pie moonshine tasted way better than expected.  Friendly waitstaff, great ambiance and comfortable decor.  Two people $46 with tip.  Well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great selection of smoked and BBQ meats with delicious sides.  Enjoyed the moonshine sampler as well.  The ribs were our favorite of the meat selection.  Fast service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I recently had a chance to stop in at Bootleggers in Scottsdale, Arizona. While I was only there for a few minutes to grab a snack and a quick drink, I liked the place a great deal.   The Nacho Flat was delicious. It was made with brisket hash, had cheddar cheese, jalapenos, cilantro, avocado and a chipotle sauce - yummy. For my beverage, it was an \"Old Smoky\" which had a white lighting base along with a variety of fruits & berries. This is not typically my type of cocktail ... but it was pretty good. Generally, it is wine or bourbon for me.  The wait staff was super ... friendly and helpful.  I will go back at some point for a full meal."}
{"text":"Solid pulled pork sandwich. The Vibe is pretty weird in this place, but the food is right on"}
{"text":"Tried Bootleggers for the first time last night. Food was very good and fresh. Had the bacon board and nachos for an appetizer. Both were amazing!   After those heavy appetizers I had the cobb salad for my entree. It was also very good, very fresh!  My only complaint were the drink prices. $9 for a low ball jack and coke? We are not talking gentlemen jack or single barrel! Regular jack $9? Last time I paid that price was at the Phoenician Resort. Take note Bootleggers, I won't drink there until you fix it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here for lunch and dinner and it's pretty good. The only thing we weren't happy with was the cornbread, it was dry and not sweet at all, other than that everything is great and we will continue to come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"What is it about Scottsdale and all the bomb food, not much else to do but eat and drink. We came here for dinner last night and it was awesome, the ribs are the best I've ever had, like ever ever, soooo smoky and tender. Sides were also on point, creamy mac and cheese and crispy potatoes. My first time trying moonshine and it was surprisingly good, our kind waitress gave me a sample of the apple pie moonshine and I was hooked. Super friendly and fast service, the kids loved it too. I would recommend this to anyone in Scottsdale looking for some bomb bbq."}
{"text":"I've been here four times, and each time, I get pretty much the same thing: bacon board; Sneaky Petes (no longer on menu, but ask for this tequila cocktail... yum!); and the wedge with chicken. All are dependable, yummy and MINE ALL MINE. Seriously, jalapeno bacon? Who read my mind and made this worthy creation, for which I'll always be grateful?   My friends always try different things, and being the mooch I am, when it comes to good food, I've determined that everything is worthy of trying.   Only area which could use *some* improvement - the service. A couple of times, during less-busy times, we have had to ask what happened to our server. Did we scare him/her away? :/   Go enjoy the smoky scents and tasty foods!"}
{"text":"Found this place while randomly looking for a dinner spot on Yelp. What a great find! We arrived with 40min to spare for happy hour specials and it also happened to be Wine Wednesday! Say no more ...  Austin was our server and he was friendly and attentive, he said he was a new server but we couldn't tell he seemed very knowledgable and enthusiastic about the food and drinks at Bootleggers. We tried nearly every item on the HH menu and we shared a rack of ribs that were off the bone good!  A solid 4 star \"Better than most BBQ house\" experience for us! Such a cool find and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here twice in 2 days..Timmy and April were amazing. Get the Apple pie drink, nachos, meat platter."}
{"text":"One of the most bizarre experiences we've ever had a restaurant.  This review is a little late, so don't know if anything has change since then.  But this is what happened.  We came in on a holiday weekend at around 3:30pm.  The place was practically empty.  There was a couple sitting at the bar, a table of about 8 people and another couple that walked in about the same time we did.  We waited for a bit at the front, but when no one came, we walked to the dining room area and were told by a gentlemen to sit anywhere.  He seemed to be the only person working so it took awhile before he came back to take our drink order.  My husband wanted a beer and was asking about the various brews.  He was pondering which to choose when this waiter said, \"If you're going to think about it any longer, then let me know when you're ready.  I've got other things to do.\" Wow! Really? We had been handed lunch menus but didn't see anything we wanted.  However, they have this board listing the various barbecue meats sold by the pound hanging on a wall in the back of the room.  When he finally came back to take our order, I started to order off of that board.  He said, \"That's just for takeout.\"  I'm thinking, \"What, you can't make up a plate like rather than packing it \"to go\"?\"  But, whatever.  I ask if they have any ribs because we didn't see any on the lunch menu.  His answer, \"We don't serve that until 4:00pm.\"  It is now 3:45pm.  So, he says, rather rudely, \"Why don't you just order \"X\" off the lunch menu.  That will get you some of what you want.\"  No offer to see if some of the other stuff might be ready a little early or even a suggestion to order some drinks and an appetizer while we wait.  We left and ate somewhere else.  Bottom line is, at no time did we feel welcome there.  It makes us wonder if we were experiencing some vaguely disguised prejudice since we are Asian."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  Best Beef brisket i have ever had.  The drinks and beer list are great.  However the wait for food is excruciatingly slow.  The attitude we received from what appeared to be a manager when we asked for a food item that was not delivered with the rest of the parties meal, was really unacceptable.  Poor guy didn't eat for 15 minutes after the rest of us received our meal, and we got a lot of lip when we asked about it.  Additionally, the happy hour is just smaller portions of the appetizer plates for less money.  So if you get the nacho flat at happy hour, it's less $$ but served on a tiny plate. less than half the normal size.  So you get what you pay for but don't try selling HH appetizers as a special deal. Selling the same size for a reduced price is a happy hour deal, what you are doing is just a rip off.  I\"m a local, so fool me once... but i won't be back to this location -Shea has a better vibe.  Too many great places around downtown to put up with this attitude."}
{"text":"Yummy! Some of the best food I've had in awhile. Service can be a little blasé, so if you're in a hurry to go anywhere, think about getting take out. The atmosphere is pretty chill and they have a great looking bar menu, with happy hour specials. The location is tucked in a little bit from Scottsdale Rd and parking sucks, but it's well worth the trek to get there.   There was not a single thing we ordered that was bad. We didn't much care for the guacamole, but it was still good. As a table for 3 people, we got the Deviled Eggs, the Guacamole, Dumplings for appetizers and shared the BBQ for 2 with sides of the Macaroni and Cheese, the Mashed Potatoes, and grilled asparagus. We left nothing behind - it was amazing. The brisket was so tender and we really liked that everything with the BBQ platter wasn't pre-sauced- the meat was the star of the show! The Dr. Pepper sauce was crack! We would reorder all of the same stuff over again. The food was fresh and delicious. A word to the wise with the appetizers- the deviled eggs and dumplings only have 3 servings per order, you might think about ordering double if it's more than a group for 2-3.   Would highly recommend this place to anyone! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service from Swade and John. Helpful answering questions about the menu. Really yummy tacos and drinks."}
{"text":"Peg and I went to the Shea location last Monday night, and found the experience to be terrific. We moved here from KC and BBQ for us in the Valley has been a bit underwhelming. I know that we all have different tastes and memories of great  Q, and our visit to this place was reminiscent of all things great.  Last night, we visited the other location in Old Town Scottsdale. Even in the midst of Thursday night (Art Walk) when parking was a bit tenuous, Chef Jones, Jacob, and Lauren (along with John who is learning the art of service) made the meal, once again, memorable. The BBQ sampler, wings, mac and cheese, and slaw were just as on point as the meal from the mothership. It is apparent that quality control is important as there wasn't any sign of dropping the ball. Add Sam and Dave to the mix in the tune department, and the experience was once again a delight. I am thrilled to know that good BBQ is alive and well in the city, with no signs of running out of food after a couple of hours.  Thanks for the great product and service. I respect Chef Jones's background in fine dining...and I can tell you for sure  that the dining here is...mighty fine!  We shall be doing a threepeat soon.   Dr. Bob"}
{"text":"As we all know, 'Q is in the eye of the beholder. Peg and I stopped in tonight interested to see what would happen after hearing that Stephen Jones had made the move to this place from the Hound. What a wonderful introduction!   Tami was our server and was a welcoming guide. Alex was the ultimate in making sure that the experience was better than average, and the BBQ sampler definitely filled the bill. The meat was succulent, sweettangymoist wonderfulness. The links snapped and the meat on the ribs did NOT fall off the bones....a great thing!  The mac tasted home made and the slaw was not the sometimes commercial onion mess. Served with tortillas that held up to the sauce, the meal was terrific.  I thought they had me with a fried chicken on a jalapeno waffle special....but that shall happen in due time.  This is a wonderful addition and just off the 51 and Shea....a very easy in and out with parking to spare.  Thank you Chef Jones, Alex, and Tami....we shall return!"}
{"text":"It was a nice diversion from my standby Houston's and Chelseas Kitchen. Great buildout, really nice staff, good food!"}
{"text":"Where's the flavor? Definitely did not hit the mark for me. Flavor was little to none. Had the BBQ sampler, the brisket was a tad bit on the dryer side. Couldn't really taste the smoke flavor as well. Server didn't tell us what bbq was what.   Granted this place does cater to the older clientele and I can see why the flavor was cut back a lot. Also could've been a off day for the kitchen staff.  Had the brownie for dessert, seemed like they baked it off right there due to how hard the crust was and how dry the brownie was itself."}
{"text":"Ambience is very nice. Very pretty Mexican style restaurant. Wine list is fair. The menu is very interesting with foods of different flavor of Mexico with a French flair.  Mixed drinks list is good and the tequila list is huge.  Food was delicious and slightly overpriced.   A good place for Mexican food"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this jem on the Yelp search for BBQ. We try to eat healthy most days but allow ourselves one meal we've been craving on Sundays. Oh boy did we hit the jackpot with Bootleggers Food & Drinks! From their home made moonshine, to the bacon board appetizer (yes, I said BACON BOARD), to the ribs & pulled pork sandwich entrees - we were both in hog heaven - pun intended. The food & drink were great! The location is in a small strip mall on the SE corner of Shea and the 51. Formerly the location was a Dirty Drummer and I am told - quite a dive. However, the modern-rustic hip decor was super sleek!  And couple all of that with spectacular service...we will definitely be back and next time with friends in tow!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, this will probably move to 4 stars....they're really on the knife edge between 3 and 4.  LOVE:  Bacon Board taste and presentation.  Its truly worthy of being a signature item.  Cauliflower steak and cottage fries are lovely bits of comfort.  The intimate lighting and design of this place is pretty special, too.   Most plates are served with a good bit of panache in terms of presentation.  LIKE:  The PBLT sandwich, which has ranged on different visits from awesome to above-average.  The service on most nights is pretty good, although I have been left parched a few times for quite a while when sitting at the bar waiting....and waiting....and waiting... for the tender to make her way back to me.  I'm OK with:  the subtle smoke flavoring on the meats...although I tend to prefer a stronger smoke.  I'm also OK with the prices of most items, and I don't feel like I have overpaid when I go here, although nothing screams \"great value\".  Not that there is anything wrong with restaurants charging what the market is willing to pay...but hey, this is YELP, and one of my stars is typically reserved for good or great value.  There are a few rather pedestrian offerings that don't seem to live up to expectations, such as the Nachos.    DISLIKE:  The price of the bacon board...no bueno!  Also, when bootleggers opened, it had the promise of being amazing in the beer/bar context, but I feel like they rotate their taps way too infrequently, so there is rarely something new for me to try.    I see alot of 4 and 5 star reviews for this place...and I can truly respect that, as I can see why many people would really, really like this place.  But for me, meh.  To become a mainstay in my rotation, I personally would need a wider beer selection, more smoke in the meats, and a permanent 25% off coupon lol."}
{"text":"This place was interesting but not exactly what I was hoping for in a smoke house.  I found the meats to be of good quality but a bit under smoked.  The pricing was fair and the service was great.   The restaurant was relatively quiet and was split into two main sections.  The bar on one side with a dining room on the other side."}
{"text":"We had a great meal. We started with the Disaronno Sours. Excellent drinks and you get to keep the glasses. We had the deviled eggs and wings for an appetizer. They were both good. I had the 1/2 order of the  St Louis ribs and they had a great smokey taste. I wish I had ordered the full meal.  My daughter had the pulled pork and she enjoyed it. We ended the meal with the Jack Daniels brownie which was a great ending to the meal. I would also like to add that we had a great waitress. Dani was very friendly and made great suggestions. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place a lot when I lived in the neighborhood and it was fairly new. It consistently impresses me. Stopped by tonight for a first date...staff is always helpful, kind and courteous.  Suggestions on wine and drinks and always a good pour.  Atmosphere is good for intimate meeting, group happy hour or alone at the bar.  The smell from the parking lot alone, is enough to make you hungry. Only wish is that there were a few more healthier choices with all the proteins they offer. 20 min drive for me now, but always worth it and I'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"What kind of BBQ place has no cornbread on the menu? Then we were told they were out of ribs....then told they were out of fries. By the time our food came, we almost forgot what we ordered because of all the substitutions. The pulled pork was good; however, it was barely room temperature. Would have been much better if it was actually hot. Nice atmosphere and our waitress was very friendly. I'd like to go back to try some of their moonshine drinks."}
{"text":"Stacy took great care of us. I had the salmon BLT, which was wonderful! My husband had the pulled pork. Get something with bacon on it. I think  it was the best bacon I've ever had. We will certainly be back to Bootleggers!"}
{"text":"they have a bacon board. read that three times and tell me it's not the best thing you've read all day. other than that stellar menu option, they have great southern bbq. it's not tex-mexicanized which is much appreciated for my north carolinian husband.   sunday brunch is a large mason jar bloody mary with a skewered slider, french fry, pickle, olive, lemon and lime with a beer back. they do not joke about brunch. that's what you get. that's all you need... maybe two... maybe three. you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Really bad food. If you like smokey meat don't go. It's poorly done with no taste. It smells good when you walk in but that's it."}
{"text":"We were quite disappointed, as we came because of the Drive-ins, Diners, and Dive recommendation. We arrived on a Friday at 3:15 pm and ordered the sampler for two and a wedge salad. The wedge salad was good, but could have been better. The pork belly was over done and tasteless. The sampler ribs were good, but the other meat was dry, like it had been cut in the morning and sat all day.  Putting sauce on it and adding it to the provided tortillas with the house coleslaw made it acceptable.  A gentleman near us got the prime rib at 4pm, right when it came out of the smoker oven and gave us a taste.  It was tender, juicy, and flavorful."}
{"text":"Visiting on winter hiatus from snowy Wisconsin.  Food was plentiful and very tasty. We ordered the nachos and split the brisket tacos. The nachos were plenty for 2 but could definitely be shared by 4. Jeanette was our server and great! Her beer and menu recommendations were spot on! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Cocktails are sooooo good!! I got a Bombay Gin Martini but honestly my cousin got a Catdaddy Old Fashion and I wish I got that instead it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall. Decor is very nice and matches the BBQ food. They make their own moonshine, and oh my is it amazing. It was my first time trying it and I could not believe how it didn't taste like alcohol at all. Favorite flavor of moonshine was Apple pie, literally tasted like dessert. I also ordered the pulled pork, and it was just ok. I expected more flavor to it, but with bbq sauce it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Decided to try Bootleggers again after my first experience wasn't very good.   Same experience.   Food is good but portions are extremely small for the price.   The table along the walls with combination booth and chair seating are uncomfortably close to each other.   We noticed this, as did the several different parties of people that sat next to us.   Don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"This place is overly priced for TINY portions, not very tasty food. I really don't understand the appeal.  Went there with a few folks and ordered A LOT of food to try it out. Pork belly is a plate of 4 bubbly fat, NOT crispy. The chilled salmon appetizer which was for people to share was a semi seasoned piece of fish smaller than a deck of card, with nothing else for 16 dollars! There were more dishes but honestly not much to write about. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Bootleggers Scottsdale is the place to eat. We had a party of 6- an not one of us could find 1 bad thing to say. The Bacon Board appetizer was very tasty. We had a variety of main dishes including the pulled pork sandwich, and BBQ Sampler (which 3 people could share). The meats were so flavorful and melted in our mouth. Not saturated in sauce and the spicy links were outstanding. The Cauliflower and the Kale side dishes- I could have just eaten those and left happy! For Dessert - our waiter recommended the Cherry Vanilla milkshake and I was not disappointed, YUMMY and not real heavy- Perfect.  The whole atmosphere was very casual, not too loud. The service was outstanding!! Our waiter was Jeremy and he was always recommending a drink, dish or dessert item- he was never off the mark- The drink (Apple Pie Moonshine)-WOW- started the experience off with a bang! Jeremy was very attentive- but not smothering, checked back often and did not appear to want to rush us out- even though it was Saturday night and they were busy. He was friendly and fun- but didn't go overboard. I will definitely be back with more friends."}
{"text":"Pretty solid food.  The PBLT is definitely the star and I highly recommend it.  Drinks are good but can be a bit pricey.  Granted, they have greatly improved their happy hour (there wasn't much 'happy' about it originally.)   Probably the most notable issue is the spotty service.  It can be pretty difficult to get a server's attention and the owner can at times be a bit aloof when dealing with clients."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come here for a Saturday date night. When considering our options, we were sold when we saw the bacon board on the menu. It did not disappoint! It was an excellent and delicious start to our nice (giant) dinner.  For our main course we had the BBQ sampler for two, as well as the shrimp and grits appetizer because I just couldn't help myself! The shrimp and grits were simply glorious. I may have preferred grilled or sautéed shrimp, rather than fried, but the other ingredients did a great job of balancing the richness of the fried shrimp and bacon. Marvelous.   The sampler was very good, but not amazing. I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile.  Since we brought up the missing turkey,  we were given a cobbler desert for free. That's about as much as I would pay for that dessert - $0 - as it tasted like hot, vaguely-fruity mush with a layer of raw flour on top. Whatever... they don't claim to be dessert experts, so what did I expect? I just know better for next time. ;)  Atmosphere is great - cozy, clean and modern. Just hipster enough to feel cool, but not so much to make you feel uncomfortable if you didn't show up with facial hair or a vintage t-shirt. Service is not as attentive as I would prefer, but most likely due to having too much to do, as opposed to a lack of effort. Everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and absolutely fantastic barbecue. The sampler provided a great opportunity to try all of the different meats. The rib meat fell off of the bone but the sausage is a little bit spicy for me. Three different barbecue sauces give you whatever taste you were looking for. Personally, I like the Dr Pepper barbecue sauce.   Want to try some different moonshines? This is the place. The strawberry moonshine is a little syrup-like, but it's very interesting with almost 2 different flavors. Next time I'll will try something different, but this is a great place to give it a shot.  The motif is based on the old ridge runner moonshine days, so polish off the General Lee and get on down to the restaurant, ya hear?"}
{"text":"Our date night dinner was excellent. BBQ for 2 with the cauliflower steak add was quite tasty as was the cobbler dessert. Only downer was the $8 pints of Bells Two hearted. Yes you read that right $8. That might be the most I've ever paid for a pint of beer in 7 years in AZ aside from a ballgame or concert. Fix the outrageous drink prices and you'd get 5 from this yelper on the meal and service."}
{"text":"Below average burgers. Service was good. Drinks were good. Paying 3 dollars to add fries was a high ripoff. 7 fries for 3 dollars was a sim. I would advise you try somewhere else. Very expensive for what you get and not that great of food"}
{"text":"This is certainly a favorite spot. Good friendly service. Great drinks. However, the smoked meats are divine. Cooked to perfection. Good selection of sides. The smoked brisket is to die for."}
{"text":"This is a cool place. And i use cool like an old beatnik, cool dadio, you dig? The atmosphere is dark and moody with smooth sweet jazz over the speakers. The smell of BBQ wafts into you nose as you enter. The beer selection is small but varied. I had a vanilla porter with a glass of apple pie moonshine which is the most amazibg thing ive ever tasted. It is apple pie in a jar. The service is relaxed and friendly. I had the beef brisket with smashed potatoes. It falls apart in your mouth and has a deep smokey flavor. The bbq sauce is thick but not overpowering. Adds a nice sweet compliment to the smokieness. There are two things that keep this review from 5 stars. One is the temperature inside the restaurant. Its a little warm. The other issue is the chairs. So much money is spent on the decor and all the chaira are metal and they feel cheap. Go with wood! Great place for a date though. Id highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've started traveling more thus last year and am always looking for some good BBQ and I sure found it here. But not just that... The Moonshine is something you have to try and get this... They have a flight you can try.   I came here with 2 coworkers after finding that it was one of the top 10 ranked places in the 5 mile area we were in. It sounded the best and I was in the mood for some MEAT!!! When we arrived I asked the staff what their favorite was and that resounding answer was the prime rib. You'd think it would be ribs or brisket (which they all said was great but... It was nothing like the prime rib). So I along with one other had the prime rib and had all three BBQ sauces on the side (original, dr. Pepper, and spicy).   While waiting for the main course we tried a brisket taco on their happy hour menu ($3) which gave us a glimpse of how wonderful the brisket truly is and swallowed it down with the Moonshine sampler. Woah!! What??? A moonshine sampler? Yeah, they have 4 house made moonshines and also serve old Smokey and a couple others. With help from our amazing waitress Brandiss (like Candice) we got the house made apple pie (sweet and clearly the best), the house made strawberry (would never know there was alcohol in it), and the old Smokey Orange and the blackberry (blackberry came in a close second to the Apple pie). Totally worth it. Get the sampler!!!  When the prime rib showed up it...was... Huge... It was easily over and inch thick and covered a third of the plate. There was a bowl of au jus and a small dish of a mild horseradish sauce. But honestly you didn't need to eat it with any of those. It was perfectly pink, dripping with flavor, tender as could be, and with the best BBQ rub. It's smoked for 8 hours during the day and so it's limited in quantity so don't miss it before it's gone each night. I will say though... You should try it with the spicy BBQ sauce. It takes it to a whole new level.   Last quick notes... Get the fricken prime rib!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, Awesome food and moonshine. We started with the bacon  board ended with the BBQ sampler for two and a side of asparagus, deliciously succulent."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! All the food we had here was too notch!! Bootleg burger was fantastic! Can't wait to come back !!"}
{"text":"This place... Is... FANTASTIC. Amazing food. Stellar service. Sexy ambiance. It's all you could ask for. I highly recommend the brisket nachos for an appetizer and the sampler as the entree (w/ a plus one). And the moonshine Apple Brandy Shandy is literally apple pie liquor. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Bacon Board is from heaven. Moonshine Flight is from heaven. Heaven is made out of Apple Pie moonshine. The only problem with the short ribs is my own fault - I didn't order more.  Service is phenomenal. Lauren was a perfect server.  I would like to meet the person who gave this place a one star review in a public arena so that the masses can enjoy watching me rip his larynx out with my bare hands while they enjoy some delicious ribs provided by Bootleggers.  I'll be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with some of my girl friends. They wanted to watch football games and they had them on the tv in front of the bar. John, the bartender, was very friendly and helpful with what to order. I am a Vegetarian so he recommended some veggie tacos that were delicious! He made us feel like regulars and will definitely be back to see John!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere. Had phenomenal service from our waiter. Love this place! Highly recommend pork belly tacos!"}
{"text":"I had my hopes up for this one based on an episode on the travel channels Food Paradise.  I was extremely disappointed, even more disappointed that I took my good friends here to be embarrassed.  The service - Very slow, the restaurant wasn't even half full on a Saturday night. This was not a good sign. It took 25 minutes for 3 appetizers! Our server was not very informative and never came to check on us not once! She took our order, my friends ordered drinks and apps while I was still on my way there. She brought out drinks did not explain the moonshine flights to my friends. I knew about it from the show and ordered it. My friends were like hey she didn't tell us about that. The apple pie was delicious the others were not good fruit punch, raspberry. Another flavor my friend wanted to try was unavailable, he was told after our server went to the bar and the bartender told her they were sure if they would be carrying it anymore. UGH we had to track her down to place our food order don't know where she had been we didn't see her anywhere. When I got up to look for her the hostess stopped me and asked if I needed something I said yes our server to take our orders. A minute later we placed our order and disappeared for another 30 minutes! Another person was bringing out the food and then she came by and said is every ok?  My friends asked for a couple things she went and got them, but forgot that 2 of us had asked for drink refills. I had to ask the hostess for refills. There was no sense of urgency or attentiveness. I've had better service at McDonalds.   The food -  Hubby and I split the BBQ sampler for 2 - The brisket was very dry, the pulled pork was ok it wasn't very moist either, the ribs were chewy, the link was good, the turkey stole the show moist tender and very flavorful.  The boot dumpling app was ok I had high expectations.  The roasted cauliflower steak was bland it's described with whisky onions and cheddar. The onions and the cheddar was also bland.  Overall not a good experience, I felt it was overpriced for the quality and quantity. The server we had and possibly the cook that was working that night both need to seek other employment in my opinion. NOT GOOD."}
{"text":"Well, i have been coming here for about a year and juat downloaded the yelp app. Makes sense my first review be about my favorite date place, Bootleggers. Bacon board, bbq sampler, and the apple pie moonshine.  Always worth always good. The Bartender Kiki and bartender Paul are my favorite bartenders. Boyfriend loves sazerac's they make. I completely recommend this place for friends hanging out or just needing a nice place to relax."}
{"text":"As someone with many dietary restrictions, dining out can be a challenge. The staff at Bootleggers makes me feel comfortable and taken care of every time I dine there. They are super attentive to my limitations and reassure me each time I order that the chef is aware of my allergens and is preparing my food accordingly. There staff is so warm, helpful, and genuine. The food is good too (love the salmon tacos and cottage fries) - but the service is truly exceptional, and that is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Bootleggers kicked ass! Despite what some of the other reviews that were written, our group had a great experience with dinner, drinks, and friendly waitstaff.   The bacon board was on point. A must! I mean, where else have you seen a restaurant offer a bacon board?! 5 types of bacon, mustard, cheese bread, pickles are perfect for sharing with a group of friends. Portions are ridiculous-I shared the BBQ sampler with 2 other friends and it was plenty of food including brisket, pork, hot link, ribs, turkey, and cole slaw. Not sure what was up with the turkey slices-it was like it came straight out of a lunchable box. I would also avoid the tortilla and go with the bun. Sides of smoked sweet corn and cauliflower steak were really flavorful.  By far the best cocktails I had all weekend! Our server surprised me with the bartender special which consisted of a no-too-sweet house infused blueberry bourbon concoction. Great for day drinking by the pool! Don't pass up Smokehouse!"}
{"text":"We've visited Scottsdale several times and this was our first visit to Bootleggers, we were blown away by the quality of the food and the service.  Kenin our waiter was the best!  We had the prime rib, salmon, mac & cheese, steak tartar, asparagus and porch green chili tacos and kale salad.  There was not any food left on our plates!   Every dish we ordered exceeded our expectations.  The local brewed Scottish Blonde Ale was very tasty and the apple pie moonshine was good. For desert we tried the peach cobbler and were equally impressed.  We will definitely make Bootleggers a regular stop for us when we are in town."}
{"text":"I travel all over the country for work. We stopped in to Bootleggers looking for a good meal. The bartenders, Kyle & John suggested the smoked prime rib... WOW ! The best prime rib I have had in a long time ! Great atmosphere, Great meal... I will be back !"}
{"text":"Great location, cute outside patio. Friendly servers rounded out the atmosphere to make a really nice experience. Now the food. We had the lunch combination with our choice of 2 meats + 2 flour tortillas and coleslaw. We chose  the brisket (meh) , and pulled pork (delicious), fried dumplings (meh),  the asparagus (overly charred in my opinion), and the macaroni (best thing we ate)!  I'm not sure if I would come back. It was a little expensive and there are so many other places to try nearby. Overall a good place to try!"}
{"text":"Can't believe y'all enjoy this. The kitchen is disgusting. Take a look.  There are flies everywhere. They land on the food and you still get served that stuff. They can't keep any management consistency because they are failing. Please ask to see the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place was a big surprise...with Big portions.   I had the smoked turkey and I like turkey but this turkey was as good as any smoked turkey you have anywhere. It was moist, it was craved perfectly, and it was delicious. The sauce accompanying it was again, excellent... Not to thick and not too runny.   My side was cole slaw and added an additional side.. The cauliflower steak...cauliflower with carmilized onions with cheddar grilled. Oh my, a great combo.   Finally ... Live music ( a little loud) and incredibly well priced.   So as they say in the west or southwest...vamos  GO!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the ambience, our server, my whiskey sour and the BBQ! Had the sampler platter and it was perfect to share with my husband. The ribs were awesome!"}
{"text":"Ordered tacos which were super yummy, about street taco size (3 came with the order $12). Any sides are additional. Wait staff really friendly and nice atmosphere. Very clean."}
{"text":"Holy cow, amazing!!  We had the bacon board as an appetizer (totally worth the fairly steep price tag of $24), and everything the group had was beyond amazing!  Ribs, brisket, pulled pork, turkey, everything!  Apple pie moonshine tasted just like pie, and the fresh fruit cobbler a la mode was the icing on the cake.  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Speechless. Food was authentic and off the charts. The \"southern pride\" smoker alluded me. How can I achieve this taste at home? I don't think I ever will be able to. The ambiance as well as the little touchs were amazing but the food was my favorite.  I definitely will be back soon"}
{"text":"\"You only have one chance to make a good first impression\" is a common saying and Bootleggers did not.    My experience was negative and so brief, I would have been fine with just sending Phoenix mgt an email.   But as you can see by the photos I have attached, other than a phone #, there is no way to contact them, either by Facebook, Twitter or email. Which suggests STRONGLY to me that they don't want to hear for me, from us.  As I've gotten older I've stopped eating most cold cuts. For example, I don't care if it's Boar's Head or Subway, shiny turkey is fake turkey.  So I've taken to going to barbecue restaurants and getting smoked or barbecued turkey; it's real turkey. When I passed Bootleggers on Shea and noticed it for the first time I made it a point to put on the list to check out, especially for the turkey.   I visited Monday, Nov 1st, right about 4pm. (And before I say anything, any of these cited players/employees could be just employees or  managers (or the owners which would only make it worse.)  The bartender, a heavyset kid, didn't greet me, didn't smile at me, did not make eye contact, didn't even acknowledge me until I acknowledged him. All that being said, how was he selected?  With no personality at all, which candidates did he beat out?  The ones who don't speak?  And can you please put it in the bootleggers employee manual that they're in the hospitality business?  I ordered a beer and asked if I could try the turkey. You would've thought I asked this bartender for a $500 personal loan. Two women who were either bartenders or servers hanging around the right side of the bar were equally unfriendly; God only knows, I fear one of them was forced to bring me a slice of turkey.  Had to ask for BBQ sauce...wouldn't you think...oh never mind. These people have never sniffed anticipation.   The turkey was ok, good not great, but the atmosphere crushing, the friendliness nonexistent --  why would I come home back?  Remember the scene in A Clockwork Orange where they prop open Malcolm McDowell's eyes and make him watch violent films in order to create anti-violent feelings?  Likewise, I would force the staff I met at Bootleggers, eyes forced open, to watch 20 episodes of \"Cheers\" because even Norm was treated better than I was. IT'S THE HOSPITALITY BUSINESS!  FRIENDLINESS COUNTS?  You only have one chance to make a good first impression and Bootleggers did not.  In spades."}
{"text":"Unpretentious, good comfort food at a reasonable price.  Kale salad was fresh and crisp and all I hoped for. Very tender ribs (though one of us felt it needed a touch more salt and pepper).  Our server John was very attentive. It was nice of the chef to allow us to order the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes as a side, which came with today's special even though we passed on that except for this enticing side dish.   Likely to return; John said there's also a sister restaurant in Old Scottsdale; that doesn't appear to be on yelp ... we actually drove up from there!"}
{"text":"Smoked prime rib, goat cheese mashed potatoes, guacamole with pomegranate seeds? Yes yes and yes. Service was great but food was phenomenal. Dreaming of my next meal here!"}
{"text":"They brought us in out of the heat and sat us in the dining room very quickly. All of the food was wonderful, my favorites were the coleslaw, which I never eat, and the mac & cheese. Service was excellent food even better! Highly recommend the sampler for two or four. Plenty of food!"}
{"text":"While in Scottsdale, my husband was craving some BBQ and we happened to stumble upon Bootleggers for lunch. It's got a modern rustic vibe, and since I'm totally into that kind of design right now, I was digging the place right off the bat. It wasn't very busy and we were given a table near a window with a nice view of Old Town.   I wasn't particularly hungry and I'm not as big of a BBQ fan as my hubby, so I went with a simple beet salad. This \"simple\" salad was actually quite refreshing and loaded with red and golden beets, quinoa, dried cherries, goat cheese, and topped with an orange vinaigrette. My husband went with a brisket and pulled pork combo served with cole slaw and tortillas... you know, in case you're craving a BBQ burrito. He really enjoyed his meal as well and said the brisket was *almost* as good as his momma's. Now that's a compliment!  Our server was spot on the entire time and was really helpful in offering a few tips and suggestions for our trip. He even brought us some apple pie moonshine to try at the end of our meal. Just hearing the word \"moonshine\" makes me think of drinking something that tastes like rubbing alcohol. How wrong I was though! This sweetened version tasted like a dessert, and the fact that it was served in cute little mason jars made me like it even more. :)  So next time you've got a hankerin' for some BBQ while in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, head on over to Bootleggers for some brisket and moonshine. Yee-Haw!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food but I should never have to wait for the bartender to finish her personal and very angry yelling phone call to get service."}
{"text":"Was really craving some barbecue when we decided to try Bootleggers BBQ the food was mediocre to say the least are kids meala came out over fried and burnt had to send back to the kitchen the dressing on my salad wasn't as the one described on the menu the booth  were filthy the tufted seats had food crumbs filled to the top to the point where my niece was digging the food out and eating it ...gross...muat have been bad night in the kitchen...sad.we came so far to eat... everyone at our table underwhelmed by our meals..wvwn cocktails got sent back horrible"}
{"text":"VERGY good BBQ! I can't believe I haven't been here before. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted, so I'l have to come back and try the others."}
{"text":"Went last night with friends and the kids so we saw a pretty good assortment of the menu and service as there were seven of us. It was restaurant week so a couple of folks had the special, a taco assortment that they liked. I had the pulled pork, very good. My son had the beef brisket which was quite fatty so just ok. I heard the short rib was delicious. The kids chicken tenders my daughter gave a thumbs down, too crispy and too much breading she said. The brownie got thumbs up from all the kids, the peach cobbler that my wife and I split, well we left half of it in the bowl so get the brownie. Service was very good and it's a fun atmosphere. We'll be back for sure and just modify a few choices."}
{"text":"Cudos for bringing more Mojo to 32nd and Shea.. I have street cred when it comes to this area, My mom used to drag me around the AJ Bayless in a cart when it was the only supermarket in North East Phoenix, I remember having my tenth birthday at the Dairy Queen in that shopping center after a great night at Legend City.. I had my first Cheesesteak at Uncle Sams in 1979.. I also remember the shattering of this area when the 51 came in and closed down 60% of the businesses in this area, so the Bootleggers location is the little engine that could.. I love the fact that Uncle sams still thrives, the addition of Shea 32, and Sula are great as well.. But alas.. my thoughts on Bootleggers:) If you get anything.. Get the Nachos... There must have been two whole avacodos on these beautiful mounds of chips! The PBLTA was figgin ridiculous.. I love how Lori expresses how expensive this place is.. Umm Lori HELLO..Stop comparing this to the abortion known as Area 51.. The other restaurants went out of business serving the same ole Budlight, fried wings, and Sliders, ever other Sports bar in the city serves.. This is way more like a Gastro Pub, The food was reasonably priced.. (Although a Happy Hour would be stellar!) Oh yeah.. Ten bucks for a burger is not expensive.. Just sayin."}
{"text":"This is my go to Bbq right now. The nacho flat is amazing, the bacon board, brisket, just everything!!!!!! The absolute only thing I would change is to have the burger served on a regular dish instead of the wood board. I get it but it's already so messy without the delicious sauce dripping off the board onto the table. Regardless you should order the burger with fries. You won't regret it!!!! Vibe is casual but can be romantic and trendy and they have interesting happy hour deals too!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, the food was good. I had a pulled pork sandwich and it was great. Had some weird chip looking things they called French fries were a miss now that I think of it. Got there and were seating and had to wait about 15 mins before a server showed up.  Nice guy and he did not mess up our order in a way. But it took foooorever to get our food.  At least 30 mins maybe longer. One of our party had asked to be seated at an open table because the bar stools at the high table that was the only thing available when we arrived so we were told. Our request was ignored as we asked our server and never got an answer. Within 20 mins 4 people went and sat at one table and another party at the second so that when we realized we were ignored. Old men with bad backs and bar stools don't mix well.  Anyway, based on our overall experience the likelyhood of a second visit is quite slim."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Service was SO slow. I had to flag down our server for drink refills three different times and then to get our bill. The food was not very good either. We started with the bacon board. It was nothing to rave about. My father in law ordered the turkey leg and it was tough and didn't have very much flavor (I tried it). He said he had better at a state fair. His girlfriend got the salmon and said it was pretty good.  I got the grilled cheese with bacon & tomato. It was dry and the cheese wasn't melted onto the bread. I forget what my husband got, something with fried cole slaw, but he said it was just ok.   Then the bill came - definitely not worth $117!  Highly unlikely that we'll be back."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? My husband I just went to lunch and it took forever to get our food. There were only a few people in there and we couldn't even get our beer within 10min. The brisket is still fantastic but we won't be back due to TERRIBLE service."}
{"text":"Saw this location on Check Please and wanted to give it a try. Especially wanted the Jack Daniels Brownie, as it turned out it was a chocolate cake they make to order with a scoop of ice cream. Nothing special. We had the red brick chicken which sounded good on the menu but was basically tasteless and came with two bites of brocoli and potatos. Ambience was good as was the parking. It cost $70 for the two of us which was about $20 to much for what they have to offer."}
{"text":"I think this is a hit or miss kind of place. I have had their ribs in the past and they were good. This time we ordered some specials and I was reminded not to order non BBQ items. We had some soup with a pile of \"brisket scraps\" in the middle that was so full of rub/salt that we had trouble eating it. They served it with a sliced pretzel roll that was soggy. The hot wings were so smoked that they tasted just like turkey jerky, if you like that. Service was good and the place is really well laid out, bar area open and dining room more romantic. I don't remember there being a happy hour, either.  So. stick to the smoker for BBQ and you will be fine. Don't say I didn't warn you otherwise."}
{"text":"1 year later and still one of my favorites !! Every bite or drink of everything I've ordered is mouth watering good !!!  Definitely give the shrimp grits appetizer  a try ! You will never have grits like this anywhere !"}
{"text":"Started out with the Nachos.  Did not like the shredded beef on top.  The  wedge salad was mediocre. I got the Beef Brisket which was the best part of the meal.  The atmosphere was ok for a restaurant in a strip mall but the lighting was low. Unfortunately that leaves me wondering in it's intentional to hide and unclean facility.  Too many other better smokehouses in the phoenix area to go to.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Food is really pretty good I can't lie, but the management seriously sucks. They are so rude to their employees I feel so bad. A table next to me had asked their server to come back in like 20-30 minutes so they could talk and enjoy drinks before they ordered. I went to the bathroom and on my way out overheard the manager accusing the server of neglecting the table (the server had been there and back again to refill drinks and waters). Really weird and uncomfortable vibes. Asked where the old manager was and was told they were no longer with them. The new manager was so cocky and implied that it was a good thing he was manager now (so unprofessional, especially to customers who liked the last manager). In the same evening, when walking past the kitchen saw the manager drinking a freaking cocktail while on his phone. Restaurants busy, servers needed help. A friend of mine from school worked there and said two of her coworkers were fired over text and email. Won't spend my money here again. Hopefully a bbq restaurant just as yummy food and moral and ethical and respectful values come around."}
{"text":"I got the pork belly sandwich. It was cooked well. it was tender, but had no flavor. Really bland. That was only one sandwich, maybe they can do better, but for now they are sitting at a 2. What also kept them down was the server had no clue about anything on the menu. More education for the servers about the food would be better."}
{"text":"This place is off the charts on flavor and creativity as well. I never ate hard boiled eggs at a restaurant, but their Hickman Beet Hard Boiled eggs were a surprise - ordered two plates. The gourmet tacos were out of this world....best Happy hour in AZ  Thanks Vegas Foodie"}
{"text":"Had a pulled pork sandwich which (for them) I, unfortunately, make the best ones, so I know how my pork should taste.  Theirs is just adequate.  I say this because I found lumps of meat in my sandwich which was not chopped up or pulled as it should be.  Also, they are kinda scrimpy with the meat there.  Taste was okay but nothing exceptional at all.  It rates a \"meh\" from me sadly. Served with some home made chips which were ok, but nothing spectacular. The staff and service was great, the place is cute with it's little fresh sunflower at each table...but the food, to me, was just average. I'd give it another try, but I'm not holding my breath that this will rate a 5 star next time or ever."}
{"text":"Love the brisket nachos and bacon plate! The apple pie moonshine is the only homemade moonshine but it's amazing. Wish they expanded that selection. Cool spot that we enjoyed even though the bartender was stand-off-ish."}
{"text":"Love the food and people. The new guy Paul is great with people and helping people out."}
{"text":"This is our second time to Bootleggers.  First time for lunch this past Thursday and we enjoyed the bacon board, the guacamole, the cauliflower purée and pork tacos.  James was our server.  He was very nice and professional.  Saturday night we went back for dinner around 8 pm.  Katy greeted us at the door and allowed us to chose where we wanted to sit.  She was very sweet.  My date order the special which was meatloaf wrapped with bacon and cheese served with a tortilla.  Tasty.  I order the Scottish salmon on forbidden rice. Absolutely Delicious.  Just enough food and priced just right.  We sampled an apple cinnamon moonshine.  Tasty.  Our server was John.  Also very nice and very professional.  Looking forward to going there again.  I love the atmosphere.  The dining area is beautiful and inviting."}
{"text":"Third time here and it's always great.  The wife and I sit at the bar.  Great Pork and the moonshine is outstanding.  The apple pie one will give you interesting dreams.  Favorite BBQ besides Kansas City."}
{"text":"I love their brisket tacos. So good. The Apple Brandy Shandy is amazing. I cannot have just one. The bacon board is a must try. And you have to have some pork belly. Not much here that isn't great! Service was good too!"}
{"text":"found this place on the list for restaurants during AZ restaurant week. we didn't do the special but I wanted to try this place. any place that makes their own moonshine I have to try. The guy waiting on us was a trip, he was a little rude and brash, it bothered some but I didn't care.  I ordered the special of the day, smoked prime rib.  It was one of the best prime rib ive ever had and possibly the best ive ever had.  I unfortunately didn't get to try the house made moonshine but I will be back to try it and maybe on a sunday again to get the prime rib."}
{"text":"Awesome awesomeness of the smoked meatdom. I can sum up this review in the first two words.  These guys know what there doing in the smoking field. The bacon platter is porky madness. The lunch combo of sausage and brisket is amazing.   I wish I could knock out brisket like they do. Tender, moist and pulls apart with just a tad of effort. This is more then a green egg smoker crew, everything they make is excellent. Smoke turkey, pork belly and my all time favorite pork belly tacos.  I'm hooked"}
{"text":"The food was darn good but the service was fantastic!  Josh was funny and attentive and handling a number of tables with ease.  Not sure where Bootleggers found him but I highly recommend they keep him as he totally made the experience worth repeating."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 5 because they have great food but the service was HORRIBLE. The most unfriendly server with a complete attitude, she clearly did not want to be there. We finished our food and 30 minuets later we received the bill after asking a different server. When we asked if they were super busy (didn't look like it at all) she said \"no not really, it will be later if you guys want to come back tonight\" I said no it took 30 minutes to leave and she said \"well\" and walked away. Service is what makes the experience of a restaurant and as much as I enjoyed the ribs, I won't be paying for that kind of treatment again. The worst part, everyone around us (who had ordered drinks) were getting great service."}
{"text":"Service was great, very friendly. French dip was so fatty we had to pull half the meat off the sandwiches. Fries were awesome!! Worth the upcharge. The wings were ok. They advertise $5 wings but on the bill they were $9. I'm sure a simple mistake but with the bad sandwiches just left a bad impression. The decor is awesome and I would imagine this place would be great for groups. Another guest with us order the cobb salad and even though it was served with about a handful of iceberg lettuce he said he enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Driving North on 51 at lunchtime my husband remembered an article he had read in the Scottsdale Republic Magazine about this restaurant at 51 and Shea. We aren't in this area often and took advantage of trying it since we were right there anyway. Being an ex-Kansas City person, he loves BBQ. We looked at the menu and the chicken sandwich (not BBQ) sounded so good (he says it was) he had that instead.  Another reviewer is correct, just the aroma of barbeque in the parking lot is strongly tempting. (Too bad they can't  blanket the area with the smell, it'd be great for business.)  Don't eat meat so I had the grilled fish sandwich and was quite satisfied with it.  Our server, Nathan was new on the job, think  he said 1st day, but he handled 4 or 5 tables handily.  New restaurant, only open two months, but I would like to see them succeed."}
{"text":"Bootleggers BBQ is the bomb!  Went in to grab some food late (9:30). Kitchen closes at 10 but establishment closes at 11.   Started with the bacon board. It seems a bit pricey but WOW. The variety was great. My favorite was jalapeño. The little pickles were yummy too.   On to dinner. I had the wedge salad. Who goes to a BBQ place and orders a wedge salad?  Me ok. I love a good wedge salad. This one was very good. I also knew my man would share his brisket and mac and cheese so salad was cool.   The brisket was amazing. So tender. The spiced BBQ sauce was so good neither of us even tried the regular one. The mac and cheese was good. I just am completely spoiled by another establishments mac and cheese so I'm always somewhat disappointed. It's good. Try it.   A big shout out to Brianna our waitress.  Super friendly knowledgeable cute girl. She is an asset to the business.   I look forward to another visit here and I'm having the brisket tacos!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, server was informative and pleasant AND efficient. Try the brisket, macaroni and cheese, the red smashed goat cheese potato thingies, and the pan seared salmon. All A+  The deviled eggs are clever and unique, worth a taste, but not a must-have.   For the bourbon cocktailer, the Capone Sazerac was great!  Go here. Eat food. Leave happy."}
{"text":"We smelled this place down the street and couldn't resist despite our original intentions to go for Mexican food. As fellow meat smokers, we had to try the smoked prime rib. It's not something we've smoked nor do we see it on menu's often, so it was a must-have, and we didn't regret it! That night, the chef said the prime rib was more medium than medium rare, but we still thought it was incredible, especially the seasoning-packed crust. DROOL.   This was the star of the show though we were equally impressed with the brisket tacos and 3 homemade sauces. We make our own BBQ sauce at home and were humbled to admit we thought these rivaled or slightly surpassed our own.  We enjoyed the outside ambiance with a nice view of the outdoor smoker. It's rare we give 5 stars all around but our server was fantastic and friendly as well. A great way to kick off our vaca, and we're happy to brag about our experience here to our co-workers and friends. From a fellow BBQ person, this is a must do in Old Town!"}
{"text":"*sniff sniff* found the huge brick smoker in the back by the patio. Genuine.  Came in 2ish on a Sunday and found all patrons glued to the football on the tv's. Also found out its happy hour all day, too!  Shared a brisket entree with beans and grilled asparagus. Brisket smokey and soft, used a fork to cut it up. The beans were like a thick dark bean chili with a bit of heat to it. Its not your sweet tomato pork and bean type. The brisket was served with a delightful slaw and hot flour tortillas. It came with a side of tangy bbq sauce.  Free street and lot parking nearby."}
{"text":"So so despite other  reviews Got the bacon board based on recommendations on yelp 8 slices of bacon for 24 bucks The fixing's are mustard and two other sauces and 5 tiny pickles So in satisfying  But the cauliflower stake was amazing  Wings good  Skip the bacon board"}
{"text":"Saw on  Check Please and looked special. Reality was nothing special and average food. Looked forward to the Jack Daniels brownie which was not very good. Overall just a bar that cost about 20 dollars more than average. The bacon sampler costs $24, seems like a lot. I do not recommend"}
{"text":"We walked in at about 4pm on a Saturday after dropping the baby off to Grandma's. Yes, we were eating at 4. No, I don't care that you think we're old people because it was DATE NIGHT!  Anyway, the place had probably two tables of couples, and a half full bar. The host welcomed us and we asked for a table for 2. He smiled and looked at the sheet of tables in front of him. We stood for a beat. Then two beats. Then another employee came over and asked if we'd like to be seated? The host explained to her \"I was about to seat them, but I'm trying to find a table that doesn't already have a reservation.\" Holy crap, that's a lot of reservations. We were finally brought to our high top table and ordered some drinks on happy hour. Yes, happy hour is every day of the week! From 3-6pm.  Husband's Bathtub Gin was tasty, refreshing and cool. I loved my Lonestar Mule in a chilled copper mug (I had a mule in a glass the other day at an unnamed bar and would not recommend it). As much as he wanted to get an appetizer, I was starved and just wanted real food. Sorry, bacon board.   I had our sweet server decide for me between the St. Louis Ribs and the Short Ribs. She highly recommended the short ribs, so Husband got the St. Louis Ribs (next time we've got to try their burger though). Not long later, our meals came out. Mine with a side of grilled cauliflower steak and his with a side of mac and cheese, both with cole slaw. Yum! I took a bite of my short ribs and... was a bit disappointed. My dad made incredible short ribs, very moist and full of flavor. And, while these were very flavorful, they were a bit dry. Our server came by to check on us and I let her know I wasn't thrilled. She didn't whisk my food away like most servers, she gave me a quick solution, which I fully loved: BBQ sauce. Yes please! So she ran off to get three different flavors and, upon her return, the manager, Jacob, was right in front of her. He asked me about my short ribs and apologized that they weren't up to par and insisted he bring out a new one.   Jacob let me keep my cauliflower topped with cheese and the most amazing whiskey onions (Husband is obsessed with those whiskey onions) and took my dish. In the meantime, I tried Husband's St. Louis Ribs. SO GOOD! I love the BBQ sauce and the ribs don't fall off the bone and I'm not mad about it. Incredibly tasty.   Jacob came back out and apologized. He found that all the short ribs were a little dry, so he 86'd them from the menu. We were impressed he cared enough to check, then pull, a less than stellar item off the menu off of one customer's minor complaint. He very kindly offered to bring out anything else from the menu and suggested the Beef Brisket. Okay, I'll have that! Best.Decision.Ever. It melted in my mouth. I was sad when I was full and couldn't eat any more. I did bring the leftovers to my mom and she immediately began making plans to bring her friend to Bootleggers!   TL;DR. Great specialty drinks on daily happy hour. Problem with meal was successfully resolved by Jacob, the manager. To die for brisket meal and cauliflower side.   Eat here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First of all, 5+ stars for the service we had the other night from James! We were a large group and though we're not difficult, it can be a bit like herding cats to get us to focus enough to order drinks and food. He was funny and laid back the whole time and didn't get a single thing wrong.   As for the food, it was satisfying but definitely not the best BBQ I've had. The brisket is supposedly one of the most popular dishes on the menu, but I found it a bit dry, and the cole slaw on the side a bit too watery and flavorless. Still, it was a huge portion and very filling. I also had the sweet corn which came with an interesting cholula sauce on the side, and others at my table had the Bacon Board, which was definitely photo-worthy.   Oh, and though they obviously specialize in meat, the vegetarians in our group still had options to choose from that actually looked tasty!  It's a big space that was able to be flexible with a last minute large group reservation, and close to lots of other restaurant and bar options. It's a casual and easy option and it hit the spot on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Because the food is so great I continue to come back and I must say the service is getting much better. The staff had always been friendly but at my last visit, the service was fast too."}
{"text":"I chose Bootleggers for my birthday dinner which is always a fun family event. I did so because of the reviews on \"Check Please\". On the good side, I loved the interiors; a little dark but great design & atmosphere. The food overall was good too. Our favorites; French dip, brisket (any style) and the Bootlegger Burger. The disappointing items are unfortunately a big deal to me; employees were smoking out front by the front entrance and the service was slow. I would assume know on site management. I would go back and give it another try..."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Barbecue sauce was to \"ketchupy\"  side werent good either.  Maybe I need to go back, my feeling is that it is a good place to drink bc they have \"moonshine\", but I was not impressed.  If the reviews still hold at 4 stars in another 6 months I may have to go back...always an optimist."}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave Bootleggers another try.  It looks like this restaurant has made it past its learning curve and finally figured things out.  The service has greatly improved and the menu has been properly chiseled down. Also, the popularity of trying the new place has worn off, so Bootleggers isn't even close to being as packed as it was nearly a year ago.  The smaller menu may mean less choices, but it finally focuses on what Bootleggers appears to be all about. The smoked meats. The meats all come with a tortilla or bun, coleslaw, and a side. With a price ranging between $16 and $32, you still get plenty of food for a good price. Besides, it's not like any of the smaller cheaper items that disappeared in the last year are sorely missed. If I hadn't looked at my previous review, I'd never have even remembered what I had.  And don't forget to get a Local Dine (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) before heading to Bootleggers. The website has a $50 for $25 gift certificate for Bootleggers. Unlike most web deals, it covers alcohol. So enjoy a moonshine flight while you're at it."}
{"text":"Food and out server were excellent and could have been a fun place to have a few drinks. BUT the other server standing in the floor repeatedly complaining to anyone who would listen about having to do her side work alone took our great experience and left up headed to another establishment"}
{"text":"Live close by and normally this place is a consistent go-to for good food and good service.  Tonight was a disappointment.  Three different items on our order were missing with no apology.  Beer came up right away from bartender but waitress let it sit there for  almost 10 min even though she only had 3 tables under her watch.  Also, not sure what the deal is with the food but the chili, cornbread, brisket, and pulled pork were not nearly as good as they normally are and certainly not worth the average $18 per plate for the main entrees.  Disappointing.  Will most likely give this place another try but really hoping whatever the deal was tonight doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"Just had an outstanding meal here.   Chicken Wings were great appetizers.   11 to an order.   Get the traditional style.   Kale salad was very fresh.. Kale has to be fresh to serve raw.  Pulled pork was not greasy at all,  always a good sign.   Very friendly staff.   Highly recommended.   Great beer selection changes often. Happy Hour 4 to 6."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch yesterday. Decided to try the wings. WOW-We had a dozen for $8. Great pric- Big drummers and only 1 flipper- The flover we had was the PBJ and the other was the Dijon BBQ- They were really great an we had them grilled. Had a sideof slaw- good and the  4 cheese mac and cheese- very rich.  It has been really nice redecorated and we sure will be back. . also killer martinis.   So glad this place has been revamped to a nice place but not really pricey for the area."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! The meat was amazing. We got the sampler plate for 4 and I'm so glad we did so we could try everything. It was all delicious. The deviled eggs are expensive, but totally worth it. It was empty on a Friday night, so I hope it will continue to make it. Don't let that deter you!"}
{"text":"The PBLT was voted best sandwich in Phoenix in 2013 by the readers of the Phoenix New Times. I don't know if the recipe changed since then, or if 2013 represented a dark time in the Phoenix sandwich scene...but the PBLT I had last night wasn't even the best sandwich I ate yesterday evening and it's competition was a premade chicken salad sandwich from Safeway.  My experience with pork belly has been that pork belly is tender, juicy, and flavorful. The pork belly here was not particularly tender, nor juicy, nor flavorful.  It was cut in strips a little thicker than thick cut bacon and had the consistency and flavor of fatty, poorly cooked pork chop.   The tomato wasn't doing any work either. Rather than having a juicy, sweet tomato, this was just a mealy bland slice of red.   The only part of the sandwich that had any enjoyable taste was the aioli...which was also the last thing I was interested in tasting when I should have been wowed by the taste of tomato and pork belly.  Also, the chicken added to the beet salad was incredibly dry.  I realize that a PBLT and beet salad with chicken may not be in the wheelhouse of a BBQ joint, but if it's on the menu it should still be done well because now I probably won't be back to try any classic BBQ items."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick happy hour meeting with a co-worker at his suggestion. I was surprised to see the taps.... some of my favorite styles of beer, if not brewers that I recognize. Paul the bartender led me to a saison to start the session. My friend ordered food, I swore I did not have time but ended up getting some anyway.  I smoke meats and fish at home and think I am pretty damn good at it but this place was out of this world. I will be back again and again. Excellent vibe, great bartender and fantastic food."}
{"text":"My husband loves BBQ so we had to give it a try. We had reservations at 7 and were seated right away. Our server was great! She recommended the Bacon Board which was devoured by all except me ( I gave it up for lent). Nachos were also very good. There was 5 of us, each having different entrees and sides. We ordered the BLT, pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich and chicken, very generous portions and served hot. Food was delicious too. My 50/50 potato salad was good, Mac & cheese was good too. I would definitely recommend Bootleggers."}
{"text":"Bartender was nice and the beers were cold.  I came too late to sample the food but I did taste their apple pie moonshine which is savory for you dessert wine lovers.  They offer a cold orange blossom on draft and the glass was cold which cure my thirst.  The parking lot was a bit sketchy and not too lit at night. Aside from that, I definitely would come back for dinner."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant and was clearly thrilled with how great everything was. Give it a try. Great prices!!! Very nice great food"}
{"text":"We dined at Bootleggers before the Friday night crowd arrived.  The ambience is perfect either for a date, ladies night, or family dinner.  James, our outstanding waiter, steered us in the right direction and we ordered the sampler of every delectable meat (they were all super tasty, but the brisket was especially worthy of fighting over).  We also enjoyed the cauliflower steak and the mac & cheese.  The bar had a lot of selections but I wasn't drinking last night so I'll sample the moonshine on our return trip, and there will definitely be a return trip!  GO!"}
{"text":"I really love this place!  The service is always great, and the food is soooo good!  My fiancé and I brought my son here last week for his first time, and we weren't thinking he would eat anything because he's a typical picky kid, but he scarfed his entire burger down (which is more than I think I have ever seen him eat), and we've had to bring him back again this week!  He hasn't stopped talking about the food.  We had the tacos off of the happy hour menu, and YUM!  Every kind was delicious.  He also had a draft beer that was recommended by our server (good pick), and I had the moonshine (the apple pie is the best).  We will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Bootleggers gives a nod to the prohibition era with some cool cocktail and \"moonshine\" options. I quote moonshine because unless I get my white lightning in an unlabeled mason jar from a shady guy in Kentucky, I'm reluctant to give just any liquor such a notorious distinction. That term is being thrown around pretty loosely in recent years.   I tried one cocktail and it was good, but I have no recollection as to what it was called. I looked for it on their online menu without any luck. Milady tried the Blue Moon drink which was a bit heavy on the basil for me.   We started with the Bacon Board. An ensemble of delicious bacony meat delights. It's also served with some toasted bread pieces and a sweet onion jam that paired nicely with everything. It also comes with a house made mustard that actually consists of mustard seed, not yellow sludge, it was good and interesting. I'd never had actual mustard seed before.   I got the PBLT - Pork Belly Lettuce & Tomato with a side a mac and cheese for dinner. It was good, but by the time I got half way through the sandwich I had to call it quits. My stomach had begun revolting against the fatty pork products consumed on the Bacon Board, but it was worth it.  The mac and cheese was very good. It's served in the same cast iron skillet-thing in which it's cooked. I always like that look. It had lots of creamy cheese flavor unlike more subtle M&C I've tried recently.   On a non-food note, I really liked BL's modern rustic décor. Older looking wood siding and exposed brick. It had a slightly sophisticated yet natural feel and I'm not usually into much in the way of sophistication. There was a nice balance.  Bootleggers was a good find. I look forward to coming back to try more of their offerings after I recover from my current pork coma."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today! I was totally impressed with the food and the service! Brisket sandwich and the turkey melt I live the fries! Super tasty and hot! I do a lot of smoking all kinds of meat and I thought it was very good! Can't wait to go back and have smoked Prime Rib! Cameron was awesome! Took me out to the smokes and I was able to talk to the head smoker which I really enjoyed! I would totally recommend this place! I get a kick out of the stupid complaints I see people post! Stay home and do it yourself and see how well you do!!"}
{"text":"I had to take 1 star away because it's a bummer when 2 of the signature items are sold out. I made quite a journey to taste the beef brisket and ribs but they were both gone. As I searched the menu, nothing else really jumped out at me other than the fact that a turkey leg was $19. I get it that their meat is smoked in house for 8 hours, but Holy smokes! The menu was a little pricey, so I just went for the Nacos which were scrumptious and the 3 for 10 moonshine shots only because I had never had moonshine before. The homemade apple pie moonshine sample is what sold me. If I was a regular at Bootleggers, I'd be a lush for that shot! The 4 cheese mac and cheese was above average but I wouldn't need it again. I have high hopes for the beef brisket and ribs on my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have eaten here several times and the food is always excellent- especially when combined with their great craft cocktail and moonshine cocktail offerings. Bootleggers is always on my list when I get to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The bacon board was Amazing !!! 4 kinds of bacon, cheesy bread.  Gherkins and amazing pickled onions and grain mustard ! We looooovveedd it!"}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars I would. The food was really good, the menu was up to par for a regular BBQ joint. I guess I felt like it would be a little more unique. The decor is decent, but they could have done more with the inside. It has a little bit of a stale feeling inside. However, the food made up for it and I hope they make it. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is in a strip mall so the initial feel is more like a bar but after walking in the decor and ambiance is nice. I wasn't overly impressed with the experience though. We got the sampler platter and everything was prepared in a sweet BBQ sauce which made it all taste the same. The Mac n Cheese was great as was the apple pie moonshine. The server was nice but very slow, and we ended up having to ask multiple people for the same thing. Everything took a while and plates sat on the table well after we were finished, even after we had paid. Overall the experience was mediocre."}
{"text":"Drove by This \"hole-in-the-wall\" for nearly a year before a friend recommended we check it out.  Who KNEW??  Took the kids on a Saturday evening,  the intoxicating smell of REAL BBQ drifting into the parking lot lured us happily inside!  The house was busy but under control.  Once seated, orders were taken immediately.  The waitress & manager sincerely apologized they only had TWO infant highchairs & both were in use.  This made my dinner experience a bit rough, and eventually, I had to tote our 7 month old outside as a courtesy to other patrons.   The ambiance was casual but romantic, the food was delicious, the service was great.   Lets get a few more high chairs in the dining room and you'll get 5 stars from this mama!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! AMAZING nachos. Fun decor and atmosphere. Better for lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. The bootlegger burger was great. Possibly the best burger I've ever had. My wife had the beet salad and it was tasty, also.   As we were siting there they put 30lbs of beef into the smoker. I might have to come back for dinner.....  Cool spot, awesome decor, great vibe.   Anytime I'm in town this will be a destination."}
{"text":"We started with the \"boot dumplings\" which were very disappointing and a bit greasy. At $3 each, you'd think they would offer more than just a bite in a little bit of BBQ sauce!?  The meals were another story and VERY enjoyable.  I ordered the brisket tacos (3 HUGE to the plate) without any sides. These were by far the BEST taco's I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  The hubby enjoyed a full rack of ribs although he thought it a bit strange when instead of corn bread or beans, they were served alongside grilled tortillas & coleslaw. Must be a SW thing.  We actually went way out of our way to try this place and I'm glad we did although it was rather $$$.  It is Scottsdale after all..."}
{"text":"Had the brisket tacos and pork belly dumplings. They were quite flavorful. They had a live vocalist, which was very enjoyable to listen to while eating. Server was quick and very polite. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Have stopped in here twice now and see plenty more visits in our future. The first time was just a recon. Had a couple of drinks and some wings. The wings are very tasty, but we still long for the old dirty drummer wings...  Looking at the menu that night only convinced us that we had to come back and try a real meal.   Well, we returned with my son and it was actually quite a challenge to figure out what to try. Jeannie went with the pulled pork sandwich, while my son and I went for the PBLT...pork belly, lettuce, and tomato. AMAZING!  Our only complaint is that we couldn't eat more! I had half of Jeannie's sandwich and half of mine.  Both were incredible smoky eats! Tasted both the home fries and the homemade chips. Suggestion: go with the Chips and don't get filled on fries. Save as much room as possible for the exceptional barbecue.  Both visits were also marked by very attentive staff. This is not a cheap neighborhood eatery. Bootleggers is a place you will feel comfortable bringing friends and family....especially to impress with a great spot to eat.   Saw they are gearing for new happy hour options....can it get any better? :)"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has it all, smoky, yummy wings, moonshine, cocktails, brisket & BBQ. I think I'm in love...."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and LOVED it. All 4 of us loved everything. Cobb salad was amazing!!!!!  Highly recommend for lunch and can't wait to have brunch and dinner soon. Gotta give it a try. Nothing to possibly complain about here"}
{"text":"Came for a quick happy hour bite with my 12 yo, and ordered pulled pork slider (awesome!) and bbq wings (I would not order them again).  Friendly service and good selection of beers on draft.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Travel Channel and it looked so good. Definitely lived up to the hype, we got sampler platter which has a little of every (highly recommend) for first time. If in Old Town Scottsdale you must put this place on your foodie list!!!"}
{"text":"Bacon Board is phenominal. Great smoked meat items. Thumbs up. Good draft selection, awesome service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Pork Belly Dumplings are outstanding-- can't wait to try the PBL&T1"}
{"text":"We were very pleased with this restaurant. Our server, Jeremy was very courteous and made us feel welcome. The food and drinks were excellent! Definitely try one of the moonshine cocktails and the BBQ sampler entree."}
{"text":"Love this place don't know how we missed it for so long.  My only complaint is that I ordered the Veggie Tacos....taste was great but only 3 very SMALL tacos about 4 bites total...Pretty much mushrooms.  Also ordered the corn and it was a very small cob....very good but both items were hardly enough for lunch.  There were 9 in our party and only great reviews and very generous portions.  Food is very good!"}
{"text":"Would've given a 4-star rating had it not been for our last time in.  One of our absolute favorite neighborhood spots for sure with a Cobb Salad you have GOT to try complete with pork belly, of all things.  The demotion from 5 to 4 stars is a direct result of witnessing who would seem to be either the owner or GM standing behind the bar during service drinking with other patrons and/or off-duty staff.  His refills were promptly supplied by their on-duty hostess.  Also somewhat perturbing was the fact we could hear his entire conversation from the opposite side of the bar.  We get it, you're important, but a little humility goes a long way.  Having been in the restaurant business ourselves for well over a decade in some of the more well known establishments in Scottsdale, my wife and I perceived this to be a completely unprofessional way of representing both himself and his brand.  If he would've simply been seated at one of the several open seats at the bar or community hightops, he would've gone completely unnoticed.  And I sure hope that wasn't his white Range sans a handicap plate in the handicap space within steps of the front door.  Either way, a friendly bunch, for sure, as they all made it a point to say goodbye to us on the way out, but perhaps management should re-evaluate some of their policies to mirror those of the more tenured and respected establishments in the Valley.  A long and prosperous future would await them..."}
{"text":"Service was awesome ... brisket is damn good and fish n chips were really good.  Wife's Colorado Bulldog was perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting friends.  (Yes I just got married), and my stomach was growling something awful. So we all decided to hit this place up for our first visit dinner. What a pleasant surprise it was when we walked in. The reclaimed wood was a nice accent along with the brick walls and the lights remade from old fans. Real comfy inside. Lets get to the food shall we. We all shared a plate full of nachos which were presented on a rectangular cookie sheet. We basically devoured them in plain sight of everyone, and wasn't ashamed of it either. For our entrees I chose the beet salad and my wife got the Brussels sprouts salad. I know, I know, who orders salad at a barbecue place? Sorry, but someone has to eat a little healthy now and then. My salad was good but a little small. It could have been bigger but the dressing was nice and the veggies were fresh. The Brussels sprouts salad was a nightmare. We were shocked they were raw. You have to cook them first so you don't break your teeth on them. I had a few bites as well as my wife and tossed the rest. They really should put them in the oven or fry them up first. Won't be getting that again. All n all a nice experience for our first time. I'm not going to let the Brussels salad damper the night. Will try  again on a cheat night and splurge on something juicy.  Later"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have found in the Valley, the metal chairs hold it back for me. They are unsittable, if there is no booth option I pass that night."}
{"text":"Wish I could this place zero stars. This place came highly recommended, but the evening started on the wrong foot with it taking 10 minutes to be acknowledged.   The food was below average with the beef ribs being terrible - no meat. The brisket was underwhelming and the pulled pork was substandard. How this place can stay popular with the small portions, below average service and bland food is beyond me. My guess is it won't if these conditions continue!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here after searching options on Yelp.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews may have had our expectations too high.  Let's start with the positives:  we were greeted and seated immediately.  The service was very friendly!  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, spacious, and comfortable.   The cons: not all of the food was great.  For the price point I expect a kids grilled cheese to NOT be burnt.  For the record, the chips were ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"Came in late (after 1pm) for lunch on Friday...nice decor, good selection on the menu.  I had one of the Two Meat lunch specials--Brisket and Pulled Pork and a beer.   The brisket and pork were delicious, plenty of flavor.  The bbq sauce on the side was fine for dipping.  Recommended.   I'd like to try the bacon board, but it's too much for one..will have to come back with others to try it.."}
{"text":"Kiki and Robin rock. Best bartenders. They make amazing drinks from scratch. Personality they reach everyone. They make you feel welcome! Lauren is also awesome! She chats with everyone sitting at the bar! She had fun energy!! Bootleggers is a great place! Wings are crazy good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Bootleggers in old town before and loved the great BBQ and moon shine drinks. Just had another great experience for the first time at the Shea location.  Our waiter Josh was very knowledgeable and went above and beyond for everyone at the restaurant.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Neat atmosphere, came for happy hour after a Giants Spring training game. Food was good (nacho flat and Asian spicy wings), drinks were a little weak. Still a nice place to try out."}
{"text":"Veggie tacos were great! The prickly pear margarita was great as well. Cute little touristy spot, and the atmosphere was really fun, revival bootlegger. We had a super sweet waitress who dealt with a big loud party very patiently. I think her name was Jennifer and if it wasn't, I'm terrible with names, so sorry. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"First time here. Family of 4, 2 teenagers and 2 adults, we had brunch at 11:30. Walked in, had great seating choices, sat in a high booth near the bar. Berkeley took care of us. Service was excellent, he offered tasting of all the infused moonshine which was a great intro. experience to know what the restaurant offers. We had the brunch menu offerings: Bloody Mary's, Bacon Bomb ( 2 eggs, smoked bacon wrapped in a bread and the outer layer wrapped in bacon and potato hash), Bootleggers Burger (house sauce, muenster, whiskey onions, slab of bacon on a pretzel bun) and PBLT (10 hr. Smoked pork belly, beefsteak tomato, red onion, iceberg, spiced aioli, grilled sourdough). Food, service, atmosphere, and even music were great. My one \"con\" comment would be the wait time for food was long, considering there was only in all 3 tables filled. Though we will definitely be back to try for dinner, just the thought of smoked prime rib, OMG sound like heaven."}
{"text":"No wifi!!??? Why? Nice atmosphere but for this area it's too pricey (food and drink). Hope they are willing to invest a small amount of money on wifi and get into the 20th century."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, the atmosphere was awesome and our server, Leon, was great!"}
{"text":"Came here on vacation and loved this place. Very clean and friendly service. I tried the turkey and brisket, both really good! I highly reccomend this place."}
{"text":"We went to Bootleggers after being teased by the picture of the bloody mary with the mini slider on top. We drove up on a Saturday and were disappointed to learn they only serve those on Sunday's.   We opted for the regular bloody mary and the mixture was so spicy I could barely finish it. That was disappointing because it will probably sway me away from ordering it on a Sunday.   I saw bacon board on the menu and could not talk myself out of ordering it. It was delicious! It was a carefully curated collection of the finest all-natural swine slabs served with w/griddled toast, sweet onion jam, house yellow mustard and house brined pickles. The sweet cherry and the jalapeno were my favorite. I balanced that out with the kale salad and it was equally good.   I will definitely return as it is a local spot with friendly staff, I just may not get the bloody mary."}
{"text":"Prime rib was amazing. Apple pie moonshine was amazing. Waitress Dana was amazing. I don't know what else to say...I had a great time here."}
{"text":"Good, but a bit pricey. Rock shrimp appetizer with cheddar grits was $14, and it was tiny. Short ribs were $22 with no side. It was very tender and full of flavor, but for that price, it should include fries.  We added cottage fries for $6.  The smoked turkey leg was $18 and came with coleslaw and tortilla.  Turkey was like something you get at the fair, but the coleslaw had no flavor.  The blueberry peach cobbler was amazing, but should be for $9.  I think they baked it when we ordered it, because it took a while to come out.  The food was pretty good, but they should add sides for the price.  The BBQ Program menu comes with sides, but the entrees come with nothing."}
{"text":"Went here tonight based on reviews from yelp.  We ordered food to go.  They cook everything except the salads in some spice rub so beware if you do not like spicy food, which we do not.  The grill cheese sandwich with bacon is very spicy due to the rub on the bacon, it is also very expensive @ $13.00 and not at all worth it - 3 different kinds of cheese, 1 piece of bacon on sourdough bread.  Nothing special and way over price along with the mac & cheese a itsy bitsy tiny bowl for $5.00.... The kale salad and the cobb salad nothing special once again just ok.  The cole slaw which came with the brisket, again nothing special just ok....The cobbler is very very sweet, overly sweet and the chocolate cake while okay it is a bit expensive @ $6.00 for what you get or rather do not get.  I had the beef brisket, the rub again was spicy so what I could eat was very good, it was tender and melted in my mouth.  I would not recommend taking food out, but rather eating it to experience the big screen tv, the bar and the high booths... My family was not impressed with the place, but I like dives so I will try again if just for the brisket."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time on a \"paint night\" that's hosted here what seems like every month.  Service was good, but the wings that I ordered... Oh the wings. It was phenomenal. I was chowing down Neanderthal style shamelessly. It was very good! I was trying to be healthy so I got them grilled versus fried. I was hesitant and didn't expect them to be as good as they were. Flavorful and smoky. I also found the side condiments to be a nice touch as well, as instead of the plain ole celery and carrot sticks which usually accompany wings were replaced by pickled celery and carrots. Very nice touch!  Don't hesitate. Try the grilled wings... I don't think you will be disappointed. I'll be back next time to try the key menu items and update the review. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Bacon. I enjoyed my first time here. Menu was not as cleaver as I expected, but I did appreciate the bacon board selection. Second experience was boring. It's great for one visit."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Treated two of my friends out to dinner here. We were able to get a table no problem. Service was good. Food was delicious. Definitely pricey but well worth it. Will return here again in the future! A+"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh....some good and some not so good. Bacon board is ok but overpriced for what it is. 6 slices of bacon and pork belly(pork belly not the best). The bacon is awesome though!! Wife had the Smokehouse burger and its amazing!!!! I had the bbq sampler....it was ehhh....hot links were soooooo good!!!! Brisket and turkey were EXTREMELY dry and almost tasted old. The ribs are FANTASTIC and the pulled pork was also amazing and probably the best Cole slaw I have ever had. We had the peach cobbler and it was also AMAZING!!!! Probably won't come back. Not enjoyable enough for the money/drive. The server also kind of ignored us most of the night. It was really slow and I  expected higher quality from somewhere like Bootleggers."}
{"text":"We ordered take out. Ordered the Cobb salad, notorious chicken sandwich, bootlegger burger, kids bbq pork sliders, smoked sweet corn and cobbler. It was alright. Not worth the money to me"}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. If I could afford to eat here everyday, I would. From the friendly greeting by the hostess, to the atmosphere, to the service, to the food...everything made us feel so comfortable! The Nacho Flat had deliciously, tender brisket hash with an amazing cheese sauce and chunky avocado relish. The house chips with goat gouda cheese dip was rendered spectacular due to the smokey bento bacon included. The dip was served warm but was still delicious as it cooled. The cold smoked chicken wings were meaty and smokey and the traditional sauce was not too spicy to enjoy. The pickled vegetables served on the side were extremely tart but had a unique taste and I couldn't stop eating them. The pulled pork was served lightly sauced, in chunks with a tasty cole slaw on the side. I don't think I've ever had pulled pork this tender and delicious. I 'm convinced if I ever lose my teeth, I could still enjoy it. The Mac & Cheese with bechamel sauce is also some of the best I've ever had. They have a pretty decent beer selection and when I ordered a Dark & Stormy the bartender made a special visit to my table to explain how he makes his version so I wouldn't be disappointed or surprised. Our remarkable waitress Tammy was just the best. Even though her section was busy, she patiently answered all our questions, made sure to check on us frequently and was extremely pleasant, helpful and friendly as was the young lady who filled our water and bussed our table. This is definitely a 5 star restaurant to me and I'm not the only one who thinks so. Check out this review from the Phoenix New Times for more raves: http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2013-08-08/restaurants/bootleggers-bbq-renaissance-north-phoenix/"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego and was absolutely satisfied with every aspect of our experience. Scrumptious bbq sampler, cauliflower steak and mac and cheese. Excellent service by John!! The Flapper spirit and Apple Pie moonshine took it to another level of satisfaction. We all agreed it would be worth a drive and a night in a hotel! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"APPLE PIE MOONSHINE- I'm not even exaggerating when I say this is the best drink I've ever had in my life!  It tastes like apple pie without any of the cruel alcoholic regret you feel from any normal cocktail. I'm not a drink connoisseur but I love drinks that taste fruity & awesome without a strong alcoholic taste and this is it. Apparently they use everclear as a base which is why it reminds me of jungle juice in college. A strong ass drink with amazing fruity flavor without the alcoholic taste?!? Ugh sooo amazing. And plus it's only $5 for the apple pie moonshine? Ugh I'm coming back tomorrow night. My bf and I are around for a staycation and we're both set on coming back all weekend because of this drink. We got a flight to try the apple pie, blackberry and one other but that last one was so damn strong $I can't remember the name.  Blackberry was just as tasty as apple pie but I love the taste of apple pie better.   Amazing service. I think his name was Rob(?) but he was so helpful and gave us some awesome recommendations. I'm glad he helped us avoid the super strong selections since my boyfriend and I had already been drinking before we walked in.   The only complaint we'd have is that they didn't have the apple pie moonshine to buy to take home :( my sister in California would love this and I'm sad I couldn't take this home to let her try it."}
{"text":"If your arteries aren't clogged yet, they soon will be after eating here.  I found this place to be \"so-so\", I was really hoping for a smokey BBQ joint, but found the flavor of their meat to be quite flat.  Started out with the guacamole and pomegranate seeds dip. The chips aren't. They are chicarones, i.e. deep fried pig skin.  Shared the Bacon Board and BBQ sampler. The bacon board was 2 pieces each of 5 different types of pork fat. Some people raved about it. I didn't care for it. The sampler platter was an improvement but still lacked the low and slow flavoring of what good BBQ is all about. The pulled pork was dry. The ribs were the saving grace.   This place, like most others in Old Town Scottsdale can get quite busy on the weekends, so plan to wait awhile to be seated."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! Great vibe, nice decor and very good food! I had the chicken sandwich with white Cheddar and arugula. The server made a mistake and gave me fried instead of grilled chicken. I told her and she took it back no problem. She even gave me my meal for free (which I am not the kind of person looking for a free meal, I actually felt kind of bad) but she had no problem fixing it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"OMG!  I have been here a few times now.  Usually, I just go and have the pork belly tacos which  are only $5 during happy hour.  Amazing.  However, I went there for lunch and they didn't have those tacos so I opted for the brisket and could not believe it.  It was probably the most flavorful piece of meat I have ever eaten in my life and that is huge as I love meat.  It also comes with HOMEMADE flour tortillas.  I'm such a tortilla girl, but I barely ate them as the brisket was soooo amazingly good.   It was so good, I ate two orders!!!!    It's not cheap, but it is well worth it.  Can't wait to go back.      BTW, they also sell moonshine!!!!  Too cool!"}
{"text":"OMG! First time trying Bootleggers and I wasn't sure what to expect. First of all, Dana was amazing! So friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere was very welcoming, staff was very friendly.  We started with the deviled eggs...very tasty. We split a cobb salad which was good as well. For entree's husband had the prime rib which was sooo tender and full of flavor the mashed rex potato with goat cheese was incredible. I had the beef brisket and tried the spicy bbq sauce...AMAZING! The drinks were excellent. I had The flapper. Soo good. We also sampled thed housemade apple pie moonshine which was so good. Not toooo strong. The have a housemade White Lightning that I was just tooo full to try. I highly recommend Bootleggers. We will be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Very average tourist destination restaurant in Old Scottsdale. Brisket was a fat laden mess, the bacon sampler was \"ehh\". Didn't much care for the cuisine in general. Maybe it's because I've had BBQ all over the country and have relatively high standards??  The turkey was the surprise winner of the evening. I'm sure there are places with better food in the neighborhood. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times. It has been great experience constantly. We love sharing appetizer sampler so as dinner for two. Good selection of tap beer."}
{"text":"Treated badly because they undercooked (raw-rare) my filet. Cook recooked the same meat and reserved it to me. After I was told they would bring me a new one cooked correctly.    Twice cooked filet? Really? No thanks!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer or have anything from their great menu. The bar and sitting area is as hip and rustic as it gets. Very friendly staff and all around a good place to be a usual hang-out place."}
{"text":"D-LICIOUS!  Bootleggers is in the location that was previously occupied by Praying Monk, a favorite of mine and my boyfriend's.  While we were disappointed to see Monk go, I have to say that I am overjoyed that their departure made way for Bootleggers' arrival.    My boyfriend, and a friend and I went for lunch a couple of days ago.  First of all, I like what they've done with the interior, and the service was very good.  The only change that I was not happy with was the fact that they took the big couch off of the back patio.  Oh well, too cold to sit outside right now anyway.    The following food items were ordered in my party:  chips and dip app, turkey melt, pulled pork plate, chopped brisket sandwich, green beans, cottage fries, and mac n cheese.  The only thing that wasn't amazing was the order of green beans.  They were ok, but nothing you couldn't get from the grocery store.  Their homemade chips are thin and crispy.  The dip is very good but very rich.  If you don't like goat cheese, you will not like the dip.  I had the chopped brisket sandwich, which comes with cole slaw on top.  I typically don't like slaw, so I ordered it on the side, but I loved it!  I put it on my sandwich and ate it alone, it was so tasty.  I also had a \"side\" of mac n cheese.  It was served in a skillet and was super hot with a layer of cheese baked on top--fantastic.  I could have just eaten that and have been full.  My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork.  It was pretty good, but that's just not my thing.  Finally, my friend ordered the turkey melt and cottage fries.  The fries were good, but the turkey melt was even better.  I usually think turkey sandwiches are a little uninspiring, but this one was definitely different.  The turkey was extremely flavorful, and combined with the melted cheese and arugula, it was a winner!    I will definitely be going back to Bootleggers sooner rather than later.  It was certainly one of the best meals I've had in Old Town in a while, and there are so many other things on the menu that I want to try!"}
{"text":"When you get it, the food is good. I've been here many times to eat and sent them a lot of business, but the real question is Do they want the business? About a month ago, my husband called in an order of wings. When he got there, the bartender told him the wings would be right out. Fifteen minutes later, the bartender informed him they were out of wings. He left empty handed.  So, when we decided to use them for a Christmas lunch we were hosting for my husband's department at work, we wanted to make sure that they could be trusted and went in a week before to place the order and get the specs down. The owner (I believe) was nice, but the bartender blew us off and told us to just call in the order that day. I needed the order at 10:30 and the bartender said they weren't open then. I asked if they weren't open for brunch anymore as we had been in a couple of weeks ago and it was great; the bartender had no clue as the (owner) chimed in and said they did open at 10am on the weekends. (Words of advice: if someone wants to spend a couple hundred bucks thirty minutes before you open by picking up an order of food that is already cooked while employees are getting the dining room ready for service, do it). I wanted to make sure the meat came in half hotel pans when you ordered it by the pound, and the (owner) said that it is how they serve the meat by the pound. I stressed how important this order was timely and correct, and the (owner) said I needed to call the day before and speak to Ashley (chef) or the GM and they could be trusted to get it done. My husband and I laughed several times that there were only two employees that could be trusted to give the order to. I placed the order with Ashley the day before and she was nice and assured me the order would be ready.  My husband walked in at 10:35 to pick up the order and it was not ready. They told him the order was written on the board, but no time was listed so they didn't know (maybe call the chef and ask???). They also asked if they were individual orders or pounds of meat. They told him it would be ready in 15 minutes. Meanwhile, 2 patrons walk in and the manager tells them they are not open and turns them away (so ARE you open for brunch? It may actually work if your employees and patrons were correctly informed) If you want business, invite them in, offer a cocktail, and tell them they can order off the menu in 15 minutes. But my husband said the manager scowled when they did walk in 15 minutes later and decided to put on his black shirt and finally greet them. Why was my husband still there? Oh, yes, the order took over 30 minutes for them to make.  When the food did arrive at our home, the order was in individual Togo containers and sans potato salad. I called to say it was missing and was asked if I wanted to come back to pick it up. When I walked in, the bartender told me he needed to go get the order ready. REALLY? So, he did not charge me when I offered to pay, but not one apology was given. I arrived back at home an hour after our party had started and some guests had to leave 30 minutes later. The problem is, I'm sad because I really did like this place, but if they don't want or appreciate my business, I'll take it elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very nice service.  The food was lacking big time! I came here because of the bbq ribs pulled work all that yummy stuff and it was not what i expected. Everything was very dry and chewy. Maybe I came  on the wrong night because it was very slow in there.  I don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and disappointed both times. Staff have been nice, but the food was bland and disappointing. After the first visit we thought we would give it another shot, we got the special meat platter. Ugh. Nothing was good. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot here, but nothing to write home about. The modern BBQ thing is a little overplayed. We were ravenously hungry, having just ran the Rock and roll marathon, so a brick wall would have been tempting to gnaw on. We got the nachos appetizer off the waitress's suggestion and it was a bit too greasy for my tastes. Huge hunks of onion were a large part of the Nacho topping. I would not normally order nachos but they had so few appetizer options.  We then split a BBQ plate with pulled pork and brisket w/ cole slaw. Again I found some really fatty, greasy peices but it was moist and flavorful. Very smoky too. You had to ask specifically to get BBQ sauce, which was weird for me. I'm used to having sauce in abundance at the table. I'm kind of obsessed with over saucing my BBQ though so that's probably not a fair criticism.  Nice beer selection (even though they were out of several options on the menu) and some good deals for Sunday brunch/ lunch time. Pretty good kids meal options too that branch out just a bit on choices. My 8 yr old ate the pork sliders and loved it. I would probably find another option next time in looking for BBQ in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  I dream of really great fall of the bone, juicy baby back ribs,  I was hoping Bootleggers was my new spot.  The baby backs were tough and greasy and the sauce was bland and lack luster.   My buddy got the brisket, some parts were wow and others were blobs of artery clogging full on no holds barred fat!  Why couldn't this place be my new solution to having to smoke ribs myself!@#*"}
{"text":"This is the second best barbecue in Arizona behind Little Miss barbecue. The reason I gave them five stars is because they are a sit down restaurant where as Little Miss barbecue is a casual concept. The beef brisket is utterly amazing! But the true superstar is the bacon board appetizer. You would be a fool if you did not order it. Visualize eight different types of bacon coming out on wood board cooked perfectly!  I am not a big fan of the ribs and would not recommend you ordering them. Everything else, is great barbecue."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner. Walked in to a busy place with an awesome guitarist playing!  He was incredible! From BB King to Robert Plant!!  Our server John said every Friday they have live music! Great to know.  Now to the booze/food.  Started with drinks! Served in mason jars! Excellent!!  Ordered the Bacon board! What can I say..... bacon 5 ways with Noble bread and pickles and roasted red peppers and spicy grown mustard.  Devine!  Then I ordered the mussels! Served with tomatoes, garlic and spicy sausage. Fresh herbs... oh and more noble bread!  Husband ordered the brisket sandwich with cottage fries. So juicy and served on a roll that absorbed all the great juice.  Dessert? Nope. But I ordered a flight of Moonshine! They make their own there and you must try it!!  I had the apple pie, Blackberry and Cat Daddy.  You choose 3 for $10!! Delightful!  This location us the only one I've been to.  I love how unassuming it is. In a strip mall.  Walk in.... so cool!  You must try it!!"}
{"text":"I planned a group dinner here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and our experience was ridiculously bad from start to finish. It was one of those situations where everything that could go wrong did go wrong.   There were issues making the reservation and I had to call multiple times to be sure everything was confirmed. I knew they had another group that night but was assured it wouldn't affect the service. When we arrived, the hostess said they were about to give our table away because they had it in their system incorrectly.   We had some of the most laughably bad service I have ever experienced. I would hope that any restaurant would put one of their more competent servers on a table of almost 20 people. It wasn't a busy night - the restaurant was half empty.  It took forever for food/drinks to come out. When orders eventually came out, the server would wander aimlessly around the table asking \"did someone order the ___.\" If an order was dropped off at the table, it was not in front of the person who ordered it. It was like musical chairs trying to pass drinks/meals to the right person. Also - they were out of clean water glasses.   Our server kept assuming items she was carrying out were extra, giving it to someone else at the table saying \"Must be extra, I guess you can have it for free.\" This happened with my drink, which ended up being passed down to me from the other end of the table after she 'gave it away' to someone else. My meal was also given to the wrong person. This happened to the majority of us.   Although we all ordered at the same time, meals came out sporadically... some 30+ minutes after the majority of the table had their food. One person in our group didn't get his meal until 40 minutes after everyone else. Our server needed constant reminding that people that were still missing meals, even 15-20 minutes after the first meals started coming out.   After 20 minutes of people having their food sit out and get cold, we started eating - sharing food with the people whose meals hadn't shown up. Items that weren't being delivered weren't complicated meals - they were basic salads and sandwiches.   Even though the service was a total nightmare, the restaurant staff was completely unapologetic. We expected an explanation for why the service was so bad, but never got one. They also didn't offer to discount any of the food/drinks.   I wanted to complain at the time, but didn't want to make a scene (and my boyfriend asked me not to). I was mortified to have planned the event and have the dinner be such a mess.   Added bonus? The bathrooms were disgusting - there was blood on the toilet in one stall and tons of TP with blood on it overflowing out of the trash can. No TP in the stalls. Unreal."}
{"text":"John was a great server! Had the lunch sampler of brisket and pulled pork...very filling with yummy bbq sauce. Food was delivered quickly. 8 thumbs up from Iowa!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped here Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Heard good things about Bootleggers. We just missed the happy hour but our server let us order wings at the happy hour price. Nice.  The menu items weren't our cup of tea so we ordered the pulled pork w cole slaw and tortillas. The pulled pork and cole slaw were very good but to be honest, $13 seemed a little much for the meal. I'd have to give 4 stars for food and 2 stars for value so I settled on 3. Also, wings are normally $9 for 5 wings...thank goodness we got the happy hour price of $5."}
{"text":"I went for lunch, which may have been a mistake because the menu seems limited, despite the menu listed here, but either way, we started with brisket nachos which looked promising and were edible, but each piece of brisket on the platter was probably 95% fat and 5% meat, seems like they could use some quality control.   For my entree I ordered the express lunch (your choice of 2 meats). I chose turkey and brisket, it came with coleslaw and tortillas. I don't know why I had tortillas with this, unless it's because we are in Arizona?! Again, I was disappointed by the brisket. It was not extremely tasty and very very very fatty, the turkey was pretty good but dry.   My friend got the pulled pork sandwich, but he ended up not eating much of it because it was smothered in too much dressing and bbq sauce.   I wouldn't really recommend based on this experience, but maybe I'll try it again for dinner one night."}
{"text":"I do not recommended this eatery unless you only want drinks. They have a great happy hour that is every night of the week but I wouldn't order food. We had the pork tacos that did not sit well with me and the prime rib dip sandwich that was very fatty."}
{"text":"Located in a semi-empty shopping center, but it doesn't disappoint once you get inside. The staff was great, very personable and ready to help with recommendations. Between the four of us we had a burger, pulled pork and sliced brisket. All were well prepared and tasty! Our only criticism was that the slaw was pretty bland, not doing its job of offsetting the tanginess of the barbecue.  I recommend this as a place worth seeking out and trying!"}
{"text":"We sat out on back back as we had a large group. The menu and the smell was amazing. We never ended up ordering main dishes for some reason but the manager brought us some additional appetizers to try. It was very filling. We tried the nachos (best tasting nacho ever ) see picture , wings (very good but nothing crazy) , bacon platter (this was really cool and yummy lots of bacon fat, had many different types of bacon, PB&J sliders. Essentially looked like a big piece of bacon fat on a slider roll with lettuce and tomato (it was good but not great)  I know had I tried the smoked brisket this review  would have been 6 stars but i can only review the app's for now. Customer service was stellar. Should be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I had the Red Brick chicken and it was delicious. Excellent selection of beers too. April brought my beer and was Fantastic. Wonderful personality. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"During our recent trip here, we must have had an \"off-night\" with the restaurant. The service was marginal, and the food came out lukewarm, to put it at best. My advice to other fellow Yelpers is to go to the Bootleggers in Scottsdale. It's much newer, has a nicer dining room, and a MUCH more welcoming wait staff. Avoid the restaurant on Shea if you can possibly help it."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is back! The homemade Bloody Mary mix they use has got to be the freshest bloody I have ever had. Nothing artificial or 'canned' about this one. Try the chicken waffle bites or the green chile pork burrito. I took my 4 year old there on Sunday and it has a warm family atmosphere, but still a wonderful Sunday football scene. Great place to watch the game!  Our family will be back next Sunday!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, our waitress was very efficient. Food was great but if your looking for that country midwest BBQ flavor this is a little bit different, hence the \"modern american smokehouse\". Nice little hidden atmosphere and okay for kids. I was a little bit hesitant when we pulled up, it looked like a bar, but the inside was a complete different feel. Also, nice selection of classic oldies music."}
{"text":"Ok so- I used the Yelp app to help me find a place close to where I was staying in AZ- and this one came up in my search results. They had a good overall rating and I was looking for a place that is not also in NYC. Never heard of a \"Bootleggers\" before so this seemed like a good place.   Anyway I am so glad I came here!! Came in the early afternoon about 1pm and there weren't many people inside. The atmosphere was pretty dim which is nice, and there seemed to be plenty of tables and seating room. Decent sized bar up front and they seemed to have had a few good beers on tap and a large selection of liquor. The place was pretty big overall. Unfortunately, they must have been short staffed this day because there was only one girl working the bar and serving food. But as I said, not that many people were inside so she kept it under control. She was also a sweetheart by the way. It's always nice to have service with a smile and a very pleasant attitude.   So the service was great! Now on to the food. The food was fantastic! Wow. I wish we had this place in NYC! Now it is \"bar food\" but it was just so damn good! I ended up ordering the bootlegger burger. Cooked exactly how I asked, covered in cooked onions, cheese and this dijonnaise sauce on a pretzel bun. So delicious! Also had a taste of the brisket tacos which was small, but delicious as well! I'd recommend it as an appetizer though. The burger not so much haha That was quite filling! I was also curious about the Mac and cheese and I got a side order of that and even that was awesome! The place is a bit pricey but very well worth it!  You definitely gotta stop in here and grab something to eat- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Have come here 2 times and haven't been disappointed. I've had the nachos once and the brisket was perfect and moist. The sauce on the nachos was great as well. 2nd time i had the prime rib which is one of the best I've tried. This place never disappoints"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Love the bacon board and brisket. You can't go wrong here and Larry \"PM Bar\" is the best bartender ever! See you soon Larry."}
{"text":"This was our second time at this establishment. The first time we were here I tried their pulled pork sandwich, it was good but not excellent.   This time however I tried their salmon entree and wow, it was absolutely incredible! The presentation was amazing and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The fregola sarda and apple cider gastrique was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this entree.  And for dessert I had their peach cobbler which was very good. I'm glad this restaurant is within walking distance to our house. which made for a lovely evening with my wife."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Great service. Terrific atmosphere.  Try and sit outside.  Cozy fireplace."}
{"text":"I must say, wow!   These guys have stepped up their game and the new menu is outstanding.  If you find yourself in AZ, I strongly recommend you drive directly to either of their two locations.   Start with a bacon board and go directly to the Boot Burger.   I believe it's one of the best burgers in America.  I know, that's a big statement, but they are delivering on the goods.  Sorry no pic on this post.  My hands and mouth were too busy...next time I check in I will post a few pics."}
{"text":"Hard to rate this one. The bacon board was excellent except but the entrees weren't so good. Why use a smoker if you are going to cover the meat in bbq sauce that tastes like ketchup?  Drinks were good and they had a good selection of craft brews from Four Peaks, SanTan, Papago and others. Our server was excellent and got one of our entrees comped when it was messed up. Could have been 3 stars because of the poor bbq sauce but the service made it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Celebrated our son's graduation from college this evening.  His favorite place is Bootleggers, so we decided to give it a try.    We had fantastic service. The food was delicious - especially if you like smoked food.  Convenient downtown Scottsdale location.  We ate till we were stuffed and closed the place down.  The executive chef was terrific as was the wait staff.  Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we'd visit Scottsdale again just to return to Bootleggers. We loved the prime rib- the flavor was delicious but warning it is very rare! The mac&cheese was noteworthy as well. The best item was the Apple pie moonshine- get it! Dana was a wonderful server and made our dinner extra fun. Thanks Dana!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, drinks are creative.  Love the pickler tickler!  The drinks are a little pricey (main reason I'm not going 5 out of 5).  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Super cute atmosphere. Fries are an extra $3 but absolutely worth it! My husband and I both had the pulled pork sandwich which was yummy. My husband said the coleslaw was delish too. We shall be back with friends and family."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place by accident and how lucky was that! The service was outstanding from the second we walked in the door. The bar was comfortable without a doubt. The drinks were amazing!! We were rocking there Old Fashion Moonshine cocktail which was fabulous, then the food came out to complete the package. Delicious and filling! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, perfect for catching the game on tv or meeting with a small group.  I suggest going with the sampler if you cannot decide between the brisket (5 stars) and hot links.  Share it or take some home its a decision you wont regret."}
{"text":"Excellent service to start. Yummy cocktails. Try the blueberry bourbon drink!  Sweet potato fries with really interesting maple dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Bacon lovers unite! Even their chocolate cake has bacon!  And the \"Bacon Board\" appetizer is heaven!   I wanted to try everything on the menu: drinks, appetizers, sandwiches, entrees, sides, desserts . . . but oh heck, I couldn't . . . so here's what I tried the first time around (it will not be my last time here . . . guarantee!)  House Made Apple Pie Moonshine - tastes like apple pie, definitely Bathtub Gin Cocktail - Oh, my! Cucumbers, lemon and gin! Bacon Board - 5 kinds of bacon with sweet onion jam, red pepper jam & mustard PBLT - 10 hr smoked pork belly, lettuce tomatoe and aioli Grilled Cauliflower Steak - melted cheedar and whiskey onions Smashed Potatoes - Yukon gold, port salut and chives  A meal I won't soon forget.  Our server - Kaylyn - was great at making recommendations and had detailed knowledge of the drinks and menu. She said that she had tried everything on the menu - could this be true? I, for one, did not see a single thing on the menu I wouldn't try.  Next time. FULL now. Can we go back for lunch tomorrow?"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience.   Although not the best location, this place was awesome.   We sat down and checked out the menu there were lots of great choices.   However, because this was our first time here we got the sampler platter for 4, cottage fries and a side of mac and cheese, which were recommended by our server Dan P.  I ordered the apple pie moonshine for everyone as a dinner opener and it was exquisite!   All the sweet apple and cinnamon flavor splashing over my tongue was like drinking a slice of apple pie, I wanted some vanilla ice cream to pair with it.  Then the food came out and what a selection  pulled pork, hot links, ribs, turkey and brisket with cole slaw and flour tortillas on the side.  There were also 3 types of  BBQ sauce regular, Dr. Pepper, and jalapeño.   Everything was delicious but the pulled pork and brisket were to die for.  I rolled the pulled pork in a tortilla with some cole slaw and hot BBQ sauce and I just melted with every bite.  The brisket so tender and juicy was just amazing just the way it was served.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any better BAM the Mac and Cheese just swept my taste buds away.  All the delicious creamy, cheesy goodness was the knock out punch especially when eaten with the grilled hot link that came with the sampler.  The waitress, Dan P., was exceptional!  Her warm greeting, friendly smile and perky attitude made this experience a great success.  She helped with selections and made recommendations that were on point.  When I go back to try the prime rib, which Dana suggested and made sound so good that even though I was full, I will ask for her.    This is a must try place if you've never been.  I want to thank the chefs, bar tenders and wait staff for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"We started w/ the guacamole and the bacon board. The guacamole had pomegranate and roasted pumpkin seeds. It was really delicious and we enjoyed it. The bacon board is very expensive but was a fun change. I wish they would of crisped up the smoked pork belly on the flat top, that would give the fat a better texture. The other bacons were great. In my perfect world they would add a few nuts, dried fruit and a few cheeses, like a bacon charcuterie board. That would make it a more reasonable cost per product. We also had the cottage fries, nice and crispy, good flavor. The pulled pork and brisket came next. The brisket was moist, first hurdle for any smoked meat. It was good but I prefer a much more of a heavily spiced bark. The pulled pork was also good but slightly dry, we had to add sauce. The sauce that came w/ it was great, really liked it. The coleslaw was right up my alley. Cilantro was throughout it, right amount of wetness, good sweetness but not overkill. The waitstaff were on point. The atmosphere was exactly what I hoped for, the lighting fixtures are a pleasant addition. I would return."}
{"text":"2nd time here & it's still yummy.  I had an interesting salad w/ a side of pretty straightforward pulled pork.  Overall good food in a laid back environment. Glad to see detail on menu about pecan wood smoked meats since we have a nut allergy at the table."}
{"text":"Made a reservation online for 6:30 and when we arrived the place was very busy but were seated right away.  Our waitress Lisa was very helpful and very nice. They are very attentive to their customers and throughout the meal multiple employees came to check on us. We had the nacho flat which was very good, but very large and could be split as a meal. I ordere the prime Rb iand they were very accommodating when I asked to change my side order. The portion of this meal was extremely large and excellent!! My husband ordered the brisket and it also was a great portion and very good. This was well worth a visit and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Always looking for something new and different. This smokehouse is not by far your everyday smokehouse. We started with a bacon board, had six different kinds of bacon. Then we ordered the sampler for dinner. Came with hot link, brisket pork, and turkey. Great smoke flavor across the board. Had a peaceful and quite dinner."}
{"text":"I thought bootleggers was really good and the service was great as well! She was friendly, fast and personable and that might be the best part of an experience. The black tea is great but the moonshine is obviously better :). We split the plate for two and mac and cheese! This was PLENTY of food which I was worried about thinking about the amount of food he eats. I will be recommending this place to people and taking people from out of state here!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that i very much enjoyed the experience that I had here. The inside of the restaurant is very nice and the service staff was absolutely great. Very attentive without being overbearing and more than happy to answer any question we had.   That all being said, any good BBQ restaurant or smokehouse should be judged heavily on their food and BBQ sauce. The food we had was actually very good. Delicious burgers and wings. Everything cooked how it was requested.   But wow, what a bitter disappointment the BBQ sauce was and all sauces for that matter. In the course of our meal, we tried 4 different wing and BBQ sauces and neither of us liked any of them. A molasses/maple aioli came with my girlfriends burger and it was the sweetest thing I think I have ever eaten. Thankfully it came on the side so it didn't ruin her burger. Most of their sauces followed that same way where they were just incredibly sweet which is super unfortunate. We ordered our wing appetizer with all the sauces so I got to try them before ordering any BBQ items because I would have had some serious issues.   If this were just a happy hour location that I was looking at I would probably come back because it was a good atmosphere but if I can't trust you to make a good house BBQ sauce, I'm not going to trust your BBQ food."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I was craving a burger...googled \"best burger in Phoenix\" and Bootleggers came up. It's less than a mile from our house. How did I not know about this place?!?  The decor is awesome...rustic and comfortable. They have tables, booths, hard seats, soft seats, tall stools, etc. Something for everyone.   We've only been for lunch or early afternoon and there is always plenty of places to sit.   Food is awesome! Burger is the best I've had. My husband got a bloody mary with a \"slider\"...it's a burger...seriously. So good...those are only available on Sundays. We've been back and gotten the PBLT sandwich, the brisket, ahi tuna sandwich...all awesome! They make their own chips on site.   And they usually let us sample their moonshine. I am not a fan of moonshine but I did try the peach cobbler moonshine this last time and it was soooooo good!   I give Bootleggers 5 stars for their ambiance and food. The service is slow. It takes a while to get your food. Thankfully we've never been in a hurry...so we don't feel pushed out of the restaurant, either.   I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Monday night, first time checking it out, kind of excited because it's close to home and, well... it's BBQ. It's located in a nondescript strip mall but the interior is close to perfect for reflecting the Tennessee/ Kentucky BBQ vibe- rustic wood, industrial light fixture and bulbs. The lighting was a little dim, making it hard to read the menus but nice for an overall experience. They have a huge sliding door that really opens up the space, leading right in to the bar area.   The food? We split an order of the St. Louis ribs, which came with slaw and your choice of a dinner roll or tortillas. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese. The ribs were very tender, not very smoky. I would have liked a bit more smoke flavor. I also prefer less fatty ribs. I know it said St. Louis but these seemed like a fattier babyback. And the sauce? Kind of one-dimensional. Sweet, like ketchup, brown sugar, molasses and possibly a touch of whisky. The mac and cheese, for all of its boasting of four cheeses, was flat. I'm guessing they relied on the cheese to carry the flavor, but it needed more. And the coleslaw had pretty much no dressing but did have a big onion taste. Unfortunately. I really dislike onion. And for heaven's sake, just put some salt and pepper on the table.   So for that meal and a diet soda, we paid $45 pre-tip. The service was fine, the people were friendly, the environment is great. The food just doesn't measure up."}
{"text":"Service is very good, the food amazing. We did lunch and pull pork was out of this world. Coming back at night for the ribs. Moonshine is a must have."}
{"text":"Stopped to get a kale salad to go, sat at bar to order.  Bartender did not offer me a drink let alone a glass of water.  I ordered chicken with my salad for an extra 4 bucks.  Salad done, I paid and still tipped the un attentive bartender knowing I would be writing a review on him.  Opened up salad when I got home and the 4 dollar chicken breast was a joke.  It was half of a full breast.  So for $12.00 (15 with tip) this salad was a joke.  How does this place stay in business?"}
{"text":"Went for a quick drink with a friend after work... Cool place definitely one of the trendier places to meet up. Menu was definitely different as it's paired together that you would not normally put together but the salad I ordered was super good. Healthy option and not too pricey. The drink I had was the Moscow mule or something like that served in a copper cup.. was good for sure. !!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is my jam. Think Farm chic; low lit mason jar chandeliers, rustic wood back splash pieces, neat silver bucket bar stools, cozy and warm energy.   My most favorite thing about this place? Their Apple Pie moon shine. BEST moonshine I have ever had. Okay, that might not sound that compelling considering most moonshine tastes like heartburn and tears, but their Apple Pie moonshine is some sort of magic concoction. If I had to drink only one alcoholic beverage for the rest of my life, hands down this would be my #1 choice. Every time I have it, it is the highlight of my week. Shamelessly, I have tried multiple times to get the recipe out of the bartender since it is a \"house secret\". He has dropped hints of a few ingredients they use but didn't divulge enough for me to master theirs. Note to the owners: you hired on a loyal bartender. To be blatantly honest, I have literally tried bribing him with a decent amount of money to give me the exact recipe and he declined because he was trained to keep it a house secret. If genies existed and I had 3 wishes, one of them would be to know this exact recipe.    Menu Items to get: -Bacon board. Whoever thought of this and put it together, you're a genius. It never disappoints. -Mac and cheese. Such a good creamy and consistent cheese base that packs amazing flavor. And they obviously know that their cheese sauce is amazeballs because their noodle of choice is rotini. I know \"Mac and cheese\" is traditionally with macaroni noodles, but any pasta connoisseur  acknowledges that the best noodle to scoop in every delicious bite of cheese sauce with is the rotini noodle.  The only recommendation I have for them is their burger. It has the taste components to be an excellent burger but execution falls short. A burger should be solid in every bite and this one falls apart after the first bite, so you are left with a crumbled mess of trying to put together broken pieces to get combined ingredients into a bite."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place on yelp along with reviewing the menu online. I will tell you the first time I picked up Togo from this place in a Sunday and I was completely blown away!!! And would have rated five stars! I ordered the beef brisket with macaroni and cheese, substituted cole slaw for green beans w/an up charge (which is fine and understandable). The brisket was perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly! I enjoyed the macaroni cheese it was very cheesy and it had a nice crust of extra cheese and seasoning on top of it. I was also asked if I wanted tortilla or a bun and favored a bun which was also butter and toasted amazing! The overall ordering was very similar to how it look like online.The flavors were amazing and I was completely sold on the place.   I went back two weeks later on a Saturday and had a completely different experience. When I ordered they didn't seem to understand the menu the same as the Sunday person did which was fine but I still order a very similar meal the only change was corn vs green beans. I was not asked on my bread vs tortilla option but honestly forgot about it since I was distracted about switching corn for Cole slaw.  When I received my meat I was upset because this time it was very fatty, I didn't receive tortillas or a bun, the macaroni and cheese had none of that amazing flavorful crust or additional seasoning overall it was not the same meal I was completely discouraged and have not eaten here again. I didn't talk to the management about it because I felt uncomfortable with the whole situation. I would not like to be tattling on anyone but was honestly bummed about it."}
{"text":"Place is a gem, food was superb and johns green chili taco recommendation was great. The restaurant was accommodating for my Bears."}
{"text":"Bumped into this place while searching online for a new eatery.  Well, the best accident as far as food we've ever had. Its small, in a sort of average looking strip shopping center but the food, drinks and  staff are just fabulous! Very comfortable booth and seating and just enough ambiance to create a personal experience. The smoked prime rib my hubby had has him raving still the morning after our dinner.  Says its the best prime rib he has ever had no matter what the category, ie upscale, chain etc.  The goat cheese mashed potatoes were velvety smooth and so subtle.  I had the open faced brined turkey sandwich with arugula salad topping and it was just perfect also.  I was curious about the cauliflower steak and it was so good.... topped with chedder cheese and the best jack daniels onions ever!.  They gave us samples of their moonshine, ours was apple pie and believe me it was so smooth and tasty it could be dangerous! We also had two drinks and both were exceptional. We finished things off with a browine topped with ice cream that was very good, moist but not heavy.  So many things on the menu sound so mouth watering we will be going there regularly."}
{"text":"Moonshine aplenty here! They use Ole Smokey in a lot of unique cocktails. Was here before working as event staff and the weekend crowd was definitely rowdy towards the staff ladies so I didn't know if I'd go on a Saturday. Really peaceful during the week. Great happy hour prices.   The patio is warm with 3 heaters and a fireplace but I'd recommend closed toe during nights.   Host was very approachable and accommodating. I believe I spoke with the manager for my order and he was very patient and chill.   We ordered the \"Flapper\" which is basically a strawberry mimosa with Ole Smokey. Pretty good, cute presentation. In addition the pulled pork and honey wings and beef brisket."}
{"text":"Nachos and moonshine were amazing! John provided great service and food recommendations"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for date night - and weren't disappointed.  We had a reservation and were promptly seated and noticed that people were waiting.  Our server (Regina) came over within one minute of our being seated and we asked for more time to consider our order.  The service was excellent - she and other team members were around whenever we needed something.  The moonshine drink I had looked small but was a killer!  Wife had the pulled pork sandwich which was huge and delicious and she couldn't quite finish it.  I had the rack of ribs.  The ribs were a little on the mushy side but had great smoke and flavor.  Again, I couldn't finish the whole rack and took some home.  They were presented nicely - cut apart and stacked.  Coleslaw was excellent - not a glop of mayonnaise that so many restaurants put in front of you.  Fresh and crisp.  So if everything was so good, why only 4 stars?  The seating, that's why.  Our bill (including tip) was over $100 for dinner and drinks and I really expect something more than a hard metal lawn chair at this price point.  They may look industrial and clean, but my 65 year old butt wants a real chair."}
{"text":"Love it! Great food, great service and great ambiance. What more could you ask for? We went here with our friends who are big foodies; the husband said it was the best burger he's ever had! But, all the food was fantastic so I'm not surprised. We went a little later, around 8 p.m., and did not have to wait for a table. Our server was great and the manager was awesome. I'm so happy its near our house so we can visit on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 Stars again due to the service provided by Larry and the other food-runners. We returned with my in-laws and were seated in the corner booth by the bar. We requested Larry again because he is awesome! The macaroni and cheese is one of my favorite as it is so different from others out there. My wife and I got the brisket  and pork tacos to share plus the sweet potato fries, the fries could have been a little hotter, but they were still yummy. The in-laws got the brisket and it was done to perfection. The only thing was one dish was a little more fatty than the other, as that happens with brisket. We ordered the peach cobbler to share and it was hot and tasty. We will be back! The corner booth is the place to sit as you can see all the different drinks being made."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night.  Love the atmosphere.   Service was excellent.  I only ordered cottage fries and the chips and queso dip.  Fries did not seem fresh.  It was weird, some of the fries were hot and some cold.  It was as if they mixed old fries with new.  The chips were delicious but the dip was bland with no seasoning and I could not taste any sort of cheese.   It was pretty bad.  I came here for a drink and not to eat so whenever I want a drink, this is my go to place because the service and the atmosphere was excellent.  Just wish the food was up to par."}
{"text":"There a  couple of things I get excited about and that's Good BBQ and Diners Drive Ins and Dive spots so Bootleggers was an exciting stop for me until I did. We started with drinks in which I think they forgot to put the order in then we ordered the bacon board and chip and guac as appetizers. Come on a bacon board how great is that? The bacon board arrived and at first glance I was disappointed, everything was for overcooked almost burnt. The pork belly was as dry as the Arizona sand. The guac pretty much went un touched and when the waiter came to ask if we were ready to order I said let's wait and see if we get our drinks first. He then placed the order and did apologize. We never did order anything else and Bootleggers was by far the most disappointing DDD place we have ever visited. In hindsight I do feel bad that I did not say anything to the management"}
{"text":"I have been in the restaurant industry for 23 yrs and now in Law Enforcement,  and let me tell you its hard to find good service and good food.    Ryan was our server and he went above and beyond from the time we sat down until we left.  We wanted the manager to know servers like him ..they should clone him.  She told us we have to use his name in our review so he can get some kudos. so here it is \" Ryan, thank you for the great service and we hope to see you again\"    Oh, the food....excellent by the way.  We had street tacos, deviled eggs...and the ribs that were so very tender that we will have to come back for them again.  They demonstrate a great teamwork and you can tell the servers all seem to like being there and get along.   Great Team in every area.  See you soon  Randi Brian A.j"}
{"text":"I went to Bootleggers while I was on Whole30 so, needless to say, the food I ordered was pretty basic. The staff was over the top accommodating to our large group's many dietary needs. From vegans to gluten free folks to even my crazy Whole30 diet, these friendly people made sure everyone got exactly what they wanted, exactly how they wanted it.   I loved that there were several sides that were diet-friendly, including fresh grilled veggies and even mashed cauliflower. This provided some much-needed variety to my meal.    The private dining area is really fun and would be a great place to host a birthday party or other special occasion. Good times!"}
{"text":"We come here to vacation at Pointe Hilton and this is our favorite and first place to visit our first night we hit town. The food is unbelievable! Kiki is awesome and has been our server every time. Everything she has recommended we devoured. Leon is cool, funny, & good looking. Great place and atmosphere. So wish they were in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Best apple pie moonshine ever! Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. The sampler platter is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  We had the BBQ platter.   Best ever and our server, the bartendress, was great.  Go and you will be happy.  It is sort of a drive for us, but not so far we won't be back a lot."}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazing, as is the smell of smoked meat. The service was excellent. The moonshine drink was delicious and strong. The sides were very good.  The BBQ was very disappointing. None of the meat tasted as smokey as the place smelled. Such a letdown compared to everything else about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food AND service. The place was hoppin' and we had no fewer than 3 servers bringing us stuff and checking with us. Noticed they were all helping each other out whenever possible. Had the Bacon Board... artery clogging deliciousness! Also the BBQ platter for 2 where everything was grilled, smoked and seasoned perfectly. Even though I grill veggies best their asparagus was a close second."}
{"text":"Food so good my kids ate it. While the meal was in all ways excellent, the staff was even better. Especially Dani. She was sooooo kind and full of spirit. She made us feel like we were enjoying a night at her home, and not a restaurant. Pricey? Yeah, but worth it. All in all a great evening."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place and so glad we did!!! The sweet corn app was wonderful but be careful it's spicy! My fiancé did the pblt which was fantastic, very simple but great! I had the bootlegger burger, OMG probably one of the best burgers I have had in a long time. It came out cooked perfect super juicy, I recommend using a plate to eat it rather then the board it's served on (presentation is great but juices go everywhere). The pretzel bun was perfect! We shared the Mac n cheese and the cauliflower both delicious! Also the house made chips that come with the sandwiches are yummy!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent along with the moonshine!   Service was very good as well.   The ambiance was a little darker than I expected in the dining area for casual dining, but perfect for the bar area.   4 Stars instead of 5 was for portions.  For what we paid, I was expecting a little more meat for the BBQ for 4... more like for two."}
{"text":"Some of the best damn BBQ I've had, and I have plenty experience eating at Texas smokehouses. Juliana is a phenomenal bartender/server/hostess/person/entertainer/whatever. A must have food stop in Old Town"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is so close to my house and I have been driving by it for months and not realizing what it was.  The location used to be a Dirty Drummer Sports  bar.  Then it was another generic sports bar and I believe it was called Outlaws or something similar.  So when I saw it changed to Bootleggers I naturally assumed it was another bad sports bar.  Then I read in the New Times Best of Phoenix that they won something. I believe it was for Brisket Sandwich or something. I could not believe it.  So I stopped in tonight.  Unfortunately I had already eaten so I just had a few drinks looked at the menu, listened to the other dinners and watched. And watched alot.   I really am looking forward to going back and trying the food.  Everything looked really good. Everyone was talking about the Brisket Nachos so that will be something I look forward to. They had a nice beer selection and a nice little unique thing where they are serving Boutique Moonshine. So that is a thing now.  I remember drinking rock gut homemade whiskey when I visited my brothers in the hills of Arkansas.  Now they are charging $10 for that.  I need to tell the hillbillies to pack up and move to Arizona.  But it was good and something different.   Here is my only complaint about the place and normally this is not a big deal to me.  But they don't have Wifi.  Actually they do but they don't give out the password.  Which is certainly their prerogative but the staff was kind of nasty about it.  LIke \"We have Wifi\" But you can't have it.  It sort of left me a bit put off.  It's 2013 who doesn't have Wifi anymore? If management decides that they only want to use it for management business purposes then I would recommend changing the name of the router to something else.  When I see a router for the business I am in there is a built in expectation that it is available for customer use.  Don't want to offer Wifi as an amenity? No problem, then have your Wifi signal be anonymous.   Looking forward to eating some food there.  But will remember to carry my own Mifi if I feel the need."}
{"text":"So long story short I wrote that bootleggers had potential but missed the mark. The restaurant had just open and I wanted to wait and give it a second chance.   Well I'm pleased to say that I came back and came away very impressed. The apple moonshine is one of the best drinks in town. Notes of apple and cinnamon come together for a fantastic cocktail. We ordered the bacon board, nachos, chicken wings, and Mac and cheese and all were really good. Wings were grilled and had a smokey flavor and were hot but not over bearing. The nachos had some great guacamole and the brisket was cooked well. The bacon board was amazing. There wasn't only 3 very distinguishable bacons, but delicous pork belly and pork confit all served with home made jams, mustard, and cheese bread. Everything was cooked well and very appetizing.   I'm glad I gave bootleggers a second chance and love that we have a new good restaurant in the north Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Bacon Board!!! Bacon sampler appetizer... nuff said. So good! I had the brisket which was just phenomenal. My side of mashed potatoes came in it's own little cast iron with cheese melted on top. Definitely try the moonshine cocktails! Love this place. We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after doing some shopping and were a bit worried after reading some of the reviews about having long wait times, cause we were going a bit late and were Super Hungry. BUT, it was great! We got seated quickly, waiter came over right away, and food came out fast. So no problem with speed. And food was awesome we both loved our dishes. Turkey Melt & PBLT. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"So good, and so very unlike anything else in the area.   You won't believe what Bootleggers looks like inside when you pull into the parking lot of the typical Phoenix strip mall it inhabits just east of the 51. The atmosphere is unisexually appealing and so is the menu of food and drink.  If you are with the guys and you want large portions of meats, go for the ribs or a steak. Get one of the rotating local craft brews to go along with it. If you are out with your girls, get small plates or the bacon board to share and drink some apple pie moonshine or a glass of wine.  You will be seduced by the smoky smells coming from the smoker- which is behind glass near the bar so you can check it out.  If you sit at the bar, say hi to Robin and if you want a sip of something to drink before committing, just ask her."}
{"text":"Really not traditional bbq, but high quality and tasty!  Their ribs are especially delicious. The only caveat is the brisket is not up to par with the rest of the food on the menu.  Highly recommend ending your meal with their apple pie moonshine!"}
{"text":"Here for friend's IronMan and had dinner with the family. Service was amazing and staff was great the kiddos! Food was very tasty and moonshine definitely some of the best I've tried."}
{"text":"I think this is my 2nd Yelp review and I say that because it takes a lot for me to remember to do it for one and then I'm rarely impressed enough to do so. That being said this was my 1st time there this weekend. Food A+ with extra credit as well as the service. Ask for Josh the server, get the brisket sandwich and thank me later."}
{"text":"Hey my gal n I had the bacon board n bbq sampler for 2 plus shine for 100 bucks .. definitely only price n  overrated bbq place .. Try Famous Daves for  better eats and about 2/3rd the price  .. some people don't know what really bbq is .. gee .."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Check Please and wanted to check it out based on the reviews and how awesome the owners came off on the show.  Went with the wife and another couple and it was well worth the drive from Tempe. The Prime Rib was amazing and you get a great portion for the price.  Great Beers on Tap and Moonshine Cocktails available also that all seem very good. I'm a PBR guy myself and they have cans for $3. Awesome!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Bad service!!!! Half the menu they don't serve. Beer was flat and warming by the time it finally made it to the table. Don't bother with this place. The older of the bartenders know his stuff but the rest of the place failed."}
{"text":"Best cheeseburger I have ever had(the bootlegger)! Add the fried egg and it is pure bliss!!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the tv show food paradise. Great choice! Fun environment.  Had three diff tacos, green chili, brisket and pork belly. The green chili pork was a little dry, the pork belly was good but the brisket taco was bomb. Also had the deviled eggs too which were good. Ordered the wings Asian style and those were bomb. Spicy sweet savory! And the green creamy sauce for dipping made for umami in my mouth. My husband got the brisket which was delicious. Also ordered the asparagus side which was way over priced. $7 for about 8 stalks! But it was good but not worth the price. Would definitely come back and order more brisket and wings! :)"}
{"text":"Nice place, quite enough to have a conversation.  Date night dinner shared appetizers, drinks, & entree.  Appetizers were tacos & dumplings.  Very good, especially the dumplings, would get them again.  Entree was shared bbq sampler.  All was good, but ribs we had were pretty fatty with little meat on them, but the pulled pork & brisket were outstanding.  The bbq sauces were absolutely delicious.  Drinks were moonshine cocktails and the best part of the meal.  Would return for the drinks alone.  Biggest tragedy is they have no patio for spring evenings.  Go, eat, drink, enjoy."}
{"text":"Good BBQ place, definitely give the Apple Pie Moonshine a shot."}
{"text":"Open till 1 AM on a Saturday? Um. Chk the times they are Actually NOT open. Height of tourist season and at 12:30 AM it's clear they've been closed for quite some time. Either Yelp needs to tell a better story, and or restaurants owners a better truth? Either way it pretty much is a lousy way to promote your restaurant ..."}
{"text":"One of Old Town's best kept secrets!  Is there anything better than smoked proteins and APPLE PIE MOONSHINE!?  Bacon board, brisket, brisket nachos and the moonshine are all highly recommended!"}
{"text":"OMG... visited the Phoenix and surounding areas, Saw the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives show and Bootlegger's was featured, we had boot dumplings and Mac n'cheese balls, I had the PBLT with sweet potato fries so delicious  couldn't finish (but had someone who could) my husband had the smoked prime beef brisket with Slaw, he enjoyed it immensely... we're from Calif, but WE WILL tell people if in your area to look you up... Very Happy and satisfied"}
{"text":"Delishous!! Great aptmosphere and fun local brews. So happy we stumbled upon Bootleggers! It will be a place we visit again when in Phoenix.."}
{"text":"OMG!! Bacon board is a must have, don't care who you are! It's a must for everyone .  The drinks are good too, along with the BB you have to try their moon shines!  My favorite the apple pie .  Everyone is so nice and customer service oriented, great food and just a great neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Brisket was tough and rubbery. Cobbler was average. Hostess lacked warmth and scruples."}
{"text":"Just had beers and listened to some awesome live music! The smokey meat smell was awesome but had no food. Carried some good beers!"}
{"text":"Came here to check out the BBQ. It was just okay. Service was good. But just not special enough to come back to. I think this place is more for their drinks."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a Friday night. The food was great. It was a bit loud in there, only because there was a live guitarist and people were trying to talk over him. Highly recommend the smoked pork belly and the sampler for 2. The cobbler was great too. Service was top notch as well."}
{"text":"Waited 15 min and no one ever spoke to us and 2 ignored my question about who our server was. Walked out and let someone know and they did nothing. Obviously will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food here is very yummy, but it was the House Made Apple Pie Moonshine that was amazing! Very friendly servers who were excellent at describing items on the menu. This is a nice place to relax, enjoy your time, and sip on great moonshine."}
{"text":"Glad that Bootleggers has become a staple in the neighborhood, great options and great people."}
{"text":"As soon as my boss found out I was coming to Scottsdale for spring training, he immediately recommended Bootleggers.  I came here shortly after a Giants game was over and was surprised there were only a couple people inside.  I got a brisket sandwich which is one of the better ones I can remember ever eating.  The kettle chips weren't as good as the brisket but not awful.  I also tried the pork belly/shrimp dumplings because they were a happy hour special.  They were good, but I wouldn't want to pay full price for them.  Service was very fast and friendly.  I'll definitely come back here if I come to spring training again."}
{"text":"Just back from our 4th visit to this relatively new and very popular BBQ restaurant, which as the potential for 4, or even 5 stars. The ambiance is great, with wood barn paneling on the walls, a nice bar area, a couple of tv's on the back wall. The food is the best BBQ my wife and I have had since leaving our native Virginia and North Carolina. Service is good. So why only three stars? In the 4 times I've been there, they have been out of one of the beers (Lagunitas) on the menu. At the first visit, this was easy to dismiss. By the third visit, it veered in to irritation. And tonight, we had a new menu. No Lagunitas listed, but Dogfish Head instead, a very yummy IPA from Delaware, recently appearing on the draft menus of a few restaurants in the area. I was excited to order it. And guess what? They were out! But they had Lagunitas, we were told, after we had already ordered a Sierra Nevada, bottle. Pretty annoying. Then, when time to order that second beer, which would be a Lagunitas, what happens? They \"popped the keg,\" which means it wasn't available. It would have been good if that was all that was not right. But no, that wasn't all. My wife ordered the ribs, one of the dishes listed under the menu that was to receive a side of cole slaw. The waitress told us that the new menu, just printed, btw, was wrong, and the cole slaw was a side and was extra. As it was listed in the menu, albeit incorrectly, they provided the said side dish, which is delicious. The restaurant manager came over to \"handle\" the situation, proferring the usual PR stuff. I suggested menus are inexpensive to print and that they needed to get them right. We were offered a variety of excuses. Which makes me wonder. How often is this other's experience?  Bottom line, the food is outstanding and the best BBQ we've had in AZ. Downside it lack of attention to detail when it comes to the menu. Just don't expect them to have what they say they do on the beer menu, and be sure of the sides listed to come with your entree. I do hope they can correct this niggling problem and live up to their potential."}
{"text":"Ordered the Short Ribs with a side of Smashed Potatoes. It was exceptional. Bring friends and share the Bacon Platter. Lots of specialty cocktails and beers on tap. Lots of bar seating and patio dining.if you have room for dessert, order the peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Dropped in after a disappointing lunch at restaurant next door. The smell with which one is greeted is phenomenal here!!  Only tried one entree, but it was delicious!  The smoked brisket.  Mmmmm. Comes with a side of coleslaw and tortillas.  The coleslaw would have been perfect without cilantro since I don't enjoy that herb. It wasn't too creamy, which I like."}
{"text":"I was excited a new independent restaurant opened around the corner from my house.   Upon being seated at Bootleggers, my arm stuck to the table. It was difficult to get anyone's attention to come wipe the table. https://www.yelp.com/biz/bootleggers-food-and-drink-phoenix  We ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp appetizer, which was very tasty, yet a very small portion for $10, for 10 marble sized shrimp.   Our dinner was comprised of Beef Brisket, Turkey Leg and Cottage Fries. The cottage fries were horrible. They tasted like they were a cheap brand, frozen from a bag. In fact, I buy frozen Ore-Ida fries that are far superior. These were below school lunch grade. I suggest the Crispy Ore-Ida Crinkle Cuts. They are fantastic.   The Beef Brisket was unlike any I've ever eaten before, and I would never eat this one again. It was cut horizontally, against the grain of the top of brisket. It was one 1/2 inch slice. It looked more like an elongated piece of liver. It was very dry and barely tasted like brisket due to the cut and thickness. The turkey leg was very small, maybe 7\" long and was also quite dry.  I'm no chef, but I can make far superior turkey, brisket and Ore-Ida fries at home.   It seemed that the kitchen was very backed up. All the tables were full and everyone was waiting for their food, as well as the servers were waiting and starring into the kitchen.  It seemed that the kitchen was struggling with preparing food for the bar buffet, and dinner service.  After the bar buffet was replenished, table service began to flow.   Our server was friendly, yet very inattentive. I had to wave my drink several times to get the servers attention for a refill, and then when it came it wasn't what I was drinking.  I gave up on trying to have it corrected. The servers passed quickly through the tables without looking or acknowledging their tables.   The table next to us had issues with their service and getting their full order served as we exchanged exasperated glances. It wasn't until after they were ready to leave that the last dish was finally brought to their table.   I couldn't wait to get out of there. If only I could get the servers attention to bring my check.  Finally the server had brought out about five checks, picked them all up and rang them all out slowly at the same time.   I wish Bootleggers all the luck in the world and hope they can make it, and then make it better."}
{"text":"We stopped in today because it was featured on #TripleD .I'm not sure what Guy was served but what we had beef brisket and pulled pork. Both were dry and zero flavor. The baked beans were so dry they were inedible.  On top of that our oriantal bartender was so inattentive she never checked on us or filled our drinks then the kicker is she asked if we stole a shot of something that had come up missing. When I tried to confirm what she had said she got offended and said she was just joking of stealing it. We were so offended. We don't need to steal shots of liquor.. please! It's not you liquor.  If something comes up misplaced pour another dont accuse your customer of stealing it. We were so offended at her behavior we left with no tip for her. Not impressed at all. Avoid this place. We are deserving of a apology!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here but it was just ok. On a Friday night, we got to sit right away. We had drinks and split the smoked turkey. It was moist but sorta bland. The portions were so small for how expensive it was. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Bootleggers is an interesting take on the classic American comfort food of BBQ, in that they're trying to fancy up a cuisine that's known more for licking fingers and swigging beer than fancy tablecloths. The place came highly recommended by my sister--who's no BBQ aficionado, but certainly knows good food when she sees it. They're conveniently located in Old Town Scottsdale, so they're a perfect place to stop and load up on the calories to fuel your shopping spree. I ordered my set standard of the combo plate so I could taste all of Bootleggers smoked meats.  BBQ Sampler:  Sides- The Sampler plate comes with Coleslaw and Tortillas; nothing really special here as both seemed pretty standard to me. I would've preferred they add one more side to the meal, but whatever. 3*  Meats:  Brisket- This was by far my favorite meat here at Bootleggers; excellent smoky flavor and I liked the rub they use. My only critique is it was a bit dry. 4.5*  St. Louis Ribs- These were also excellent; great smoke that didn't overpower the pork and they were super juicy. Unfortunately, the rub was a bit too salty for my taste. 4*  Pulled Pork- Juicy, Porky and a great rub. I didn't really get much smoke from it, though--I think they had too much BBQ Sauce on there and it kinda overpowered it for me. 4*  Schreiner's Hot Links- I was happy to see Bootleggers makes their own Hot Links; that's pretty rare these days. I thought they were pretty good, but I would've liked more spice to them. 3.5*  Turkey- Good rendition of Smoked Turkey that wasn't overly dried-out and had a nice smoky flavor that didn't over power that Turkey flavor we all crave. 3.5*  Service & Ambiance- Service was pretty good; our waitress was very friendly and the food came out quickly, but I think she kinda forgot about us there for a bit towards the end. Bootleggers pulls off the whole fancy BBQ thing fairly well as the place is really nice without being overly cloying. There is still a bit of a rustic ambiance to it, and I highly recommend sitting on the patio by their fabulous smoker--I love the smell of smoked meat in the morning. 3.5*-Service/4.5*-Ambiance  Value- I think the BBQ Sampler is actually a very good value at $32--it's more than enough food for two people and $16/head is pretty good for a BBQ place. 4*  I liked Bootleggers quite a bit; my only qualm is I wish they would serve their BBQ Sauce on the side instead of pre-slathering all their meat for you. I like my Q East Texas-Style: dry rub only and sauce on side. Also, I think this would be one of the few BBQ spots that could pull off a romantic Date Night--just saying. If you're in the Old Town Scottsdale area and are hankering for some good Q, then Bootleggers is the place for you."}
{"text":"I rarely give a 5 star review. Good food, fun menu, big portions, interesting liquor and quick service. A bit hipster doofus, but a nice evening."}
{"text":"After the baseball game, we walked over here for some grub.  I have had the place bookmarked for awhile, but I'm never down this way.  Until tonight......  We walked in and there was no hostess.  We stood there for a minute and it seemed like a \"seat yourself\" type of place.  We walked to the back room, sat down at a table, and then sat..and waited...and waited.  Probably after close to 10 minutes, a waiter came by and asked if we had been helped.  We told him no, and then he started to help us.  To his credit, he did apologize about the mix up and from his apology, we probably should have had someone seat us so that the waiter/waitress in that section, knows that someone new has arrived.  Anyways....looked over the menu and decided to go with the pork belly tacos, and an order of nachos to split.  My buddy went with some deviled eggs and the brisket tacos.  Here is how they were........  Nachos-  These things were pretty damn delicious!  They serve these to you in a small cookie sheet.  They are topped with a GRIP of brisket, cheddar cheese, chipotle cheddar sauce, avocado relish, jalapenos and cilantro.  The chips were crispy, the cheese nicely melted, the brisket was moist and super plentiful...good smoke flavor...the chipotle cheddar sauce wasn't that great.  It kind of hardened up and congealed a bit.  It didn't ruin the nachos, but they may have been better without that cheese sauce.  I would get these again.  It was a huge serving!  Perfect for sharing, or just getting one as your meal!  Pork Belly Tacos-  These things were TINY! 3 street taco sized tacos.  They were topped with pickled onions and some avocado.  Um...they were just ok.  The pork belly tasted alright, but it was a little bit softer than other pork bellies I have had.  Each taco was 2 bites.  I don't think I would get them again.  Happy hour, maybe.  Full price ($12.00), probably not.    Brisket Tacos-  Me and my buddy did a taco trade.  I had one of his brisket tacos and gave him one of my pork belly ones.  The brisket taco was meh.  The brisket was incredibly dry!  The brisket on the nachos was nice and moist, but the tacos were dry as can be.  Not impressed at all.  Definitely wouldn't order again.  Deviled Eggs-  $6.00 for 1.5 eggs.  They serve you 3 halves.  My buddy was joking, \"Where the hell is my other half of the egg?\".  At least serve 4 pieces for $6.00.  He said they were good, but he also said, \"You can't really fuck up a deviled egg...and when are deviled eggs not good?\".  True!  Service was good after the initial mishap.  Our waitress was very nice and accommodating.  She did make one weird move though.  We had another buddy meet us there near the end of our meal.  He ordered a certain type of beer.  She returned with a different type of beer.  Turns out they were out of the one he ordered, but she brought him the \"closest thing to it\".  I have never seen someone bring out a totally different drink than the one ordered..at least without checking first or asking if it was ok.  That's like running out of Mountain Dew and bringing a Sprite in its place.  Sure, they are both sodas, but they are also nothing like each other.  He drank it, and said it was ok, but he was puzzled on how a server could pull something like that.  Anyways................  Food was decent but a little bit expensive for the portion size.  Not sure if I would come back on my own, but if someone wanted to go here, I might give them another shot.  We were there really late too (9:30pm), and they stop serving food at 10pm.  Maybe we didn't get the best of what Bootleggers has to offer?  Maybe I will find out next time?  Maybe I won't?  Barely 3 stars."}
{"text":"We come here often. Mostly we enjoy the happy hour at the bar. Recently we went in only to find Robin, one of the better bartenders, had left. It was a major disappointment as her ability to make a cocktail was awesome. We miss you Robin!"}
{"text":"My pulled pork sandwich at Bootleggers wasn't fatty. \"Fatty\" implies some sort of holy union between tender shreds of protein and slow-cooked, melty lipid. Fat was on one side of the arena. Protein was on the other. I was picking wads of cholesterol-flavored chewing gum out from between the kaiser roll, which was very soft and brioche-y (you know, to enhance the mushy fat aspect of the experience.)  Now look, I ain't a bitch. I like fat. I also like chips, so you know there's a problem when the greasiness from the chips is actually about to saturate and capsize the sandwich. Few things deter me from putting chips on a sandwich.  Moving on from the first-world problems and onto the first world solutions, the coleslaw on the sandwich was excellent in all the ways. The pork itself, as well as the flavor, was good. I actually found the huge, unshredded chunks to be the best part, since I didn't have to worry about trimming them first.   SPOILER ALERT: Happy ending! Basically, my persnicketry saved me from expelling food in public or having to go get a coronary artery bypass graft. (Day ruiner, am I right?) So naturally I got a blueberry & peach cobbler with ice cream afterwards. Super sweet, very comforting, and the topping was made of mutilated cinnamon toast crunch. Novel."}
{"text":"Bootleggers disappointed with a so-so appetizer and outdated menu.   Menu issues entailed having a beer list and no beer. It's even on their website so I'm not understanding, but the bartender explained that they didn't have that. Okay, earlier we had a fabulous dinner with friends at RA and had excellent parking nearby so we stopped in for a cocktail anyways. I was excited by the fun, interesting cocktail names and solicited advise from the bartender in choosing between the bumpy bramble and the lonestar mule (I heart Moscow mules but only if they're made with a gingery ginger beer). The bartender joked there's a 2 drink minimum so I can try them both. HA. My husband ordered the hanky panky. (see fun names).   The cocktails were made quickly (an underwhelming bar crowd for a Friday night in Scotsdale). They tasted fresh and were really good. Everything seemed like Bootleggers was doing a good job filling the space previously occupied by the Monk (we miss the Monk). The mule was tasty. There was some confusion behind the bar with the two bartenders vying over space, despite there being plenty of room. Not sure what the dynamic was, but it was a little strange.   Then we ordered the chips and dips looking for something salty, crunchy, and cheesy. Hand cut russets, Gouda cheese dip, smoke bacon bits, green onion - sounds great right? NOPE. Terrible. The cheese dip tasted like an unseasoned, under-cheesed roux. The chips were crisp, but also greasy and not able to withstand the dip before breaking, much less having the property of being able to also scoop a benton bacon bit. What a disappointment to have a dull chips and dip. We pretty much ate the bacon (smokey, chewy, not too bad) and left the dip and chips alone after trying a few bites. It never improved.  Despite other reviews demonstrating that the smoked meats and bacon are worth a shot, I doubt we will return based on the inability to deliver a decent simple dish such as chips and dip."}
{"text":"We had dinner and drinks here on 3/24/18 with our friends.  First thing, even though their website says they do not take reservations for parties under 6, apparently that is incorrect; the hostess told me upon arrival that they do accept reservations for any party size and was surprised their website said differently.  So, call to make reservations.   Our server was professional and gave very generous pours of wine.  Three of us had their smoked prime rib - it was excellent!  Food and drink prices were reasonable for Scottsdale and its a nice casual vibe.  After dinner our server treated us to some apple pie moonshine - very tasty!   We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I ate a pound of the most delicious meat to myself the night I dined here. I wanted to stop, but it was so good I kept eating. If you love some really good, authentic barbeque, then you have GOT to try this place. It's costs a pretty penny but if you have the funds to support a nice night out at a restaurant, this should be your first pick.  I was with my boyfriend, his parents, and his roommate. My boyfriend, his roommate, and I couldn't decide what to order because all the options seemed so good. Then at the top of the menu something caught our eye...The BBQ Sampler. It serves either two people or four and we had three so we said go big or go home and got the sample for four. It ended up working out perfectly eating with two grown men, we finished the whole thing.   It's a tie between the beef brisket, pulled pork, and the ribs for me. I loved all of them! My boyfriend and his roommate loved the turkey breast and said it was some of the best turkey breast they have ever had. We went half and half on the tortillas and rolls, both delicious, however, they are homemade tortillas and I liked them a little more! The coleslaw was probably some of the yummiest coleslaw I've ever had. I wish I could have gotten my own order of that!   The staff was very friendly and helpful. I noticed they have a happy hour with tacos and great prices so I think next time I head back and pay for myself, I will hit up their happy hour!"}
{"text":"After a run on the trail on 40th St trail, me and a buddy decided to stop by Bootleggers tonight to recharge with some food and beer.  This was our first time at the restaurant.  It has a pretty cool atmosphere and the staff was friendly,and initially attentive.   Everything seemed promising until 10 minutes passed before anybody took our drink order.  We waited an additional 10 to 15 minutes to order food and then a excessive amount of time for the food to arrive.  I'm not an impatient person when it comes of food service and can also understand long waits if the restaurant is slammed.  Bootleggers was not overly busy and we spotted our waitress talking casually with other staff or doing nothing at all.   She made no attempt to ask for drink refills or provide an apology for the long wait.  Fortunately the wings and nachos we ordered we outstanding, and the beer selection is good.  I wish I could give 4 or 5 stars, but the poor service makes that impossible.  I will give it another chance though."}
{"text":"Went here last night and was very disappointed. Not only was the portion size very small for the sampler platter to be shared for 2 people, our waitress also told us the wrong daily special twice! The food wasn't terrible but we should have known to walk out when at 6:30 the restaurant was almost empty. Our food came out very quick and was cold. Very disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"They had very good food, service and cocktails. I just thought their portions were too small."}
{"text":"Went to Bootleggers on a whim last night because my brother was in town from California. I am so glad we decided to try it. The food was so delicious. We got the sampler for two and a side of macaroni and cheese. It was a perfect portion for two. My brother got the brisket and sweet potato fries. The maple aioli with the fries was drinkable. The service was great too and the decor was awesome. The apple pie moonshine was like a dessert too. Tasted like we were drinking liquid apple pie. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Bootleggers for the first time last night and had a pretty good experience which is reflective of four stars.  First the good: - Food was excellent! My girlfriend and I shared the pulled pork with coleslaw and both were great. The meat was tender and not overly saucy, just the way I like it. Our other plate was the Cobb Kale which was really good too. They give you two sides of salad dressing to help drown out the raw kale taste which can be overpowering if you're not use to kale. Could use a bit more massaging on the kale to give it a softer feel but overall solid.   The Bad: - So annoying but customer service. We arrived and saw plenty of tables open but yet there was a 10-15 minute wait? Don't mind the wait but when there's open tables?! Come on guys, this is basic 101 stuff of running a restaurant. We ended up sitting at the bar and it was a bit of a struggle to get a drink and order, almost like the bar tender was doing us a favor for taking our order. We didn't complain or anything but we notice stuff like this. And we were not the only customer being treated like this.   Summary: Worth going for the food and hope you get good service. We'll try it again but with all the new restaurants coming up in Old Town, it might get kicked to the back of the list."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant! The moonshine cocktails were amazing, especially the blue moon with blueberry and basil. The bacon platter appetizer was an assortment of unique and exquisite tasting bacon, bread and relishes. The French dip, brisket and prime rib get 5 stars from our group. We're gonna be back! Many thanks to our attentive, energetic, photographer and fun server, Dana!"}
{"text":"This is a new family favorite for sure!  And for a picky family that is saying a lot.   We came here for my sister-in-law's birthday - 4 adults and two kids under 5.  Everything was amazing! We got seated in a huge corner booth with lots of room. We ordered mac and cheese and a grilled cheese right away for the kids and (2) of the moonshine cocktails - which were both excellent.   For appetizers we got a guacamole and honey siracha wings. Both great - wings were hot!   The kids food came out right away which was perfect while we waited for our entrees - I got a French dip which was huge and maybe the best French dip I've ever had.  I upgraded my side to \"cottage fries\" which were sliced round potato coins, if you will. Super yummy.   Others ordered the half-rack of ribs, pulled pork sandwich and brisket tacos. Everyone seemed to love their meal. The waiter treated us to a Jack Daniels brownie and ice cream for dessert (minus the JD so the kids could have some). It was great! I imagine amazing in the adult version.  And not only the food was great but the service and atmosphere perfect too! It was busy but not too loud you couldn't hear. And the 4-member live band was a great addition. After our dinner the kids loved sitting up and watching them for 4-5 songs before we left!   Would be great for families or date night!!"}
{"text":"Been a while since we had good cow! This place has really good ribs, the prime rib was super juicy, and the goat cheese mashed was very good! Big fan of the horseradish sauce. Been a while since we had good BBQ and this place did not disappoint. Overall very good!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pulled pork sandwich the BBQ sauce to meat ratio was perfect. Meat was very tender. Husband ordered brisket tacos from happy hour menu and said they were a little over done, however still tasted good. Sweet potato fries were nothing to rave about and only served Pepsi products. Looks like an awesome place to come for a drink. The atmosphere is rustic and really relaxing. I love the candles on each of the tables and the Edison lightbulbs for lighting."}
{"text":"The only reason this is a low rating is because if the bar service and how that was handled. The food is great, our service was good. We went on Wine Wednesday but was told non of the \"Amy bottles of wine\" were included. Since we came for a celebration we were put out by it. Sadly they didn't handle it well. Note: take everything with an asterisk. Some entrees are a la cart and some wines don't count."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I've been here couple times now. I've tried the brisket, Ribs, burger, wings & there amazing Nachos with brisket on it. Everything, every time is good. Service is always excellent. My husband says they make a great old fashion as well. Love this place. We will be back again. Guarantee good food."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location in downtown Scottsdale. Old town. Once you walk in you can't miss the large bar and on the right hand side is the dining area. We were a group of 6 and got seated right away in a very comfortable booth. We started with some drinks. And moved on to the brisket nachos which were amazing. Even the chips were thin and fresh. I ordered the brisket and my husband who can eat ribs every single day of course got the ribs. Both were fantastic. My husband said that his ribs had lots of meat on it. Our food came with cold slaw and Tortilla or biscuit. Get the biscuit. Everyone at our table loved the place and the food. & service was great. Highly recommend this new place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday after the farmers market.  I am writing this review because the brisket sandwich I had was simply terrific.  If it wasn't the best sandwich I ever had, I can't really remember a better one.  The thing about this sandwich is that all of the flavors stood out.  Starting with the white cheddar cheese, which you could really taste, through the caramelized onions and tomatoes to the brisket itself.  Even the bun was tasty.  On the side were kettle chips.  Unlike most such chips, which are thick and hard to eat, these were wafer thin and just delicious.  My wife had the pulled pork sandwich, which she liked.  I would tell you more about how it tasted, but she ate every last bit of it before I could get a bite.  Of course, it isn't like I offered her any of my brisket sandwich, so I can't complain.  Anyway, I really loved that brisket sandwich and I recommend that you try it, too."}
{"text":"We took the barbecue platter for two and every single piece was delicious. Platter comes with sauces and a small salad. Atmosphere is western cowboy style with modern twist"}
{"text":"I like to think we bought our house in the area mainly because I want to eat here all the time. Ok, that is a flat out lie, but if I were wealthy enough to own multiple homes, I would absolutely purchase one around these parts just because this place rules. I've come here multiple times with the hubs & various friends, and each time the place has failed to disappoint. They have a great cocktail menu, plenty of delicious beers on tap, and the food has been 100% awesome 100% of the time. Cole slaw? Heck yeah. Pulled pork? You better believe it. This is worth the drive from ANY part of the valley. Don't be turned off by the fact that this is in a shady, ill-lit strip mall - I promise it's way different inside. Oh, and also don't be turned off by the fact that it's next to some fitness place. You may feel depressed when you walk out all fat and sassy and see people sweatin' to the 80s next door, but I swear the food is worth it and that feeling will pass."}
{"text":"We drove for about 30 minutes to try this place overall our experience was decent just some observations. Not sure the Bootleggers Burger is worth 16bux also not sure a preztle bun is the best bun for that burger. It does look good but the utility if actually eating it is a bit harder than it needs to be. Also if you order a beer at least offer glassware because I'm not paying for a craft beer if I have to drink it out of the can that's not good customer service or a way to showcase your premium products. Also I subbed fries and got chips but got charged for fries... Our waiter didn't seem very attentive but wasn't bad overall I just expect more for the price on a place like this. Still not a bad experience just won't be revisiting."}
{"text":"We decided to go here after seeing the special about it on the food channel. It definitely lives up to the hype. Our server was amazing; she offered recommendations and was very lively and talkative. I decided to get the boot bomb, the chef's special. It was the best barbecue I've ever had. Pork, pork, and more pork."}
{"text":"I'm torn. I can't honestly tell you if this was a 3 or 4 star experience.  I'm a firm believer that food will always taste better when the service is good. So from a service aspect we had pretty damn good service considering we sat at the bar (served by an older bartender who completely handled that section)....so there's 4 star decision.  Another 4 stars for style (think industrial brick and mortar meets velvet booths with orange accents). They also do a great job giving you 3 different ambiances in one space (dining at a table, communal tables in the bar or a nice patio area).   The food was a solid 3 stars which was the biggest bummer. We came here hoping for some great bbq...The prices are comparable to similar concepts ($18 for brick chicken or a bbq pork shoulder) but the food took forever and was cold when it arrived. The plates were small; our appetizer was 3 pieces the size of pot stickers for $15. From the time we ordered to getting our dinner took about 40 minutes post rush and wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't cold when it arrived. We were hungry so we just dealt with it. The food tasted bland, the broccolini was over cooked and cold, potatoes cold, chicken cold, pork cold. Mac and cheese was damn good....but cold.  Honestly, the best thing on the menu was the overpriced appetizers and the drinks.  I would revisit for the drinks and ambiance but I wouldn't visit for dinner again."}
{"text":"Excellent! Nachos and Cobb salad fantastic... Anything with pork belly has to be good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a couple of drinks during happy hour before a painting party class. I ordered the brisket taco and the veggie taco along with a well margarita. The brisket taco was outstanding! It was so good I ordered a second one. The veggie taco was pretty good, although the poblano pepper needed a little salt or something.  Even though I ordered the regular  margarita with well tequila, that is shown to be $5 on the happy hour menu, I was charged $1.50 extra because it was a margarita. The server couldn't really give us a good explanation and the manager left the extra charge on the ticket. :-\"}
{"text":"We had a booth for 6 on a Friday evening and was greeted right away and seated as soon as we arrived. The waitress Kailey was exceptional. She recommended the chicken sandwich and the pulled pork was excellent. Our drinks were always tapped off and she was always close by if we needed anything. The prices were reasonable. We will be back"}
{"text":"Location...so so Ambiance/decor ....solid Staff.....fantastic Menu....so many decisions/great options.  Food....yum.  Wings, salad, sides, tacos...all delicious. Intangibles: beer list, prices, tvs, music, etc...all spot on. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a hidden secret!!!! This place is amazing!!! Dana our waitress was off the charts great!!!! Cozy, low lighting, great atmosphere, low noise level for group conversation.  Ask for Dana, she is a sweetheart!!!! She offers great suggestions and is the perfect hostess.  The food is so tasty and good!!!"}
{"text":"Until recently, this was one of our favorite neighborhood joints.  We were happy for their success as the place is busy every night. Sadly, our visit this week may be our last. They scaled down their menu and seriously raised their prices on drinks and food! Dinner for 2...2 rounds Absolute rocks, shared pulled pork and kale salad...over $70!  I love the food, but not that much. Bye bye Bootleggers :("}
{"text":"Definitely a very nice atmosphere representing a smokehouse. Bar does have drinks like moonshine and even created some of their own to blend well. I had the bacon board which has a few different flavors of bacon to try along with pork beef and bread. I wouldn't say it's the best option for dinner but at night time if you are looking for drinks this would be one top notch place to go to."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are top notch. Like a diamond in the rough you would never know how great this place is based on the strip mall it sits in. Do yourself a favor and check out the pulled pork sandwich. Amazing!  Can't wait to come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"I went to Bootleggers with my family for my family bday dinner. We sat on their patio and it was very nice out there, cool, quiet, and simply (but attractively) decorated with sunflowers on the tables. We had a party of 8 and they handled the party well. I got to try many items, some were great, some were mediocre, but overall it was good. Here is the rundown:  For a drink I got the hemingway daiquiri...it was very fresh and tasty. I thought it was a bit overpriced, but at least it tasted good.   For food I got to try:  Bacon plate - really good - lots of different types of bacon with some delicious mustard and roasted red peppers. My problem with it was the waiter didn't explain the dish...we didn't know which bacon was which...that's not cool.   Bootlegger burger - ehhh not as good as I would hope considering the components. It lacked a lot of flavor when you would think it'd be great (it has cheese, bacon, whiskey onions, etc...sounds great, wasn't so great). I think they should put some bbq on this burger and it would be greatly improved.   Pulled pork - delicious! so tender, tasty, great bbq sauce. It tasted especially good in the house made tortillas.   Ribs- not so good. These would be good if cooked a bit longer, but they were tough and stuck to the bone....not what you're looking for in a good rib and difficult to eat.   smashed potatoes- these things were great, very cheesy tasting and savory.   Grilled cauliflower steak - this was very good...covered in cheese and onions, I could have this for a meal.   Mac and cheese- good, but run of the mill, nothing too special.   Asparagus- nicely charred and tasted good with the lemon zest.    Unfortunately, they didn't have their bacon cake (which was kind of the reason I wanted to go here), but overall the restaurant was good. I would give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"The deviled eggs alone make it worth coming in to this place! We came in for Happy Hour and our bartender Chase was awesome! He greeted us as soon as we walked in, made an amazing Dirty South cocktail and was very attentive and personable during our entire visit.   We got a Cobb salad, deviled eggs and salmon tacos and everything was amazing. Like I said before the deviled eggs are out of this world. The Cobb salad was really good with the pork belly perfectly smoked. The salmon tacos were some of the best fish tacos I have had in a while. Started out with 3 and ordered 3 more because they were so amazing.   We were also able to try their Apple Pie Moonshine and it was way too good. Perfect after dinner drink and very delicious. Tasted just like apple pie without being too sweet and had a kick to it without being to strong.   I highly recommend checking this place out. I'm so excited to come back and try some more of the entrees."}
{"text":"The food was excellent the first time we went there...the service was slow. The food was excellent the second time we went there...the service was slower. The food was excellent the third time we went there...and the service was horrible. If you want PBR and good food...try it. If you want good service - stay away."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to some bar b que ribs tonight. However, after seating us and ordering drinks, they tell us there are no ribs tonight. What kind of bbq place doesn't have ribs?  Next, we order fries- oops! Sorry, they don't have those tonight either.  Really?!  We ordered the bbq sampler, which included 2 ribs and so we asked how would that order be handled. We were told the chef would substitute the ribs to his preference. Really?! How about our preference or giving us some options? I had to point that out before we were offered some options.  Finally, the two stars are for the food, which turned out to be pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but still good."}
{"text":"The best happy hour tacos! They won at the taco festival in Scottsdale. They not only have a great menu but also a cool vibe. You have got to check it out! Go in and ask for Larry, he will take great care of you. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Kale salad was delicious.  Great selection of craft draft beer, whiskey, and other liquor.  Great bartender, great late night spot.  Kitchen is open until 10 for the full menu."}
{"text":"I was surprised that the menu was somewhat minimal when it comes to the meats they offer. Out of Hot Link and Turkey. Settled for pulled pork and brisket. Brisket was good while a bit fatty, pulled pork I found almost inedible do to being mostly fat. I mentioned it to the waitress and she excused it by saying the normal cook/cutter was not there. Nothing special having come from Texas"}
{"text":"Only giving it a star because I am unable to start this with review. Prices are not what shows up on yelp. Horrible service when calling she was unable to tell me if they had reservations available nor how long their wait would be. Poor planning when sitting they customers, no sense of urgency. They are also unable to correctly communicate with each other. Would never consider coming back. Horrible environment, decor and horrible seating. The serving sizes where not what they should be for the prices."}
{"text":"Best deviled eggs I've ever had. Plus they have a great happy hour all day on Sunday. food is excellent! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, food was a bit slow, but really really good. We were sat down next to two large groups, so it was VERY loud. If it were quieter it would have been a very nice dinner. 3 outta 5 stars."}
{"text":"YUM! Stumbled upon this restaurant when the wait was too long across the street. Everything from the ambiance to the service to the food was outstanding. We had the brisket entree, pulled pork sandwich and the beet salad. All so good. Also the mac and cheese and the smashed goat cheese potatoes were delish! Definitely would recommend this place to anyone looking for good BBQ!"}
{"text":"Looks like they have an awesome food menu. I just come for the drinks.  Fantastic late night bartenders / super friendly and knowledgable - they really take pride in their craft cocktail presentation. Seriously - this place can satisfy the most high maintenance of bitches. I love the patio and the overall ambience if the place - seems like a lot of service industry people favor the place and that's always a good sign. Best Moscow mule in town.... hope they replace their copper mugs that were stolen soon - hate drinking those out of glasses. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this place. Consistently good food and great happy hour. Definitely suggest trying the smoked salmon starter - smoky and sweet and freaking tasty if you like that kinda thing!  Came here on a Friday night and they had an amazing band playing. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was awesome!! My chicken sandwich was delicious and I highly recommend paying the extra few dollars for their pickled French fries. They're bomb. Was kind of disappointed in the serving size of the fries though. Also the serving size of the deviled eggs.. 3 halves of an egg is a little small for $6. Overall great experience. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Pulled pork, pork belly sandwich both excellent. Gonna be a tough neighborhood for them to do the kind of business they are hoping for but I wish them well. I will certainly go back"}
{"text":"We went to Bootleggers and it wasnt too busy. I almost wondered why it took 10 minutes to be greeted by our waiter. We ordered mac n cheese for the kid. Its was ok. My wife and I had a moscow mule. Pretty good. I had the brisket plate. The brisket was good. The side were just ok. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? The wife got the french dip. Ok again. I always give restaurants 2 chances, so I will be back to try other stuff. Other than that, ok but not great. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"First visit and won't be the last. The beef brisket plate with house slaw just melts in your mouth. Best of all is the service, the waiters know just what to recommend."}
{"text":"Came here twice. Once for drinks and once for food. The drinks are very tasty! Try their house made apple pie moonshine! DELISH. The smoked chicken wings are mouthwatering!! Perfect smoky flavor and perfect crunch on the outside and tender on the inside. I've never had smoked wings before and I think I don't want them any other ways. These were my favorite! I also had the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad which was good but nothing special. The potato salad looked like mayonnaise soup which I really didn't like. Since I loved the wings so much I will for sure come back. They bacon board looks amazing! I mean who doesn't like bacon?? On Sundays they also serve a Bloody Mary served with a slider on top! How cool is that?! The decor is awesome! Definitely looks like an old saloon and also has their smoker visible for everyone to see. I hope to be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Finally something cool opened up in this location. I vote they bulldoze they entire block and expand an outdoor bar / restaurant. Good beer and good food so far."}
{"text":"Loved it. The staff was so friendly and courteous! We ordered the nachos and the pulled pork. Both were delicious but the highlight was the Sunday Bloody Mary. The $15 price tag might scare you off. Don't let it! Served in an oversized mason jar with a side of lite beer and topped with an artisan bacon cheeseburger slider, this new take on an old classic is truly seminal."}
{"text":"Bacon board was a fun wait to start. craft beer on tap rotates and slow roasted brisket was great staff was very friendly and fun"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! Great service, amazing bbq! We came here our first week in Arizona and it has become our favorite date night spot."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem. The bbq is outstanding and the drinks are even better. They're known for their moonshine and you can try little samples! Apple pie is the best one!"}
{"text":"Had to stop in here to try the flight of moonshine...well worth it! Went in at 3:30 on a Monday. One other couple at the bar, great bartender, Kevin, gave us the scoop on fun local places. The brisket tacos were ah-mazing. Decor was rustic and very clean! Kevin gave us a sample of the leftover peach cobbler moonshine they had made for an event and it was so good! Definitely glad we stopped in during the happy hour time!"}
{"text":"First off let me say I'm always looking for new restaurants. This place is by far the best restaurant I've been to in a long time. The chicken wings are a must try for starters and the corn is right up there. I ordered the St. Louis ribs were very good I tried the brisket and I was amazed at just how good it was. Our waiter Alex made our family experience complete. If you read this please go eat here you won't be disappointed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5  It's going to be hard to impress a Tennessean with BBQ that's not from/in a southern state but Bootleggers gets an 'A' for effort... and for moonshine. I didn't know what to expect when walking through the doors on a surprisingly chilly Wednesday night but tptb at Bootleggers was already on top of it, having heaters strewn about the dining room. If you're not happy with the service at Bootleggers, you're probably very hard to impress. I experienced a meal full of smiles and suggestions. Despite waiting on a large group, the servers never appeared stressed, harried or cranky. They definitely added to the experience.  Also starting things off on a right note: the chips & guacamole. It sounds basic. It tasted incredible. My table fought over the app. I would have made more of a valiant attempt to eat them all if I weren't already a few glasses deep in to the moonshine. Again, as a Tennessean, it's nice to see other people appreciate moonshine (even if mass produced, bottled and expensive moonshine isn't 'moonshine'). Bootleggers has some good stuff at the ready. I'd suggest sipping it. Shooting it is a bad idea that will lead to bad decisions and a rough morning. For my meal, I opted for the pulled pork. I don't eat a lot of pork these days but I was looking for a gluten-free option that wouldn't cause a lot of waves. Pulled pork, it was. I received a mountain of food. If you leave Bootleggers hungry, there's a medical issue. My pork was good. I thought the texture was a tad fatty/mealy but I know people who prefer their shoulder that way. For being a smokehouse, I didn't get a ton of smoke from the meat but thought that the sauces (try 'em all) amplified the base flavor of the meat. The sauce wasn't there to mask anything. The fries that came with were inoffensive and pleasant. I would have preferred a touch more aggressive seasoning but, again, I realize mileage may vary.  I thought this area of Scottsdale was more lively than the Entertainment District in which I was staying. If back in the area, I'd like to explore the options more in depth. And, if back in the area, I'd probably come back for moonshine, guac and service with a smile."}
{"text":"We ordered ribs to go and when we went to pick them up the staff didn't even acknowledge me. Took about 10 mins before they actually brought over my food - which they didn't even ask if I was there to pick up food. The ribs weren't amazing. Felt like they were made from a neighbor's backyard. Was hoping that they would be fall off the bone kind of ribs but they were definitely not."}
{"text":"Ok food, poor service.  Was in the mood for good bbq, and this place had mixed reviews.  We went early (2 adults/3 kids) to avoid the rush, and got a table at 5:30.  Couldn't sit outside because they had large group out there. But atmosphere was awesome,  so didn't care.   Kids ordered chicken fingers, we ordered pulled pork and 1/2 rack of ribs.  45 MINUTES before we saw dinner.   At 40 minutes, I asked waitress, but was told \"it's only been 20 minutes, and that's normal.\"  But, she either forgot to put order in, or put it in late, because it was truly 45 minutes.   When we finally got served, diners were cold.   We asked for them to be heated, and waited another 10 minutes.   Waitress seemed to care less. No acknowlegement, apology, or updates.    If you have kids, and a \"no phone policy\" at the table, you know 45 - 55 minutes is a LONG time to wait.     Food was ok, albiet still cold.  Good portion size of ribs for a 1/2 rack, and pulled pork was good.   But its wasn't great, and certainly not worth the wait.  Won't return.  Too many options nearby.  Take your family to R&R instead."}
{"text":"They have mediocre covered! The best thing was the music they played and the bartender told me it was Pandora.  I had the cauliflower steak.  At a smoke house I would think it would be charred and full of smokey flavor.  This cauliflower never saw a grill.  It was baked in a cast iron dish with cheese and grilled onions.  Eh.  The beet salad must have had two whole slices of beet.  I gave them a shot at redemption by ordering what sounded amazing.  A whisky brownie a la mode.  Eh once again. What could have been amazing was just mediocre.  SERIOUSLY MEDIOCRE."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim and was super glad we did! Just walking in and smelling what was cooking let us know how good of a meal we were in for! The staff was super nice and accommodating. Excellent food and awesome cocktails. Be sure to try the Apple pie moonshine before you leave!"}
{"text":"Nice people but you don't eat the people. It was slow in there on a Friday night at about 9 which should have been the tip off. Food was definitely a letdown. Pulled pork was dry and stringy. Cole slaw dry and tasteless. Served up with a thimble of meh barbecue sauce. Wife had the Bootlegger burger. It was an okay burger. I guess. Expensive okay burger served up with a bowl of potato chips. Exciting - not. Service was s-l-o-w but friendly once our waitress arrived. But the food was just not worth waiting for. So two stars and plenty of other new 'cue in town to try.   Adios, Bootleggers, maybe we came on the wrong night but for what we paid there's wayyyy better out there!"}
{"text":"I owe a debt to a friend for recommending Bootleggers to me. The first time I came here was for AZ Restaurant Week. I was absolutely bowled over. When I came in and said I wanted to see the Restaurant Week menu, the waitress took the menu out of my hands. I said \"Wait, I wanted to choose something.\" Then she said \"No, you get EVERYTHING.\" What?? Can this be?! Everything was delicious but the cuteness of the tasting proportions was deceptive. I was almost stuffed after the first course! The first plate had a mini grilled cheese and turkey sandwich, a baked potato soup and a very tender short rib with brussel sprouts and grilled pear. You could tell real thought went into the menu. The second course included a quarter section of a pumpkin waffle with chicken. I had to save that for the take-out box. But I miraculously found room for the smoked pork belly steak. So fat but so good.   The second time I went there was for the Bacon Board. What a great offer. Unfortunately it's the reason I can't go back there too often, hehe. I truly heart the Bacon Board.   I also love the decor. This is another instance of a restaurant that is too good for its strip-mall location. It's a kind of rustic feel with a lot of wood and metal but they use empty bottles for the light fixture that add a cozy ambiance. This place is conveniently located right by the Shea exit on the 51. I would take visitors here for sure, that is if their cholesterol levels aren't already on the edge. ;)"}
{"text":"Was in the area working all day in needed a place to feed my face before the very last assignment of the day. Just ordered some taco's and not wanted have anything heavy. service was fast and on the spot,no need to be super friendly. Got our food and move on. Will be back if I am in the area again!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service wasn't. Pulled pork sandwich was great, but needed to be served w a side of BBQ sauce which they serve w some of their other meats, but not pulled pork. Sweet potato fries were delicious.  Very unfriendly staff. Wasn't busy when we were here and it was an inconvenience to ask for ketchup."}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem! My only disappointment is that I hadn't found this place sooner. No need going to specifics...everything our party had - from drinks, to appetizers, to our main courses - was delicious.  Service was great, staff was friendly, and the prices are amazing for what you get."}
{"text":"Don't try anything else but the smoked hummus.. It's the best hummus I have ever had... Brisket was a bit dry, the brownie was awful however the hummus made up for it.  Sorry brisket the hummus won this round!!"}
{"text":"We finally tried Bootleggers after hearing about it from a ton of our friends and Neighbors. We will definitely be back. You would never guess that such a great place is hidden in the back corner of a tiny shopping center, but it's there! We had their brisket and prime rib and both were pretty good I would give the brisket five stars and the prime rib four stars.  Bbq was better than the prime rib. the sides were fabulous... we had brocollini and cauliflower mash.   The drink selection was great, the bar also looked like a great place to hang out and either eat and or drink with a few friends and the staff was fabulous. It has a neighborhood feel to it, but is large enough to accommodate a big party. The other things on the menu that looked appealing included salmon and pulled pork, both of which we will try next time we go back.  Overall, solid food but definitely stick with the barbecue as opposed to the prime rib as that's clearly their specialty!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say I like this place but I really don't. Last night was the 2nd time I went there and from what I had remembered from the first time it was terrible service and mediocre food. Last night was no different... We were there on a Monday night at 5pm and there were only about 6 other people there. I know that doesn't matter too much but you think the service would be spot on. We were served by an older guy that stopped buy our table every 15-20 minutes and had so many cheesy jokes it was hard to humor him. I got the beef brisket and it wasn't terrible but there were pieces off meat that were about 90% fat. The potato salad was some crap I could buy in the deli at Frys. Entrees came out at different times so we were all waiting for everyone to have their food. Avoid this rathole."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Was so excited to try after seeing a segment on food network. I was so disappointed one of their signature items was out early in day. Their boot dumplings are suppose to be excellent and sounds amazing.  We had the deviled eggs which are fabulous.  I tried a pork belly taco (my favorite) and macaroni and cheese which was solid and in top I've had before. My husband ordered the French dip and that was excellent with a unique Smokey taste.  Well worth trying all these. Would like to try brisket along with getting those darn boot dumplings!"}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that we really wanted to eat, but were not given the chance........  Also, I worked in the restaurant business for over 17 years, so I know how things should work.  I made an online reservation for 7pm on a Saturday night. We got there 5 or so minutes early. Place was very busy and trendy looking. The hostess said she could not find our reservation and we might have to wait twenty minutes. I asked why there were multiple empty tables if we had to wait twenty minutes and she replied that those tables were for reservations!! She apparently had a change of heart and lead us past many. many empty tables to sit us in a tiny corner.   The tables on our sides were seated 10 minutes or so after us. One server came and took care of a table (seated 10 minutes after us). I tried to get her attention when she finished with them, but she looked right at me and kept going. Another server walked towards us, turned her back and took the order of the other table (she seemed to know them). Again, I tried to get her attention and she walked right by. us.  By now, we had been there over 25 minutes and I was done. As we left, we walked by the hostess stand and she looked right at me, but never said a word. Not a good way to run a business.  With all of these great reviews, I really wanted to try, like this place.It seems like a very trendy, 'Scottsdalish' kind of place. Good luck to them staying open...  There is a new BBQ place called the Hammered Hog that will b opening soon on Cactus and 32 Street. we went and ate at their place after leaving BL and the food was great. Friendlier and great beer prices. And they acted like they wanted us there. More my style."}
{"text":"Get the bacon platter and you won't be disappointed. Seriously ignore the cost and just buy it because the presentation alone is mouthwatering. Five different bacons with different jams to help enhance the taste.   Been to this one and their other loc, both great. PBR is $2 and their cocktails are fantastic. This time with the bacon platter I also got the turkey leg with the oven roasted cauliflower. Very delicious and great atmosphere, this is one of my favorite  places to take my friends out for some great BBQ and drinks."}
{"text":"I only had wings due to not being able to get anything other than coleslaw as an entree side without a big up charge. The wings had good flavor but too much sauce for my taste. Nice size on my martini but nothing to write home about. I won't be back as they can't accommodate any adjustments."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I absolutely love smoked meat and bbq though. We had the Bacon Board which is amazing if you love bacon, the confit is my favorite and the jalpeno is also very good, it even reminded me of being a kid and eating slim jims! I also had the Roosevelt which was quite tasty!  For our meal we had the BBQ Program, everything was super tender and delicious. I found the hot links to be a bit spicy but they were still good. The Turkey was my favorite and the brisket was a close second. For our sides we had the Cottage Fries with Cheese and they were super delicious, really high quality potatoes.  We also had the Mac and Cheese which was delicious and really rich.  The service was great, our server was really friendly and helpful with making recommendations."}
{"text":"A fun barbecue joint tucked into a little strip mall in old Scottsdale. Couples of all ages and friends groups and families enjoyed their dinners with local live music playing  lightly in the back area. 'Cue menu is extensive- we started with beet salad: superior! And their iceberg wedge which he loved. Lucky us-we had Josh who was charmingly conversational without being overly intrusive and very knowledgeable about menu selections. Prime rib was rubbed with tasty smoky flavor-perfect at medium rare and take aways with its goat chews mashed potatoes. His full rack was meat falling off the rib tender and so tasty-also ample for takeaway. Coleslaw was perfectly dressed. Would definitely recommend for 'cue lovers of all ages."}
{"text":"I come here because the cue is awesome (try ribs!) and Larry the bartender makes me feel like family! Rock it Larry!!!"}
{"text":"I'm waffling between 3 and 4 stars. Our server was attentive, we were seated right away and the food was delivered very quickly.  Our party of 4 had the pulled pork: good but could have come with some sauce, brisket sandwich, French dip. The French dip looked really good and the brisket was good but not great. The sandwiches came with chips (not even homemade) Where were the BBQ house fries? A bit disappointing. So would I go again: it's a resounding :maybe. But probably not the first choice."}
{"text":"The Good.   The service. The most hospitable people in AZ.  The beautifully presented pork belly and shrimp dumplings. The guacamole (gotta love a few pepitas and pomegranate seeds thrown in).  The prime rib. Better than good. Smoked for eight hours, this thing is special. Juicy, tender, and everything you want in a meaty dinner.  The pulled pork, the hot links, the back room with the fireplace. All of these makes me feel warm and cozy inside.  The Bad.  The brisket was dried out, and not what you want from a smokehouse. But brisket is hard to do right.   The Ugly.  Me, until you drink enough of their moonshine."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place because he loves the BBQ especially the brisket. The brisket is very good, very tender and tasty and once again he had the brisket when we visited a few nights ago. We also shared the deviled eggs which were on the Happy Hour menu. They must have searched to find the tiniest eggs you've ever seen. The serving size is very small and really too small to share. Three deviled eggs or a total of 1 1/2 eggs but they are delicious probably the best deviled eggs I've ever had. I ordered the beet salad and it is more of a side salad and the quinoa is so negligible that you don't even know it's in there. It was excellent but it could have been larger. The food is good, the portions are small and it's not cheap."}
{"text":"Sadly, another visit to the bar at Bootleggers (Friday night 8/28) where just the bare minimum of service was offered. We got drinks and scanned the menu planning on having some apps. Three people were behind the bar although the one gentleman may have been a bar back. We were talking and waiting for someone to come back and ask if we wanted to order food but we watched them walk by us 5-6 times without stopping to check with us. At this long bar there were only 2-4 other patrons and no one else on our end of the bar. And they weren't rushing around to serve others. Baffling. This is the second time we've stopped expecting a little interaction or at least a chance to order food.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Had dinner the other night. Pulled pork was delicious. The manager, chef and server, Ariel, were very friendly and fun. Ariel was especially nice and a very lovely young lady. TV's in the bar. We sat i the dining room. We'll be back."}
{"text":"First BBQ place we've tried in Phoenix, and we were not disappointed!  Bootleggers is located in a small shopping strip with lots of parking. The restaurant is really well decorated. We had the nachos as an appetizer - awesome! The meat was tender, and the cheese, avocados, and onions just added to the delicious richness. They were a little greasy, but they're nachos - what else am I expecting?  BBQ brisket sandwich was really good. I liked the strong cheese that they paired with the sweet BBQ sauce. The bun was really nice and buttery. Upgraded the potato chips to the fries, which were a little salty, but good. I might forgo the upgrade in the future and stick with the chips.  The brisket plate had a nice, large slab of beef covered in BBQ sauce. The sauce is a little sweet for my taste (I prefer a little more tangy), but the beef was tender and yummy. The accompanying tortillas were surprisingly delicious - super soft, warm, with a wonderful texture and flavor. The coleslaw was pretty good, and I did like that it wasn't weighed down with tons of mayo. Added the green beans, which were cooked perfectly and had a great touch of citrus.  Service was awesome. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back to try a burger and some moonshine."}
{"text":"Brisket was a little salty, but the slaw and asparagus were bomb. Great beer selection, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Must do.  Bacon board.  Moonshine flight (Apple Cinnamon!!!  Imagine apple pie, hot - juicy and flakey, scoop of vanilla, a drizzle of caramel... concentrate... now, pour that drool you are tasting into a mason jar and sip).   Bacon board is plenty for Two, a bite of each for 4.   Good, and known, and, well Bacon is life.  Steak Tartare is fugetaboutit fantastic.   Leon was our magnificent host, server, and entertainment."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great bbq, best I ever had in Arizona our waiter was very attentive the Old Fashion Moonshine cocktail was Excellent , we had the pulled pork nachos Delicious!!!!! We finished off with BBQ sampler for two all I can say is WOW !!! It's full of different flavors yummy all the food was very fresh ,can't wait to go back again ..."}
{"text":"I recommended this place to the family for dinner because I saw it on yelp. We drove up and I was kinda nervous since it was in the corner of a dim lit strip mall. We walked in and it was amazingly beautiful. The ambience was great, and it was so clean. We sat dawn and ordered our drinks and some chow. It all came in a timely fashion. My wife and I got the brisket and mac and cheese, daughter got smoked turkey and my family got a smoked for 2 sampler. We devoured our food. It was so delicious. I was shocked at how good it was. We didn't leave any leftovers. We finished it off with a delicious jack Daniels brownie... I would recommend to anyone looking for good smoked chow!"}
{"text":"The place is very clean and the food very good.  Pricey Though.  $10 for grilled cheese? I will be coming back for happy hour.  I might try the Scottsdale location but am tired of driving over there, so it is nice to have this one in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time with hubby, new baby and our friend from out of town and it was a unanimously amazing experience. Our server Alex was awesome - case in point - when told it was our first time in, he asked us to put the menus down and began a great presentation of all the menu items and what their best known for. We took his advice and got the briscuit, the bootlegger burger, a Sunday special Bloody Mary and the bacon appetizer plate.   All items were 5-star good and the burger was actually fought over. The Bloody Mary was a meal in an of itself as a slider burger came as the garnish. Again, ALEX the host, came through and gave us some of their desert moonshine as samples which led us to order their peach cobbler and chocolate bacon raspberry cake.   After all of this we had to be rolled out of there but not without smiles on our faces and plans to come back next Sunday and the one after that.   Kudos to a new amazing restaurant experience that will certainly be a staple on our dining list."}
{"text":"Definitely a comeback to place. The brisket was very close to spot on. The pulled pork needed a little more seasoning. smoke house mussels were excellent. The cobbler was outstanding also."}
{"text":"Well the service was very good. The patio is perfect for last nights weather. The food was pretty bad. I had the the tri tip with cold slaw and potato salad. The best thing for dinner sadly was the toast and ice water. The tri tip was too over done and fatty. Sorry I can't say anything good about the food. Very nice front line staff working here. Beautiful patio for a nice Phoenix Az evening."}
{"text":"The Best BBQ in Arizona!  Start with the bacon board then tackle the brisket and ribs.  Finish with cobbler.  Chef James Fox is a master at smoking meat, as well as pairing it booze; it is named Bootleggers after all.  Ranging from an apple pie moonshine cocktail to local craft beers, their bar is as well tended to as the smoker.  Bootleggers is a must for any Zoni!  So here's to James, you have thoroughly wet then quenched my hearty thirst for exemplary barbecue!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe and decor, the BBQ smell as you walk in is a bit overwhelming, but the food lives up to it! Nice variety of beers...and the Bootlegger Burger is just crazy good. Seriously one of the best burgers I've had here in Phx . The bacon sprinkled chocolate cake is a must try as well. 32nd and Shea has been a desert wasteland for good food, but thanks to this place and a few other new additions, you can skip McDs and Subway and have something worth eating and returning for."}
{"text":"This might be my first 5 star review. Pork belly is delicious, same with the drinks. To top it off extremely friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Traveling for work from Tampa and had heard great things! Did not  disappoint! The bacon board is a must, and so is the apple pie moonshine!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience in every way. We enjoyed an excellent burger and a pulled pork sandwich. We tried a moonshine flight and believe me it is worth paying a little more for a flight. You essentially get 3 glasses of moonshine with the same amount as you'd get in a regular pour. Their apple pie moonshine is divine. Too easy to drink. Service was excellent and attentive. Food was unbelievably excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"this restaurant is definitely a must try! the interior of the place was super cute, dim, rustic? the staff were very nice and attentive to our needs. we came for their moonshine and bacon board and let me just say that bacon board was AMAZING! it's 5 different kinda of bacon with cheesy bread and two types of jam to complement the bacon. the bacon were all distinctively different and so tender and flavorful. a must try! their house made apple pie moonshine was delicious! I didn't realize the other moonshine a were commercially bought and those were really strong and not too tasty. we also ordered the Mac and cheese and BBQ sampler for 2. the Mac and cheese was pretty delicious, very creamy and had a nice crust on top. the BBQ sampler was pretty good too but we were kinda full from the bacon board. the brisket seemed a bit dry and all the BBQ sauce tasted the same so it got hard to finish, but it does come with tortillas and a delicious coleslaw. the people inside were very chill, not rowdy or overly loud place, I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"What's a quick way to make sure I don't stay for a second beer...be a dick to your co-workers. Bartender is cordial enough...IF he initiates the question. But speak out of turn, or be a waiter looking for a drink order, and he's a douche. Sorry, no other way to put it. I watched him go off on a waiter who was just looking to service his customers. Will never go back here."}
{"text":"Uber delicious - friendly service - great cocktails - killer bacon charcuterie board. We didn't have a full meal here, but I can say without hesitation that we will be back to sample a bit more... and cannot wait!!!"}
{"text":"The bacon board is insane! Do yourselves a favor and get one! The moonshine cocktails are incredible. Beef brisket was divine. The happy hour is great but to truly enjoy the place I would plan on spending about 30 per person."}
{"text":"My son and I came here for the first time tonight and we both really enjoyed it. The burger, sweet potato fries and the smoked brisket basket were excellent. Employees are all very friendly and attentive, relaxing atmosphere tucked back in the corner of a small plaza.  Another great find from Yelp, thank you!!"}
{"text":"We had Dana serve us for dinner... she was very friendly and had great product knowledge. She answered all of our questions and gave recommendations. We thought the food was pretty good... the drinks were great. Beware of the taste/strength ratio in their moonshine or you might end up asking the hostess for her number!"}
{"text":"Smoked Prime Rib is a must. Catch bartenders Larry and John for a great experience. Probably one of the top five in Old Town. Can't wait to try the pulled pork next visit!  Oh....cauliflower steak a unique delicious side dish you must include in your experience!"}
{"text":"The bacon board alone could convince me that love can happen again. And I can't wait to return and get my love on."}
{"text":"Maybe the best pulled pork I have ever had. And a great selection of beer too. And not too hard on the wallet for how quality the experience is."}
{"text":"Our service was amazing.  Must recommend the apple moonshine they have is very good.  The overall location was clean and seemed organized.  Bacon board is a must I also liked the cauliflower with beer onions.  Well my few critics I know BBQ southern boy, and from memphis. My recommendation on pulled pork would be kill the salt amount on the rubs for pulled pork. The overall meal was a tad overall salty to my taste  They where out of the only beer I wanted to try witch was Breckenridge vanilla stout.  The BBQ. Pulled pork had either to much bread or not enough meat also hardly any or light BBq sauce mainly sauced bye the coleslaw mix. I would also recommend maybe adding spices to chips since they where not salty when that should of   Also noticed either gm or owner in girls gone wild tee shirt yellow.. I could be wrong but when someone heads back in kitchen I suppose and I suppose it is scottsdale"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and had the lunch special. Outstanding. We sat outside and smelled the great smoke. It was so darn good, we came back the next night for dinner. Since leaving Scottsdale, all I've been thinking about is returning for more smoked meat. We had brisket, turkey, pulled pork and ribs. All good."}
{"text":"a smokehouse in old town that is affordable ? You damn right. There is no need to break the bank when wanting some ribs or a generous slice of prime rib in a very relaxed environment. This is not a high end place and if you know a true smoke house things can take a little while to prepare. Never order the half rack of ribs though.... take some home and get the full rack , you will be glad you did. The price was fair and service was great."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for new great BBQ restaurants. While walking in old Scottsdale, I came across the enticing aroma of woodfired barbecue. After a short walk, we arrived at Bootleggers. It was shortly after 12 noon and the restaurant was empty. I started off with an appetizer; the guacamole. It was freshly made but was not inspiring. My wife had the pulled pork and I had the brisket entree. The food arrived promptly but we never saw our server again until well after we were done eating. She never checked to see if our food was ok, if we wanted an additional beverage, water, or dessert. Both the brisket and pulled pork were 'ok' but not wonderful by any means and certainly not worth the $53 lunch tab which included a dark beer, a sarsaparilla and dismally poor service."}
{"text":"Okay, LOVE the food, LOVE the restaurant, LOVE the drinks & house moonshine. I had a complaint about lunch time though. It's kinda slow & not busy so there was either a chef or someone smoking right outside on the patio & they had the doors all opened with is cool cause it was a beautiful day but the damn cigarette was absolutely disgusting & like illegal now in Arizona so I don't know why this person felt he could be there he was like 2 feet from the entrance & the wind was blowing right inside so it smelt like I was the one smoking. Nasty. I am pregnant with a child & I was extremely put off & then to boot the person worked there. I just hope management sees this & advises employees of the correct area to smoke &/or everyone just stop smoking, but I'll go with my chances on the 1st request.   But for everyone else; the I get the deviled eggs everytime I go. I don't know what it is but they are freaking fabulous & the giant burger is like. To die for. But I don't eat beef anymore so they have a really amazing chicken sandwich & a bomb kale & salmon salad so there is a nice area of dishes & everything I've had was awesome."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday morning for lunch and there were only a few tables occupied.   Not the easiest place to find, kind of tucked away in a small strip mall in the corner. Good size parking lot. The inside of the restaurant is like a bar.  Came here for one reason and that was for the pork belly sandwich - PBLT. The cut of the each bacon / pork belly is pretty thick in size. Nothing special about the bread lettuce or tomatoes but the pork belly was nice and thick and of course greasy.  Had to try thus once and it was a pretty good sandwich. Reminded me of another place in Chicago that had thick bacon like this.   Can't say I whether I would come back but maybe ti try the bbq"}
{"text":"Not only is the food tremendous but the bartender is extremely expeditious. I was cold at the bar because the fans were on. I asked Chris to turn the off and he did so quickly and with a great attitude. Candidly I was probably being difficult but he went above and beyond to make my experience more enjoyable. Couple that with phenomenal food this place is a no brainer. Deff a local favorite."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations a few times and have yet to be disappointed. Went to the Scottsdale location this evening and as always everything was excellent. Our server Lee was friendly and professional and made it a great experience. The chef Fidy was also incredibly friendly and went out of his way to make sure that we had a great time. I would highly recommend the bacon board but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Again I just want to thank both Lee and Fidy for making it a great dining experience."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I visited here for lunch today and it's always amazing to me that in Phoenix, so many neat places to eat are housed in generic strip malls that you would never know are there. I almost missed the turn off just off the 51 but made it since there are two entrances into their parking lot. Ample parking outside and somehow missed the BBQ smell as I walked up. Upon entering though, you realize this place is way cooler than most strip malls restaurants. The atmosphere was really nice with big booths for larger groups and plenty of tables. The lighting was great and reminded me a lot of the decor that's popping up all over Phoenix at places like Central Bistro and even Olive and Ivy a bit with their cool filament light bulbs.  We were invitied to sit anywhere and we opted for a booth/chairs table along the back wall. The booth was comfy though it was a bit chilly in the place. I need to start remembering to bring a sweater to restaurants during the summer! Everything on the menu sounded really good so we opted for the grilled corn as an appetizer and I ordered the pulled pork with a side of the 50/50 potato salad and my friend ordered the brisket plate and a side of mashed potatoes. Our waitress, while handling what looked like 10 other tables, had perfect timing except for the one time we needed a Diet Coke refill and we had to flag her down. Other than that, she was great, friendly and always had a smile on her face.  Overall I thought the food was pretty good. The corn was a bit disappointing because I'd hoped for more street corn with the creamy sauce drizzled on it but rather got two pieces of corn with some jalepeno spice that made it really hot! I'm a bit of a weeny when it comes to hot so I only ate half but the corn did have good flavor. The pulled pork was really good and I loved their coleslaw. Slightly sweet with not too many ingredients. Also on the plate came with two tortillas. It seemed really strange at a BBQ place and wasn't in the mood but my friend said they tasted like...surprise!...a tortilla. I had expected a slightly more 'deviled egg' potato salad based off the ingredients list so it seemed to lack a little flavor so I probably wouldn't get it again. My friends brisket on the other hand was delicious! Coming from KC, finally there's a place in Phoenix that holds up to some of the BBQ you can get there. The meat was super tender, great sauce and I think she got 4 or 5 slices on her plate.  Overall, love the atmosphere, fantastic service and I'm excited to come back here for more BBQ! I also just realized there was a Local Dines certificate to this place so I'll definitely be coming back more frequently even though its a bit of a drive from downtown."}
