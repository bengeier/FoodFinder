{"text":"Great food, great margaritas, friendly staff, and great service.  The best Mexican joint in the eastern suburbs of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food, drinks, workers etc. 
Their prices are good and especially for the drinks of the day. Atmosphere is fun and welcoming. Sometimes it can get really loud especially a few hours before closing time so if you don't want to deal with that then best bet is to go before 7. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Traveling from IL and searched for dinner - went on reviews for Cocos Locos!!! 
AWESOME FOOD! - staff and we highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. Everything is made from scratch and is #1 in authenticity for Mexican restaurants. We found this when it had just opened(It used to be a Don tequila). The owner is a great guy as well as the entire staff. You are always greeted with a smile and the food never disappoints. Give this restaurant a try, I promise you will never go back anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Willoughby needs to visit Cocos Locos.
Best in Lake County!!!
Stop and you will be pleased!
All fresh ingredients!
Keep them here by trying them....you will not be disappointed!!!
Across from the Hospital in Willoughby.
Enjoy

{"text":"This place is flat out fantastic.  They have the best chimichangas.  Great chips and salsa.  Service is very good."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner and had the Burrito Jose & traditional Fajitas. Sauce was wonderful. It was our first time in, we live in the area and had not been before. Read the reviews before hand and didn't disappoint. We are a little picky when it comes to Mexican food because we like fresh ingredients that aren't mushy. Veggies were cooked perfect, salsa was fresh, and meats were well-seasoned. We known how to order around generic items like refried beans...so we loved what we got. Husband likes the fresh guac, too. Pleasantly surprised to have such a kind, funny, and attentive server in Alex, on superbowl night of all nights. Restaurant was quiet overall and Alex took time to allow us to try a few sauces for burritos to see what we might like!! Very nice of him! We both agreed we'd be back."}
{"text":"Best little Mexican place around. Servers know how to hustle when they get busy which is what helps them maintain consistently delicious dishes at peak hours. My favorite is Steak fajita chimichanga. Take your appetite because portions are pretty large for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened! We love the food and the service! Huge portions for cheap. We always enjoy the fajita chimichanga for lunch and for dinner we get the beef chimichangas, always amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"the food is great and so are the prices. the service is good too. however, I am pretty sure the pop is a knockoff generic brand, even though it is fountain pop. that, believe it or not, kind of ruins it for me. the taste just isn't the same. I don't think it is pepsi or coke, just tastes blah. good food though"}
{"text":"Service is very good!! Food is okay, tastes mild and could be lot better. Not spicy at all!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Cocos Locos and we were so excited after reading the pretty solid reviews. Unfortunately, our dinner just didn't live up to the hype. We got right in, didn't have to wait for a table, which was great. We ordered queso, which never came to us and my husband ordered the \"Taco Tuesday\" special with ground beef. I ordered the arroz con pollo. My dish was ok, but my husband was super disappointed in his. He said that it was basically just ground beef with no seasoning at all. His tacos actually came out incorrectly at first, too. They had to be remade.

Overall, I'd give the food a 2-3, but the service and annoying Mexican techno they were playing really dropped my rating. Won't be going back to Cocos Locos anytime soon."}
{"text":"Thanks to all you YELPERS out there for turning us onto this place!  The last Mexican restaurant here was not too good so we were hesitant about this new place...so as usual we checked out what our fellow Yelpers had to say...and we are in complete agreement!!  
      My husband and I went last Sunday evening and the first thing you notice is how Clean it is!!  Good start!  The salsa is pretty good, but could use a bit flavor.

      My husband had the Fajita chimichanga and I had a regular beef Chimichanga.  We were both really pleased with our meals!  The wait staff is very attentive and we had a great chat with Alex on our way out.  
      They are really working hard there to get and keep customers!  Well they succeeded with us! We will definitely be back!  Oh by the way, my husband said their Margaritas were fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is the old Don Tequila across from the hospital in Willoughby.  What a step up from the old Don's.  Restaurant is clean and the food was very good.  Great service.  Worth a look"}
{"text":"Best mexican restaurant in Lake County. Highly Recommend"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The only thing missing is horchata. 

From the time we entered till we left all of the staff were friendly and smiling. The food came out hot and tasted fresh.

We will we going back. If they add horchata we would go back even more. If you don't know what horchata is be happy you don't know what you're missing."}
{"text":"First visit to this place. We went for lunch on a weekday. 
Service staff was friendly and courteous. Food came out in a jiffy. Server periodically checked on us. Brought out more chips and salsa without us having to ask.
They were going around the tables offering free beans+chorizo side dish. That was a nice gesture. They know about attracting repeat business.
The interior is nice and roomy. Decor was all quite new and well done.
Now the good itself - good. Their salsa was probably the most flavorless that I have had. Tasted more like canned tomatoes than anything else.
But the rest of the food was decent. I had the chicken enchilada combo. Portion was appropriate for lunch. Rice and beans were well seasoned. Chicken inside the enchilada seemed unseasoned and bland. Maybe they can improve upon that.
My buddy had tostada. The way it was served, the sauce from his other item was running underneath the tostada and they topped it with sour cream and lettuce + tomatoes.  There was no crunch left. It was a soggy mess.  But he said it tasted good.
I will go again and try different items. It's one more option for me now."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area and love mexican food. We tried cocos loco and it was amazing!  Everything was delicious and our waiter Alex was great! we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like the restaurant but I think Lisa M took some of my chips when I went to the restroom."}
{"text":"We loved this place.  Cute interior.  Salsa was universally liked by everyone at the table.  Service was quick and friendly.  Fajitas were pretty good...not the best I have had but good.  Sadly, they don't have mole on the menu (that is the first thing I look for on a Mex restaurant menu).  The menu is huge.  Dinner for 3 with tip was $55."}
{"text":"Great Mexican place. Went to dinner here while visiting family over the holidays and the mexican food is excellent. On par with some of the best Mexican places in New York City!

The food is delicious, served hot and with a smile. The restaurant is festive and clean. Loved the intimate and fun booth.

Really enjoyed  the shrimp fajitas and the salsa was flavorful and served with piping hot fresh tortilla chips. Will definitely visit again, next time I am in town. Really recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden willoughby gem!!!  The service was fantastic and the restaurant was extremely clean!!!  

We had guac and quest- both were excellent and the chips were fresh!  The fajita entree was larger than expected and delicious!! 

I took a look at the drink menu and it looks creative and cheap!!  We were certainly be back to Cocos Locos!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. My family and I have been there twice now and once again we were impressed. The service is impeccable from the time you sit down until the time you leave. The chips and fresh salsa are great, actually we purchased some to go. The food comes out sizzling and everything tastes fresh. I would highly recommend this place if you are anywhere close. Beer is good too!!"}
{"text":"We've lived in many towns so we have experienced plenty of Mexican food.  Our first date was at a Mexican restaurant in Richmond, VA.  Y'all know how it is after Thanksgiving.  You don't want to pull out those leftovers, not even one more time!  So we grabbed our group of eight and headed over to Cocos Locos!  (This after an extensive search for a deal on restaurant.com, Groupon, etc. Finally we just went for it.)  The waitress handled our group with ease. Each of us had our little changes with our order and as far as I know, everything was Perfect!  We all have that one uncle, you know the one, who thinks he is God's gift to women and humor.  Our waitress also handled Uncle Wayne quite handily....even after his Grande Margarita.  Fantastic job in a group and when we come as a couple!!!"}
{"text":"So, before a grocery shopping trip, my Wife and I were out and decided stop some place new. We settled on a small, unimposing place called Cocos Locos.

I'm glad we did:) 

Firstly, walking in the door on a Saturday evening, the place was JUMPING, let me tell you. I got the inkling it's a family owned place and may I say, the staff was RUNNING to keep up with customers, and treating everyone really well. We were seated, despite how busy they were, very fast, and presented with a really large menu full of options, both traditional and new.

I got their Cocos Special Salad, which was like eating one of the best fajitas I've ever had (without the carbs, which was a plus for me,) and Patty got a combo platter. Everything was fresh and tasty, well seasoned and well made. 

The people running the place were doing a great job, and from walking in the door, to paying the check, we felt great. Now, it was a bit loud, but that was because of he buzz of families (LOTS of them,) that apparently made up the bulk of their clientele. 

Overall,we really liked the place, and the prices are quite reasonable. 

So, if you want some great Mexican food with a side of good attitude, don't be loco and go anywhere else, stop in at Cocos Locos. :)"}
{"text":"Very nice place for Mexican food. One thing I particularly enjoy here is the salsa and chips. Service is always very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Was much better as last place. food is not so good here and the service matched hope they improve thou soon"}
{"text":"Love this place! Around the corner from work. Quick, delicious and affordable. Great service as always."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after spending way too much time at LW hospital right across the street. My hubby and I were seated promptly. Service was friendly. Food arrived quickly. I ordered the vegetarian special of a cheese quesadilla, bean burrito and potato enchilada. Everything was fresh, hot and tasty.

I wanted to give 5 stars, but there was a few cons involved. No drink prices on the drink menu. Yeah, I should have asked the price of that margarita before ordering it, but I made the mistake of ASSuming it couldn't be that expensive. No way Jose, I was waaay wrong! $10.99 for a chalice of margarita that was bigger than my cat's head and filled with a lot of ice. It was made nice, did the trick, but dang!!!

Also, the tables in that place were very low, so you had to hunch over when eating. And the floor was super slick, like it had just been waxed. I was praying that I didn't fall. Other than those gripes, it was a pleasant experience. I might go back during a happy hour."}
{"text":"Great place!  Ordered the taco salad with ground beef.  Don't let the smaller size fool you, it was more than enough......and delicious!!  So glad our original destination was closed for the day.  Looking forward to returning to Cocos Locos very soon!!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd trip Cocos Locos and this time I brought my co-worker. It was nice & quiet just a few people were in inside,just the way that I like it. Our server was nice & friendly,but he seemed a little down. The service was still great,the was brought out hot & fast. My co-worker ordered the steak quesadilla with rice and she said, hers was very good. Now on to mine,OMG, I ordered burritos Jose,I asked for extra cilantro inside,outside,& all around. It was absolutely,positively, delicious. I'm still smiling because it's so big that I was able to bring half of it hm. Burritos Jose is packed with shrimp,steak,chicken,rice,black beans(my favorite), cilantro,& a few other goodies. It's also smothered in a delicious cream sauce. I can hardly wait until lunch tomorrow when I warm up the leftovers."}
{"text":"Great taste at great price. Nice environment, very Mexican. Like the tortillas and salsa"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Cocos Locos, there are so many choices for mexican food in the immediate area, I've been slowly working through the list.  Cocos Locos didn't disappoint.  I visited on Friday evening at approximately 8:00, full house, lots of families.  The place is clean and the staff is welcoming.  I was seated immediately.  I ordered a margarita on the rocks, sugar rim, cheap ($5) and tasty!  I also received a huge basket of tortilla chips and tasty salsa.  I ordered the shrimp fajita quesadilla, which arrived a short time later with a side of seasoned rice, guacamole dip/sour cream in an edible flour tortilla bowl.  The quesadilla, was huge, lots of shrimp and grilled veggies nestled in a cheese sauce in a perfectly grilled tortilla.  My total bill was less than $20 and was worth every penny.  I will return."}
{"text":"We read the reviews and went there yesterday for lunch. We were so pleasantly surprised by our experience we can't wait to go back. The food was delicious and the prices were perfect. The chicken in my enchilada dish was white meat, not dry, not greasy, tasted amazing, and fresh!
The ground beef in my soft taco was spiced perfectly and tasted better than any local Mexican restaurant I have been to.

It is under new management and they have completely remodeled, it is very inviting and clean. So forget any experience you had with the previous owners(Don Tequilas).It really is a new place they didn't just move in and keep the old, they gutted it.

We talked to the new owner, José who was an extremely nice guy and very customer focused. He told us about the quality meat they use, its fresh and you can taste the difference. He told us he uses lower fat meat and fresh meat, which is why it was not greasy like other places. 

The salsa was made fresh and tasted great and the guac was good too.

I rarely write reviews but definitely want this place to make it. 

The other members of my party also had great meals. We were floored with how good it was. Usually one would have certain notions of what a Mexican restaurant will taste like but these guys go above and beyond. 

The wait staff was also extremely friendly and attentive.

If you want good Mexican food this is the place to go to in the area, you won't be sorry.

The desserts are even good and made fresh."}
{"text":"Under new management.  Food was very good and our waiter was absolutely the best.  Very attentive.  Will definitely return.  Had the California burrito, will order it again.  The chips were warm and the salsa was excellent."}
{"text":"Dined here for first time tonight and was really impressed. Cheerful friendly staff made sure drinks, chips and salsa were quickly replenished. Two of us chose the Lupe burrito (chicken, chorizo, beans, guacamole, onions, etc..) chicken was super tender and chorizo very tasty. These burritos were so huge that we didnt mind that they did not come with any sides. We also ordered custom corn tacos with rice, beans, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. Also very good. For desert we tried the chimi cheesecake which was out of this world! We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food ever! I had the Camarenos Diablo and though a little intense on the sauce, it was an amazing shrimp dish that I highly highly recommend. The ambience, service and food is highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far. Food is piping hot and delicious. It arrived quickly.  I can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised!  Service was fast and friendly. The food was delicious and I will be back again.  Raphael was our server.  He was so nice!  Consider me a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"All I can say is...SWEET BABY JESUS!!!! This is the best mexican food I've had in a long time! The food was so good I couldn't wait to take the foodie pic."}
{"text":"Great food at unbeatable prices. The staff is very friendly and it's such a nice place to eat. Be sure to bring your Belly card or install the app on your phone and check in!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. The staff is delightful and friendly, the food is amazing and arrives quickly- what more could you ask for? I know this shouldn't matter but the restrooms are always spotless. I recommend the shredded beef enchiladas. I always have enough to eat for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"The Cocos Salad is amazing! I came for lunch and the service is super quick!

The really enjoy spicy food and the chipotle chicken was seasoned with just the right amount of spice and the dish also contained pineapples that complimented the spice really well. The grilled peppers, onions, pineapples and chicken made for the perfect lunch salad. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Taco Tuesday (5 tacos for $5).  Was the first person to arrive for lunch, but a few more tables showed up by the time I was leaving.  I was promptly seated, received chips and salsa, and placed an order.  Food came out very quickly (less than 5 minutes) and was solid.  I forgot to even think about ordering soft tacos - wish the waiter would've asked (minor complaint).  One nice touch...when I had finished my drink, the hostess noticed and flagged down my waiter to bring a refill.  Clearly, this place cared about my dining experience, which isn't always the case nowadays."}
{"text":"Worst fried ice cream EVER. Guacamole was very bland. Would not go there again if I lived here. Flavors are bland."}
{"text":"If you love Mexican food, then go for it!! Best Mexican restaurant in Willoughby area. Excellent service and a ton of options to choose from. Tried the pollo con crema, quesadilla fajita supreme - both of them were delicious. Complementary salsa was mouth watering too!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. The place looks great and is very clean. The staff was cheerful and friendly. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Starting off with my comparison to my favorite Mexican restaurant, Fiesta Jalapenos. Unfortunately, this place just didn't do it for me. 

Small portions, fruit flies buzzing around, terrible (stressed) service. This honestly looks like a struggling business. Although I don't know how many Mexican restaurants are in this area. 

Sorry Cocos Locos, I'll be heading back to the west side for Mexican."}
{"text":"The service was fast, the food was very tasty and filling. Clean and the staff was personable. My kinda place"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was fantastic!  I got the chicken burrito and quesadilla. Burrito was delicious and I got rice, beans and tortilla chips included. Great menu to choose from!  Service was great. As far as authentic home cooked Mexican nothing in the area even comes close. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So most of you already know that my reviews are brutally honest and it's time for another one. 

 I LOVE this place!!! Finally, I have found a Mexican resturant that I am in love with. I love the lighting and but wait, Coco Locos... Do you know how many times I have driving by this place on my way to Target? And I'm like EW, Cocc Locos? But then my mother took me to this place and said, \"Okay, we are going to go to this place called Coco Locos and please don't destroy them in your reveiw, I love this place.\" \"Well, it better be on point then\", was my responce and it was!!! So I got the Calfornia Burrito which is my new fav with a spicy sauce (which doesn't come with it by the way, it's from the fire burrito). Its basically a burrito with a grilled tortilla stuffed with chicken or steak, tomatoes, onions and peppers. My mom had a burrito but I forgot what kind she had (oops) and the second time went, my boyfriend had the same kind as me and he loved it as well and he is very hard to please. He said, that the burrito took him to some Mexican little boy's childhood . Our waiter (a young male) was awesome, he was very out spoken but friendly. I really liked him and although he forgot a thing or two he was very attentive. **Did you know that a Burrito is not Mexican but rather Tex-Mex? I had no idea until he told us. So, Friendly, informative, attentive, outspoken and awesome 5 stars. 

OMG!!! I almost forgot, The Margaritas are amazing!!!!! DO NOT CHANGE THE WAY YOU MAKE THEM!!!! If you are going to order Watermelon, or raspberry margritas, your going to be slightly dissapointed. They taste nothing of the sort but they sure are nice and strong and they taste good. A Medium should do you just fine or a Grande but I wouldn't go bigger then that unless you want to be there for a while. 

Also the desserts, would have earned them 4 stars but they make up in food and drinks for what they lack in dessert."}
{"text":"Friendly service large portions and ample Margaritas.  Steak in my grilled steak fajita was a little chewy."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly atmosphere, amazing food! The shredded beef chimichanga is expertly seasoned/balanced and the frozen margaritas have a nice kick!"}
{"text":"I used to go here so often that the staff would know my order when I walked in,now after it closed and re-opened with different staff,different menu and everything 2-3$ more for less food then you would before I avoid this place as much as possible. With plenty of other Mexican options around,I'd suggest go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great place! The east side is full of pretty good Mexican places so I am always looking for what makes a place stand out, enter the chimi fajita. Fresh veggies, grilled chicken wrapped in a shell (fried if you want) sizzling on a hot plate. Add to that a 2nd plate full of authentic style rice and beans, tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream!  

The only negative stars is due to the chips. Those don't taste like they were made on site, but they make up for it with the salsa and guacamole! 

We went with a big group and the service was also top notch! Great place, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was in Ohio and went to this restaurant.  I really liked the decor and the place was clean. They have great chips and salsa and the food was delicious and full of flavor.  On top of that, the service was fantastic and the staff was friendly. I will be back on my next business trip!"}
{"text":"Attention all sour cream lovers, If you ask extra they really hook you up. Also service was great margaritas good. They have lots of deals. So great!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite stops! The food is fresh and delicious and the service is great and great drink specials and prices! If you are in the mood for Mexican or a good margarita with fresh juice stop here!"}
{"text":"After moving here from Florida my husband were looking for GREAT Mexican food. We finally found it here at Cocos Locos. The flavor of their Guadalajara style dishes is delicious and authentic. The speed of service is great and staff made us feel like we were amigos! This is our go to Mexican restaurant. You have to try this place! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I had the taco combo (steak and chorizo) with an appetizer of cheese sauce."}
{"text":"We were out of town visiting and tried this based on reviews.  The service was very fast and the margaritas were not shy of tequila.  My combination chicken taco was moist and flavorful, which you don't often get in chicken tacos, so I was pleased.  My cheese enchilada has a nice amount of cheese and the enchilada sauce has a spicy flavor that was a great compliment.  My companion chose a pork burrito which again was well season and moist, not dried out, as some can be.  The guacamole appetizer was very good and freshly prepared.  You could taste the lime and cilantro, which we happen to enjoy.  The chips were sturdy enough to hold the chunks of avocado.  We would definitely return if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Not the same with new owners. Not as friendly atmosphere as before. Texas Margarita is weak and bland. Price went up. Sour cream is additional cost on dish. We went few times but didn't have the taste and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food!  I was expecting the same old, same old but this is much better than that.  Lots of the traditional Mexican fare on the menu but a few things you don't see anywhere else.  I had the taquitos and my nephew had the fajitas and both were very good.  Everything was fresh and well prepared.  I will certainly be back!  I'd like to go back after work to try the margaritas!  Staff was very friendly and attentive, too."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after a recommendation from a friend. My boyfriend & I went for dinner on a Thursday. They have good happy hour deals, including good margaritas! I ordered vegetable fajitas - hearty portions, flavorful & delicious. My bf ordered a chicken burrito & enjoyed it. We also ordered their guacamole- yum! Overall, great service & good food. It's been tough finding authentic Mexican food in this area, so now we have a place to go!"}
{"text":"Food was very bland no taste at all toppings for tacos were extra go figure. If I'm ordering a taco I would expect all the taco fixings. All in all nothing was flavorful"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite Mexican restaurant EVER! They are always very friendly and make the best recommendations! It's just an all around great environment with the absolute BEST homemade sangrias I have ever had. Very affordable and great portions of food! Love this place!"}
{"text":"On another business trip, and stopped in here for some food.  Very authentic, I think.  The margarita was pretty good (I had enough beer for the night).  I got the enchiladas where you get 1 of each of 5 different ones.  By far, the best beef enchilada that I think I have ever had.  The rest were ok...but that beef.  Service was on point and friendly.  Prices were extremely reasonable, and the company was paying - Damn!  The salsa had a different flavor.  I tasted a lot of cilantro.  Not a huge fan."}
{"text":"Good food.  Lots of choices on the menu.  Any they have queso which isn't too common with Mexican places in the north.  Yum..."}
{"text":"Omg this was a great find.  I will recommend this place to all. The food is made to order so if you want no onions (me) then it is no biggie. The ingredients were fresh and seasoned perfect.  I wish there was six stars because then I could wine about there not being seven stars.  Come but make sure you have your appetite!!!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment..... Thought this would be awesome Mexican food and it was average at best.    The best part of the meal was the salsa.   It had tons of cilantro (just how I like it).    I got nachos and the meat lacked flavor l, my husband complained about his burrito being the same way.    The margaritas were ok.    Service was slow considering there was only 4 tables there.    I feel like I can find better, which is why I haven't gone back."}
{"text":"Great as usual. Fast and polite service. Would definitely recommend. Food was yummy as always. Love the chicken with chorizo, not sure what it's called. So much food that I always take some home."}
{"text":"Cocos USED to be my favorite. idk what happened. They switched to a fancier looking plating but the quality of food isnt the same as it once was. Also portions seem much smaller than they once were"}
{"text":"Excellent meal, great service!  You can tell that everything is made from scratch. The salsa is superb, and the guac is mind blowing. I ordered the Camarones a La Diabla, and it was delicious.  I highly recommend this place; best that I've had in this area. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered for take out and was pleased with the service when I picked up.  Veggie fajitas were amazing, however I would suggest giving a few more tortilla shells, as the amount of veggies was massive.  They also sent us home with a bag of chips and salsa, which appeared to have a cost associated with them but was not charged.  Will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The servers are so friendly and they make you feel like your a part of their family. Always smiling and never rushed.

The margarita's are really the best around and they don't skimp on the tequila. 

From the fajita's to the burritos, the food is always fresh and very flavorful.  We have had several dishes and all of the are very good.  They have a variety of sauces and spices that make their food stand out over other Mexican food in the area.  The salsa is another stand out item over others in the area.  It is VERY fresh and has great flavor with just the right amount of heat.  

We are big fans of chorizo and they have the best I have ever had anywhere!  They make it in house and besides being fresh and delicious, again with spices that make it stand out, it is not greasy.  It is simply wonderful."}
{"text":"We stopped on our way home from Niagara Falls and was hoping to get in and out quickly.  Not a problem........and food was AMAMZING!! Service was quick and great!"}
{"text":"Reviews for this restaurant did not disappoint. Fast service, lots of booths, and delicious food with large portions. We got a large guacamole and queso dip, both were good and they gave us a lot of guacamole! We shared a few dishes - carnitas, shrimp with garlic cream sauce, and cocos salad. All were yummy but I especially liked the first two. As a heads up, the salad was essentially grilled chicken and veggies over lettuce, good but not a traditional salad. Really enjoyed this restaurant - a hole in the wall with fresh and delicious food."}
