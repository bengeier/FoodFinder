{"text":"I should have known when I pulled into the parking lot to get my takeout order. The lot was packed and this place was empty at 8 on a Saturday. The food was absolutely horrible. We got the large Sicilian with pepperoni. The dough was so undercooked it was raw and gummy. There were three little pepperoni slices stacked on top of each other on each large piece leading to almost no pepperoni in every bite. The garlic knots were dry and the tomato dipping sauce was extremely bland. When we called to complain we were told that this is how this is supposed to be. As I left the restaurant I noticed that the lot was packed because of Emporio on the other end of the building. I suggest giving them a shot over Mamma Lucia. Or even go into Market District to get ingredients to make a pie that won't get you sick."}
{"text":"Good pizza messed up our order and then made it right and apologize and gave us a gift card"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, have never been able to try their food because every time our office tries to order, they NEVER have a delivery driver. Apparently, a guy that \"doesn't show up\". I don't know about anyone else, but if I just chose to not show up to my job, I would get fired!!! Maybe they should hire someone else?!? My first impression of them is not very good so far..."}
{"text":"The staff was rude. The food made me and my wife sick for 2 days. It was greasy and not very good. I would not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't order the eggplant, my date did. I tried it tho & OMG AMAZING...I never order eggplant, but I'll go back just to get that dish again. SO good!! & I've tasted the eggplant in most of the top Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, trust me, you won't be disappointed in the eggplant!"}
