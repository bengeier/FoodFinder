{"text":"Great neighborhood joint for ribs. The ribs are tender and smoky. The hot sauce is actually quite spicy but delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Pittsburgh for ribs! The smoky flavor and especially the barbecue sauce are what makes me return time and time again!"}
{"text":"Wilson's sauce has to be the hottest in in Pittsburgh, the land of weaksauce. Half a chicken under $6 bucks, rack of ribs not much more.  I love this place except for the two pieces of bread in a bag, it reminds me of prison, but still five stars."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  My husband loves their ribs and I love their chicken.  It is so close and convient to get to.  Favorite place to go for the smokey flavor."}
{"text":"My experience at Wilsons was very unpleasant. The first thing I noticed was how dirty everything was. The walls, the floor, the screen on the door... The whole place needed a good scrubbing, and the impression was that it last received one in the 1960's. The salads all looked day old so I passed on them, and the ribs I got were apparently leftover as well from who knows when, as they were dry and tough as shoe leather. Thanks but no thanks, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I almost turned around and left after going in here this afternoon, but I was too hungry to walk away from the amazing smell that surrounds this place for about three blocks. Ok so glad I didn't let the total lack of ambiance or AC turn me off! The people are great and the BBQ and macaroni salad are the best I've ever had. I didn't even know I could eat a half a chicken, but I sure did today! If if been alone, I'm pretty sure I'd have licked the plate, too. This place is amazing. Make sure you have cash on hand!"}
{"text":"As soon as you open the door, the smoky aroma of ribs cooking greets you!  The ribs were delish but not as crazy about the sides.  I usually love collard greens and cole slaw with my ribs but the greens were too salty and the cole slaw was nothing special.  Also missing corn bread!  But the ribs are among the best in the Burgh. Only did take out...small place for any large group."}
{"text":"One of the best hole in the wall bbq places you might find. Prices are pretty reasonable. Bring Cash. Small plate for $7something will get you about 5 huge ribs. It comes with bread too. A large plate is 10 and it is probably huge.  They tend to be packed on the weekend but its a god place to get it and go. warning- you might get messy. The collard greens are amazing as well. They have sweet potatoe pie from time to time... if you are going to the Mattress Factory - make this your after stop!"}
{"text":"Good bbq. I wish they would charge a tad more and build a better place and get more menu items, but for what it is it's great. I have always left happy and full."}
{"text":"Don't do it!   The ribs are average at best. The sides are just as average as well. The bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all. The greens were decent and the macaroni salad was awful with tons of water in it.   This place is almost as bad as the now closed Mr Willie's BBQ in Squirrel Hill! I had such high hopes for this place. Oh well. That's what I get for trying to cheat on Showcase BBQ in Homewood. Now those are the best ribs in Pittsburgh and some of the best in the country!   They don't take debit or credit cards. Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Ribs were so fresh and fool of smoke loved it. Sauce is home made got the mixed had just the rite bite to it."}
{"text":"I was on a photo shoot with my friend when I caught a whiff of the smoky, welcoming aroma emitting from across the block. I walked over to find this hidden gem.  By far, this is the best barbecue I've had in Pittsburgh. I got half a rack of ribs with their barbecue hot sauce along with some collard greens. The flavor was smoky and the meat was tender. The service was also in credit homely and welcoming.  TLDR: best barbecue ribs in Pittsburgh coming from a local mom and pop shop. Will be coming again."}
{"text":"I get it. But atmosphere doesn't matter in my review of this. Food was hot. The prices are very fair. The menu could be a couple items longer though. No greens when I visited either. The man serving wasn't friendly. Which isn't about to hurt my feelings. The rib meat carried a great smoke flavor. And the sauces were tasty. But it was far from \"fall off the bone\" type tender. Really had to work at it.   Edit- been by thrice more. The ribs were far better. Just a weird batch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for take-out in Pittsburgh.  The ribs are cooked Southern style, and just the way I love them.  This is extremely satisfying slow cooked wood fire BBQ.  You have to get there early in the evening to get the chicken.  The service is quirky, but I find it charming.  The decor is \"down home.\"  The hot sauce is hotter than you might expect...so I recommend you ask for a mix, or just go for the mild.  Let's just say I every so often get a craving for Wilson's BBQ, and it's always a special treat."}
{"text":"I stopped by yesterday at around 5:30 with CM to grab some dinner after spending the afternoon at the Aviary.  I'd wanted to try Wilson's last weekend before a visit to the Mattress Factory, but wasn't able to because we lacked cash, and Wilson's is a cash only establishment.  This time, we came prepared with plenty of green, so we were able to get our BBQ bliss on.  In case you don't notice the heady odor of smoked meat when approaching Wilson's, it literally hits you in the face as soon as you walk in.  I first inquired about the chicken, but was told by the gentleman working behind the counter (presumably Mr. Wilson) that they were out of it for the day.  Thus, CM and I decided to split a large plate of ribs (around $12), which comes with 6 bones.  Because we'd heard that Wilson's hot sauce is seriously hot, we ordered a mix of hot and mild sauce for the ribs.  For sides, we decided to order the collard greens and the potato salad ($1.34 each), and I got a can of iced tea, as well ($1).  Because he's still having some trouble breathing from his ongoing cold, CM requested that we get our items to go, so I obliged.  After finding a picnic table in West Park commons with a little help from a local resident, we unpacked the food and dug in.  We first tried the ribs, and found them appropriately smoky and the right texture, with sufficient give but not falling apart.  The sauce was just the right level of spiciness to satisfy both of us, as well--spicy enough to provide a nice kick, but not so spicy as to be overwhelming.  After finishing the ribs, we both used the slices of white bread provided to soak up the remaining sauce.  As for the sides, they were clearly homemade and of good quality and flavor, though the potato salad was a bit mushier than I'm accustomed to, and the collards were a bit saltier than I'd like.  Overall, we were quite pleased with the quality and amount of food that we received for the price that we paid (around $16).  Make no mistake: Wilson's is a hole in the wall, but in the best sense of the phrase--check it out for solid, unpretentious BBQ that hits the spot for a casual picnic lunch or dinner if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"We love the ribs here.  Watch out, the spicy sauce is really spicy.  The location is nice to grab something for a tailgate party.  Never disappointed, although the place looks like a dive, it's actually really really good.  I wish they still made pulled pork sandwiches, maybe someday..."}
{"text":"I can smell great aromas every day when I pass this place! Finally decided to stop in to see what it is all about. I ordered a small plate with mild sauce and took it home to eat. I was extremely impressed! The place definitely looks like a hole in the wall but they put all of the effort into their food. Definitely will stop in to get more ribs sometime!"}
{"text":"The ribs here are addictive.  My boyfriend and I got stuck in a post-game traffic trying to leave the area after ordering from there and ate half the ribs right there in the car--best traffic experience ever.  For $20 it's a lot of ribs and I dream of going back there..."}
{"text":"The ribs were great with mild sauce.  The chicken with hot sauce was ok.  Hot sauce was nice and hot,  but not the greatest flavor.  Mild sauce was delicious.  Slaw wasn't very good.  Mac salad was good.  Collard greens... Well,  not for me...   Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is a great local rib spot. The ribs are delicious and I was a big fan of the coleslaw. I mixed the hot and mild sauce for the ribs and it was plenty spicy for me, letting you taste the flavor while giving it enough kick. It's cash only, so keep that in mind and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is an unassuming place on the North Side - close to the Mattress Factory. But walking in the door, you are hit with a wall of smokiness (the rib kind), and you know this is a serious place. The owner, Mr Wilson, is a quiet man of few words. You have 2 choices - ribs or chicken. Ribs come in small plate, large plate, or full rack. Then you can add on sides and soda at about $1 each.   I went with a small group, and we filled ourselves silly on ribs and sides.  Very good sauces. The small plate of ribs is *very* filling for lunch.   As others have said, the decor is nothing to write home about. But there are a few tables. Most of the business when we were there was take-out, which I will definitely be returning to do."}
{"text":"Absolutely live this place. My favorite bbq in the city. I always make sure to get a whole rack and extra sauce to put on things throughout the week. Take out only and make sure to get in early before they run out"}
{"text":"This place looks like it wouldn't serve good food but you best believe this old style barbecue is UNREAL. The way they cook their meat to be fall off the bone tender is just unbelievable. The wood ovens give their food so much more flavor than just a gas smoker. By far best barbecue on the north side or in the city for that matter"}
{"text":"Stopped by after visiting the Mattress Factory since it is nearby.  Wilson's hasn't change in years, it has been many years since my last visit.  The same old crusty BBQ joint.  The staff is friendly.  We got a half rack of ribs.  The ribs were tender, smokey and covered in sauce.  Probably a tad to much sauce.  Not a big fan of the sauce seems to be a lot of pepper and not much else."}
{"text":"Just plain awesome! We read some reviews before trying and people basically love the ribs. Some complained about the guy behind the counter being surly and that it is a hole in the wall. Well, we expected a \"Soup Nazi\" experience and the main problem was that their television echoes through the place while the soft-spoken guy, positioned about 30 feet away at the oven, asks what you want with soft-spoken voice. I felt badly saying \"What?\" so many times but finally got the order straight. He was very patient with us.  After tasting the magnificent ribs, we told him that these were the best ribs we'd ever tasted (also over the dratted television noise). The guy was positively beaming and we had a nice conversation with him. He said the recipe has been in the family for 140 years so far. He also said that the style was Louisiana BBQ. I had mild and my brother-in-law had hot. We were both extremely satisfied. There was plenty of meat on the ribs and they were done to perfection. They did not have cole slaw but we did try potato salad--very good too!  The ambiance is nothing to write home about, but it seemed good enough. But the ribs are so good that I very much look forward to, actually LONG to, go back again. I crave the ribs and it's only been 4 days since I was there for the first time."}
{"text":"A brick wood-fired smoker with a cast iron door, a stainless steel prep table with cutting boards, cooler case, a cash register, and a man who has been tending the coals well beyond your time.  Wilson's is what a great BBQ place should be.  Simple.   There is no sense in overanalyzing what Mr. Wilson has been doing here for years.  He's not a competition circuit smoker, not a modern restaurateur spreading his seed across Pittsburgh, and certainly no hipster chef serving ingredients grown in his rooftop garden.  Ribs. Chicken. Sauce.  The slow smoked spare ribs, sold by the plate size or full rack, are smoked just long enough to make the rib bones protrude from the top of the slab but not long enough so the meat is \"falling off the bone\"... tender and juicy, but enough bite to let you know that you're eating the flesh off an animal.  The color and texture of the surface aren't overwhelming in flavor but give you just enough crust and seasoning to let you experience the strata of bark / meat / fat.  For those that don't like fat, you'll complain about the ribs.  Spares have a tendency to hold a bit more fat within the meat fibers, particularly the section around the tips that are usually trimmed for a St. Louis cut.  you want low fat? Eat a pork loin or a handful of grass.  The chickens are halved and smoked right alongside the ribs. The skin had nice chew, a good simple rub, and cooked beyond the point of any gummy texture but not so long that it was a layer of armor surrounding the meat.  The dark meat was succulent and the white meat maintained just the right amount of moisture.  As requested, everything was served with the hot BBQ sauce.  Not mind blowingly hot, but a well rounded picquant flavor with a bit of black pepper on the tip of the tongue.  Tomato base with a bit of vinegar, good enough to compliment the meat and fat of both animals.  As for sides, the collard greens are tender and you'll come across the occasional gold nugget of pork.  The coleslaw and macaroni salad are simple and a bit underseasoned, but when eaten in tandem with the meat and sauce they compliment everything just fine.  Mr. Wilson also caps off an order with the true stamp of great bbq... white bread. A vessel to mop up all the rib shrapnel swimming in the pool of sauce at the bottom of your styrofoam container.  It's not the cleanest, it's not the classiest... why?  It's a rib shack in an old house that's been here for going on 53 years.  It may not be the best barbecue you'll ever eat, but in a city with new restaurants popping up every week that all try to outduel each other with trendy ingredients, it's nice to know that I can walk in through an old screen door and be slapped in the face with a stiff breeze of smoking pork... without having to worry about anyone selling me small portion size, extravagant presentation, and a list of 35 ingredients to compose a single dish."}
{"text":"I have grown up on Wilson's ribs and chicken and have always loved it. Today I stopped by and was not disappointed. The hot sauce is exactly how I've remembered it. The ribs fell off the bone. The potato salad is amazing, and I tried the greens for the 1st time and it was just as good. It may sound like I'm over hyping Wilsons but, it follows through with how great it is. The service was also extremely friendly too. I can't wait to go back :-) best bbq in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great experience. Small menu, but what he does, he has mastered. Ribs were NOT overcooked like most places in Pittsburgh. The chicken was phenomenal and you gotta get them greens..... Smokey goodness. I will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Don't risk it. Never open when you need it, unreliable availability with his products. He offered to reserve some for me until it was done cooking and then when I returned on time he had already sold it. I was excited to try it for the first time but won't waste my effort in the future if this is how customer service is handled. There are other BBQ places that actually have food to serve."}
