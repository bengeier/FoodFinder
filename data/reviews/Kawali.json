{"text":"Best Filipino food. Lovely staff. All the little things I was hoping for, from sizzling Sisig to Ube cookies, warm and soft in the middle. So good. I'm dreaming of my next visit."}
{"text":"I'm really lucky to have happened upon this restaurant. Since my copain is Filipino I let him pick which dishes we would have. He chose the cripsy pata, which is a whole pig's foot deliciously fried so that the skin was still juicy but crispy. I'm sure you can't eat this all too often, but it was absolutely fantastic....it reminded me a lot of the Chinese roast suckling pig. Then we also had adobong sitaw (adobo long beans) which was our vegetable choice and I found it to be the perfect compliment to cut through the fattiness of the pork. I didn't have much of the beef dish we got but it had a stew like consistency and was also very good. Overall, I felt like someone's family cooked a special meal for me and it's obvious that they take great care in everything they make."}
{"text":"Food is a ok  and they always forget or they don't have the sauce for the pork and that food can't stand alone without it's sauce"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Filipino food in Montreal, this is the place! Sisig, lechon kawali, crispy pata, and lumpiang shanghai are what I usually order. The food is affordable and leaves you satisfied. I've taken non-filipino friends here to introduce them to Filipino cuisine, and they have only shared positive comments."}
{"text":"Great friendly restaurant for Filipino style food - breakfast/brunch, hot food and baked goods. Must try their freshly baked Ensaymada!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Montreal and, being Filipino, I'm touring the town for good Filipino restaurants. I had a pakbet and ginisang mongo combo. The mongo had such a funny taste I think it was going bad in a matter of one hour. While still edible, it shouldn't have been served.   This place is just like most Filipino restaurants: they serve tiny portions measured in cups or bowls. No Filipino consumes that tiny amount. So you finish your meal and you're left wanting. I think the combo is worth closer to $8, not the $10 they charge.  My search continues."}
