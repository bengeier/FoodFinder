{"text":"Went here for a birthday and I did like that it wasen't packed at all for 10 at night, and the pool was free, but they re guiness beer was horrable. It tasted like an old fountain drink, syrupie, and flat. It took me so long to drink one pint and I ended up giving the rest of it away to others in my group who were not to fussy as long as it was alchole. They re ceasers ( drink ) was pretty good but a little too much ice, and they re rolling rock was nice. A little pricey, 2 pitchers, a rum, 1 ceaser, and pizza came to 75 bucks with the tip. It was nothing to rave about but id proably still go back even though I gave it 2 stars. Just never have the guiness, and have the pizza, and other food because it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Late January 2013, my wife and a girlfriend went to Joey Bravo's for a girls night out. She brought some of it home, it was really good. I was impressed at how fresh the vegetables were, especially how crisp the green beans were the next day. 

My wife and I attended late February 2013 for our 4th wedding anniversary. It was a slow night for Joey Bravo's due to the weather, which made it more intimate for us. We sat by the firepalce, the ambience was very nice. Our waitress had a very pleasant demeanor and was very helpful. For my appetizer, I had seafood soup because they were out of clam chowder, my entr√©e was Chicken Oregano, in white wine sauce, served with sauteed vegetables. I wanted to have pasta as my side, I chose, Linguine. My wife had Chicken Marsala in a marsala wine mushroom sauce, served with sauteed vegetables in garlic olive oil sauce. Our entire meal was excellent! The seafood soup was very flavorful, the pepper that the waitress added gave it the right amount of spice. The chicken was very tender and had lots of flavor. The vegetables were cooked to perfection as were the broccoli and cauliflower which were nice and crisp. For desert, I had Tira Misu and my wife, creme caramel. It was tasty and not too sweet.

For the purpose of context, the following is what I consider to be excellent food:

Centro's in Toronto: The sea bass is excellent.
Sandals Grand Resort in St. Lucia: From pub to elegant dining, everything was exceptionally good.

Finding very good restaurants in Toronto is unfortuntely rare. We are looking forward to our next dinning experience at Joey Brovo's Ristorante!

I would have easly given Joey Bravo's 5 stars but the way Yelp's site is worded is cheesy, \"Woohoo! As good as it gets. \"

I hope my review is helpful.

God bless,

{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 3.5.  The pasta here is surprisingly decent and better than any of the chain restaurants that serve pasta.  The pasta has never been soggy for me and sauce is just to my liking.  Granted it's not the best place for pasta, but not bad for a Scarborough joint.  Please note, I have only enjoyed the pasta there. The soup, salad and dessert is below average by my standards and I am not sure about the other dishes."}
{"text":"Nice gem in Scarborough! Quite good Italian fare in a family-friendly setting."}
{"text":"Came here recently. Would give this place 3.5 stars, but it gets a bonus .5 for being pretty much the only place in Scarborough that has good pasta/pizzas. It's good when you don't want to drive all the way to Shiso Leaf Cafe for a good pasta or something!

This place looks quite old, and it definitely is. It's been around ever since I've been in the neighbourhood, and that is a very long time!

Try their Paesana. I've had a quite a few of their pizzas and I always enjoy them, though I think one of my favorites was the Luigi. They're thin crust and loaded with ingredients!"}
{"text":"Came here two years ago for Winterlicious.

We didn't have a reservation ahead of time so this is all we were able to get. I remember the main course was cold and non-creative. Best thing was the salad. Not very good quality food, and I felt that the overall environment was not very upbeat. 

will not visit again."}
{"text":"Post-dating back to Summerlicious '10, Joey Bravo is a small Italian restaurant situated in the Scarborough area. Walking into this restaurant gives off a rustic feeling, with a central fireplace in the middle of the restaurant, wooden chairs and tables, and wooden panels all around. It certainly gave a more family-friendly environment, over a romantic one. There is also a nice patio outside when spring/summer comes around and a bar/pool table for game nights.

The restaurant itself was empty when our group of 12 came in, but we had no prior expectations as to how our night was going to end up. We had the choice of ordering al la carte or sticking with their Summerlicious prix-fixe menu. I opted to stick with the prix-fixe menu, hoping it was Joey Bravo's tried and true staple items.

Ordered:
Pan Fried calamari - Served with Tzatziki sauce which gives a tangy, citrus taste to the calamari. The calamari itself was soft, encased in a light and tasty batter.

Beef Tenderloin - Prepared with red wine cream sauce. The tenderloin was a bit tough, though the combination of flavours with the sauce made up for it. Overall, a standard dish.

Tiramisu - The presentation was terrible. It was as if someone just slapped on a piece of cake in the cafetaria line. I had higher expectations of the Tiramisu, as it is an Italian restaurant. There was nothing special about this one. 

There was one server for the night, as I'm guessing that this restaurant doesn't get too rowdy. 

Overall, I wouldn't be back for the Summerlicious option, but Joey Bravo is a good local joint for some good Italian food at affordable prices."}
{"text":"It is NOT easy to find a Italian restaurant in the Scarborough area! Having Joey Bravo is really a breath of fresh air in the jungle of Asian restaurant.

Went there for lunch in the afternoon.. the place is empty and they do have a nice patio outside if you do want to sit there for lunch.

The bread basket was left on my table even before I order.. Those bread was so so good... I can eat the whole thing by myself.. :) I did almost eat the whole thing, I have to ask the waiter to take it away... :)

Though Joey Bravo has a lunch menu, however the prices are the same as dinner but just that the lunch menu is more limited in selections!

I decided on the Regular Penne in Spicy Tomato Sauce ($11). The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce have tons of garlic inside.. though not spicy but really have a nice kick in the taste. Though not the best value when compare to the lunch specials in the area, but it is refreshing to different things for lunch for a change!

The service is friendly and attentive. 

I will definitely be back again for lunch and enjoy some quiet time.

They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"Joey Bravo's has kind of become the family joint for my family. Everyone loves it and it's where we end up going whenever there's a special occasion and we know we want good food.

What's great about Joey Bravo's is that it is just as good as any Italian restaurant in Little Italy, but it's out in Scarborough. They have all sorts of delicious pasta, pizza, and salads for decent prices (generally in the $9-$18 range, depending on what's in them). They have a kids menu to take care of some of the picky eaters in my family. And the atmosphere is really warm and inviting -- especially warm if you sit next to the fireplace in their dining area.

Staff are friendly and helpful, and are really knowledgeable about the big wine selection they have here. We've even brought our own wine here a couple times with no problems at all ($10 corking fee, I believe). 

They also have a bar portion on the other side of the restaurant, it's not something I've ever explored, but it seems to be quite a hot spot, especially when there's a soccer game on TV. Joey Bravo's is a great local joint, but it's totally worth checking out even if you don't live in the area -- you can't go wrong with good service, great food, and great prices."}
