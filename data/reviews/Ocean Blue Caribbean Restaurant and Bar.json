{"text":"I have been discouraged by the many restaurants in the valley and I'm always very picky about the places I've tried in the past. Today was unique, I decided to dip my toes into this Caribbean spot since I've read the reviews. I got there after 8pm since I was starving and not in the mood to cook dinner so late, I decided to give this place my full attention. I noticed the details as far as the Jamaican music in the background, the décor made me feel like as if I am somewhere lost in Jamaica by the sea. Only the sultry breeze and ocean were missing. There was only one lonely chicken patty left so I ordered it plus ordered the oxtail with white rice and cabbage with carrots. I ate the patty first and was blown away by the flavor,  I had to look around to make sure I wasn't somewhere in Brooklyn. I can only imagine if they have a Labor Day parade party in there, it would be a success because their food is already authentic and flavorful. This was my first visit there and not my last. I will make sure to stop by again maybe on Saturday to get some more patties. This patty had my eyes closed and toes curled and when that happens, to me that's a good sign. Not at all disappointed and the employees there were very approachable and nice. I had my food to go and splurge at home, I ate my patty before exiting Ocean Blue and got so excited, wish they had more patties. Again, I was blown away. The only negative to me is that the patty was a bit pricey, $2.25 for one patty but hey, at least I can close my eyes and pretend I am in a hole in a wall in New York."}
{"text":"Took my niece here for lunch, thanks to Groupon bringing it back to my remembrance. We had jerk wings, curry shrimp and jerk chicken plate and festivals.  Everything tasted fresh, well presented and DELICIOUS! I love that their food is flavorful and spicy, like caribbean food should be.  The atmosphere is cute, with reggae music playing at the right volume and slightly corny island themed decor. Perfect ;-).  I love Ocean Blue and, unfortunately, realize just how close it is to where I live...I'll be trekking over for festivals and fresh made patties on the regular."}
{"text":"I first went here for lunch and was surprised by the buffet and how good it was. It's nice that it's different each day of the week. I've also come for dinner and the portions are good-sized. The jerk chicken, brown chicken, plantains, and beans and rice are especially delicious. My husband loves the coconut curry scallops."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first open. Food is always great! I love their fresh made sweet sauce that comes with the shrimp. The mango hotsauce they leave on the table is so good, I had to buy a bottle to take home. My husband loves the curry goat.The staff is always friendly. I will recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review strictly based on the service.  I normally would not proceed in this manner, but I was disturbed by the level of inadequate service received. To start this my first time and I really have had an intense desire for Jamaican cuisine for several months. When we arrived the bartender whom I suppose was the hostess and waitress, had the most unwelcoming attitude especially with this being a Jamaican style place, the culture and attitude is of love and patience of there were none.  She was mot attentive or polite, she was short and rushing. We ordered plantains to which my disappointment there were none, second there were no jerk chicken. Two dishes in which why you come to a Jamaican a restaurant. Neither times did she apologize for the inconvenience. Lastly we ordered water and had to wait exactly 12 minutes,  in which we had to remind her of. All this before I could even taste the food."}
{"text":"Had a groupon for 4 up to $144 meal. The restaurant looked pretty small, very nice looking place, very clean, dark lit and decorative. There is a bar that you can go to also. Buffet available too.  In terms of Service, pretty laid people. Very friendly and is always helpful when you need them. Water and drinks ordered immediately. Manager came to us to ask us how the food was. Good customer service.  The food is very very good. We ordered $118 worth of food and we did not have a complaint with anything. My only problem with this restaurant is the prices of the food, which is very overpriced. If you did not have any coupon, expect the bill to be very high."}
{"text":"My mom and I tried it for the first time last week..thanks to groupon. The shrimp salad was very crisp and fresh and sizeable.. chicken cassadea and sauce..very tasty.  We are very picky...but I can say we were pleased with the food, the waiter and the cleanliness...we have since gone back  for chicken stew and festivals, very flavorful..I just had to add a pinch of salt."}
{"text":"Well I,m back again, doing my pick up thing and I have some more winners.  The restaurant was pretty well seated and it smelled delightful.  There was a guy there biting and cutting his chicken wing.  I could smell the aroma and I wanted to say give me a bite of that chicken \"TACKY\" just kidding!  I must retrack my previous words in a review and say the All You Can Eat Bar looked inviting and I was quite impressed as the chief added more goodies.  Getting back to my pickup today, ummmmm! delicious, juicy, colorful and full-figured meaning the take out plate was loaded.  I ordered the Salmon with the fixins and the Curry Shrimp.  Good as ever!!!!   I'm rating 41/2,  I'm a big fan"}
{"text":"Ocean Blue is always good.  I've recently enjoyed a buffet during the week.  Jerk Chicken and Tilapia was good.  However, one of my favorites is the Ox Tail.  They never disappoint.  Staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean.  I'm getting hungry right now!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great. Saltfish and okra was over oiled and under seasoned. Irish moss was delicious. I would possibly return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Placed and paid for an order through their website online. Got there 25 minutes later and he said, \"I didn't even know there was an order.\" It was another 20 minutes for our food. Okay. No sweat. We can be patient. Then he hands me a receipt. I'm confused. I asked if he needed a signature. No. He wanted me to pay. I explained that I paid online. He refused. I showed him the email confirmation, but he still demanded that I pay. He said, \"check your statement.\" Giving him the benefit of the doubt, I do. Yep. It's there. But no, he still demands that we make another payment.   Didn't even get our food."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch as a result of a LivingSocial voucher, and return twice more, for lunch, also. The food is delicious. I love their festivals and curried shrimp. I tried their lunch buffet as well, but I'd rather order off the menu. The two times this young man waited on us, the service was good. When the lady waited, not so much. The biggest downside is that you will walk out of there reeking of food..."}
{"text":"I'll keep my review short & simple. Ok food & excessively long waiting time for your order to arrive. Judging by all the Bob Marley posters on the wall & his music playing in the restaurant... I'll say the workers are slow to cook & serve because they may be more concerned with being high than serving their customers."}
{"text":"I was incredibly pleased. My brother and I came in with a coupon, never having eaten Caribbean food before. The waiter was very nice and even gave us a complimentary \"sampler\" plate so we could taste a few items before we ordered. When the food came out it was delicious, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for caribbean food. Been here 2 times & hope to go again this weekend. Lovely food & lovely people. The server & the person who cooks the food always makes time to walk up to the guests & talk to them. Still waiting to try the pineapple & ginger root drink. They have always been out of it each time we went there. Love the Ox tail & the shrimp & the goat curry. The festives are really good. We used a Groupon therefore the prices didn't matter too much. Yes, the place looks a bit old & needs a new look, But the food is so yummy. Will certainly keep going & encourage others to visit as well."}
{"text":"Always friendly service and good food, however the service can be a little slow sometimes but overall good food."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Buffet a little toned down for American spice levels but otherwise good.  Try their fresh made juices like pineapple - ginger. All you can eat great for dudes with active appetites."}
{"text":"Service is good, owner is welcoming and decorations were cool (yes there is even a tiki bar inside). I ordered streamed whole red snapper with fried plantains and steamed vegetables. The sides are awesome, the fish taste good but just a little bit overcooked to my taste. I also had a mango pineapple ginger juice which is very tasty too. Give this place a try if you want adventure in different foods or you just feel like Caribbean cuisine, it won't disappoint"}
{"text":"Looks can be decieving! It's a little place. I got a Groupon for it tho and wanted to try it. It was like revisiting Jamaica! The food is great! Try the jerk chicken! It's fantastic! The fried chicken is sooooo fresh and good too! Oh! And the coconut curried scallops and shrimp is phenomenal! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Had a Groupon coupon and the counter boy refused to honor it. Kept using ridiculous excuses and even said to \"take it up with Groupon\".  As if his establishment weren't the ones who made the deal available through Groupon. Ultimately I'll get a refund but I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. My wife went to the restroom while the boy was arguing with me. She said the restroom was filthy and had no soap or paper towels. Disgusting. After she told me this I was actually glad the debacle occurred so I wouldn't have to eat there."}
{"text":"The food is good if you like very hot and spicy.  The two of us enjoyed a shrimp appetizer, goat meat, and jerk chicken.  The sides were also tasty.  The cleanliness and atmosphere were just so-so.  They must have a problem with people not tipping since there are several signs requesting patrons to remember their servers. (It does kind of look like a fast food place).  We were surprised when we received our $29 food bill to see that $7 was automatically added for tip.  Our service was good but I was glad I noticed the generous tip was already added on to the bill.  Not sure if we could have asked to have it removed, but we did not try. There are so many places in the area that are so much cleaner and better.  We wanted to try it, but will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Best in Arizona hands down!!! Its a piece of the Caribbean in the middle of the desert. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"I was so happy to come across this place, I ordered the curry goat with plantain and it was heaven! Wish i could have tried everything...Will definitely order there again!"}
{"text":"Very Very good! I had my doubts at first when we arrived, but after we got the jerk shrimp for an appetizer, I knew we'd be in good hands. The flavors were great, especially the curry. The service was friendly. Overall this was one of the best meals I'd had in months!"}
{"text":"Delicious! This was my first time trying jamaican food and it was amazing! We got the shrimp appetizer, grilled salmon, curry shrimp dish, and pie dessert. Service was great too, we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Fresh & hot!  Delicious. We could not have coconut so that made us curry shrimp special. Very good food. Very nice people."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight and loved it.  Staff was friendly.  Had jerk shrimp appetizer, wife had curry chicken, and I also had the spicy burger.  Unfortunately they were out of patty's otherwise we would have had those also.  The sides of fried plantains and rice were also great.  We have spent some time in Jamaica and have fond memories of the food there.  Ocean Blue brought us back to Montego Bay (without the ocean), and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, food mediocre.   Let's just say, the not so friendly gentleman was rude to me. We had a group come in and we were short chairs. He claimed that all seats were accounted for. I proceeded to tell him we were short and he got combative and was condescending.  I wanted to leave but my friend convinced me to stay. Food came out, it was just OK. I wouldn't go out of my way for their food. Just had their jerk chicken. I had better. Spices are not all the way there. The sauce was flat. Thought it would be spicier.   Fried plantains were saturated in oil. I have had other places and they aren't oily like these.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"We found this place totally on accident and absolutely  loved it. Great food and great service. I had jerked chicken and the spices were perfect. The \"festivals\" were amazing and I would go back just for those!!  Try it!!"}
{"text":"Saw the Grand Opening sign and decided to stop in. My meal consisted of a jerk chicken sandwich on white hamburger bun, an order of festivals (small cornbread type things), and juice drink (mango and pineapple juice mixed with simple syrup).   The jerk chicken sandwich was tasty, but really small. Not sure it was worth $5.25. The festivals were really dry. They could have used some sauce or gravy to go with them. The juice thingy was quite tasty.   In the end, I spent about $14 dollars and left hungry.   Did give feedback to the owner. Not sure if they will act on it."}
{"text":"The service is dedicated, though not as fast as people expect in Chandler. The staff is sparsely staffed and they worked their butts off.   I loved the jerk chicken wings, curried goat, oxtail and soursop beverage. The shrimp was tough, probably Individual Flash Frozen because the flavor was still there. The skewer flavor was lovely. The fried chicken was ok, but focus yourselves elsewhere along this menu. The beans and rice side is fluffy, not heavy. I have many good things to say and very few negatives. We really enjoyed ourselves. You can try three entrees at $19.99 with choice of two sides."}
{"text":"I enjoy the traditional style Caribbean food served. My favorite is the curried goat. My hubby enjoys the jerk chicken and fried chicken. Would give it more stars if it weren't for the wait time. Both times I've eaten here, the wait was one hour from ordering to food. Try the soursop blended drink, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The oxtail is unbelievable! Great service, cute small restaurant. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Service took quite a while and water tasted like it came straight from the tap. I ordered a salmon burger and it was fine but pretty plain for $9."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch today at Ocean Blue, and the food was delicious. This was our first experience at the restaurant so I tried the oxtails which were very tender and taste great. My husband had the buffet with blackened fish and jerk chicken and enjoyed it. The staff was very friendly and provided excellent service, good portions of food and reasonable prices. We will go back and tell our friends. JC"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while and the food has always been good. Unfortunately it is the service that kills this place. Today I watched them completely ignore the phone as it wrung with potential orders and they were out of rice and peas at 5:30p. Good luck ever getting a patty after 2pm! To the owners... Invest more in your service as I doubt I am not the only customer you have lost because of it. Just to clarify, they don't have bad service (rude people), they have no service. One person taking calls, taking orders, expediting, bar tending, cleaning, and helping in the kitchen. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat is the way to go. It's a small place, but the food is well worth it. Ive been to Jamaica before and the food taste exactly like on the island. Makes me want to go back to Jamaica."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a large group. Apparently only one guy is host, server, and bartender. We got there at 7:15 and didn't get our food until 9:00pm. He kept taking 5 peoples order then sending it into the kitchen, then another 5, then another 5, etc.  I understand he was trying not to back up the kitchen which probably consisted of 2 people max, but the problem is we didn't get our food at the same time.  Literally one dish every 5-10min came out. So once my friends were done eating, my food came out and then they got to watch me eat!   We took turns eating lol. Drinks didn't come out for about 30 min after we ordered it.  We felt bad for the guy trying to take on so many roles at once.  They are not used to large parties. Now let's get to the food.  There was a foul odor when we walked in. I guess we got used to the sewer smell after being in there long enough. But I wanted to throw up.  Disgusting.  I ordered the jerk chicken (per all the reviews on yelp) and the curry shrimp. For an appetizer we ordered the jerk chicken wings.  The wings were the worst I have ever had.  Don't order them. Tasted pre-cooked and dry as heck.  The only good thing was the jerk chicken.  Nice crispy skin and tender chicken.  I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Went in with a co-worker and fell for the 'buffett'.  It wasn't any good.  I could have had better from a frozen TV dinner.  The chicken was covered in black spices and the tilapia was deep fried with some kind of flavor I could not identify.  To make it worse, I tried using my Groupon discount and was denied because this was the 'special' and it was not accepted.  In the end, my co-worked ended up eating white rice with some terrible chicken and I had some heart burn city tilapia with white rice.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"We have tried a few different Jamaican restaurants on the west side and I have to say I would and will drive the distance for this place. The food was hot, fresh and incredibly tasty! Service was friendly without being overly friendly. The only negative, if you need the restroom bring a flashlight the lighting is really dim. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  I ordered a jerk chicken sandiwhich for my son who is a picky eater and he loved It!  My husband and I had the goat and it was really good.  My husband loved it more than me but I felt it was a little salty. (I have a low salt diet)."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the food  I ordered the lamb curry and it was amazing. The server was also very polite and attentive. I'll definitely be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"A lot to love, but a lot also fell short which to me is the true definition of a three star review. In all it was a true food adventure with a few missteps. Disclaimer before you continue I am a true novice to all Caribbean and Jamaican foods.  LOVE:   *The jerk chicken (YEEZUS!) You'd eat the bones if you could this is a glorious combination of spices cooked perfectly.   *Ox Tail (Another YEEZUS!) If you'd rather not have something spicy this is by far the best item on the menu it's cooked so tenderly and flavored so well.   *Festivals (a third YEEZUS! why not?) these are like hush puppies and cornbread but sweeter it is their best side dish.   NOT LOVE:  *Overpriced and small portions. I understand this is a subjective measure, but that's how I feel. They do have a deal on restaurants.com so it helps a bit, but still I don't think it's good value.   *Spice levels are not disclosed. The curry goat was fantastic, but with my Americanized tastes it almost killed me I was not expecting so much heat. Be careful ordering anything with a curry \"Jamaica hot\" is right around where \"Thai hot\" ranks.   *Service slower than snails. I like to think it's because the food is cooked that freshly but do be prepared for a lengthy wait. If they do not have fresh fried chicken they will tell you it is a 30 minute wait, but just about everything else takes that long as well.  *Not a good atmosphere. Everything feels old, not dirty, but not superclean either, the place is not well-lit, and it's empty. Perhaps take-out is the way to go. I'd say come for a quick lunch, but like I said it's far from quick.  *starchy sides. The festivals were great (I even said YEEZUS!) but everything else is too starchy, bland, or deep fried to add to the meal. Rice and beans in particular were very underwhelming.   I'd say try it once but expect some imperfections. Order the right items and have some patience and you will be rewarded."}
{"text":"Had  lunch here with Robyn N and Rand H. Well to start it is a small buffet with 4 chafing dishes , The good news every dish was very good. It has been quite a long time since I had some good jerk chicken and theirs was just like I was back in Jamaica . (yumm). They also had some tilapia that was really good . The other two dishes contained plain white rice in one and steamed veggies in the other. The $7.99 buffet was well worth the price and I look forward to many return visits."}
{"text":"Our first time trying Caribbean food. I had the jerk chicken sandwich and fries. The food was fresh and the service was good, but nothing about this sandwich would have me excited to come back. My sister ordered the jerk chicken salad, again it was fresh and the chicken was moist. Great service and enjoyed the freshness of the food, but missing the Wow factor I read on other reviews. Eat and live well."}
{"text":"Can't believe we have lived within 5 miles of this place for two years and just found it! Food is excellent and the drinks are just like sipping your favorite fruity drink on the beach! Ramon makes it fun as well! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Caribbean??? mostly Jamaican. I went for the \"buffet\". I did enjoy the food and the price was right at $7.99 for the all you can eat lunch buffet, HOWEVER, there are only a total of four (4) items on the buffet. You should understand that this review is only for the buffet. The menu looked good but the prices were between $11 to 17 for a meal. Try at your own risk."}
{"text":"Overall, my fiancé and I were happy with our experience at Ocean Blue! We were driving around, trying to find somewhere to eat when we came upon this little restaurant. It wasn't fancy, not very busy (on a weekend night), but after our server came to talk to us, I figured we would be in for a good meal!  Their menu consists of various Caribbean dishes (such as curry chicken, jerk chicken, oxtail stew, and so on), and each of their entrées comes with two sides of your choice. I asked the server what he would recommend between the Curry Chicken & the Brown Chicken Curry, and he said it would be like choosing between your kids. He couldn't pick a favorite, but mentioned that the Curry Chicken was more popular. I went with that with a side of rice & beans and fried plantains. My fiancé wanted to order the Jerk Chicken sandwich with fries, but our server suggested the Jerk Chicken with rice & beans and festivals. My fiancé really wanted to have fries though, so he got the rice & beans and fries as sides with the Jerk Chicken entrée.  I liked the taste of the Jerk Chicken more than the Curry Chicken just because the jerk seasoning was prominent and flavorful; both were completely different though. I am not a huge fan of fried plantains, but the ones here were really tasty! I ate them all! Each dish was a good portion, between my fiancé and me, we were able to finish both.  While we were there, quite a few other patrons came in. Most of them got orders to go, a few dined in, but they all seemed like regulars. The oxtail stew was a commonly ordered option, so I'll have to try that out next time. I saw they also offer a buffet for lunch, which would be nice to try out for variety. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent buffet with a variety of choices for a low cost! Authentic food. Good people and good service."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with friends from work.    I had the Jamaican jerk chicken.    The chicken was very flavorful.   The festivals were every bit as good as those I had in Jamaica.  The food was slow to arrive.  If you are going for lunch and are on a tight schedule this is not the place unless you arrive early enough for the buffet.  The price was high for the serving size.  Overall it was a nice change from the usual lunch fare."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try it. Had the Turkey Burger which I have to say was super good !! Maybe one of the best I've ever had. I really liked the Festivals (little cornbread-like thingys). Their jerk sauce is very, very good. I haven't tried much else, but because the pricing is high for what you get I can't give it 5 stars. Also, service can be slow. I waited almost 20 minutes for take-out. Order ahead."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars but there was no desert. Aside from that the food was amazingly addictive. I had the tilapia with coconut curry and with every bite I could not help saying mmmm. Had it for leftovers the next morning and the spices really kicked in. My friend had the oxtails and let's just say he cleaned his plate so well they didn't need to so dishes. Plan to go back soon. It's mainly made to order so call ahead."}
{"text":"We had the buffet lunch with rice&red beans, coleslaw, tilapia, and bbq chicken. It was delicious, and service was super!"}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant last night . It was  nicely decorated  and the waiter is friendly.  They gave us some free fried bread  which  was tasty but could have used some dipping sauce. We had their fried chicken which was good . It could have used a little more seasonings I did like the j erk  chicken it was flavorful.  The oxtail was  too salty and  overcooked"}
{"text":"I stopped and had dinner here on Friday. I used to stop and get the chicken curry patties to go. The patties are no longer, but I stayed to eat. When I arrived the place was empty, as I progressed through my meal the restaurant filled up with customers some of which were obviously repeat customers. Oh yum! I am so glad I had dinner here. I made a small plate from the appetizers available. I had the shrimp skewer, beans and rice and plantains. How can it be Caribbean without plantains?! The shrimp was skewered with bits of sweet pepper and a light tangy sauce. I could have licked my plate, but grandmother would not have approved! ; )"}
{"text":"Buffet was good. Jerk chicken, red bean rice, mac and cheese and grilled tilapia. Jerk chicken was tender and flavorful. Fish was a bit.dry but tasty. They ran out of patties. Will have to return to try those."}
{"text":"This restaurant is lonely their menu has a variety of food for everyone seeing as I am a vegetarian I had  the curry shrimp with scallops very very delicious the service always great and he is very pleasant I enjoy every time I go to this restaurant I would HIGHLY  recommend Ocean BIue if you're looking for some awesome island cuisine.."}
{"text":"Walked in not sure what to expect. Hubby likes jerk chicken, I've never had it. But with a Groupon offer, I said, \"Why the heck not?\" We were pleasantly greeted and asked our drink orders. Then food=we had the ox tails with veggies and plantanes and a order of jerk chicken wings. Both good. But that ox tail was so amazing I wanted to lick the dish. You gotta try this place. Casual location for some out of this world taste."}
{"text":"Really liked this place, we had a great experience!  Loved the Jerk Chicken and the Ox Tail, the Staff/Owners were so firendly too.  I'm glad we finally tried it and we will go back for sure : )"}
{"text":"So I purchased a groupon to try out the restaurant.  We went on Friday and could not use it, but I was not leaving, not after I saw the menu!.  We had a shrimp appetizer that was lovely.  My husband ordered the Jerk Chicken sandwich and I got the Curry Shrimp.  Everything we ate was wonderful.  We are going back again and again!"}
{"text":"My rating for this place is more like a 3.75-4, but because of service I rate it a 3.  We were there on a Thursday night and the place was pretty full. That being said we waited quite some time before the one guy serving/bartending was able to get to us. I will credit him for doing the best job possible! He maintained a helpful and friendly attitude despite how busy he was!  Now onto the food.... I absolutely LOVE Jamaican food and this place will be a go to when I get a craving.  I had the combo jerk chicken and goat curry with rice and beans and veggies. The chicken and goat were both full of flavor with a little spice (I think it could use more). They provide you a side of BBQ/jerk sauce on the side that I think is nice, but the chicken doesn't need it. Writing this review is making me want to go there now!  My husband had the ackee and saltfish with festivals, rice and beans.  Ackee is a native fruit but does not taste fruity! To me it has a texture similar to egg (creamy spongy).  The dish was good, but we both felt it could use a little more of the salted cod for the price.  The festivals were perfectly fried, cripsy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Festivals are fried little dumplings that are great for sopping up the extra sauce left on your plate!  If you order the right thing Ocean Blue definitely delivers! I mean really, why go to a Caribbean place and get a quesadilla?"}
{"text":"We are from Jamaica. Stopped for lunch/dinner. We ordered 3 different meals. Everyone was completely satisfied and will be coming back whenever we are in the chandler area . Very clean restaurant . Food is excellent and cooked fresh as you wait. Very friendly owner makes everyone feel like family. If you want authentic jamaican food this is the place to come. We've tried the other reviewed CARIBBEAN restaurants and they were dirty looking dirty tables and poor tasting food. Don't waste your money going anywhere else. You want authentic  tasting real jamaican food in an authentic  laid back setting not fancy at all,with 2 owners running it. This is the place you need to try. Prices on the high side. Didn't experience bad service in the early afternoon time frame. My wife said the oxtail was very good so that's a no brainer. The fish dish was good but very expensive. Would come back in the late lunch time when there wasn't a crowd."}
{"text":"OMG This place has the best tasty of tails so yummy I couldn't stop eating them everything was right on target I will be going back soon. Drinks are great"}
{"text":"Very middle of the road service poor.  $60 for two with groupon.  Friends had ox tail and jerk chicken they liked. Wife had salmon and thru away when we got home. I had salted fish and nothing to tell anyone about. Draft beer on menu but no draft beer. Don't see return visit in my future."}
{"text":"The $7.99 buffet sign drew us in on Saturday, but then we saw it's only offered on weekdays. We decided to stay anyway. We were the only customers there, which unfortunately did not change.   The server was a nice guy who recommended that I not get the jerk chicken if I don't like spicy food. So I ordered the brown sauce chicken, which was tasty, but a bit of a disappointment. There were maybe 8-10 very small chicken breast nuggets swimming in a big pile of onions and peppers and sauce. The menu did not mention the onions and peppers and I don't care for either. So I picked out the chicken pieces and then started poaching my husband's jerk chicken.   The meals we ordered were $10 each, and came with 2 sides. That's kind of high for lunch, especially when my chicken portion was so small, but 2 sides instead of 1 is a nice touch. I had the plantains which were adverstised as ripe, but they could have been riper and thus sweeter. They were very good regardless. But the festivals were great. They tasted like funnel cake fingers. I could go in just for some of those.    The jerk chicken was excellent, though it was spicy. If you don't add the jerk sauce, the heat level is just right and the seasoning is great. (While the jerk meal is $10, they have a sandwich special that includes a side and a soft drink for about $7 or 8.)  We will go back on a weekday so that we can try a few more dishes at the buffet and fine tune the ones we really like.   As far as the service, while it did take a while to get our food, it was made fresh and everyone was police and friendly."}
{"text":"The good was just OK. Being from NY I'm very particular about certain cuisines but was open to giving this place a chance. I was in rush for lunch so I ordered a beef patty and shrimp quesadilla to try something way different. The seasoning in the beef party was lacking. I don't think it was made fresh. Also the quesadilla was just not good in its execution or flavors. But I guess that was my fault getting a quesadilla at a Caribbean restaurant. I'm open to trying the food again since I didn't get the full experience but it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"$7.99 All you can eat lunch buffet Mon - Fri is one of the best options for lunch in Chandler. The Jerk Chicken is really good, the Talapia is good. Not a fan of the plantains here.  On the menu the Curry Goat is great, call ahead if you can because it takes about 15 minutes to prepare takeout food."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch with my family on a Saturday (no buffet) and ordered the jerk chicken and jerk turkey burger. Both meals were fantastic! The sauce on the turkey burger was delicious and a bit on the sweeter side. The jerk chicken was awesome, a little spicy, and came with more sauce on the side to turn up the heat. Also, the festivals alone were worth the visit! The service was friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Had the salmon sandwich with the strawberry mango juice.  Was very good. Staff was pleasant and place was clean."}
{"text":"I like the restaurant.  I like the guy who works there.  I used to really like the lunch buffet. Unfortunately my lunch changed from 11:30 to 1:00.  At 1:00 the buffet food has a look like it might have been there from 11:00  am and looks old.  I have asked but that's what ya get. So I can say the food is really good when they first open in the morning not so good as the lunch buffet sits."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Bought a Groupon as I had not tried the place and was very happy I did.  It is close to my office and will be a go-to place for lunch now.  They were a little under-staffed and the wait was long for lunch but the food was well worth it."}
{"text":"I have been craving for a Carribean restaurant near my work place for a while.  I've heard of Ocean Blue for a while but never made it there.  My friend Howie tried the buffet and said it was okay.  We decided to come back and order off the menu.   We got one of each Jamaican pattie on the menu: curry chicken, jerk chicken, beef, and spinach.  They were flaky but sitting in the warmer for a while.  The curry chicken was the most flavorful of the bunch.  Next we got the jerk chicken sandwich and jerk turkey burger.  Howie mentioned the turkey burger tasted like it was homemade.  My burger was okay, but the chicken was dry.  For the price of $5.95 / burger, it seems a bit steep for lunch.  The owner did give us festivals on the side for free.  We weren't really sure what a festival was, but it seemed to be deep friend semi-sweet dough.  Service was a bit slow with us waiting for refills and the check.  Overall, the meal was okay.  I've had better, especially at Breadfruit in downtown Phoenix.  I probably won't be back unless I get a deep craving for jerk chicken at work."}
{"text":"We had a group of 14 people, 13 were seniors. They were fantastic. Great food and great service!! I had the curry goat and it was very tasty. It does come with bones so if you are not a bone in person or the coconut curry shrimp which was also very good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Ocean Blue for the first time tonight and we were both really impressed. We had the combination plate with jerk chicken, curry goat, and fried chicken with rice and beans and festivals. Everything was really tasty. Our server was attentive and friendly. He even gave us fresh rice when he brought us a to go container for our leftovers."}
{"text":"We stopped by for the first time after a day on the road. I ordered the Quesadilla with shrimp. It seemed a bit of a wait, but I have to say it was worth every minute! This was the best Quesadilla I've eaten and there would have been enough for two. I left stuffed!   We are looking forward to trying the lunch buffet in the future."}
{"text":"Delightfully surprised with this restaurant, even though I was weary due to its strip mall location. Jerk chicken was great... may have been better than Jamaica! They offer a two-entree buffet that seemed to be popular during lunch. We'll definitely be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in and we were pleasantly surprised.  We got very different things and we were happy.  The festivals are out of this world.  I had curry chicken and it was delicious.  My husband got the jerk wings and 2 patties.  A fish pattie and a beef pattie.  He loved the fish pattie.  He says the jerk wings were very tasty but too big for him. (he like a smaller, more traditional wing)  overall we enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"Went back because a friend had a groupon.  Technically, it was a groupon wannabe from VoicePlaces.  We skipped the buffet and ordered off the menu.  We tried once of each Jamaican pattie flavor (beef, spinach, jerk chicken, curry chicken), and made 2 safe sandwich choices (jerk chicken and jerk turkey burger).  The patties were all tasty, and they were a good value at only $2 each.  I particularly liked the curry chicken and the spinach flavors.  The sandwiches were disappointing... very small with no side dishes for $6 each.  The waiter threw in a free order of \"festivals\" for us, but they weren't as festive as one would imagine.  They were just fried dough and empty calories.  Think beignets without any powdered sugar.  So, it's worth checking out this place for the $2 patties and $1 beers during happy hour ($2 Red Stripe), but that's about it.  Nothing else seemed outstanding or a great value, and the ambience leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"We had a coupon. So decided to try it. I ordered goat. I eat goat a lot at Indian restaurants. There's just something about the consistency of the meat that is unlike any other. I love Indian food because of the spicing. I thought it was my favorite ethnic food. Not any more. Caribbean food is around the Phoenix valley. For the most part it's Mexican with mango or pineapple in it. Not at Ocean Blue (Jamaican) Caribbean Restaurant. That goat had flavors that I've never experienced before. You could actually find the whole fresh spices they used in making it. The meat was perfectly tender, melded with a taste that I've never experienced before. For the first time I've tasted true Caribbean food and it's just as profound in its flavor as good Indian food. But, it's no where near the same. I've found something new that is now on the top of my list of my favorite foods. The portions were huge too. I got Caribbean slaw and mixed vegetables. Each portion was huge. My plate was running over. Each course had unique spicing that I have never experienced before. It was just wonderful. My wife had a shrimp salad. The shrimp were big and wide, deliciously spiced and only cost a few bucks. So you can eat on a budget here too. They have all kinds of foods, including hamburgers if you are so inclined. My next visit, I'm going to have the ox tail. Because my excellent server told me that was his favorite. I've never had ox tail before. Have you? My wife can't stand hot food. She was wondering if the jerk chicken would be too hot for her. So our fine server brought out a whole chicken leg for her to sample (imagine that). I ate half of it. So I can with authority recommend that spicy delicious treat too. We had lots of leftovers to take home. The atmosphere in this marvelous restaurant was definitely Jamaican. Lots of fine grade bamboo furnishings give it elegance. It's a place you can take someone you want to impress with your taste in unique food."}
{"text":"It's been less than a year since my last review (July).  This is also the first time I've been back since then.  We had a \"restaurant.com\" certificate to use here.  The certificate is not honored for the buffet, so we ordered off the menu.  I had their fried chicken, my wife had their jerk chicken.  First...the fried chicken is fresh.  It takes 25 minutes because they don't fry it till you order it.  I like that.  When it came out it had an interesting look to it.  This is not the medium brown fried chicken of KFC.  It was a light, almost yellowish, fried chicken.  And it was very tasty.  I liked it.  The jerk chicken was tasty as well, but didn't seem quite right...until we dipped it in the jerk sauce.  Yowza.  Some serious heat there.  But THAT was jerk chicken.  The sides I ordered were vegetables and rice/beans.  The vegetables were a disappointment.  I was told steamed cabbage and carrots (I'm not a fan, but I try to eat healthy stuff anyway).  It was mostly cabbage.  Very little carrots.  The rice/beans were OK.  Nothing special.  The flavor wasn't as robust as I expected.  My wife ordered the rice/beans, and the fried plantains.  She loved the plantains.  Service was sketchy.  Just the one guy behind the bar who tended not to clear tables until someone came in needing a table.  Then he'd stop chatting with whoever was at the bar, clear the table, and seat them.  He also didn't really check on us at all.  Of course, in such a small place I could get his attention easily if I needed.  I think this is worthy of three stars.  If you read my review from a few weeks ago you'll see I really liked Caribbean Spice.  This place is OK, but Caribbean Spice is better."}
{"text":"Wow! Great flavorful food! We were very impressed!!! We had the Ox Tail, Curry Chicken, fish cakes, rum cake. All homemade and full of flavor!!! Plus Great Service!!! Can't wait to go back and try more!!!"}
{"text":"Moving from New York to Phoenix was great ! But I was missing my Jamaican food until I tried this place. It's a little pricey but I didn't mind. I was looking to have a good Jamaican meal for About a year! Service was great and food was excellent."}
{"text":"Great oxtails!! I've never had festivals before but this will not be the last time. I'm already excited to come back"}
{"text":"The ox trail here is excellent.  While the entree portions are nut large, they are packed with flavor.  The jerk chicken is swine, right off the grill.  Don't be tempted by the lunch buffet that lounges on the counter.  Order a fresh cooked meal, and you won't regret it.  Also, try the festivals and fried plantains as the side.  They go great together!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat, it was a treat! I went here with a group that included 6 adults, and 4 children. We were all happy with our orders, and the portions, and service were great.  I must say I grew up on Jamacian food, since my dad is from there. The curry chicken was amazing, and the rice & beans were perfectly cooked.  This place is a must for people who want to try food from the island."}
{"text":"WTF. What the guy said about pulling a scam, is some what true. They didn't charge us extra for a meal, but made everything extra CRAPPY! I ordered jerk shrimp, chicken wings, salad, and a sandwich. I thought I found a new place for my sister to eat but no, no. I had the amazon coupon which I believe made them think it's okay to make us sick. Which also means they don't care about their customers, Just the money. I was going to come back, but not after serving me raw food. All of my shrimp was raw, squishy, and still had poop in it. Salad was bleh with hidden valley ranch? I hate hidden valley ranch. The sandwich gave my boyfriend diarrhea, and we've had Mexican food that's never done that. I'll never go there again, thanks guys."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful...the food is great...Ramon is the perfect host....will be back often!"}
{"text":"My first time eating Jamaican food. Absolutely loved it. I had curry shrimp and mango pineapple ginger.  Sauce on the curry dish was so yummy I used the fried banana side dish to eat all the sauce left on my plate.  It wasn't that spicy but when I felt spice on my tongue, I had my ginger drink to take the spice away.  There were so many on the menu I wanted to try. Jerk chicken, Ackee and salt fish, and ox tail.. Ingredients I tried from traveling to other countries before.  Eating here felt like traveling to foreign country without the passport.  Will come back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Took my family here and it was a big disappointment. The food was one thing but the service was also terrible. I noticed the food was previously frozen and then the one person that was there was behind the bar, hostess, waitress, and all positions that were needed. I will never go back here mainly because of the horrible taste of the food. Nobody in my family liked it so I wont waste my time or money here again."}
{"text":"Always happy to find a new spot to try for lunch and saw a friend had bookmarked Ocean Blue and I asked her if she was up to giving them a try, said yes so made plans for lunch and off we went.  Arrived around 11:45 and already knew I wanted to do the lunch buffet, they have a weekly buffet that changes daily for 7.99, and for that day  it was steamed white rice,  curry chicken, potato salad, and steamed fish.    I tried everything, and I have to say I was pretty excited to try the curry chicken , but sadly I was not able to eat it, it just was too salty to me, the potato salad was perfect and the steamed rice went well with the fish and let's talk about that fish, I did not come to try the fish, it was an afterthought but after I tried the fish, holy cow that was some great fish, also on the table was a unlabeled bottle, I asked what it was and found out it was a pineapple mango pepper sauce , so I put a little with the fish, and BAM! That added some great flavor & heat! If you cannot handle hot stuff, maybe you should stay away from the sauce, but for me it was amazing! Even put it on my rice, so good!  I've only tried the buffet, so I can't attest for the rest of the menu, but I am happy to had found them and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I just got back from a trip to Jamaica and were looking for good Jamaican food here at home.  We found it at Ocean Blue...a small but cute place; service was friendly and very good at multi-tasking; the food was terrific and very authentic.  After reading some of the other posts, I'm surprised - perhaps a different cook the night we were there?  Either way, the portions were more than generous; shared a Patty; both had the jerk chicken (very good!) beans & rice and the plantains were delicious.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing awesome authentic flavors.. Love the jerk chicken and wings.. The goat was sooo tender.. I am going back for ox tail"}
{"text":"Love Ocean Blue for its goat curry and oxtails. I'm persnickety about my oxtails - but Ramon & the kitchen staff will give you a reason to come back: stellar service, authentic Caribbean spices, & tender juicy gelantinousness! Don't sleep on the rum punch either."}
{"text":"The had ackee and salt fish...'nough said."}
{"text":"Go in for the buffet and I guarantee you will not be hungry after. The food is so good and reminds me of the say my mother and grandmother make food. It's definitely a family operation."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty,  and looked appealing.   It did take a while to serve,  but it was worth the wait.  There was only one person on the floor, he was polite and made sure our drinks were full.  Overall, it was a great experience, and I would come back again."}
{"text":"The food was simply disgusting. No flavor, cold, tough meat and they have even managed to screw up fried plantains. Delivery took 1.5 hours and even after all that time they served a sub par product. I will not be patronizing this establishment again. Hot pot is 1k times better. On a lighter note the delivery driver was nice. Note to the restaurant, if you intend to make it in this food serving/delivery game you need to step up your game, a lot."}
{"text":"Didn't like the service, too slow, and Jerk seasned items didn't have that sweet spice/savory flavoring that most Jerk items have. Most have that grilled taste also, theirs didn't. The fried chicken was over cooked.  The Festivals were terrible weren't crispy at all! just tough and doughy.  The Jerk Chicken Wings just taste like hot boiled chicken wings with darkend skin.  Glad I had a coupon so I didn't have to pay full price. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the ox tail and goat with plantains and Jamaican cole slaw as sides. I grew up eating goat and my husband grew up eating ox tail in the south, and we thought both were delicious and well cooked. (Note- order goat alone, not with any other proteins. It has a very unique flavor and doesn't mix with other proteins). I ordered the curry shrimp and jerk chicken. The jerk chicken was spicy but not too spicy, incredibly moist and authentic. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and tasty. We can't wait to go back. The festivals are a great side as they are mild, and a bit sweet. A bit pricey, but honestly, worth every penny."}
{"text":"I got some dish which i couldn't pronounce it's name. I had it before but at another place, and i really liked it there. Here though the tortilla is actually underneath the food already and soaked with the \"sauce\" of the food. I wish i knew it would be like that. I would have asked for it on the side so i could place the food inside it and wrap it up to eat. I prefer doing that then having it premade and drenched for me.  The place was definitely nice to go to and look out the window as we ate.  Wouldn't mind coming back, but definitely not something you would go out of your way for."}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived before noon and it was not busy. We stood and waited 5 minutes for a table, No one even  greeted  us. We were the only Caucasians in there and it seemed to us that  they were not willing to seat us. We left feeling that the restaurant had discriminated against us."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great food and atmosphere. This is a local hole type place but very clean and fun inside. I went with a party of four and no one left food on their plates.   I had the jerk chicken salad and tried the festival (type of biscuit) which are really yummy!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was okay. My biggest complaint is the service. I walked in and the guy working didn't even acknowledge me with a hello after I greeted him. There was only two people in the establishment. I then asked for my to go order and he still didn't speak. Then handed me my bill silently... Gave it back and he only spoke to say here is your change cause I wasn't looking at him. Customer service goes a long way. Ocean blue is lacking in that department. The oxtail was delicious and he curry goat was average. Improve your customer service and tell your employees to open their mouths when customers come in."}
{"text":"Was here awhile ago and ate the Aki and saltfish. Great island flavors. They also have a bar, which features island inspired drinks"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend because my husband ranted and raved about their authentic Caribbean food. I had the saltfish which was amazing.. I love the atmosphere and vibe you get from the place. Def recommend."}
{"text":"I am an open minded person- ate hear recently twice- buffett. Food was really good- nice spices etc. I recommend now for lunch."}
{"text":"Lord have mercy! Best Jamaican food and drinks in Arizona hands down. Oxtails!!! Curry Goat!!! Brownstew chicken!!!,festival!!! Very authentic food. Only one waiter there so the service is slower. But I would suggest the buffet for lunch."}
{"text":"The food was good and decent , being that I have had a lot of good Caribbean in Brooklyn New York it's hard to say that this food was amazing. But it was decent and good flavors the plantain was really good the food was a little on the salty side but yummy I had the brown stew chicken it was ok and I also tried the curry chicken it was good! And the ocean blue fried chicken wasn't out of this world but was ok too. Service was good. Over all a 3.5 star"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for dinner 4 stars for buffet  Definitely worth going for their buffets (esp when they have the jerk chicken). Had dinner here as well which was good but wasn't worth price and the service was very slow (only one girl for a full restaurant - felt bad for her but she managed to keep an upbeat attitude)."}
{"text":"Delicious and inexpensive buffet.  For $7.99, you get your choice of 4 different trays.  Sodas here ($1.99) are Pepsi product based.  Today at the buffet there was tilapia in brown sauce, jerk chicken, red beans and rice, and pasta salad.  The tilapia was excellent.  It was seared on the outside for a more crispy texture and had moist flaky meat.  The jerk chicken was also superb, pretty spicy, with juicy, flavorful, fall-off-the-bone meat.  The red beans and rice were excellent- I went back for 3rds for just the rice!  The pasta salad, just OK, your standard pasta salad.  While it would be nice to have a little more variety, on the other hand, I'm glad that they can excellently prepare a smaller selection of food without compromising quality.  Will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I love Caribbean food and am always looking for new places, even though I order the same thing: jerk chicken. I had a coupon from restaurants.com and paid just a couple bucks for a $10 coupon. I had the jerk chicken, plantains, rice, and a Red Stripe. I was a little worried about my wife because she is not a fan of things too spicy and she does not like curry. She asked the server for recommendations. He was very nice, offered up a suggestion, and she was very pleased with the dish. Very nice atmosphere with reggae music, nice island theme décor, and a friendly staff. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Good food, been here many times. Just be prepared because the service comes from Jamaica. All good though."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is unlike anything I have ever eaten. Be sure to get a breast and a thigh!"}
{"text":"Victoria M. treated a group of us to dinner here over the weekend and I was excited, as I've had Ocean Blue bookmarked for quite some time now. We had a late dinner (7:30) so we were unsurprisingly 1 of 2 tables in the restaurant, which is small but quaint. The service was a little on the slow side, but I'll attribute it to what looked like one server who was also manning the bar. Growing up with a lot of this food, they have a very authentic menu. I opted for the oxtail plate, and the rest of the table had curry goat, curry chicken, and jerk chicken. I would say that the prices are on point for the plates, which came with 2 sides and a hefty serving of the entree. I was very pleased with the oxtail which I ordered with rice & beans and festival. I tried some of my friends jerk chicken and the spice is something to note. They serve the jerk sauce on the side because it is very spicy for unassuming diners. They ran low of some of the sides that were ordered so our server brought out an order of festival on the house (which is so bomb). I don't think we waited too long for our entrees to come out, maybe about 15 minutes. We wrapped up our meal with 2 slices of sweet potato pie which is probably not the American-ized version you are thinking of, but it's delicious nonetheless. I'm glad that I got to cross this off of my bucket list and I would recommend them to someone looking for some good Caribbean food in the valley"}
{"text":"Service: 3/5  Slow moving and orders were messed up a bit but staff means well, very friendly and do their best  Food: 5/5 even though the service isn't awesome the good makes up for it. It is absolutely delicious. Definitely try jerk chicken, festivals, and curry goat.   I really like this place and I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"The location is beside subway at Chandler Blvd.   The Mango pineapple ginger drink was great, they said it made from the scratch,  but I could''t judge, LOL, it was great and not too sweet.  The appetizer, Jerk Shrimp was great too. It had a great sauce light brown, it seasoned well with a kick of spicy. So for you who cannot eat spicy,  you might wanna request less hot. The shrimp was fresh and not over cooked.  For Jamaican Sangria, they used rum and hibiscus.  The oxtail was soft and tear off easy from the bone. It very well seasoned and so great with plantain. It's a must try menu.  The curry goat also awesome. The meat not smell at all, soft, and cooked perfectly.   Overall it was a great experience included the staff who was very informative, friendly, and fast service. Highly recommended.   The price is average."}
{"text":"I had curried goat and my wife had jerk chicken. Both were VERY delicious and the prices were great. The waitress seemed to wear a few hats, but she was still very attentive and SO nice and accommodating! Some of the sides were traditional foods and were fun to try, even though i was not too crazy about them, like the dumplings, but we had fun and loved the experience!"}
{"text":"friendly employees and good food. Environment is inviting, very calm and chill. food is delicious. employees are always helpful. drinks are delicious. seriously, give this place a go."}
{"text":"The food was good, but that it about all.  The service got two things wrong on the order, and took a long time and had to ask for more beverage and water.  We had greater expectation for the ambiance based on the prices, and maybe a little more to the dishes...  we were talked out of the Festivals (because they take too long), and the rice with beans... but decided that they were simply understaffed for a Saturday night..  I might go back to give it a second chance and try the saltcod, but if the experience is not better it'll be the last time."}
{"text":"My dad took me to this restaurant a month ago and when I saw a Groupon for it recently I bought it so that I could take my sister. The little Jamaican guy working at the restaurant on Thursday, July 28th, 2016 said to me, \"Hey, I recognize you; you've been here before; I'm not taking your Groupon.\" First of all, why would a guy at a restaurant be so rude as to try to embarrass me in front of my family? Second, why would he not want to accept a legitimate Groupon sold by his company? The food was decent but the service here was EXTREMELY bad. I've never had an individual be so rude to me in my entire life. I would never go back to this restaurant and I would recommend you don't either. If I could select negative stars for this review, I would. I also intend to inform Groupon that the individual working at this restaurant is trying to not honor their certificates and see if they will stop issuing them."}
{"text":"Went here a few months back. The food was good but if you are in a hurry service can be a little slow because food is cooked to order. The Jerk Chicken and Festivals were great and my girlfriend had the curry and scallops and really liked that as well. Overall I was really pleased with my experience here."}
{"text":"Delicious food, you wouldn't expect. Don't get me wrong the place is clean and has very friendly staff. You just would not expect such high quality flavors and skill - if you are judging just by the location. This food could easily be served at the beach on an island pampering your tastebuds. Amazing bang for your buck."}
{"text":"My first time at a Caribbean restaurant and I loved it. I ordered the rice & red beans, jerk chicken, and the veggie mix. My goodness... it was all so good & the drinks were strong and very affordable prices. Our server was very kind and fun, he gave us a sample of all the food before we ordered. I really enjoyed this restaurant and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I drove all the way from N.8th St to Chandler bcuz I was craving rice and beans with oxtails-I'm from New Orleans so I'm very much a food critic anywhere I go - lol- the oxtails and rice and beans were Amazing- the food was very well seasoned and the portion was so much I took some home -I also had a rum punch drink which was exactly like the ones I had while visiting Jamaica-delicious potent -Ramon was extremely friendly and provided excellent customer service- looking forward to tasting the curried goat next time-Highly recommend Ocean Blue-great job !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always good and hot. I've even tried new dishes, from servers choice. I always come here."}
{"text":"Delicious Jamaican food. Jerk chicken is an obvious favorite, oxtail is good. All the sides are exceptional here which might be my favorite part. I always enjoy the service and my experience, but things are laid back here so if you're in a rush maybe go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had the salmon burger and it was very very good! First time here and I will go back again. I did 5 stars because the server was great, the food was great, the ambience was fun. The price was good. It was a bit of a wait but worth it. Give it a try, support local always!"}
{"text":"FINAL UPDATE: I can't come here anymore. I used to be in love with your jerk shrimp until you got a new chef. My mom and I came in here and asked if the jerk shrimp sauce could be made more mild, but the waitress told us that the sauce is made in bulk and was already made the day before. She gave us some sauce to try, but as expected it was extremely spicy. We got the friend chicken instead and it was pretty good. My boyfriend and I decided to give their jerk shrimp one last try. We got our plates and it was inedible. We both just picked out our pieces of shrimp and didn't eat any of the vegetables in the dish, just to try and get some of our money's worth. Our noses were running and eyes watering, no joke at all. Between each bite, we would have to gulp down our drink and munch on festivals just to get the flavor out of our mouths. Our mouths were on fire for a solid 10 minutes after we paid our check and left.We should have gotten our money back because we couldn't even enjoy our meal. We both love spice, but this was just horrible honestly. I felt like I was going to puke right after I left but it soon went away after I drank some water and got some fresh air.  UPDATE: I went here again with my Mother. We ordered our usual, Jerk Shrimp. We got the dishes and they were extremely spicy, almost inedible. Our noses were running and it was hard to keep your mouth closed, even after downing our drinks. We finished the dishes because we didn't want to be rude. If I had brought someone else here, they would have returned the dish without a doubt. Luckily my mom and I can handle some heat, so we just made the most of it. There was a sign looking to hire a new chef, which probably explained the extremely spicy dish. A new chef, so the dish would have room to be inconsistent. Understandable. Just drop some heat.  I loved this restaurant so much, as did my boyfriend and mother. Sadly none of us will be back. The new cook has ruined our favorite dish that we specifically come for. If someone wants to add in so much spice that it has your nose running and stomach turning, let them add it in themselves. I don't see the point in ruining the sauce for everyone else. I'm keeping the 2 stars because of good experiences in the past, good service, and a nice atmosphere. However I will not be back. I love this place! Everything I've gotten here has been absolutely perfect. I love their jerk shrimp dish! They only have it as an appetizer, but they make it into an entree as we request it. Great service, we really appreciate it! Their festivals are to die for, they're such a nice treat. A little bit sweet, but not too much. Their fried plantains are also really great! Their beans and rice go great with any dish and are great to mix into the sauces. It's a smaller restaurant which allows for a more casual feel, and is pretty relaxing. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Well my experience was different than previous Yelpers.  Maybe I went in with '\"hole in the wall\" expectations as soon as I had a look around, maybe Ocean Blue took a little time to get on it's feet.  I went for lunch with some coworkers and everyone seemed more or less happy with the meal.  I had a jerk chicken appetizer (1.95) which was kind of a pocket filled with mildly spiced chicken.  It came with a side of jerk sauce which was complex and spicy.  I followed that with one of the daily specials, 2 fish tacos.  It was flour tortillas with very tender and sweet tilapia, some cabbage and other leafy stuff and a sweet, slightly smoky sauce.  I added some of the jerk sauce to throw some heat on it.  I also had an iced tea.  How much for the app, 2 fish tacos and iced tea?  $9.70.  Not bad at all.  They also have a small lunch buffet which is refreshed often.  It had four dishes-a white rice with some veggies, broiled tilapia, potato salad and some kind of roasted chicken.  While we were there they changed the fish twice and switched to BBQ chicken.  I'll be back to give them another shot, maybe try the all-you-can-eat buffet for 7.99."}
{"text":"Awesome place we stumbled upon as out of town business visitors. Loved the jerk chicken and shredded veggies.  Thanks! Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. I had high hopes of the food, but was somewhat disappointed. It wasn't nasty,  it was just nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Can't speak on the food but waiter was rude af. Was with a group but they didn't have enough seats so I sat at the bar. No problem. Asked to put in an order and was told to wait a minute. Waiter took the order of our table and when he walked by I asked again if I could put an order in but he told me to wait a minute again. Waiter walked over to another table across the restaurant. Waited a bit longer and he was still trying to chop it up with the two ladies at the other table. Walked out after that."}
{"text":"I've had brown stewed chicken and made it before and this is by far, the worse ever. The chicken wasn't tender, its boneless chicken breast that they cooked quickly and tossed in the sauce. The sauce isn't the brown stewed I'm custom to tasting and kind of sweet??? It's not stewed at all, it's peppers and onions. The veggies are good! The plantains were hard and cold , it's been years since I've been here and I'll probably never go again."}
{"text":"Looking for a fun Caribbean spot? Gotta come to Ocean Blue!   A couple friends and I decided to try this as part of my goal to try more international foods around the Valley. It's low-key/not terribly fancy in an unassuming small strip mall. My kind of place to find low-key good food! It wasn't terribly busy when we stopped by so pretty much we had the bartender/server's sole attention. He was really helpful with selecting what to eat and drink. I was feeling festive so I ordered their punch version of a Dark N Stormy. Holy alcohol... that packed a punch!  The menu is mostly chicken and fish with varying Caribbean spices. While they offer some American food, I wouldn't go for that...stick with the purpose of eating there! All of us went with one of the traditional dishes, myself the Jerk Chicken Island Style with veggies (festivals) & plantains. I cannot pass up fried plantains, and these were great. If you order 1/4 or 1/2 a chicken, it will be a 1/4 or 1/2, not shredded or \"chicken strip\" type. I think I went wrong with getting the plantains and festivals though, as it just didn't seem like enough to eat. I cleaned my plate and left still hungry. Next time I should probably not come ravenous."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was how hot the restaurant was, despite a nice cool 80F day outside.  The service was island paced (slow), but they were kinda nice. There was a buffet that let you serve yourself if you were in a big rush.   The food was mixed. The breaded fish was in a delicious red sauce with okra.  The jerk chicken was juicy and had a nice and flavorful kick. Rice and beans were dry and lacked much flavor.  Overall, my experience was mixed."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Best home cooked food in the Valley. Ox Tails are tender and tasty. Jerk Chicken wings are incredible!! Staff are friendly and outgoing. We will not only be back, we will be regulars.. We love Ocean Blue. Duke Wellington"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant our server \"Ramone\" asked us if it was our first time there, and I replied that it was my first time ever trying caribbean food.....so he offered us a sample plate which was so awesome!  We were so impressed with the service and food, that were already talking about when we are going back!!!  If your looking for a nice quaint restaurant with great food, service and prices.....give \"Ocean Blue Caribbean\" a try!  I loved the jerk chicken with beans and rice....and this type of bread called festivals."}
{"text":"Surprisingly small, but they were able to accommodate a group of 10 luckily (we took up the majority of the floor space). The lunch buffet had limited options, but bottomless jerk chicken, coconut tilapia, and rice were out of this world. I only had lunch, but I would guess that lunch would be better than dinner."}
{"text":"I suppose I was just surprised to see a single vegetarian item on the whole menu- the veggies plate... which was simply three sides put together. The cost was accordingly diminished, but my husband, a friend and I, all vegetarians, all ended up having the same dish, with slight variations to the sides. The cabbage entree was simply boiled cabbage - no seasoning. The sides were wonderful and rustic and reminded us of a wonderful wonderful meal that a bartender once made us in a hurry in Tortuguero when we couldn't find places to eat late at night. But we didn't walk into a bar at 11 pm to compromise. We are pretty sure the food is all wonderful, but if they added one or two more true veggie entrees or appetizers that could be combined, I'm sure chandler and ahwatukee would notice more."}
{"text":"Very relaxed atmosphere. I came here with my girlfriend a few weeks ago looking to try something new. Our meal was definitely interesting! The drink that I had (pineapple ginger juice) seemed a bit overpriced, but my soy burger, rice/beans, and fries were filling! My girlfriend had a chicken and seafood combo and enjoyed it. I thought that the meal was \"pretty good\", not amazing but definitely acceptable in a pinch."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place about 4 times now.  Each time, we left with mixed feelings.  The place is pretty small and is usually busy.  Sometimes, the server is too busy to notice new customers so they stand by the door, not sure what to do.  Some just leave after waiting for more than 5 minutes.  When the server is around, the service is pretty good.  We understand the place is understaffed, so that is why we kept going back.  We usually get the buffet, which consist of 4 items.  The food is very good when available.  It takes them about 10-15 minutes sometimes to refill.  If they are out of anything, they do not bring out any substitute...you still have to pay the full price.  It doesn't matter if it was out before you start on the buffet....so check before you get it.  This happened a couple of times only an hour into the buffet.  I never ordered from the menu and am glad.  It takes a real long time for the food to come out.  Every time I am there, someone would order off the menu and sit 20-40 minutes for their food to come out.  If they order something that is served from the buffet, they will get it faster because the server grabs it from there."}
{"text":"I have not really had much Caribbean food, so I decided to try this place out since it is right near my house.  I wasn't sure what to get so I went with a recommendation from the server of coconut curry shrimp and scallops (white rice and plantain sides).  I also got a side of Jerk Wings.  The coconut curry was quite tasty (Very different from Indian coconut curry), as was the shrimp.  I was especially impressed with the scallops as they were cooked just perfectly.  My problem with the dish was that it was very little scallops and shrimp, and almost completely peppers and onions.  It was still all quite tasty, but I agree with some of the previous reviewers that it was a bit over-priced for what it was.  I expect to pay around $14-$15 for a seafood dish anywhere, but I would also expect it to include a bit more seafood.  The wings were tasty as well, and the jerk sauce was explosive.  I was glad I tried it, because there were good, but too spicy for me to want to get again.  I think I want to go back sometime and try their lunch buffet, but it is timed pretty poorly for me to be able to do it."}
{"text":"Me & my wife try this restaurant the other night on a referral from a friend. Curry goat was delicious and my wife had the oxtail which she like also. Good service & overall cleanliness of there establishment."}
{"text":"It's a small place, not a ton of atmosphere but it is clean and has a fun tiki hut/bar. If you like authentic Jamaican food, this is your place. My husband had chicken 2 ways: jerk and fried.  Both tasted good and juicy.  I had coconut curry scallops and shrimp .. I liked it better than the chicken. They found out we were celebrating my bday and they let us choose any appetizer we wanted on the house - so nice.  We chose the jerk shrimp. Delish! Had a lot of heat which we like. We are definitely going back. Rum punch was good too!"}
{"text":"Great little place I went to for the lunch buffet. Legit jerk chicken! Would definitely go back. No much frills to the place, but great food."}
{"text":"Went to Ocean Blue yesterday for lunch with my wife.  The food was actually very good.  My wife had the classic jerk chicken.  Me, I had the ackee & saltfish.  I appear to have surprised the waiter, as I knew what ackee was, and was trying to explain this to my wife.  Both of us were very pleased with the food.    It is a casual place, with a big bar, but neither my wife nor I drink."}
{"text":"If your in this area this is a must come and eat!  Guarantee worth the trip and nicely priced."}
{"text":"Just returning from vacation in Jamaica I was anxious to get more Jamaican food. This place was so good.  All they need is Ting. I will definitely be back. Try the brown stewed chicken with rice and peas and festival. Festival is like it's own little dessert here even though technically it's not. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Reminded me of my dads food! The service on the other hand was okay. I feel like there should be more servers there."}
{"text":"Drive all the way from Tucson for this place! That curried goat is perfectly seasoned and tender. Groovy vibe. Wish had more vegetarian/pescartarian options. Chill little spot"}
{"text":"Very good food located in a cozy little spot.  I will definitely be back to try something new and delicious."}
{"text":"The chicken curry is simply amazing hands down the best chicken curry I've ever eaten in any state or country.  Worth the trip from anywhere in the valley.  Downside is loud music - service fair - attitude not so good - other dishes average -"}
{"text":"Caribbean food, YUM! I have been here three times, two times for the buffet and one time to sit down and eat. I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and a side of oxtail gravy. I am a sucker for some good grilled chicken, to top that off with some jerk sauce, I might as well been dreaming!  When you come here and sit down and order, don't plan on getting your food right away, they do it right, they take their time and make sure the food is cooked fresh. Be patient, have a couple drinks, and just chill.  One thing I would give them as a suggestion, ask what flavor the customer wants their jerk chicken, those of you that have had jerk (anything) you know you can get it mild, medium, or spicy. I like mine SPICY! I don't want to take anything away from the meal that I had, however; this option would have been great AND I probably would have taken some on the plane to take home!  I'll be back to Phoenix soon and I will definitely make a trip to Ocean Blue!   Ya 'Mon!"}
