{"text":"My mother bought tickets for my husband and I to go, she really wasted her money. Rockin' R promised us a delicious cowboy style dinner with all the fixin's and a great floor show. To start with, they only serve two things to drink, water and lemonade. One pitcher of each drink is placed on every table, and when it's gone, there are NO refills. You have to take your tray and go stand in line for food (suppose to be part of the cowboy charm). Dinner consisted of either beef or chicken. They don't tell you that the meat is DROWING in their barbeque sauce, which is TERRIBLE. We also got a baked potato, cornbread, which I hate, applesauce, which I can't eat because it upsets my stomach and spice cake for dessert, which I also hate. So out of all the stuff on my tray, I could only eat the potato.  Rockin' R serves you what they want, if you dont like it, TOO BAD. The floor show started and it was boring. They sang old cowboy songs, had some \"ghost rider\" ride past the windows on the barn, did some rope tricks and a bunch of other dull stuff.  For 60 bucks, we could have had a nice dinner some place else. I've been to better dinner/floor shows for LESS money. Rockin' R caters to older people which is why my mother liked it. But anyone in their 20's, 30's and 40's will be bored with it. Not to mention, the food was so HORRIBLE. The same people who serve the food are the ones who put on the show. You have to wait until everyone is done eating before the show starts because the entertainment staff is in the kitchen. I've been to other dinner theaters where you eat during the performance. Rockin' R was the worst I've been to, with the worst food and the worst show and I will never go back again. And I will never recommend it to anyone. Stay away from Rockin' R. LOUSY!!!!!"}
{"text":"this is a review of the wedding venue not the wild west show. my wife and i had our wedding at rockin r ranch on 3-20-15. our wedding was fun because we made it fun and decorated the venue beautifully. the reason we are giving this place 1 star rests on the lady who runs it mary. from the very beginning she was difficult to work with and acted as if every request we had was an impossible task. they waited until the very last day to clean the area that we had our wedding and only did that because we told them to that day. mary failed to show up at our reheasal and when we called her she finally came because we wanted to go over some final requests. the venue was covered with dead leaves and dog poop. there was a non functioning water heater in the bar that was an eyesore and an open barn door with christmas decorations hanging out that we had asked to be covered. they threw a white linen over the water heater and leaned what looked like a big piece of plywood against the barn. what was quite possibly even worse than mary's incompetence was her staff's. the bar tender could not make simple drinks, was on her phone and i kept having to remind her of what we were and weren't paying for. she also disappeared for a half hour and nobody could find her. there was a wedding planner included with the venue that we didnt know about until the last day and honestly he tried his best but he was not helpful. we had complaints of the serving staff slopping food onto guests plates splashing food everywhere. the worst part came at the end of the night when it was time to settle our bill. the bar tender was having trouble figuring out the bill so mary came out to help. mary then gave me the bill and it was not adding up. i asked her why it was so much and she claimed that we had more plates served at our wedding than we payed for. she also said there were 56 mixed drinks served during our cocktail our which seemed like a lot for 45 minutes. she was back pedaling throughout the entire conversation and when we asked her about the bill she had very little evidence as to why it was more and just took off $300 right away as if they were just trying to see if they could get it from us. we still feel like we overpaid but were lucky to get that taken off. i would definitely not reccomend this venue for your wedding. although we made our wedding really nice we still feel like we were cheated by mary and rockin r' ranch."}
{"text":"DO NOT hold any private events here. Rockin R Ranch apparently ignores noise ordinances, but is surrounded by residential areas. Loud music and other party noises means the police might show up to your event. Awful! Please stay away and spend your money somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"We are from Chicago and came to Arizona for a visit. We took the whole family to the ranch. We were beyond disappointed with our visit. We got there at 6pm. All but 2 hot biscuits were gone. Everything was closed up. There were no signs saying if we were allowed to go inside the corral with the baby goats to pet them. We couldn't find the pony. Our 3 and 6 year old complained about the music being too loud and screechy. So we went for ice cream, which was closed. Overall, a VERY bad experience. I called to see if we could be given any sort of compensation since we paid over $30 a person and all the lady argued was that what they promised was there. Would have been nice to have some guidance for the out of state guests to know what to do. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I wrote a review for this place a few months back and find it interesting that it's not listed anymore.  The place is expensive, cheesy, had horrible food, run down facilities and the religious overtones were creepy.   The one star is for the goofy cutouts you can put your face in - other than that, definitely NOT worth the price!    First review: Horrible food, run-down venue  - NOT worth $30/person.  The one star is for the goofy cutouts that you put your head in so you can take pictures of yourselves.  The entertainment (used very loosely) started off with a cowboy reciting pig Latin (or whatever that was) rhymes outside.  Then we all were ushered inside and instructed how the dinner line worked (I get this.)  BUT then he has us all pray.  After dinner they offered homemade ice cream that you had to pay EXTRA for!  What?!?  We pay $30/person for day-old, stale, flavorless, \"world famous\" BBQ and then are expected to pay extra for ice cream?  This coupled with the religious theme was unbearable - we snuck out before the end - it was so uncomfortable and weird."}
{"text":"This review is for the food only. Growing up in northern Arizona in cattle country I was excited to hear about a a good ole cowboy dinner. Unfortunately, this was not it. The beef was extremely dry and the barbecue sauce did nothing to improve the taste. The chicken was tender and just okay. The biscuits and the coffee cake were also just okay. The cowboy beans were well below average. But the biggest transgression is to claim you have a great cowboy dinner and to then serve bad beef."}
{"text":"This was well worth the price and the money. We loved taking our children to shows like this in Branson, MO. Fun entertainment and delicious food (and we are quiet the food snobs)! The BBQ chicken melted in your mouth and the beans really were my favorite- haven't eaten beans that good besides at home ever. Applesauce was one of the best I've eaten as well as the biscuits cooked over the fire.  I appreciated hearing stories about the family history of this ranch.  There were good musicians and singers as well- it was a lot of wholesome, good, clean and corny some times, fun.  I can't wait to take my grandchildren some day."}
{"text":"I have lived in the East Valley for 24 years and had never been here.  I remember driving by it on Baseline Road as a teenager (before the 60 extended past Power Road), and thinking what an odd place to have this venue in the middle of the farming fields.  Now, I think what an odd place in the middle of suburbia.  It is a bit touristy, so I probably wouldn't go back and I probably wouldn't take family visiting from out of state either. We visited on a Friday night.  There was a decent crowd, but not overly congested.  Majority of the visitors were elderly, (I'm guessing snow birds or from the surrounding area retirement communities). The other minority seemed to be families on spring break.  I probably wouldn't recommend going here if you are a young couple without children.   The entrance opens at 5:30pm, which is plenty of time to mill around the small \"western town.\"  My son wanted to spend the entire hour panning for gold.  There was no charge for this, and seemed to be a favorite of all the children attending, as the trough was full of excited children playing in the murky water full of rocks and small pieces of pyrite.  Before the show, they had sarsaparilla, water, and beer available to purchase.  The gift shop and sweet shop was open, but that is about all there is to see before dinner.  Approximately, 10 minutes before dinner the man selling the beverages, which I believe his name was Cookie, came over and told a little story, and invited us inside for dinner.   Seating is all pre-arranged; it was easy to find your table and seat number.  Next, Big Jim, an owner, comes out and introduces himself and gives a little history about how his family came to be in Arizona and information about their working ranch.  Afterwards, it was time to get your dinner.  However, Big Jim leads everyone in a \"blessing of the food\" beforehand.  I will say, it was a little weird sitting in a room full of strangers, blessing (praying) our food.  I am not an overly religious person.  I have many friends from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Buddhist, Latter Day Saint, Christian, Seventh Day Adventist, Catholic), and I respect all religions and religious beliefs, but I was a little uncomfortable obliging this ritual at a public setting.  That's all I have to say about that.  Dinner was very orderly and organized.  You are called up by row and it is \"buffet style\".  There was plenty of food on my plate, so much so that I couldn't get to the food underneath all the meat.  Finally, I had to go get an extra plate just to clear off the top layer of food on my heaping plate.  The chicken was flavorful; however there was very little meat the bone.  The beef was ok; my husband thought it was the better of the two.  They also served applesauce, beans, biscuits, and spice cake.  Everything tasted fine and I ate a little bit of everything.  However, I wouldn't visit just for the food.  The lemonade tasted like country time mix, but they were generous on the pitcher refills for every table.  Which was a relief when you are sharing a pitcher per table with a bunch of strangers.  After dinner you cleaned up by taking your plates to the back and the show started. The show was cute, a little long for sitting on a wooden picnic table bench, but tolerable.  They sang a few songs that I recognized, paid a special tribute to the veterans in the audience, and sang the Arizona State song.  While they are singing there are two large screens showing a video of pictures on the side of the stage.  I'm not entirely sure how long the show was, but my husband wanted to duck out.  We stayed because my son wanted to see the gunfight after the show.  The gunfight was a little \"cheesy\" and in my opinion not worth staying for.  My son thought it was the best part of the night.  Of course, it was way past his bedtime, he was exhausted and could hardly keep his eyes open. Overall, it was a different family night out.  I won't be visiting again. If I had to choose a place to take out of town guests, I would drive down to Old Tucson Studios or Tombstone.  If driving to Tucson wasn't an option, this would be an ok alternative."}
{"text":"It was interesting. I wasn't sure what to expect, I was taken here by my family and didn't do any research on it. That might be the best way to experience something like this. When I got there I was a bit worried. This is a mormon run establishment and I wasn't sure they had a bar that served alcohol which concerned me a bit because to watch a show like this I need some encouragement from a few beers. We did find the bar upstairs in the Saloon and we had some libations while listening to a girl singing and playing guitar. She wasn't bad, sounded pretty good. All of the sudden everyone cleared out around 6:30 (heading to the main hall to eat). Luckily we waited about 20 minutes then headed on over (be careful not to bring beer out side the saloon they don't allow drinking anywhere else on the property). Thankfully we entered about 5 minutes before the food was served and didn't have to sit through 30 minutes of story tellin' by the main cowboy. The tickets were purchased through deal chicken and it came out to about 20$ per person and we have VIP front row seating which is always nice. We also were the first into the food line. I noticed some people said they didn't get an \"all you can eat\" experience in the previous reviews but I did. I had 3 servings of the chicken which was actually pretty tasty and two potatoes as well as beans, biscuit, cinnamon bread thing and some sort of beef slice (not so good). This place is not really a restaurant so I am not sure what other reviewers were expecting, but for cowboy food served up in a line it was just fine. I would have liked to have something else to drink other than tap water or lemonade but what are ya gonna do? Long story short, the main show started and I realized the people that were serving drinks and food all night were the people in the show and they are all very talented. The music (although it's not my cup of tea) was very good and it kept everyone entertained throughout the show. There's something to be said for a family run operation like this where they run the entire place all evening. I was going here expecting to get my enjoyment from the cheesiness of it (like watching a b movie) but was pleasantly surprised that I got my enjoyment from the show and the fact that it was run by a family of hard working locals. I think the 40$ regular price per head might be a bit steep, but for 20$ it was a good deal and all in all it was a fun night."}
{"text":"Honestly, I feel like many of the reviewers are a bunch of haters. The singrs can't sing? I felt that they did a miraculous job, especially for a crowd that was as enthusiastic as a bowl of dead frogs. All of them in my opinion were great singers. I actually found myself envying them - they get to play their instruments, sing, and crack jokes and make people laugh every weekend... and during the week they put in hard work out on the ranch. To me, they live life while the rest of us go to work and then spend a lot of our time killing our couch springs by watching Jersey Shore garbage (I don't watch TV, thanks). Were they some sort of 5-star band that should go on tour? No. But they were genuine - they had fun, and they were lively. And truth be told, I'm not even into the song and dance type shows.  The food was pretty tasty, but not something I couldn't whip up myself. Pretty basic, but I was full with what I got. I think everyone was in the same boat. No hungry people at my show. For the price I think I got a deal (food plus show). If the food was more of something to write home about, I'd bump the review up to 5 stars.  As for the religious tone that others mentioned yes there was a prayer before serving the food. Now, I've been ALL over the board on religion - so much that I don't even know where I stand today. There might have been a time where I was offended at a prayer... but I found it to be low key, short, and tasteful. To me it actually added to the genuine demeanor of these people. They prayed and so they shared that part of their life and belief with you. You weren't forced to bow your head, pray, or say Amen before getting your food. They didn't ask God for you to repent - they just thanked God for having nice people to eat with. Religious or not, what can you find wrong with someone thanking you for being there and spending part of your life with them as a friend? I was honored.  The only thing I can truly knock the place for is that the bartender gal was slow as molasses and hard of hearing. We asked for XYZ and she totally forgot half the order and moved on despite that we were still standing there. It took her a long time to  realize that we were standing there because she never finished our order out. I suppose we could have hollered at her but I'm just too mild mannered and laid back to say something.  Last but not least, the gun show at teh end was pretty cool. Maybe not for the young kids as the guns are loud... but I liked the show because it was funny... and I like guns. :)"}
{"text":"I thought this place was adorable! I definitely think they need daytime hours on weekends, so children of all ages can enjoy this gem. I am not a fan of Western Music, but the concert is very cute. The food was wholesome and flavorful! I enjoyed my time here!"}
{"text":"Reading Tonya's review was quite shocking. I absolutely love rockin r. My family and I have gone there since it was opened in 1984 and it is always great. The food is DELICIOUS! The chicken literally falls right off the bone. The lemonade is delicous and contrary to the other review, you are allowed as many pitchers as you want (my family had 3). The music is fantastic, the atmosphere is enjoyable, and the food is great. It is a wonderful place. It is great for families, couples, out of town guests, EVERYONE! Dont miss this Arizona gem! It does not get the praise and attention it should."}
{"text":"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting it to be campy, and it was, but there also was a good amount of production involved in the live music show.    There were several other acts (hoop dancer, magic show, gun fight) going on through the evening that each performer venue directed the crowd to (and kept the night moving), but the real gem here is the main music show.    I'm amazed that this family is still doing their show, and it is incredible.  A musician myself, I'm usually leery of such acts, but their band had a magnetic energy (and playful onstage banter), Big Jim and Sweet Mary can still SANG and their fiddler rivals the speed of light!  Very tight harmonies, a medley of moving patriotic songs & spirituals, and a healthy amount of crowd interaction.    The band serves you through the dinner line, engaging visitors when the line lulls.  It is a humbling realization when you see them up on stage after dinner doing their thing.  They ran out of chicken about 2/3 of the way through the line and gave out ice cream vouchers to those people.  However, even without the chicken, they fill your plate.  I did not leave hungry.    I bought 2 vouchers through BuyWithMe for \"2 VIP tickets for a barbecue buffet, ice cream, and high-energy stage show\" for $40 (so, $20/person).  According to their website that should include \"VIP Seating / Includes Chicken and Beef Combo Meal\" and costs $36 per person.  What actually happened: it was not a buffet, but cafeteria style - one run through, one serving of each.  We did not receive ice cream vouchers with our dinner tickets, and did not receive VIP seating, unless if everyone else used the same VIP seating vouchers, and we were just four rows back in the VIP seating (out of five rows total).  So, that was disappointing.  I don't think it's worth the full admission price.  I enjoyed it, yes, but, even for the novelty of the show, I'd cap the adult price at $20.  Overall, though, it's a good place to bring the kids.  They successfully recreated a completely different era for children (and adults) to lose themselves in, and get some history at the same time.  There is a lot of standing for acts other than the dinner/stage show, so not the best option for older folks or those with back problems.  Also, you'll enjoy it more if you choose a cooler month - only the stage show/dinner is inside.  My final word?  It was worth the voucher price and was a nice alternative to the standard dinner and a movie.  If I go again and bring the kids, we'll pop in just for the dinner/show and leave afterwards."}
{"text":"Our administrative staff booked the Rockin R Ranch for a team building activity.  It all started off fine.  The old men playing cowboy were cute and you couldn't help but humor them.  The food was just ok, but we weren't expecting much.  But the night took a turn for the worse when the entertainment started.  It was a holiday themed show so when they started off with Jingle Bells and other catchy tunes, we clapped and sang along.  But then all of a sudden things got weird. They started singing very religious songs and playing a disturbing movie in the background.  It was almost cult like, and very inappropriate.  I am Christian and even I felt very uncomfortable, like they were pushing religion on us.  It totally ruined the experience for our whole team and we couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"I've been to Rockin'r a few times through the years mostly when I have out of town visitors. I love this place. I love the people, the place, the show and especially the food...their coffee is the only coffee I love to drink black! It's a simple fun evening. When the doors open, there is a perfect amount of time to enjoy the petting zoo, sweet shop, a beer and all the other fun little things going on there. People wining about the prayer are probably wining about everything around them...they are what's wrong with this country!! so put a sock in it!! I absolutely love that there are still values somewhere. I really missed not hearing the song about the Old Flag but I'm thinking it's because of the Christmas songs...........LOL yes I said \"Christmas\" Rockin'r, keep doing what you do!!"}
{"text":"This is a WHOLESOME family fun event.  And I mean that both in the good way and the bad way.  It's a Mormon family that owns it, and that isn't a bad thing, but this is obviously not going to be an event with alcohol, cursing, or anything disturbing.  We brought 6 adults and 6 children under the age of 9.  Clearly this is a show that kids love, whether the gunfight at the end, the activities before the show, or little things like the ghostrider song with a real rider in sheets outside the theater and then making a brief entrance.  The songs were good and... wholesome.  Probably like a show in Branson, MO would be.  Anyway, feed is decent for what it is.  But for the love of GOD, stay away from the chicken.  It wasn't edible.  In fact, it bordered on undercooked, and looked boiled witth a thin layer of barbeque sauce baked on (not grilled on).  The beef is like thin strips of roast beef, well done, slathered in a mild BBQ sauce.  Apple sauce was tasty, beans were just okay, potato was small with a pat of butter.  Biscuit, non-greasy and just perfect, was delicious with the bottle of honey at the table.  You drank the equivalent of lemonade crystal light.  The show is about 1.5 hours of singing... quite long.  All in all, it's about a 3.5 hour piece of entertainment.  So who do I recommend it for?    1) Families with young kids, especially ones enthralled with \"cowboys.\" 2) AZ people bringing in families or guests from out of state that lean towards enjoying wholesome, somewhat \"cheesy\" fun.  Specifically, if they say something like... \"let's do something very southwest... or better... old west.\" then you are on the right track... much better than old town Scottsdale. 3) Older people that like theater out of something that felt like it could have been a reenactment of a cowboy themed dinner shoe in the 50's or 60's.  If you are a young couple or middle age couple without children, I doubt you will find a lot of fun in it.  And remember, don't get the chicken!"}
{"text":"My husband and I left the cowboy dinner theater after the song \"Elijah.\" The audience was asked to practice and chime in \"an Indian war cry\" as \"Sweet Mary\" donned a headdress, placed her hand in the \"how\" position (think 1950s Lone Ranger) and crossed her arms. My husband is Navajo. He said he could tolerate the cheap looking headdress (straws and feathers?), but the audience being encouraged to do the \"Indian war cry\" was too much. His concern was the children in the audience would learn that it's okay to do that and believe those things are true. He was way more kind than me. It is 2017. Someone in the musical show or family should recognize this is not okay.  The website says it's family friendly and hospitable/we'll feel comfortable. Not the case. Not for my family.  Old west town was cute and fun. Food was good - especially the Dutch oven biscuits and the BBQ chicken. Silly jokes and cheesy puns were all good. We enjoyed everything until that song. Please update your repertoire to include all peoples and cultures in respectful ways."}
{"text":"I took my cousin from out of town to see this place, I bought the VIP seats on line 2 weeks before we were to go.  The atmosphere and décor of the place is very authentic but needs some work.  The railing going up the stairs to the outside of the salon and the railing around the upper deck are very loose and at some points I would consider dangerous.  We had to stand in line for over an hour although we had printed out the tickets in advance.  The lady in the ticket window had never dealt with this before and she was the only one in there.  There was no manager or owner on site to address the issues.  The show was to start at 630, by the time we even got to the ticket window it was 7pm and there was still a long line.  I got my money back as I was so frustrated and embarrassed at this point I didn't even stay for the show and dinner.  I will never go back and definitely wouldn't take out of town guests there."}
{"text":"My Mom bought a coupon from somewhere thinking this was just a BBQ restaurant and when her husband wasn't interested, her and I went last Fri night.  With the $25 certificate, it was an additional $39.  Quite pricey for what you get, at least in my opinion.  This is an old time ranch and from what they told us, they used to (still do?) raise thoroughbred horses here.  The grounds are nice, you could see a gazebo and an area with trees that would be nice for a private party.  There were several buildings, for $5? you could \"pan for gold\", for a few dollars you could shoot a Colt 45.  The young kids around seemed to be enjoying themselves.  My Mom and I wandered to the \"Parlour\" where there 2 guys playing the fiddle, ukulele and singing.  While they weren't great, they were pretty entertaining.  I noticed most of the people sitting around were seniors.  It wasn't until the show was almost over that Mary (one of the owners?) came around asking if anyone wanted a drink, I guess there was a bar upstairs.  My Mom doesn't do stairs so we never made it up there.    After awhile they let us in the dining/show room that was laid out with rows of picnic style tables.  The emcee, one of the owners talked about the ranch itself, it's history and explained how the food line worked.  You bring your ticket and they give you a tin plate and you walk thru a small line where they plop food onto your plate.  I know they say it's all you can eat, but I don't understand if that's true, why only those who pay extra for a combo plate get both chicken and beef.  A scoop of applesauce, a baked potato, a few slices of mediocre beef covered in BBQ sauce, a spoon of beans and a small square of spice cake.  At the end of the line you take a plastic cup for the lemonade pitchers on the table.  Food was mediocre and certainly not worth the price we paid.  As someone else stated in a review, they do say a prayer before the email and I felt rather uncomfortable.  After the meal you have to bring your dirty dishes and cups to the conveyor belt in the back of the room; while they try and sell you $3 bowls of ice cream.  Ice cream should have been included for the price!!  It was rather awkward during the meal, no music, no entertainment.  You see the performers are in the back scooping the food!!  Just weird.  We had enough and left right after dinner, didn't stay for the show.  All in all it was rather cheesey and pricey.  I could see where this might be fun for kids, but for my Mom and I it was just not really a good time.  I won't be returning, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool experience. Wholesome fun for the family. Food is cowboy food. I think of you out the word \"cowboy\" in front of anything, it gives you an excuse for it to be mediocre. That being said, the food wasn't horrible. Would I come again for the food, no.   There are goats, chickens, and horses on the property. Fun to look at it along with the old western scenery.   The show was fun. The mix on the sound could have been a bit better. The vocals were a lot lower then the track they were playing. Reminded me of being at my grandparents house.   The family that runs this place is great. Very friendly and genuine. It's a place my parents would love."}
{"text":"Thought this would be a fun place to take my family from out of town... I was wrong! Everything there is 100% thrown together. There's absolutely no AC in any of the buildings (that they turn on). So we sit down for dinner, and it's so hot we felt uncomfortable to even eat. The food was terrible. Looked like a mess. Then expected to pay an extra 1$ for ice cream that melts before you even get it back to your table. We paid for VIP seats & that doesn't get you anything but 2 pieces of meat instead of one... All you can eat isn't true. They only serve Lemonade/Water because of their religion. & I feel as if their religion was pushed onto people... The \"show\" was completely thrown together, really weird. Nobody was that friendly there. The gun shows were cheesy. Very disappointed. Would not recommend to ANYONE! 0/10 !!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding family event! Great chuck wagon food and entertainment for less than $30 per person. This is a wonderful family production at the Rockin R Ranch: Dad and Mom (Sweet Mary), their sons, daughter, and a fidler providing a great medley of cowboy songs.   You can't help feeling satisfied and smiling after a great night of feasts and entertainment (all you can eat!)  If you are in the Phoenix area--this is a must!"}
{"text":"Quaint buildings pretty good food. Little petting zoo for the kids. The show was ok. Not the best but no where near the worst. Only complaint my party had was the lack of adult beverage at dinner. They close the saloon when dinner starts and you get a choice of lemonade, coffee, or water for dinner. I guess keeping in the authentic dinner."}
{"text":"Have to say overall disappointed. We paid for vip because we were told it was front row seats, it's not. They corrected themselves after paying extra that it's \"front facing\". That was frustrating. Then with the all you can eat, went for more chicken and they were out of chicken. Also, everything in the place is very costly. 5 dollar beers and pony ride. The pros: my son got to do the ropes and daughter got the free sweet treat. The food was awesome which is why I gave a 3* for the pros. Overall, way over priced."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for our family to celebrate an anniversary. I got a phone call at 10 AM that morning canceling a reservation because there wasn't enough people and asked if we wanted to reschedule. I guess a reservation doesn't mean anything and that our plans were ruined. I guess I should've trusted the bad reviews and not even attempted to get this restaurant a try. Will not attempt to go again and would not recommend"}
{"text":"There was NOTHING good about this night out. We went with a group and everyone thought the same as I do. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! When we arrived there was no one at the will call window. When a person did arrive they did not know anything about the group coming and seemed to be completely unaware that we had made arrangements. I had made contact with Mary numerous times and was told we would have great seats. After finally getting in we found there was NOTHING to do for the next hour. Rockin R Ranch is a broken down fake old town looking place. Sadly it is mostly junk that they are trying to pass off as something. The few walkways were either powder dirt that caused a lot of dust if more than one person walked. The boardwalk ways were uneven and half rotted, we worried about even walking on them. We finally climbed our way to the bar which is not handicapped accessible. There were 3 tables. Knowing we could not all sit down we went back down to wait for the \"show\" and \"dinner\". The most interesting part of the show and dinner was that they actually got over 50 people to buy tickets to this thing. There was no comedy or show other than some really bad singing and a guy that just would not quit talking about how his family was part of the first Mormons to come to Mesa. Then 15 minutes of the show was giving us instructions on how to hold a tin plate when we went through the food line.  It was really pretty sad. The food was not a step up either.  The beef was so tough that no one ate it. The chicken was iffy. The beans were flat, the applesauce was runny and in everything. Apparently you are given applesauce so you have a cool place to hold the plate. Well you had half a plate of cold applesauce and a teaspoon of all the rest. Then about half way through the meal a guy walked through with a FANTASTIC looking bowl of ice cream with all the toppings and whipped cream. After pretending it was available we were told it was FOR SALE back in the back for $5 apiece. We had paid $40 apiece for our tickets. I was embarrassed for the family that is trying to make a living by taking money from unsuspecting people looking for nice night out."}
{"text":"We love this place. Yes the outside is a little run down but the people running the show are fabulous and the kids could care less. What you go there for is the SHOW! It is awesome and very entertaining! These people are world class competitors and they are playing for you. We have been 2x and its always worth it. We often tell visitors that they need to go. The food is pretty good."}

{"text":"Pre-Mother's Day Dinner. All 6 of my party enjoyed the entertainment. The performers each with their own skill were exceptional. We purchased the combo meal for our ticket selection. That is where the star was dropped. Plenty of food but not everything was delicious. I enjoyed the chicken, beans and apple sauce. I did not care for the beef. I found the meat to be tough with too much sauce. I would recommend this for a family outing or when people come in from out of town."}
{"text":"Instead of buying tickets online, I made an effort to go to the location  weeks in advance and purchased specific seats in the front row. I would have our  hearing impaired daughter  with us that night and I wanted her to be able to read the lips of the performers.   The night of the performance, we went early sat in our seats and after 20 minutes we were then was asked to move by another customer who had purchased tickets for the same seats.  'Sweet' Mary the owner, (and I say that lightly)  had absolutely no concern that I came in person early and purchased the tickets for those seats, that our deaf daughter lip reads,  or that we were already seated. She escorted my party of 6 to another table further from the stage. As it came to be, there was another group of people who were sold those same seats.  The same section of seats sold to three separate groups of people...Very very poor management. Extremely poor customer service. I paid nearly $200.00 for fair food, and to be treated as if i had stolen the tickets I had purchased.  Honestly, it wasn't the situation that was hard to swallow, it was that my honest complaint fell on the deaf ears of 'Sweet' Mary who did not bat an eye at taking away what had been honestly paid for and couldn't have cared any less that our hearing impaired daughter was moved away form the stage.  Take your money someplace where it is appreciated."}
{"text":"Fun for little kids... cute and cheesy. But If you don't have kids or not going with people that have kids  you may not want to stop in.  we came in from out of town to visit friends whom have children. I believe the kids had a good time. Food was actually pretty good.  Follow directions on how to hold the plate... its not a joke."}
