{"text":"First time here today and the beer list great ! Got pizzas and they were all very good! Cute place in the flats with good beers on tap and great food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great beer and the pizza Is amazing.  All the bartenders are super cool as well."}
{"text":"So, Beerhead wasn't our original plan for dinner after we got married but I do have say we ended up having a great time. Our server (wish I could remember his name) was great!  We sat on the patio and got to enjoy everything happening in the flats.   Would I rush back for the food? Probably not.  They don't have French fries. I would go back for the atmosphere and the service."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday afternoon, not busy at all.  The space is pleasant, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  They had plenty of tvs to watch the Browns lose.  The menu is 90% beer but that really isn't my thing.  The food options were in line with what the beer motif.  The food is good, with unique flair.  I tried the angry carne sub.  Basically a meatball sub with spicy sauce.  The ingredients are quality, the meatballs were made from scratch, and the whole thing tasted great.  If you want to knock some back and watch the game, this place is a solid choice.  I wouldn't recommend going here if you actually want a meal.  Lastly, the parking situation in the flats is mess.  It's designed to promote valet parking.  Don't fight it, just pay for valet."}
{"text":"Go here if you want to drink, not to eat the food. Should be on the bar list not the restaurant list."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I had the Queen pizza, it was so good! Super fluffy and fresh. Pages and pages of boos on the menu (as one would hope for a restaurant called beer head). Casual, seat-yourself, wait staff is very nice and friendly. Wall opens up to outside seating like a garage. TVs have sports on. Sofas as well as tables outside with modern fire pits. Great atmosphere, right below the bridge. Beautiful city. Pretty trendy place I loved it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful bar in the flats! The area has really been redone and this bar is great. Huge selection of beer, obviously, and great service. Our waitress was super attentive and made great suggestions. I can't recall her name but she has a Saint fleur de lis on her wrist. She's a huge asset to this bar and we look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Service on a Sunday was great, bar maid was super nice.  Best selection for a brewski.  Pretty sure I'm not going to eat there, menu could be changed."}
{"text":"Friendlier, more attentive service in the most recent go around. There was some live music on a Friday night. They are doing a lot of things right, and seem to be one of the better options down on the East Bank."}
{"text":"What is wrong with the service?! So slow, please avoid. Couldn't even get our check without a 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in 2 weeks. I love the atmosphere . So many craft beers to choose from. Great pizza. Every Friday night there's an event down there called flat out Friday's . Live bands. Food trucks and surrounded by great restaurants ."}
{"text":"Beerhead has an outstanding beer selection! The environment is really fun and is an excellent place for a group of friends to hang-out. Especially if you and your friends enjoy craft beer! The prices of the beer is pretty comparable to what you would find while you are out anywhere but there is a wide range of prices depending on what you would like to try. I've also tried their pizza and pretzel appetizer which were both amazing. The server was extremely friendly and beer educated. I plan on going back... often! The downside of the place is trying to find a safe parking spot for free on the street instead of paying for it at a public lot across the street."}
{"text":"CLE is great. But this place is the worst. The management (boldy) would love it it if you went else where and you should. Go to coastal or anywhere else else on the west bank. Bad service and this guy could care less. Seriously, he's that guy, don't like your service, its your fault. It's really bad."}
{"text":"I want to like the place but I keep having a hard time.  Great Location? Yes Good Bartenders? Depends Is the food/pizza good? Sure Do they have tons of Beer? YES.  Is the beer laughably expensive? YES   Do they move all 50 of their taps? Probs not I have been served $12 beers that have clearly been sitting in the line or the bottom of an old keg and been charged full price. I have also paid $15 for a beer, just to say I did, and it was terrible (like really stale/old) Stupid me! You will also see beers that are pretty common, sold for multiple dollars over the \"going rate\" around town."}
{"text":"Even during a busy festival, Beerhead provided great service! The beer list is incredible; everything and anything you can ask for, AND the staff is knowledgeable. My group only had the pretzels, but the pizza looked and smelled incredible and the rest of the menu has plenty of options. This is a perfect date spot and the views are incredible."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying what a great place! We are from Youngstown and my girlfriend and I wanted to get away for the weekend. She wanted to check this place out in which I didn't mind. It had a cool unique vibe to the place! The fire pits outside made it even more attractive. We sat at the bar and I asked the bartender if they had any gluten free beers. She said let me grab someone who can help you out with that! Nick! What a bartender! His knowledge is through the roof! My girlfriend had an amazing experience ( it shows this morning lol). She was able to try so many different ciders and gluten free beers and nick was able to help her with each drink. Me on the other hand I don't have a gluten issue. Nick asked me what type of beer I enjoyed. I told him three different kind and throughout the night I enjoyed three beers similar but different and I never had! Everything was great. The staff was great but Nick went out of his way to make my girlfriend feel normal and was able to try so many beers! Our next Cleveland trip we will be back and hoping nick is behind the bar!  Pros- EVERYTHING Cons- Nothing except wish you had a small GF food menu so we can eat and drink. But oh well we will be back for lots of drinks!!"}
{"text":"Do not go here!!!  My friend and I went here and we were the only ones in the entire bar! We ordered Southern Tier Christmas Ale and when the bill came it was $12 per beer!!!  The bar tender even apologized because he didn't know it was that expensive.  The manager overheard and came over and was extremely rude!  I can see why no one is in there!!! Do not go here!"}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst service I've ever experienced in a restaurant. Our orders were wrong, our waitress continually sped past our table without acknowledging us or checking in to see if everything was ok, and the food was completely average. 90 minutes and 60 bucks later, I'm so irritated that we spent our time and money in this place on such a beautiful afternoon."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated so low. Pizzas are great (Farmers Market) and a bunch of different beers. Not to mention the outdoor seating in a nice area. I recommend at least a visit."}
{"text":"Great pizza when they aren't out for 24+ hours? Some of the staff are amazing, and others are the most miserable humans on earth."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, food is mediocre. Six of us dined for lunch. I ordered a pretzel as an appetizer to share, but it never arrived. When I mentioned it to the server, she said, \"Oh, do you still want it?\" No apology, just an offer to put it in after all our meals had already arrived. Had I known it would take 25 minutes to appear, I would have declined. The pretzel showed up as we were boxing up our leftovers. And we were still charged for it. Again, no apology. This is my second time visiting. During our first visit, the food took forever and the manager comped a meal without us even asking. I don't know what is going on with this place, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite hang out!  l love the draft selections and everything we've eating (salads, apps, pizzas, etc) has been great every time.  Love it."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good location. Nice staff, really took the time to find a beer that we'd like. Food was good.  Great beer selection. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Andy and Denise are amazing! My boyfriend Matthew and I visited Beer Head the day after it had opened. We are now regulars. The atmosphere is amazing! I have never felt so welcomed and comfortable."}
{"text":"6 of us went there before the Browns game to check out the east bank of the flats. We got there before the rush so one would think food and drinks would be easy to come by. Our first round came pretty quickly (highly recommend the sweet baby Jesus) but it stopped after that. For being there two hours we managed to get two drinks a piece, took over an out to get a stuffed pretzel and some dip and never got our sandwiches. We ended up canceling our food orders and settling for some overpriced stadium dogs. I truly think our server hated his job and didn't give two s&@\": about his tables. I only say this because the three tables around us came after us, got all their food and left. I'll give this place a chance again because I liked the atmosphere but the service was horrible!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. My friend and I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat on Memorial Day but it was anything but quick. It was the only place in the area serving food so you think they would be prepared. It took over an hour to get two salads- not worth the price. After an hour and half wait one beer and a salad should not be worth $22. I won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Their service is wonderful. Not only do they serve great food and give great pours, but when you're really drunk and you're like... Hey... I need water. Like a lot of it. And they give you a fish tank size pitcher full of water. It's good shit. Get the pretzels tho... Theyzzzzzzzz yummy"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing as there is so much to see and you can watch people walking by. They have outdoor fire pits as well. The menu is interesting to say the least. There are literally two pages for food and about thirty pages of beers, wines and other alcohol so if you are looking for a big food menu then this is not the place for you. The pizza is so amazing you cannot go wrong! Order the Goodfella pizza as it is so tasty!"}
{"text":"Great pretzel, pizza and beer!  Can't go wrong!  Lost Craft Tangerine wheat beer from CA was outstanding, highly recommend!  Pizza and pretzel were delicious, not a bad thing to say!"}
{"text":"Ordered the five cheese pizza here and it was delicious!! The outside eating area is beautiful with a cool fire pit and a gorgeous view of downtown. Will definitely be eating/drinking here again!!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Beerhead. Whether you are going to watch the Cavs in the playoffs, meeting some friends for a beer after work or going for food, it doesn't disappoint. The atmosphere is casual, and the food is delicious. I split a BBQ chicken pizza with a friend the last time I went there, and holy cow, it was amazing. (I'm getting hungry just thinking about it right now - and I just ate lunch). Beerhead is a great staple in the reinvented Flats."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. The Heirloom Pie was absolutely fantastic and I think the crust on the pizza is fantastic! What a great place to grab a seat on the patio and enjoy the views and people watch. The beer list is extensive in both drafts and bottles- just what Clevelanders crave!"}
{"text":"The pretzels are amazing and the pizza is good and there is a huge selection of drinks. I really love coming here. I'm excited for it to warm up enough to be able to sit outside at one of the fire pits."}
{"text":"Great beer; horrible food.  Breath-taking beer selection.  Multiple choices of every kind of beer imaginable.  The draft selection is constantly changing and the bartenders are very knowledgable.  The food was very disappointing.  The \"angry carne\" was tasty but came out less than a minute after we ordered it and it was ice cold.   The pizza was very doughie with tasteless sauce and almost no toppings.  Go for the beer, don't bother with the food."}
{"text":"Huge beer list.  The only thing that drives me nuts about this place is its open seating.  You are forced to hovercraft over people, waiting for an open bar stool or table.  The really bad part is you sit down to a dirty table and it may take a while for the busser to clear off the table.  Enough of the annoyances...Pizza was pretty darn good and more than enough for 2 hungry people to share.  Service was good once we got settled, and we were there on a busy Saturday night.  A good place to go for a few pops or before a concert at Jacobs Pavilion.  I imagine it would be a good place to watch a game."}
{"text":"I was a die hard World of Beer fan and when they closed by friends and I were on the hunt for another location to served up as many crafts beers as we could find. I am happy to say I think we have found it. With 50 taps and over 400 bottled beers this rivals world of beer only topping with with there selection of delicious food.  My friends and I ordered a pizza and pretzel...WARNING the pretzel is huge! I've never seen one that big, pretzel I mean. It was definitely enough to feed 4. The spinach pizza we ordered was also pretty stellar.  Our waitress was funny and bubbly and helped me fall in love with my magical new beer heaven.   While I have nothing but good thing to say about the Beerhead itself the reason I had to shy away from that fifth star is the cost to visit this wonderful place. There is very little street parking so a stop at this Bar and Eatery will cost you somewhere between $8-15 for parking.  I would suggest a carpool trip with some of your best buds to cut the parking cost and my motto is always the more the merrier when it comes to toasting with some exotic beers."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza that I've had in a very long time. My only problem is that I'm not a big fan of the seat yourself situation that they have. I wish they had attendants to seat you that would be much better and convenient for everyone."}
{"text":"Tall girl with side buns and a tattoo on her neck sucks. We were there on Easter and she watched us stare at the menu for 15 minutes and waited till we bought a drink till she told us they didn't have pizza cuz the \"pizza machine broke.\" First, what is a pizza machine? Second, thanks for handing us the menu and not telling us up front. Literally the dumbest."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Went by recently and my wife and I saw several people eating pizza on the patio. It looked really good and we decided to come back first chance. After a night of drinking on July 4th a pizza was just what we needed, so we ordered The Godfather pizza. The pizza was pretty good and frankly just what we needed today, but not quite up to our high expectations. The service was really good and sitting on the patio near the doors so we could see the several TV's was nice. They have a good list of draft beers to choose from and a HUGE list of bottled beers. Could definitely find some new brews to try here. We will give it another try this summer."}
{"text":"If you're like me (well, to be more specific, if you live in or around Cleveland), you are probably used to two things when you go out: a good selection of beer, and a plethora of pizza choices. Most pizza in Cleveland is on the thinner crust side. Sometimes, you want something with more of a doughy crust and you're too embarrassed to get it at Pizza Hut.  This is where Beerhead WINS in the pizza department! Cheesy, chewy, doughy pizza with a delicious assortment of toppings. I personally think their BBQ chicken pizza is the best, but I haven't been disappointed by any of them.  Beerhead is also amazing for their humongous list of craft, domestic and imported beers, all organized in a really nice menu giving you info on the style, location and name of the brewery, ABV, etc. I've discovered so many great new beers here and they rotate their seasonals frequently.  Seating here CAN be limited, but there is a (dog friendly) patio. Long tables are meant to be shared with other guests, so don't walk in and immediately assume you won't find a seat.   Beerhead is the best part of the Flats, and my new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Beerhead is great. I love this place because I have been for brunch, dinner, & a late night snack and overall always had a good experience. The hot pretzel is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. Not only is it delicious but I love the presentation and ridiculousness of its size. There pizza is extremely good. The only okay food item I've had was the breakfast croissant sandwich. The croissant was burnt and the \"piece\" of egg that was on it was about 2 bites. BUT the bottomless bloody mary's & mimosas made up for the bad brunch sandwich so I wasn't too upset over it. My friend got the breakfast pizza which was delicious so I had a piece of that also..."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Beerhead Bar & Eatery for an after-dinner drink. The beer selection is extensive, service was attentive and friendly, and the overall ambiance was high-energy without being too crowded."}
{"text":"Obviously this place is all about the beer.  The beer menu is actually a bit overwhelming, but it's a lot of fun to peruse and try new things.  The servers and bartenders all have to attend a really rigorous training about beer, so don't be afraid to ask them questions!  The food that they have is good - I just wish they had a bigger selection.  The pizza is really good - great to share or order and have leftovers for (at least) another meal.  The pretzel is delicious, but HUGE.  It's possible to eat between just two people, but you probably won't want anything else after that.  Worth getting at least once though.  As for the sandwiches... :(  I eat seafood but no other meat, and there are NO sandwiches I can eat - not even a fried fish sandwich, and not even on Fridays during lent.  So if I could make one request/recommendation to the management, it would be to add some seafood and vegetarian sandwiches or entrees.  This place is definitely a lot of fun and worth checking out if you haven't been.  Consider coming on Tuesday nights when they have trivia at 7pm."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night and it was overall a good experience.  Our server was extremely friendly, giving us different beer samples because we couldn't decide on what to order.  There was a huge selection of beer and food. My friend and I both ordered the Christmas Ale with cinnamon sugar on the rim with a goodfella pizza and we LOVED IT. The pizzas are definitely large enough for two/three people to share.   There was also live music which made the experience even better.  I plan on revisiting Beerhead Bar & Eatery very soon!"}
{"text":"we had a party of 7 and had a great experience here! Tierra was an amazing server! I got the pomegranate Moscow mule which was delicious and while the bar was VERY busy, Tierra was super attentive and had a great personality! we never had empty drinks and our bar drinks came quickly!"}
{"text":"Great bar!  Great atmosphere and of course great beer selection.  50 beers on tap!  I love how they organized their bottled beer by country.  The Bleu cheese potato salad was awesome!  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The beer list is excellent, and the pizza and giant pretzel look delicious though I have not actually ordered food here.  My issue is with the layout and service.  There are too many tables, making it difficult to move around the place, and uncomfortable to spend a lot of time there.  When I was there last Saturday (well before the dinner rush), we sat for 20 minutes with no service.  We were looking forward to trying a specific beer on the menu (which we had to get ourselves), but if we couldn't even place an order in 20 minutes, we did not want to know how long it would take to get our drinks and then pay our bill.  We ended up walking out, but I doubt the staff even noticed."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. I like the open air model to this place. Plenty of bread too choose from if you are into that. This use to be a heavy industrial area but in the last few years has become redeveloped.  Nice area and this place adds to the variety of restraints. I can't say much for the food but I would come again."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar got treated  like I was bothering them them, trust me, @ the time they were not busy. What's up with that style of serivce?"}
{"text":"I'm at this place and it's amazing Sean and Jason are amazing. The pretzel and Rosenberg were amazing. Helped put a positive end on a terrible day."}
{"text":"Great food!  Even my hubby, the carnivore, thought the Heirloom pizza was amazing.  He went for the Goodfellas and it was a great alternative.  We ended up splitting our bounty.  Truly one pizza is enough for two people.  However, we chose to save the leftovers for after the game.  The beer selection was awesome.  We didn't even bother with the cocktail menu.  The severs are friendly but if give yourself extra time for the kitchen and bartender to keep up.  However, it's totally worth the wait when you have time."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious but the service just takes that down a notch. Very under staffed, extremely long wait time to get our food but even longer wait time to find my server to get my check. Great pizza but not worth it unless they hire some more people to manage he crowd."}
{"text":"Beer head is a nice place. There are few EY people here which is always a plus. Some of the waiters/waitresses really know their stuff. Some don't."}
{"text":"Was at beerheads Saturday night with my family Nick m was our server and what a great server he was Nick is very knowledgeable of all your draft and bottle beer he is friendly and has a great attitude way to go Nick you made our family Get together fantastic. Oh yes and the pizza and pretzels are also great."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas, bloody's, and rose! If you're getting at least two drinks, might as well go bottomless! They open at 11am on Saturday and don't take reservations so you just have to get there and hope there's room for you!  If you're new to the area there's a lot of places around here you can hop around to and try, this is a good one to put on the list. I hear it's really busy on game days!  All of the food we had was pretty good. The portions were just enough, you don't get heaping piles of potatoes and that's perfect, less waste!  The Hangover Sammie was really yummy! The breakfast pizza looked amazing and I should've tried it. All of their pizzas look amazing (if you like chewy crust!) The breakfast burrito was standard, but good. The bacon maple donut holes were warm and sweet and very good, it's a good size so plenty to share and taste!  Bloodys use the zig zag mix which is always a winner and watershed vodka! (Shoutout Columbus!)"}
{"text":"I waited a really long time for not only a beer but a menu.... I also notice that the people next to me told the bartender that he was bad at his job and left. Maybe they were short staffed or maybe he was having a bad day? Who knows, but this was not a good first impression. :c"}
{"text":"Granted I was here on a very busy day (during a festival) but I'd give it a C. Tables were not cleaned quickly after people left, we sat for a while before we were approached by a waiter and given menus. The drink I ordered sounded magnificent, but was not well proportioned, food was mediocre at best and service could definitely have been improved. I'd like to come back and give it another shot when it's more well-situated."}
{"text":"My friends and I scored an awesome patio table on a gorgeous summer Saturday afternoon.  This was a great spot to people watch and take in the new build up in the Flats.  Loved the long list of beers and the incredibly tasty Heirloom Pie: Kale pesto sauce, heirloom baby tomatoes, ricotta, red onion, and balsamic glaze. Parking is across the street and we paid $10.  The area became quite busy when we were leaving around 6:30."}
{"text":"We went after game 7 of the east conference finals and they only had one type of beer...like literally that's all they were serving. I'm not from Cleveland so this may be a thing, or it could have been due to the game. I can't necessarily give them a fair rating but I'd def be open to returning with a full menu."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Aloft. We arrived very late (1030 pm) and we were starving.  We headed to the warehouse district to find something to eat. What we found was craziness! Some pub crawl was going on! We turned around and headed back towards the hotel.  As we headed down the hill we saw Beerhead across the street. So glad we did! The place was quite busy but we managed to find a spot at a table. There was live music which was good. Service was great, staff friendly and helpful. We had pizza which was delicious! We tried a local beer... masthead which was very good. We'll be back next time we are in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Upgraded after thinking about it . Pizza was really good, pear salad was amazing, and beer selection was incredible. Kitchen was really really slow. 2 hours to get meal. Mgmt was very nice afterward about it."}
{"text":"We love Andy! Super friendly, attentive & genuine!  Will definitely be back because of him!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars but my experience here was wonderful. My waitress Alicia was the sweetest, really knowledgeable about the menu and so attentive. The food and beer were amazing. Lots of beer options. Definitely would come back and get the Goodfella pizza. It's heavenly!"}
{"text":"Best bar in Cleveland as far as beer selection is concerned. The pizza is pretty good too. Love this place."}
{"text":"Solid bar food and nice beer selection.  I went with buddies on a Friday after work for some pizza, wings, and beer.   Very nicely done on those fronts - the pizza was hearty and had great quality ingredients.  It was adequately sauced and they absolutely nailed the crust in terms of texture and flavor.  We ended up ordering 2 more because it was so good, and because most of the guys in our group already have girlfriends so they don't care about getting fat.  Their wings were dry rub, and so tasty.  They kind of remind me of the Greenhouse Tavern wings, but normal sized, and more blue collar.  The staff promptly took care of us during our few hours there, and even struck up some friendly conversation as well.  This is exactly what you want in a pizza/wings place - great atmosphere, wide beer selection, and unpretentious bar food.    One small nit--the Bavarian pretzel.  It was too hard on the outside and the texture was all wrong.  It kept crumbling and falling apart, whereas an ideal soft pretzel has a pliable and robust surface crust - so that you can pull it apart without crumbling.  It's all about the texture when it comes to soft pretzels.  But damn, the accompanying cheese sauce made my knees weak and left my taste buds begging for more.   It would be nice if they had NBA TV. There are so many great teams to watch this year, and I'd love to make this the regular spot."}
{"text":"So glad to have more unique bars & restaurants added to East Bank of the Flats! Beerhead is a-ok. Great beer selections and their pizza is always served hot. Not a big fan of the seating arrangements or the decor/atmosphere on the inside and haven't had a chance to sit outside because of the crowds but their service is excellent. I'm excited to come back during the week when it's a little less crowded."}
{"text":"Great bar with a huge beer selection!  If you're hungry, they also have good food.  I ordered a pizza and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for brunch, and every time I've gone I haven't been disappointed. This is one of the few places in Cleveland that has bottomless mimosas (as well as a select few other drinks) for $14 when you purchase something off of their brunch menu. I have eaten something different off of their brunch menu every time I've gone, and every time it has been flavorful and delicious. The service is great, and it never takes very once you place your order. I highly recommend going here if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed excellent brunch and beer b4 the Browns game. Excellent brunch. Get the Avocado Toast. Johnny our server was Gr8!!!!"}
{"text":"This is your basic bro-frat style bar (but I don't mean that negatively, actually). We came here to watch some of the football games and a lot of people had the same idea. It was crazy busy! Despite that, the service was really great and somehow they found places for everyone. The selection of beers is vast, unsurprisingly. I did not eat, but a friend did and liked her her bbq sandwich a lot. I was hawk eyeing other tables' foods and it looked delicious too."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the food, Beerhead would get a much better review. The beer selection and ambiance is great, but I wouldn't expect a good meal.   I'd wanted to check this place out for a while and I finally went around dinner time on a Sunday. On first impression, I was amazed by their beer list - it was longer than most in Cleveland. The interior was also enjoyable - rustic with historic photos along the walls and a small stage for live music.  The restaurant is known for their pizza, but when we tried to order one around 4 p.m. on a Sunday, they were out of dough. So I got a sandwich, and it honestly tasted like cafeteria food that you might find at a high school or a hospital. By the time I was done with my sandwich, they had managed to replenish the dough, and from a distance, about 30% of the pizza appeared to be made up of crust.   I really hope this place can get their food menu together because it has great potential. I'd definitely recommend it for ambiance and beer selection, but I would advise patrons to visit another spot nearby for food."}
{"text":"The pizza is sublime.  Dopest pizza I've had in Cleveland area.  Pizza is also good. Pizza. Oh yeah hundreds of beers too. Also pizza is good."}
{"text":"I love beer. This joint was across from my hotel, Aloft, so I took a gander. Food was decent, but WAY over-priced. Let's just say, the two of us could have gotten a nice seafood dinner next door for the price of this sub-par food. The flights of beer were $22 a piece!! I travel often and get flights often.. I've NEVER seen this. The waiter said he took two beers off (one TASTER was $7) and it still came out to over $80. Anyway, nice people, but don't go.. not worth the $$. P.S. They drown the pretzels in butter!"}
{"text":"Having an amazing time at beerhead the fire pit outside is very cool tonight.  They have really good bartenders and a great selection of beers.  Pizza and pretzel sticks were really good too"}
{"text":"The flatts are totally up and coming and I have been on a mission to try all the new spots down there.  This was one of my last ones to try.  I met up with an old friend for dinner last night, we took a spot at the bar and were immediately pleasantly greeted by two different bartenders.  They asked us if we have been there, which we have not so they gave us the run down.  It is very similar to a World of Beer about 50 drafts that continually rotate as they only order a keg of each and 4 pages worth of bottled beers.  The bartenders totally know what they're talking about too and were extremely helpful when making selections.   The inside was smaller than expected but it felt hip and fresh.  It will be a nice spot in the summer when they can open up all garage door walls to a patio.    My friend and I decided we want to split an app and a pizza.  We asked the server which dip was better between a buffalo chicken type and a spinach artichoke type; he said buffalo chicken so that's what we went with.  The flavor was super good but the crustinis they serve it with are hard to bite and messy at times.  We again asked what pizza they recommend and he gave us the most popular items and we decided on The Californian with artichokes, mushrooms and spinach with a red sauce.  It was good, just not great.  Cooked well, toppings fresh just an overwhelming amount of cheese (which I am not a fan of) and a little bit of a doughy, fluffy dough.  I later learned the owners used to own a lot of Panini's and I can almost 100% guarantee it is the same dough they use.  Which I am not the biggest fan of Panini's but if you are you are going to die for this place.    As my food review is not the greatest, the service is impeccable, and it is a great spot to sit at the bar and watch a Cleveland sporting event.  You can see a TV from almost every table and know your glass will never be empty.    I definitely suggest you give a shot!"}
{"text":"For a new place this is great!  They have 15 pages of craft beer, beer cocktails and excellent food though that menu is small!!! The atmosphere is very casual cool and the service is great. We have a party of seven and our server, Tierra, is perfect. Attentive enough without being too much and for the kick off of Cleveland Beer week that says a lot. She is very sweet, happy and always smiling. Also the food was cooked to perfection!  We had the Queen and European pizzas that were to die for. The wings were delicious as were the 2 sandwiches the other two got. It is seat yourself which is also very nice since we had 7. And the check in for beer week was quick and simple!  Great job and keep up the good work. Don't let this slip and you will be around for a long time!"}
{"text":"I love this place, especially for late night. The pizza is OUTSTANDING. I love the Goodfella. You can also make your own, but they have a lot of great options. The beer list is humongous! There's a good 6-8 pages filled with them but my all time favorite is one of their mixed beers- the chocolate covered raspberry. It is composed of framboise (20%) and the rest is a yummy stout. IT IS DIVINE. You can purchase half growlers to take home :)   The atmosphere is decent for what the joint is and they have a nice patio. I approve!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time and felt very disrespected. I sat down at the bar with two friends and we were never acknowledged by any of the bartenders. We were ready to order pizza and beers but the vibe given off from the staff was something close to \"please leave so we can too.\" If you're looking for a casual place for pizza and beer in The Flats, don't stop here."}
{"text":"I had a very upsetting encounter here, the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I went with my coworkers while I was on call for the hospital as well so I only wanted to be there for a short time to get some food.  I sat down and ordered around 8:45 pm. At about 9:30 my friend asked if our food was coming out. I had to step out for a minute to make a call. When I came back  5 minutes later, I asked my friend if the waiter has said anything. He had not, so I stopped the waiter again. He said, the order is coming out soon. At about 10, I stopped the waiter and asked again, telling him I needed to leave and I would take it to go if it was coming out soon. I also asked to get the check so that I could leave right away with the food. At 10:15, again I stopped our waiter and at this point I was getting very frustrated. He went to the back near the kitchen where he stood for 10 minutes chatting with a coworker.  At close to 10:30 he comes back with the take out box finally, but I was so frustrated at this point I told him I don't want this food, I'm so upset I can't eat it, and to give me a refund. I placed my credit card on the table. The waiter just continued to say things like, well I don't make the food, there was a long wait for everyone. I said, people have come, eaten, and left in the time it took to get my food, and I asked you multiple times if my food was coming out and I would have left a long time ago if you had told me honestly that the food hadn't been made yet. He continued to just stand there and stare at me. I was incredulous, but I was so mad I could not stand there anymore. I took my credit card and was about to walk out. My friend stopped me and told me to give him the credit card to get the refund so I gave it to him and walked out. Outside the restaurant a few minutes later, my friend gave my credit card back back to me and said that the waiter said he would take care of the refund.  I have not gotten a refund. Seriously. I should have contacted management but I didn't check my credit card bill until the next month and figured it was too late. I understand that this is the shitty service of one waiter, who probably doesn't even work there anymore, but it was so horrible I would never go back there. This happened months ago and I still fume every time I think about it."}
{"text":"Headed down to the East Bank for Flat out Fridays.  Since the weather was nice, all the restaurants had long wait times.  We stopped into Beerhead and put our name in and was told it was a 40 minute wait.  We were seated within 20 minutes.  Although the outdoor patio was filled, we did get to sit close to the open overhead doors but the indoor dining areas are a little cramp.  If your looking for beer, this is the place.  Multiple choices on tap and many selections for bottled beers.  No matter what your taste is, there will be a beer for you.  It's a must to start of with the huge Barbarian pretzel to share at your table.  We could tell it is a popular choice because it didn't take long for it to arrive at our table shortly after placing the order.  There is a good selection of sandwiches and pizzas.  I chose the Angry Carne Sammie and was not disappointed although the side of Dixie slaw was pretty skimpy.  We also had some pizza too.  This is a fun and casual place to enjoy a bite to eat along with an incredible selection of beer."}
{"text":"Had a great evening at Beerhead!  Great food, cold drinks and the most engaging and attractive staff in the Flats!  Definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a low key place to hang after a Cavs game.  Ask for Keegan ; )"}
{"text":"We stopped here before a yelp event to grab a beer. It was a Thursday and around 6:45pm so it wasn't too crowded. We found seats at a bar top outside and enjoyed a beer near some corn hole boards we played! We didn't eat but the pizza smelled DELICIOUS! I will update after I've come here for food, I need to try that pizza! So far it is a cool place to come grab a beer from their EXTENSIVE beer menu and enjoy the view and fun atmosphere of the flats at a decent time before it gets crazy later!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Beerhead Bar and Eatery while visiting the section of Cleveland by the name of Flats East Bank which is dotted with a great variety of eating and drinking establishments all within walking distance.  It was our second stop of the night and my husband and I were getting a bit hungry; this place although not a sit down for dinner kind of place it truly lived to its motto, \"Drink Good Beer, Eat Good Food, Live Happy.\"  Besides having an impressive selection of beer on tap and bottled, their menu looked very interesting offering casual foods such as appetizers, pizza, salads and sandwiches.  After getting our beer selection out of the way, Imperial Stout from Great Lakes Brewery, we ordered \"Angry Carne\" and \"Diavolo Pizza\" both very tasty and generous plates!  The Angry Carne from the appetizer section were huge moist super tasty meatballs surrounded by toasted bread slices to scoop up the amazing red sauce.  Yumm, Yumm, Good!!!  The pizza was also hot and crisp with an amazing sauce and spicy chorizo pieces; another great choice!!  These two dishes were satisfying, and we did not need anything else for the rest of the night!! If you are ever in this side of Cleveland do not overlook Beerhead Bar and Eatery;  it is true to its motto as can be!!!"}
{"text":"A true staple of the Flats East Bank, Beerhead is far and above the best spot down here. Cassandra is one of the elite bartenders in the tri-state area, tied only with Pat from little bar. Tip: get the bbq chicken pizza, add mushroom."}
{"text":"Decent place location wise but many of the beers on their menu seem to be out of stock. Service is just ok, sometimes it takes 15 minutes to be told that the beer that you ordered is out of stock."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this place. We went on a Sunday around 1:30PM and it wasn't too busy. We were seated immediately so that was good. The service was very slow. We sat for a long time without our waitress checking on us after we had gotten our food/drinks. We were ready to pay and she continually walked by (5 times I counted), didn't look at us or come to our table. Yes, I tried to get her attention. We got another waitress' attention asking for her to send our waitress over, but she was rude and did nothing (does anyone know good customer service skills?)?so that was very disappointing since we were done and waited around for forever to pay.   Also, their pizza is awful. It's comparable to gas station pizza. I wouldn't recommend ordering it, unless you get a special one I guess. We just got a simple pepperoni and sausage - but it was not good. Very very doughy and minimal amount of cheese."}
{"text":"So what's the nutshell on this place? Expensive, extensive beer list. Limited bar-esque menu. Loud. Good service. The biggest soft pretzel in Cleveland.  Want more? Read on.  Holy $8 beers, Batman. I've never seen such an overpriced draught list in the Cleveland area. OK, maybe at Oak Barrel in Valley View, but this is pretty near the top. I get it, supply and demand, right? You've got a limited amount of something so you don't want to sell it. That must be it. Don't get me wrong, the beer list in this place is of monstrous proportions. 50 taps, what seems like an endless list of bottles and cans (stick with the latter if you're looking for beers closer to $5). It's basically what the World of Beer does, too (RIP Lakewood). I was surprised when one of the bartenders came over to me after about two minutes and asked me if I knew what I wanted. I'm only on chapter 3, man! Another thing, kudos to them for the detail and organization of the beer list. I've harped on places before for not having enough info. These guys err on the opposite side of that fence. Well done.  As for the food, there's not much of a menu here, either. It's your basic pizza/sandwiches kind of place, good for munching along with a few pints (and when I say pint I mean 12 oz). I see that others have mentioned that the grub's on the expensive side. I didn't think so. About $10 for a sandwich, $13 for a pizza that easily feeds 2. Nothing out of the ordinary. There are even a few desserts for about $7 each, although we didn't get around to trying those.  It was a Saturday evening. Sometime around 5:30pm. Pretty damn cold out, so the crowds were not all that big. We walked in and there wasn't anyone to greet us. We kind of wandered around for a bit before taking a seat. We sat at the bar and our bartender was excellent. She was very pleasant, quite attentive and kept on top of our empty glasses, always ready with a recommendation or simply to ask how we were doing. It was also very, very loud, even with a relatively small crowd. Be prepared to shout or sit in silence.   Now for the food.  NOTE: Sandwiches are served with your choice of potato salad, chips or slaw.  The Harvest Salad ($11.95): A mixture of fresh romaine and spring mix, halved baby heirloom  tomatoes, crispy bacon and goat cheese tossed in an espresso vinaigrette. What the? Isn't a vinaigrette supposed to have vinegar in it? It's even in the name. This salad was an oil slick on a plate. No acid at all. I was too annoyed to even ask for a lemon  The Pulled Pig Sandwich ($9.95): Nice, soft roll and the slaw added a sweetness that complimented what little sauce they had managed to put on the pulled pork. Yeah, pretty dry. The real star was the potato salad. Filled with fork-tender taters, creamy creamy dressing with smoky bacon pieces. They should sell tubs of this stuff.  4-Hour Ale Braised Bratwurst ($9.95): I'm not sure you really need that long to cook a brat, but this was a tasty dish. I really liked the caramelized onion jam and beer mustard aioli and the baguette was toasted perfectly. But the chips I received as a side were sad, pulverized pieces of potato. They looked like they came out of a bag and not the house fryer.  So, in summary, Beerhead is a great joint if you're looking to expand your beer palate and grab a quick bite. The beer list is well-curated, features a great combination of rare finds and a healthy dose of local brews, and will leave your wallet feeling like it got kicked in the nuts. If you can overlook some minor missteps on the food menu execution and you've got plenty of disposable income, this is your place."}
{"text":"Let me say this, if you are thinking to go somewhere for lunch, this is not the place to do so.  We got at our table at 12.20. I had a plane leaving at 4 so one hour 20 minutes, should have been sufficient. We waited about 20 minutes to place the order for the drinks. 15 minutes later the waitress came with only one drink and completely forgot what the others ordered. She took our appetizer order (wings) and we also placed out sandwich orders. (Pulled pork). At this time it was almost 1:10. The food finally showed up at  1:56. And yet no appetizer (the wings). finally I had to leave as it was already really late. By 2:15 the waitress still said that the appetizer is coming. The food was nothing more then \"restaurant depo pre maid stuff\" I guess the place is known for pizza and beer so I can't really bitch about pulled pork. In any case, the service sucked and the was plan at its best. To a good note the beer many was huge so that was something to look for."}
{"text":"Banana. Bread. Beer.   You heard that right.   I said banana bread goddamn beer.   It makes dreams come true and angels come down from heaven to play the harp in your ear as you sip (or chug- I don't judge) this drink of deliciousness and rainbows.   Magic I tell ya.   Service sucks if you want food. You'll probably wait an hour, but it's worth it. Everything I've tried is really good, like the soft pretzel the size of your face, or the pizzas.   Huggggggeeee selection of beer. The options are limitless."}
{"text":"Lunch review-  came to CLE for Cavs game and came across this place. The service was just amazing. It was to the point that my 13year old son even said \" dad the service here is really good\" . The server bvllshitted with us... told what was good on the menu ... and everything he suggested was amazing  . Pizza -good , Pretzel - massive and good!!!  My kids and wife loved the place- it wasn't packed - and massive beer selection.... massive..."}
{"text":"Great food.  Service not so great. I called for take out and no luck.  I even called directory service.  I went in and asked about take out as the phone didn't seem to be working.  All I got was \"we have been slammed\". Ironic given the place was half full."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and it was pretty good. I got a breakfast pizza which was huge and full of flavor. The brunch menu doesn't have a lot of selections, I was hoping for just bacon and eggs. I also enjoyed a coffee drink with bourbon and pecan syrup, it was super strong and I'm still confused where the pecan syrup was but it was good. We also tried the donut bites which were delicious. Lastly we had the angry carne Sammie from the lunch menu, it was good but just a basic meatball sub. The side of potato salad that came with the Sammie was really good. Our waiter was super helpful and nice. My only complaint is my friend ordered an iced coffee cocktail which was much too strong and just not very good. Our waiter even said he has never seen someone finish it. I just don't understand why have it on the menu if it isn't good. Over all I recommend this place if you're looking for a strong sunday funday."}
{"text":"The pizza was raw.    They sent it back and it came back out burnt.... and still raw. Absolutely disgusting.  Beer was well passed it's freshness date because they have so many beers.  Nice try flats, but you'll fall apart again if you continue to house places like this."}
{"text":"Amazing drink selection! Had these beer cocktails were they mix different draft beers together and it was so delicious. We didn't try the food but I definitely want to come back it looks really good!"}
{"text":"We love Beerhead for lunch or dinner - decided we would try them for Saturday morning brunch.....it was AWFUL. My husband and I both got the avocado toast and added egg to it. It came back as 4 small pieces of toast with some type of \"avocado smear\" and cold egg particles. The amount of scrambled eggs on one plate would not even add up to 1 full egg at home. We were also charged an extra $3 for the egg particles. Very disappointed, and I wish we would have refused to eat it. Going home to make more food because it feels like we ate nothing."}
{"text":"3rd time here, awesome place. Was here 9/4/16  The Good: -Beer, Beer, and more beer, all start at $5 and go up, which for a $5 craft beer, thats not horrible -Food, it is very good, especially pizza -Cool Atmosphere, summer is obviously better, they open the whole place up, lots of areas to sit -Service, service was good, slightly slower than expected when busy, but not horrible  The Bad: -All 3 times I have noticed the food takes a long time to come out, We waited close to an 1 hr for our food.  Granted we had 10 people, and the place was busy, would have been nice just to have been updated on the status of the food.   -Again, service was slightly slower when it was a busy afternoon, not nothing major -No reservations, first come first serve, in the summer its no big deal, but in the winter you are jam packed inside waiting  Id give this 3.7/5 after being here a few times, will continue to go.  Hopefully Beerhead reads these and can make adjustments when time allows."}
{"text":"I'm a bit iffy on this place. Lets just say, If the general manager were to serve us everytime we came, then I'd come here all the time. I came here with my girlfriend for the first time on my birthday. The service was probably the worst I have ever had anywhere I've eaten. It took the waitress twenty minutes to tell me the drink I ordered was all out. Yeah, that bad.   Naturally, my girlfriend called and spoke with the GM and we returned upon his request. He himself served us and I couldn't have asked for a better experience.   We came back again, a bit late and a tall male server with dark hair was beyond rude to us and told us the kitchen was closed. Understandable if the kitchen was closed, but the way were spoken to, I'm caught in between a rock and a hard place. Doing my best at making my rounds at every restaurant on east bank but this one just seems to go either way depending on the night."}
{"text":"Went here recently before a concert so it was crowded and service was a little slow. However, I still had a great experience. We ended up sitting by the bar instead of waiting for a table. Since it was just the two of us, it worked out perfectly.  The waitress was attentive and checked in on us a few times despite being obviously busy with several customers.  A manager also came by to make sure we were ok so perhaps they are aware that service has been an issue in the past.  Didn't try the beer so I can't comment on that. I did enjoy their mac n cheese bites and the farmers pizza.  The mac n cheese bites feel a little less gourmet and more comfort. Reminded me of a cheesy tater tot with ooey gooey cheese - almost like a melted Kraft mac n cheese bite. I think it had some different cheese in it, but it felt more like cheddar than anything else.  The pizza was amazing! I appreciate the variety of veggies (kale, peppers, and more!).  The ricotta was creamy and was a nice contrast to the cheese in the appetizer.  I love that the crust is more soft than crispy although not everyone will enjoy that. They had a couple good vegetarian options for pizza so I can't wait to go back.  I've also heard that the soft pretzel is delicious and good if you're with a larger group.  Since this part of the Flats is the place to be these days, I'd recommend off hours to avoid crowds or make sure you're prepared to wait."}
{"text":"we had a GREAT time here and the food is pretty freaken good too!!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer joint.  New and shiny but cool place.. Parking is expensive in the area, but the good beer knowledge of the staff made me forget all about that.  Definitely worth checking out... Pretty much any beer style you can desire- they have something close for you.  Over 100 in bottle and on tap."}
{"text":"This place was my second favorite pizza joint in the city (Dewey's being first) BUT this place has a wider menu selection including some amazing giant pretzels.   Located in the heart of flats, I often came here for dinner before wandering the streets of Cleveland.   This place can get packed on game days so beware, but that shouldn't stop you!  Extensive beer menu which can be a bit overwhelming but servers were super helpful in that regard and had no problems with bringing samples (trust me, my friends and I tried several before making up our minds).   Also, they have live bands that perform here which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"I aspire to have as long as hair as our bartender (he's a guy). Good atmosphere, tryin to come back to try to try that avocado bread. Comin back soon"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and I must say I enjoyed this place! You can pay $10 (cash only) for parking in the lot right in front or you if you're lucky you can find some meter parking on the street. They have some patio seating outside, but it was too cold for that. Inside we sat at a high top table and enjoyed a couple beers and a nice late lunch. I got this pulled pork sandwich on a warm and soft ciabatta roll. It also came with blue cheese potato salad and a leafy green salad. Pretty tasty! Our waitress was nice and helpful with bringing me samples of beers I wasn't sure about. I'd definitely check this place out again! They have plenty of TV's if you want to watch a game and the place seemed lively even at 3:30 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Too many other options down here to wait 45 minutes for waffles. Waiter did his best to keep us informed -- this was Sunday brunch. Really angry...."}
{"text":"The service at Beerhead is bad. So bad. So so so bad. Possibly the worst in Cleveland, maybe even the entire state.  Here's how my experience at Beerhead went. There's no hostess, so we find an empty table and ask the first server we see (who is standing right next to us at the computer) if we can sit there. He doesn't look up and just gives us a terse \"yes\". That's fine... He's in the middle of placing an order. So we sit down... 5 minutes pass and no one gives us a menu or takes a drink order. No problem, they're kind of busy. 10 minutes, still no menus. Ok, we can wait. 15 minutes, still nothing. Did I mention that we're sitting next to the computer? At least 5 servers and what appeared to be 2 managers have seen us sitting here at this point. 20 minutes later, we finally ask the manager for menus. He drops them on our tables and as he's scuttling away, we ask if someone will take our orders. His response, \"I'll try to find someone, but no one is assigned to this table.\" Then he disappears. Huh, you'll TRY to get us a server... That's great. Is this guy serious? So we leave and find another place where they don't have to TRY so hard.  On the plus side there are at least 5 other restaurants on the block. I recommend Crop Rocks instead."}
{"text":"Fun, clean place with a huge selection of beers, both bottled and draft. Visited during a day of boozing in Cleveland and ended up staying for a few hours. Didn't eat anything so all I can say is friendly staff, nice crowd and vibe, and huge selection of beer, they definitely live up their name. They have little fire pits going outside when it gets chilly so that's nice too."}
{"text":"First time here. Great beer selection and bartenders were cool. Also, great lovers spat in bar spiced up the evening."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with an amazing selection of beer, this place hands down gets 5 stars. On the other hand if you are looking for good food to go along with it, you'll find yourself quite limited. The pretzel isn't bad but the pizza I found to be too doughy. If you go here, grab a few beers and sit outside for the great view and atmosphere. For food, you may want to venture somewhere else."}
{"text":"A good beer menu, really good pizza, the people is very friendly, only thing they should serve the beer a little bit more cold."}
{"text":"Decent bottle list. Extensive, but nothing too impressive. Did not eat, but the food looked good."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a beer with friends. I stopped in on a Friday evening around 6:30pm with a group of 6 and were seated right away. We were grabbing drinks before dinner. We each were able to find a drink on the extensive beer list and ordered a giant pretzel. The pretzel was delicious and we were all able to have a decent portion! The pretzel came with a cheese dip and a mustard dip... both were great!   I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"GREAT beer selection, GREAT pizza....... However..... Terrible customer service. The bartender just walked by us and burped like he was in a frat house or something. Not appetizing.  They pretty much ignore you and you have to ask if you want something. It's terrible.  With the history of businesses not doing so great down in the Flats, one might think that they'd make sure their staff would go the extra mile. After meeting the manager I can see why the bar is set so low.  Literally no customer service skills. Sad......"}
{"text":"Huge variety, 20+ pages of beer options, and I had a tart lychee and lambic sampling size -- both beers were delicious. Hard to narrow it down when there's so many options, but that's the fun of the place. Great view of the bridge/Flats, as well."}
{"text":"So far, I've been here twice. Once for dinner, once for drinks. Overall, I think it's a pretty solid bar with better-than-average bar food. Atmosphere is exciting and loud, with occasional live band.   PROS -Get the pretzel. I'm not a huge fan of soft pretzels, they are usually too salty, no soft enough, or in general, just not tasty. I can tell you that this was none of those things. It was delicious and enormous. Just look at the picture - I stuck the steak knife in it so you could see just how big it was in comparison.  -Beer list. They have a pretty extensive on-tap list. When I wasn't sure what I wanted, they let me sample a few that were in my consideration set. Check.  CONS -Seating availability. We walked in here on a Saturday night and it was pretty packed. When I asked if there were any tables available, a waiter did a quick peer around the room and said no. When I asked if we could put our names in for the next available table, they said that there wasn't a list, we would just have to wait and watch for tables to become available. We got lucky and found a table, but I think they will lose a lot of customers with this approach.  BOTTOM LINE -Go here if you want a good brew and some snacks to go with it. Good for small groups (under 6), but good luck snagging a table!"}
{"text":"Really cool craft beer bar, 50 taps & awesome pizza. Cooler full of craft beer bottles, and a friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Management- Please fix this place!  This is a potential gold mine.  Such an incredible vibe, beautiful views, in a most fun City, but this restaurant is a mess.  It's a week before Halloween and the place was completely out of ALL Fall beers.  Not One!  The menu was not updated.  The digital draft list was also not correct.  We had four different servers and each had to refer to someone else to know what beers were available.  Seriously I LOVE THIS PLACE but am craving better service!  Please, please, put a management team into operations.  Also, when you're out of the first 10 beers we ask for, and your server offers a replacement, advise the servers to announce that the 'replacement' beer is $15.  Not ok! BTW- please keep the yogurt Buffalo wing dip on your menu, forever."}
{"text":"This place has many beers on tap for whatever preference you prefer. Also have bottle beers for things that are not on tap. This place is really nice for chill day. Also you can sit outside and sit by the fire pit on a colder day/night to warm you up. Prolly will be coming back to try out the food next time."}
{"text":"Beerhead is pretty solid.   Holy Batman beer menu. Its so good it's almost unbelievable. Their drink menu is honestly so many pages that my friend had to point out that I missed like 5 of them. I would absolutely bring my beer snob friends back here for happy hour in the future.   We stopped by during the week for a drink, and I was so surprised how chaotic it was. This is awesome for them but a little stressful for me. It was already a hot day, and with the open-air patio open, and sooo many people inside, it was kind of uncomfortably hot. We also ordered a burger, which was fine. Their strong suit here is really their beer and the cool ambience of the Flats, and that's OK.   Also, when we entered, we were unaware you seat yourself. We awkwardly stood at the hostess stand for what felt like eternity, as other wait staff and patrons just stared at us. If there was a sign to seat yourself, it wasn't visible. If you saw me at Beerhead that night, I swear I'm not awkward. I'm looking forward to revisiting in the fall/winter when hopefully its less chaotic!"}
{"text":"Came here to have a beer before dinner and decided to stay and watch the entire Browns game.  We really liked the cool, laid back environment.  The beer list is extensive and we wound up ordering the goat cheese dip and a couple of pizzas.  The dip was very good.  The pizzas were quite tasty, albeit a little too fluffy and not thin enough for my taste, but that's just a personal preference.  The service was a bit slow, but it was quite busy and the server was very friendly.  Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the Cavs game and honestly, Dan was far and away the best serviceman I've ever had. Went so far above and beyond for our table and keeping us in the loop of what was going on in the kitchen (was a bit backed up due to being busy) and keeping our drinks full and honestly, just being awesome. Amazing atmosphere and vibe! Great Big cheese pizza as well. If you go here ASK FOR DAN!!!"}
{"text":"Played hookie from work and came here on MLK Day.  Only 2 other tables in the place.  More beer distributor types and manager milling around the bar than customers.  Food was good but expensive.  Had the wing app.  13 dollars for 8 little wings that look liked the one I got for .10 back in the day.  Good, but not worth 13 dollars.  Supposedly they are hormone free, etc?  I can give a rats ass.  The malts that make up the 13 beers I drank all weekend probably had hormones all over 'em.  Ill get over it.  The beers were even more overpriced than the food.  8.00 for an Andes mint tasting stout.  Good, but for 8.00 I need a reacharound with it.  The best part of lunch is when the \"Beer Guru\" (as she is stated on the website) started crying and coming in-and-out of the restaurant 20 times, letting in the friggin' cold air.  What topped it all off is when she left the last time she parked her SUV right in front on the place and came in for one last round of waterworks with guy drinking at the bar.  Classssssssssy..."}
{"text":"Overall: Very good beer selection with some inventive food.  Food: 4 stars.  They go beyond the normal bar food with unique appetizers, sandwiches, and pizzas.  The Barbarian Pretzel is their big seller, and it's very good with 2 dipping sauces.  Drinks: 5 stars.  The beer menu is the largest I've ever seen and is organized well by type.  They have a decent cocktail list too.  Prices: 3 stars.  It's on the higher end for bar food, such as $11-$15 per sandwich.  Pizza is a good size for $14.  Service: 4 stars.  The server did a good job explaining the menu and came by enough.  Interior/Atmosphere: 3 stars.  They have a lot of TVs in the main section.  They initially tried to seat us in the north section, and you really can't see any TVs from there, so they should add some.  Location: 4 stars.  A great corner location in the East Bank Flats but you'll likely need to pay for parking."}
{"text":"Cool place, loads of beer, friendly bartender - good food (I had a pizza)...  On a colder Wednesday winter evening in Cleveland I met a few friends here for a beer and some food to celebrate a friends birthday.  It worked out really well, because we were the only people in the place.  Service was prompt, food came out quickly and the gal behind the bar was super cool.  I imagine that these places are so new it is going to take some time for them to be discovered and I am sure the weekends are a little different than a Wednesday night.  I wish them success, while there are lots of places competing to get my discretionary beer money this place is will stay on my list."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of beer themed bars in the past year, but this one was the best yet! Amazing beer selection without a doubt and there had to be at least 500 different beers to try. But they also had a ton of different mixed drinks and the food was really really good. The place was packed when we went, but it still had really good service. This is by far my favorite place the new Flats has to offer."}
{"text":"Gotta throw some love to my boy Sean.... Okay, he's been my favorite bartender for all of 20 minutes but still.   My friend ordered a Hawaiian Sunshine from him- in case you don't know a Hawaiian Sunshine is a type of tropical plant not a drink sooooo anyway. My friend said make something that makes you think of it and he made a Hawaiian Sunshine and that was that.   I decided to test his bartending skills and told him to \"make a fun shot\" that wasn't whiskey or tequila. I asked if he wanted to test his skills and make a gin shot and he went for it. He also made me taste test them before I bought them. 10/10 best bartender ever.   Okay back to beerhead. They had live music so steal my heart. Happy hour looks great. Pizza smells amazing. Will update when I've tried both"}
{"text":"Was truly amazed at the beer selection at this place.  If you can't find a beer you like in this place you don't like beer.  Pizza was good.  I really liked the hot bread pretzel, which is super thick and the size of a dinner plate (2-3 people can share).  It came with cheese and mustard dipping sauces and paired perfect with my Brooklyn Lager."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad. Vast selection of beers, menu is small. Had decent dinner, some of the appetizers looked appealing but I didn't have one. Would try it again."}
{"text":"Beer is in their name, so I'd say anything else is just an added bonus here when giving it a review. There is no denying that this place has an extravagant beer list. It's huge and has to be at least 8+ pages listing and detailing all the beers available. They also have a decent amount of ciders (at least 10ish) for those who enjoy the cider game.   Staff is helpful in finding you a beer if you're a bit lost by the menu. In addition to having 5oz and full size glasses, they will let you sample some for free.  They're also known for their pizza, which is very good. The potato skins are a must try too!  Overall, it's a great place and my favorite in the Flats because of how chill the atmosphere is. Everything else down there is overly club scene whereas Beerhead is a no nonsense place to enjoy some food and beer."}
{"text":"Went here after Punch Bowl Social was a huge letdown.   Pizza rocks.  Get a jumbo pretzel.  Tons of good beer.  Nice location and attentive employees.   Thanks for a good time, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed our time here! So many different kind of beers on draft, and if they don't have it on draft, it's definitely available in a can or bottle! Service was great, always checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Music selection made for a good experience as well. Would definitely be back next time we're in the flats!"}
{"text":"A huge selection of drafts and bottles, and the staff was helpful and friendly! Prices were reasonable for the area."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink and app before dinner. The beer menu is HUGE and correctly laid out for your enjoyment. Some places they hand you a beer menu and they have it listed by brewery or what came in last... This place is none of those things.. They list by type of beer, so if your in the mood for a porter, go to the porter page, IPA, there is a page for that... Makes the experience that much nicer. Also the waitress was awesome and helped us with our beer choices after finding out our tastes. Also had the mac and cheese bites.. could of been cooked a bit longer but pretty solid... They look like mini mozzarella sticks, filled with mac and cheese goodness.. We will be back."}
{"text":"Stayed at a hotel down the street and was recommended to come here to Beerhead. WOW. Decided to come here both days I was in town. Food is on point and the local beer was top notch. I had the 4 hr ale braised bratwurst the first day and the short rib Sammie the second day. Highly recommend both. Awesome atmosphere and friendly service. I'll be back here next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Uncomfortable Truth #4- every bar in 2016 is awash in craft beer.  It's no longer a challenge to have a good beer list.  The big beer companies own microbreweries now, and distributors are sending craft beer to any bar that orders from them.    I like what's happened to the East Bank.  It's livable now.  It's a place where you can go.  I just wish there was more to go to.  Beerhead is the obligatory sports bar/fancy beer place.  It's marginal.  The waitstaff is OK.  The service isn't outstanding, and you'll be left wondering where they went.    The food is OK.  I had a pizza.  It was their meaty pizza.  I wanted the one that had the giardineria on it, but they ran out.  That's not cool, especially since that seemed like a staple ingredient on the menu.  It was every pizza I've ever had.  Nothing stood out.    Go here if you want beer and can't leave the East Bank.  Otherwise, check out other places."}
{"text":"Beerhead. A name that calls to all who love the yeasty, malty, hoppy drinkable gold. They boast a slew of draft beers and over 20 pages of beers in cans and bottles.... It was almost overwhelming. While I love the thought of this place, I think all the prices need to come down a dollar or so. I'm assuming the prices are higher because 1. It's in the flats and 2. The large inventory means less turnover of beers and kegs (also makes me check the best by dates when I get a bottle).  We were there at 5:30 before going to an Indians game and we're hoping for happy hour, but alas, no happy hour. I wanted to try a new beer because they had sooo many, but didn't want to pay $8 for a beer I might not enjoy. So I stuck with a beer I knew.  Our server was very friendly, but the service was a bit slower than we hoped. We were planning for it to take about an hour. There was only two of us. We each had one beer and split the huge delicious buttery pretzel.... we ended up being late to the game, which started at 7.  The patio is great- I like the vibe. What made me giggle is the amount of signage for Beerhead. It's everywhere, incase you forget where you are!   Moral of the story: Should have checked Yelp for their (lack of) happy hour first!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday and was surprised that the restaurant was not crowded at all. My friend and I got seated immediately and were promptly given water and menus.  I ended up ordering the avocado toast, and my friend ordered the hangover sammie. We both also got mimosas, which cost $14 for bottomless with a brunch item! I thought that the avocado toast was pretty tasty, but definitely not incredibly special and the portion size was actually pretty small in my opinion. I was definitely full by the end of the meal from the mimosas but I don't think the avocado toast alone would've filled me up. The toast itself is pretty thin and the avocado on top is just a thin layer as well. Nevertheless, the servers here are very attentive, and we had our mimosa glasses refilled promptly and frequently haha.   Overall, I think the bottomless mimosas here are worth it and I would probably come back again for that in the future. The food is not bad, but the portion sizes are definitely smaller than I would typically expect for a brunch entree. Customer service was great, and the location of the restaurant is also pretty scenic! If not for brunch, Beerhead also has a huge menu of beers that could be worth checking out if you're into beer :)"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, lots of beers, food looked good but didn't try it.  Came here on a whim when the line for punchbowl was wrapped around the building.  It was calm at first but then got super crowded after an hour or so.  Definitely will be back to try the food."}
{"text":"I love this joint. The flats are really making a come back. When you enter you pass by a cute little fire pit. super cozy and nice to cuddle up with some one special. The had garage door windows that open on nicer days. Neat touch. I usually park it at the bar. Overtime i have been in the staff is always warm and friendly, Also extremely knowlagable know about all the beer they carry. Pizza happens to be my favorite food. theres is so relish! I usually opt for the meat pie. sausage is great!!!!! all around get joint!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in Cleveland. Maybe the best pizza too. Very relaxed atmosphere. You can also get really any type of beer or cider here."}
{"text":"I live in the East Bank Flats area and frequent Beerhead.  They have a fantastic beer selection--around 50 beers on tap and 100s in bottles.  I love beer so this place is great for a few beers.  Food is alright. Small menu. Nothing amazing. Their pizzas are their strong suit in the food category. Very basic food menu though. Not the place to eat in the area.  Worst service in the area. I agree with a few reviewers in saying that the staff is poorly picked with inhospitable attitudes for a bar atmosphere. About half the time I come shortly after work (between 4 and 7), and their staff is seriously lacking and between those hours it takes about 5-10 minutes for anyone (servers, managers, owners?...[theyve never introduced themselves... Just blankly looked at me waiting to be served]) to acknowledge me in an empty bar. Unacceptable.  Andy and Nick (a manager), who I think both just work at nights, are great hospitable staff, but the rest have been slow, lacking competence, unfriendly and seemingly miserable working there.  3 stars because I'm huge advocate of having  customer service in the customer service industry and the food could be better.  Summary  1) Great beer selection--draft and bottles. Best overall selection in the area.  2) Small menu with mediocre food --Pizza best choice 3) Service miserably lacking. Expect long waits for service even when they are dead. 4) Owners/daytime managers need to greet/acknowledge guests. Not just deflect gaze when customers are looking for service with a \"it's not my job mentality\" 5) Look for Andy and Nick who are great staff.  Suggestions for the restaurant  -Find people who are interested in having a job to work for you or find less \"burdened\" people to work for you. -Work on your daytime staff. Very poor in general.  Suggestions for potential customers  -Great place for beer but for beer, food, AND excellent service, I suggest Flipside Burgers across the street."}
{"text":"$9.00 for a draft beer!!!! Holy crap I can get a 6 pack of quality beer for that. Some genius put a huge shelf at forehead level in the Men's room. I hit my head so hard I started bleeding. Otherwise nice place to stop in."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of beer and a prime location in the Flats but , if you are hungry, don't go there on a holiday.  The kitchen is too small or understaffed to handle crowds.  They seem to frequently get to the point where they stop taking food orders.  We waited an hour for our food which was good but not THAT good.  Our waitress was very friendly and professional and kept apologizing as did the manager.  I appreciate that and I suppose the problem is out of their hands but a recurring problem like this should be dealt with by either changing their menu selections, enlarging the kitchen, getting more ovens, increasing kitchen  staff, etc. and it should not take a year to do so."}
{"text":"Update: Every time we go to beerhead, we have a good experience! I went with a group that started as 3 of us, and ended up as a table of 9 or 10. Our server, Maria, was awesome and everyone in the group was happy. Our waters were always filled, everyone enjoyed her beer recommendations and no one was ever with an empty glass. Serving a table with constant guest additions can be tough, but Maria had no problem keeping up with everyone. Plus, the pizza is always delicious!   Beerhead is great! Their pizza is amazing, and they have unlimited quantities of beer. Having an outdoor patio is a plus, especially with the firepits in the cooler months. Every time I've gone, our server has not disappointed with a recommendation of beer, and you can also do flights or sample beers if you are unsure of what to get. Love coming here for drinks and a bite to eat on a casual night. Definitely an awesome addition to the flats!"}
{"text":"By far the best spot in the flats! All around great service, food options and atmosphere. Prices are fair, fun place to watch a game and hear some music."}
{"text":"Love this place. The Californian pizza is to die for. My husband likes thin crust and I like a doughier crust but we can both agree and both love their pizza. The edgewater salad is fabulous as well.   The beer is really the highlight along with the staff's beer knowledge. You will small beers here that will not find at any other place in cleveland. Have not had one beer that was not amazing and always have to stop before I get to try all of the beers that appeal to me each time I go in.   The staff are all very friendly. I can't think of even one thing I would change. It is wonderful and we will continue to go there!!"}
{"text":"Really, really good beer selection. Food is just ok, although I haven't tried their pizza which is evidently there speciality. Bonus points for them allowing dogs in their nice patio!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with my girlfriend. Ordered a round of beers. They have a huge selection like a binder of different crafts. Had the chicken blt and pulled pork sandwich too. Sat on patio. Had to pay 10$ for parking though. Not a bad night, cool spot."}
{"text":"Had the best service from Jill (bartender), but I would have given 5 stars but the kitchen was closed, when it's advertised to be open until 1am.    I manage two restaurants, and I understand closing things earlier, but 40 minutes before the advertised time is a bit ridiculous, since there are a substantial amount of people here.  The only reason I stayed is because Jill is very friendly and attentive in this sad hunger situation.    I also just wanted to suggest updating the online menu.  There are new food items and the prices are slightly higher than the website suggests."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere with a great beer selection! Great place to watch the game! and decently priced food."}
{"text":"So, SO many beer options, that I just end up getting liquor.  A tip here- they make really weak drinks, so if you're driving great, but otherwise, you're going to suck them down fast, and spend a lot more than you normally would.   The appetizers are pretty tasty from what I have had, and servers/bartenders are very nice.  They do a nice weekday trivia as well.  It isn't a bad stop to make while hanging out in the flats."}
{"text":"Fun people/boat watching on the patio, nice view of downtown, extensive beer menu, knowledgeable staff, and a huge a_s pretzel that feeds four. Only draw back for me was the menu seemed a little limited. But if I need to get off the boat and get a pretzel, I know where to come."}
{"text":"Dan (not Stan) was a fantastic waiter and very knowledgeable of the beer menu. He was very personable and made our experience awesome! We will definitely be back. Side note- if you're very brave, the pretzel can be tackled by two people."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4.5 in my book even though I know it has a few locations elsewhere. For beer selection alone, it's one of my favorite places in the city. The pizza is fantastic - besides beer, this is what I believe they're known for. Their dough is delicious... Also the giant pretzel... Again... Delicious dough. They have a great staff whom are all super helpful and friendly.  It's also prime location with a nice patio.  Our favorite is a diavolo pizza though we've had some each since we come with friends and eveyone orders different things. They're all good. Besides the pizza, we've gotten the aforementioned pretzle (YUM) and nachos (also yum).  Fun tip: They have happy hour on weekdays I think till 630 or 7, and a few pizzas are heavily discounted and most definitely worth ordering a pizza each so you have plenty of leftovers. The happy hour beer selection or discount isn't that great though but I don't mind that, since the pizza is such a good deal.   The only negative so far is on our last outing there, the dough looked like it hadn't risen properly. This looked to be the case at a few other tables so not sure if it was intentional or what. It's never been like that before."}
{"text":"Definitely not a Standout in The Micro Brew scene. Average food decent beer but wouldn't go out of my way to try"}
{"text":"Server was really nice and accommodating to my two year old who is pretty much a huge pain in restaurants at this point. We came during the day when it was not too busy. Very large beer selection which is cool. We ordered avocado toast and the large hot pretzel. Pretzel was yummy - could have been slightly softer and included extra cheese. Avocado tasted like it came out of a bag. Service was a little bit slow. Good location right across from the water. Would be nice to sit on patio at night."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a 2.5 stars but I can't. So I guess 3 will have to do...but too high. Pizza was ok...one came out underdone. Beers a little pricey for quality. Service was maybe 2 stars...not very good. I would not come all the way downtown just to eat or drink here."}
{"text":"Ready to drink around the world and select a beverage of your choice from an extensive selection?  Or maybe munching on some delicious food is more your thing, either way, it can all be done here. Feel free to walk, bike or park in the parking lot across the street.  The bartenders in depth knowledge of both their bottle and drafts helps make your decision easier if you are unsure of what you want, but I suggest drinking from another country because why not? Their pizza is deliciously cheesy and is perfect for that late night snack or any other time of the day.  The cute memorabilia relating to local breweries and Cleveland content being to life the restaurant. I love the local support and the diversity this brings to the Flats.  Helpful hint: the restrooms are in the back right and their is an ATM in the front of the restaurant in case you need cash! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. One of the top beer bars around. Always a great selection to please every taste. Food selection  is limited, but done very well. Stone oven pizzas are really solid.  Customer service by the bartenders has always been amazing. I usually stop in before Browns Home games , bartenders Sean &   Gabe Always greet me, remember what kind of beers I like and go out of their way to suggest a sample, and they always seem to hit a homer .  I truly appreciate the level of service to someone they see 7 or 8 Times a year.  Very impressed, and also why I try to stop in the other times I may be in the flats area. I feel the company as a whole has a great customer centric focus. I have stopped in another beerheads in Pittsburgh recently, and had other great service experiences for a place I have not been before. Bartenders are knowledgeable and passionate about beer, and it shows in their interactions."}
{"text":"Friendliest group of servers I've ever encountered - good food and great beer and Cassandra is a ray of light :):)"}
{"text":"Short answer: terrible service, great beer, so so food  We showed up and had to wait 20 minutes before some came over to us and then 15 minutes after that for drinks to show up. The people next to us had their food delivered and but had no plates or silverware. They waited about 5 minutes before getting up and getting their own silverware and plates. Then we had to wait 15 minutes for someone to come get the check that we had a card down for. We finally got up and went to the hostess stand to have it paid for. The server who's attention we got told us he couldn't ring us out because the system would not let him, it had to be the server who opened the tab.  If that wasn't enough here is the real sad/frustrating part. When our server first came over to us finally after a long time, she said, \"Sorry for the wait, we had a girl who didn't show up today so I guess I'll get your table for you\". We were blown away at the statement. This is not something you bring to the attention of customers and make them feel bad because this waitress will take their table out of the pity of her soul. This is something the manager and staff  take care of, split up the uncovered tables at the beginning of the day and just handle. That is a terrible thing to pass on to customers like that.  The icing on the cake was once paid, we asked to speak with the manager. We explained the situation to him and he agreed that we should not have been told about that and \"it was not our problem\" and was wrong to say something like that. But then goes on to apologize and ask the server's name and said \"She's on loan, so we didn't know she would say that\". The manager threw his own staff under the bus and did the same thing he said that the waitress should not have.   Unbelievable. I give two stars only for the beer and patio environment. However myself and the rest of my party could not get over the gross mishandling of customer service at this establishment and will certainly not be back to support this business and its bad management and service."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, beer is great, and they play Pearl Jam! From one 10C member to another, keep on rockin' in the free world!"}
{"text":"Worst possible experience.  The host was a space cadet said our table would be ready in a few minutes.   Check back with her after a few minutes and she had no recollection of speaking with me and said it was a 45m wait.   She's a brunette pure dumbass"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really like Beer Head. Great drink selection and pizza. They have been out of quite a few beers though each time we have been there and service is typically slow. We almost left after waiting about ten minutes for our waitress to get our drink order. Hopefully service improves cause otherwise we like coming here!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really excellent. We weren't there long, but I liked the atmosphere and music. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in the Flats. The beer list is always amazing and do yourself a favor and order the pretzel -- it's enormous and delicious!!  I enjoy the patio on a nice day, but the communal indoor space is welcoming, as well. They also happen to offer bottomless wine, mimosas or bloody Mary's during brunch which is a dangerous and fantastic idea. The brunch pizza is tasty and enough for at least 2 people!   Our service has always been great, which can be hard to come by in the Flats. That alone makes this place worth returning to or checking out."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday after work, not crowded at all, service was very fast.   Bartender was super nice and knowledgeable.   Lots of beer selections on tap, Ohio beers were $1 off for happy hour.   Will be back, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and a TON of beer choices. Our server was very nice and personable. Atmosphere was really good as well."}
{"text":"Waste of time. 40 minute appetizer times. Over 90 minutes for a pizza. Are you kidding me? There were 4 our 5 empty tables so it wasn't crippling busy. The server quickly blamed the kitchen but our empty glasses were barely recognized. Just a complete waste of money. I recommend avoiding this establishment in the Flats. Hopefully it will be replaced with something better in the future."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for beers after my group had enough of the noise at Punch Bowl. This place is your typical sports pub atmosphere, but is pretty laid back. The beer list is incredible. They also feature several beers that are collaborations between different breweries. The beer list was almost intimidating, but the bartenders did a great job with personalizing suggestions for my picky self. I didn't get to try the food, but I walked by a giant soft pretzel on my way to the bar and was drooling."}
{"text":"They have a HUGE selection of beer it's practically the whole menu, so if that's what you're looking for definitely go! Really nice outdoor seating and the food was good. We just got a regular pizza and it was a perfect light pizza. Good for if you're going to be downtown walking around the flats and don't want to be too full to walk. My only concern was the service. The waitress was super nice but took a while in between stops back at the table. We were waiting 10-15 minutes between refills and for the check to come. Overall really good though"}
{"text":"My friend and I were left to figure out how the place works on our own. No host or staff greeted us at the door or stopped to say hi when we were stood looking around in the entry way. We ultimately figured out that all seats, including dining tables, at least at the time we went, were first come first serve. We grabbed a high top table and shared it with three other groups of people.   A waiter, with no personality, finally made his way over to us to take our orders. Service was slow.   When the pizza did come out though, it was good. I ordered the Diavolo which had chorizo on it and really spicy peppers. I would go back for pizza, and perhaps at a less busier time to enjoy the nice patio."}
{"text":"Came here to catch the end of a Cavs playoff game last weekend with my girlfriend. Place was lively, outdoor patio looked nice too. We sat at one of the open seating tables right in front of a TV. Server was kinda slow getting our stuff, but it was pretty packed. The one time I was there before, last year, we had excellent service from a very friendly bartender (whose name I unfortunately do not remember). Anyway, we had a few beers and the largest pretzel I've ever seen. Delicious!   Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the experience."}
{"text":"Nice beer list, need more servers. Terribly slow service. Almost went stalking my server after, 3 out of 4 of our party had a drink, and the fourth waited 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Sweeping beer selection covering many styles.  Heavy in American craft Beer selections.   Fifty Taps rotating.  Ordered the Chilli and was very good.  Bratwurst braised was Excellent.  Bar staff was working at their pleasure.  Prices a bit High."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and the place was packed by 9 pm. Tried the Boulder Shakes. I had the orange one with the chocolate beer. Delicious!  Pizzas was so fresh with light fluffy crusts. Sandwiches looked good. The salted pretzel was huge and five of us shared it. Service was very good. Great place for a group of friends, or by oneself. On the East Bank."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is classy but yet edgy in a good way, it shows respect to our local Cleveland breweries. If you're a craft beer fan this is the place to be! Hands down, it's the greatest Beer bar around! Relax take your time here, the beer menu is so extremely large it's almost hard to choose a beer. I've only ate here once and I had the pretzel which is a appetizer and it was fantastic, it's huge! I was here with Family and they all ordered pizza and I must say it looked amazing as well. This place is a must visit no questions asked! If you're into craft Beer you will be 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza I have eaten in cleveland. We got the farmers market pizza and it was absolutely divine!! Really friendly staff too. Highly recommend and not terrible prices!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch of pizza and salad. Both were okay and reasonably priced.  The pizza reminded me of a Pizza Hut pan pizza which is on the greasy side.  At lunch time they offer a personal size pizza that comes with a side.  I upgraded to a spinach salad.    The weekday lunch service was very good, getting us out quickly.  I saw that patio seating was available which warrants another visit on a warmer day.  Would try something else off the menu next time for sure."}
{"text":"Hostess was rude, forgot I said outdoor seating then when I corrected her and asked to sit at the open table outside she rolled her eyes and said \"ok you'll just bump someone\"... uh what? You messed up...I'm not bumping any one.  Waitress was rude, waved her hand in our faces multiple times to ask if we're ready for our order. She forgot things, wasn't pleasant. Perhaps overwhelmed by the crowd?  The salads are so small. See my hand is half the size of the salad. Tastes good but so small."}
{"text":"I went here with my brother after the Cavs parade and we left feeling totally disappointed. As another reviewer pointed out, yes, it was a busy day downtown but this place wasn't as packed compared to other restaurants in the area.  The server staff worked their butts off trying to keep the place clean, I appreciated that. However, when it came time to order we couldn't find a waitress, so we eventually flagged one down. Then we placed an order for a pizza... an hour later we asked, \"Where's our pizza?\" and the server looked totally confused.. I could tell they didn't remember our order. We wanted to leave at this point but they already charged us for the pizza that never came. So we waiting again.. 10 minutes went by and it appears that they gave us the next pizza that came out of the oven, except it was COLD!   Then, the people sitting next to us were wondering if we were eating THEIR pizza because their order was apparently never processed. At this point my brother and I were completely fed up, we ate quickly, paid our bill and left without looking back.  What a disappointment! Now, I will say there were a couple nice people on their staff and they also have an amazing beer selection. But the service was terrible and the food was just okay, nothing spectacular. I would never come here on a busy day (Browns/Cavs game) because you're just going to get screwed."}
