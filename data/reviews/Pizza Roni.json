{"text":"horrible pizza horrible service  no wonder prices are low
cheese is bad quality,  bacon wasn't even bacon but ham , sausage was frozen and wasn't fresh , do not recommend and service is even worse than the pizza"}
{"text":"Good and cheap. Delivery  is quick. Good option for poker night with the boys. Not the best pizza but good dough ; fluffy"}
{"text":"It's a good option if on a tight budget.

The slices are a bit small but always fresh.
The pepperoni is really lifeless as is the cheese.

2 slices and a can of pop for 5 bucks is 2 bucks less than in other places.

It is a hole in the wall, it's a delivery type of place. My suggestion would be to grab a box or two and head for a parc nearby or better yet head for the river a block away."}

{"text":"It looks like a whole in the wall, when you order a pizza the staff is rude but it all worth it, this is the best pizza in mtl. The prices are great and the pizza is amazing. You all should pick up pizza from this place."}
