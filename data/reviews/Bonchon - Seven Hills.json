{"text":"I've been to 8 different BonChon Chicken restaurants throughout the country. This is by far the best. I don't care how long I have to wait, better than driving to Columbus or DC to get this chicken. Trust me it is worth it. 

I don't normally write reviews, but it is needed. These other reviewers are absolutely ridiculous. Yes, I am calling you out. Why don't you open your own restaurant and see how hard it is to get everything right in the first 2 months of opening.  Whiny bitches."}
{"text":"Overpriced Overcooked Overly dry chicken....I make this at home the secret is breading with cornstarch and not flour. One person thinks the patio view of a shopping center parking lot loaded with the cars of T.J. Maxx shoppers across the street is nice. Gotta love Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Wow wow and wow 

I have tried many different kinds of Wings. You know bdubs rooster(when I was in columbus) wingking lizards kfc papa johns pizza hut. Well, wings are all same? No, you can't beat bonchon wings and not only Wings but also their drumsticks which is huge and huge strips with half and half sauce (soy garlic and spicy) will blow you away

Bonchon Seven Hills definitely has the world class chicken and surprisingly, it is located in Seven hills I think it s very odd location for this trendy restaurant but for me it's just 15 minutes to get here so i can't complain 

I travel all over the world and USA and I have very picky taste. My wife can't satisfy me most of time and also many restaurant 

I highly recommend chicken wings and strips I usually order 3 spicy and 7 soy strips because th air spicy is no joke and Bulgogi buldak would be another world class dishes here.

don't afraid to try this amazing Korean restaurant they have not only good food but also good atmosphere with nice surrounded music"}
{"text":"This is a cool franchise and the food is great.  I wish they had a few more sauces for the chicken but everything is fresh and really good

Need a kids menu but I was glad they did not ha s one because my kids tried different food"}
{"text":"If you like chicken - this is the place for you. Stop what you are doing, and head over to Bonchon in Seven Hills, just down the street from Swensons. 

Bonchon's soy garlic chicken is amazing! Like truly delicious. Crispy and delightful on the outside and perfectly tender meat on the inside. 

Only thing you need to be aware of is the size of the chicken you order. I mistakenly ordered the large order of drums thinking they would be chicken wing sized drums, and then had to get 4 to go boxes in order to take all the full size chicken legs home with me. 

Wings = normal sized chicken wings/drumettes
Drums = full size chicken drum

The fries are great if you want a side with your chicken. Also, the spicy chicken is less spicy when cold, which is the only way I could eat them."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying that I lived in Korea for 13 months, and Korean food if probably my favorite out of any country I have been to. I finally got around to trying this place today (a Sunday) It was around 2pm and there were only a handful of tables seated. I was solo, so I sat at the bar. I felt the service was just about right, checking in at the right times without being excessive. All of the staff members I encountered were polite and friendly. I had an order of the chicken strips with the soy garlic sauce. Nice crispy breading, and the chicken was tender. I would give them 5/5 for the chicken alone. On the side I had white rice and Kimchi. The rice was done right, a little sticky just like I remember in Korea. The Kimchi was great, and the most authentic I've ever had in the U.S. I will definitely be back to try some of their more traditional menu items."}
{"text":"Beutiful building Awesome japchee and wings are super! Big parking lot with valet parking service!"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if it was an option. This is a new restaurant and we have been here 4 times. Unfortunately we have only been able to eat once. The first time they said they weren't doing carry out, the second they said the kitchen was too backed up to take new tables, the third we ate and the food was pretty good. We got the chicken tenders 1/2 and 1/2. Tonight we sat for 45 minutes to then have someone come over to tell us that they didn't put our order in and it would be a longer wait. We had tickets to a show so could not wait so they gave us our bill for the two beers we had. They couldn't even comp the beers."}
{"text":"You can read the other reviews for an explanation about the amazing chicken, but what blew us away was the Pot Stickers and popcorn chicken. Just incredible! Ron was an amazing server and it's good to see Joe running the place.
Above and beyond everything else is the decor. This is one of the nicest sports bars around. Phenomenal patio, 'garage' doors to open up the place and TVs everywhere. (I swear you can see the one giant TV from Acme!) They've done an amazing job. So glad we have a new spot in Seven Hills!"}
{"text":"My friend invited me to dine with her at Bonchon, Sevenhills on Sunday evening.  I didn't expect much since I know that it is franchised restaurant.  The decoration is trendy and relaxed.  We ordered combo small bonchon chicken with half (spicy)/half (soy garlic), pork bun and bonchon salad.
Our server was friendly and helpful to help us.  The service was quick and we got split plate for sharing food without asking which was nice.  He always make sure that our water is filled. 
Bonchon salad came and it was fresh and nice.  The sesame ginger dressing was going well with the mixture of romaine lettuce, tossed with edamame beans, scallions, thin strips of kimchi and sweet potato strips, fried chicken.  The portion is big and we really enjoyed it.  Pork bun came together with Bonchon chicken.  Pork bun dough was nice ( the dough is not starchy but having nice texture), the pork is well marinated.  Bonchon chicken was crispy juicy but delicious (I tried spicy one).  Overall, the food was delicious and service was good .  It was pricey meal but I think it worth to try."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try and did not disappoint. Great service and delicious food. Nice comfortable ambiance inside! Will be back to try more offered on the menu. Happy tummy right now... ordered tacos and wings. On point."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite place. Compared to buffalo wild wing, the quality of Bonchon chicken is way better. It is crispy and delicious sause. 
Also, I like the interior of this restaurant (clean restroom, nice bar and so on). I really recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"DONT GO HERE!!!!   Rip off, if you like over cooked wings and undercooked fries, I have a place for you. Wings are no bigger than anywhere else, even though they are about $3 more for 10 (not even a dozen). They taste like overcooked wings, like they were left in the fryer 4-5 minutes too long. Went with the spicy, which weren't spicy. Then ordered the $7 seasoned fries that were the size of a medium fry anywhere else. Supposed to come with parmesan cheese and spicy mayo, but they must have forgotten how to make their own food, since that was missing. All that, and the price is outrageous for what you get. Will not be back, and will tell everyone to not go here.  Please don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this as it was new and we like flavorful food. My DH got a small chicken combo with the soy garlic sauce. He enjoyed them, he thought the sauce could have had more soy and more garlic flavor. He was looking forward to the kimchee coleslaw, but they were out of that. Probably a result of growing pains. We got the regular kimchee instead, which he said was quite spicy. 

I had the bulgogi main dish. The meat was tender and the mushrooms and onions cooked well. The veggies and rice were a little plain and undercooked for my taste. I also thought it was overpriced at $16.95 for a portion the size of a standard Chinese take-out container. 

I ordered the seasoned fries as well, which were a little cold by the time I got home, but I saved them and will heat them up later. I was looking forward to the spicy mayo and they forgot to give it to me, so disappointed there too.

I will give it another try, hopefully they will work out the grand opening jitters and have a long and prosperous future here."}
{"text":"it wasn't bad, but I thought it was pretty pricey for average food. Our waiter was very friendly, but I just don't think it's worth going back on our limited budget."}
{"text":"Discovered a new place that will become one of my regulars!! Ordered the chicken wings, in both sauces (spicy and soy garlic) which were very tasty!! The Dduk boki (spicy rice cake) was good with the right amount of kick! Bulgogi sliders were good and the bibimbop was delicious!! Loved the casual, bar-like atmosphere with good music and several flat screen TVs. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We had a friend tell us their chicken was like crack. I don't smoke crack but I could see the chicken has an addictive quality. Very tasty. Good list of microbrews too. Tasty apps like shumai. A lot of fried influence on the menu but you've gotta indulge once in awhile. We'll be back if in the area again (without the kids, they're too picky to eat here)."}
{"text":"We've been patiently waiting for Bonchon to open, especially since we haven't had Korean fried chicken since we moved away from Hawaii 8 years ago. We're happy we waited. Bonchon is very easy to find on the east side of Broadview Road in Seven Hills just south of Pleasant Valley Road. This is the first week they are open, and they are serving a limited menu at the moment with expectation of serving everything next week. Our family of five arrived at about 7:45 pm and waited only about five minutes for a table. The dining room is fairly spacious and there were many staff on hand. 

Our waitress was named Rachel and she did a good job of introducing herself and the new restaurant and it's offerings, We ordered a bowl of edamame to start and also ordered chicken wings and drums, fried rice with seafood, pork dumplings, chicken katsu, and bibimbap with bulgogi. Also a side of the fermented radishes.

Our drinks came out quickly as did the edamame. The only real eyebrow we raised during the meal was at the small bowl of plainly salted boiled edamame. Having lived in a place where these are ubiquitous paying two dollars for a bag of frozen edamame in the supermarket is jarring; paying almost $7 for 1/3 of that amount is almost a shock to the system. They were tasty, though.

Our food came out fairly quickly and it was all delicious. The Korean fried chicken was perfect, hot and crispy outside, steamy and juicy inside with a soy garlic sauce and very very good. The fermented radishes were a perfect side, a cold crispy vegetable with a sweet and sour pickling that was refreshing and  palate cleansing. The pot stickers came with the same soy-garlic sauce, very well executed and delicious. The fried rice was similarly delicious, it came with options of plain, with bulgogi, and seafood. We tried the seafood option and it was excellent.

My oldest daughter ordered chicken katsu. She tried to order it without the mayonnaise sauce but we were told there were no deviations allowed from the order description in the menu. (The menu states \"In order to maintain the taste and quality of our product, our sauces are not available on the side\"). That feels a little \"very\" to me; if you are an \"on the side\" person you may want to keep that in mind. Nonetheless, she enjoyed the dish; I suspect she would have enjoyed it more with tonkatsu sauce on the side like we used to get at Zippy's in Hawaii.

I ordered the bibimbap. It was served in a very hot stoneware bowl, a nice traditional touch that allows for the rice on the bottom to be cooked to a delicious crispy layer, a delicacy known as nurungji (Burnt Rice)...it really makes the dish special and authentic. The bibimbap was made with fresh seasonal vegetables, in this case there were asparagus, spinach, carrot and squash as well as a yellow pickled daikon. With additional bulgogi and the standard egg cracked into the center this dish was delicious, well executed and filling. If you order this be aware the bowl and the food are very hot; the food was actually a little difficult to eat when brought to table because of the temperature; for sure touching the bowl would cause minor burns to bare skin.

Including drinks, the above dishes plus tip of about 18% came to just less than $100 for a family of five. Moderately expensive but to us worth it for the memories of eating these same foods across the ocean. Good to very good service in a busy place, lots of TVs showing sports and the cooking channel, good food and portions. Bonchon Seven Hills has a Facebook page, Bonchon has a website (and many locations in the US and abroad) and can be reached at 216-236-6969 to place carry out orders. The address is 7581 Broadview Road in Seven Hills. Bonchon is open 11 am to 11 pm Sunday - Thursday and 11 am to 2:30  am Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Very few korean fried chicken spots in this area, so major props to Bonchon opening up a restaurant in Northeast Ohio! Modern interior design, set up very much like a sports bar (9 TV screens and counting). Great for group settings.

I recommend ordering the Chicken wings and chicken drumsticks combination, with Half&Half for the sauce (Half Soy-garlic, Half Spicy). You'll be able to try a little bit of everything with this combo. Mathematically (let's be real - everything related to chicken wings often comes down to the math), I think the Spicy Drumstick gives you the optimal surface area flavor to volume ratio per bite. The meat in the drumstick is particularly juicy and tender, however less so in the wings. 
Don't forget to get the cole slaw or the radish in between bites - it's a nice palate cleanser/neutralizer to all of the saucy flavors. 

Overall, happy to have a Bonchon in the area for a KFC (Korean, not Kentucky) fix. I think it's a bit on the pricier end for the food, but if you are seeking a refreshing flavor change on your classic chicken wing - check out Bonchon!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm not ever going back. First off where I was seated (right by the giant glass garage doors) was freezing I had to eat with my winter jacket on...Let alone the other tables in same area everyone who wasn't drinking alcohol had their winter coat on. When it's below freezing(7°) the temp in the restaurant should be raised;especially when you have an industrial decor with metal seats and tables. And when we mentioned to the hostess that we were freezing during our meal making our experience unenjoyable she laughed in are faces and rolled her eyes like a rude immature child. Great front staff you have... The food was way overpriced for what we got. The only thing I'd ever reccomend would be the chicken wings. Everything else we got was mediocre for the over pricing of the food even the wings were nothing special for the price.When my food was brought out to me it wasn't even hot!!? Maybe Im crazy but when I'm paying $14 for an entree I expect it to be hot when arriving to my table. And I'm sure the wings would've been cold but since they ,\"ran out\" of wings in the back that's prob the only reason why they were fresh. I'm sorry but I'm upset that this place was such a disappointment. Maybe if there was a manger around it would have been a better experience. So far this is just a fad restaurant we'll see if it lasts."}
{"text":"I normally place a to go order and I haven't had any issues and I've always received fresh food. I love all of their wings, but I've also had the Chicken Katsu and their Bon Chon Wrap. The Chicken Katsu was good, but I wish there was more sauce and the Bon Chon wrap was really yummy."}
{"text":"Review updated after second visit, old one below:

Thank you Bonchon, you've redeemed yourself.  Trip #2 was what I hoped for the first time through.  Perfectly fried chicken with well sauced shatteringly crisp coating and tender inside.  A spicy chicken that slaps you in the face without being too hot that it's not fun.  A surprisingly good Korean taco and those crispy octopus balls.  Tasty popcorn chicken.  The service was slow and didn't get the food out with any urgency and the udon soup tasted a little like it came out of a package buuuut it did have nice toppings.  TV screens everywhere- a good place to watch the game.  Valet parking, what?  In Seven Hills?  That's when you know you're really hopping.  Bonchon, I just can't quit you.  Welcome to CLE! 

-=- old review -=-

Soooo... yeah, I'm a little torn.  So much promise here, but the execution was wanting.  From the very first time that I drove by the empty storefront where the legendary name, Bonchon was displayed prominently, I was struck with a sense of eager anticipation...  a real Bonchon, of Korean Fried Chicken fame opening up here in Cleveland?  And in the quaint suburb of Seven Hills of all places?  Immediately I found their Facebook page and \"liked\" it, and waited, and waited and waited.  Until earlier this week, when I happened to see that there were already a couple Yelp reviews posted!  So I had to come out to see what I thought.  

For those who aren't familiar with Korean Fried Chicken, they are twice fried chicken pieces coated with a flavorful sauce- in the case of Bonchon, Soy Garlic and Spicy.  They are made to order, and so take some time to get ready for you.  This is not a fast food place. 

I called 35 minutes beforehand for a pick up order.  The girl I spoke to initially couldn't hear me in the loud restaurant, so I was handed off to someone else, a male voice.  He took my order, one medium combo (wings/drumsticks) split 50/50 in flavors and an order of bulgogi sliders.  Told me to be there in 25 minutes or so.

When I pulled into the parking lot- which was fairly large, it was almost completely full.  This place was hopping.  Decor was hip/industrial.  To my surprise, the almost everyone in the place was Caucasian, including the waitstaff!  I thought that mainly Asians were going to be there at first until the word got out, but I was wrong.  I told the hostess that I was picking up food, but she had a look on her face like she was confused.  Turns out that no one entered my order in.  I had a hungry toddler at home, but she told me that she could put the order in and it would be ready in 15 minutes.  My wife told me to go ahead and get it- I was already there.

15 minutes or so later, the girl handed me a bag.  \"You already paid, right?\" she said.  Actually, I had not paid, though if I was less honest, I totally could have said, \"sure\" and walked out.  I wondered if they would comp me a little for completely forgetting about my order, when she had the paper sitting right there in her hand.  But they didn't.  I paid for everything and went home.

So how was it?  It was good, but not amazing.  Good things- the coating was crisp and for the most part flavorful.  The spicy version packed some real authentic heat.  Drumsticks were a fair sized.  The bulgogi sliders were interesting.  It would have been better if I had eaten them fresh from the kitchen instead of driving them 10 minutes home.

What was lacking?  The chicken was overcooked and the meat not as flavorful as the places that I've had in NYC.  (does it need to be brined more?  Is it even brined?) Chicken was unevenly sauced.  The slider rolls were not stale, but felt like it was getting close to it.  Wings were a little scrawny.

Honestly, if I wasn't bullish on this place, I'd give it a three for the messed up pick up without any real apology and the somewhat underwhelming chicken.  I'm adding one because its the first Korean Fried Chicken in the area and its dangerously close to my house.  Will check it out again, in person, with friends and see how it does the second time around- then I'll revise my review.  Good luck Bonchon- I hope CLE falls in love with you.  I know that you can do better."}
{"text":"I have been here three times the last couple months, so a review is probably warranted. If nothing else, I was intrigued by a more approachable take on Korean food(at least for a white dude raised in Parma). Don't misunderstand, I am fairly well traveled, but Asian cusine is still confusing to me, even after some on location dining(does a piece of chicken on a stick count? I usually opt for something like that when roaming a foreign land).

So, the food - in short, I find it pretty darn good. The korean tacos w spicy chicken are a fave, along with the spicy wings. The spice here is fairly hot, but it seemed a bit more mild on the last trip. One thing I'm on the fence about is the dry wing deal... I prefer a wet sauce, but they are still tasty. We have also had the pot stickers, steamed buns, calamari, fried octopus balls(forget the name), shumai and probably some other things. I have to say most everything was good for my palate.

Place is not cheap; for two of us we usually spend at least $60, although I usually down a couple beers which jacks the bill. Speaking of that, they have a decent beer list(if small)and full bar."}
{"text":"I want to recommend this place.

The menu provides a nice spin on the typical sports bar bites -- yes there's chicken wings, chicken fingers and various sliders but all have a Korean flair to them. There are also other appetizers to nibble on while watching all the big-screen TVs on the upper halves of the walls as well as more traditional Korean dishes.

But I can't recommend Bonchon after our first stop there. The service was extremely slow -- how can a sports bar make money if the patrons have to flag down a server to get more drinks? I mean isn't getting people to stay and drink the chief business model of a place like this? There was also quite a wait for our main courses and an even longer wait for one of our fellow diners, in particular.

Looking back at our experience early Sunday evening, I can't recall seeing anyone that looked like a manager on the floor (an extra pair of eyes keeping tabs on the diners' progress) so maybe that was an issue. That, and maybe since this place is still pretty new they are still getting into a flow with things.

But we will give Bonchon another try because the food was solid, and quite intriguing. Our fellow diners ordered the Salmon Avocado Ball ($9.95) and the fried calamari ($13.95) and let Jeannene and I taste them. When you got a forkful of the ball, it tasted like sushi and the salmon had an interesting light, flaky texture. The calamari was a large order and I could imagine filling up on those heavily breaded rings while watching a Cavs game. We got the fried shrimp shumai ($6.95) which were small, soft dumplings with a light sauce drizzled over it.

There was more to come but you get the point that this place offers not-your-usual nibbles for a sports bar. Hopefully, after a couple more weeks, they will have gotten their service straightened out."}
{"text":"I really like the decor of this restaurant but it isn't what I would expect for a Korean restaurant. The bathroom is also clean and one stall has a personal light switch if you prefer to go without overhead lighting. 
My dad and I split a few dishes. We got the famous wings half spicy and half soy garlic. We both like spicy foods but the spicy wings were a bit to spicy (not stomach ache level) - the soy garlic sauce was tasty and helped decrease the intensity of the spicy sauce. The wings were crispy and had a good amount of meat. 
The bulgogi was very good and sweet, the meat was tender and I enjoyed the vegetables it came with. 
We also split the Japchae (noodles) which we both thoroughly enjoyed. The noodles were done perfectly and the sauce was tasty. There was a good amount of vegetables and meat with the noodles. 
Lastly, we had an order of the house fried rice with chicken. I think I enjoyed the friend rice more than my dad. There was a lot of chicken and it had Annie taste overall. 
Bonchon is a good restaurant with a nice beer selection. The food was tasty but is pricey which is what might keep us away considering other cheaper options that have equally quality food."}
{"text":"**BEST** fried chicken in Cleveland!!! 

1st: The chicken is all white meat & fantastic! We got 20 strips for 4 people (Half Soy Garlic - Amazing, sweet, tangy & Half Spicy - In my opinion, the spicy is HOT) I got nosey and peaked into the kitchen and saw kitchen staff slicing fresh chicken meat for the strips so know that you're getting fresh and never frozen chicken. The breading was light and unlike 99% of Asian places I've been to the fried chicken was mostly chicken. Not a glob of breading. Definitely the centerpiece of the meal. 

2nd: Salmon Avocado Ball. Unreal, light, airy, and different from anything I've had. I hear this requires some skill to build, so our waitress was kind to let us know this would take the most time to come out. 

3rd: Fried Rice. We had the Seafood & Chicken fried rices. Both were steaming hot and fantastic. My only wish is they would have brought this out with the chicken instead of separate. 

4th: Bulgogi Korean Tacos: Very good. If Barrio had these on their menu, I would order them every single time. 

5th: Seasoned Fries: Second best French Fries I've ever had never to Wing Stop. TRY THESE!

6th: It doesn't have the sports bar vibe, but it is an incredible place to watch a game. You can see the massive TV's from the street and they have a huge screen above the booths. 

7th: Rotating craft beer list. $2.75 domestic beer bottles. Pretty affordable bar. 

I really liked this place. The service can be at times slow, but all that matters to me is that the meal is superlative and the food here is great! Will be back! 

5 out of 5 stars!"}

He was great.  The decorum was amazing love the modern style. Food and service great I recommend. I will be returning"}
{"text":"Met here on Sunday for lunch. I was to one other Bonchon, in Rockville MD, and I loved it. Here we ordered the medium wings, mixed flavor to split. I chose the udon noodle soup and my partner had the Korean tacos. After a considerable wait, everything came out at once. It might have been nice for the waiter to ask if we wanted it all at the same time, but I didn't mention to bring the wings first either, so I'll cut him some slack. I may be wrong, but since we ordered the wings, I thought it was going to be only wings (per the menu), but it was a mix of wings and drums. Maybe I'm not clear on how they classify them. The worst thing was that they were barely warm. Wings need to be piping hot to be really good, and for this reason they were a letdown. The soup and tacos were hot, so I'm assuming they had the wings made and were waiting for the others to finish. I decided not to send them back since the other dishes would have gotten cold waiting. I mentioned to the waiter when we were done that I would have been much better if the wings were hot. My companion liked his tacos, but I thought the udon broth did not taste great, possibly because it was vegetarian. It also seemed to me a fairly small order for $8.95, but it worked out well since I didn't like it that much anyway.

My suggestion would be that, when you order their wings, make a point of telling your wait person you want them hot when they come out."}
{"text":"This place was well worth the drive. The chicken was wonderfully crispy. For two hungry people we probably should've gone with the medium size (20) rather than the unfinished large (30) we ordered. There are only two flavors: a soy and a spicy. But both are great and it was good to switch off when the spicyness snuck on me. There weren't many options in terms of other dishes. We did order the japchae which had a great Smokey taste and aroma. It was a great atmosphere, sitting at the table watching the Winter Olympics on the mounted TV screens."}
{"text":"After eating at a Bonchon in Columbus for the first time I was hooked. The food is amazing and for me the chicken is like crack. I cannot get enough. This locations building is really cool with the wood and metal, very modern industrial. The inside is decorated very well and has large seating area inside as well as a large bar and a nice patio outside. 

We arived around lunch time.  The place was not jammed but it was busy. After about 10 minutes of being seated we noticed their was only one server that day. The manager apologized for the wait and did give us some drinks, but we still waited another 15 minutes to put our order in. 

We ordered the salmon avocodo ball (avocado, crab, cucumber, fish roe, wrapped in seared fresh salmon, topped with spicy mayo, unagi sauce and crunchy tempura bits). The layers of flavors are amazing its very fresh and this is a go to dish for us.

Pork Buns (steamed boa buns, pork belly, topped with cucumbers, cole slaw, and katsu sauce). The combinations of flavor are great, love pork belly anything, if I had a complaint it was the pork belly peices  were smaller than the buns. 

Bibimbap w/bulgogi (white rice, vegetables, egg, Bulgogi,  topped with Korean red pepper paste). Spectacular. Very light fresh and perfect flavor.

Korean Fried Chicken Wings with soy garlic sauce. Now these little gems would be my last meal on earth. The chicken is juicy, and that breading is so crunchy and the sauce I would like to just bathe in it. Even after the super slow service, we would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not a very good version of Korean food . 
Rice cakes in a sauce tasting quite like buffalo sauce! I am not too sure ! Not our taste ."}
{"text":"A lot more of slick than the Bon Chon I went to while I worked in NYC, which was more of a dive bar that also had a kitchen that made Bon Chon dishes. The sauce here is spicer too. I love the chicken and drag the family once a week. Lots of vegetarian options here as well for my wife and daughter and they are willing to customize dishes to make them veggie as well. Highly recommend the chicken strips and  bi bim bap which has significantly improved since they opened since the bowl is now hot enough to properly crisp the rice."}
{"text":"I really shouldn't have compared this place to the location in San Jose, CA. Expectations were placed way too high, but I was hopeful to get a slice of Asian food in suburban Northern Ohio of all places. 

If anything, this place resembles more of a Buffalo Wild Wings, but with Korean inspired wings. I should have taken a note, when our waitress put in an order of \"tay oh bock kee\", but beggars can't be choosers right? 

The size of the chicken wings were much smaller than what I remember and parking gets insanely packed.

I think what struck me the most was the vast disparity in eating atmosphere here than back home. While eating, I had an older stranger grab me by the shoulders and criticize the way I was eating chicken and suggested that I try chopsticks since I'm Asian. Haha no thanks."}
{"text":"Came here on a friends recommendation and I'm glad I did.  Stopped in for lunch on two separate occasions and have tried both flavors of chicken (prefer the spicy).  I've only gotten the strips with rice as a side, would really like to come back for dinner and try some of the other styles of cooking as well as dishes."}
{"text":"BONCHON IS BOMB!
We came here today for lunch and will be coming back again and again! Hello Korean Fried Chicken! Service was outstanding by server Ronnie who explained everything on the menu, gave suggestions and even told us how long the food would take! Quality shows through here, our chicken came out super fresh, tasted amazing and was not greasy or dry! The batter was crispy and not thick, the wings and drums were HUGE, and the soy garlic sauce was so delicious! The theme is sports bar like with awesome Asian fusion apps, a real treat in N.E. OH! So happy we came here!!"}
{"text":"I have seen Bonchon built up from nothing and was always curious to try their food once the building was present. I finally had the chance to grab dinner there and was pretty excited! 

Bonchon is known for their Korean flare to chicken wings, so I had to try it. I love spicy food, but was a bit afraid to see how spicy their spicy wings are, so I went on the safe side and ordered the small combo of the soy garlic wings and drumsticks (6 wings + 3 drumsticks) and a side of the spicy sauce. My friend ordered her meal and an order of the seasoned fries. Let me just tell you, the seasoned fries were so fresh and had the perfect flavor added! Wonderful choice! What was different about Bonchon's chicken and chicken wings would you have at a bar is the natural crispiness of the skin and tender flavor of the meat. The chicken from Bonchon's was barely breaded, so the natural crispiness of the outer layer came straight from the skin itself. I thought the flavor in which I ordered was going to be garlic-ier (if that is a word), but it was the perfect hint of garlic! No one likes garlic breath! By the end of our meal, neither one of us were able to finish our meals, but we were happy to bring leftovers home. For the small combo of $12.95, you cannot beat this deal! I can't wait to come back and enjoy some delicious food on their patio!"}
{"text":"This place is good. Their KFC is very flavorful.
\"Spicy\" hits hard then the heat quickly dissipates.
We also ordered the bulgogi, which sadly arrived not hot.
It was still very tasty.
We'll go back again. 
It's the best Bonchon we've been to.
Can get very loud at times."}
{"text":"I took my 89 year old mother here because she lives one street down and was curious about it.  We arrived here about 2:00pm and there were only 4 other customers.  As soon as the server arrived my mother told her that this was the ugliest restaurant she had ever been in.  My mother simply couldn't understand their lunch menu so I told the server to get her the Chicken Fried Rice seasoned as mildly as possible.  I ordered the Seafood Bibimbap.  My mother's fried rice turned out really well, my bibimbap was only marginal."}
{"text":"Great food!  The place is very nice and brand new. Great beer and wine selection. Went for lunch and got the Chicken Katsu and the person I was with got the Bonchon salad with fried chicken. Nice sized portions and reasonably priced. Can't wait to go back and try more of the food. Lots of interesting dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from friends in the Baltimore area and realized they opened a location near my parent's home. So we decided to give it a try and OMG! The soy garlic wings and drumsticks are to die for! It's literally crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Best Korean wings we had!"}
{"text":"I waited so long for this place to open. I have been here 5 or 6 times. And each time I left satisfied. First you must get the double deep fried wings. The soy garlic is the best by far. The hot is pretty dang hot. ( although I heard from other people it wasn't) perhaps it's inconsistently hot? Either way it's good. I love the bibimbap dish with bulgolgi. That's a favorite dish for sure. I can't say this place is a 5 star because it isn't totally mind blowing good. The chicken strips weren't the greatest. But other than that... if you see Koreans eating t a Korean place... that says something. It's good stuff. Give it a shot. You won't be let down. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could"}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with these fried chicken wings - move over BWW! You have the choice of a mix of wings with or without drumsticks, and spicy or soy garlic sauce. The way they prepare the chicken makes the skin so crispy but at the same time removes the inner layer of fat and maintains the juiciness in the meat. We also tried a couple of other items today (Japchae clear noodles and marinated ribeye Korean tacos) which were also very good. The ambience is casual and laid back, the service friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Stopped once, loved it.  Stopped twice, brought new friends, loved it. Stopped three times, new friend, loved it. This place is addictive. The best wings in the world, and I'm not a wings person!"}
{"text":"Bonchon is a chain of Korean style fried chicken and other Korean dishes.  This is the 1st location in this area and is worth a visit.  Located in an attractive freestanding building on Broadview Road in Seven Hills, part of a large commercial strip.  The lot is a bit small, when I arrived it was full and had to park on the side street.  

Once inside you find a good sized room with a bar on one side, a partition down the middle and plenty of tables.  The decor is modern and there are flat screens ringing the room showing sports.   The menu is rather small, but with enough variety to provide for most everyone.  Service was overall good, with attention when we wanted it.

I ended up ordering the Seafood Bibimbap; a large hot pot filled with rice, topped with vegies, the seafood and a raw egg, plus a side of spicy miso sauce.  The idea is to mix it up and let the rice cook to crispy at the bottom of the bowl.  Overall this was enjoyable, the red miso is essential to get the whole thing tasting good; the seafood was a mix of smaller shrimps, bay scallops and some squid, nice, but nothing special.  My favorite parts of the the dish were the mushrooms, great slices with excellent flavor and wonderful umagi; and the crispy rice at the bottom which has nice crunch.

I also got to try Takoyaki, a dumpling with octopus inside; good, but not what I expected since it was more other filling with just a small piece of chewy octopus.  Unlike most Korean places, you don't get the banchon; small dishes of kimchi and pickles and such; they do serve some pickled daikon with the chicken, which was a bit sweeter then I am used to.

Overall a fun experience, I might stop back if I am in the area at lunch time; worth a try if you like the menu."}
{"text":"Give this place somewhere b/t 3-4 stars: price, taste, originality and location. First off, the prices are crazy overpriced.  The chicken is to die for tasty good. We ordered:
Medium combo $23.95 for 5 drums and 10 wings (I know right!?). The taste is amazing, however, for $24 ridiculous in price. The drums and wings are medium sized. It's best to eat back and forth b/t the hot and soy garlic so your mouth doesn't burn up.
Calamari appetizer - $14, overpriced and so blah and small portion, too much breading...we're still wondering if it was frozen. Don't order this as you can get so much better elsewhere.
House Fried Rice add bulgogi - $13.95. This was a terrible rendition of good fried rice. So sweet, small portion and the bulgogi was paper thin and dry/overcooked. We threw it away.
Salmon Avocado Ball: $11.00. This was awesome! Definitely, recommend and original.
Takoyaki (fried octopus dumplings) $7 for 6. Very tasty and we ordered 2 orders. Not a lot of octopus, however, there was excellent flavor and creaminess in each dumpling. Try for originality.

We'd go back for specific items...however, not go out of the way as depending on what we're in the mood for, (chicken or steak or Chinese or Vietnamese or Asian, etc), we can satisfy that through so many other restaurants all around."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sign is huge in front of its building so it was easy to spot the restaurant! I have attached some pictures that I took today. Spicy wings are not that spicy if you can tolerate spicy food, so we got medium half spicy and half garlic. They were so crispy and yummy!! :) I will definitely come back after the grand opening and try more foods!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bibimbap with tofu to go, and I am SO disappointed. There were huge chunks of eggshell, and also multiple chunks of meat. (I submitted photos.) I am a vegetarian, so I wasted my money and can't even eat the food I ordered. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Would've given four stars based simply on food, but they get five due to their great customer service. Placed an order for takeout (which took about 25 minutes, in case anyone is wondering) over the phone and ordered some bulgogi bibimbap, but I was misheard and arrived to find I was given a full (more expensive) order of the bulgogi. Once I explained my issue, they made me the bibimbap free of charge - very kind of them.

Now, onto the food. I got the soy garlic chicken strips, which were pretty good, but not the absolute BEST I've ever had. My brother ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and was very happy with it - said the chili paste/sauce was to die for. We also ordered the takoyaki (octopus balls), which tasted essentially like sushi, but were still good. The full order of bulgogi was very good, very sweet and tender.

Overall, I'd certainly come back, but the food didn't personally blow me out of the water. My brother might say otherwise though! It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I believe this place is relatively new but it was a pleasant surprise. This place specializes in Korean fried chicken and other Korean specialties. I can't comment on the other dishes (since I didn't try them during this visit) but I can focus on the chicken wings which was my primary focus for checking out the restaurant. The restaurant itself has a nice modern layout and during the summer months I imagine it's quite nice as well since the outside area opens and the \"garage door\" to the outside opens as well. During this visit we got 1 small order of chicken wings and 1 small order of chicken strips. The chicken overall comes in 2 flavors which are soy garlic and spicy. Seems a bit limited at first but both of these flavors easily hold their weight and are very good.  My favorite was the  chicken strips. We go an even split on the flavors on both. The soy garlic has a nice subtle flavor with a hint of garlic which isn't too overwhelming which works well. I really liked the spicy flavor as it's different than regular hot sauce you'd get from other chicken wing places. I love spicy food and can say the spicy flavor here is indeed spicy.  It comes on slow , hits you then slowly disappears leaving you with a tingling greatness. The wings themselves are quite meaty as well and you can tell they are REAL CHICKEN as apposed to other places with mostly breading. Overall I think this place is worth a visit and I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"My favorite food when I'm back in town, very authentic Korean in an upscale environment. Get the house friend rice for sure!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed every bit of my meal. Chicken is what they special in. I recommend this for any occasion. Great bar as well"}
{"text":"Went on a whim on as my sister told us about this place. Didn't know what to expect since it's a \"chain\" restaurant but we were pleasantly surprised! 
Ordered the Korean Tacos with Spicy Chicken for our appetizer. 3 pretty big soft tacos had a good \"kick\" to them. I ordered the Bibimbap made with the Bulgogi served in a sizzling hot stone like bowl. My husband ordered the Bulgogi dinner. Both were pretty good! I'd say excellent but because even though everything was fresh and prepared well, somehow I could still tell it was a \"chain\". Probably because everything was very uniform in size and a little \"Americanized\". This is of course probably just because we have Korean friends and have home made Korean food before. 
Ordered a side of Kimchi which was excellent but ridiculously small (in a small Solo condiment cup) for $3! 
Had craft beer and straight up Vodka martinis made with Ciroc - can't believe those were only like $5 or $6!(can't recall) Wonder how much \"well\" vodka martinis would have been(?) 
Like others said - a nice sports bar atmosphere with a huge bar and tons of large screen tv's - designed in Chip & Joanna Gaines (from HGTV) style. Oy-Vey! 
Anyway....next time we'll try the Korean Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"Had another opportunity to revisit, this time to dine-in.  We got seated and reviewed the menu and went with the following:

- large wings 1/2 n 1/2 (30 Wings)
- pork buns
- tteok-bokki 
- tako-yaki
- seasoned fries
- aide order of kimchi

I retained 3 stars because of the wings!  The wings make this place worth visiting!  The hot is hot, be warned!  The wings are crispy and delicious.  We actually got the wings before we got our other foods.  We did end up ordering another large wings!!

- pork buns - not worth ordering.  The buns were dried out and the pork belly used in the bun were bit dried and hard.  All items in pork buns needs to be soft, including the pork belly.

- Tteok-bokki- for $13 I expected a lot of rice cake... sadly I only found about 10 pieces of rice cake.  The dish also included- chewy noodles, dish cake, Kim Mari, onions and green onions.  Not worth the $13.

- tako-yaki- don't bother ordering.... definitely not freshly made in house, more like frozen item reheated, masked with toppings and served.

- seasoned fried wasn't bad.... didn't really taste the Parmesan cheese but the fries wer crispy!

- kimchi not worth the $3, skip out.

If you order tteok-Biko and you have leftover broth, order a side of rice, pour that in the sauce and mix it and enjoy!

Chicken for sure, all other items, use your judgement."}
{"text":"Very nice looking place with a modern decor! Everyone that worked there was very helpful, I give the staff A+! But the food was just ok and very pricy. I got the fried rice which was good and the tacos (again good) but just not $20+ good. $12 for tacos and a side of rice would make a big difference."}
{"text":"It's good. The food is tasty, the atmosphere is nice and the staff was friendly. 

Don't expect a lot of quantity for your money though. It's kinda costly. 

Also, there aren't \"meals\" per say. Like no dinners with sides and salad etc. 

I do think they are on a soft open at this time so maybe things will change."}
{"text":"When I heard there was a Bonchon in Cleveland I was immediately aroused. I had eaten at a Bonchon in NYC several years ago and still remember them as the best wings I've ever tasted. Plump, crispy, juicy - a true delight.

The wings at the Bonchon in Cleveland did not compare favorably. While crispy, the juicy and flavor components do not compare to its' NYC bretheren. In fact, they end up being fairly mediocre wings. I ordered the 8 wing lunch special with half soy/garlic and half spicy. Store bought sauce taste. Very disappointed with the wings given my excitement for my previous Bonchon encounter.

On the positive side, the service was good and the interior is clean, open. They have a few tables on an outside patio that would be inviting during summer. 

Won't be back for the wings specifically but may give other menu options a try given good service."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots! We make the half hour drive to come for the soy garlic and spicy tenders and fried rice bowl. The Bull Dak is yummy yummy if you like really really spicy... you'll leave planning your next trip"}
{"text":"Good! Tried calamari, spicy chicken, bulgogi and japchae. Spicy delicious. Some white people might find it too spicy. Me and my wife split ten. The spice builds as you eat them. It's not spicy right up front. Bulgogi was good and tried some of my wife's glass noodles. She enjoyed her dish. Nice interior and the garage doors were open. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Wow, a Bonchon in CLE!? Now can they finally open up an H-Mart here too? Pretty please?!?! We wanted to try this place at right after it opened, but fighting crowds just didn't seem worth it (especially since it's a bit far out compared to all the other Asian restaurants...is there something special about this area?). 

The restaurant looks brand new, and has TV's surrounding all the walls. It has a sports bar atmosphere, so now we can watch all the games while enjoying our Korean fried chicken (woot). 

We were seated right away after arriving, so thankfully there wasn't a wait for the table at least. We decided on the bulgolgi sliders, salmon salad, and the mixed half and half (soy sauce and spicy) fried chicken. The sliders and salad came out at a reasonable time, but wow did we have to wait a while for the chicken. It was at least half an hour after we got sliders and salad that we finally got the chicken. Our server at least stopped by to apologize for the wait, saying \"I'm sorry for the wait, but the chef mixed up your chicken order.\" If there are only two flavors for the fried chicken, how do you mix up the order?! 

As for the fried chicken itself, we were quite pleased when it finally came out. Piping hot, the skin was crispy, and wow did the spicy flavor have a nice kick to it. On a cold fall day, one can't help but smile when she has spicy Korean fried chicken in front of her. The soy sauce chicken was a nice balance in between, so I could still feel my lips and wasn't burning too badly from the spicy flavored chicken. The radish(daikon) unfortunately wasn't so fresh, which was disappointing since one always needs the cooling crunch of the radish while enjoying Korean fried chicken. Overall we were happy with the food, but wait time for the food itself is still an issue. I probably would come back to have some more chicken, but only if there was nothing else scheduled that day."}
{"text":"I heard that this was suppose to be like my all time favorite restaurant which is Korea house located on e32 and superior.  Heard that they bought it. What a let down. I was expecting the same service as korea house. Didnt get that. Ordered by favorite dish. Japchea and it didnt even taste like it. On too of that at korea house they give u apps first. We got nothing here but bad food and horrible service by a server/ bartender that did not obviously want to be there. Oh well. Very disappointed. I was happy cause I live by this place. Didnt have to drive to the east side. Figured same food was right here. Boy was a wrong ill just stay at korea house"}
{"text":"Wow. Never thought Korean fried chicken would be this good.  I secured the wings, legs and glass noodles.  All great. I wpuld choose the legs over the wings if given a choice.  Treat  yourself!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. I would give this place a 2 except I'm feeling generous because I know they just opened. The food was good, in particular the chicken, Takoyaki,  and the Korean tacos. The udon noodle soup was mediocre and the popcorn chicken was poor - had very little chicken to it. 

So why am I giving it a 3? We had reservations but we had to remind them to seat us even though our table was clearly open and ready. 

Once seated, we sat for 20 min with no waiter and no water. We would have left but it's not fun to pack up 2 little kids and haul them around. Eventually I complained, and 5 min later someone (not our waiter) felt sorry for us and took our drink order. 

Eventually we placed our order and even longer still our food came out---except the chicken. The waiter asked us if we still wanted in---that's how long it took. Of course we still wanted it! That's what Bob Chon is famous for! -_-

Thankfully the did the chicken right. If the manager had come over to apologize- I would have given them a pass- but he didn't deem it necessary to walk around to talk to anyone but the front staff. 

The free valet was nice, and the guys doing it were patient as we had to buckle in a baby and great about telling us to wait inside so we wouldn't be cold. 

I know Bon Chon will hit its stride eventually but for now, if you are in a hurry or have kids who can't sit around for long- I'd skip it."}
{"text":"Korean fried chicken is a delicacy that is very hard to find in Ohio. Fortunately in recent years, Bonchon has expanded their locations to Columbus and now Cleveland. What makes Korean fried chicken different from standard fried chicken is that the former is twice fried, and rather than just drowning the chicken in sauces, each piece of chicken is individually brushed. Depending on which location you go to, Bonchon also offers a variety of Korean, Japanese and Asian fusion dishes, such as buldak and salmon avocado ball.

Bonchon is very expensive, but is worth the price of what you pay for. The chicken is very fine quality, but the skin and sauces are what make Korean fried chicken so good. I highly recommend getting some of the soy garlic wings/drumsticks - the sauce is quite good. As far as sides go, they're worth trying if you've never had them, but the other dishes are not particularly outstanding compared to what you might expect at other Korean and Japanese restaurants.

The service can be slow sometimes, but ultimately the food is the most important part of the experience for me, and on that note Bonchon consistently delivers."}
{"text":"Place was packed...just opened! Good amount of parking and easy to spot off the road...Korean wings never disappoint...not as good as other locations"}
{"text":"I would have rather gotten a more traditional Korean dish but my sister wanted fried chicken pretty bad. I got the boneless half garlic and half spicy while my sister got the bone in. The spicy was too spicy for me and it was like fast food to me because I don't like their fried chicken, I will try this place again but other entrees."}
{"text":"It wasn't too busy when we arrived so we had our choice of table.  I ordered the chicken combo wings and drumsticks, half soy garlic and half spicy.  Wow!  These guys can make some really good fried chicken!  Lightly battered, crispy and lots of flavor from the sauce.  The chicken pieces were a nice size.  I could eat these all day!  The heat of the spicy chicken is addicting.  A side of pickled daikon helps keep the heat of the chicken from getting too overwhelming.  The Bulgogi Bibimbap was pretty good.  Nice presentation with a decent amount of meat, rice and veggies.  It was a lot of food and will satisfy most appetites.  My favorite part was the yolk on top.

Give this place a shot.  Our service was decent and food came out in a reasonable time.  There's plenty of variety on the menu that will please most people.  I think this place will surprise you."}
{"text":"I could have just given 1 star, but feeling generous I'm giving you two. Again, terrible attitude for the ordering service. I ordered a house stir-fried rice by phone and they gave me steamed rice instead. When I was trying to confirm the order the cashier rolled her eyes and said they only have house fried chicken rice and steamed rice. May I ask what's the difference between house stir-fried rice and house fried chicken rice? Besides, your steamed rice is in a container as big as a shot glass. Why didn't you confirm with me when I ordered the rice ? And rolling your eyes?"}
{"text":"Bonchon chicken! I remember when this place opened in Columbus and I never had the time to try it. Everyone I knew had went and raved about the chicken. 

Before we ordered the customers next to us were leaving and advised us not to get the food with 3 flames. Indicates that the dish is very spicy. We stayed away from those dishes this time around. Last night we tried the strips and got half spicy and half soy. We also tried the bulgogi tacos and the takoyakki. Everything was delicious! One of the best takoyakki I've had. I wish the bulgogi tacos had more meat, especially because you have to pay $1 more for beef instead of chicken... they could have thrown on a few more slices on there. The chicken strips were amazing! I would recommend getting half and half to start in case the spicy chicken is too spicy. Surprisingly it was too spicy for my husband and between the both of us he can handle more spice. It was spicy for me but did not linger as long when compared to my husband. But this doesn't discourage him from getting the spicy wings the next time we are out this way."}
{"text":"Last time I stopped here and paid $25 for wings... I got a bucket full of drumsticks... when I complained I heard nothing back... finally went back to try again and ran into the worst customer service possible... when I complained.. the owner just stood and stared without uttering a word or offering a solution.... patronize at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken wings! Both the sauces are good but I always ask for them to mix them together. The seasoned fries are good as well. Have not tried anything else but my friends love everything they have had!  Wish the location in My home town(Columbus, Ohio) didn't close. Use to always order from there when we went home. I am in Cleveland a few times a year so it makes me happy one is so close to there. Maybe one day a location will open in Grand Rapids, Michigan... hint hint!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely packed during the dinner time on a Friday night, so you might have to park on the street because parking is limited.  Honestly I wish they had a bigger parking lot and I truly feel that it is unnecessary to have valet parking, but some people actually do it.

The wings are so delicious with the right amount of crunch on the outside and moist tender meat on the inside.  The bulgogi sliders wee unfortunately dry so we didn't finish it at all.  We also ordered regular French fries and it was pretty good but pretty greasy.

I would seriously give this place a 5 star if the food was as good as the service we got from Ronnie!  This guy was very attentive and entertaining! He helped this experience be an amazing one despite the food being mediocre depending on what we bought.  The wings were amazing and I'm sure we will come back here for that.  

I honestly can say that since this place is new, we will come back to try more things to see the consistency of the food. Of course everything won't be perfect right off the bat because they need to figure out how exactly all the equipment works so we weren't truly disappointed!  Ronnie also had something to do with this experience because he was so understanding with our orders.  He made sure everything went smoothly and apologized for anything that didn't even thought it wasn't his fault at all.  

Would recommend this place for anyone craving a Korean fusion type of food and to watch the game because they have so many televisions!"}
{"text":"I've had dinner here several times over the last year.  Very tasty selections, from the chicken wings to the bulgogi, fried rice, to the Korean tacos.   Tidy, stylish decor.  Good beer selection.  Recommended."}
{"text":"So I literally just had Bonchon for lunch in Manhattan a week ago. It was amazing. easily 5 stars. Fully coated but not dripping wings, quick service, super hot fries. But unfortunately this is a pretty stark contrast. In NYC its more of a quick carryout lunch place in a super small space, while its more like something you'd see on w25th here, and it has a full bar. The prices on the food are identical to what you'd pay off times square in Manhattan.

I'll start off immediately with the concern - they allow zero accommodations when it comes to sauce. I couldn't get some on the side or extra even after offering to pay for it. I can only hope that they budge on this in the coming months. I checked and Ohio is actually the only Midwest locations where Bonchon exists. We like our sauce out here, sometimes completely drenched. I understand that these particular wings shouldn't be dripping in sauce, but the wings I had were about half covered in sauce, with rather large portions without any coverage. At over a dollar a wing, I'd much rather prefer somewhere like Pounders or half price BW3 nights with more flexibility on amount of sauce or allowing sauce on the side, and being way cheaper. 

I also got the seasoned fries, made identical to what I had in nyc, and they are GOOD. Only problem is if you are in a rather large party and they wait for all the food to be ready, the fries will get cold by the time they come out, which is what happened.

My friend who moved here from Korea tried one of the bulgogi sliders. She exclaimed \"its like Lotteria...\" which isn't a good sign as that is basically the McDonalds of Korea. If you are craving bulgogi, get a full bulgogi burger that comes with a side from Drinks Bar and Grill right up broadview. They blow the sliders out of the water for around the same price.

What works amazing as great lunch carryout food in Manhattan doesn't quite work as a full blown family sit-down restaurant in the Midwest suburbs. Maybe a smaller space with cheaper prices and closer to rockside rd and you would see me in here every week. 

All and all I think if you are craving bibimbap or the other traditional korean entrees this may be one of your only options in the area, so that is a plus. My coworker who got the bibimbap said it was good. 

For what you're getting at the price you're paying I think there are infinite other options to choose from and I've offered some in this review. Unless you are specifically craving Korean, I think this location isn't anything remarkable. I will definitely be giving it another go in the coming months to see if anything changes, though."}
{"text":"Came here when they were Newley opened. Pros, the patio is fabulous for this area where we don't have many options. The food wasn't bad and the beer selection was decent. Cons, the service was terrible. The servers were over worked while the owner stayed hidden. When I approached the owner he made mention that his bartender had been working open to close and so that might be why she was edgy while he went on to say that he had also been there all day but had slipped out for an afternoon drink. Despite the bad taste in my mouth I had after that, I returned once for the fried rice, but after getting my bill and seeing how much I paid for rice and a beer, I decided I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"The wings/drums are unreal crispy and reason enough to go back.  The bibimbap and other Korean faves are a bonus. Seriously though, the wings are unreal. Go."}
{"text":"We drive by this place everyday and finally went in. Architecturally the building is beautiful. The food on the other hand, not so great. The menu contains weird items. I wanted to try something different so I ordered the shrimp shumai and a sesame ginger salad with tofu instead of chicken. The shumai which is a dumpling, tasted like someone had prechewed the shrimp and stuck it in the dough. The \"fried\" tofu cubes where white. I don't think I've ever fried anything to a crispy white. It was mealy and awful. Not going to try this place again."}
{"text":"I've gotten wings, both spicy and garlic, a few times. Wings are fried hard which I like. To go service is quick and convenient. My only complaint is that they are a little over priced. 10 wings for $12 and 20 for $23."}
{"text":"The best dinner we've had in a long time. What a clean and pleasant place to eat. There were four of us and we ordered several items including wings. The best wings we've had almost ever. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings, fantastic food and delicious drinks! I've been here twice and both times I have thoroughly enjoyed ever taste."}
{"text":"The best sports bar in seven hills and Parma area

Who thought we would have this kind of trendy sports bar at seven hills which is probably oldest town in Ohio

The best wings strips and drumsticks and I have never failed with any dishes so far (had bibibop bulgogi potsticker japche buldack so far)"}
{"text":"I don't know how the chicken wings/drumsticks are so freakin huge, kind of makes me worry about what kind of chickens I'm eating. Great Korean fried chicken. Decently spicy. I prefer salty over sweet, so I'm not a huge fan, it's more spicy/sweet which is a weird combo for me, personally. Probably don't come here for the other Korean dishes, those you can get elsewhere. Modern bar type of atmosphere"}
{"text":"I really like bonchon chicken- and love crunching into lightly deep fried chicken in varying flavors. I'm a little disturbed about how it's double deep fried so I haven't attempted to make it myself- but I do enjoy some good bonchon chicken aka Korean fried chicken.

Bonchon Chicken is a chain- I've had it before in Maryland and thought it was just a-ok there. However, since we have lack there-of of any Korean fried chicken place within 2 hours of CLE, I was happy this place opened- and got some of my foodie friends to come with me to Seven Hills (random location, but whatevers).

We waited...and waited....and waited. Since it was the soft opening, they probably were really busy, but we waited about 30-45 minutes, and then probably at least another 45 mins-1 hour for our food to come out. We originally ordered the japchae to start out- only to have a dish of duk come out (the Tteokbokki). Err..... we told our already flustered waitress about it- who then went back to the kitchen and came back saying they were out of noodles for the japchae (errrr).... but told us we could have the tteokbokki and that she would take a percentage off of our bill too. Ok, we said. We were getting pretty hungry at that point and just needed to eat something to not turn hangry! It was okay- the duk wasn't too hard or anything, it was pretty soft, but the overall dish..was just okay.

And then after waiting longer...the chicken finally came! For a group of 7 of us, we ordered a large combo as well as another dish of small drums- and it was plenty. The chicken they use is quite huge- I was thoroughly impressed how large the drumsticks are (where they get their chicken, I have no idea, but the chicken was quite good), but I did feel that although the flavor of the soy garlic and the spicy was right...the crispiness wasn't. I just wish it had been a bit more crispier- and bit more crunch. I don't know if it was just because the restaurant had just opened and they were mass producing it... but it was okay.

The chicken is good- there's nothing i have against it, I just wish the chicken here had the usual crunch I like (some great places in Ann Arbor or NYC), when I have bonchon chicken. Nonetheless, since there is lack there-of in CLE, it's an acceptable substitute, and I'll probably frequent this place sometime in the future- but my heart for bonchon chicken is still in other places...."}
{"text":"First time in. Both soy garlic flavored and spicy chicken are great and the chicken is perfectly crispy, not greasy. Full dinner Bull Dak is advertised as fiery and it's spicy good. Wide beer selections and a great wine list. Manager Tina was very gracious. Definitely bringing people back again."}
{"text":"This place is a very refreshing addition to the area. Very nice atmosphere and great food. The soy garlic drumsticks and wings are a must try! Super crispy, but not greasy, and very tender. The sauce is super flavorful. Spicy is good too, but only order it if you really like spicy, because it is VERY hot. We have had the tenders and that's the only disappointing thing I've had here, they're quite dry. So just stick with the bone in chicken. 

The bibimbap and bulgogi tacos are fabulous as well. The bulgogi beef is so tender and flavorful. My husband and I really enjoy coming here and I'm looking forward to summer when they can open up the garage door and we can sit out on the patio!"}
{"text":"Finally! I have been dying for a Korean fried chicken place to open near me, and Bonchon is as good as it gets. Not only are the chicken wings crips to perfection but they also have a great amount of spice (as long as you order them spicy). I also ordered the takoyaki there which was amazing, and I always need a side of the kim chi coleslaw. Not a very good selection of sake though, which is why I give them 4 stars not 5 but this is also a personal preference for me. Apparently the beer list is pretty extensive though, so that is always a plus! The atmosphere is pretty cool and tailored to people that want to go eat and watch games. Location wise it is quite confusing since there are no other restaurants around, but it is worth going out of your way! I am definitely a fan, so four stars for me!"}
{"text":"Total rip off. They are going through major cost savings. Pieces are tiny and price stays high. 
Necer again"}
{"text":"I ordered the 5 drums spicy if you like buffalo wings these are 100 times better than buffalo wings. Also had the pork buns a savory pork belly with vegetables tucked in a soft pillow you get 3 with your order. Flavor of food on point. Are server Taylor friendly and knowledgeable. Lots of Tvs for all the sports action. This korean restaurant is awesome highly recommend great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the owner let us in at 9:45 when they were closing at 10:00. He insisted that we stay for food. I normally would not have done so, he really wanted us to stay. The atmosphere is great as well. Really clean inside as well and friendly staff. . . The food was awesome as well! I would definitely go back again. Thank you for a great time!"}
{"text":"The drums and wings were tasty. The service is prompt and friendly, the atmosphere is fun without being too loud."}
{"text":"I thought I was more excited than anyone about Bonchon opening until I read all these reviews and figured out that everyone else was driving by and stalking the Facebook page for weeks, too!

Now that I've been there, I'm sad to report that it wasn't as amazing as I remember it after visits to Korea and NYC locations, but it was alright. I think a lot of the less-than-stellar aspects can be chalked up to growing pains for sure.

The food was good but not as good as I remember it to be. But honestly, doesn't food always taste better when you're on vacation?

Besides everything coming out a little cold (also - the ceiling fans are super powerful and by the end of our meal, the least remnants of food were full on chilled), everything seemed a little overcooked and undersauced.

The service is still working out some issues - our server was super friendly but maybe a little overwhelmed - he forgot about us and it took an absurdly long time to get the check...even after flagging him down a couple times. 

However, they get so much slack for just having opened a couple days earlier and serving a packed house on a Friday night! 

I will definitely be back once the full menu is available and things are running a little more smoothly."}
{"text":"Pricy and very low quality chicken. Extremely disappointed. I feel sick. I liked the French fries though."}
{"text":"I give 5(!) stars.  First timer, service was excellent and the food followed suit.  The Bon Chon Wrap with beef was outstanding.  Shrimp Shumai (fried) was very tasty, and the Drum wings were up to the high expectations.  Will definitely be back.  Oh, and I really liked the music (reminds me of The Rail).  Thumbs way up."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to giving this place a try. It looks super neat and a refreshing change to the buildings in the area. It's cute and modern and the patio (can't wait for spring!) look so welcoming. I love Korean food, and I love chicken, so I didn't think there was much that could turn me off. 

1) Great prices on beers. Exorbitant prices on wine. They did the thing where they charge for 6oz pour ($6+ and this is not a full pour) and then for a 9oz (which is a regular pour) and the prices are all over the top. Any restaurant that does this 6 and 9 ounce pour business is tacky and it's an instant deal breaker for me. Why sell wine? 

2) We tried the shumai and chicken strips. The strips were tasty and perfectly cooked. Both flavors are interesting. I preferred the ginger soy because the spicy was like trying to eat something that was bathed in the fires of hell. They should really have a warning for how hot they are!

3) They have live music some evenings which is cool, but it's impossible to hear anything bc the place is small and it was crowded. Tons of TVs all over the place. It would be nice to hang out here when the weather gets nicer and the garage doors are open perhaps. 

Overall, I'm confused. Are you a bar? Are you a restaurant? The wine prices and food options would make me think they want to be a restaurant, but the beer, TVs and loud music leads me to believe it's a bar. Identity crisis."}
{"text":"Hi! My name is Allie and I'm a Bonchon addict!
I came in recently to try out their Korean fried chicken.  I'm a regular at a few Korean spots around town so I wasn't really looking to try any of the other menu options.  This spot is most similar to a gastropub, it's a bar that serves really good fried chicken.  They have quite a few t.v's playing sports and a nice large patio with garage doors to use during nice weather.

My party ordered a few orders of the fried chicken, one combo with 1/2 spicy and 1/2 garlic soy, the other was a large drums in garlic soy.  FYI when you look at the menu, it says DRUMS not drumettes which is what is typically served as a chicken wing.  These drums that we ordered were the part of chicken that attaches to the thigh so 2 per person is pretty filling.  Don't say I didn't warn you when two people try to split a large order of chicken drums to realize it's 15 drums and there is NO WAY to eat it all.  But don't worry the chicken tastes great cold or reheated at home!  Also SPICY means spicy, I like my fair amount of spicy Asian food but these kicked my butt, the pickled radish was a nice reprieve.  The chicken was tender and juicy and the cornstarch batter was light and crispy.  It is nothing like southern fried chicken but don't worry, you'll realize it's much better than the breaded and crispy chicken of the south. Overall a great korean fried chicken spot, if you want traditional Korean food look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food.
Wings were crispy, spice was spicy lol, soy was perfect. Fries was enough for 2 people. Prices are decently fair, $30 for two people."}
{"text":"Umm,wings are delicious, very good!Bimbabap fresh,just pricey and very slow. Ordered to go, waited 45 mins..."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them 6 stars!

I love chicken wings. If you're? looking for something a little out of the ordinary or as Emeril likes to say...kick it up a notch this is the place for you. These Korean chicken wings are some of the best I ever had. Got the half? and half soy garlic and spicy. They are not dripping with sauce like other places and still taste fantastic. They serve a side of pickled radish (daikon? I believe) which is a beautiful accompaniment? just like the celery and blue cheese served with an American version. The seasoned? fries are out of this world! They are speckled with what seems like parsley and wasabi and have a nice kick to them. I had lunch there today and literally go back there tonight for dinner. I will definitely? be a regular at Bonchon."}
{"text":"Words can't describe the happiness I feel that bonchon has opened in the cleveland area! Having lived in NYC for 8 years, bonchon was a regular meal for me. IT IS SO GOOD!! The chicken, the fries, you simply can't go wrong. So crispy and the perfect amount of spice. I also loved the interior of this location . The decor and bar were amazing and I can definitely see coming here for the football games. Go!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing fancy. The beverages are a reasonable price. Yet the food is expensive for what it is. 4 beers, 6 chicken wings, and steam buns will run you around 50 bucks between 2 people. (without tip) Might as well go to Seoul Garden in Parma and get quite authentic food, more of it, and at a better price.  A couple positive things, the woman serving us was very nice and worked hard.  The bar and eating area is set up nicely to watch sports."}
{"text":"Yay for korean chicken finally opening up around northern Ohio! I've been to several Bon Chon and Kyo Chon and this location does not disappoint. The extra crispy skin is sooooo delicious! I'm sure the location is a bit of culture shock to Seven Hills but that's a good thing. Love it and will be back over & over!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I came here for some wings. The spicy sauce on them were too hot for me but the soy garlic flavor is perfect. The radish cubes that come with the chicken helps with the spiciness. I have noticed that the drums and wings here are a bit smaller compared to the ones at other Bonchon locations. This is a big letdown, especially when the food is pretty pricey. However, the taste of the chicken is still delicious and that's what really matters."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I've only visited here twice in less than one week & their food is amazingly delicious! Will definitely come back & already recommended it to some of my friends!"}
{"text":"For a Sunday during lunch time, Bonchon didn't have many costumers. That was fine with my family, since we didn't want to wait too long anyways for the food. We ordered two bulgogi bibimbap and one japchan. We also ordered a small (6 wings / 3 drumsticks) half and half combo (soy and garlic / spicy).
Our main entrees came first, and the bibimbap was delicious. The bulgogi was flavorful, and the slight spicy sauce that came with it was a nice complement. The bowl was extremely hot, so it took awhile to wait for it to cool. The flavor was excellent though. 
The japchae noodles were also surprisingly tasty. The sauce was amazing. Our wings came before the drumsticks, and the chicken was fried perfectly. It was crispy, sweet, and tangy. The spicy wings were good as well, and the radish helped cleanse my tastebuds. ( It wasn't too spicy personally, but I do not recommend the spicy wings if you know you can't handle spice.) The meat was juicy and tender on the drumsticks. I couldn't get enough of that crunch as well.
Our waiter was very kind to us, and the overall experience was a nice lunch. The building itself is very clean and well designed inside and outside as well. I highly recommend giving Bonchon a try, although it is a little on the pricier side. Overall, a 4.5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Welcome to my hood, Bonchon! I would call this a diamond in the rough scenario. Bonchon is my diamond in a rough restaurant scene around this side of town. Many things sets this place apart from nearby restaurants. This is a place you would expect to be like in downtown, close to the university (uptown by Case) or Tremont. This place is cute and trendy, like most gastro pubs as of late. It has a full on bar with lots of TVs to watch games. and I heard they hosted a karaoke night here too.

But its the food that's the claim to fame here. Korean friend chicken...double deep fried with two sauces to choose from (soy garlic and the spicy). I like spicy food, but this was like Thailand level spicy. Like wow, seriously, it cleared my sinuses and I was breaking a sweat without having finished half my meal. 

When ordering the chicken you can choose between wings, drums or strips. My intel tells me that to get the best bang for your buck with respect to the amount of chicken you get, go with the chicken strips. Once you choose the type of meat, then you order small, medium and large size. It only comes with a side of pickled radish. Which is weird for an asian place not to serve rice automatically.

In a string of some restaurants I've visited as of late that have not tickled my fancy, I greatly welcome being able to boast about this place. I tell everyone to check this place out."}
{"text":"My level of excitement for this place is just a little too high. My love for Korean fried chicken will not be contained! When I lived in DC, I visited this chain restaurant more than I care to admit. When I found out one was coming to Cleveland, I was beyond enthused. I stalked their Facebook page, eager for updates. 

Lo and behold, Bonchon Seven Hills has finally opened its doors to the public. I was surprised to find that the building is actually quite nice. It looks newly renovated and there is more than enough seating, along with a really nicely decked out patio with garage doors. The staff was cordial, although when I first came in to get some information about the restaurant, they were a little curt with me, but I think they were hesitant to announce their official grand opening until they can predict the flow of business after the soft open. 

For my first visit to Bonchon Seven Hills, we ordered a small combo with half garlic, half spicy sauce, along with an order of tteokbokki. The prices for the dishes seem high in my opinion considering they really aren't sized as large as a Korean restaurant typically would to be served family style. You're looking at about $12-$16/ entree which serves about 2 people. Considering there's little competition in the area save for Seoul Garden in Parma though, it's hard to dispute the price. 

If you've never had Korean fried chicken, prepare to have your standards for fried chicken kicked up a notch. It's prepared with corn starch to create a thick, crunchy outer layer that sauce sticks to but doesn't soak into, so the chicken stays crispy on the outside. It seems to me that this location tends to overcook their wings, the chicken on the inside was a bit dried out which was disappointing. Hopefully with time, they are able to adjust based on customer's request. The sauce is perfect though, I didn't personally find the spicy to be very spicy at all, but it does have a good flavor to it as does the garlic. I love the sizing options and that they offer so many different mixes of chicken pieces. As for the tteokbokki, it was exactly what I was hoping for. Great spice level and it was complimented with fish cakes, rice noodles and gimmari, a spring roll made with rice noodles and wrapped in seaweed then deep fried. All in all, this was a solid dish and I would definitely order it again, despite the fact that I think it's overpriced for the portion size. 

In summation, I do have some criticisms of Bonchon Seven Hills, mostly due to the overfried chicken and the prices, but it didn't detract much from my experience, and I still see myself visiting here often. I would highly recommend for others to try, as it's a great way to dip your toes into Korean cuisine that has been simplified and Americanized a bit to make it easier to try out. I think everyone could find something to enjoy here and Korean fried chicken is something that's hard not to love."}
