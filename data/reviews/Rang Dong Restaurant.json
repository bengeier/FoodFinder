{"text":"When I was a high school student, Rang Dong's lunch time service was one of the fastest that I've ever experienced. You and your group would sit down, order, and 2 minutes later the food would arrive steaming hot, and with a plate of bean sprouts, greens, and limes.   My favourite is the pho tai ve don (crunchy flank is #1 if you like a good fatty meat/lean meat ratio). Their ve don cut is nicely sized: not too thick, and not too stringy. I find that sometimes, I get a really large amount of meat in my pho bowl, and other times it does feel a bit less (but only because I know that they do give out a lot of meat in their pho).   Efficient service and has been in the community for as long as I can remember. I like their bo xay, or avocado shakes (good amount of avocado and condensed milk), and their cam vat, freshly squeezed orange juice (good sweetness, and always fresh).   Give it a shot! If you're in the area, $7 for a medium bowl (think: LARGE medium though) of pho is a blessing."}
{"text":"Worst pho in Calgary and the service is really bad as well. I ordered their  pho special. The broth tasted watered down, they gave two small pieces of meat.  The meat was chewy. It was so disgusting. When I asked the waitress where the rest of the meat was, she just ignored me. My husband ordered a vermicelli bun bowl, it was really small for the price and didn't taste very good. The beef they use tastes very chewy and gross.  This place is in the heart of Forest Lawn, you would think most of their customers are Asians, so they would care about the way their food tastes  but their chef is a bad cook and their waitresses are rude. We will never come back there again. It's. Worth the extra two minute drive to 17 ave to noodleworld.  If you want bad service and watered down pho with two pieces of meat, then come here. I would suggest you buy a box of instant pho from Lucky's supermarket next door."}
{"text":"Yum. Great mom and pop restaurant, then service here is decent. Got refills when needed. Food was really good. Parking space is available. The only down side to a mom and pop shop is that it's not as clean as franchise restaurants. But food and service makes up for that. Would recommend to my family members but they all already know about this place lol"}
{"text":"Very quick service. I tried the beef sate and it was alright but once I added the sate chilli sauce, it was the perfect flavour. The ca phe sua da was made perfectly, great balance between sweet and bitter. Loved it!   Free wifi service provided, that's always a bonus"}
{"text":"Hands down!!! The best beef saté in the city great friendly staff!!! Definitely my first choice for phó"}
{"text":"It's a nice small neighbourhood restaurant. Just don't go lunch rush hr since there's a couple of high school close by and it gets really busy. The price are ok...pho are 8.75 for large. Spring rolls at 5 bucks. Nice decor. Good people n service. I don't taste the msg as much in their soup. Looks very clean. Try it if your in the area. It's close by a 7-11 store, lucky supermarket and the east side community health center."}
