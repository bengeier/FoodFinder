{"text":"I love the creative flavors in both the pizza and wings! I could eat the PB&J wings for days! Also loved the pizza varieties we ordered (a friend ordered and recommended it...)!"}
{"text":"!!!!!!!!DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!!!
I've ordered from here a few times but never again will I order anything from them. First off they take forever to deliver. Second off their low prices explain their sloppy put tog food. When I ordered pizza one time it was poorly cut and falls apart when you try to take a piece. They claim to have \"jumbo wings\" but they're just small traditional wings! Last off the manager was very disrespectful and rude over the phone when he failed to deliver my order. I would stick to the usual pizza places like Domino's, Pizza Hut, Marco's, Papa Johns, Jets Pizza, Giuseppe's, Cala's, Mama Primozz, & etc. You'll be treated with better service, better food and fast delivery!!"}
{"text":"After reading these so called \"negative\" reviews on the national pizza and wing co I was totally disgusted! This pizza shop is amazing! I consider myself a pizza lover and take trying new places seriously! Their pizza was so cheesy and the crust was out of this world! The pizza itself was cooked evenly and had just the right amount of sauce and toppings! I don't know what these people are talking about the wings having hardly any meat on them! They were JUMBO wings!! I could only have 2 b/c they were so big! We had excellent service when we were there! We dined in and put in our order! While we were waiting it seemed like they got a couple Togo orders, including one that was a delivery! They were so quick I didn't even notice when the girl came back! These accusations are appalling! Obviously they are from another pizza shop in that area! These negative reviews are just another attack on a pizza shop that is uncalled for! Just plain childish! Take it from me, someone who absolutely loves pizza, great customer service and overall amazing food! Keep up the amazing work guys!! I'll DEFINITELY come back again! :)"}
{"text":"Tried The National for the first time on Sunday, and it was amazing ! We had a garden salad to start with and it was very tasty. I had the hot Italian sub and it was one of the biggest subs I had ever had ! My wife ordered a pizza with pepperoni and banana peppers. The crust was delicious and the sauce was super tasty ! You could definitely tell it was home made. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Noon time.  We have gotten orders before and always good.  Not today. Told 40 minutes but I should have picked it up after 30 minutes or less and it might have been hot.  Ordered pizza, sub, fries, wings, none of which were hot.  Don't think they put them under the warming lights at all.  Pizza was dry; had been baked a while before I picked it up. If I microwave it, it was better.  Disappointed for sure this time. Will hesitate about ordering again soon.  People are really nice but I expect hot food when I live only a mile and half away."}
{"text":"Wanted to try even after hearing not so great things. Ordered a specialty pizza and was not topped very well, huge crust, and some slices were scarce on toppings at that point. Wings were advertised as jumbo....no, they were actually some of the smallest, meatless wings I've ever got from local place. Tried to call not to complain but get explanation since they had no customers....but was insulted so just hung up. I'll stick with Calas, nice try lol... thanks anyway."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how awesome my pizza was today! I ordered a sheet pizza with meatballs, pepperoni and peppers. 
Usually sheet pizzas tend to be dry at most places but not yours. 
Everyone raved about it and asked where it was from."}
{"text":"We always get the hot Italian sub. The pizza is really good with quality ingredients and we love everyone that works there they are all so nice to us !!"}
{"text":"I ordered a small veggie pizza to try them out. Tbe pizza exceeded my expectations. The crust was a nice golden color, had nice fresh vegetables on it and I had asked for light cheese and that is exactly what I received. The sauce is very good so I have to say it was one of the best veggie pizzas I have eaten. This is where I will get my pizza from going forward."}
{"text":"Placed a large order of sheet pizzas, wings and sub sandwich trays for a gathering after a firefighter memorial service.  Lenny, the owner, and his staff went above and beyond to make sure everything was handled just right and the food would be delivered on time.  The food was delicious and I wouldn't hesitate to use The National Pizza & Wing Co again.  Thank you Lenny and staff."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place in the area by far.  Upon walking in the dining room felt very cozy and welcoming.  The employees are very cheerful and helpful.  The pizza was one of the best I've ever had, it came out nice and hot and it didn't take very long.  It was very fresh, you can tell they use fresh ingredients.  The dining room was clean and organized.  I would give this place my highest recommendation."}
