{"text":"The awning still says, \"JP's Cafe\" but it's now just The Cafe and owned by the guys who brought us Cafe Du Jour. So that tells you it's excellent and I could stop right there, but let me go on and insist that The Cafe has the best breakfast in South Side. 

How do I know? Because I'm not getting up at the crack of dawn to make my own fruit-filled pancakes, so I've shopped around and this is where I spend my breakfast dollars. (It doesn't take many of them to fill up at The Cafe.) And because the delicious aroma of breakfast at The Cafe is what wakes me up every morning and gets me motivated to start the day. 

Stop in for one of Patty's big breakfasts. Try one of Dan's new wraps for lunch. And look for his entries in the yearly South Side Mid-Winter Soup Contests! You like soup!  And you'll love The Cafe."}
{"text":"Jp's is the best breakfast option on E. Carson. The food was tasty, cheap and the place is cozy, with 10 tables total.

After being disgusted by O'leary's, we searched up and down E. Carson for breakfast places. We were lucky to find this place."}
{"text":"Brought the family here for linner today. My wife and I both ordered the Belly Bomber cheeseburger. A full pound of sirloin beef. My review is pretty much based on the burger alone. Yes this is a very old casino in the older part of Henderson. There's definitely a nostalgic vibe going on here and that's not really a bad thing. I like these smaller and older hole in the wall type places more so then the modern huge casinos.
  So the burger comes with fries and all the fixings. Lots of lettuce, tomatoes and onions. Make sure your hungry because this burger is huge. It tastes pretty good, more like a homemade burger. The fries weren't that great but the whole meal is $4.99. I've had other meals here and they have some really good prices with good portions. Another cool thing about this place is it's rarely busy so you'll usually get seated right away. They are a little slow with taking your order and bringing it the food but that's no biggie to me. I enjoy coming here with the family and plan to make this an irregular go to place to eat from time to time."}
{"text":"This place is cheap! You get a lot of food for your money and it's pretty good too.

I didn't like the cheese they used on my omelette, but the home fries were awesome, and the bread they use for their toast is delicious."}
{"text":"First, don't use the half/half after 9AM!  

This is a little coffee shop slash grab in go place - soda, chips, beer, pre-made sandwiches. 

Coffee is good! I've got an Americano  in hand. Ask for a plain, toast bagel w/cream cheese. (Don't judge me. No this is not listed in the Atkins book.) I got a wheat bagel that was warmed. Folks in Arizona must have different definition of \"Toasted.\" Cream cheese are those little cups ...fine, but let's keep them refrigerated people. Saw them just sitting on the counter in a hotel pan. 

This really got my attention: coffee shop, counter to add creamer, sugar etc. ( like you'd find at Starbucks.) Lady before me ask the counter person for more half/half. The counter person proceeded to just pour more half/half in to the same pitcher! Didn't rinse it. Didn't wipe down the dried milk atop. ...think about this a minute. At the end of the day, 17-18 hours later (they open at 5AM. Assuming they close around 10PMish. )
 the milk collecting around the top has been sitting there all day. Too bad they could afford a few more pitchers to have prefilled and wash the empty ones as needed. 
Next, ( I'm on a roll. I hate bad service and unhealthy practices. It's the chef in me.) As soon as the line to order was cleared,  they started flirting with each other. Believe me, I don't have a problem with flirting, but not at work, not when customers are within ear reach. I standing there waiting for my coffee.

So, yes, I'll return ...tomorrow. I'm stuck here at this absolutely beautiful hotel for a few days ;-)

(A word to the wise (and from a 30yr veteran chef): Be very cautious of warm dairy products. Oh, and why 9am? 4hrs is your max time you can leave someout to get warm. They open at 5Am ....you can do the math.)

UPDATE: The manager got ahold of me and my concerns were noted and will be corrected. I'm moving my star rating from 1 to 3. Thank you for watching out for people's health."}
{"text":"I was kinda disappointed with the food. I understand $1.89 breakfast can't sustain paying the bills if business is down. We arrived looking forward to our favorite Deuces Wild breakfast but found a fifties themed diner with a whole new menu. We're happy to try something new.  The restaurant is called Mary's Diner. It's cute and thankfully the old servers are still there. Lupe is a doll, has been here for 22 years! 

So the prices went up, my Skillet was $6.99,which is not a bad price, but I was hoping it would taste good too but it was really bland instead. There is less of a breakfast selection, gone are the old favorites. No substitutions either. Talk about corporate menu unfriendliness. 

I do hope corporate makes a few tweaks to improve the food. I like the service and the servers here. They've all been here a long time and we would have fun razzing them when they wore a football jersey from an opposing team. That's gone too. :-("}
{"text":"Employees were nice and the iced coffee I got was really good. A bit overpriced I feel but that was expected as this is a higher end resort. The outdoor patio is so nice to sit outside and enjoy when you grab your cup of coffee and relax."}
{"text":"It's been at least 5 or 6 years since the last time I visited this joint.  I worked at the Eldorado Casino back in the mid 90's and this place use to have decent food......that was back when it was named \"Cactus Joe's\".  It's really gone downhill since those days.

I happened to be in the area and stopped by for lunch with my Mom.  I ordered the Nachos w/o Meat and Mom ordered the Fish & Chips special.

After a short wait we were served our food.  I was disappointed to see that the Nachos were Chips, Cheese Whiz, Tomatoes, Onions on a plate with a small bowl of Beans, cup of Guacamole, cup of Salsa, and two packages of Sour Cream on the side......what the ___?  Was I suppose to create this thing myself?  Where did it say that on the menu?  I know why they did it.....to save money.  There's less food waste when you do stuff like that, but seriously?

As a fan of Nachos it was a huge letdown.....plus they didn't taste good at all.  The Chips weren't fresh and the flavors were just strange.....unappealing.

Mom enjoyed her Fish & Chips, which were really Fish & Fries.  She liked her Fish and I tried a few Fries...they weren't bad.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item?

Overall, the service was good and since Mom enjoyed her dish I'm giving this place 2 Stars instead of 1.

Will I return?  Someday I probably will for the sake of nostalgia....but I predict it won't happen any time soon."}
{"text":"This was my second visit for breakfast.  The Cafe was located in the Eldorado Casino in Henderson, Nevada.

The $1.89 Breakfast Casino Special during the week was such a bargain.  It was fast and inexpensive."}
{"text":"The Cafe is your on site option for anything other than sit down dining or in-room service. Basically a high end deli located on the main patio, The Cafe serves breakfast, lunch, snacks, coffee and ice cream.

Open the earliest and surprisingly efficient considering the volume of guests being served. You can expect a short line and wait at peak times, particularly in the morning when everyone realizes there is no dark roast for your room's Keurig!

We sampled the food only once, on getaway day, enjoying a bacon and egg sandwich on a warm croissant, along with a cup of rich, dark coffee. Prices were high-ish but not unreasonable. 

The biggest plus is the ability to step outside and grab comfortable seating on the huge patio, sporting umbrella covered tables, multiple fire pits, and views across the expansive lawn. 

Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Goodbye cool little quiet place. Another one bites the dust. I smell corporate wanting more dollars. LOL!"}
