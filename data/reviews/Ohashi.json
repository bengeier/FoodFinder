{"text":"This sushi store is hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes, should be big like Leann Rimes, if you are all about value, come to Ohashi.

the food is far beyond the price you will pay for it. Our calamari appetizer was so beautiful that it would have been 15 dollars at any other restaurant and the sushi will make you to come back when the next craving strikes."}
{"text":"If I was giving a review on how nice these people are I would give them 50 stars.  However, the food is so bad and people must know it because it was EMPTY.  The waitresses hovered and was annoying.  I was asked twice if everything was okay as if she knew it was bad.  Sign n√∫mero uno that the sushi is bad...the fish is wrapped in Saran Wrap so it can last day after day. Not fresh, just cheap.  So sad for this place."}
{"text":"The quality and price of the sushi at Ohashi is second to none. Ohashi is my go-to sushi spot because of the unique rolls, awesome service and excellent quality and standards. I've eaten at Ginko, Parallax and other Cleveland sushi spots and Ohashi is right up there with the best. If you frequent the restaurant, the owner, Jackie, makes a point to get to know you and make you feel welcome. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm...some of the best agedashi tofu ever!  And the sushi was mighty tasty as well - fresh and lovely.  Super yum, and the price was right, too!"}
{"text":"Wish I could rate the food. Apparently they close at 2:30PM, and if you arrive at 2:10PM you will not be permitted to eat. The woman I spoke with didn't seem to care that my girlfriend and I made a special trip to North Olmsted just to try their sushi, nor that we offerred to take any remaining sushi \"to go\" promptly at 2:30PM. Like the Jovial Buddha, she simply smiled and gestured toward the door."}
{"text":"My Favorite Sushi place.  Not posh like sushi rock (the same people work there every time we go and know us by name)...but the quality is beyond compare.  Half price M-TH 5-6pm.  Mike is the sushi chef everyday...he makes the perfect roll.  PS... try the Super Dreamy Roll...you'll never be the same again."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, service, and atmosphere. As good or better than any other sushi restaurant on the West Side. Very traditional style sushi bar and a good, not great, selection of sushi, sashimi, and rolls. Fish was fresh tasting, good size (neither too big or too small) and served at the right temperature. 
Negatives: Tempura didn't seem to be breaded and cooked fresh and the beer selection was limited and didn't include any Asahi selections."}
{"text":"I travel all over the country on business so I saw the numerous positive reviews here and decided to stop in.  What I found here is very small Negri pieces that are overpriced.  Service was good but can't make up for the tiny pieces and high prices."}
{"text":"Tried out this Korean-owned Japanese restaurant to introduce a relative to Japanese cuisine, also because of the Yelp rating and a severe hankering for a nice Japanese meal after recently returning from several years living in the country -- walked out with very mixed feelings.

What we ordered: Tonkatsu set meal w/ miso soup and salad, inarizushi, house warmed sake, and yaki udon.

Tonkatsu was quite decent and actually comes with two cutlets instead of one. Miso soup wasn't bad either.

Inarizushi was small and lacked anything more than a simple rice filling, but it was quite delicious. The tiny Korea-centric grocer next to the restaurant sells cans of the inari tofu pockets, I wonder if they simply use that. 

Warmed house sake was really, really good. Perfect winter treat.

The Yaki Udon was revolting, as oily as poorly done Chinese food and ludicrously expensive ($14!!). The noodles themselves had a pleasant consistency, but I'm pretty sure the chef just bathed them in oil and a drop of Giant Eagle Teriyaki Sauce, mixing some mushrooms and onions in for the hell of it. It was really too bad and having such a terrible, overpriced entree really ruined the experience. 

I was curious to try one of their Donburis but after the udon experience I'd be reluctant to go again for anything more than the sushi bar"}
{"text":"After reading all the awesome reviews I wanted to check this place out. I usually go to Sakura in Strongsville and it never disappoints. The staff here was awesome! Very nice and prompt. The food? Awful.... I'm hoping I just went on an off night. With all the good reviews I'm guessing I got old sushi or the other people reviewing this place has no idea what good sushi is

I think I'll pass on this place next time"}
{"text":"Service is fantastic and food is fantastic! My only disappointment is that they significantly recuded their offerings on half price sushi nights. However, it's so darned good, I'll happily pay full price!

**P.S. I attached photos of the menu to this site**"}
{"text":"Went on a rainy day for the sushi happy hour with my 10 year-old son. The kid likes sushi but only vegetable maki rolls. The first order had some slimy brown thing inside the waitress told us it was Japanese carrots. It was the size of a canned bamboo shoot and limp. The second order for sonny after he poked all the brown limp thing out of the first was another vegetable roll but he did not want the asparagus and we asked if they would substitute american slivered carrots (you know like regular veggie sushi) ooohhhh no not during happy hour. Hello, asparagus is at least $2.99 a pound and carrots can be found for lots less. This made me think that they are cheap people. I ordered the miso with shumai dumplings. The addition of the 3 shumai pumped the price of the tiny bowl miso from $2.00 to $4.50. I asked if the shumai were pre-made and once frozen and the server said yes and I flat out told her that the soup was a rip-off. Those frozen shumai can be purchased at the Asian market for about $1.99 for a dozen.She did not take the soup off the check. I also ordered an Alaska Roll and a Boston Roll. Guess what ...they slice one (31-40 count) shrimp in half for each roll. So in 2 maki rolls there were exactly 2 shrimp. So for 1/2 price sushi, mediocre soup and the one bright  I nearly forgot to mention the $5.00 bowl of warm edamame beans the grand total including tip was $41.56.  My advice, drive to Coventry and eat at Pacific East."}
{"text":"The best sushi in all of the west side. Happy hour 5-6 cuts down on the cost some.  All the ingredients are fresh, really fresh.  They could buy some new chairs or chair pads. They are a bit uncomfortable. Service sometimes leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING and go get the super dreamy roll. They won't tell me how they make the sauce but it is the best sushi roll I've ever had. Ordered it because I saw others on yelp recommend it. So delicious. All other rolls were fabulous as well. Great little find."}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviews that the sushi portions are tiny and prices on the high side.  Quality was ok - nothing special.  What really inspired me to write this was the - I am assuming - owner - he never smiled, said \"hello\" or made any eye-contact.  He looked miserable.  I'm sorry, but when two people, spending money, being polite and thankful, are sitting in front of you - you should probably act appreciative.  WOW.  This dude needs a new gig!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch today. Looks are deceiving! Very large and nice restaurant once you are inside. They have great lunch specials and the fish is very fresh. Very good service as well. 

Would highly recommend for a quick lunch, but they have room for a dinner crowd as well. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It's really tucked behind stuff, so we drove past it looking for it the first time.  It's right behind Fatheads, in the plaza w/ the huge Rite-Aid.

But am I ever glad we rode back around trying to find it!  I read about it on Secret Cleveland's fb page. 

Anyone who thinks highly of any sushi place in Cleveland MUST go here, & they will instantly have a higher standard to hold the others to.

We had the calamari to start, it had some sauce drizzled on it that was AMAZING.  The best calamari I've EVER HAD.  And I've had a lot of calamari.

& the sushi.  Oh my, the sushi.  It was so fresh, so good.  Brought tears to my eyes.  (ok, maybe it was really the spicy tuna roll w/ too much wasabi on it, but still.... tears.)

We tried the Sapporo beer too, it was pretty good.  Nice & light to go w/ the food."}
{"text":"Just ate their recently,  the service is very good, staff is very friendly.  However, the sushi is just ok.  I've had better.  Some of the items are WAY overpriced, for example, the house salad cost $5 and its pretty much a joke.  Mostly iceberg lettuce and its not a big salad at al, not much bigger than the entree salad.  They just put it in a larger bowl and spread out so it looks like you are getting a lot.  Edamame is another item that is overpriced.  I did not like how they make some of their sushi like the Ikura which they have it on cucumber instead of seaweed, it did not taste true and the same with their tobiko.  Their green tea is at best mediocre, not very good.  I don't think I will be going there anytime soon.  I prefer Fujiyama in Avon.  Sushi is much better there and the price is lower and nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all the high reviews are coming from as this was the most disappointing sushi experience I have had. 

I went in with high expectations but the negative reviews were unfortunately spot on. This place is way over priced for what they deliver on. More rice then fish and incredibly small rolls both in circumference and length leads you to wonder what you have paid for. The fish was clearly not fresh, lacked the right texture and flavor and was overall a disappointment."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi rolls!!!--and this from someone who used to live in New York.  Modest decor, stellar food.  I definitely recommend it.  Better than any other sushi I've had in this area hands down."}
{"text":"The sushi is awesome. Authentic & delicious. You don't go for the ambiance (it's in a strip mall like setting) but you will love the food!"}
{"text":"Super yummy sushi. Went for a late lunch with my Mom. She ordered the sushi/sashimi combo and I ordered the sashimi bento plus an order of uni. All sushi was fresh but uni was just ok (hence the 4 stars - I  love uni).

Service was friendly and restaurant was clean. 

Will def come back."}
{"text":"Definitely a quiet place. We walked in at 5:30 and were seated next to the only other couple in an otherwise empty dining room. Slightly awkward but oh well, on to the sushi...

5pm-6pm is half off select rolls and well worth it. Ordered three separate rolls (Philly, Manhattan, and Hot Mama). All delicious. Our total was about 11 bucks. If you can make it at this hour I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered three rolls for take out recently: spicy tuna, green dragon and kanpai roll. I thought the quality was decent. I didn't have any complaints but wasn't blown away. I'm not saying size is equivalent to quality, but I found the rolls to be smaller than I've had elsewhere. 

I liked the level of heat in the spicy tuna roll and enjoyed the flavors and textures in the  kanpai roll.

I'll try it again, but until I do I'll stick with Mizu as my go to sushi joint."}
{"text":"Went at 5pm on a Saturday as a date night away from the kids. Have lived in the area for my whole life and never knew this place was here. We were the only customers but that was great to actually have some peace and quiet. Sushi was reasonably price and delicious. Monday through Thursday, they have half price happy hour from 5-6p. We'll definitely be coming back. Also received a delicious free dessert. Some type of a fried pastry."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this little suhsi place. It's tucked into a small strip mall so unless you are looking for it, you won't find it. Korean Chirasi was great, fresh and delicious. 
Definitely give this little place a try!"}
{"text":"This is a Tale of Two Sushi Restaurants - one serving fresh reasonably priced sushi lunch specials mid day, and one serving fresh but grossly overpriced and undersized items at dinner. The problem is....it's the same place. 
I've eaten lunch here probably 10 times over the last few years and was well pleased with the selection, price, portion size, and service. So when I was in the area overnight last night I decided to go here for dinner, and it was like being in an episode of 'Honey, I shrunk the sushi'. I couldn't believe how small the nigiri and rolls became after 5pm. The pricing for 4 single pieces of nigiri and one small roll came to $30. This isn't LA folks, it's Olmsted OH - my expense account can't take this. 
Moral of this tale - come here for lunch and find someplace else for dinner. 
Normally a review like this would merit 2 stars, but I've given it 3 because everything I've ever had here is fresh the the service is consistently prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"We were looking for a local sushi place this past Saturday and came upon Ohashi in the Yelp reviews.  Very good reviews so we decided to give it a try. 

It's just a tiny place in the Drug Mart strip on Lorain Rd.  Given it was a Saturday night, the parking lot was packed  from Fat Heads.  However, there was not an empty table inside Ohashi.  We decided to sit at the sushi bar and were well taken care of.  

I've been to many sushi places throughout the area and this place has some of the best rolls I have ever tried.  We had the West Side Cleveland Roll, Spider Roll and the Fire Mountain Roll.  All three were spectacular.  Reasonable price, no different than anywhere else.  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here, this time I got take out and it was still great when I got home!!! The waitresses are so friendly. I love the food. I got a shrimp tempura, spider roll and the sunflower tempura, all came out great!!! I recommend to everyone. A little pricey but good!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, but it is more expensive with smaller portions! Will go back at lunch and another round of dinner of course though."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place isn't more packed.  The only caveat it has is that service can be a bit slow but I'll wait for the best sushi in town, no problem.

Their fish is the freshest tasting I've found in this area.  I am consistently satisfied with everything I have here, and their menu (at least with the sushi) has some creative entries on it.

Specifics:

Everyone talks about the Super Dreamy roll.  Its description and appearance are both a bit odd but it is absolutely one of the best things ever.

The wide selection of rolls with spicy mayo (like Spicy Salmon and the Big Mouth roll) are a boon for any Sriracha fan.

If you like California rolls (yes, blasphemy in some people's eyes, but who cares) try their Sunflower roll

Anything with crab (Big Mouth roll, Spider roll, Yum Yum roll) means really fresh, good quality crab.  This is a big deal, as I have found out elsewhere when I've not liked crab because other places serve low quality crab meat.

And, when you are done, you can either get a brewsky at Fathead's nearby, go to the Great Northern Mall, or shop at the dinky asian grocery next door to fill up on bean-based dessert items.  Worth a trip (or several)."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh sashimi/sushi!! Better than Sushi Rock

The atmosphere is a little quiet and hidden in the back of a shopping plaza.  It's a small little restaurant with a few tables and a quaint little sushi bar.  It seems like a small mom and pop restaurant.  I like a louder and busier atmosphere. It's a Korean family that runs the Japanese restaurant.  

The sushi is soo fresh.  It doesn't have a fishy taste whatsoever- extremely fresh.  Get sashimi- you won't need any soy sauce or rice to eat with it.  It's delicious by itself.  The teriyaki salmon is one of my sister's favorites- with a nice crispy skin with a sweet and slightly tangy sauce, (personally, it's not the best I've had)  The side salad is like any other salad you can get an a Japanese restaurant with the ginger dressing.   Skip the Udon noodle soups, they are bland on flavor and I've had much better at Korean restaurants.  They also have a small selection of Japanese sodas and beer too.

It's a little on the pricey side, but well worth it for the freshness of the fish!"}
{"text":"Basically the mcdonalds of sushi. Bland, sad, bad texture, not good ingredients.

I had the edamame, spicy tuna, and fire mountain roll. The crunchy flakes on the fire mountain roll tasted like those edible packing peanuts."}
{"text":"Great sashimi, nice rolls horrible service & $$$ if I don't travel down town to Sushi 86 then I might order to go from here."}
{"text":"I am not sure how this place gets the rave reviews I see here. I've been twice (once for lunch and once for dinner). Despite being empty the service was sloooow. Got maki rolls both times and the rolls were very small, sloppily made, andtasteless/not tasty. Watery miso soup. I would grab Giant Eagle sushi over coming here again."}
{"text":"One of the very few sushi restaurants in the area. They are fast at filling an order and everything tasted fresh and very good. I had gotten a carry out and everything was taken care of as far as condiments and drink. I am from out of town here on business so that was nice after a long day."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch today.  The server was extremely nice, but the sushi was just...blah.  The rolls were expensive and lacked flavor, and the sashimi pieces were miniscule!  The next time I get a craving for sushi I will be making the drive to Pacific East."}
{"text":"Korean run Japanese restaurant.  Pretty good quality.  Thus, the food is not unexpectedly a little more Korean in character.  The Gyu-donburi is a lot more like Bulgolgi than a strictly typical Japanese Gyu-don.  Still, quality is good, and service rather friendly.

If you're feeling like Kimchi, the price is 4.00... not typical pan-chan prices.

Sushi is decent for the price."}
{"text":"Wow! Hidden gem to say the least! This place is truly amazing. My wife found it by accident and we came for a Saturday afternoon lunch. Both of us were VERY pleased. We'll definitely be back! Prices are really reasonable too. Huge plus."}
{"text":"The best kept sushi secret in Cleveland. I love this place... The quality is off the hook. Mon thru Thur is half price on selected menu items."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Sushi I have eaten in Ohio.  I can not wait to go back.  Bit pricey but very worth it.  Dinner can get expensive I think but we went for lunch."}
{"text":"So here's the problem, and my deliemma with this review......the sushi is really good......HOWEVER, we attempted to dine here at 8:25 pm on a Monday and we were told we could not dine in, but order take-out only.  No one was in the dining area, so I asked if there was a party coming in and they said, \"No, we are closing soon.\"

I asked what time they closed, and she said, \"9 pm\".

Over 30 minutes away from closing time, and they would not let you dine in, which is extremely odd.  I've worked in a restaurant before, and this is almost unheard of.

As the server is trying to show us a menu, a woman who seems like she could be the manager walks over and asks us what kind of rolls we were looking at on the menu.  My boyfriend tells her that he'd like to get some California Rolls.  She then tells us that they ran out of crabsticks.  Seriously, that's like running out of hamburgers at McDonalds.  I looked over and all of the sushi at the bar had been put away.  We were so appalled, we left.  I guess they did not want the business.

I will probably never eat here again, out of principle."}
{"text":"Very good sushi but small portions for the price. The Tokyo Rainbow was amazing and the Hot Mama was good too. I was not impressed with the Mustard Roll."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I recently moved back to the Cleveland area from Cincinnati and have been looking for some staple Cleveland sushi/ Asian restaurants. This place IS NOT one that we will ever bother returning to. Ohashi is Over priced, bland, and you get Small portions with barely any vegetables. I just feel so annoyed that, everything on the menu is so overpriced and I paid for it thinking it must be really good and have plenty for leftovers... No. If you like $16.00+ entrees of white rice and a few tempura shrimp/veggies then maybe you would be satisfied. Basic sushi roll ranges from $6-$8.00 for 6 measly pieces and literally only filled with crab and surrounded with rice, no veggies or toppings. The taste of the food was fine. But NOT worth it. I completely agree with the guy below who says this isn't LA people its North Olmsted Ohio."}
{"text":"This place has potential to be good. But the portion size and price does not match up. I paid 11 dollars for 5 pieces of sushi. And whatever you do, don't get the Philly roll. All you can taste is cream cheese. There are no other flavors to help. Grocery store sushi was better than what we got here. 

The most you get for each roll is 6 small pieces. I don't know about any of you, but even though sushi is a delicacy I still want to be able to savor and share my sushi with my friends and family. By the time we did that there was none left. 

I gave this 2 stars because at least the sushi \"looked\" pretty, even though we were incredibly disappointed for our $50 date night."}
{"text":"Decor is unassuming, but clean. The sushi is superb. The specialty rolls are probably the best I've had in Cleveland. The Super Dreamy Roll with the special house sauce might be the best roll I've ever had. Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The service here is incredible!  The sushi chef is very friendly and a seriously gifted artist in his craft.  It's always exciting to branch out and try something new at every visit.  The atmosphere is casual but the presentation of the food is like eating at a 5 star resturant. The quality of the fish is amazing!  M-F they have half price sushi rolls at a certain time.  Definitely try this place if your looking for a great place to eat and you love sushi and udon."}
{"text":"My sisters and I came in for some sushi before heading to the Cleveland Airport earlier this week.

The tuna and yellowtail nigiri didn't taste fresh. It may have been past the prime serving day. The salmon tasted fine. 

My sister ordered the tempura veggie ramen which she found to be very salty. 

Our waitress stared at us the whole time. We were one of three tables eating there. It felt creepy in a way but she was always around to help wait our table. 

Overall the food was so-so with longer than expected times to receive our order even with two sushi chefs at the bar. I have since struck out during this vacation."}
{"text":"Best kept secret on the west side! My hubby and I adore everything about Ohashi. Sushi is always yummy and fresh. The Super Dreamy Roll is to die for. There's nothing spectacular about the decor, but the ambiance is always relaxing and welcoming. We have brought our 1-year-old here on several occasions since she was tiny, and they are always so kind and patient with us. Plus, they have a bomb happy hour: pretty sure it's half-priced rolls every weekday from 5-6! AWESOME place!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Big portions. Two people, two sushi plates, two udon soups, and sake.... $70."}
{"text":"Liked this place a lot. Visiting Cleveland for work and being from the west coast, I was slightly weary of what the differences would be having sushi in Ohio. But it was delicious. Everything I got was so good, I came back and got it all again. Really great prices too. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've only gone during the happy hour special and I was surprised that they have changed the special.  It only includes rolls now, no sashimi.  The night I was there it took about 30+ minutes for our table of 2 to receive the order.  The food is still great, but when you have a packed dining room and only 1 chef that's just not going to cut it.  I will continue to go, but I don't know if it will be my #1 pick anymore with the limited happy hour special."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Ohashi. And this is Yelp--so let me tell you why! 

1) They're open on Mondays. I know that's a strange thing to say but many Cleveland-area Asian restaurants are closed Mondays--and for some strange reason, I crave sushi on that very day. 

2) Their rolls are THE PERFECT size for optimal flavor and consumption experience. Translation: not so dayum huge that I have to unhinge my jaw and chew for 8 years to eat them. I'm all about getting more bang for my buck, but not when it comes to compromising the delicate taste balance of a damn good sushi roll. Too much rice and it's no bueno. Too huge and I'm gnawing on single ingredients on one side of my mouth while the rest of the it squeezed into the cheek on the other side. Gross. 

3) Taste and selection. They have fresh fish and ingredients. Plus, they have special rolls that I would drive out of my way for (and I do.) 

My latest experience was a great one filled with Kani Su (imitation crab and avocado wrapped in thin sliced of cucumber, served in a rice wine vinaigrette) and properly prepared edamame to start. We then followed up with a lighter, special requested roll of tuna, avocado and cucumber. And indulged with their special Red Dragon and Fire Mountain rolls--both spicy and sinfully good. 

Overall I think their sushi is slightly over-priced, but that doesn't keep me from coming back for more. And now that some of our awesome Yelpers have clued me in to their happy hour prices, I think I might need to time my next visit juuuust right."}
{"text":"Great little restraunt. Really enjoyed the Super Dreamy Roll and their version of the Jackie Roll. Thanks andI will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for over 7 years I think. The Sushi is always very fresh and some of the lowest prices in town."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night...place was moderately busy. Service was friendly and relatively efficient. Food was okay...some items seemed frozen not fresh.  Portions were also on small side.  Still looking for quality sushi on west side."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland!  Don't let the unassuming location fool you.  This is the real thing.  Delicious, spicy and fresh sushi and sashimi made by a fantastic itamae.  

Entrees are available like Ton Katsu (crispy fried pork cutlet) or Chicken Teriyaki for sushi-phobes, but once they try the sushi, they'll be converts. 

Prices are incredible for the quality.  This is a real find that begs to be discovered."}
{"text":"The sushi tasted fresh but the rolls and sashimi are tiny and way overpriced. They skimped on the fish and toppings. I Will be going elsewhere for sushi in the future!"}
{"text":"This place has been one of my favorites for years. Very consistant.    Clean atmosphere and conformable.   Maybe could use new chairs.  But sushi is great. Also prices are good for Ohio.  All good here"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland. I love this little gem. Fast, friendly, good good food!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sushi fan, but sometimes I get the itch.  Al around some pretty good sushi; tastes fresh but admittedly I don't eat a lot of sushi so I don't have much to compare it to.  One complaint is their lack of veggie kinds of sushi.  I've been to other places which have many more options on that front.  I can't downgrade it that much though, I know sushi is mostly a meat-eater/fish domain so I'm the odd ball out ha ha.

Nice atmosphere as well!  I won't be bursting down the doors, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"From the outside, the place does not reflect the quality of food they actually serve. However, the service was very slow. The waitress might have thought we were waiting for another person. It only came over to our table once for food and drink orders maybe 15 minutes after we arrived. She was friendly though! We ordered one salmon meal, vegetable tempura, miso soup, some nigiri and 5 sushi rolls-some veggie, some fish. The vegetables were awesome and the soup was classic miso soup-just what we were looking for. The salmon meal was perfectly crisped on the outside and not dry on the inside with a small amount vegetables on the side. All the sushi we ordered was very good. It was fresh, rolled well, good flavor, presented well. The prices are a little higher than I'm used to for sushi at this level but I'm glad we found this place. 
The interior was clean and pleasant-don't met the outside fool you!"}
{"text":"I came here an a Saturday with my mom in the middle of our shopping excusion. Why settle for mall food when you could have sushi that's only 2 miles away? It's very clean and nicely decorated.

We decided to start off with miso soup with shrimp shumai. I highly recommend it! The delicate flavor of the miso complimented the flavorful shrimp shumai very nicely.

As for the sushi, we went with the Spider Roll and the Eel roll. The Spider roll was rather large with fried soft shell crab and masago. It was pretty average in taste. The Eel roll was a bit of a disappointment. The maki roll itself was pretty small and so it lacked in the eel-department. Most of the time if you order an eel maki roll you get a good portion of eel, possibly with eel on top. The taste itself was fine but I wish they had put more eel in.

Apart from being disappointed with the amount of eel in my Eel roll, I was also a bit disappointed by the number of pieces of the maki rolls, especially for the price. Now, the miso shumai soup was $4.50 each which is perfectly reasonable, especially with three shumai dumplings in it. On the other hand, the Spider Roll was $10.75 for 5 pieces. That seems like a bit much when the seafood portion of it isn't unique and it has fillers of lettuce and cucumber. The Eel roll was $7.00 for 6 very small pieces that lacked eel. 

Overall, this place is average and good if you're craving sushi but don't expect it to be the best sushi place you've come across."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I've ever had. Tried the Super Dreamy Roll and was blown away. I did carryout but was impressed by the cleanliness and charm of the place and I will definitely done in next time. Great place sp glad it's in North Olmsted!!!!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a run down hole in the wall from the outside. It is perfect inside. It's quiet, clean and quaint and the food is superb. Perfect date night."}
{"text":"Go for happy hour, 5-6 every weekday. I've been probably a half dozen times over the years and have never been disappointed. The place is quiet and the servers are so sweet. I kind of want one of their \"Eat Sushi at Ohashi\" shirts. I wish the wasabi had a bit more kick to it, but the sauces are flavorful. The mushroom miso soup is tasty too - the mushrooms are fresh, not slimy."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place in suburb Cleveland. The menu is simple but the seafood is fresh. The chef put just right enough sauce to the sushi. The only thing I don't like is the hardwood chair. My butt slightly hurt after a good meal. Make sure you asked for the cushion."}
{"text":"I went for happy hour when they offer half off of the common rolls. The specialty rolls are still normal price but you can get some of each and mix it up for a hot deal. 

Don't let the strip mall store front or the lack of atmosphere inside fool you, this place serves up some quality fish! I would even say that it's better than some of our more expensive hibachi places here in Sandusky. The fish was super fresh and the rolls were well made.

The only negatives I could say would be to maybe update the decor a bit and put more flare into the presentation itself. But these things wouldn't keep me away from such delicious offerings."}
{"text":"We arrived at 1pm on a Sunday. There was 1 couple there. We shared a hibachi table with them. We were there over an hour. No other customers came in during that time. The service was impeccable. The Hibachi show / cooking was typical, but not outstanding. But he was a very nice man. The waitress that took our orders and brought us drinks was wonderful, especially with my two children. They got balloons & drinks with lids. And she came by several times to see if they needed anything else. I would go again but I'm very curious as to why there were only two sets of customers there on a Sunday in the early afternoon, right after church, when most restaurants are swamped."}
{"text":"Very easy to find . It is in the fat heads and drug mart plaza.  The two ladies working was not too friendly .  I eat at a lot of japanese places.  This place is not good and the price is definitely to high for the quality .  They can't cut sushi either. The green tea tasted like hot water.  I hope they can get better service and serve better quality sushi .  My sushi didn't taste fresh.  The shrimp tempura roll was too thick with lettuce."}
{"text":"We love this place - it's the best sushi we've had on the west side and the service is very good. The Jackie Roll is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with friends for dinner one evening.  It is a bit hard to find because it is in a plaza tucked away. Parking was a bit full even though it was a weeknight because it is right by Discount Drug Mart. The service was good but the food was just okay. I got a spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and yellowtail rolls with a seaweed salad. I have had much better sushi at other places around Cleveland. Won't be on the top of my list to return."}
{"text":"This hidden gem of a restaurant took my wife and me by complete surprise, as it's tucked away within a strip mall. We weren't quite sure what to expect; however, this is arguably the best sushi that you can find in Cleveland. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quiet place, never crowded, hidden in the corner of a tiny strip mall behind Fatheads.  We go here for the bento box lunch special, which is never disappointing.  I usually sit at the table, but there's a sushi bar in back if you want to actually watch the sushi chef work."}
{"text":"I will echo a lot of the reviews - the sushi was great!! It was nice & quiet, so a great place to go so you can actually have a conversation without shouting! Yes, it's in a plaza setting, oh well - easy to find! We had the edamame appetizer, Salmon Sashimi, and two specialty sushi rolls - the West Clevelander sushi roll and the Futomaki roll - both excellent. A wine & a beer to go along with them & we were in heaven. And then we had the Mochi Ice Cream - very different, but we really liked it!!  Our dish had strawberry, green tea and mango flavors - try it!! Even if you think you hate Sushi, there's plenty of choices - even a Kentucky roll that has fried chicken in it!!"}
{"text":"Went to Ohashi for lunch today after reading good reviews on here for it. I was not disappointed. I had the Big Mouth Roll, yellowtail sashimi, and red snapper sashimi. The fish was very fresh and everything I had there was delicious. Maybe just a bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for. All in all, for an unassuming little restaurant in a shopping complex Ohashi was a wonderful surprise."}
{"text":"This place is so unassuming being tucked back in a plaza but don't be fooled, this is one of the best sushi places on the west side. Their fish is very fresh and their rolls are delicious. The price point is average, but come during happy hour for half off. This is our go to and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ohashi is a great find.  Tucked in behind a Drug Mart and Dairy Queen, it's not the place you'd except to find some of the best sushi in Cleveland, but don't be fooled, it is exceptional.

Every time I've gone I've never had to wait and the staff has always been great.  And on top of all that, the sushi is AMAZING.

Every roll I had here was high in quality and taste.  The place is fairly small and the sushi bar is too, giving your dinner experience a cozy feel that a lot of other sushi places can't compare with.

If you're looking for a more intimate, sushi dining experience this is the place to go.  It's quiet, peaceful, and even has its own t-shirts!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken katsu and it was very good.  The happy hour looks like it includes the standard sushi fare which is right. The price is a little high for what you end up getting if you aren't getting the 1/2 price rolls."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to get sushi in the Cleveland area! The rolls are delicious and super fresh. Their teriyaki and cooked meals are great as well. Always looking forward to my next visit to Ohashi."}
{"text":"After trying their Tempura Udon soup I'll have to up my rating of Ohashi. This soup is super rich and delicious and I can't get enough of it. Still not giving them a 5 star rating because I still think their sushi is way over priced for how much you get."}
{"text":"I would never have known this restaurant existed if not for Yelp - it is tucked back into a small shopping plaza away from the main road. 

We grabbed some carryout on a Saturday night, and thought the sushi was really good. They had a few veg options for me and my husband tried a couple of unique rolls. 

I thought the rolls were on the smaller side, so that was slightly disappointing. 

It is a cute and cozy little place that would be good for meeting friends - everyone working was really friendly too. We would try it again."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and great and their happy hour is terrific (half off select sushi) but the service is severely lacking. I'll definitely come back again since it was so delicious, hopefully the service is better. Place is hard to find though if you don't know where to turn but it is behind Fat Head's."}
{"text":"Finally found, not a good, but an amazing sushi place in Cleveland !!!!! Great service, obviously family run but SPOTLESS! The prices are wonderful and they got plenty of options for you people who don't like sushi :) I'm going to be coming back again and again for sure !!! Thank you guys !"}
{"text":"I have been to some of the top sushi places in the NYC, LA, Vegas, etc. Ohashi is the best sushi I have ever had. Period. The sushi chef is a master of his craft and between his artistry and the rest of the staff's friendliness, your meal at Ohashi will not disappoint. One big bonus... Every Monday-Thursday from 5-6pm they have 1/2 price sushi!!! No joke. Best sushi you will have in Cleveland for sure."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh. Service was slow. Rolls were small. If we're being honest here. While I would go back if invited, I won't be rushing over there for another bite on my own."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place. The staff is friendly, including the owner, Jackie. The special rolls can be pricey, but they're artwork and taste amazing!"}
{"text":"Domo arigato, Ohashi! If you're coming here *just* for sushi, oh man are you totally missing out! I love me some sushi, don't get me wrong, but I think it's largely a fad and nowhere near representative of the true delicacies of Japanese cuisine.  If you want to really explore how amazing and flavorful Japanese food is and get a truly umami experience - order off the non-sushi menu for some delicious Japanese soul-food. [yes Japanese Soul-food is totally a thing].  
 
My favorite dishes here that I've tried so far are the Tonkatsu and the Shrimp Tempura - both absolutely perfect.  The Pork Tonkatsu is a perfect iteration of that dish - thin pork cutlets, dredged in Japanese panko breadcrumbs, fried, and served with delicious Tonkatsu sauce - an incredibly hearty and satisfying culinary experience.  The Shrimp Tempura is just as good and is fried to airy-light-crispy perfect; a very hard feat to achieve.  It's also served with tempura vegetables as well, which were all fantastic.

In addition, they serve great sake and Asian beer as the perfect accompaniment to your [non-sushi] mean.  The staff is also very friendly, nice, and attentive.

Again, Ohashi is seriously amazing - whether your a lover of all things Japanese, like me, or are looking for a new culinary experience, you 'll be very pleased!"}
{"text":"They have uni which is hard to find anymore. The salmon nigiri was decent, two pieces per order. 
Sushi chef did not want to be bothered with social customers. Harumf The rest of the staff was plenty friendly to make up for Mr. standoffish"}
{"text":"The grandkids wanted sushi, I didn't feel like dealing with Crocker Park traffic, so we tried Ohashi take out tonight.

The rolls were good,  but not great. The biggest disappointment was the size of the rolls. For the price and quality of the food, Vieng's is far superior."}
{"text":"Note: I have only gotten carry-out  from Ohashi.

still worth leaving 5 stars. The sushi was really delicious. Although I didn't eat it for about 35 minutes after I picked it up, the sushi was still in tact and fresh. Often times, the rice becomes crumbly if it sits but that was not the case.

My sushi was ready moments after I got to the restaurant and the price was very comparable. We'll definitely be back to dine in."}
{"text":"The super dreamy roll is hands down best roll I've ever had! I went with a friend but am now taking my boyfriend to experience it for himself! I hope he likes this place as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Cleveland Metro Area--hands down. I have been all over Cleveland and the best I've found is 'okay' sushi--even at some of the places that Clevelanders rave about. But every time I come here I know I'm going to be happy and get a really good product.

I think I've maybe ordered 15-20 of their rolls now. I've found my favorites though and I tend to stick to these: philly, pretty woman, red dragon and the coma roll. The Philly--while found elsewhere, is especially good here. And the Coma roll is to die for--oh my goodness.

I've also had their tempura and gyoza here and those are really well done. One of my dining companions said it was the best tempura he's ever had--and with a couple exceptions in California, I agree. 

You will not be disappointed if you come here. It has my stamp of approval! (For however much that is worth...)"}
{"text":"As always, this was a great dinner. One of my favorite sushi places. Quiet, I've never had to wait for a table, and the sushi is excellent.
Today we started with edamame, my favorite starter at sushi restaurants. Just the right amount of salt and not too mushy. Very good. 
We shared two spicy tuna rolls, one Alaska roll, one yellow-tail tuna roll, a green dragon roll, and one of the newer \"fancy\" rolls - it was 5 kinds of fish and wrapped in radish. (I can't remember the name of the roll). The fancy roll was very fresh tasting and the radish wrap gave it a nice interesting texture. Dragon roll was good, I love eel. Spicy tuna was on point, just enough spice to keep it interesting, also very fresh tasting.
So, although this place is in kind of a strange spot, I definitely recommend you check it out!"}
