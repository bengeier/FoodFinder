{"text":"Try lunch special!  First, deco really cool and cozy.  Second, Service, we were there for lunch, above average, our serve is kinda busy, but very nice to us.  Third, food, I have to say so far is the best fine dinning place in Calgary. We had one lunch special for roast beef, Bravo! And a whole fish! The fish is good but not excellent not as perfect as the beef!  We have to point out that the french fries is a must try! The reason is the house special source is outstanding! It is very unique ketchup! super nice!  Overall, We will come back!  Although it is not enough to be a Michelin star restaurant, but it worth a Michelin Bib Gourmand lever restaurant.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"CHARCUT never disappoints. Their lunch combos are fabulous - soup, fries, cookies to go and a sandwich or roast meet for $15 or $25, respectively. The duck fat Poutine is amazing, a must-try. Reserve in advance, as this place is almost always full."}
{"text":"oh man, the half board of charcuterie is a must-try. it is plenty for 2-3 people to share. love the mortadella - i normally don't care for the baloney-type mortadella, the mortadella at charcut tastes like a fine slice of charcuterie. the homemade mustard is also great. i had their snails and marrow plate, which i'd never had in this combination, and it was great. i would definitely come back to this place next time i'm in calgary."}
{"text":"I took a friend of mine from Ontario here for his birthday while he was in town for work.  The service was spot on - our waitress, was fun and polite and did not hover our hound us.  She saw our drinks were low and would ask if we wanted refills.    The food was exquisite - words fail to describe the deliciousness of the marriage of flavours that we experienced.  So much so, that we came back the following night for a repeat, even though the menu does change.  It is easy to see why this is a Calgary favourite and a must try for anyone coming to or living in Calgary."}
{"text":"I had high hopes that it was fine dining, from the website it looks as though you should prepare to enjoy a fine evening.  I am always disappointed when I dress up and arrive at a location where people are wearing t-shirts and jeans, and while I realize jeans can be expensive they do not add to the ambiance. However, when seated at the table you are given a tea towel as a napkin so really I think I misjudged the atmosphere. All in all if I had someone who was on the Atkins diet this is the place I would recommend. If I knew someone working downtown who wanted a pint and something to nibble on I may recommend. I would not recommend this to someone looking for a full meal supper- its far to difficult to navigate the menu and it is far from cost effective. As you can see we ended up with a mix of items leaving us far from content but again it was an experience. Cocktail $13 Wine $9 Pretzel (2 sticks) $8 Charcut board (no veggies no bread thin sliced meat) $36 Poutine $8 Bread $16 Brulee $8 I also have to agree with Emma G, parking was not easy and put me in a foul mood. Thus I didn't write the review for 1 week so that it would not sway my true experience. I sincerely hope this helps someone in their selection."}
{"text":"This is probably at least the 10th time we've been to Charcut. It's our 'go to' place for a celebration or a nice meal out. All the times we've been previous, the food has been superb. We did have one visit, maybe 2 years ago, where the service was terrible, but that was dealt with and hasn't occurred since.   Well, last night the service was good. She was attentive without being intrusive.  The restaurant itself is rather noisy - probably more so due to where we were seated so keep this in mind if you expect to converse much. The sad part though, to our surprise and chagrin, the food was rather poor for the first time ever! Is this because both John and Connie have been away for awhile? (Gathered from their twitter feed). The poutine we got (which we normally LOVE) was a soupy mess of gravy. Not the usual for sure - by the time we got even a quarter way through, the fries were a soppy blob. We also ordered a side which was grilled zucchini with feta and pumpkin seeds. A couple of the zucchini wedges were charred absolutely black and were like charcoal. I couldn't believe that would even leave the pass that way. We also had the charcuterie board (another standard for us) and while the mortadella and the hot sausage (whatever it was - who could hear when the waiter explained it) were up to their usual tasty standards, the sausage was dry and much too chewy for our liking. Another type of sausage on the platter, our guest called \"a cowboy toothpick\" - it was that dry and sinewy. Also, I'm pretty sure all our previous boards had a few crostini on it to enjoy with the meats and mustard - not anymore. And a minor quibble but kind of interesting none the less - the menu format has changed. It's on a glossy, thick paper now that feels a lot less homey than the old paper one did. They even dumbed things down - the yummy raclette cheese appetizer they had is now called \"melted cheese\". Not sure I get it...  Honestly, for what we paid and for what we've experienced here in the past - this just wasn't worth it. We had a first-timer as our guest and were kind of embarrassed that we've raved about this in the past. I hate to say it, but I think it might be time to branch out and find a new place for our special nights out. Charcut, you broke our hearts!"}
{"text":"This is my fave restaurant in Canada right now.  It's a smart room with very good service and exceptional food.  Connie, Canada's \"Top Chef\" is an absolute sweetheart who often comes to the tables to check on everyone and get feedback.  She cares, and it shows in the food. I've had almost everything on the menu now, but I highly recommend the butcher steak, the pork belly and the aged blue cheese with wine injected.  I dream about this place. HUGE added bonus: almost everything on the menu is gluten free.  They even have gluten free bread for the meats and cheeses. One small negative: there is only one dessert that is gluten free (tough I know).  When I mentioned this to Connie one night, she made me a cherries jubilee (not on the menu) from scratch.. for free. Love love love this place.  Go tonight."}
{"text":"First of all, let me state, as a disclaimer, that I'm a pseudo fan of the Top Chef series. We had dined prior to the airing of the show and, subsequently, after. I actually found Connie to be sort of awkward and neurotic, sometimes difficult to root for and watch on the show. That, however, did not impact my taste buds' impartiality whilst there. Situated in a chic beautiful boutique hotel (thank you Montreal hotelier!), the room is groovy and uber hip. Service was good and attentive. The flat iron steak was Alberta beef worthy, tender, juicy, and spiced appropriately. The Charcut board had a nice array of tasty morsels. Duck fat poutine, you can't go wrong with duck fat! An innovative menu that should be sampled and applauded often."}
{"text":"I ordered 8 oz Prime Rib I Thought and told it would be 3/4 inch thick. It was 1/3 inch. About the size of ham steak at grocery store. Onion rings in old grease and under xooked.   Yucky."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Charcut more than 3 stars for my visit...  but the more I pushed \"expectations\" and \"reputation\" out of the equation, I couldn't have upped the rating and still have been honest with myself (this was my first visit, BTW).    For all the praise heaped on Charcut, I think I must have hit it on an off day.   The restaurant was only batting .500 on this Friday.    We had stopped in for a \"business lunch,\" and ordered the two \"lunch all at once\" options.  They were a BBQ beef sandwich, and a thinly sliced, roasted pork, respectively.  The beef was deemed \"excellent\" by my lunch mate.    My pork?  Well, not so much.   I think part of the issue was it WAS a later lunch, with our food being ordered around 12:45 - 1:00.    With the lunch rush tailing off, and perhaps \"remnants\" being used up, a good percentage of my pork was just fatty ends.   Some people chew fat down because \"that's where the flavour is\" (to quote someone I know).  But not me.      To be honest, when I trimmed away the fat, as I always do, those excluded pieces took up about half the plate I started with.   Not much left to eat, really.  And what was there, I found particularly and unusually salty.    As well, our waiter seemed to also be checking out after the lunch rush  -- he brought one drink late, and forgot the other drink order altogether -- until he brought the bill (at which point he remembered, and then apologized for his mistake).     So, as I said:  batting .500.  One meal was outstanding, one not.   3 stars:  middle of the pack.  No more."}
{"text":"Being a tourist from a big city, eating here was quite delightful. It definitely helped to eat good food for having been stuck in an airport for over 8hrs.  Nice to see something open after 6pm on a Saturday night.  Onto my review.  I went with my fianc√© and first shared the mortadella and the poutine to share.  The mortadella was plentiful and very good.  Unfortunately, it didn't come with comp bread, just the meat. We eventually ordered rye bread (forgive me we have never ordered a meat platter).  The poutine was very good (I would order this alone). It was perfectly seasoned but the quantity was so small compared to the mortadella, lol.  We didn't finish the bread or meat, but it made a good breakfast the next morning.  For the main course, I ordered the prime rib and she ordered the butchers steak. Her dinner tasted much better than mine. I thought the prime was ok, wasn't terrible but wasn't the best I had either. The au jeux lacked in flavour (kind of watered down), but having the small dish of salt helped. Otherwise, the prime was like any other piece of prime. The butchers steak was cooked perfectly, and the pesto sauce was the perfect flavour too.   We never ordered dessert as we were both stuffed. But we were told how amazing the desserts are, oh wells."}
{"text":"Best meal in Calgary! Must stop by when in town; these folks clearly love food and they expertly crafted each dish. Can't recommend them enough, service was outstanding, the dining room is modern classy yet intimate, and even if you are a \"table for one\" like I was, sitting at the kitchen bar counter gets you in the middle of the action. you can see all the dishes that go out, and even maybe strike up a convo with their head chef and owner (like I did!). Plus they gave out so many complimentary dishes from the chef, it really makes you feel appreciated and shows how much they enjoy sharing their great food and culinary talents."}
{"text":"Our server, Zach, had the nerve (for shame!!!) to serve us Pinot Noir in a Cabernet glass. If only he could have served us our wine in the correct glass, I'd certainly be providing a 4.5 star review.  That being said, it is senseless that this restaurant was excluded from many of Calgary's top 10 lists. Beet salad to die for (weird, hey?), charcut board is a must, and if you avoid the pig's head mortadella, you're a fool.  P.S. thanks for the great service Zach!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit for lunch. The food is absolutely delicious, you eat and can be on your way in under an hour (they promise that on the menu :) ) and the service is superb.  It is quite a small place so you need to make reservations at least 3 days in advance. If it is for a large group then even longer, but trust me! It is all worth it."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday (Aug 8) and liked the atmosphere from the get go. Restaurant was busy so I sat along the kitchen bar top which was actually a nice spot. Be sure to get reservations. The \"Bottom Strip\" was the special and I enjoyed it... cooked rare requested. I will be going there again on Friday to continue sampling the menu."}
{"text":"Two words: Alley Burgers  You heard me.  Imagine a burger made from CHARCUT's high-quality, locally-sourced and completely ground in-house, grade-A beef, with a pickle on the side.  All for the measly price of $5.  But the only way you can get these delectable delights is from the restaurant's back entrance, and only then by purchasing them from one of the restaurant's co-owners himself.  But alas, the appearance of these mythical burgers are quite random, and the only way you know for sure if they're being offered is if they announce them (usually the day-of) through one of their social networks.  You know it's Alley Burger night if you see a bunch of random strangers huddled together near the restaurant's back door waiting in anticipation for it to open, and you know they're taking down orders when the Pig shaped sign is set to \"OPEN\" (I kid you not).  The randomness and limited availability doesn't stop most people from making their way down to sample them though.  Last time I was there, there was a person who drove down all the way from Dalhousie (and missed the last one by about 3 minutes), and a local Calgary couple dragged down some of their visiting relatives from Edmonton once they heard they were being served that night.  Many employees from neighboring and competing restaurants have been known to sneak off of work to sample CHARCUT's Alley Burgers as well.  They only make a limited number of these burgers when they decide to do this, and it can range from anywhere between 10-25.  Once they're gone, they're gone.  It's a neat little underground thing that they do for Calgary, and just when you think you've gotten the schedule down, they throw a curve ball at you and change it up, so you have to be diligent in keeping an eye out for it.  It's a neat experience to try for sure, and if you ever get the opportunity, you should go.  You never know who you'll run into, and the owners are always friendly and approachable.  The food menu is not too bad as well, although I only visited for coffee and dessert.  I'll write another review when I've had a chance to sample their normal offerings."}
{"text":"Well we got there about 45 minutes early, hoping to catch some of the game at the bar and enjoy some drinks before our reservation. The bar was full so we went to the lounge in the hotel. It was okay but not set up for watching hockey, but that's not really their goal I'm sure.  They came to get us when our table was free and so we settled up and went over. The food was DELICIOUS,  To start, we ordered the smoked heirloom beets with the homemade goat cheese, and the baked Quebec Raclette cheese.  Both were amazing. The cheese was a small portion for the price and I just love cheese in general that I don't think I appreciated the type of cheese enough to order it again for that price, but it was good! The heirloom beets were like no other beets I've ever tried. These were light in flavour but delicious, the goat cheese was very mild and soft, overall wonderful!  By the way, the main courses that are ordered are mainly a protein or general main and you are intended to order a side aswell since the main courses aren't served with them.  For main courses we ordered the butcher steak, which on that night the cut was a skirt steak, and we also ordered the pappardelle with clams. The steak was TO. DIE. FOR. It was cooked perfect, and I mean perfect. Served with the most amazing chimichurri I've ever eaten. It was so light and I was scraping up any morsel possible into my mouth. The pasta was also good, a very light sauce and the clams were cooked nicely. I probably wouldn't order it again but only because I want to try so much more on the menu, and there's no way I'm going back without ordering that steak again.   For a side we HAD to order the poutine. It was the only greasy feeling thing we had all night and it was good! Very unique tasting and absolutely delicious. For dessert we had the Top Chef item, I can't remember the name, but I will update. Also wonderful.  For all that, and 4 drinks, our bill was not ridiculously expensive, although I was worried when we finished ordering, but very reasonable. We left feeling full but not heavy or bloated. It was the perfect meal served by great staff. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"In my opinion it's 3.5 stars worth of good. The food was amazing. We had the new york strip for 2, oysters, bread with melted cheese and poutine. Everything was well done and delicious. I wouldn't order the bread and cheese again though, I just don't feel it's enough to justify the 16$ spent (4 small brioche buns and a small pot of melted cheese.) However the steak, poutine and oysters I would return for. We have plans to return for the meat and cheese board. So why just 3.5? The service was very off-putting. We waited so long for drinks to be brought first of all. Like 20 minutes. Each time. There was a lot of strange laughing from our waitress, she seemed so anxious it made me anxious. Also I felt like the bathrooms and ambiance did not meet my expectations for spending 200 on a 2 person meal. So, I would go again, but just for a drink and some lunch, I would not go all out on a dinner here.  Just another thought, I'm all for a small menu done well but think this is on the extreme side of small. To the point that I wouldn't have ordered an entree if my boyfriend didn't really want steak and the one he wanted (out of 2) was an entree for 2. I was looking forward to escargot and bone marrow and it was taken from the menu which was a bummer."}
{"text":"Overall, food was pretty good. For starters we shared beet salad(where the goat chease tasted moslty like cream cheese, making the whole thing bland), the charred octopus(which was delicious, with the sausage and the two tomatoe sauce, making it the best meal of the whole experience), and the conserva tuna, which was very interesting, a good balance of sour and charred flavor.   We then shared the steak and chimichurri, which was worth the price without being crazy. The poutine, delicious though made very oily by the truffle oil. And the duck fat fried brussel sprouts, that were very flavorful though getting sour towards the end... Maybe too much vinegar. And we ended the meal with a very nice lemon tart, accompanied by a bland mascarpone ice cream(would have required something more.)   The service was nicely timed, never too fast, goving us time to drink the bottle of wine we got.   Though the waiter was explaining every meal to the last ingredient, sounding a bit akward, and even annoying at some point. Making sure he was the first to tell us about the plate, even if another waiter was serving it. He also made it clear he thought our choice of food was insufficent and made us weirdly uncomfortable.   I'm still giving 4 stars because the experience of a restaurant is not only about the service, and we got to give some credit to the guys in the kitchen, doing an amazing job."}
{"text":"Delicious food & great wine and charges are reasonable, although the place can a bit loud but overall a great place to eat. Will visit them again."}
{"text":"The drinks are well made and balanced; very unique in flavors.   If you are a meat lover, the cured meat platter is absolutely a must try. The meats are original and well seasoned.   If you are a dessert lover and have a really sweet tooth, try the chocolate tart. You can tell it is made from quality chocolate, however it was a bit too rich and the shell was a little too tough for me. The grilled fruits were nice, it was on the lighter side and not overly sweet.  The service was awesome. We were also lucky to get a chance to chat with Connie, she's very sweet and down to earth."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever! Don't waste your time or money! We had planned our anniversary dinner here, big mistake! We even had flowers sent. Service was even worse than the food!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and presentation. The cauliflower / salmon soup was stupendous!!"}
{"text":"Charcut is amazing. I have never been so impressed by simple, but delicious food! Everything we tried made me want to cry out of pure joy. The pork is to die for, the salad is amazing, and the burger is a must!   I aso go there just to order the cheesecake in a jar. The berry reduction reminds me of my grandma's jam and has the most amazing, creamy rich flavour. Order it. Trust me."}
{"text":"Moved back to Calgary from New York this summer and had been waiting for one a food moment. Today's lunch chicken sandwich was that moment. Delicious, priced well, came with this strange pickled carrot which changed my views for the better on the vegetable."}
{"text":"The food was superb. All the meats were top quality. The poutine and veggie sides were also amazing.   Complaint: the atmosphere is what didn't do it for me. It was so loud and I felt like I was wide out in the open. It wasn't quaint at all and so that's what really didn't make the experience for me."}
{"text":"We went there for my husband's BD after I read a good review about this restaurant on Avenue magazine.I order pasta and my husband ordered Quarter of Chicken and we also ordered a bottle of sparkling wine which was very expensive to celebrate. Pasta was very good. The chicken was just okay nothing special. But the real problem was that one of the servers who happened to be the greeting person as well was coughing constantly for 1 hour that we were at the restaurant. I almost felt like I am at the hospital rather than at the restaurant Our table was against the wall close to the entrance door and she was on the other side of the wall very close to our table. She was coughing all the time and when she was walking through the lounge area to the kitchen and out she was coughing constantly. It was very disturbing. you don't expect to see a coughing server in a fast food let alone in a fancy, expensive restaurant. I let my server know that we are not feeling comfortable and she let (I guess) the manager know. but all they did was to apologize which I think is not remotely good enough. They should not let a sick server be in the restaurant serving people and spread germs. people go to fancy restaurant and pay lots of money to eat good food and get relax not to get sick!!!"}
{"text":"Finally another new restaurant in Calgary the likes of Rush which is doing it's best to put Calgary on the food map. Almost everything is sourced local as possible and made in house. The care they take with sourcing the ingredients is not diminished at all during the preparation of the final product.   We sat at the best table, in my opinion, at the food bar overlooking the kitchen during Dine Out Calgary week. Everything on the menu looked so good we couldn't just have the three course set menu. Instead we splurged (well not really when we got the final bill) and ordered up seven courses between the two of us. They were:   1. Warm unique olives in a orange peel infused olive oil - very good tasting olives without the tang you get with other strong olives, I wished there was a little bread to soak up the delicious oil though. 2. Pigs head mordadella - yes an actual pork head stuffed with pistachios, meat and truffles sliced paper thin. This was a great appetizer and the mustard was not extra strong which worked beautifully with the pork.  3. Smoked, roasted sliced organic beef - they have a rotisserie over the grill that roasts chicken and the beef on a spit. The smokiness of the beef was just right and not overpowering like it could been in a BBQ house. It maybe could have used a little more of the delicious dripping that they were collecting but other than that it was a hit.  4. Pink leg of lamb over white lima beans - the caper and parsley sauce that the beans and lamb were floating in were so good I'd inject it directly into my veins if it was possible. Lamb was nicely pink, very tender and I think it was sous vide.  5. Duck fat deep fried poutine - thick potato fries in gravy with cheese. This was probably the weakest dish to me but only because everything else was so excellent so far. The fries could probably benefit from being double/triple cooked. They were very potatoey in flavour but a little dry and the gravy could have used a little more seasoning to balance out the thick fries. Saying all this, I'd still wolf down an order in an instant next time. They were super accommodating too as the other half couldn't have the gravy due to the wheat they used so they gave us an additional order of fries with grated cheese. 6. Homemade chocolate cookies - this normally comes with a vanilla milkshake but I was so full (and I can always get my money's worth in a buffet...) that we just got the cookies to go in a box and skipped the milkshake. It did look good though as we saw a few orders go out.  7. Blue cheese with homemade apple jam, walnuts and a preserved apple. Apparently the apples come from Connie's parents backyard in Calgary so you can't really get more local than that. I'm not a fan of blue cheese but the other half said it was divine. The apples were extremely good though.   They also have a Natura system there that produces their own sparkling and still water. Very good for the environment and it does taste very good.   All this for under $100 for the two of us before tip. Mind you we didn't partake in any alcohol or drinks but still great bang for the buck for the quality. Since it was Dine Out week and it was packed for a Wed, the service was not as attentive as you would find in Rush but everyone was polite and friendly.   I'm going back soon to try out their burger or flatiron steak, both looked absolutely incredible.  Hopefully I can control myself and leave a little more room for dessert too!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Charcut for dinner because of the good reviews on Yelp. I ordered 10oz of the Prime Rib @ $4.50/oz. It was very fatty & extremely chewy. No sides, as they were extra.  The Butcher steak is actually bottom sirloin. No sirloin, top sirloin or filet mignon on the menu. Disappointing for a steak place.  The burger is $2.80/Oz. Pretty expensive for a burger considering  no sides are included.  The fish -not on the menu since it was the daily special- was excellent.  Poutine is not bad for something that is outside of Montreal... but at $12, left to be desired.   The bill for 3 people was $275 (included a bottle of wine)."}
{"text":"Rating would be much higher if the steak wasn't $90.  We were out for a special occasion and money isn't the issue but I am big on value for dollar.  The steak is offered as bone-in New York-$45 per person with a minimum of 2 people.  It was good but $90? Really! and you had to order the sides/potatoes separately.  We also had the whole fish which was great and only $25-$30.  With other foods, etc. our group of 4 had 4 beers and 1 bottle of wine and the bill was $375 with tip.    Charcut is trendy/busy.  The food is all very tasty and the family style sharing is fun.  Our service was fine, the ambiance is nice but I doubt I will go back based on $$.  Calgary just has better options at that price point."}
{"text":"We are big fans of this place after following chef Connie De Souza on Top Chef Canada.  We really enjoy the range of dishes available on the menu. The poutine is my favorite, by far.  Charcut provides top-quality food prepared by well-trained chefs who know what they are doing.  We found the food to be a bit on the heavy side, but it's a steak house, after all. You won't leave hungry, that is for sure. Overall, excellent quality."}
{"text":"In Calgary the night before a flight out we stumbled on Charcut without a reservation on a thurs night and ended up at the dining bar overlooking the open kitchen. This was one of the most delicious and entertaining dining experiences in memory. The menu is all about fresh... Inspired simple food and absolutely fabulous service. Sit at the dining bar. It is an experience to watch genius at work. Definitely lives up to the buzz."}
{"text":"The service appeared slow but I was still in and out in 45 minutes - love that.   I expected a $15 lunch special in a fancy restaurant to be stingy but halfway through the meal, I was stuffed and slumped over my chair.   I did find my sandwich a bit too greasy and it was hard to figure out if I needed to pick it up or attack it with a fork and knife. Still the focaccia was soft and the meat well spiced. This meal was fabulous for the price."}
{"text":"Solid lunch special, underwhelming and expensive dinner.  First, I will admit that I am a Top Chef nut. That meant I had very high expectations for Charcut.   My first trip was for dinner with friends and we ended up sharing every dish. - Charcut Board: While the selection of meats was tasty, at $36 it was quite steep as Taste Restaurant has a similar tasting platter for $22 - Shareburger: The meat was tasty but overall again, not great value. At $2.50 per ounce and a minimum of 9oz. you are looking at ~$23. In comparison Craft Beer Market has 16oz of equally tasty burger for $22 in their 20 napkin burger - Butcher Steak: Thankfully, there was some reprieve with the steak. While definitely not the finest cut of beef in the world, butcher's steak is flavorful and has a different texture than your more common steak cuts. It was well seasoned and prepared. - Duck fat fried poutine: I cant even believe I am typing this but I didn't really like the poutine. Usually the combination of fries, cheese and gravy makes my day but there was not much of a wow factor with this dish. The duck fat might have made the fries slightly better than average but I have probably had comparable at New York fries - Cheese platter: Delicious. Normally I am not a fan of cheese on its own but the selection was creative and the honey and nuts that accompany it were a perfect pairing.  Along with some other odds and ends dishes and 1 drink per person, dinner was over $60 per person. Pretty steep for a mediocre meal.  Now onto lunch, a much more pleasant experience. Had the Charcut lunch and was blown away. The soup, sandwich and most importantly the home made cookies restored my faith in both Charcut and in TV. For $15, you received a meal that makes for a great Friday lunch. They even have a small patio which is great for people watching during Calgary's minimal summer.   In conclusion, the cookies alone are worth the price of lunch but I don't see myself heading back for dinner.   9/30"}
{"text":"Went To Char Cut Last Night Started out great but went downhill from there. We had appetizers Shrimp cocktail weren't bad but overpriced; next had the salad which was tasty. My entree consisted of 7oz steak $28.00 ; the Argentina sauce was overwhelming and very salty which killed any taste of the steak.The manger came to our table and inquired about our meals and I informed her the meal was too salty and tasteless fom the sauce  .She replaced it with the prime rib which also had a different sauce that spoiled the flavor .It's not up to par with the steak houses I've frequented."}
{"text":"Probably one of my all time favourite places to go. Their I house cured meats are amazing and the bartenders are impressive. I have never ordered a drink I didn't like."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and both times the food was great. Prime rib always perfect, and the cookies are worth driving across town for!"}
{"text":"I was excited to go to Charcut because of Chef De Sousa but left w/ mixed feelings. The ribeye was tender but not spectacular and was served on a brown or black cutting board that made the whole thing look dark, the au jus was ok but the asparagus was wilted and greasy. One review recommended the pork belly and my wife ordered it. To her disappointment it was cold and the the top skin really soft. Typically pork belly has a moist meat and a crunch on the skin but this one didn't have it. The \"risotto\" I can live without. The texture was mushy and the taste bland. Overall, try it because its one of the few restaurants in Calgary that has that energetic ambiance and the servers pleasant and attentive. Food is not the same level as Notable, Rouge, or Brava."}
{"text":"I had a lunch meeting here recently - it was quite noisy, but the food made up for it for sure. The menu is very pork focused and it was delicisous. I had one of their 45 minute meals which included a salad, fries and roasted garlic with the daily routisserie. On the side, there is a brown paper bag with two delicious little morcels of chocolate chip cookie goodness for dessert. Can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"BIG TASTE 2016  Dropped in for their big taste lunch on a weekday. I was a little disappointed to find out that they had not prepared a separate special menu for the event - the lunch menu featured is actually on their regular menu under \"lunch all at once\".   The soup & sandwich change daily - we had some sort of spicy soup with a roast beef sandwich. Soup was a little too spicy, sandwich was yummy! My mom however had issues eating hers because we added mushroom & swiss - it was just waaayyy too big & she kind of had to take it apart and eat it with a knife & fork - bummer. We were not given salad as an option for the fries (let's not pretend like none of us are dieting comon ppl summer is coming soon) & no ketchup.. Just sweet chili sauce. Who dips their fries in sweet chili sauce???   Overall, we still had a good time. If you're downtown during lunch hours, it's a great little spot to grab something somewhat fancy at a great price. The portion was quite large for all of us & VERY filling. So bring your appetite!  The bag of warm cookies was definitely the highlight of my lunch =) so yums & easy to take home too."}
{"text":"The notoriety of Top Chef and EnRoute magazine drew me to this place. I like the chef's philosophy on food simple, fresh, from scratch. The pork croquettes was as good as I \"tasted\" it when I watched the show. The bone marrow did not disappoint.   I am also a believer that out of the respect for the animals, who become food on our plates, to not waste any part of it. It is refreshing to see a non-asian restaurant finally offering bone marrow in Calgary. A St John like restaurant in Calgary may not be far behind? lol"}
{"text":"If you're like me you have a huge appetite and can't eat food unless there's some form of meat. Now multiply that by three and you have last Sunday's setup - three female athletes with a voracious appetite for good eats and good conversation.   We opted to share a number of dishes including the bison salami, the ever amazing truffle fries cooked in duck fat, the share burger (who can say no to a perfectly fried egg?) and lonzino, which are Italian style bar snacks reminiscent of a pork jerky. Needless to say all the food was amazing. My only complaint, and I have to dig deep for this, is that some of the fare can be on the salty side.   We ended the night on a very high, very indulgent note with one dessert each. Cheesecake, milk chocolate parfait with caramel and ovaltine crunch and a pie topped with ice cream. There are no words. Simply go. Eat. Enjoy. Just try not to forget the time and stay until closing like we did."}
{"text":"Whether lunch or dinner, Charcut consistently delivers on great service, tasty food and amazing value.  My dining partner and I ordered their $15 lunch special which was a bowl of curried cauliflower soup, a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich, parmesan fries and some cookies for take away. Everything, save the fries were excellent.  The cookies were a nice treat at about 3:00 pm when a little sugar rush was in order.  I remember first experiencing Charcut before they opened at the Rocky Mountain Food and Wine festival back in 2009 - http://r4nt.com/article/rocky-mountain-food-and-wine-festival-2009 and I am happy to report they are still delivering an experience worthy of our dining dollars.   You could spend 10 dollars at a lunch that will simply fill the gap or you can step up and have a meal for $15 that you'll remember for a while."}
{"text":"I haven't actually had a sit-down meal at Charcut yet, just takeout. My dad went for lunch there, and brought me some lunch the other day. Wow, it knocked my socks off!   The lunch menu changes regularly, which is pretty cool. I had the brussel sprouts cooked in duck fat, poutine, and the tomahawk pork chop. Seriously one of the best lunches I've had in a long time. Everything was cooked perfectly, and though the brussel sprouts were a bit on the salty side, they were still really flavorful. I'm a huge poutine fan, and their poutine definitely hit the mark. Simple, yet rich and tasty. The tomahawk chop was delicious, and was HUGE! Definitely a nice filling lunch!  When my dad was there, he said Chef Connie came by and asked how everything was. Super awesome when chefs do that, shows they really do care about their work and their customers. I look forward to having a sit down meal there, which I plan to have happen sometime soon."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night for my anniversary.  Oh my goodness what can I say it was wonderful.  The choices were terrific, service was great and atmosphere felt amazing.  This is a bit pricey but for special occasions so worth it!  This great little gem is in Hotel Germain and they have valet!  Love Valet service...  Honestly though we will go back, I had there amazing steak with a salad that was terrific, cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth.  The Espresso Gelato was out of this world!  Give it a go!  We loved it :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Presentation, taste, quick delivery. The duck fat truffle poutine with gravy and TONS of cheese! Yes finally a restaurant that doesn't skimp on the cheese! Charcuterie board looked great. Bone marrow appetizer was different. Flank steak was carved and cooked perfectly rare - the way I love it. Just go!"}
{"text":"Delish and delightful! But super heavy on the protein.  Not many options when you don't feel like meat. The service was great and so was the atmosphere. Will come when I'm in carnivorous moods!"}
{"text":"I think this place has among the best steak in the city. Always good service, good food, and we always leave happy. The steaks are simply cooked to perfection, I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Great food with amazing story - be sure to ask your server about the place  Duck fat poutine is amazing. Burger is fantastic - lots of garlic though so don't schedule something after where you're doing a lot of talking  Eaten here a lot and never had a bad meal"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Charcut multiple times never totally impressed and I will not be returning in the near future. Despite a great theme the menu never seems all that appealing.  The burger was messy, difficult to eat and over salty.  A couple I dined with ordered the pork which had to be sent back for being way over cooked.  This then of course ruins the dining experience as they had to watch us eat while they waited for a replacement meal as they had run out of pork. The manager brought us a complimentary dessert platter that we didn't want, would have been better if he just covered my dinning companions meal.    Food not impressive, service meh, vibe so-so"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and probably one of the best burgers I've had in my life.  It was so greasy (from the cheese curds and the patty) and huge, I had to eat it with a knife and fork."}
{"text":"After being in Alberta and not being able to get a fine piece of steak not overcooked (I did have bad experiences in small towns up north), I was more than happy to be served the best steak I have ever tasted (and I normally don't order steaks in restaurants because I normally can cook a better one at home for a fraction of the cost.  This steak with chimichuri was succulent, the cheese topped fries and the wine recommention the waitress made for me were spot-on. In addition of that, I had such an amazing meal that I decided to end my trip with a hot coffee and cheesecake in a jar with pickled fruits (which tasted really fresh).  I will, of course, be back there if I return in Calgary."}
{"text":"Been here many of times and it is a fav for me to take out of town guests to show off what some of the local restaurants are serving up. I can say I haven't been disappointed with the food which is made with more care than most places. Where else can you go for charcuterie that is made in house and anything I've ordered off the dinner menu has been delicious.  If you are looking for a good dinner that would work with some wine or beer I would say this is one of the top places in town."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Charcut and I've had Alley Burgers from their food truck but never got around to eating here until a friend came to town and wanted to try it out. Three of us plowed through multiple appetizers, main courses and desserts. Everything was excellent including the service. I'm sure I'll be back soon to try out other menu items that sounded delicious.   Prices were on the high side but were justified. You're not going to get this quality food and service at many restaurants. I look forward to Charbar opening in the Simmons building later this year."}
{"text":"Finally, a true gourmet experience. This is my new favorite and it absolutely astounds me with the truly beautiful approach to the menu and patrons. Wonderful."}
{"text":"Attached to the Hotel Germaine.   The staff was very good, and the food was awesome.  I ordered the sausage burger and it was so flavorful.  The menu is a bit small but we still found things we liked.  The lemon tart is a must for dessert."}
{"text":"After watching Connie DeSousa, one of the Co-Executive chefs and Co-Owners of CHARCUT Roast House compete in \"Top Chef Canada\" I was determined to try some of her rustic culinary creations.   I must admit I had high expectations heading into the restaurant.  When we walked in we saw that it was a full house, having made reservations we were greeted at the door and seated right away.  The restaurant was well staffed and the timing of each dish that came out was perfect. Our waitress checked on us regularly and I never felt there was any impact on the service regardless of how busy it was.  The venue had a very modern and relaxed atmosphere that catered to a wide range of clientele.  We were seated next to a family with kids and across from us looked to be a girl's night out dinner.   There was good selection on the menu but I knew I had to experience some of the dishes that were prepared for the judges in the Top Chef competition.  I knew if it was good enough to impress the judges it's definitely going to impress me...and I was right about that one!  I would highly recommend trying the share burger, it's tender with lots of flavor, and the saltiness of the meat accentuated the fried egg and the bun perfectly. I rarely order burgers at restaurants but once you take your first bite you'll know what I'm raving about.   Summery  The food was delicious and the service was excellent.  I would recommend CHARCUT in a heartbeat; just make sure to make reservations so you are not left waiting.  The chefs embrace a passion for the food they serve and for their fans.  We ended the night with a picture and a signed menu from Connie herself.  This turned out to be a terrific dining experience.  I think this might have just made my top 10 favorites."}
{"text":"Forgive me Father but it has been ages since my last review... Charcut compelled me to write again!  If you look at my prior posts you will notice that I'm generally driven by 3 themes at the moment: lunch, pints and coffee.  I can say confidently that Charcut hits it very hard on one of these - lunch.  Head and shoulders, best in show, the Charcut 'all at once lunch' concept is a business lunch show stopper!!  The all at once lunch is in many ways a revved up 'blue plate special', a gastrolounge bento box... call it what you want but I think the best description is BEST LUNCH DEAL IN DOWNTOWN (sorry for the caps but they're totally deserved).  For the low low price of $15 you get sandwich of the day, soup of the day, fresh cut fries, and a cookie to go all in 40 min!  And this is food!  Great sandwiches, great soup and decent cookies.  I'm frankly torn on giving five stars... I mean the food is really good... I think it's the (I know this sounds lame) 'feel' of the place that holds me back.  On some levels it's really upscale and then on other levels it's a glorified sports bar.  Other than this strange incongruence I'm sold."}
{"text":"This is not a standard steakhouse so if you are looking for the usual rib eye and potatoes better try somewhere else. I found the menu a bit limited but enjoyed what I ordered. I had the butcher steak which was tasty and well prepared but at 7 ounces it was small for the price. My wife had the chicken which was moist and also well prepared. It needed the side orders (potatoes and summer squash) to make a filling meal. The artichoke salad and the tomato salad were pleasant if a bit salty. The restaurant is very noisy so it's not a place for a quiet conversation. The beer was good as was the wine but the prices were higher than we are used to in Ontario. Service was very good. Overall not a bad place but a bit on the expensive side for what you get."}
{"text":"What's cooler than dining at a restaurant that has a chef that competed on Chopped Canada? Meeting said chef from Chopped Canada!  A coworker suggested we head here for lunch one day, noting he has a friend who \"works here\" and I didn't think anything of it.  We got seated at a bench right in front of the open kitchen so we got to watch all the wonderful creations come together.   None other than Brody Ashton came to greet my coworker and I slightly fangirled as introduced himself lol  He recommended a few dishes to try, and I went with the ricotta gnocchi with wild mushrooms, and my two coworkers both got the butcher steak chimichurri. Seriously both dishes were amazing! The gnocchi was chock full of cheesy goodness and I had a bite of the steak which was cooked to perfection and the chimichurri really brought out the flavors of the meat.  Warm bag of cookies in hand, we got a photo op with Brody and went on our merry way.  Charcut caters to the hustle and bustle of the downtown diners, so they have a \"lunch all at once\" package where you get a soup or salad, sandwich or daily rotisserie, fries and cookies and you're guaranteed in and out in 45 mins.   Honestly, check out Charcut, you don't have an excuse not to!"}
{"text":"A friend who regularly visits Charcut brought me to show off the restaurant of a third place Top Chef Canada contender.  I first sat at the bar and perused the drink menu - I'm aware I'm going to pay upper scale prices for upper scale food, service, and ambience, but I don't like having to pay 8$ for a bottle of 2$ beer. They do have an impressive list of bottles to choose from, including some that are harder to find IPAs.  The table and menu looked good but it didn't really matter because of our terrible, terrible server.  I'll throw out some of his comments:  Him: \"I see you're on your phone so you must be not very interested in what I'm saying right now\" Us: \"wtf?\"  Him: \"I think we got off on the wrong foot\"  Us: \"huh?\" Him: \"I feel like there is nothing I can do to please you\" Us: \"wtf?\"  And then trying to rush us out with half a bottle of wine left: \"Should I bring out some coffees and the bill?\"  He seemed to get really offended when we made a joke about the beets that one a round on Top Chef when they came hidden under a pile of arugula - as if we had slapped his mom in the face. Super uncomfortable.   It was so weird- he was awkward and impolite to us the whole night. He then told us he \"was very ancy to leave so someone else would be taking over for him\", which we were elated to hear. We told our new server about the other dude's extreme strangeness/rudeness and he said he had an off personality and apologized. I would have liked to have seen maybe a comped dessert/coffee/app or really anything...because when you're looking at a 150$ bill and all you can talk about is how awful your service was for 90% of the night...it's not a great feeling.  My DC told me that had never happened to her on other visits to the restaurant, but I wouldn't recommend going back based on this experience.  PS: The steak and chicken were both quite good!"}
{"text":"Services was awful. Waitress was very rude, impatient with our questions, and rarely came to the table.   Food was almost inedible - two diners ordered the steak special, and there was so much lemon in the sauce it was absolutely overwhelming. Tasted more like ceviche than steak.   Internet was down, so they would only accept cash and credit card. There was no mention of this until the end of the meal when she didn't explain it but demanded a credit card.   Then she never came by to pick up the slip (with ALL our credit card info) and was so rude when I asked her to pick it up.   Will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"FINALLY crossed this one off my list today.  What I liked:  *I loved the menu-there is enough choice that unless you are a die hard vegan, you'd be happy. Not too much choice though that you'd have issues if you are indecisive like I am *I think the \"lunch all at once\" is a brilliant concept and reminds me of some of the clever concepts you'd find in downtown Toronto. Most of Calgary has not caught onto this kind of thing so it was nice to see *I ordered the Lunch all at once...it is a daily selection-today it was roasted mushroom and white bean soup, roasted turkey leg sandwich with mustard aioli rounded out with their signature parm fries. Delish. And the warm cookies are a delightful touch. *Service was quick, efficient and friendly  What missed the mark:  *It was packed and did get pretty noisy, especially being seated near the coffee station-when their cappuccino machine was on you couldn't hear your table mates *The tomato jam. I was intrigued based on previous reviews but to me would be better serve on something rather than as a dipping option.  I'll be back for sure-curious to see what else the menu has to offer."}
{"text":"I love fine dining and this place is overpriced  and over-hyped.  I would recommend Rush any day over Charcut.  The food wasn't bad but the value is not their for what you pay."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are great! I have been here four or five times and always enjoy the sandwich combo for $15.00. They have different daily features all the time but you can count on it being quality food. The warm cookies to go are an added bonus!"}
{"text":"I went to CHARCUT for lunch with my Hubs and a friend from out of town. We were there earlier than our booked reservation, but they took us in with no problem - and its a good thing because the place was packed soon after our arrival. The waiter informed us of the ham & cheese sandwich special as well as the rotisserie special of the day and left us to decide.   So many things sounded good, but I kept coming back to the ham & cheese sandwich.  Would I dare come to an acclaimed resaurant like CHARCUT and order a ham & cheese sandwich? Hell ya, I would! The lunch special comes with a small square of sandwich, a soup of the day, some parmesan fries and a bag of (2) chocolate chip cookies. It was the perfect lunch. The most underwhelming part of the plate was the soup - it was turkey barley.  I am not a fan of barley in soup and this one didn't really do anything to change my mind (but the Hubs happily finished it off for me). The parm fies were, though, heavenly.  Crispy with shavings of cheese over top and the right amount of salt.  It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that I was licking the parmesan filings off the plate long after the fries were finished. And then there was the ham & cheese sandwich.  Who would have thought something so simple would be so mouth-wateringly delicious? The foccacia bread is made in-house and was so soft and fresh.  The ham was from an actual ham roast and not picked up from the local deli counter and the sharp, aged cheese complimented it perfectly.  That was it, nothing else to muck it up. My friend got a warm chicken salad sandwich, my Hubs got sausage & peppers - they were both good, but nothing even came close to that simple ham & cheese sandwich. Except for the pork rillette! When my Hubs tweeted a picture of his sausage & peppers, the chef sent over a pork rillette for the table to enjoy.  What a great way to keep in touch with your customers! The little jar was filled of piggy goodness to smear on toasted brioche crostinis.  It was incredibly rich and unbelievably delicious. After sipping on an after-lunch latte until the rain subsided, we each got a bag of cookies to go and savoured those on the car ride back to Edmonton. It really was the perfect lunch."}
{"text":"Good, but needs more steak on the sheet to qualify as a steakhouse. Go elsewhere if you want a KC strip or Ribeye. Sides here are generous but on my visit they tasted too 'charred'.   Lastly Waazzzzup with a 5oz glass'o'wine for $14? Didn't think u could order that small for that much #ridonculous."}
{"text":"Been there only once to watch Top Chef Canada, had feature dish Connie made that night on the show... loved the ambiance, the food... we tried the apple and fennel salad and beef... really tasty... server was very friendly even though it was very busy.   Then we had the chance to meet Chef Connie, she's really friendly and loved that she went to every table to talk to her guests. Can't wait to go back there and try more of her food!"}
{"text":"Great service, very accomodating considering our large party was a total pain to deal with. We think you very much. I didn't really eat too much, but the food I had was good. The wine selection was good and some of the beers on the list were excellent. I especially likes the Kolsch, it was just like Kolsch in Germany, well done!  Overall a good spot."}
{"text":"An incredible dining experience! The staff was friendly and helpful with suggestions. A clean, modern atmosphere with a view to the open kitchen.  We started out with the bone marrow escargot. The bones were served cut in half with a parsley garlic topping. We ate the escargot on toasted brioche and foccacia. So rich and buttery with the bones marrow.  For our main course we shared the poutine with duck fat truffle gravy and cheese curds along with a burger with cheese curds and a fried egg. The poutine was so rich with enough gravy to cover the fries, but not so much that it was soggy. The burger was juicy with the fried egg and spicy from the arugula.  We enjoyed a decadent dinner and would go back in a heartbeat. I'd love to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"While the food was delicious (we had assorted appetizers including the shrimp and oysters) I wanted to write a review because of the amazing service we got! Our server, Julia C, was INCREDIBLE. She was exceptionally knowledgable, and told us (people who love food and have worked in food industries) tons of stuff we didn't know. Her explanation about different oyster types was simple and descriptive, and made me so excited to come back and try more! Even her beer knowledge was amazing! Most times I can rely on people to tell me whether something was more or less hoppy, but she worked hard (even bringing me a sample of an option to try) to make sure I found a beer I liked! I would become a regular just to have her as my server, thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"My family (and significant others) recently took my mom out for her birthday to Charcut.  Many of the group had been for lunch and raved about the quality of the meal (all for $25, and in under an hour) - which can be quite the accomplishment compared to many other downtown Calgary restaurants.  The customer service that we got making reso's via email and over the phone was absolutely incredible.  Since we had a large group (defined as parties of 7 or more at Charcut), we paid the required $25/person reservation fee.  The reservation fee is credited towards your bill, so we didn't mind paying that in advance.  The afternoon of the reservation, two of the party members fell ill.  Given that it was the day-of, I expected that if we tried to change our reservation, we'd loose our deposit.  I called to see what our options were, and was pleased with how accommodating they were.  They changed our reso to the following weekend without any issue, and without loosing our deposit.  So, even before we showed up for dinner, I was already pleased with the service.  Onto the food!  Absolutely incredible.  This place is all about letting the meat shine, so each of the main courses are JUST the meat.  To compliment your meal, you order shared sides.  Some of the table's favourites were the double bone-in pork chop, the prime rib and the slow roasted chicken. We also ordered a handful of \"table sides\" - our favourites here were the duck fat poutine, the grilled broccolini with chili flakes, and the roasted heirloom beets with homemade goat cheese.  All were top-notch.  I was glad that we were in a big group, because we got to try so many different things.  If there was one item that didn't really shine, it was the 6oz butcher steak.  It came pre-sliced, and covered with arugula.  It tasted decent, but it didn't really have the same impact as some of the other plates had.  This definitely isn't somewhere you would want to go if you are trying to be frugal, but we definitely enjoyed our meal for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Charcut was a disappointment, considering the great beef Alberta is known for.  Located downtown, attached to the trendy and upscale Le Germain Hotel, Charcut looks more like a developer's concept of a steakhouse, kind of like what you would see in a suburban mall.  Service was overly trained and had a corporate affect.  Addressing the table, \"Would we like drinks tonight?\" No, we would like to be spoken to  as if we are human beings, with hopes, regrets, jealousies, you get the picture.    The food sounded great on the menu, but everything tasted on the poor end of mediocre.  Prime Rib, ordered by the ounce, was not much better than what you would get in a chain restaurant. The sides were quite tasteless.  The pasta was not made in house, and was Olive Garden quality.  As I said, very disappointing.  The coup de gras were the prices.  Charcut is a damn expensive restaurant.  In fact, the bill was the highest of every restaurant we ate at in Calgary. This included a very overpriced $75.00 bottle of red wine,  the cheapest red on the wine list.  Charcut is a restaurant to avoid."}
{"text":"Overall the experience was a real disappointment. The food was pretty good, except that our mains took about 45 minutes to arrive (after the server had cleared our appetizers without asking before we were finished) and were cold when they did. It was also overpriced (I didn't mind paying $30 for the great charcutterie platter, but $7 for a few pieces of bread to go with it is a bit much. As is $12 for three onion rings... supposedly with deep-fried bone marrow, but we could't find it).  And the service was appallingly bad from beginning to end. Too bad, I had heard great things about this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, Amazing staff. Amazing ambiance. Great wine. Shrimp are a blessing here! I went here for my birthday dinner with my best friend and even got a free desert. 10/10 would go here again. Would be romantic for a date night!"}
{"text":"Delicious! This was a great high-end dining experience in downtown Calgary. The restaurant was a bit noisy and our booth a little cramped, but the food was so amazing, once you take your first bite you can't concentrate on anything else. Service was friendly and our server made excellent suggestions. We tried to sample everything, so ordered a meats, salad, pretzels and cheesecake for dessert. I welcome any opportunity to eat lamb, and Charcut does it right. The meat practically melts on your tongue it's so soft. Pretzels were delicious and tasted just like the ones I had in Munich, and the cheesecake-in-a-jar was perfect to end the meal -- just the right size for an already full stomach ;) Expect to pay a premium for these delights, though. Charcut is pricey, but I think it's justified. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Smaller than I expected, but really nice.  Seating wasn't the greatest I have seen.  Really informative and helpful service.  You'll want to order some items to share besides your main dish.  Good beer selection.  Maybe a better lunch place than dinner place.  Fairly expensive.  Pretty much everything tastes good  Butchers Steak 3.5/5 Duck Fat Poutine 4/5 Meat Platter 3.5/5 Cheesecake 5/5"}
{"text":"The poutine... OMG.  Our server's name was Yvanna and she was amazing.  Highly recommend coming here and having the poutine."}
{"text":"Had the Alberta Prime Rib and it was less than spectacular but not bad. Tasty beer and wine selection to choose from. If I came back it would not be for the prime rib, but instead for the ribeye which is slightly more pricey, but looks much better. Overall not a bad place. The ambiance and the service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Client de l'h√¥tel, lorsque je suis entr√© chez Charcut, j'ai trouv√© l'ambiance bruyante, tr√®s! La musique √©tait forte, et le brouhaha des conversations par dessus n'aidait pas. J'ai tout de suite pens√© que je payais l'ambiance et pas la qualit√© de la nourriture ou en tout cas, la quantit√©. Et bien j'avais tort, certes il faut aimer l'ambiance, mais le quart de cuisse de poulet r√¥tie (sauce citron) √©tait √©norme (je suis un gros mangeur) et je ne suis pas ressorti de l√† en ayant faim! 19CAD par personne, c'est tr√®s raisonnable pour ce standing. Le petit hic, c'est que les accompagnements sont en suppl√©ment, mais en France, ne r√™vez pas vous ne trouverez pas √ßa dans un restaurant d'h√¥tel 5 √©toiles!  From a French (of France) point of view, your chicken was just awesome, absolutely not dry! I'm looking forward to eat here when passing in Calgary in a, maybe, near future!"}
{"text":"Their lunch in 45 minutes special is what I get every time I go. It's hard to beat because it's always delicious, always $15 and always fast. The smaller sized sandwich comes with fries AND soup to help fill you up."}
{"text":"Had the Alleyburger, it was very tasty but a bit on the salty side.  Overall a very nice place that celebrate fatty tasty food done the right way, I would stop by again!"}
{"text":"I walked in at midnight on a Wednesday night and there was a decent crowd.  The place has some fancy items and ingredients -- many of which I do not know and I cannot pronounce.  I was told they were on Top Chef and that they had a unique menu.    The place is connected to a fancy St Germaine boutique hotel and was filled with people dressed very trendily.  I waited at the front for ten minutes without any help.  They even walked past me.  The staff is either busy or they sized me up and thought I wasn't worth the time.  I was wearing a blazer and tie, so this annoyed me.  Finally a purty waitress came and sat me at the bar.  I was ready to leave, but the Duck Fat Poutine seemed like something I could cross off my list for my two day whirlwind trip.  The bartneder was friendly after I started talking to the crowd, but was quiet for the first 5 minutes or so.  I was very turned off by this but the other bartender made up for it by being friendly.    They found out I came straight from 85 degree weather in Texas to 25 degree weather in Calgary, so they whipped me up a badass VALHRONA hot chocolate with what can only be described as a handcrafted marshmellow brick of awesomeness that barely fit in the cup.  It was a delightful magical cube of happy.  That hit the SPOT.  Hot diggity dang I wanted another 3 of those.  5/5  so damn good I still think about it.  The duck fat fried truffle poutine also had a nice twist to it.  I am not a huge fan of it but I figured I'd explore the great dishes of Canadia instead of chicken out and eat boring comfort food.  Very intense and strong -- not for everyone.  4/5   I wasn't hungry, so I couldn't try some of the more interesting entrees.  The bar crowd told me the head chef was on Top Chef and pays close attention to every detail.  I could see that.  If only the staff was friendly!  Most people would have walked out but I was walking ten blocks at 1am and just landed in Calgary so I just gave up and sat down."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Charcut & I was really impressed. We made last minute reservations for 2 so our original table was really small. My husband noticed they have an open kitchen w/a bar so we asked to sit there. No problem to move.   Charcut has wonderful lunch specials that have you in & out within 45 minutes (and they are a great deal). I had the lunch special w/sandwich of the day and my husband had the burger. Both were excellent though I liked the special b/c it came with sandwich, soup, fries & cookies for only $15. One of the best lunch deals in Calgary hands down.   Our server was very attentive and came back to check on us at least 3 times during our lunch (which is great considering it was very busy).  We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Some hits and misses, but the quality and overall basics are there. We went for a drop in supper and sat at the bar - bar service was adequate, but considering they didn't even start seating for 2 hours after we arrived we felt they could have given us a table and we didn't get much attention from the very busy bartender.  For appetizers we had the duck fat poutine and the roasted beet/goat cheese salad. The duck fat poutine was really comforting on the cold night, although the gravy could have had a deeper flavour and even the cheese choice was a little mild.  Great fries, not greasy, and just hit the spot.  The roasted beet and goat cheese salad was absolute heaven with a really great vinagrette.  We would go back just to order that for lunch. For main course we shared the $36 Charcut board.  You could see the care that was put into the ingredients, and I understand the price, but I was still a little underwhelmed.  We both agreed the absolute best thing on it was the rabbit terrine with apple butter - total foodgasm.  The other 4 items in the selection - pigs head mortadella, kielbasa, chorizo, and ham were tasty, but needed more accompaniment that we felt should be included for the price. We also would have liked more bread with our platter of meat - we should probably have ordered an additional side to balance out our meat meal.  Perhaps if we go back with reservations and now that we are experienced with their offerings we would have the full 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Attended this restaurant for lunch the first day of Stampede - July 6/12 - and had a great experience.  I had the corn dog, which was like no other corn dog I've ever tasted (and it was a foot long, I might add).  It was a delicious sausage with little chunks of cheese and green chili in it, encased in a tasty corn bread jacket.  The fries that accompanied it were sprinkled with parmesan, which really added a nice little touch.  I also ordered a watermelon, cucumber and feta salad and that was extremely good as well.  I had a gingerale with my lunch and all told it cost me $30, including tip.  Not inexpensive but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was tasty! I had the tomato penne, with a beet salad to start and finished with their \"warm cookies\" Great flavor on all the items, I'd love to go again but for dinner! The only thing that bugged me was their white wine list was majorly lacking in good choices."}
{"text":"Look. Don't argue with me. Just GO. I kid, I kid....  So. Read a lot of good things about Charcut. Walked over and pulled my favourite stunt on my shaved head, be-glassio'd, very attentive server. \"OK, if you were here for the VERY first time...what would YOU order?\" \"Do you like Burgers?\" \"Yeah, Brother\" Well, it was not like any Burger I've ever had; EVERYTHING was different with one hint of magic. I only know of 2 places in town who understand how French Fries really oughta' taste, and baby? I was BORN here, WAY too long ago... Hand cut, Peels ON.... more taste than you've ever had before. Chicken On The Way, in Kensington, and now Charcut. Delightful. The burger is a MIX of meats with sausage rolled in for a flavour kick. And CHEESY with top drawer cheese. They do Americano Coffee, not crap drip, was very well presented and service was prompt and efficient, not QUITE Christa at FARM,*see my review about her.... impossible to top, but great. I'm gonna' be seeing these guys again REAL soon."}
{"text":"Charcut is one of my personal favourites when it comes to a quick and cheap lunch. The service is great and the food generally tastes pretty good. I've been there a couple times and every time I'd order the lunch sandwich special which includes the daily featured sandwich, soup, parmesan fries and 2 cookies. The thing I fell in love with right away was their ketchup, which i believe is home made.  One thing I do find a little bit unsatisfying was the amount of grease on the toasts for the sandwich. But overall, my experiences there were great! Would recommend this place to anyone who asks me for a quick and good lunch place in the downtown area!   Also, the pig paperclips are a great touch (:"}
{"text":"If you like charcuterie, this is the place to go for a night out with a group of friends. The place is busy and a little noisy, and usually packed with corporate types and lawyers so if you want to have a romantic dinner, it might not be the right place. I took my wife there for her birthday, and it was a nice experience, even for light meat eaters like us. The service was nice and pleasant, the decor is contemporary and stylish, and we had no problem getting a quiet table away from the hustle and bustle. We originally wanted to share a charcuterie board and entree, but the server kindly advised us that it would be too much so we just shared the board with a side of duck fat poutine with truffle gravy (no disappointment here, what can go wrong with this combo) and a refreshing romaine lettuce salad. The board was well stocked with terrine, mortadella and other goodies, and a fantastic mustard. High quality ingredients, obviously hand made by people who understand fine charcuterie, and we even had enough leftovers packed for a couple of sandwiches the next day. However, it was really too much food for the two of us, and we regretted not having taken something lighter so we could try at least a hot entree and assess the kitchen skills. Also, if you like a well balanced meal, I would recommend ditching the poutine (not because it is not good) and replacing it with a side of greens. That will be for next time, the roasted pork belly is calling our name already. We finished off our meal with a very tasty chocolate parfait with sea salt caramel, ovaltine crunch, and dark chocolate crumb and a cup of very good capuccino. Price wise, it is not cheap, but not overly expensive. Count on spending under $100 for a couple, without wine."}
{"text":"I've only been for lunch a few times, but I love it!  I usually get the $15 lunch, which includes 1/2 a sandwich, soup, parmesan fries, and a cute little bag of cookies (so delicious!)  My favourite part though, is the little piggy paper clips you get on the cookies.  One time a server gave me a handful and I almost died. lol!"}
{"text":"Their sausage burger is truly incredible. And their deep fried marrow.  I don't give it 5 stars because there's an unknown element that makes you think they are not authentic enough. Maybe it is that the food, being so good and scrumption, does not match the executive feel it sports."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Calgary and I wanted to get a nice meal in before I headed to Banff in the morning. Wow, was I impressed! Every dish we got was top notch. Albeit being landlocked in Calgary, the albacore crudo was light and refreshing. The tuna jar and prime rib was also delectable. The star of the show was definitely the poutine-- being in the states, I didn't realize that I have never had real poutine before quite like this. It was simplistic perfection as the duck fat gravy marinaded the fries perfectly."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch and it was my first time at this restaurant. I had the \"Lunch all at once\" with the daily rotisserie for $25. It was very delicious and the serving size was perfect. The service was really good and as promised on the lunch-menu we were done in 45 min without rushing ourself.   Make sure to have a reservation as it is always busy."}
{"text":"To be completely honest I've been crushing a little bit on Executive chef Connie from Top Chef for a few years. I had the chance to randomly meet her at the Northern Lands food and wine festival and decided immediately I'm taking a road trip to her restaurant to check out the whole deal. I wasn't disappointed....  We drive down to the enemy city of Calgary with dead cow on my mind. We check in to the hotel and immediately B Line towards downtown for our supper.   The room is gorgeous! Wood on wood with an open kitchen concept which makes me happy to see them do their thing. I had the grilled octopus while my gal had a grilled bread with a melted heavy cheese. Both delicious. Honestly I coulda done with out the beans but awesome nonetheless.  My only issue at this point is the wine list. It's out of line with the food cost, and is waaaaay off vintage wise. I ordered a a wine on the list that was listed as 2011 and got a 2015. Massive problem for wine snobs, especially in a roast house but ok.  Entrees arrive and are near perfect. I had a NY strip with a salsa verde and roasted potatoes. Dynamic flavour on the steak with a perfect cook. Nothing but gold on the cow, the sauce was also delicious. But salsa verde with cilantro is really a chimichuri. Not a problem with me awesome! The gf had a beautiful fish special, with a simple polenta and greens. I thought it was a shade over but she loved it.   We shared a salted caramel cookie type pudding thing for dessert...freakishly delicious! High high recommendation on that bad boy.   All in all was so happy to check this place out. Loved it!! Go!   Cheers   Andy"}
{"text":"Visited with a group after a strategy session wanting a nice dinner out.  Great lamb & papardelle - one of the nicest thinnest al dent√© pasta papardelle I've tasted for a while.  Chef came out and chatted for a bit. She's lovely & also understands business. Chatted about her famous meatballs - One of the more seasoned professionals in my group is a huge fan so I got to listen in on hardcore chef talk!  Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place hit lunch out of the park! Probably one of the best lunches I have had in years. You get a soup and sandwich of the day, a heap of Parmesan fries and a bag of two delicious cookies -- all were amazing and we were completely full after the meal. The sandwich and soup of the day was also unique and fresh and tasted great. The value you get for 15$ is incredible!!  Unfortunately I don't live in Calgary or else I would be in here at least once a week for lunch...open one in Gainesville Fl please!"}
{"text":"Charcut is a gem in Calgary. Not only does it house our local celebrity Connie De Souza, but it is a TOP NOTCH restaurant to boot.  The first time I had gone there was during Dine Out Calgary. I was immediately impressed with the place when I walked in. The decor was stylish, upscale, and it was bustling inside - like I was in some kind of New York / Los Angeles restaurant! You dont get that very often in this city.. Upon being seated by a lovely French Canadian waitress, I ordered the tuna conserva, steak with chimichurri sauce and the saskatoon berry cheesecake. Tuna conserva was okay, I enjoyed it, but was not thrilled about it. My dining partners had the pig head mortadella, which they claimed were the best they had eaten. The steak was amazing. It was actually served in slices with the chimichurri sauce on it, and the fries on top of it too! Very unique presentation and very tasty dish. We were all very impressed with the dish. The dessert was also really good. I am not a huge fan of saskatoon berries, but it was still a very good dessert! Everyone at my table agreed and ate up the whole thing!  Now, lets move to... the drinks. This restaurant serves up some FANTASTIC cocktails. And I mean mouth-wateringly delicious. I cant quite remember the names, but there are some amazing cocktails served in champagne flutes, which you MUST try! One time I had this amazing concoction of apple/ pear, crushed ice and other forms of deliciousness which simply blew my mind.   Last, but definitely, NOT the least. Heck, the Alley Burgers. There are no words to describe it. It must be seen and attended to be fully understood. Charcut's high quality gourmet meat, on a warm bun... just $5. Yes, you read that right. This is not a typo. It is $5. But there is a catch. You will have to lineup in the alley behind the restaurant, possibly on a random weeknight and beat out a good hundred people to get your hands on these notoriously delicious and infamous burgers. But hey, nobody said life was going to be easy.   All in all, this restaurant has so many dimensions to it, its almost like a house of mirrors. A swanky, bustling house of glistening mirrors with terrific cocktails and Top Chef quality food."}
{"text":"Let's talk beer, they have Draft Wild Rose Cherry Porter, I would have moved away from Western Canada already if it weren't for Wild Roses Cherry Porter. Needless to say they got me off on the right foot.   Had the Half Chicken and Poutine. I thought to myself (having recently come back from Montreal) 'Why am I having the Poutine?'...I very quickly forgot about Montreal, this is the best Poutine I have ever had. I have deleted the words I tried to type about the poutine several times because they did not suffice. The Half Chicken was so moist and tender, the skin was delicate and crispy, and it came on a wood cutting board with a cool knife stabbed into the board. Simple things make me happy.  I had a great time at Charcut, and open late. See a show at the Epcor Centre and then go have something at Charcut or go to Charcut and then go to a show at the Epcor Centre, seems like a perfect evening to me."}
{"text":"Amazing.  I'm still raving about my pre-birthday dinner at Charcut.  We had the most beautiful piece of Alberta strip, charred to sweet perfection, with the full on horseradish and mash trimmings.  We also had the truffled duck fat poutine and the world, for a moment, just stopped there.  It's pure, fat and carb heaven.  They have a decent wine selection and even better prices.  Really great value for money. The Marriott's just right across the street but even at the Westin where we stayed, it would have been worth the walk on a frosty, January evening.    What a find in Calgary.  If you're in that town, you have to go."}
{"text":"Charcut gets a lot of hype, partially due to Connie DeSouzas long run on Top Chef Canada.   I'm here to tell you that even without that notoriety, Charcut would still be a much talked about Calgary hotspot.   Everything we tried, from the sausage and peppers, chicken salad, pork rillette, and the most amazing ham sandwich were fantastic.  All served with salty, delicious parmesan fries.   And the bag of warm cookies to go?? C'mon, who wouldn't love that?  The price is fairly reasonable too. The lunch special clocks in at $15.00 and included soup, sandwich, parmesan fries, and cookies. There is a $25.00 special too that is a bit different and includes the daily rotisserie."}
{"text":"Awesome poutine. It is nice to go to a restaurant and be encouraged to share your food. I got a cute pig paperclip at the end too."}
{"text":"I have been loving the restaurant scene in Calgary lately because there seems to be something brilliant for everyone. I was so impressed and anxious to try one the famed Alley Burgers back in the day when people would line up out back of the restaurant, cash in hand, for one of these very limited and exclusive burgers. At the time, it wasn't just about the burger, but more so the whole sense of excitement and exclusivity one felt to be the lucky person to get one.  Though the late night burger line is now a thing of the past, Charcut is still as cool as hell and has no intention of stopping. The burgers are still available, now more than ever, with the Alley Burger food truck. They are still as awesome as ever, but that is another story.  This story is about some of the great things coming out of the kitchen and minds of chefs and co-owners, Connie DeSouza and John Jackson. With a menu that changes daily, there's always something fresh and inspired. The interior is open and clean with some clever rustic touches throughout the space. I love the giant cow mural - quite fitting considering the theme of the restaurant.   Our server was knowledgeable about the items and very helpful when it came to recommending how to maximize our experience at Charcut. Thought the items are available as single servings, it is much better ordering everything family-style. The portions are larger and presented in a glorious spread on a thick wooden board. No nonsense. Just tuck in.  We had the pleasure of trying a Spragg's farm double thick pork chop, the butcher steak with chimichurri, the infamous duck fat poutine with black truffle gravy, a barley risotto and a simple, but very tasty roasted cauliflower gratin.  The meat was cooked to perfection. The pork, an item that is almost always cooked beyond recognition, was juicy and blushing. A nice medium rare on the butcher steak left us with a beautifully juicy and flavourful bite, with the herbaceous tones from the chimichurri to complement the bold and savoury flavours.   The poutine was something special. Duck fat makes a wonderfully balanced french fry with both crispness and a hint of duck flavour. The earthy perfume of the truffle comes through with an amazing gravy that envelopes the generous pile of fried goodness. Add to that the melted cheese and say goodnight.  Cauliflower is one of those vegetables that holds an incredible secret. Once roasted, it becomes something completely different than what you may have experienced before when you eat it simply boiled or steamed. The cauliflower gratin at Charcut is roasted to achieve a rich golden colour and almost nutty flavour. Within that, there is this aged cheddar that adds a slight sharpness and complexity, interspersed throughout. When you think that things are too sharp, the edge is softened with a soft egg yolk that, once broken, cascades down throughout the entire dish to bring unity. Simple perfection.  The barley risotto was very tasty and a nice departure from the traditional arborio rice variety. It was the perfect grain to hold onto the rustic nature of the entire meal. Both tender, but also with a little tooth, the barley is a fine complement to the already impressive array of dishes we experienced at Charcut.  I felt that our dining experience was well worth the price. The family-style presentation was not out of place in a fine dining atmosphere and I was comfortable and made to feel welcome by the great staff. I highly recommend this place to anyone that hasn't been. You will be impressed."}
{"text":"ambience was awesome. full charcuterie board was good for party of 6. fresh made pasta-both carbonara (which my friend had) and the conchiglie with garlic sausage were excellent. other entrees ordered were: feature steak, prime rib, and bison brisket-no complaints from my friends."}
{"text":"After having spent three weeks in Banff, Jasper and Glacier, I was really looking forward to a nice sit down meal.  I really wanted to eat some good poutine as well since it was my last night in Canada so I decided to try this place.  I would recommend making reservations if you want to eat there because they tend to fill up pretty quickly.  Their menu tends to change so I'm not sure if they'll still have what I ordered.  My group got one of their dishes for their cured meats: cured pork belly, sour cherries jelly, arugula or toasted bread.  I'm not a fan of cherries, let alone dried cherries but the accompaniment of the cherries and the pork belly and the arugula was divine.  It was absolutely delicious!  We all wanted the same dish so the waitress told us about ordering for the table with their family style on a giant meat board.  We ordered the prime rib, the slow roasted heritage chicken, a side of roasted heirloom tomatoes, duck fat poutine (topped with slow roasted pork) and jacket potatoes.  When it came out, it was literally a giant smorgasbord of meat with some vegetables thrown in.  The prime rib was melt in your mouth goodness accompanied by horse radish, giving it that perfect bite.  The chicken wasn't bad, flavorful and juicy.  The duck fat poutine topped with roasted pork was decadent.  It was incredibly rich, so much that we couldn't finish it!  the jacket potato was not bad, I probably wouldn't order it again.  The most loved dish of the night was actually the heirloom tomatoes.  They were hot balls of explode in your mouth tomato goodness.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and the food didn't take too long to come out either.  Overall: delicious hot tomatoes + decadent rich poutine + melt-in-your-mouth prime rib + delicious cured pork belly + friendly service = I either need to move to Canada to be closer to this restaurant or learn how to genuinely replicate their dishes!"}
{"text":"What can I say, It was an amazing meal. We have been there 2 other times before and have not been disappointed and this time was no different. The service is very intimate and the waiters/waitresses don't have so many tables that they cannot pay adequate attention to all their tables. They started off by offering us sample from their in house smoked meats which was amazing but we settled on house made pickles (cucumber, beet and jalape√±o) and pretzel with a cheese dip and another bread and cheese dip appetizer. Our dinner consisted of steak, fish and pork belly with sides of maple lime carrots and duck fat poutine. To cap it all off we ended the meal with cheesecake and chocolate mousse. It was a decant meal that cannot be repeated too often but when it is, it's memory last much longer than the meal itself.  Can't wait till my next birthday so we can go back ;)"}
{"text":"We went to Charcut for the first time Monday night, and it was absolutely amazing! It was just the two of us so we decided to share a Charcut Board, along with the Melted Cheese & Bread, and a Beet dish as well. I raved about this meal to so many people I figured I had better join Yelp to leave a review! I admit that our bill was fairly high, but that was entirely because we ordered an expensive bottle of wine  (worth it!) But the meal itself was very reasonably priced. The service was fantastic as well. I will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"High expectations left me a little disappointed. I mean it was good, but not noteworthy overall. Favourite part was the side of roasted tomatoes MMM. Chicken and prime rib were standard."}
{"text":"So so so damn good! Best prime rib I've ever had, the Brussels sprouts are to die for, the potato bacon thing, superb and the staff ROCKS! Vancouver shame on you! The service here is unreal our hometown should really take some notes. So worth the price, and there is valet outside so no need to worry about parking! For desert we ordered the caramel and chocolate salted pudding which was delicious and creamy.. So worth the lactose intolerance I will be experiencing on the ride back to our hotel.   Oh did I mention that there is a table full of actors including the guy from 90210, the HBO series OZ and the game of thrones!!!!"}
{"text":"We were just passing by & stopped as we were driving. We were seated immediately & very impressed by our waitress, she was very informative. Food was great & very filling. We will definitely return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've visited this restaurant. My favorite things were the pickles, melted cheese, and beet salad appetizers. The main dish chicken was delicious too. I loved the brussel sprouts above all else, and the bread pudding was yummy. The wait staff was a bit slow as they didn't keep my water full and I had to ask for refills twice. They also forgot to bring my friends sparkling water after she asked twice. It wasn't until the third time she asked (well into her dinner) they finally brought it out. Above all it was a nice experience, good food, and a nice atmosphere, but I may consider trying something else next time I visit Calgary."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I went to charcut for a date night... We both had steaks. Steak was cooked to perfection, but was slightly disappointed that dinner was not served on a board which it had done in the past. Everything aside the vibe of the restaurant was great."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. The lunch special, out in 45 min; well if you're rushed you'd be out in 25. It came quickly, everything was fresh and hot and above all delicious.   I've been here for dinner as well. The service is on point and the wine list is eclectic and thoughtful.   You have to come here regularly!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Calgary for the weekend and wanted to see what all of the hype was about Alberta beef.  We decided to try Char Cut for dinner based on the current reviews.  The place was packed and the service was a bit slow.  Three waitresses walked by and all were very friendly but it took almost 20 minutes for someone to actually take our drink orders.  Our waitress was super nice and attentive once she finally made it over to our table.  Wine selection was good and I tried one of their French red wines.  We ordered the escarole salad to start followed by the charred octopus and butcher's cut strip steak.   Salad was crisp, packed with fresh ingredients, and full of flavor.... so we were excited about the rest of our meal.  The charred octopus with sausage, tomatoes, and white beans was REALLY charred.  I suppose some people like their seafood this way, but ours was mostly burnt and dried out so we did not eat more than a bite each.  The steak was overcooked as well.  We ordered medium rare-to-rare and the meat came out as a pink medium.  I even specifically asked them to not overcook.  Too bad as we really wanted to have a nice beef from Alberta after being accustomed to eating great steak for years at many of the high end restaurants in Manhattan and Tokyo.  Overall, this was a disappointing foodie experience.   Perhaps this was just an off night for Char Cut."}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant in downtown Calgary. Located in the Hotel Le Germain Calgary. Decor is modern and simple. Beer selection is nice, and has a good wine list. The star of the show, however, is the Meat. I had the pork chop that was cooked perfectly, with cheese grits that were a bit different than the grits I am used to in the US. the grits were more whole, not coarse ground. My friend had the smoked prime rib, and to him it was the best prime rib he had ever had. We had to skip dessert, as we had the Chef's Choice Charcuterie Board, and the thing was massive as well as excellent. Overall a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. Was there this past Friday sept 22. This was the fourth time I have been there and is always great. We had a table of 5 with various dietary restrictions, lactose intolerance, vegetarian, low carb diet and they accommodated everyone. Polling the table all the dishes were exceptional. I had the fish of the day which was an Atlantic cod, was spectacular.  Also Connie DeSousa came out and visited the tables. Will definitely continue to come."}
{"text":"With all the 5* and 1* reviews I thought I would try this place out for myself.  This is a trendy restaurant, in a trendy hotel right downtown.  Trendy is not fancy it is not casual but fashionable.  I personally liked it and had no problems with the ambiance or atmosphere.  Service was good, the waiter attentive and apologetic when something went amiss.    Food was good, maybe a tad on the expensive side, but not unexpected at such a venue.  I tried to order all the things people commented about:  Slow Roasted Heirloom Beets - it was good, but nothing I couldn't do myself.   Bone Marrow au Gratin - very nice, would definitely recommend. Charcut platter - good, but a bit pricey for what you get. Butcher steak - well flavoured and cooked, would definitely recommend. Slow Roasted Heritage Chicken - the big surprise of the night, my date wasn't that adventurous and thought it would be simple.  On the contrary, a very dreary roast chicken was brought to life by this wonderful chef.  A reviewer comparing this to Swiss Chalet should be neutered. Duck Fat Poutine - i liked it, and made for a good side.  I have a few beers, their beer list is very good, and a desert that fell flat.  All in all, a good place that I can happily endorse."}
{"text":"OK, so this is my 2nd trip to Calgary in less than a year.  Didn't expect that I would be excited to come back here considering some of the places I've been in the last 2 years with work....but anyone that knows me is well aware that I'm a huge Charcut fan and one of the main reasons I was psyched to come back.  Calgary.  Mountains, rivers, nice people, wildlife......Charcut Share Burger!  All I can say is this place has great service, unique menu choices, and a great atmosphere.  They have a mixologist on staff that competes in the mixed drink competition every year and places near the top every time.    They like to try and pair their foods with beer as much as wine which I love.  I suggest sitting at the bar and asking for beer/wine pairing suggestions with everything you eat.  My usual is the Charcut Burger, Poutine, and a beer.  Or you can try the Roast Chicken and a Hacker Pschorr (sp?) beer....either way you won't be disappointed.    If you find yourself in Calgary for any reason go to the Hotel le Germain and on the ground floor you will find Charcut....enjoy!"}
{"text":"Loved the potatoes with bacon and sour cream, the steak was also very flavorful. One of the best I've tried. The octopus was very interesting, I liked the sauce with the sourdough bread that came with it. The oysters had a very peculiar taste, it was the first time my boyfriend tried it. He also tried rabbit for the first time, I don't think he'll try it again. The butterscotch dessert was delicious and the cheesecake was good! The customer service was also good and the ambience was nice."}
{"text":"Had a great business dinner here with a large group.  Fun atmosphere (felt like a German brew house mixed with a Brazilian steakhouse.   Great service and a delicious assortment of meats and sides.  A lot of fun."}
{"text":"Another stellar dinner at Charcut! Staying at  luxury-chic Germain hotel makes lunch and dinner at Charcut the best. Servicevis always highly personable and the menu varies often. Tonight's dinner with Caesar yogurt and arugula steak as melt in mouth perfection, thanks Charcut. By the way, the cookie paper bag at lunch is a true treat, for those decadent days....."}
{"text":"The food is incredible. Especially the pickled and roasted beet salad with house made goat cheese. The steak and duck fat poitine was just amazing. Our server was knowledgable, friendly, and patient with is as it took us a while to decide on our entrees. Everything looked so good !   Will return soon and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Can I give 6 stars? This was the single best dining experience we have had in Calgary since we moved here. I am still thinking about the experience, the people we met there (staff) and the FOOD, wow!  Hubby had a brilliant last minute idea of a date night this past Wed morning. We had been wanting to go to Charcut for awhile and he was able to get a table by booking on line for the same day which was surprising!   We met downtown and inside we went! I love when there is a hostess actually standing AT the hostess stand and the amazing service started here! The hostess took my hubby's jacket and we were seated at table 63 where I was metres from the open style kitchen. My husband, knowing I am a huge foodie, Food Network fan AND Top Chef fan said, \"Yep, there she is!\" I looked up and there was Connie with a smile on her face waving to us! I managed to keep my composure, yes, I was a little star struck and sat myself down properly in our little booth and did not hit the floor as my heart did stop for a mili-second! We had about 5 waiters come to our table throughout the night and I just loved feeling like we were appreciated customers!  The night started off with a choice of natural or sparkling water - nice touch, and I did not see the sparkling water added at all to our bill. This is not a place we found that nickels and dimes the customer. The restaurant works together in all areas to make sure you have a wicked overall experience!   Connie HERSELF brought us a stunning plate of thinly sliced cured meats and fish crocettes to start. HOW NICE! She must have talked to us for 15 min, wondering what our story was and telling us how she was doing as I had 40 questions! None of the Top Chef fame has gone to her head whatsoever. She is personable, down to earth and really added to our dining experience! That gift plate from the kitchen was very special. Next up, we ordered the heirloom beet plate. I am so glad they had this for me to try as the menu changes DAILY and you just never know what they will add/take off the menu. The beets and greens were to die for and everything was seasoned beautifully and the greens were not overdressed. YUM!   Moving on, we had the infamous duck fat poutine as we just HAD TO and I am so glad we did. The portion size was large! Just perfect for 2 people, a poutine unlike I have ever had before. Perfection from the still-crispy fries, to the LARGE pieces of curds to that gravy that made the dish.   Then we ordered the steak which was served on a cool cutting board complete with the large steak knife sticking out of it. On the board also was my pasta dish that was covered in sumptuous baby clams and BACON! We were somehow able to eat almost everything with the promise to myself that the next day I would not eat ANYTHING to make up for it, haha! The steak was seasoned perfectly. I can see how some may say that the meats are salty here but I love, love, love how they prepped everything. I know if I come back here, the food will be consistent and just as great.   The restaurant is a roasthouse whose mission statement is just evolving simple ingredients. I love this point of view. The restaurant also focuses on family style eating so being a whole bunch of people with you, you will be well taken care of and you will leave full!   Our water glasses were always kept full and I was impressed with the wine list. I had 2 glasses of an incredible Malbec that made my meal sing even more! Speaking of lists, I appreciated the fact that the menu was not a 100 page book. One simple sheet, front and back is all that is needed. You know then that the ingredients will be fresh and the chefs get very good at the dishes that they do prep.  Not dessert people normally but we had to round the meal out with something sweet, right? We had a choice of 3 things - we opted for the blueberry cheesecake which came in a little mason jar. So original and so deelish! Connie brought this out to us herself and also on the dessert plate laid 2 still-warm chocolate chip cookies like grandma would make! :) Congratulations was written in chocolate on our white plate as she had heard that we were recently married. :) Sweet! Connie works very hard, only taking Sunday off. She is even present for lunches and there is a very cool place for people to sit and watch the chefs in action at the kitchen bar. I will be going to lunch here as I am dying to try some other menu items and the soup that they serve mid-day.  The restaurant is hip, urban but not at all pretentious. Everyone makes you feel at home, including Connie's husband Jean-Francois who seems like such a nice guy! I was lucky enough to be able to chat with him too!  Everything here just seems to run so smoothly and the staff nails the little things for the meal which I feel is so important.  I could go on and on but I won't - other than to say that we found the prices so reasonable for what we got that we will be back here on a monthly basis.  5 huge, shiny stars."}
{"text":"Party of two on a Saturday night. Quite noisy but restaurant decor is sleek and cool. Open kitchen makes it possible to watch chefs in action. Service was fair but we received less attentive service than others as the night got busier. We initially planned to have three dishes but our server advised that two dishes would suffice for two. This honest advice I greatly appreciated because we were indeed full on two dishes. Ordered bison brisket and sausage burger to share. I would give the bison a 2/5 as the meat was tough and definitely not worth the price. It came with a red sauce, boar bacon, sour cream, mushrooms and I believe parsnip pur√©e. Sauce and pur√©e were definitely needed to redeem tough and dry meat. Bacon was thin and perfectly crisp, adding the necessary salt to the dish and, together with sour cream and sauce, complemented the mild tasting pur√©e very well. The burger was a pleasant surprise. The burger is sold by the ounce, which is perfect for those who want to try the burger without fearing of ordering too much. You control how big of a burger you want. A perfectly runny sunny up egg and melted cheese curds added great flavour to the deliciously moist and well seasoned patty. Arugula helps cut the richness. It is however, messy to eat, and I don't understand why the menu calls it a \"share burger\" because you are getting a single burger, not multiple. Nor is it easy to split because the egg yolk cannot be easily split into multiple portions along with th rest of the burger. This first review I would give 2.5 to 3 stars for fair service and disappointingly tough meat for a meat centric restaurant charging fairly high prices. I will have to try other meat dishes next visit and see if my review of the place improves. Overall, restaurant is fair."}
{"text":"The service was a little bit slower than I would have liked but what was lacking in speed was made up in friendliness and personality of our server !  The food was amazing, we ordered the charcut half board with bread and a bottle of wine to start, then moved onto the steak with two sides to share. The potatoes were amazing and who knew Brussels sprouts could be so good !   Will definitely return and will highly recommend to friends and family !"}
{"text":"Burger was very good. Got the food as family style so the four of us could share. We got all the beef dishes on the menu and they were all prepared well. Cheesecake dessert was good. Only thing we didnt like was the charcuterie board - the long stick of meat was way too salty and the rest of the meats was nothing special."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal was about the \"duck fat\" poutine.  it was nothing special. Food was ok, atmoshere was amazing. We had the full flight of food, from wine, chat cut board, mains and desserts.  the home made cold cuts were great, huge amount we had to take home. I had the Bone Marrow and Escargot au Gratin appie.. ehh.  wouldnt order again. my partner had the smoked prime rib.  Was again.. just ok. I had the Spring Creek Butcher Steak.  it was bad.  Very tough.  desert was very good, the raspberry cheesecake was very good, and Milk Chocolate Parfait was also very good.  All in all I may come back here, but it wouldnt be my top choice. Would be a good place to come right after work for a drink and appies. Oh and service was top notch.  not one complaint there."}
{"text":"As a carnivore, Charcut is easily one of my favorite restaurants! Their smoked and roasted meats will seriously never leave you dissatisfied! Today my husband and I tried their raved-about lunch special- delightful soup, DELICIOUS BBQ BEEF with aged cheddar sandwich, Parmesan fries AND A BAG OF COOKIES all for $16!!! Remarkable and perfect to split- leaves you pleasantly full. They're the kind of place that doesn't serve you ketchup but tomato jam. They're dishes are unique but approachable, and you'll want everything on the menu!  Also- if you're committing to a nice dinner out or have something to celebrate, you cannot leave without ordering their Brisket entree. It's one of their priciest items, but I  dream about it and it's one of my first stops whenever I come into town again.   We've also had the sausage burger which is amazing, but not for the faint of heart or stomach (definitely split-able; it's massive). We also like the octopus small plate with gigante beans- a bit of spice and so rich! The poutine with truffle oil is also a great indulgence if you're looking to go all out. And the icing on top is that they always have a great selection of local and imported drafts.  Seriously, just go. :)"}
{"text":"Based on amazing Yelp reviews, a coworker and I made a reservation at Charcut for dinner the night we arrived in Calgary.  Since the restaurant recommends sharing all food family style, we decided to go for it and ordered the beet salad, pig head mortadella with mustard, prime rib with rosemary, brussel sprouts, poutine and salted caramel chocolate pudding.  All of the food was flavorful and absolutely beautifully presented.  We also tried the hand crafted sodas and really enjoyed the fresh taste.  The restaurant was packed on a Tuesday night, the atmosphere was lively and the service was energetic and so enjoyable.  Definitely a great place to dine in downtown Calgary!"}
{"text":"Charcut should be an example to other restaurants when it comes to what customer service is all about.  We had an early date night dinner there tonight as we haven't been out in a few months. We initially went in with lower expectations since we almost always leave disappointed and underwhelmed. But tonight was different, we had walked into a restaurant where we were treated like human beings and not just another ticket.  Our server Raven did an exceptional job, she was friendly, attentive and informative. Our water glasses were filled and never left empty, she gave us the rundown on the restaurant and fun facts about the walls and lighting fixtures. That was really sweet of her to do.  The decor was beautiful, it had a dark modern feel to it.  As for the food.   1. The steak with salsa verde we wished the portion was a little bigger and a better seare on it. It was tender, the salsa on it was delicious.   2. The papperdelle pasta dish, sooo good and decadent. I wouldn't change a thing about it.  3. Artichoke dip was delicious and perfect portion for a appetizer.  4. Cesare salad, it was good we didn't love it or hate it. It was okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again.  5. Salted caramel chocolate dessert in a Mason jar...(forgot the name of it) was soo good we had 1 each and my partner tested my love for him tonight by asking for the last spoonful lol. Needless to say, I gave it to him but only because I was stuffed lol..  Next on our list is Charbar, Charcut's sister resturant to see if it is just as good.    I think it would all come down to the service. We now have a place to come for our celebrations and can't wait to come back. Hope to have the same server Raven, she honestly made the experience worth while for us.  P.s we didnt get a chance to take many pics, my partner kept digging in before I could snap a few good ones."}
{"text":"For months and months I have been hearing about the ALLEYBURGER at Charcut.  Tweets, pics and videos have been posted as many of participated in this back alley ritual.   You Tube videos and mentions on mainstream news shows have given much exposure to this genious idea...   -post a tweet to let the public know that tonite it's \"on\",  -wait for people to show,  -then at the specified time open the back door to a restaurant that was named \"Best New Restaurants of 2010 list for Where Canada\", and sell their infamous burger in a bag for $5.  I have been waiting for an opportunity to participate in this experience.  The day finally arrived.  Saw the tweet on Wed which announced that Alleyburgers would be available Thursday nite at 10:30pm.  Nothing in my calendar for Thurs nite...  yeah.  Arrived at the back alley of Charcut at approx 9:20pm on Thursday nite.  With still over an hour before serving time, the line was already quite long, or at least it seemed so.  People continued to arrive...  the line formed and L-shape, and was well over 100 people before 10pm.  How many burgers would be available for sale? How many people would be turned away?  Would I actually get a burger?  The staff of Charcut started their walk thru the line - selling tickets for $5 each.  Get a ticket = Get a burger.  HUGE sigh of relief as Connie took my $5 and give me a pick ticket.  Few minutes later, not far behind where Wendy & I were standing, we heard the groans as the last tickets were sold.  So many people turned away.   The line started to move.  Once the back door opened everything happened quickly - it was obvious that the staff has done this many times. Tray with bags held by one person, another person took my pink ticket and gave me THE brown bag.  You have no idea how much I wanted to bite into that burger - but first - needed a pic.  Reg took my camera and said he would take a pic of me - usually don't allow this, but tonite was an exception.  Realized after he took a picture of me taking a huge bite, that I didn't snap a photo of the BURGER itself.  Next time.  I took a bite.  And it was as delish as every person has ever said.  The bun was fresh.  Not extra items on it (i like my burgers plain)...  just this amazing burger, cooked to perfection.  Brad, a friend of a friend, a person that I have met once before, was one of the people that arrived to late to but a coveted pink ticket.  This was to good of a burger to not share.  Brad agreed - it was good.  Whole experience was over so fast.  It's hours later, I have since had something else to eat...  however the taste of that burger lingers.  I can hardly wait to do it again...  soon."}
{"text":"Vegetarians, just walk on by, this place is all about the meat.   The decor of Charcut is cosmopolitan and chic, very similar in look and feel to the Glowbal chain of restaurants in Vancouver. I always enjoy an open kitchen, particularly when there is an adjacent ageing room loaded with meat and sausages to view.  This restaurant could get 5 stars alone for the Charcut Board of house-made sausage & cured meat. It contained a sampling of pig head mortadella and brassica mustard, chicken liver mousse, pork croquettes, a smoked trout mousse, and a rabbit terrine. The 5 of us attacked it like a pack of ravenous jackals leaving only crumbs after but a few minutes. All were very strong offerings but the croquettes and the trout mousse were the standouts.   The main I ordered was the whole rainbow trout with charred broxburn tomatoes and and okanagan leeks. It was flavorful and moist, cooked to perfection, and it left me wanting more. My dining companions ordered the roasted chicken and the pork belly with polenta. The consensus was that the pork belly was the only weak link in the main courses, with it being a little soft and exceptionally fatty. The fried green beans with toasted hazelnut and the complimentary duck fat fried poutine with truffle gravy (which our server surprised us with) were both strong dishes and enjoyed by all.   We couldn't resist ordering a round of Valrhona chocolate semi freddo with the Frangelico anglaise and hazlenut brittle. The combination was transcendent and is now on my list of all-time favourite desserts.   During coffee, chef Connie DeSousa came by to say hello. She humbly accepted our praise and was incredibly gracious. I have to say I was disappointed when she turned down my offer to become my personal chef, but a girl has to ask ."}
{"text":"For all the meat lovers! Charcut offers a lot of juicy and savoury meat dishes and a party like atmosphere. Make sure you arrive hungry!"}
{"text":"After watching Connie DeSousa on Top Chef Canada, it was clear for us that on our next visit to Calgary, the one item on the must-do list was dinner at Charcut. Both my wife and I are meat aficionados, but very picky ones at that. So, Connie's vast knowledge of and dedication to her meats really made an impression. I therefore expected one of the best carnivorous feasts in a while when I made a reservation for us and two friends at Charcut. Unfortunately, the actual experience was quite the opposite.  Let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat: There is one reason that I'm awarding three stars instead of two and that is the restaurant itself (as opposed to the food). Not only is Charcut a beautiful place that manages to perfectly walk the line between modern and 'comfy'; first and foremost, their staff is fantastic with great service from the start. The hosts were extremely friendly and welcoming and our waitress was very engaging, knowledgeable and helpful. I have only good things to say about this side of the dining experience. Unfortunately, the food didn't match.  Ironically, the only dishes that were between good and great that night were non-meat dishes. For an appetizer, we all shared the heirloom beets with goat cheese and some warm focaccia bread and the now famous pork croquettes. The beets were stellar, the bread was pleasant but nothing to write home about and the croquettes ... oh, the croquettes. This is where everything started to go wrong. Since Connie made them on TCC, I had been looking forward to trying them. But what a letdown it was. The accompanying onion rings were a hit with my fellow diners (I'm not a big fan in general), but the meat was not only overly salty (a continuing trend of the night), but also terribly dry. The flavour, as far as it could be discerned through all the salt, was not unpleasant, but also not spectacular by any standard. Between the four of us, we almost didn't eat the last one of the five small-ish croquettes, which only ended up getting devoured because we didn't want it to go to waste.   The main course was even worse. One of my friends ordered the grilled trout and was very happy with it. Again, this was the only non-meat dish in that course and the only one that was not extremely underwhelming. Because I wanted to give Connie's pork one more shot (after all, that's what I had been looking forward to the most), I ordered the smallest incarnation (9oz) of the sausage burger. As a reflex (I usually do this for beef burgers), I accidentally asked our waitress if I could order it medium, which she obviously said I could not, seeing as it was pork sausage. However, she also said that even cooked through, this was one juicy burger. Luckily for her, she wasn't under oath at the time, because what I got was, while being the least salty meat dish of the night and quite nice in flavour overall, also the driest. Not only was the sausage patty helplessly overcooked, but so was the egg on top, which was just barely runny. Both my wife and our other friend ordered the bison steak and while at least this piece of meat was perfectly cooked to order, the entire plate was drenched in a chimichurri sauce that was not only so spicy that it effectively canceled out the flavour of the bison, but also took the prize for the most over-salted element of the whole dinner. We also ordered two table sides and both were mediocre. The broccolini had not been treated very well prior to cooking and had lost a lot of their vibrant colour and the truffled duck fat fried poutine is a dish I've had better at several other restaurants.  But what really sealed the deal for me (negatively speaking) was the dessert. We ordered the creme brulee and the smores bar to share. The creme brulee was nice, but again nothing to write home about. The smores bar, on the other hand, was the only thing that I, usually being a notoriously uncomplicated customer to a fault, actually considered sending back. While the cookie and chocolate portion of the dish was utterly unspectacular but not offensive, the latter could not be said about the marshmallow. It was so tough, overly sweet and otherwise flavourless that it reminded me only of the stale, stringy stuff you get a country fairs. I can only hope that Charcut does not actually employ a pastry chef, because if this dish was made by one, they should be fired on the spot.   Overall, it was one of the most disappointing dining experiences in recent memory and the fact that we may have gone on with too heightened expectations does not nearly account for all of that disappointment. If I was a praying man, I would pray that this was only an off-night - and many other reviews here suggest that it may have been - because I was such a fan of Connie's on Top Chef. However, at $75 per person (with tip), I'll be somewhat hesitant to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"The food was quite tasty but some of the dishes were pricey. We got the labneh which is essentially a yogurt dip but it didn't come with bread or anything to dip it with?? Instead we had to order bread separately which was essentially four tiny slices for $8! Very expensive for what you're getting. The steaks were very good. I got the prime rib and my husband got the market steak. The prime rib was cooked nicely but it was a little thin. My husband really enjoyed his steak. The caramel and chocolate pudding was delightful."}
{"text":"Charcut how dare you maintain your level of awesomeness?  Kudos on being a part of Matty Matheson's Vice video. It encouraged me to schedule drinks and appys on a friday night as means of showing off my high-brow taste for Calgary fine-cuisine.  But let's face it, I'm just a hermit who prefers to cook at home. But that's ok because when your dinner companions love food and talk about it as much as you do, then venturing out and stretching visa card isn't as difficult of a decision to make.  We each had the rum old fashioned. It was topped with one of those cherries soaked in moonshine that one bite makes your whole mouth numb. As for old fashioned-y goodness, this one is right up on par. But for some weird reason when I lifted my glass, the bottom came apart and we were left with a messy mystery. While I was too busy trying to figure out the science behind this, Charcut immediately replaced my drink with a fresh batch of anaesthetic cherries.  Ouuu and their mint juleps. Made with woodford reserv on a copper glass chilled to sub zero temperatures. It was refreshing beyond any description I could come up with.  Finally the appies. Pigs head mortadella, boar bacon salad with poached egg, and truffle poutine. So much food that soaked up the ominous cloud of drUNK that hung above our heads."}
{"text":"They were very busy and understaffed for a Thursday night.  Management handled very professionally the issues.  The beet salad was the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"Dinner and presentation was well done and I would go back to Charcut because of the food alone.  The Bad part! Service was horrendous.. this is not a five dollar diner. I expect better.  I had dinner with a good friend that I had not seen in awhile so we took more time than usual for dinner. This should be fine since the place was not overly busy and open passed 12 am. The waiter, oh my god, the waiter!!! was cold, short, and arrogant. Which would be fine if she had the knowledge and expertise to back up that arrogance. Frosty service!   The table adjacent to us had a different waiter. This variance was astonishing. If he was our waiter I would given Charcut higher rating but because of the negative effect of the service, I cannot, in good conscious praise the dining experience."}
{"text":"This was a special trip out to Calgary/Banff for my mum's birthday.  She rarely eats good steak, and so I wanted to take her somewhere nice!  We decided to get two main entrees as well as their duck fat poutine.  This specific poutine was something that I personally was looking for on this trip:  prime rib with onion rings and bone marrow bison brisket served with mashed potatoes duck fat poutine  Prime Rib with onion rings and bone marrow:  by far the best prime rib that I've had.  The marrow was exceedingly great as well, almost as good as having seared foie gras. PROS -perfectly cooked to order (we had it at a nice medium) -super tender, juicy : my mom's face was priceless -definitely shareable for two eaters  CONS -too much batter on the bone marrow.  It was tasty, but after the first three bites, we ended up picking off the batter -too much fried things in general when you add in the onion rings.  Bison Brisket with Mashed Potatoes PROS -ridiculously tender -not overly seasoned so you can get the full flavor of the meat -mashed potatoes was so creamy! -those bacon bits were amazing: super crispy, almost no fat and shaved super thin.  I want to say that they were prosciutto instead of bacon!  CONS -none.  Almost too filling if you get the poutine!  Duck fat Poutine: I am comparing this to the duck fat fries from Annabel Lees tavern in Baltimore, MD.  THAT was some seriously good duck fat fries there. PROS -huge amount: definitely shareable for the table -great gravy: I love gravy so this was just amazing  CONS -not enough duck fat flavor -worse: not enough cheese curds!  I only saw ONE cheese curd on the top of my poutine.  I know that the majority of the curds had melted, but seriously, I wanted nice chunks of cheese curds to chew on during my meal!  All in all though, I had a fantastic meal, and my mum was so happy and so wow'd by the food.  Best of all was the service.  It seemed like a fancy place but as we were on holiday with our main purpose of hiking in Banff, we only had jeans and sneakers to eat in.  However, the staff still treated us like kings.  Thank you for that :) it made my annual mum's birthday meal extra awesome.  Definitely would love to come again the next time I visit Calgary."}
{"text":"Expensive but good food, Beet salad with cream goat cheese, charcuterie for 2 (just meat, no bread or crackers) $40  Enough for after theatre snack but not for dinner, wine started at $ 40 - 140, only 8 reds and 8 whites to choose from. More of a martini crowd"}
{"text":"This place use to be a five star for me. Lately, I've been getting a few less than five star experiences. Having said that, on Stephen Ave, it is one of the better choices. The ambience will impress your out of town guests, the food isn't your typical west coast cuisine that you find at chain restaurants.   My picks: dessert, poutine, charcuterie, soup, and lunch specials. The environment is lively and loud. If you are an out of towner, definitely give it a go. Make reservations as it is one of the most popular spots."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and I have no complaints. The first time we came we had a waiter named Zack. He was very knowledgeable about the menu. He was great at filling up our cups with water and making sure we enjoyed the food and if we needed anything. Most recently, we had a waiter named Tim. He was pretty soft spoken, but he was also knowledgeable and provided his recommendations to help us decide what to order. Our food was so delicious. My boyfriend got the bison and I got the buffalo mozzarella, sun-dried tomato, radicchio salad... honestly, DELICIOUS!! I was craving it after and hoping to make it at home (but don't really know the rest of the ingredients other than what's stated) They had a great tea pot too."}
{"text":"One word, delicious! Salad, nice and fresh, perfect amount of dressing, not overpowering, fine grated cheese. Meat cooked to perfection. Beautiful presentation. Service of prompt. Decent wine selection. Nicely portioned."}
{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous Food - Average Service.   After we were finally seated 25 minutes after our reservation, our server, Zack, was mildly attentive and not relatable. I would expect a higher level of service from a restaurant of this caliber.  This was my first time dining at Charcut, yet we have stayed at Le Germain numerous times.   Guests at my table started off by trying the melted cheese and bread to start. Their reviews were not overly joyous however the rest of the meal blew us away. I ordered the bison brisket which was probably the best dish I have had in years! The truffle poutine was a yummy gourmet spin on the traditional Montreal dish. As a side it was too much to add onto a entr√©e as one poutine for the table would have sufficed. Another guest at the table had the beet salad which she throughly enjoyed. To finish off dinner we had the French Toast Pie which I would highly recommend!   I would go back to give them another try as the dinner was unbelievable, but not without an email to the manager to make them aware of our level of service received and how it dampened our experience."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Butcher steak was too seasoned whereas the prime rib wasn't seasoned enough. The pork belly was just plain salty and the grits lacked flavor. The onion rings and most of the meal was incredibly greasy. The plus side, the sticky toffee pudding wasn't bad and the Pinot noir was good. The service however was quite good."}
{"text":"This was my favourite meal throughout my whole trip to Calgary, Banff, Lake Louise, and Jasper.  Came here with my family at around 8pm on a weekday night and it was moderately busy.  A nice formal ambiance was set with the candle lit dining room.  Our waiter provided tremendous help in navigating through the menu and ordering an appropriate amount of food for my family (5 ppl) - you generally just order a bunch of dishes and share.  After careful consideration and input from our waiter, we decided to order the escarole salad, arugula salad, Charcut board, 14oz of prime rib, and poutine.  All of these dishes were fantastic, but my favourites were the prime rib and escarole salad.  The prime rib definitely lived up to the hype - it's very tender and served pre-sliced.  Also, the escarole salad was like the Ferrari of caesar salads.  This amount of food was just right, if not a bit too much for my family of 5.  Charcut was among the most unique and tasty restaurants I've been to.  If you're ever in Calgary, this is a must-go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice and welcoming personnel. Nice and classy decor. We had the escarole salad and the charcuterie plate. Both were very good with high quality ingredients. The charcut board can be shared for 4 as appetizer or for two as main dish. The amount of meat on it is huge! I wished they served it with more bread and crackers. We had to buy bread. This is why I give 4 stars and not 5. I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great cocktails.  Decent wines although their wine list needs updating.  I love the family style serving option.  Had the prime rib, the chef's beef selection and the chicken.  Awesome!!  If you're a carnivore, this is the place to go in Calgary."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant, and it is well worth the hype and investment, both for lunch and dinner. In my visits there I've tried (and genuinely have no critique for,) the following items:  LUNCH: Warm Homemade cookies (hold me, so perfect);  gnocchi with wild mushrooms (i dont even like gnocchi and i inhaled this);  the sandwich combos, chicken, garlic meatball, and prime rib sandwiches were all unreal.  I have no negative things to say about their lunch and for the price, i cannot believe the value/size/ and of course, undeniable quality of the food. I mean all in with tip if you dont get an alco beverage, you're looking at under 30, and honestly any other place in calgary downtown with even a fraction of that quality will be aroound the same for sitdown lunch - 16-25 for the meal. Might as well posh it up and treat yourself to Charcut.  The service, both at lunch and at dinner is impeccable - knowledgeable, attentive but not pesky, and friendly without being insincere.   DINNER:  Oysters - the tomato mignonette is ace, and fresh grated horseradish is always a great touch. for reference, i despise raw or even pickled tomatoes, and yet i loved this mignonette.   Charred octopous - full flavored and non chewy, loved the balance with the sausage it was totally worth it  kitchen pickles - ok pickles sound lame, but really, they are so good and so refreshing  bison brisket - mmmmmmmmmmmmm - end of that  butcher steak - standard, argentinian style skirt steak with chimichurri (which is more herbal than spicy compared to a regular chimichurri).   Prime rib - i dont need to tell you about this, you already know. and unbelievably reasonable at $4.50 an oz.   we've also tried their creamed corn, poutine and charcut potatoes as sides.  the potatoes are AMAZING (everything else is also good). its the kind of thing where it's almost as good as the steak itself without stealing spotlight.    basically what i'm saying is this place is worth the hype, and i'll get into fisticuffs with anyone who says otherwise. thanks to the chef and his wonderful staff both FOH and BOH for always making it a consistent experience."}
{"text":"On our last day visiting Banff/Calgary, we found Charcut on the Eater list. Our server and the majority of dishes we had were great.   However, upon arriving at the restaurant early in the evening the hostess was very unfriendly. We didn't have reservations and she made us feel completely unwelcome, even tho the restaurant just opened for the evening and was completely empty. In fact it was pretty empty throughout our entire dinner! Honestly, because of her attitude we were two seconds from walking out and trying out another restaurant on the Eater list.  Ultimately we were glad to stayed. Our server more than made up for her lack of hospitality. We got duck Poutine, Sausage Burger, Asparagus, and Pasta. The poutine and sausage burger were out of this world good!! Our favorite Poutine thus far. Sausage burger was a unique spin, paired wonderfully with an egg. Our server suggested we cut the burger in half and letting the yolk run through the middle. Also, they had home made pickles that were crisp. The acidity really helped balance our palettes from the heavy poutine and burger. Loved the presentation, they served everything but the pasta on a charred cutting board.  .They had an open kitchen concept at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been back many times for lunch, and finally had the opportunity to come for dinner tonight.  It was AWESOME!!!  Great beer selections and awesome menu. We had the beet salad, steak, fiddlehead ferns and duck fat poutine.  The fiddlehead ferns were delicious...I probably could have done without the poutine LOL (also delicious though!).  The service was great - very attentive, they addressed us by name from our reservation, Chef Connie stopped by to make sure everything was OK with our meal.  I love Charcut!"}
{"text":"We visited Charcut upon recommendation of a fellow Yelp reviewer.  The recommendation was spot on!  The cast iron skillet baked rolls were so moist & wonderful.  They tasted homemade...definitely fresh.  The racletta cheese was creamy & a beautiful compliment to the rolls.  The bone marrow & escargot au gratin were certainly different but quite tasty.  For our entrees, we had the roast chicken (quarter) with carrots & duck bacon, and the butcher chuck steak.  We chose poutine and polenta for our sides.  Honestly, I, personally, was not impressed with the poutine.  We see it quite often in Calgary.  The polenta was creamy & a nice pair to the roasted chicken.  The roasted chicken had a nice lemony flavor to it and was moist & tender.  My colleagues raved about the butcher steak, too.  Located right across Centre street from the Marriott hotel in downtown Calgary, many of my colleagues had been to many of the restaurants in the area but none had been to Charcut.  It was definitely a great find!  Thanks for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"The truffle poutine was phenomenal! The food was all excellent. The waiter was knowledgeable, kind, and attentive. We reserved a table of 6 for a special occasion and thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Charcut, on the house, complimentary of chefs Connie and John.  What happen was that  we had dinner there a few months ago and it was disappointing and I gave Charcut a negative review as a result.  To my surprise, I was contacted by someone from their management team and offered a complimentary return visit to make up for our lackluster experience.  They said that they want another opportunity to show what they can do.  My first thought was, \"Yikes, how did you find me?\"  My second thought was that if the meal is compted, am I obligated to sugarcoat the review?  But they said to write anything I want.  Now how many restaurants you know will do this for their guests?   Most of the time they'll void the offending dish or buy you a dessert, if you're lucky.  Needless to say, I accepted their offer.  So earlier this evening at Charcut, as we were looking over the menu, our waiter informed us that Connie has prepared a series of dishes for us.  \" Let's do it,\" I said.  First came a home-made bison sausage, followed by a raclette with house-baked brioche buns.  Then came a roasted heirloom beets salad with soft goat cheese, a dish that wowed the judges on Top Chef Canada.  It also wowed us cause normally I'd avoid beets if I could but  the dish was so delicate, I couldn't get enough of it.  After that came the Charcuterie board with house-cured salami, sausage, mortadella, pork crochettes, and a jar of chicken-liver pate.  My girlfriend and I struggled with this mountain of food and we ate most of it because it was really, really good.  \"That was some meal, huh,\" my girlfriend said.  \"Honey, that's just the appetizers,\" I explained.  You should have seen the look on her face,lol.   For our entree, Connie sent out a platter with half a roast chicken, a sliced hanger steak with chimichurri sauce,  a poutine with fries that were cooked in duckfat and cheese curds that were imported from Quebec, grilled asparagus, and heirloom carrots.  And for good measure, a plate of pasta in a spicy tomato sauce followed.  Yeah, I hit the wall with the poutine, nevermind my girlfriend who stared at the platter with bewilderment.  As good as it was, we barely finished the platter and hardly touched the pasta.  \"You think that's it?\" my girlfriend asked?  \"I think there's still dessert.\" I said.  \"No,no,no,\" she cried, \"I don't think I can do it!\"  The dessert platter came with a couple of icecream sandwiches made with homemade chocolate-chip cookies, a frozen terrine made from a hazelnut mousse, and a mason jar filled with cheescake and rassberry compote.   Yeah, that was a ridicules amount of food.  It was enough for four people.  Needless to say, we couldn't eat it all.  I mean there was just  my girlfriend and I.  As well, my girlfriend is a light eater and a very picky one at that.  But the fact that she ate as much as she did is a testament to the quality of food at Charcut.    For Connie to invite us back after we slagged her shows a high degree of passion and pride in her work.  And the food tonight showed a high level of skill in her craft.  With such a potent combination, my money is on her winning 'Top Chef Canada.'   How can she lose.  On a footnote, althought the service has always been excellent when we visited Charcut,  tonight the service from our waiter, Hunt, was exceptional according to my girlfriend.  She goes as far as to say that Hunt is the best server that she's ever had in Calgary since coming back from Hong Kong three years ago.  She should know cause for the ten years that she was in Hong Kong, she worked as a manager and corporate trainer for a company that has forty-five restaurants, and counting, under its banner."}
{"text":"As I write this, I am suffering from the biggest food hangover from Charcut Roast House.  I went for lunch with two of my friends from work, and were all in agreement that an extra $5 or less per person for lunch is totally worth it, when you get an unbelievable meal like today.  Our experience started when a pleasant waitress came by and offered us still or sparkling water (nice touch!).  When we got into our menu, we saw that they have homemade sodas.  There was about six different types to choose from, so I chose what I considered the most unique, which was a Jalopeno Basil soda.  It sounds weird, but the truth is, it was extremely tasty and refreshing.  It was served in a tall, thin icy glass.  Other flavors that were available today were: strawberry, raspberry, vanilla and lemongrass ginger.  Lunch - we all had a really tough time with the menu, because everything sounded so fabulous.    I ended up choosing the \"Charcut Lunch All At Once\" which came with their soup of the day (a golden tomato bisque), the daily sandwich (which was a beautiful pulled beef sandwich), a pickle and a bag of warm cookies (which I upgraded for $2 to a cheesecake).  My one friend got the same, and my other friend got the meatball sandwich with soup and baked cookies.    First the soup:  The daily soup changes daily, but my experience of THIS golden tomato bisque soup is that it was FULL of flavor.  Even though it was tomato, it was yellow in color (hence the golden, I guess) and to me, it didn't taste like tomato, but something much, much better.  I know that's not really helpful, because the flavor is hard to describe.  But it is savoury, flavorful and delicious.  All I can say is - don't miss out on the soup!  The pickle - delicious.  It tastes like a home made pickle.  I ate it all, and was glad it was on my plate.  'nuff said...  The sandwich... mmmmm barbeque sauce was tasty, the beef was so tender you barely had to chew it (but I did, to aid in the digestion process).  The sandwich was small, about a 3\" square on foccacia bread.  All of us were moaning in delight while we were eating it, with a raised eyebrow, nodding in approval as we looked at each other.  Seriously, seriously good.  The parmesan fries were REALLY good.  I have read reviews raving about the parmesan fries.  If I had a choice of soup or fries, I would have taken the soup.  However, as far as fries go, they were extremely tasty.  What was really impressive, is instead of ketchup, they provided a \"tomato jam\" in a bowl.  How was it?  Nom nom nom nom nom.....  delish!  Last, but not least.  The cheesecake.  OMG... the cheesecake.  I was so full by the time I left there, I had to take my cheesecake back to the office.  My colleague also got the cheesecake, and I figure it would only be fitting to share with you our IM thread when we both ate our dessert:  My colleague: Oh Dear God!  Me: Seriously??? Can you even believe how friggin' good that is?  How did they fit heaven in a cup that small?  My colleague: It was too much - even though I am full I could not wait!  Who knew heaven could be found right here at my desk?  Me: I know!! I plowed mine back, fighting with every spoonful because I'm so friggin' full.  but I couldn't put my spoon down.  My colleague: :) does not begin to describe how this makes me feel.  Me: I mourned a little when I threw the little paper cup in the trash....  My colleague:   Broken heart icon is flashed on my screen.  The short story here, #Charcut made three women very, very happy today.  What a way to start the long weekend!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best tasting and diverse carnivore meals I've had the pleasure to eat, and the service and friendliness of staff was incredible...very sincere and they love their job!  This was my 1st visit to Calgary in 2 years and I asked one of the fellows I worked with today what the best carnivore restaurant in Calgary and he recommended Charcut. I'm glad he did.  I ate at the eating bar, right in front of the prep and cooking staff, and the meat locker! It was a nice surprise as to how friendly they were and they explained every dish they prepared. Having worked in restaurants before it was easy to see that the kitchen operated like a well oiled machine.  I had the pig head mortadella, grilled sourdough bread, and bison brisket...the meats were a first for me. The presentations and taste were incredible. The folks sitting next to me ordered a mix of salume which included sausage and rabbit confit. They offered me a taste of which I was more than happy to oblige...I've never had rabbit confit and it was very nice.  I'd return in a heartbeat, but I fly out in the morning...who knows when I'll be back to Calgary, but you can bet that I will return to Charcut!  Well done all!"}
{"text":"Our Team Lead took us to Dinner here to celebrate a project milestone and to say Thank You for a job well done. Janet is a bit of a foodie and also really wanted to try CHARCUT, especially on an expense account.   CHARCUT Roast House is basically an upscale urban rotisserie, with a lot of chef-driven buzz and Country French and Italian accents. This is also a \"local and sustainable\" place in which ingredients are sourced from small, artisan farmers and ranchers, with herbs harvested daily from their own garden. I appreciate that as a long-time Golden State resident, although the bio-dynamic pretense factor here was perhaps a little too dear for my taste. And what's with the bright red above the open kitchen counter?    CHARCUT has 2 wine lists, their regular one and a \"upon request\" reserve selection. I suppose that my biggest surprise (beside the wine list prices which are outrageous by Northern California standards) was the fact that their Canadian wine selection was so limited. Considering the superior quality vino that comes from places like the Niagra Peninsula and the Okanagan Valley, I don't understand why high concept foodie places that emphasized local and sustainable don't play to those strengths. The moral of this part of the story? If I want a nice and reasonably priced selection of Canadian wines to go with my Canadian meal, you'll find me at Earl's.  The food on the other hand was fabulous, while the service and atmosphere almost matched. My colleagues raved about their steak and my Share Burger (CHARCUT Style \"roasted garlic sausage patty, cheese curds, with a fried egg\") was even better. We also shared a number of appetizers (whose selection escapes me) that tipped us off that there was much more culinary goodness to come.  While the others relished their desserts, I capped off my evening with a purchase of a jar of homemade Brassica mustard as a well received present for Gayle. And if both of us ever make it back to Calgary together, this is one place might find us for a special meal together."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend and turns out, my boyfriend had already eaten here (a somewhat pricey but 100% worth it dinner). I've heard it wasn't the cheapest. However, I was also told about their $15 weekday lunch special and it is to die for. We came for lunch while I was in town and I'm still licking my fingers every time I think about it. This is a 3-course lunch and insanely good. Everything tasted amazing and I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"What a great place! We went there for a romantic dinner and it was perfect. Charcuterie board, cheese plate, fresh bread, roasted tomatoes, a lots of wine. Our server was great and very friendly. We had an awesome time!"}
{"text":"Loved the chocolate chip cookies in a bag to take home! Nice atmosphere, it's cool that you can see into the kitchen. Delicious tomato soup and sandwich. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OK, I've been to Charcut 3 times now and I don't know what all the fuss is about. Yes, the beer list is impressive. I can go to Craft Beer Market for an impressive beer list. The food here is just OK. My wife thought her prime rib was full of gristle and difficult to cut with a steak knife. Each time we've been to Charcut we've walked away unimpressed."}
{"text":"Amazing.  we ordered 10 oz of prime rib, the souvei pork, spicy salad, bread&cheese, lorenzo, and for desert some kind of pumpkin cake with cray cray ice-cream.  All in all it was the best meal for a moderate to fancy fine dining price.    We had different meat preferences and they were ignored.  Some wanted well done, and I wanted medium.  Everything seemed to come well-done :(   The pork was very fatty, at least some of the fat needs to be trimmed before doing the sou-veed, as no fat escapes the bag, so a lot of fat is left and not rendered from the pork.  a baked half clove of garlic and a baked apple were amazing as condiments with fresh salt and this wacky gravy, horseradish,bakedwhitebeans.  The wait times were a little ridiculous for a monday night, we spent almost 2 hours to eat.  The waiter was the best waiter i've ever had, and I don't think I could tip him enough for the service offered."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced. Cocktail was good and coffee gelato for dessert was outstanding. Disappointed but ate there as I stayed in the adjoining hotel."}
{"text":"Amazingly refreshing menu items. Great service and fun ambiance. What's not to love?  My 5 reasons for the 5 star rating: 1 the charcuterie board is always changing but the pigs head mortadella, pate and jerky were so different and flavorful. 2 the lamb is a must!!! 3 duck fat anything is great but on Brussel sprouts it's done right 4 beet salad and goat cheese is a common combination but the mint and walnuts are a nice finish 5 the caramel dessert makes a non sweet person smile"}
{"text":"I have been to Charcut a number of times for lunch, and they were all delicious. I think that their lunches are so amazing for the price for what you get, and you get a little bag of cookies to go for some of the lunch specials! So cute! Their tiny pig paper clips are so cute too.  I always make reservations for lunch, just in case they get super packed - I recommend you do too if you are working downtown and stepping out for lunch! You can make the reservation online or over the phone which make it super easy.  I haven't tried the place yet for dinner, but it is definitely on my list of places to try for a fancy night out."}
{"text":"Woof. What an experience at highly recommended Charcut. I'm told that the chef won Canada's top chef, and I can see exactly why. Great food, great service, and a great location.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Charcut is wonderfully located, but that's complimented by excellent service and an atmosphere that can cater to just about any party. My group of three were able to have comfortable conversation while larger parties elsewhere could up the noise level without disturbing others. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Behold, friends, the full Charcut Board:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg&select=HmnAamjhVIX6lzWIKn7NMA  For $36, this could have easily covered three meals, and it was an awesome way to get a taste for all of the wonderful items that Charcut dishes up. Well worth the cost. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  This was very, very good stuff, and my whole dining party had rave reviews with regard to their dishes. As a pretty tried and true carnivore, I like to think I have it pretty well put together when it comes to having a taste for good meats, but each and every one of my four offerings was a unique experience. Perfect seasoning, thinly sliced, and complimented by the mustard seeds and fresh bread. Excellent. Dual Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Charcut is absolutely excellent, and it's only because there was some good nearby competition that I can't give it a perfect rating. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Oh man, I was SO EXCITED to try Charcut for the first time. I have heard so much about this place, and as a lover of charcuterie I feel like this place is the Holy Grail of cured meats and cheeses. The idea is that you do a family style/sharsies meal as most of the menu items are large portions and probably too much of one thing for you to want to eat yourself.  Between the four of us we had the shaved artichoke, zucchini, grizzly gouda salad, two orders of beet salad with goat cheese, rotisserie chicken, the large sized Charcut board and the handcut fries with truffle gravy and cheese. Turns out that was wayyy too much for the four of us, but we had a hell of a time trying to polish it all off. Everything was amazing (except maybe the zucchini salad, they really skimped on the artichokes) but the grizzly gouda was probs the best cheese I have ever eaten in my life. The charcuterie board was phenomenal. There was such large a variety of in house cured meats and fish. If you go in to get just one thing- make it the Charcut! It's what they are famous for and it definitely didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Super trendy, cool menu. Great vibe and service. Started with bitter greens and buffalo mozzarella with crispy pig ear, the pig was a bit tough to chew but it was a very nice starter. Followed that with a country sausage that was had a great flavour. Nice big portion of parmesan fries as well. Definitely hit this spot if you're in the vicinity."}
{"text":"My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary with a meal at CHAR CUT Roast House. We hoped that the positive reviews we had read about would be true.  Their motto is \"Evolving Simple Ingredients\" which by our account was true. They could add \"Most Delicious\". Our entire meal; from the beets with goat cheese to the  fresh made salami and also the rotisserie chicken were all in the outstanding category.  We had the opportunity to sit at the \"chef's table\" bar in front of the kitchen. Our opinion of the preparation environment was professional, intelligent and happy. We were very happy to be part of the food preparation arena. Our questions and conversation with all of the team were met with a welcomed passionate response, even in the heat of their work.   We arrived at 5:30 on a Tuesday evening to a moderately busy restaurant and when we left the place was full. We could see that our next visit would require reservations well in advance. The Char Cut was one of the best restaurants we have had the pleasure of eating at and recommend it highly. Lastly we would like to add that Yvan our host shared the spirit of the kitchen throughout the restaurant. He made us feel special and cared for throughout the evening without being intrusive. Alex, our server was friendly, knowledgeable and flexible in meeting our every request.  We cannot wait till we can return.   P.S. We really appreciated their use of local ingredients."}
{"text":"I went to Charcut for the first time last month. I really liked it but a few comments:  1) Honestly this is my fault for not listening to the waitress, but the pig head mortadella plate was huge! As my dining companion wasn't really interested in it, I was left to myself to devour it (and devour it I did). Definitely more an appetizer for 4 people.  2) The truffled duck fat french fries poutine was amazing, but on the salty side (and I love me my salt). Crispy thin-ish fries (my preference), real cheese curds, a light gravy (as opposed to the dark beefy gravy that is popular in Alberta for poutines), slight hint of truffle. Yum.  3) Mains were very good - my dining companion had the half roast chicken, which was perfectly cooked with crispy skin, and came with a side of salad. I had a thick rib pork chop on a bed of I think it was cheesy bacon barley grits. Pork chop was perfect - cooked medium, was still a bit pink inside and very juicy with a nice char on the fat layer. The grits were good, very rich - it was a neat texture, a little like saucy mini spaetzle bits - but again it was on the salty side.  4) Another reviewer mentioned this as well - the food is very rich but there aren't many other healthy and cheap options to balance it out. I know the menu changes regularly but when we were there, the salad options were expensive, leading me to think that they would be a full meal, and there wasn't really anything green in the table sides - there was the poutine, I think also a sweet potato option or maybe it was squash, which to be fair are vegetables that I don't really like to begin with. It would have been nice to see something like pan-fried Brussels sprouts or garlicky spinach or braised carrots.  5) Service was really spotty even though the restaurant was probably only a third full.   6) Decent wine list including lots of by the glass options, but on the pricey side.  7) I love that they have an after-dinner cheese list. If only I had room to eat some.   Overall, I liked Charcut a lot and would definitely try it out again."}
{"text":"This was our first time at the Charcut Roast House. The food was absolutely delicious! We had the PEI oysters to start & the Charred Octopus. The Octopus was succulent and flavourful. The tomato sauce complimented very well.  For my main course, I had the prime rib which was amazing. Cooked to perfection.   Dessert; I had salted caramel and milk chocolate pudding crunch - it's a must try even for those without a sweet tooth.   Overall, the food and ambience was amazing at Charcut - I would definitely come back another time."}
{"text":"Food was average in quality and high in price. Id expect more from a restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"On a recent quick trip with short notice to YYC, I was extremely appreciative that Yelp's Queen of Calgary was able to score us a reservation at Charcut.  I'd been hearing about this restaurant for ages: and all good things!  I'd heard about how wonderfully talented Chef Connie is, how amazing the menu is and how it changes daily, how cool the ambiance is, how friendly the staff is, etc... so as you can imagine, I had high expectations!  Luckily, Charcut delivered!  Since I'm prego, I couldn't partake in the cocktails, but as an alternative to a mocktail, our waiter recommended a Grizzly Paw soda.  There was a huge selection of flavors and I went with the Ginger Beer and I really enjoyed it!  Wendy and I started with a special appetizer that was some sort of pork pate served with toast.  Admittedly, I'm not the hugest pork eater, but I tried it and really liked it!  From there, we shared a chopped romaine salad, which consisted of crisp lettuce, cucumber, garden mint, yogurt dressing, and Ricotta Salata.  It was delicious!  We also shared the infamous duck fat fried poutine as a side, which was ridiculously addicting... (it also happened to be my first time trying poutine)!  Wendy went with the steak option that evening, which happened to be Flank Steak.  I chose the Grilled Whole Fish, which was Rainbow Trout.  Mine was a bit on the dry side, so I filled my belly with some of it, but ate more than my fair share of the poutine until I was so full that I felt like rolling home that evening!    Unfortunately, neither of us saved room for dessert, which was a bummer because all of the options sounded amazing.  I guess I'll just have to make my way back here next visit to Calgary... and then the key will be to save room for dessert!    Pork lover or not, you can't go wrong at Charcut... unless of course you're a vegetarian in which case this may not be your best option!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy good, but you better like meat! Wow. Went as a group and had a meat platter and the beat/goat cheese for appies. Then we ordered this ginormous burger covered in cheese. It fed over 8 people. I'd like to come back and try a few other things. Maybe a few of their lighter items. But it was super tasty and the service was great. Pretty pricey."}
{"text":"After a multi-year hiatus, I returned to Charcut for lunch.  They have a great option where you can order an express \"lunch all at once\".  The option i chose includes their daily soup and sandwich, a pickle, parmesan fries and a bag of warm cookies to go.    That particular day, the soup was a butternut squash and the sandwich was a philly cheese steak, which I was SO excited about.  The soup was okay but the sandwich was a disappointment.  It was bland and could not be saved by the melted cheese and sauteed peppers.  It's a shame.  The fries were crispy and had the perfect amount of parmesan on top.  My favourite part were the bag of warm cookies to go as I was able to enjoy them at my office.  But, alas, delicious fries and warm chocolate chip cookies aren't enough to get me back to Charcut."}
{"text":"How disappointing. We had been to Charcut about two years ago with great food and memories, so after the Matt Good concert we decided to splurge arriving at 11 pm.  We ordered a dozen oysters which were delicious, fresh, and served with a lovely mignonette and not enough fresh horseradish.  It took a while to get a spoon though.  We ordered the poutine, persian salad, and raclette cheese, and my hubby got the prime rib.  The poutine was divine, the persian salad was strange, lots of romaine and probably house made pickled peppers, but so spicy (and i love spicy) that it made me cough.   I'm vegetarian so I didn't taste the prime rib, but it was served well under the medium rare request, very rare.   Can't comment on the raclette cheese, as it never arrived.  When we asked for the bill, I mentioned that the cheese didn't come and that it could just be deducted from the bill.  The waiter was quite brusque and later slapped the bill down on the table without comment.  We spent 200.00 there on a Saturday night, and I'm sad to say the place has become complacent."}
{"text":"This place is hip, and modern. Perfect for a date night! The place is dim but still has warm lighting. My boyfriend and I decided to share the prime rib, duck fat poutine fries, and duck fat brussel sprouts since we weren't too hungry. Little did we know the portion was going to be HUGE! The fries were salty and savory. The brussel sprouts were crispy and cooked perfectly. And the prime rib was tender and juicy. It came with a whole roasted garlic (my fave!), salt, and horseradish. We ordered wine to sip on during dinner also. Everything in the meal was just so complementary, we couldn't let anything go to waste!   The waitress was very helpful with our questions when ordering. Keep in mind the prime rib is ordered by the ounce (4.5 CAD/ounce) and the sides are ordered separately. It was a very romantic meal for two!"}
{"text":"Absolutly great experience. Had a place at the Open Kitchen Bar. The team did an amazing job. Was so interesting to see what they are doing. Had the full charchuterie plate. So much great stuff! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Went Tues Feb 22nd for a romantic dinner.  Located near the Calgary tower, and attached to St. Germanie hotel, small, nice, new restaurant, it was busy, and a little noisy.  They do play music in the background, and more for a small group, than couples.  Now, onto the food.  We had the charcut meat board for an appetizer, and the pretzel.  Both amazing.  Meats were fresh, flavor and I believe made inhouse.  The 2 of us couldn't finish all the 'cold cuts', probably better for 3 or more.  For main courses we had the spring creek skirt steak, and mussels with pasta.  Steak was flavorful for a skirt steak, and mussels were huge.  Tried the cheesecake in a jar for dessert, small but tasty.  Overall, food is good, would try the prime rib next time.  Nice upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"Charcut Roast House was on the list of 100 Best Restaurant in Canada, looking through all the Yelp pictures...I was determined to go here during my visit.  My friend made a reservation for our party of seven about three days in advance and there were plenty of availabilities.  Great decision!  The prime rib was probably one of the best cooked piece of meat I've had in my life.  Ohh, it was perfectly medium-rare and juicy.  All you needed was a little sprinkling of sea salt and nothing else because the natural beef flavor shined through.  The only thing weird was that they pre-cut our meat for us--even though my friend and I were sharing a 12 oz. cut, I wish they didn't do that.  We added the onion ring and marrow to the order, the onion rings were sweet and melted when you bit into it.  I was expecting bone-in marrow but it came fried, which was very interesting.  You bite into a fritter-like batter and the fattiness of the marrow runs out, I couldn't decide if I liked it or not and concluded I didn't because there was too much fried elements.  Also had the duck fat poutine with an egg on top.  The poutine was amazing, the melted cheese curds with the richness of the duck and gravy...*drooling*.  My only gripe is that the $4 egg was overcooked.  If you are going to charge us the same price as a carton of egg, please do it right.  I want it soft-proached that oozes over the top of the fries.  I don't normally eat more than 6 oz. of meat but I wanted more.  I would definitely return in the future because I dream about that prime rib all the time."}
{"text":"Their Express Lunch Option is just perfect! it's delicious, affordable, and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies when you order!  WHATTTT! just awesome! amazing every time!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've ever had in Calgary. Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Me lo esperaba mejor, caros los vinos, la comida buena pero por lo menos en mi visita muy ruidoso y los ba√±os muy sucios, pienso que hay mejores lugares en la zona"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely incredible! The cold-cuts are deliciously unique. The service was excellent especially given the fact that we were a large group of about 20.   The downside for me was the noise level but I guess that's the kind of place it is designed to be."}
{"text":"First meal at Calgary, first time trying poutine, bone marrow with escargot, and grilled whole fish. And..the meal turned out to be better than expected! It was such a joy to enjoy a good meal with good service after a 3 hr flight and being late to the restaurant for more than an hr and still able to get good food.   We don't have poutine here in LA, we're all about the heart-attack chili cheese fries, but this is like the canadian version of it but with gravy and cheese curd. It was served on a sizzling hot cast iron and fries was cooked with duck fat, though it sounds a little too greasy, but it was goood! It was soo flavorful, i don't even know how to describe it, and most of all, it was still burning your tongue on the last bite.   Since it was a late night dinner, we just ordered the poutine, bone marrow and grilled fish. Don't expect big portion here, it's more like the presentation and delicacy over quantity. The bone marrow came second, it was baked with some parmesan cheese on top and few pieces of escargot, and served with a few pieces of garlic toast. They give you a side of sea salt on the side, but it was salty enough to be eaten with the toast. I never had something like this before, but it was a very good dish. esp good with you eat it with a little of the parsley salad on the side so it doesn't taste as greasy. Very special dish that you don't get in many places.   Then comes the grilled whole fish, which was the rainbow trout. It was served with some grilled veggies, grilled lemon, and some sprouts. Very flavorful and perfectly grilled fish with some very light tasting veggies so it kinda balance the flavors out. If you're not used to eating whole fish, this may be a still complicated for you cuz there are lots of small bones in the fish.   Overall, i think this was a great meal, esp after i've been to other places and tried their poutines, Charcut has the best ones! And not to mention that service was great, the server explained almost all the menu items to us and gave us recommendations, decor and atmosphere is great, definitely a good place to go to on a date or just friends get together."}
{"text":"If it was just the food, I would have given them 5 stars but for service attitude, I think 3 is more than enough. When you go to a restaurant like Charcut, with lots of great reviews on their food, and one of the tops in Calgary, you expect everything to be just at the highest level; unfortunately I did not get the feeling of a valued guest from the level of service we received; food was amazing though; we were a group of 8 and probably that's why the server felt she already had the tip so no great attitude shown; we shared 5 of the main dishes and also tried their Charcut Board and Shrimp appetizer; all were amazing, definitely tasty and fresh with great design. We also ordered few glasses of different wines and they were also great. We had kids with us and this restaurant  is definitely a family friendly one, kids enjoyed their mini burgers and fries. The only down side as mentioned was service, I was always asking for my water to be filled in, no customer appreciation shown or at least felt by us From our server, etc. I definitely recommend the restaurant to friends though. Price was really high, and that's what you expect from a restaurant like Charcut."}
{"text":"after all the hoopla over Charcut, i thought i'd try it out. it's eh, just ok and frankly quite overpriced. nice decor. the appetizers -- especially the pighead mortadella -- are quite good. the squash side dish was not fully cooked and rather dry. the main course slow roasted chicken was juicy but probably not as tasty as Pollo Rico in Arlington, VA, which costs less than half the price. it has the ambiance of a restaurant in New York but needs to work on the taste and quality of dishes."}
{"text":"Went there for a group dinner last night and the experience was not what i would have expect.. We were eating off the group menu and the food was horribly salty .. I do not expect an arugula salad to be so salty i couldnt even finish it. The service was decent. But I have paid half the price for food at a pub that taste better than this. I will not be back for along time."}
{"text":"SIGH  I've heard great things about Charcut. Amazing things. People rave about it. I've been to the Alleyburger (before it became a gongshow, and then a truck) - auctioned off my burger because I don't eat them.  But my visit was really average. And that's sad. Because I wanted a great experience like everyone else seems to have.  I've avoided Charcut because I don't eat red meat (nothing that comes from a mammal, pollo-vegetarianism... whatever you want to call it)  But I've heard good things about the lunch and there's a sandwich on the menu I can eat, sans bacon bits. So, a friend and I went there for lunch!  It started out great... seated quickly, server was along in seconds to give us water and take drink orders (we stuck with water anyhow).  After we ordered, the way the server picked up the menus seemed kind of rude. I know that sounds funny, but it was just my impression.   I guzzled my water pretty quickly. It never got refilled.  Food came - sandwich was awesome and huge, although a little greasier than I expected. But the parmesan fries were SALTY! And, for anyone who knows me, I love salt. Love, love it. So, for me to say they were salty is huge.  We had to flag down the server to get the bill. And again to pay the bill.  So, overall, the experience was pretty average. I was expecting more. And since it's very limited as to what I can eat, my sister (same meat lifestyle as me) has warned me off going for dinner. So, I may not be back.   Which disappoints me.  (16/30)"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here the other night for our anniversary. I made a reservation but in the back of my head thought \"It's Monday night I probably don't need a reservation\". Wrong. While I may have been ok without a reso. the place was pretty full at 7:00 so not worth the risk of showing up without one.  Our server was great. She was well versed in the menu and answered our questions with ease. She was right there when we needed refills and non-existent when appropriate. One note about the menu from our server was on the brussels sprouts. She told us that even people that don't like sprouts like the ones here. My wife doesn't like brussels sprouts but we ordered them. Our server was right. My wife said they tasted like french fries.  To start we tried the house pickles. They're only slightly brined and still quote crunchy. They don't make you pucker. They're also served with carrots and a slice of jalapeno pepper. So overall there's just a slight amount of heat.  For dinner my wife had the steak and I went with the bison brisket. We tried each other's meals and both were excellent. For sides we had the sprouts, as mentioned, and the Charcut potatoes. The portions are a good size for the (higher) dollar.   Lastly we shared a sticky toffee pudding with bourbon gelato. When they say bourbon, they mean bourbon so be prepared if that's not your drink because its right in your face.  Appies run from $8-17. Meals are in the low $30's but the bison brisket will run you $42 at the highest end. The couple of beers I had were $9 each. All in with tip our meal came to just over $170 for the two of us. A larger tab than most restaurants, but still lower than when we were at Hy's in early December for a similar meal."}
{"text":"Tried Charcut for our wedding anniversary this year. Our half-size charcuterie board was piled high with lamb ham, salami, and pig head mortadella, sprinkled with Gruyere. We had to take a lot of it home to leave room for our mains: pan-seared PEI halibut fillet in polenta, and a medium rare chimichurri butcher steak with wild arugula. Our shared side dish was summer squash with fennel and goat cheese. We finished with blackberry cheesecake and salted caramel and chocolate pudding. Everything was oh so good! A well-chilled bottle of 2012 Joie Muscat paired nicely with it all. Seated near the kitchen, the vibe was a bit noisier than I would've liked. But they noted from our reservation the special occasion, and they piped a calligraphic dark chocolate 'Happy Anniversary' on my wife's dessert plate. Attention to detail? In spades."}
{"text":"Food was quite good and our server was prompt but we were left with a bad taste as several staff member tried to rush us out of our table....lots of tables empty around us.....as the next party had arrived. Our group of 4 had never experienced this in any restaurant ever! As we tried to discuss this with staff on the way out, that there must be better ways to treat guests, they became argumentative with us. won't be back service has to rise above this standard."}
{"text":"I came here with three of my favorite people in the world that I don't see very often, so it was bound to be a good dinner anyhow. But still...  Probably one of the best carnivore experience I've had, Ever. I'm a chicken person myself, but since we were in a steakhouse and everything... We ordered the spare ribs, Charcut-style burgers, steak and two orders of duck-fat fried poutine - all to share. Very delicious. I had a medium-body red recommended by our server - a great complement, so thanks!   Finally topped off with the milk chocolate parfait, which would be an absolute crime if you don't order it.  Again, did I mention - one of the best carnivore experience ever?"}
{"text":"I've been there twice and thoroughly enjoyed myself each time. The food and cocktails are amazing, and the restaurant has a great ambiance. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"A great spot for lunch! We had their all at once sandwich combo. It was awesome!! It was a beef sandwich, the beef was tender, great texture, and the BBQ sauce on top was flavourful and not overwhelming. It came with a seafood chowder. Lots of seafood in there and it was a really light cream base, which was a perfect start of the meal. The Parmesan fries was not bad as well, crispy, but lacked some seasoning, and the house ketchup was too sweet.  We also ordered 2oz of roasted ham each on the side. Those were not good. Tasted like the Black Forest ham at the supermarket and super expensive as well, not worth it.  Overall, great experience. Will come back."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful modern restaurant showing off the great tastes of Alberta. Not something a student would go to on a daily basis, but certainly a wonderful place to drop into for a birthday celebration!  The wine list is pretty extensive and our service while slow, was incredibly courteous. I think a part of the slow service is so that we can enjoy our time there, the ambiance and the great smells.  Portions are of course quite small, and I am sure many people will complain that it is too expensive. But that's the point! It's an upscale restaurant with a great Head Chef (pretty famous too now!) and it is meant to be a pricey but unique dining experience.  I say the 'taste' of Alberta, because this place is all about the great meat. We had the very popular bone marrow, duck fat poutine, as well as pork belly and pork croquettes! We loved the food, loved the restaurant and I was constantly distracted by the wonderful kitchen that was very well run and very exciting to watch!   By the way... The food is quite salty. After all the mainstay IS cured meat.. Still excellent!"}
{"text":"We went for my friend's bday. My friend had never even watched Top Chef. She was pleasantly surprised and couldn't stop talking about it. I was confident that it would be as good as it gets, and I was not disappointed. :)   Wine selection- as high end as any 5 star I've visited. For summer, get the Joie Rose.  A nice, dry rose that is chilled like a white but has abundant flavours like a red.  To share:  1. Charcuterie board-unbelieveable. Pig's head and cheese to die for. (Yes, you get over the fact that it's pig's head after just one taste). Maybe it's the Polish in me? :)  2. Pickled Tuna w. Arugula-our only veggie. Uh-oh, but veggies were not our focus tonight! Tasty dressing. Tuna ok. Cute presentation, like every dish served!  3. Croquettes-yummy. Onion rings-delicious! 4. Duck poutine- the table fave and I never do duck! 5. Sausage-best I've tasted; not fatty at all.   Really wished that I could have ordered a full meal, but the three of us were almost full. In short, we picked every \"Top Chef selection.\"   By this time, we were full but we did a dessert trio. This was almost as wonderful as the rest of the meal. I loved all but the cheesecake, but only because it wasn't as sweet as I'd have liked. It's a personal preference, really.   My friend ordered a latte that came out before the dessert, but our pleasant waiter was more than happy to bring out a new one to replace the one that had become suddenly cold.    My mouth is still watering over the chocolate chip cookies.   Overall, service and Connie a definitive five star. She is even nicer and prettier in person. (Not that it matters, but just an fyi.)  Worthy of a 25% tip. The entire bill was no more than $162. I'd return to Calgary in a flash--not for the royals, not for the stampede, but for Charcut!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had one of the best experiences in a long time, great food, even better drinks and the staff rounded the the great night I really didn't want to leave. A huge thanks to the two people who made my night Jesse Boyd who has the best eyebrows in yyc and Debra who makes the best old fashioned south of the Yukon"}
{"text":"Charcut is our go-to place if we want to dine with great food and awesome service. Their lunch service provides a full balanced meal with 2 price points and their dinner service has a slight difference in terms of the type of sides (served family style) - yet still phenomenal to say the least. In the past, Connie De Sousa comes around to say hi at your table but with having another restaurant at East Village we haven't seen her much these past visits.   Charcut is great for meat eaters so if you are vegan, this is not the place for you.  They do accommodate gluten free eating so just let them know."}
{"text":"We walked across the street from our hotel to this place and absolutely loved the experience!    Good wine on tap (very sustainable) and incredible meats that can all be served family style which gives you a great opportunity to try several items.    Love the fish and chicken with great smokey flavors and so moist!"}
{"text":"I was helping to plan a small birthday celebration, and wasn't able to get online rezos for 6 for the Saturday so I was in a bit of a panic. Luckily, all worked out and our crew was seated together - and that was my last problem of the evening!  The menu we got was designed for sharing - and share we did! We got the chef's charcut platter, which was much more robust than we had been expecting... in a good way! It was overflowing with generous portions of lamb cuts and sausage, and all fantastic, although we had to order extra crostinis. It was a meat lovers paradise! We also sampled the pretzels, a steak, the fantastic poutine and so much more. Everything was  (I had been afraid that we didn't order enough food at the start, but we actually had the opposite problem - there was so much delicious stuff!).   Probably the highlight of the evening was that Connie herself came out to talk to everyone in the restaurant, table by table, and see how everything was. As a huge Top Chef fan, I was in food channel heaven, although it was a bit lost on our birthday boy.   I highly recommend it for service, food, and everything. Hands down, it remains one of the best restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Charcut for ages. I've never been around to try their infamous express lunch deals but finally made it happen during Stampede week.   We dropped by on a Thursday for lunch and didn't have any trouble grabbing a table. They have a pretty cute patio but only a few people were taking advantage of the 30+ degree weather. Everyone else took cover inside.   Service was decent although our waiter seemed to be all over the place. He asked if we were sharing (of course) so they brought everything out together on one platter. Beautifully presented and seriously so much food!  - Carrot and red pepper soup - the soup was incredible. No words could describe how good this was. Filling too.  - Wild greens with house vinaigrette - vinaigrette was tasty but the salad itself was pretty standard.  - Parmesan fries - so many fries. The house made ketchup was good. Wish they gave you two sauce cups.  - Kitchen pickles - you get two massive slices. Uber crunchy.  - Daily sandwich ($16.00) - it was a BBQ beef sandwich. The focaccia it comes on I didn't feel was a very good match. Both the meat and bread were soft so there was no contrasting textures, which it desperately needed.  - Daily spit-roasted and smoked rotisserie ($25.00) - this was slices of pork loin and was seasoned with cayenne, paprika, fennel and garlic. Pork loin is finnicky to deal with but this was quite moist and tender. The Dijon mustard sauce was sharp and you could taste the horseradish.  - Bag of warm cookies - we were too full to eat these so took them for a midnight snack. These were delightfully fresh. The pig paper clips are beyond cute.   It's a bit pricier than a typical lunch but great quality and totally worth it. I'd be there frequently if I worked downtown. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"First off I have to say that the service was great. Our poor waiter got stuck with us, a party of 7 and a cranky baby. Then the baby's dad had to take her upstairs to bed in their hotel room because she was so crabby and he wasn't able to make it back to the table for over an hour. The rest of us had wine, our dinners and more wine. So that his entree didn't get cold they did not make his entree until he could make it back. our server was so patient with us being at the table long after we should have been.   The food itself was also excellent. They make so much of their menu in house and it shows on the taste buds. I subtracted a star however for the wine list. The wines on it were all blech. Fortunately they offer 2 oz. pours so that you can taste different wines before committing to a bottle. This worked out well for us because we had to taste 4-5 before we found one that was drinkable. They need to revamp this ASAP."}
{"text":"One word : FANTASTIC!   I would rate a solid 4.5 - why the loss of a 1/2 star nothing horrible I assure you.  We arrived late... And we were in a rush! Our own fault and the staff were over the top accommodating! So great!!! Our server Heather comes highly recommended to any future diners by myself and Michael. We ordered a bottle of wine (DELICIOUS) and some food based off her recommendations right away! And delivery was super quick! We chose the small CHARCUT BOARD, a salad, Brussels sprouts and poutine.   The salad was arugula and fennel with buffalo mozzarella and it was delicious I think it was one of the best salads I've ever had, so fresh and bright! The meats were tasty  and it was piled high so plenary to enjoy but I longed for something to put them on bread, cheese, anything but it was simply meat and mustard very tasty mustard but I assumed the board would come with at least toasts. The photos I have seen seemed to suggest toasts and cheese and even other spreads were accompaniments although perhaps all must be ordered separately. The poutine?!?!  OMG to die for seriously there are no words get your coat and go try it right NOW!  Our Brussels sprouts were SUPER SALTY! I love Brussels sprouts but we could hardly eat them, they were the last to arrive and we were rushing so we didn't get to let Heather know until we were paying the bill. We let her know just so the kitchen would be aware in an offhanded comment not angry. Well as we were putting our coats on  not 2 minutes later the manager came by , apologized and gave us two bags of fresh baked cookies so we could take them with us to the play!!  AMAZING!  Thanks CHARCUT for a wonderful experience! Your food is delicious but your staff are the real treat! Such a delight!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience and ordered the butcher steak. Great presentation and food"}
{"text":"I've checked out Charcut several times over the years, and it's always been a solid, up(per)scale dining experience. I'm a fan of both the $15 sandwich lunch combo as well as the daily rotisserie ($25) combo. This visit however, I had the daily #15 sandwich combo, which was a philly cheese steak with shaved prime rib and caramelized onions and peppers. It was served with Parm fries, with a potato bacon soup. (Also included - a pickle and a bag of two cookies).   The Sandwich was really good - I have no complaints whatsoever and the flavor balance was spot on. The fries were really good as well, which was a nice surprise as I find most restaurants to be a bit hit and miss with the fries. The house ketchup is pretty good but I prefer the fries with mayo, which you can ask for. The mayo they served me was a blended flavoured mayo which was an excellent compliment for the fries. (As far as the fries with mayo habit I have, I blame my years living in Montreal.) The soup was also well executed.   I do, however, have to echo some of the sentiments that a few other reviewers mentioned about the service. For an \"upscale establishment\", I found the service to be lacking in authenticity and presence. I get the gut feeling that when they saw I looked unassuming or when I ordered the $15 lunch special, I was treated with a lower level of service that I would absolutely expect from a place as \"upscale\" as this one. Your mileage may vary, of course, but over the few occasions I've been here that has been a somewhat consistent thread.   Not to say the service is bad - the wait staff aren't rude or difficult. I have just come to expect more from a restaurant that wants to compete with the upscale dining scene.   But hey.... if we remember that this was a $15 dollar meal, all things considered, the experience was great.    Maybe next time I'll order the $25 dollar lunch and get better service!"}
{"text":"Lively, modern decor. Ate @ bar, bartenders impressive--very dedicated to their craft, friendly and efficient. Had zucchini w/goat cheese & pumpkin side as an appetizer. Delicious, generous. We were only 2, but menu clearly geared for group & sharing. Shaved artichoke salad looked good, but not much flavor. Chimichura (?) steak nice, but didn't compare to the unusual combo of flavors in sausage burger--best breakfast sandwich ever & fine for dinner too."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan.  I was disappointed that a place with a name like Charcut did not have more Charred Cuts of beef, which is what I expected, but I gave it a chance by ordering an appetizer and the rest is history.    Eating alone, and at the bar, I had the Piri Piri Linguica as an appetizer.  House made sausage, sliced, with a hard cheese - forget the type.  Excellent, and plenty to go around for myself and myself.    Watched the bartender make a mint julep.  He rolled the mint leaves in his palms and never muddled them.  I asked him why - he said it was Japanese style (who knew the Japanese would tell the Americans how to drink a mint julep - in Canada).  Then he poured it over crushed ice into a copper Woodford Reserve mint julep cup.  Yes, I know, not silver - but hey, it's Canadia, and they have Woodford, and fresh mint, and it's October.  At any rate, I asked him to make me one and I would be the judge - as I had just spent the previous week in New Orleans and had had my fair share of mint juleps.  He won.  Hands down.  Best mint julep I'd ever had.  And the presentation - I haven't seen someone do a real julep with the style and panache he showed in a long time.  Which reminds me - go here for drinks if nothing else.  These bartenders are absolutely outstanding.  They are true bartenders and mixologists, not just off the street stiffs mixing stuff in a shaker glass.  Was fun just to sit at the bar and watch them work.   Had the Chimmichuri steak with the truffle fries.  Everybody has truffle fries in Calgary.  I can't say these were the best, although they were far from the worst.  They had boar gravy over them, if I'm not mistaken, with some truly fantastic cheese melted over the top of that.  The fries came out I'm sure exactly the way they were supposed to, piping hot and full of greasy goodness - just maybe a bit too much greasy goodness for my American taste.  Personally, I could have done with the gravy on the side, not soaking my fries.  Perhaps that just me.    Steak was very good, chimmichuri sauce was excellent.  Steak was a sirloin, sliced on the plate, cooked perfectly.  Guy next to me had the prime rib and said it was fantastic, fyi.  So all in all, a great dinner.  The service was lively and fun at the bar, and the bartender was quite familiar with the menu and the dishes.  Only reason I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5 is simply a scaled basis on which I review restaurants in my head.  Calgary is full of incredible restaurants, and to earn a 5 star in my book means you've truly blown me away.  Charcut is very good, probably excellent, but so are many other places.  I did not feel particularly blown away by impeccable food and flawless service, but you cannot go wrong here.    Do not go here for beef.  Not that it isn't good, but if you're looking for a steakhouse this isn't it.  The reputation of the chef and the locally sourced, urban-rustic cuisine is what they're marketing here.  Prices are in line with the rest of Calgary.  Expect $65-85 CAD per person depending on alcohol consumption."}
{"text":"I planned a date night for when I was home from work a couple weeks ago, and after wanting to go to Charcut for quite some time, we finally made a reservation and did it.  We had an early reservation as we had tickets to a show after dinner.  I had mentioned that when I called in to book it, and also mentioned that my fiancee was lactose intolerant, asking if they would allow menu changes.  We arrived and were promptly seated.  Our server was Larae, and to our suprise she brought up the lactose allergy first thing and said they would make changes if necessary.  I was a chef for 12 years, my fiancee was a cook for 6 years, we have gone out to eat a lot as well, and neither one of us had ever heard of or seen a server knowing that information ahead of being told at the table.  Extra star for customer service, and we hadn't even gotten water yet!  We ordered our wine, appetizers and entrees.  Sitting there waiting for our food we looked around and took in the decor and atmosphere.  Our type of place for sure!  Relaxed feeling, casual, had the sense that the food would match the ambiance.  Our appetizers arrived and we were off to a good start.  Simple, clean, unfussy presentation and ingredients.  Chelsea ordered the house made pickles which included carrot, jalapeno, beets and pickling cucumber.  They were quite spicy with flavours of pickling spice.  I had a bite of each and had the jalapeno to myself.  I ordered the \"bread and melted cheese\"  what could possibly go wrong there?  Turns out nothing.  It arrived as described, warm brioche buns and a hot pot of melted cheese.  Needless to say, I didn't share mine with my lactose intolerant fiancee, so I dipped away until there was nothing left, and it was amazing!    Entrees stole the show though!  I had Bison brisket with wild boar bacon, served on creamy polenta and topped with sour cream.  Oh....my....  The meat was so tender, no fat, so flavourful.  Boar bacon, do I even need to describe how good boar bacon is?  No.  Moving on.  The polenta was cooked perfectly.  I am a bit of a polenta snob as many people think that cooking cornmeal is hard to screw up, but I have had my fair share of disappointing polenta.  This hit the mark.  Creamy, great texture and flavour.  The bison cooking juices and sour cream brought everything together.  An amazing meal.  Chelsea has the quarter roasted chicken and roasted potatoes cooked in bacon fat and topped with wild boar bacon.  She loved the dish, and even brought another serving home when she couldn't finish it.  The chicken was juicy and tender, not overcooked at all.  I picked away at the bacon fat potatoes as well.    Overall an amazing meal, fantastic service, price was as I thought it would be, and worth every penny!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Restaurant I have been to in Calgary.  We went there for Valentine's day, and had the best dining experience ever. From the moment we were greeted at the door to the Orchid they gave my wife on the way out, everything was perfect. You owe it to yourself to try this place.  the chef here has been and is Canada's top chef and they are all well known in the foodie and tourism communities of Calgary and Canada.  Call and make reservations ahead of time, cause they can be solid booked for days!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this review is rife with bias. My dear friend has been working here forever, and Connie DeSousa once bought me a taco in Vancouver and I've been smitten ever since.  Nevertheless, being as objective as possible, I do actually love this place.   Things to love: - mortadella is made inside a deboned pig head. That's pig stuffed inside of a pig's face. It's on one hand a perverted abomination against nature, and on the other hand a delicious delight. - potatoes are deep fried in duck fat. - they're usually trying to switch things up (food, drinks, desserts) and to keep in tune with what's in season - charcut's been sewing itself deeper into the fabric of the Calgary community which I think is super cool"}
{"text":"Charcut is delicious.... and, at least the night I went, would have been extra delicious for someone who liked steak!  Personally, I'm not a big steak fan, and the chicken was good - not life changing, but good.  We went before a Vertigo Theatre show, so fairly early.  There were lots of tables, service was quick, server was very helpful and knowledgeable about drinks... overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try Charcut this past weekend for a friends birthday dinner. I was really excited given all of the glowing reviews, and as usual I checked the menu online beforehand and already had an idea of what I wanted to have. Unfortunately for me, the menu was slightly different when we arrived, so I was a little disappointed. If you're going to have the menu on your website, it should be updated accordingly.   Parking as usual was a colossal PAIN in the butt. I thought I read somewhere that you're able to use the parking lot below the hotel, however it was full when we arrived. A few of our friends had the same issue, and although this is not the restaurants fault, it certainly sets a tone for the evening when you're annoyed before you even walk in the door. We eventually found a spot over at the Calgary Tower and headed inside. I was impressed! The dim lighting with the red accents and open kitchen concept gave the restaurant a very classy, upscale feel.   The waiter who was tending to our table was excellent. He was around when we needed him and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. The wine list and cocktail menu was extensive, I opted for Prosecco and my boyfriend ordered beer. We also ordered a dozen oysters and they were delicious, as usual! I wish they had provided more fresh horseradish, but no big deal. We had a really (unusually) hard time deciding on an entree. To be honest I was less than thrilled with the menu because rather than ordering something as simple as a steak or some fish, our choices were either a gigantic steak meant to share or an entire fish (sides are a la carte and very carb heavy - think poutine, potatoes, etc). I would have loved the steamed mussels I saw on the menu online. Instead we ordered the Beet Salad to start, while I had the Slow Roasted Chicken and my boyfriend had the Pasta with White Wine & Clams.  Our food came out very quickly which was impressive given our party size and variety of dishes ordered. What bothered me was that every course was brought out by someone different, so they kept mixing up our orders and giving them to the wrong person. Not a huge deal, but with the dining experience they are claiming to provide and the price I'm paying, that's a small annoyance that just shouldn't happen. Our original server did check in from time to time to see how we were doing and topped up our drinks, which was great.  The beet salad was excellent! I enjoyed the arugula and the soft goat cheese that accompanied the red & golden beets. We also shared the Raclette Cheese with our friends and it was heavenly! The sweetness of the pan bread complimented the sharp cheese very well. However, the dish itself was quite small. Surprisingly, I was impressed with my chicken. It's not something I EVER order at restaurants but it was done very well and was really juicy, and the house cured bacon on top was so crispy and delicious! My boyfriend, however, really did not like his pasta (which is rare for him!). I also tried it and while it wasn't BAD, it certainly wasn't on par with what I would expect from this restaurant, given the reputation and price. It was dry, overcooked (noodles stuck together) and lacked flavor. Our friends had a variety of dishes that we were lucky enough to taste - the Share Burger was absolute perfection, Poutine with Truffle Oil was delicious although slightly heavy, and the huge Steak meant for sharing looked impressive!  All in all, we had a nice time celebrating our friends birthday over dinner. However, I was a little disappointed in Charcut and I don't think I'd return. Despite all of the glowing reviews, the menu just didn't win me over and the price was really high given the quality and amount of food. I love the \"family style\" sharing concept, but you can do that elsewhere without having to spend $90 on a steak. I'm in the minority here but I rate our experience just \"A-Ok\"."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I love coming here for lunch and selecting one of their lunch menu options, especially because their lunch menu comes with a bag of warm cookies to go!   The main lunch option we get comes with soup, sandwich of the day, Parmesan fries, pickle and of course the cookies - it is so filling, tasty and the best vale for money."}
{"text":"Catch me dead if I come into this place again. We were greeted by a poorly groomed hostess with a black and grey plaid button up shirt and her fists tucked into her sleeve like a turtle from the thunder. We thought we were underdressed. When our server came by we were greeted with \"what you want drink?\"; I thought great! Let's keep this visit short, I don't want to know your name anyway! We witnessed another server that had cleared a table to which she dropped a dirty spoon and spilt some ketchup, I'm super amazed, she only took 25 minutes to pick up the spoon while she and other customers narrowly escaping the ketchup for another 8 minutes before being cleaned.  We sat on the balcony (inside, a step or so up to a higher platform.) And we were served from the other side the whole time. Not once did he take a simple step up and not help us from the other side of the fence. We saw him at the neighboring tables as well, hands in his pocket while taking orders, disrespectful! The oysters we ordered, $4 each, the size of a loonie was brought by the hostess; helpfully she was able to locate the lemon, the horse radish, the tomato mignonette with her index pointing at them less than an inch away. We were half way done the entree, and we noticed our server had zipped past us a couple of times. Finally able to check and see if our food was good, we received an \"everything good?\" Whilst walking backwards towards another table. I wanted to mention this to a manager but couldn't see one for the life of me, there were other waitresses that were better dressed but you could always point out a manager in restaurants like this. More than anything I wanted to get the hell out of this place. I don't even need to mention the food, bland is more than generous, but you can't get service like this anywhere else, you'll actually get better at Denny's! The food is a commodity when it comes to customer service, even if the food were good, can't say this place beats even McDonalds and it's because of JUST the service, beginning to end."}
{"text":"WOW loved the prime rib sandwich. It was amazingly delicious. Also portion was huge. Well I came with my colleague lunch and was told that they have lunch special here. Every day they have a sandwich special that came with soup, fries and cookies for $16. Today deal was pullpork sandwich but I didn't feel like pullpork. So I ended up ordering the prime rib sandwich.   Also this place has home made pickle and home made ketchup (my colleague said it was too sweet). The ketchup is a bit sweeter than normal but it was so good with fries.   D√©cor was nice. Service was friendly. Food came really quick. Also this place fills up really quick for lunch. I suggest you coming early say 11:30 to beat the rush.   Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Left with a disappointment.   I expected a great prime rib and potatoes.   I ordered Aurora Borealis drink and it was not that great.  But 16 bucks for that drink, outrageous.    Then I ordered 6-oz prime rib and load of potatoes with bacon.  I gave the good thumb on potatoes but prime rib, about 25 bucks for half fats?    Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was great, although choices are somewhat slim but the meat quality is superb and cooked to perfection. Went there for my husbands birthday with no reservation, they were still welcoming and sweet. Also they have great drinks on special and the dessert is to die for!!  P.s Defenately try the oysters"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, I present the finest charcuterie board in Calgary. This was a welcome treat for my taste buds that are dancing to the symphony that is playing live in my mouth right now. This is precisely what foodgasms feel like.  May you feast on the seven types of delicately spiced and carefully cut meats. The intricate flavors blossom well with the condiments which juxtaposition themselves artfully with the texture. My dance partner/ drink pairing is a beautiful, smooth cocktail involving Havana 7 year rum, antica formula, Amaro Montenegro, yellow chartreuse and the kicker with peychaud bitters.   Tonight's main course is a delectable, medium rare petite tenderloin cut with some Argentinean chimicurri house sauce and kitchen cucumbers coupled with some arugula. Friends are enjoying their luxurious prime rib and sausage burgers with cheese and fried egg.  Hand cut fries with truffle gravy, cheese curds and boar bacon served a very crucial sidekick role, kinda like the Dr. Watson to our amazing Sherlock meal.  As evinced by this elaborate post, great food and drinks are a quintessential part of my life. I live to experience these epicurean moments."}
{"text":"Really well done.  Bobo and I went for our Anniversary.  Had a reservation for Friday night. We saw the chef on coming in (which was a bonus as we were fans of hers from Top Chef Canada) and she smiled and said hello, even though it was clear she was busy. I love that, it shows she values her customers and in my opinion deserves success.  We were seated promptly an our waitress was helpful and friendly. The meals are served family style which was great since we did not have to steal bites off each other's plates.  Beet salad, Poutine, quarter Chicken and butcher's cut Bison.  When it arrived we weren't sure we had ordered enough but it was the perfect amount for the two of us. we had a chimmichurri Revelation and were pleased with all our choices.  We thankfully had room for dessert. Maple Panna cotta (two layers of light flavourful yumminess and raspberry cheesecake.  These cheesecake could have been bigger, but that may just be gluttony on my part.  Fantastic world class meal, right in our own backyard.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Charcut.  I can understand why not everyone would like it, but if you're looking for an innovative take on pork, then this place is amazing.  They butcher in house, ingredients are top notch and the recipes are inspired.  It's not comfort food, and it's not so cheap you'd eat there every day, but it's not so expensive that you'll regret going there for a evening out."}
{"text":"Husband and i ate there the other night and we were a bit disappointed considering the reviews. Our waiter seemed very busy although there were more empty tables than taken ones. Each time he came by the table we said we were ready, ready for drinks, ready to order, ready for desserts etc. and each time he said \"I'll give you a minute\" then would literally rush off. After a couple times all could do was laugh, because we were obviously being ignored and brushed off. We had to ask three times to order dessert. When the food came, the portions were extremely small for the price. Not extremely impressed with the quality of the food. Dessert size looked like a sample portion and was over cooked, for $12 it was the perfect end to a disappointing night."}
{"text":"I always find that the issue with reviewing highly rated restaurants is that they already have some pretty amazing publicity.  But I'll review Charcut anyways.  We came here for lunch and it was amazing.  I must admit that it ranks pretty high in terms of business lunches.  45 mins, in and out.    The $15 menu is a steal.  Comes with soup, entree and some pretty orgasmic cookies.  I ordered the 7 oz steak this time around.  Very tender and juicy.  Only complaint is that the steak was pre-cut so I didn't get to relish in the pleasure of cutting my own steak.  It's okay Charcut, I'll let it slide this time around.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the staff and managment, we cancelled an order prior to even having it served, the staff made a big deal about it when it showed up on our bill. She ended up calling over management whom was just as / if not more rude and unprofessional. When eating a upper class restaurant i expect professionalism. clearly there is nothing here but overprices and unprofessional wannabes. Ps we had a party of 20.  DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"I will admit before visiting Charcut I was nervous...  My dad picked this restaurant for his birthday dinner, and as a vegetarian Charcut \"Roasthouse\" didn't entirely appeal to me.  This was the best meal I've ever had from start to finish at a restaurant to date.  Starters: Brussel sprouts: fried in duck fat, seasoned with lemon and chili... I have no words, just order this.  Duck fat fries: so crispy, so soft and fluffy in the middle, the homemade \"ketchup jam\" is sweet and savoury, this is a must order.  Melted cheese & bread: mini brioche buns with melted cheese, creamy and savoury.  Arugula salad: arugula and mixed greens with a tangy acidic dressing, creamy white bean hummus and spicy peppers. So refreshing, something I will definitely be craving.  Dessert: salted caramel pudding, not something I thought I would enjoy but judging by it being gone within 30 seconds I'd say it's pretty good. Reminded me of salted caramel creme br√ªl√©e.  Overall had an amazing experience here. Prices are high but I feel for the quality of service, execution, plating and seasoning it's 100% worth it.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My experience here was less than acceptable. I would not eat here again. I would only recommend this place to people I hate.   All this hype brought me here and as glossy as the venue is, that's all you will get. Gloss. Our broccolini was grilled to a crisp but drizzled in oil to look glossy. It was inedible.  If you look at my pictures you'll see why.  We had reservations a week in advance as this was a big occasion for the family. We were seated away from the dining room, near the busy and loud bar in the front.  We ordered 2 a bottle of wine, it was served with an air of \"we don't give a damn.\"  Our Bone Marrow au Gratin was ok at best. It had 4 bites. Tuna spread was plain horrid, bland, and tiny. $29 for 6 bite size peices of lamb?  Fish was a travesty, it was grilled dry through and through. The 27 ounce steak the birthday boy ordered was ok at best. Poutine was about the only thing that was good, but wasn't enough to share between 2 people because it was THAT small. Chicken? Swiss chalet could have done better.  Just when I thought dessert would save the day...... both items came out like it was tossed on a plate out of a box. Just look at the picture.   All the server could do was make frowny faces after seeing how dry and inedible everything was.  That was the most expensive meal I have ever paid to eat complete rubbish."}
{"text":"I was fortunate the server was really knowledgeable with her craft and restaurant food. Otherwise I would of ordered everything wrong. The char cut board was worth the expense.  Poutine seem to be on every menu in Calgary."}
{"text":"Don't be scared off of Charcut if you think they only have charcuterie - they do not (though they certainly do that as well). They also offer sandwiches, including some most excellent lunch specials, where they promise to get you out of the door in a speedy 45 minutes - great for the business crowd - and some very tasty soups. Those specials include sandwiches, with (naturally) meat as the stars and end with bags of some of the best cookies ever. You can eat them there or save them for later.  When it comes to the meats, however, definitely don't skip them as they are made in-house, and it is also well worth trying, served in heaping piles, along with some very tasty breads. It may not be what many are used to from a charcuterie, being served on a platter rather than a board, but that doesn't appear to affect the taste and it was possible to pile even more on the plate. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"First time dining at Charcut, and I must say I had expected that it was pretty upscale. Surprisingly, it wasn't, which isn't a bad thing. I'm not a fan of places that are unnecessarily pretentious for no reason. Charcut seems to focus on good food without the pretend fanciness.  We got the bison brisket and lamb sirloin with sides of charcut potatoes and duck fat brussels sprouts. The entrees were great, the bison was insanely tender, and the mint gremolata was an excellent pairing with the lamb. The brussels sprouts were also excellent, however we found there to be too much bacon on the potatoes.   The only thing about the meal was that everything seemed to be incredibly salty. Could be my own fault for never salting anything, but with the bacon it was a bit overkill. It didn't ruin the food, however, it could have done with being a little less salty.   Overall a good experience, looking forward to going back and trying something different next time."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, there was this hot new ticket in town. Charcut. My first visit was in December of 2010. Then in January of 2011, there was this explosion of something called an Alley Burger. We lined up by Charcut's back kitchen door for $5 burgers. The beginnings of true \"gourmet street food.\" Quite literally. After Alley Burger came Chef Connie's appearance on Top Chef Canada last year, and my share of Mondays at Charcut watching the TV and then watching the rest of the crowd as they'd swivel their necks towards the open kitchen and crane to see what Connie's reaction was in person whenever something happened regarding her on the show.   And now, well, Charcut is just awesome food, plain and simple. The must tries, in this order: any of the desserts in a jar, Charcut board (make sure the mortadella's on there), poutine, heirloom beets, raclette, bone marrow, asparagus salad honey something carrots. I'm sure I'd tell you to eat the entrees too if I'd gotten that far... but I haven't yet. Too many things to keep sharing with my friends. That time will come though, I'm sure.  Nuff said? I don't think so. Two cocktails you've got to go try are the clarified caesar (please make sure you eat the bacon that comes in the drink) and the dark and stormy.   It's one thing to hear and to read that Charcut is one of the top restaurants in the city. It's quite another to have experienced it first hand and put your own name behind that kind of statement. But Connie and John have created such a great place! And I can take/suggest it to just about anyone... hanging out with friends, out on a date, family's in town and they need a good place to eat... and to top it all off, everyone's just so gosh-darned NICE!   The next time I'm wearing a hat, I shall stop in for a hats off salute, Connie and John!"}
{"text":"First off all if you are like me and not to crazy about smoke taste to the max. Move on. I had the 10 oz prime rib and the truffle poutine. The prime rib was over cook.  Then the rub they put on it is over whelming then to kill the beef the smoke taste is just wow. Cant taste the meat at all. I felt like I was licking an ashtray. The poutine was very good but it was cold. I felt like it died on the pass.  It it would have been hot it would have been great. Hope the had home made fries and not the frozen types.  Over all was a 85$ i lost and never will get back. Just saying"}
{"text":"I'm giving Charcut 3.5* but I honestly I only tried a small selection of their menu (and not even what they're famous for!?! - explanation below). I would love to go back and try other items and review again (such as their burger, poutine, charcuterie board, another entree, and dessert)...*sigh* If only I were paid to eat!!!   heheh (^_^).    What I DID eat didn't wow me, but it was still tasty and enjoyable.  Parking is awful but they do offer valet (unsure of the cost).  Also, needed was a 5+ day advanced reservation for a 7pm weekend slot?!?! WOW! Calgary is so crazy now!  We couldn't get the coveted 7pm reservation so we went earlier and got a table!!! yayyy!  You can share tapas style or order separate entrees (up to you). We decided on tapas style.  What I found out also upon getting the menu is that the chef was on 'Top Chef' Canada.  So naturally I also wanted to try her 'top chef' selections which she made on the show, but my guest had a few food restrictions which limited us on the menu...  What we did try was:  1) panzanella salad - meh... just large croutons dressed and some veggies - won't order that again 2) Arugula Tuna Conserva - the presentation was nice with tuna (cooked in lemon juice) placed in a jar and topped with a marinated/cooked (?)  slice of lemon, served with a side of croustini -  I would order this again. 3) braised short rib/beef - good but nothing special, it had a hint of bbq sauce flavor which I personally did not like but was still good non the less. 4) pork croquette w onion rings - pork inside the croquette reminded me of corned beef (which I didn't like).  It wasn't the lightest crispiest croquette I've ever had but it was still good, the onion rings were made well and were tasty... and I can see why people like the whole dish in general.  5) side of broccolini - what can I say about that? it was charred/grilled broccolini.  As for atmosphere, this is a nice place for a first date (IMO)... Not as upscale as you might imagine... just trendy and casual..... like a lounge with better food...not what i define as a 'fine dining' establishment.  Do you dress up for these kinds of places?... you CAN but you don't have to. I wouldn't be wearing a schlumpy t-shirt with your weekend painting pants, but a suit and tie are not necessary nor does it really fit in the atmosphere....   As for service, the wait staff were nice and accommodating but we could have been checked up on more often rather than having us find and wave down a server."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special which consists of a soup, sandwich, parmesan fries, and takeout cookie for $15.  The fries and cookie are amazing but the sandwich is decent but not great. Soup is tasty depending upon the daily pick.  Overall the ambience is noisy at lunch time as it's fairly busy. I'd recommend reservations!  Not many stars as service is good but not great. A solid place for lunch.,"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is simple and absolutely delicious. I work in the area and the 45 min in and out lunch is a \"go-to\" for my employees and myself. Great deal for a $15 lunch from a really nice place. I've been for dinner and the atmosphere is good for date night or to hang out with friends. Charcut is a must!"}
{"text":"Sweet jezebel, I'm drowning in an ocean of meat and I don't want to swim to the surface.  Forget the naysayers, reader. If you're like me and the very thought of consuming an animal causes your mouth to water and your adrenaline to spike for the hunt, Charcut is a must-visit. There are so many animals for you to put in your mouth you won't even know where to begin.  I went here with my roommate for his birthday. His family was picking up the tab (hint: it's not a cheap place, so don' go in expecting Junior Bacon Cheeseburger prices or you be in for the biggest sticker shock of your life) so I wasn't too worried about being selective. We tried one of... well, pretty much everything on the menu.  The setup here is sharing. You share your dishes and everyone talks about how delicious things are while you shove them in your mouths like a great big happy family of wolves that stumbled across a perfectly seasoned carcass in the middle of the forest.  Two words for you, Yelp: DUCK. POUTINE. This is the reason God invented ducks. I've never wanted a dish to last for eternity more than I did when I tasted this poutine.   But then, out came the Chef's Cut Steak. I have no idea what was on this, all I know is that if I don't ever eat it again I'll consider my life a wasted endeavor. On my headstone, I'll want them to carve: \"Joel - Didn't eat Chef's Cut twice. FAILURE.\"  And there was a massive platter of different meats, from a head meat to a sausage to a bunch of other things I can't even recall because I was tripping so much balls on animal flesh that my taste buds were having seizures.   Somewhere in the orgy of flavors there was a chicken. Of all the dishes this was probably my least favorite and I'd still eat 8 of them before ever touching a piece of Swiss Chalet again.   Then dessert. Their bacon apple pie? Yeah, not a favorite. But that can be forgiven because there was some sort of tiramisu or crumbly pudding thing in a cup that I would easily run down a man in my car for.   In conclusion: I am now drooling all over my keyboard, so I'm going to call it a day there. If you've got some cash to flash and you love stuffing your face with dead things, Charcut. End of story."}
{"text":"My gf and I decided to plan a full Saturday together as it was long overdue.  We were messaging each other back and forth; she was googling while I was yelping restaurants.  We came up with a top 3: Charcut, Notable, & Rush.  After a long debate of drooling over all the menus, we decided to go with Charcut because it's the most reviewed restaurant on Yelp and we've never been.  We both looked at open table reservations and the only reservation times open were 5PM and 9PM.  We thought about it as we planned to shop all day at Cross Iron Mills and came to a consensus that 5PM would be best.  We shopped til about 3PM and went back to my place to get ready.  We left at about 4:30PM to ensure we were there on time for our reservations.  On the drive to Charcut:  Me: OMG can't wait for dinner, so excited!! Anna: Yeah, me too! This will be sooo good! Me: The resos are under your name right? Anna: I don't know, I thought it would be under yours.... Me: I thought you made reservations!?! Anna: I thought YOU did!! Me: -_- Anna: -_- Me: Sooooo.....we don't actually have reservations for 5?  So pretty much Anna and I had a major miscommunication but we still decided to test our luck at Charcut.  We parked a block or so away and walked in the freezing cold in our short dresses and heels.  We were immediately greeted and asked for a table for 2.  They were full till 10PM!! Luckily the bar had seats.  We took at seat right at the bar and were the only couple there.  The bar tenders were quite entertaining, making jokes and chatting it up.  I ordered a ginger gimlet for a drink and Anna went with water.  If you like ginger...this is the drink for you, it was a nice fresh citrus flavor with an overpowering ginger taste... fresh ginger juice, gin, and lime cordial topped with candied ginger, lime peels! Deliciously tasty!  Anna and I both went with an 8 oz. prime rib (you can only order minimum of 8 oz - $4.5 per oz), we both ordered med-rare but asked for more rare.  And of course we ordered the famous duck fat poutine to share for a side.   While waiting, I eyed up the dining room.  It seemed pretty intimate with the dimmed lights; somewhere you would bring a loved one for an anniversary.  I enjoyed the open concept kitchen where we can see the chefs in action!  It didn't take long for our meals to come; the presentation of the prime rib was okay.  There was a small portion of arugula on top of the rib, sauce, horseradish and salt on the side.  There was also roasted garlic half and a slice of lemon.  Our meat was cooked as requested and I enjoyed the tenderness of the rib, it was good but I didn't think it was worth the $$$ I paid.  Anna and I both found although the prime rib was tasty, it was really fatty.  The horseradish was perfect as it wasn't overly powering like wasabi but just enough to get a little kick.  We both thought the duck fat poutine was great!  The fries were nicely seasoned with a little crisp to each bite, the cheese curds were visibly melted and it was covered in delicious truffle gravy.  I ate the majority...I probably could have gone for another but I decided to squeeze room for dessert.  Anna ordered the milk chocolate parfait and I went with the 'featured' dessert..... STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING.  I think my eye balls popped out when I saw this, you don't know how much I love STP.  I was overly excited.  They don't always have the sticky toffee pudding though, they told me that they change the dessert menu every 2 months or so to match the 'theme' of the month, he said Christmas is coming so they put STP on the menu.    Our desserts arrived and of course being the foodie I am... I salivate while trying to take good pictures before we put a dent in them.  Anna's chocolate parfait was layered with sea salt caramel, topped with a nice ovaltine crunch and dark chocolate.  It was tasty but nothing compared to mine!!  My sticky toffee pudding was a nice moist date cake, topped with a generous amount of bourbon toffee sauce with a scoop of pumpkin ice cream sprinkled with cayenne pumpkin seed powder.  It was seriously AMAZING; I was in heaven after the first bite and polished my plate off.  I really wanted to lick my plate but I didn't want to look like a savage.   Overall, the meal was ok, the dessert was phenomenal and the bartenders were very fun and interpersonal.  I think I would have enjoyed my visit more if I were sitting in the dining area but that's our own fault!  The bar is open and anyone can sit beside you so it's not as intimate and private but it's fun!  Oh, the stools are quite heavy to move (thankfully I work out ;))  Next time, I'll MAKE RESOS and have the full on dining experience...or even come for lunch!! :)  Also, when possible....order the sticky toffee pudding.....it will change your life for the night. MMMMMMMMMM!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was conveniently located next to our hotel lobby at Le Germain. I had a basic salad that came with plenty of shredded cheese and lots of bacon bits that had a hint of caesar dressing. It was really good. For the entree, I had a butcher steak medium-well which was cooked perfectly. It came with arugala and chopped carrots which complimented the steak. The side was garlic potatoes with sour cream and strips of bacon on top. Who doesn't love more bacon?! The dessert was salted caramel with chocolate crunch. Great taste but small portion. Service was great overall and price matched the experience."}
{"text":"This place delivered the goods in an oh so pleasant way. The service was superb, the attention to detail was something to behold,the setting was awesome! really, really nice!   Always so refreshing to eat at a restaurant that celebrates high quality ingredients! the fact that most of it is locally sourced is pretty cool to! Bottom line is, it tasted really good, lived up to the all the buzz! They certainly got themselves a new customer!  man I really love it when a place lives up to the hype!   Pork is the name of the game at Charcut, it is a celebration of the pig! You can see pigs heads in the open kitchen behind the chefs,.Little pig paper clips on the bills? i mean c'mon!!! are these people related to me or something?? we are kindred spriits thats for sure!  They know where its at!!  We started with the pretzels, it was a nice chewy yet soft texture, it was  just a very high quality and fresh pretzel served with whole grain mustard!,  we also got some terrine, mmm mmm, tasted just like it should have!!! pork, no bull in this mix, just pork and more pork. A side of some homemade pickles, superb!  Of course we got the share burger( had to it was my first time) very tasty and unique burger. We could have waited in line outside for some alley burgers (virtually the same thing but no brioche bun and only 5 bucks!!! WOAH thats a deal!) but it was just too bloody cold tonight! I wanted to enjoy my burger in a proper nice setting! and oh boy did I ever enjoy it! and the poutine??  really exellent!  fried in duck fat and some really good cheese with truffle gravy! Just out of the park home run style!, a dish that strummed my heartstrings!   I was tempted to get all pork items possible! ( the salumi, the mortadella) and just load up my ol visa, but I decided that i would restrain myself THIS time. So I got some brocollini instead (to offset a possible heart attack) and a very nice dessert! this brownie thing with perfect ice cream and some delicious crumbly stuff! only wish the dessert was twice as big! hahahaha, the brocollini was dead simple and perfect! just bang on!  Gosh I gotta come back here soon! I am sure this will be an on going review!  Yes its kinda pricey compared to your average joint, but its good, REAL good!! no pretending here let me tell you!  the old saying \"you get what you pay for\" certainly applies, at least for me! I had no problem parting with my hard earned cash, because they delivered pure quality!.   This place may not be for everyone, but those who appreciate the wonders of a pig and local fresh ingredients, prepared in a simple and rustic fashion, 99.8% sure you will enjoy the Charcut experience.   If I were a pig I would donate myself to Charcut! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dandelion salad with grilled sourdough and white bean hummus. Great craft cocktails. Love the ones that play with bourbon or gin!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal here, and wish I could have gone back more times to sample some of their other dishes.  The Charcuterie chef's sampler was excellent, and our steaks were cooked perfectly.  Only negative was that I am not a big fan of the fried potato sticks on top of the steaks."}
{"text":"After moving to Calgary 5 years ago, I kept hearing about Charcut. It's like the TV show that people keep talking about but you've never had time to watch it. Today, I've finally decided to see what all the fuss is about.  Environment - We went on a Saturday evening and I've gotta tell you, finding parking in downtown was like finding Nemo: long, drawn out, but you find Nemo in the end 10 blocks away from Charcut. The restaurant was full and atmosphere robust. But to be honest, after taking 20 minutes to find parking, all I wanted was some food in my belly.  Food - The lamb sirloin, rotisserie chicken, and bison brisket were cooked well. Taste was great but nothing particularly unique to write home about. I thought the taste was one dimensional. Maybe it was because they didn't come with any sides that complimented the main flavor. My friend ordered the Charcut sausage burger and although I didn't try it, she said it was quite dry. The best part of the meal was actually the poutine, which I thought was quite flavorful. If I am to go back to Charcut, I would order the poutine for the appetizer, entree, and dessert.  Value - I think Charcut is a good restaurant serving good food. However, the price I paid for the food just doesn't reflect the taste I was expecting and striving for. I wanted a symphony of different flavors coming together to form a masterpiece instead of being placated with a mildly tantalizing single note.  Overall - service and atmosphere was great, but I expected more from all the talk. Unfortunately, I feel Charcut just could not walk the walk."}
{"text":"Ordered steak, bison steak, and tomato salad with fresh basil. The steak was reasonably priced and well prepared, but the bison steak lacked flavour while not even having the bison meat texture (it was similar to cheap, tough cut cooked so long only to make it appear tender). For ~$70, you can do a lot better than this place in terms of food (very nice environment though). BTW, did I mention that they don't even serve you any bread? You just get to look around till you meal is ready and if you ordered steak, you just get meat.."}
{"text":"I've spent the last year in Calgary and this is pretty much my favorite restaurant.  Everything they do is relatively simple, but everything they do they do really well.    Standout dishes include the pighead mortadella, their daily cut of steak, Hotchkiss Tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella, prime rib, Duck fat fried poutine, and Preserved Huckleberries in a jar ( Local huckleberries layered with cheese cake and graham crackers)   Great service, good ambiance, good wine/beer selection.  Grab a seat at the chefs bar to watch the kitchen in action."}
{"text":"Charcut would deserve 5 stars if they changed a few things.  I strongly dislike the 18% gratuity policy for larger parties.  Our group was dinged with this for our first dinner experience here and for a restaurant so successful, it feels a little greedy to me.  My spouse made the reservation for us and had to provide his credit card number.  He was informed that if we cancelled less than 24hrs prior to our reservation, he'd be charged $35/person.  Again, this seems greedy.  What if someone had died?  Would we have to show a death certificate in hopes of having the charge waived?  Ridiculous.  Lastly, our group of 8 was seated at a very large table.  It was so large that from one end to the other, there was probably a span of 8 feet or more and what our friends at the other end of the table had to say was basically inaudible because of the restaurant noise.  This robbed us of some of the fun of dining together.  Other restaurants have cozier seating which is much better.    Aside from these things, the food is fantastic.  The House baked Soft Pretzels are like bread sticks and even though they are great, one is not worth $8.  I think I had best Poutine ever and would order that again in a heartbeat.  I also really enjoyed the Smashed Poplar Bluff potatoes.  My spouse thought they were just okay.  We shared a half Heritage Chicken which is a lot of meat and quite good.  My spouse ordered the Butcher Steak and didn't enjoy it as much as the chicken because he didn't like the spices on it.    Truly, if you have the money to spend and want a nice dinner out, Charcut is a great place to go.  However, I'd keep my party number down to four or less."}
{"text":"It's always a good thing when your sales exec treats you and your team to dinner.  This certainly was no exception.  The food and service were great.  We shared small plates of roasted beets w/ goat cheese and the bone marrow.  All very tasty.  For an entree, I enjoyed the prime rib and my co-workers had the slow roasted leg of lamb.  We shared sides of the poutin, roasted potatoes, broccolini, and gnocchi.  Nothing disappointed.  All the ingredients were fresh and perfectly prepared.  We also split an array of desserts with a Saskatoon berry cheescake, creme brulee, s'mores cake, and mini rocky road ice cream cones.  Again, all deliciously prepared -- my fave was the s'mores cake.  After dinner, one of the chefs stopped by and chatted with us about the restaurant.  Apparently they spent some years in the SF Bay Area and worked with Alice Waters.  Seems like it was a good influence.  Hope to come back sometime to see what other fresh items they have on their daily-changing menu."}
{"text":"Went to Charcut at around 9:40pm a couple of Mondays back. Like most things in YYC downtown and after 730pm, it was dead.   Menu was to be expected, wine menu was alright. 3 oz glasses of wine were short 3/4's of an ounce - disappointing.   Food ordered was this pretzel thing, a chicken salad and something else - entirely non-memorable however, I do not eat meat so I didn't try the meat stuff.   Staff was aloof or slow....not sure. Guy at the front door was friendly.   For the price, it's a \"great white hype\". Beautiful hotel tho.   Coming as a newbie from Vancouver, this doesn't hold a candle to anything in our downtown area of that calibre."}
{"text":"I've been going to Charcut since day one. I tend to go overboard when I eat at Charcut. Pound back a poutine followed by a pile of their signature Pig Head Mortadella (literally a mortadella cooked inside a pig's head!) and followed up with a pint and one of their awesome desserts (usually the cheesecake in a jar). They also have some lighter options like grilled fish and bright fresh hearty salads. I like watching the chickens take a spin over the grill. The vibe in the room covers a lot of bases. It's casual but classy, jeans or suits. Most importantly the food is really frigging delicious."}
{"text":"I swear this is the best prime rib I ever had in my life. I chose 8 Oz as you can select how big you want I could've gone 10 but that's fine. It's a smoked prime rib with a special sauce will be visiting again next time I'm in town and want to take friends or family to a good place!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try Charcut for quite a while now and finally got my fix! I loved everything and it would be hard to say what my favorite was. My boyfriend and I decided to order family style, that way we could get a little taste of everything.   We visited on a Sunday and were actually surprised that it was so busy! I love places that have a good vibe 7 days a week. We had the much raved about duck fat poutine, which was awesome!! The cheese curds were unbelievable! Along with the bone marrow, delicious but not good for people that are sensitive to texture....cheese that was paired perfectly with jam. Mmm just writing this makes me want to go back immediately.   Btw! Make a reso, otherwise you could be in for a wait!"}
{"text":"I've been in Calgary only a day and I've had 2 experiences with Charcut so far.   The first was room service only (I am staying at the hotel located about the restaurant). When I arrived Calgary late night I was starving. I ordered a Slow Roasted Beets and Goats Cheese salad, along with a Dry Aged Butcher Steak  w/ fries.   The food arrived my room about 20 minutes later and I was not disappointed - the reviews are correct, the food here is absolutely excellent. The chef comped me a free small sampler of charcuterie which was a nice touch. The steak was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth-nicest-I-have-ever-tasted. The beet & goat cheese salad was also nice.  Today I popped by Charcut for drinks only and had a nice in-house experience as well. Excellent service, cozy and unpretentious interior.  It's not a cheap place but definitely worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 Ok I know I'm a vegetarian but i LOVE steakhouses! 2 reasons - great salads and sides AND my meat-eating bf reviews most of it for me :P  My bf and I met another couple here for a double date. We were seated at a table for 4 near the bar. It was kind of tight but we were super excited so it didn't really matter. My bf loves the Le Germain style and was waiting to go eat here for a while.   We ordered a lot! To split for the table we ordered the slow roasted heirloom beets $9 (which myself and my gf ate most of b/c they were so GOOD!), 2 orders of the duck fat fried poutine (ok the 3 of them split the 2 orders of this and they could have def had another one, they all LOVEDDDDDDDD this poutine - def something you MUST order!). They also ordered something else under the charcut boards which they really enjoyed too but I can't remember it grrr!  My gf fiancee ordered the prime rib which is $4.50/oz starting @ 8oz, he said it was really good and I think my bf regreted not getting that. He ordered another steak but it was quite small and he was still hungry.   I got the watermelon and cucumber salad $12 which was good, not the best salad I've hard, kind of small but with the beets and sides I was good :)  Overall def a GREAT restaurant, with a lovely atmosphere, can't wait to stay at this hotel in January (already made res for mid-Jan) and eat here again :)"}
{"text":"Simply the best. This is as good as it gets in Calgary. You can add this review to the legion of other reviewers who share that opinion."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Melted Cheese and Bread with Raclette, Housemade Butter Rolls 5oz Charcut Sausage Share Burger with Cheese Curds, Fried Egg, Beer Battered Onion Rings and Bone Marrow Poutine with Truffle Gravy, Cheese Curds Roasted Heirlooom Carrots with Yogurt, Dill Feta Cheese Salted Caramel and Milk Chocolate Pudding Crunch Warm Sticky Toffee Pudding with Bourbon Gelato  Driving back to Calgary from Edmonton it was with mixed feelings that I looked at my upcoming meal at Charcut Roast House, the restaurant considered Calgary's best Steakhouse surely a nice place for dinner under most circumstances, but considering the last several days of great dining and a hometown where Steakhouses reign supreme a bit of a risk in terms of its ability to impress.  Booked several weeks in advance, the Flames versus Oilers Hockey Night In Canada Matchup well known to be the sort of event packing the restaurant full, it was at 5:55pm that I arrived for a 6pm seating, a tight table barely big enough for two-plates suggested as adequate with cold air from the doors wafting in occasionally and the loud hostess station providing a lot of noise, much to my chagrin.  Understanding the need to maximize capacity, though better two-tops are found throughout the restaurant including an elevated area with a good view of the kitchen, it was with menu in hand and Cocktails declined that I waited, and waited, for service - the young woman assigned to the section clearly stressed out by the pre-game rush while a tall, thin man wandered about with pursed lips and a look that could not have been interpreted in any way as indicative of pleasant guest service.  Not particularly blown away by the offerings, a lack of interesting cuts, Wild Game or Offal a bit different from what a perusal of old reviews suggests, it was after a bit of contemplation that an appetizer, two sides and an entr√©e were ordered, the former heard inappropriately and served after a lengthy delay by the tall man who visibly got more frustrated after he was informed of the error, storming away without a word and leaving me sitting again with nothing but water.  At this point half-debating walking out, the young woman returning with an apology and a pot of melted Cheese that would be stricken from the bill, the combination of Raclette and Parker House Rolls proved every bit as rich those familiar would expect from so much Milk Fat, the dish definitely something best to be shared and ideally alongside something to refresh the palate between bites, such as a Salad.   Told that Charcut's house-blend Burger is something of a signature, the \"Share Burger\" sold by the ounce made of spicy Ground Pork on a robust Bun with stretchy Cheese Curds and an Egg, sides are added a la carte and offered Family-style, the thick-cut Onion Rings tossed with nuggets of Liquid Marrow definitely the most interesting choice while the Poutine and Carrots were both fine, though the majority of the Fries were limp.  Focused on a few signatures for dessert, a jarred Cheesecake the least intriguing of three choices, it was with rapidity that two selections arrived just as the restaurant began to clear-out for gametime, the Salted Caramel and Milk Chocolate Pudding Crunch essentially a Pot de Cr√®me topped in Cocoa Pebbles Cereal while the Sticky Toffee Pudding arrived with Gelato already half-melted, the Booze doing a nice job of balancing the sweetness though the addition of raw Oats remains puzzling."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorites in town, easily in my personal TOP 10 restos.  A popular place made famous of gourmet pork burgers in dark alleyways, celebrity sitings, a Top Chef Canada finalist and an absolutely sinful Duck Fat Poutine in Truffle Gravy, this resto keeps outdoing itself under the masterful touch of Chef Connie DeSouza.    I had finally tried it as a surprise for my birthday.  I had been wanting to try it for the longest time, but just hadn't found an opportunity.... until I suddenly found myself there.  To start with the duck fat fried poutine in the absolutely divine truffle sauce was something to behold.  The subtle earthy notes in the sauce more than accentuated the fries, it's flavour enhanced by the wild flavour of the duck fat.  Literally oozing with flavour, I had dreams of another masterful chefs Foie Gras Poutine of Chef Martin Picard in Montreal.  Rich... sooo rich and something for the bucket list for everyone.  Next, I tried a wonderful cut of pork belly while my companion had a brilliant grilled wild trout and tuna dish served in a jar.  She still remembers the lemon notes int he flavour, while I simply recall my face matching Homer Simpson's face when confronted by a donut shop.  It just was so much and so rich... and I just had to stop before dinner.  I still want to try the bone marrow appetizer I keep hearing about, and the little pig shaped clip to a Top Chef postcard was a cute souvenir touch."}
{"text":"I've been to Charcut several times now. It is definitely a favorite of mine in Calgary. I haven't had a bad meal yet, although I was extremely disappointed with the bread and melted cheese that my sister ordered during my last visit. I would not recommend that to anyone. Besides that, everything I've had at this restaurant has ranged from very good to fantastic. The Charcut board and poutine are musts for the table. Besides that just take your pick of anything and you shouldn't go wrong."}
{"text":"Not sure I would go back. The servers were very focused on making us aware that in two hours, there was another reservation for our table. I did not pay too much attention because there were plenty of other tables - near the window like ours, and there was several  (patio and inside) empty tables. It was a decent meal, even though the server forgot to bring us one of the sides that she really pushed on us. No apologies for that omission and thank goodness it was not part of the bill. I was looking forward to experiencing the place and catching up with good friends. Next time, we'll find a more accommodating place that isn't anxious to ditch hotel guests who were keen to hang out. Oh well."}
{"text":"Came back here a second time with a friend, was not impressed unlike my first dining experience there. The food was definitely not all that great. I ordered more or less the same because I loved the dishes I had the first time, plus a few new ones and it all just seemed...not memorable, didn't get me excited, my taste palate was not exploding, rather I was downing my beer faster to get rid of the saltiness of my dish, which I can't remember what I had because like I said...not a memorable experience. I'll give it a go again, but I'll definitely be checking out other places first before going back a third time."}
{"text":"It had been a few years since I've been to CHARCUT but I was soon reminded at how amazing this place is.  The menu had changed somewhat, however there were still a couple of staple items still there.  We had reservations but the place was pretty empty on a Sunday at 5:30pm.  We were seated and our server was quite friendly and always smiling.  She was able to suggest some drink pairings which was fantastic.  We had the PEI oysters to start which tasted amazing.  They weren't terribly big but for what they lacked in size they made up for it (and then some) in flavour.  I mentioned I really like my oysters spicy so our server brought us some tabasco on the side.  She didn't have to do that, but it showed she cared enough.  My main course was the prime rib (9oz) and we shared sauteed mushrooms, cauliflower and the duck fat poutine.  I'd have to say, everything was good but the duck fat poutine was to die for.   For $9 the duck fat poutine is the best in the city in my opinion.  Skip the big cheese or pete's poutinery, spend a buck more and order real poutine at CHARCUT.  At around 8:00pm or so when we were finished our meal the restaurant had filled up.  Quite a testament to how great they are."}
{"text":"Excellent food service and atmosphere.  Portions were healthy and our server was knowledgeable.  Try to poutine and chimichiri steak!"}
{"text":"This place was legit, this was the first restaurant I tried out upon my visit to Calgary. I had the oysters and steak. The oysters were fresh otherwise nothing mind blowing.  The steak was well cooked with just the right amount of flavor and tenderness, not many words to describe this place but it was overall amazing. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!!.. Excellent appetizers, good wine, and delicious main courses!!... There was not one thing I didn't like!!.. Everything was excellent!!.. I would definitely go back there again soon!!.. One of my favorites restaurants in the area... Nothing to complain!..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when I'm in town. I'm not a steak connoisseur, but I love the steak with chimichurri and arugula. Their sticky toffee pudding with bourbon gelato is also divine. I usually hang out at the bar-- the bartenders are always welcoming and happy to offer suggestions."}
{"text":"First time coming here for their lunch menu. I ordered the daily sandwich, soup of the day, fries, and bag of warm cookies for $16. It's part of their Charcut Lunch All At Once menu. My partner ordered the pasta.   Everything was tasty, although I think I would have preferred a substitute for salad instead of the fries. There was too much fries for my liking, but their ketchup was made in-house, a unique taste.   The sandwich was tasty as well, the bread was seasoned well. It's cute how they provided 2 cookies in a paper bag for you to-go. They were delicious chocolate chip cookies - slightly oily though.   Overall, we had a great time here with a friend. Our waiter was personable and attentive. For an affordable lunch option with good quality food in a nice setting, I would likely come back again!"}
{"text":"Charcut offers a wide variety of meats presented in various ways. I love the concept of sharing food with your fellow table mates. The share option allows for a table to try various items in reasonable portions. The serving staff are always super helpful on deciding what to eat. I should mention that this restaurant is not a place to take your vegetarian friend, but for all meat lovers it is well worth a visit. Great place for a date night or to catch up with friends. I recommend the prime rib and the duck fat fried poutine as a side"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for a date, a serious gab fest with friends or merely catching up with clients for a lunch. Never been disappointed with the food, service and that drink menu? Wunderbar!!! We come to Charcut more often than our bank accounts would like, but it sure is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch deal for 15 bucks! The food is great and it's a nice place to go on your lunch break any day of the week. Service is good, but I feel like it could be better - the server was not too knowledgeable about the dishes, which is a little bit of a bummer considering the complex flavours in some of the dishes!"}
{"text":"Best \"dining alone\" experience I have ever had....and I have been traveling for 16 years.  I had the best seat in the house at the bar at the open kitchen.  The entire staff was welcoming, talkative and informative.  The food was amazing.  I was given a sample of poutine ( which I never cared for in past).  It was amazing. Steak was delicious, Brussels sprouts were awesome, carrots were amazing.  I want to thank all the staff for a wonderful experience!!!!"}
{"text":"A must for carnivores. Their dry ham is outstanding - so flavourful - it makes you realise just how much we are all ripped off by saline sodden ham products elsewhere. Ham as I remember it from my childhood.  And that was just the starter. A delightful meal, even at a busy time of year."}
{"text":"So they opened at 5PM, I got there at 5:40PM, this place was recommended by two people....I asked for a table for just myself, they seated me on the corner in main isle way. I couldn't sit on the one side because of the little wall, so I went to sit in the opposite seat and BAM!!! Slammed my knee into the bottom part of the little wall.  This is the table do you get when the restaurant is sold out or fully booked, you would literally take anything! But I arrived just 40 minutes after they opened the doors....surely a better table wouldn't have been a problem? I asked the server if they get a lot of complaints about this table. \"Sometimes\" was the reply from the back of her head.  Food: I had the $38 Bison. It was ok. It came out within 4 minutes of ordering. A little cold. There was NO way the chef made the bacon, mash potato and grilled the bison in that time. Let see what is in store in the next 24 hours for my stomach.  They are perfectly located across from the Calgary Tower so I imagine them to be busy but I would eat here again."}
{"text":"If I could, I would eat only at you, Charcut  Dear Restauranteurs, this is how you run a restaurant.    What are you waiting for, reader person??  Stop nerding it up in front of your computer and get on down to St. Germain Hotel for a feed you won't forget. Some colleagues and I decided on Charcut because none of us had gone but have only heard insanely good things.  I believe the chef was even a contestant  on Top Chef Canada and did well.  Too cool.    The hostess greeted us right away and took our jackets.  The restaurant is very well lit and there is modern artwork all over.  Immediately after being seated, our server greeted us and offered us still or sparkling water - love that.  He waited until all guests had arrived and offered us bevies.  The server, James F, is fantastic.  When my colleagues ordered Steam Whistle, James politely offered a similar beer (German) that he thought they might also enjoy.  And they did! That's awesome.  He was very knowledgeable of the menu, made great recommendations, and was very attentive without over crowding our lunch.  I have not had service this good in a while.  A guy I was with said the same thing and he and I used to be servers!  Our waters were always filled.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken salad with crumbled blue cheese.  Do you love wing nights?  Do you like salads?  This is a WING NIGHT IN A BOWL, PEOPLE.  Chunks of moist chicken tossed in a spicy buffalo sauce on romaine with chopped celery and sliced carrots.  I described it to someone after and they said \"Those are all my favourite things!\"  The others had the burger (which they're famous for - Alley Burger? Helllloooo), fish, and sandwich paired with arugula salad.  Everyone was very pleased.  For dessert, we ordered some cookies du jour for the table.  Warm, gooey, chewy chocolate chip.  I made the lunch a little awkward by not relenting on the cookie talk.  My only regret is not ordering a glass of milk.  Damn hind site milk strikes again.  So what are you waiting for, get your butt into Charcut!  Go! Now! Stop reading!  You're still here.  What did I just tell you. Get outta here.  Okay on the count of three and then you'll go. 1....2.. oh you're gone."}
{"text":"Excellent meats! You should try bison brisket and prime ribs. Grilled beans also one of my favorite."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent no matter what you get. Cocktails are nice as well. Service was average, nothing special. Classy social setting in the middle of downtown close to almost anything happening late night."}
{"text":"Fabulous place!! I have come here several times for their lunch special and it never disappoints! As it is located downtown, the lunch rush is 90% business/professionals working downtown. I do recommend making a reservation as it is a popular spot for those downtown. Also beware, parking sucks.   Their lunch deal is great as it's $15 for their daily sandwich, soup,  parmesan fries AND cookies to take home with you! Take that Subway! They also have their own homemade ketchup! Its definitely on the sweeter side and I would say it's more of a tomato \"jam\", but I think it's still good. If you're still a little hungry, you can order another sandwich or soup separately. I believe it's an extra $5 but for the total price, I think it's still a great deal.   The dinner menu is more family-style and everything is shared. My boyfriend and I had the prime rib w/ rosemary jus, the poutine and escarole salad. The prime rib came by the oz and I believe we got 10oz between the two of us. While it was enough, next time I will get the 12oz to share. Reason why? The prime rib was MELT in your MOUTH! Insanely tender and juicy and the rosemary ju just brought out the flavour even more. It also came with whole roasted garlic cloves, which I personally love (just make sure you have gum with you afterwards). We were told that the poutine was rated the best in the city, so we were excited to see what were going to try! I haven't tried many poutines in this city so there wouldn't be much competition, but what I can say is that I would return for the poutine. They give you a heathy portion and it is loaded with this amazing truffle gravy and cheese curds. The escarole salad was also very good, but it essentially tasted like a ceaser salad. Looking back it was a pretty heavy meal and the poutine was left unfinished. While there wasn't anything wrong with it, next time I will probably swap out the poutine for something not as heavy and rich. Recommend all 3 though dishes (just maybe separately)! Get the prime rib and thank me later.   The only downfall is the location if you don't work downtown, highly recommend it if you do!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Went for a birthday with 12 people and bottom line is the food was disgusting and over-priced. I am more than willing to pay $100 or more for a GOOD meal/drinks and do so fairly regularly, but will never go back to Charcut.   Firstly it took nearly 3 hours to get in and out due to poor service and the food took forever. We were there nearly 45 minutes before we even got appetizers. The meat platter appetizer was literally shaved deli meat in a pile for $15.  I got the melted cheese and bread (for $16) and received 4 tiny buns (slightly larger than a toonie),  and a 1-2oz portion of nasty cheese.  My buddy ordered the fish fillet and it came in the form of a whole fish... with all the bones and head (which he had to cut around to eat) .  This may be standard practice at some places but it was not what he was expecting, and he was NOT informed of it prior. There are probably 10 other things I could mention such as the duck fat poutine with the same nasty cheese and really soggy, greasy fries... but I don't want to write a novel.   The time we went they had severed pig heads sitting in the smoker window, staring at us as we ate...not MY idea of appetizing scenery but maybe if your name was Dexter you would like it?  Overall it was just a horrible experience and I found it to be very pretentious. Seems like the type of place yuppies will go pretending they're worldly and want to impress people with their \"refined pallet\"...but secretly also hate the food and only go because they like to waste money and show off. If you didn't get the hint... I would NOT recommend Charcut to anybody!!! Save your money and go to Vintage Chop house, Saltlik or even Milestones is 10x better if you want a nice casual dinner in less than 3 hours."}
{"text":"Don't know what the hype is all about.  To me, Charcut is meh.  I didn't particularly like what I ordered - Meatball Sandwich - the sauce that came with the sandwich was cold.  I was expecting meatballs but it was obviously a giant meatball and they had to slice up the meatball.  I got these 4 layers of meatball in a bun, slapped together with a sharp stick.  The only saving grace is the soup of the day which was Split Pea which was the hottest (temp wise) thing.  Nope, ain't coming back.  Ever."}
{"text":"It looked nice, but we left shortly after we sat down as it was extremely loud."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night by myself here. They were so accommodating. Usually if you are by yourself you get seated at a horrible table and forgotten about. I was seated at a nice, small table that had a view out the window and the waitress was there right away, very pleasant.  The food!!! I had the Riesling wine, so good ....and I don't usually drink wine. Then I had the fish selection with polenta and carrots. The polenta was creamy and garlicky, like good comfort food. The carrots were crisp and buttery. And the fish, the fish!!! Crisp, yet melt in your mouth. I had thought I was going to order dessert but since I cleared my plate, practically licked it clean, I had no room.   Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ehh......food was uninspiring...recommendation was that the roasted chicken was the star on the menu.  I had it, not impressed, okay but a bit dry.  Also had a beet salad (okay, would get if I went back), poutine (tasty), believe a braised bison over polenta (best dish I had), and a wood plate with an assortment of meat (chimichurri - gross, and prime rib - pretty good actually).  Staff was attentive and accommodating.  doubt I would return, if someone was picking up the bill I'd give it another try maybe..."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience at Charcut, whether it's a fancy dinner, get together with friends or a lunch date. It's a great place, with great food, great atmosphere and wonderful staff.   The last time we went, we went with a group of 7 for a bachlorette party. The waiter we had was absolutely wonderful! He helped recommend drinks, picked out our appies and main course and ensured that we had a good time. He also managed to pick out a meal that left us full for only 50$ per person. We also had a good variety in food, so everyone could try everything. Great experience! We also had one of the managers (I believe?) come and visit us at our table to congratulate our bride. It was overall a great experience.   Must tries are the tuna conserva. I believe this is the chef's dish she prepared while on Top Chef. For the record, there's no doubt in my mind why this dish was prepared for the show - it is amazing! Second favourite is the bison brisket. So rich and flavourful. Very tender and a good balance of acidity from the tomato and creamy from the polenta. Definitely a favourite main!   The only negative I can think of is that they no longer have their Hunter's Pie on their winter seasonal menu. That dish was amazing for a full meal during the winter time, but they said it took too long to prepare (took I think 40 minutes or more from ordering). Otherwise, always have had great food and experience at Charcut. Continues to be one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary people!!!! Gust night here came for a dinner at a well reviews place. Ended up picking this place. Wow the food was phenomenal. They actually make brussel sprouts taste amazing aside from the prime rib. A+++ people. U won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I came here during the Stampede late in the evening.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was still open and serving food at 11pm.  Our hostess looked so unbelievably bored it was quite off-putting.  The server was friendly, though her command of the menu was dismal at best.  When I asked about a particular menu item, the response was generally \"I like it.\" or \"I heard it's good.\" or \"It's pretty popular.\"  For the prices and reputation this restaurant commands, I would hope that they'd be able to go into description of the flavors etc.  We ordered three appetizers and a couple drinks.  The Pork Croquettes were so dry I couldn't finish more than two small meatballs.  The Kolbassa, was...well...just a sliced up weiner - nothing really special.  However, the escargot in the bone marrow was FANTASTIC; it was probably the only thing that kept me there for the entirety of our meal.  Wine selection by the glass was not very good, and was very very expensive.  The three different wines we had were all not great and about $14 for a small glass.  Thank goodness my apple juice ish cocktail was tasty.  I was unfortunately quite let down, considering the high praise from Enroute Magazine.  Perhaps I didn't order the right things...but you'd think that shouldn't matter if it's considered a top restaurant in the country."}
{"text":"Visited Charcut's \"Alley\" for my first Alley Burger. Obviously not as good as the Shareburger (no egg, no brioche), but hey ... tasty meat and curds on a kaiser bun for $5 ... who can complain?  The gas afterwards was deadly, however. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance. Good menu items.   Sat at the bar and had a nice dinner during my recent business trip. It would be better to go with a larger group so you can order a bunch and share things. Wanted to try their charcuterie board but obviously not good for one person.  Ordered the octopus appetizer to start with and had the chimichurri steak for the main. I'd give 3.5 stars for both.  Both proteins were a bit tough. Octopus is one of those things you need to treat with care so it doesn't become tough. Tenderizing octopus takes effort and Charcut didn't quite get it right. But the tomato chili oil sauce made up for it. I could've eaten that sauce all day, just as soup. The sauce was so on point the protein didn't even matter.   The steak was cooked perfectly to order (medium rare) but the meat was chewy. The flavor was good, the chimichurri sauce was good. The side arugula salad was a bid odd, but I didn't hate the pickle pieces thrown in there. Odd, but okay.   Probably 3.5 stars overall but rounding up."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch with my Aunt on a friend's recommendation and it was great! We both ordered the Alberta Prime Rib Sandwich and it was amazing! It came with a bowl of jus as well as a side of salad, parmesan fries or soup. I got the fries and yum! The lunch was huge and difficult to finish but we packed half the sandwich to go. Our server was super sweet and the whole huge meal was just $16 each plus tax and tip of course.... A STEAL considering everything is made fresh in house! My only complaint is that the food could have been a tad hotter. If you're downtown Calgary.... Come eat here! Added bonus... sparkling water is complimentary!  Oh! I can't believe I almost forgot.... They also sell their fresh desserts to go in adorable little cups!"}
{"text":"I probably will get slayed for this review, but I went to Charcut  for dinner and it was only OK.  The restaurant space itself, beautiful, service, great, cocktails were fine, we were very passionate for the dark and stormy, the food, was only good, nothing at all like the over hyped up nonsense will have you believe. I took it as a sign after our giant meat meal when I asked my Fiance what his favourite part was, and we both agreed that is was the dessert.  We had the bone marrow, pretzels, poutine and the chef's selection Charcut board. Poutine was ok, Brasserie makes better duck fat fried poutine. Pretzels were nice. Bone marrow was an experience, but was kinda of just an assault of uber salt and the charcuterie, I was not blown away with. Everyone raving about the mortadella, I think you are crazy. The lamb ham was my favorite on the board by far. I appreciate the house made mustard, but I think they overturn so much of it, that it doesn't have time to preserve to get any heat!  Didn't really care for the Charcut merchandise list right on the menu either.  But the milk chocolate parfait, I will give that 5 stars, that was one of the best desserts I have ever had.   I definitely want to try Charcut again, I hear you do a really awesome lunch. No hard feelings by any means, but I feel like we paid a lot for only some good food.  Can you make a milk chocolate parfait truck?  Review #22 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"We chose to eat at Charcut this week as part of our holiday downtown exploring.  We had made a reservation and got seated right away.    The tables are a biiit close together, I could hear each table's conversation just a bit too clearly, and got to smell their food while we waited for ours.   That was my only complaint though, because the food was superb.  Typically when ordering a charcuterie plate you aren't sure of the portion sizes you're going to receive.   Charcut's half board was a STACK of really unique meats.   We loved the pig's head mortadella and the salami was to die for.     Our server suggested we try the goat cheese beet salad, as its what got the chef into Top Chef Canada.   We tried it, and wow, the goat cheese was like silly putty on my plate, super fun to spread around the beets, and gave us a yummy bite of cheese with every forkful.  My husband loved the bone marrow as well, I wasn't the biggest fan, but it was tasty with the escargots.  Our service was spectacular, the server came around frequently to check in with how we were enjoying all the goodies.  Overall, excellent food, just wish we had a bit more elbow room to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack.....as it was soo close to our hotel..  I died... their Duck Fat Fried Poutine was incredible.  I kid you not, this is my first real Canadian Poutine.   Charcut Roast House made it very memorable for me.  Ambiance... BEAUTIFUL... Romantic (and also hip -by the bar).....  I kept the postcard with the little pig paperclip.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
