{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for my high school reunion and was recommended 808 for lunch. I graduated in Hawai'i, and had brought a friend to my reunion. We had lunch at 808 and I was in my happy place. 

You step inside and I instantly felt like I was back in Hawai'i. The food was so good and the staff treated us like old friends. I had the sliced teri burger and washed it down with a lilikoi passion. 

My friend isn't from the islands and her only familiarity with them, is through me. She had the Teri steak lunch and ate every bit! We'll definitely be going back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I still dream of their Garlic Chicken...I'm going to sleep right now!"}
{"text":"Husband had the garlic chicken.  I tried 808 Special with Kalua Pork & Cabbage and Korean Chicken Wings.  Both orders came with rice and a choice of macaroni or tossed greens.  We got one of each.  The garlic chicken was delicious!  The Korean Chicken Wings were delicious.  The macaroni was ok, nothing fancy.  The tossed greens is a small salad with chopped lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  The dressing was oily and barely had a flavor.  The Kalua Pork was very bland.  It didn't have much of a flavor, either.  The lady who served us was very friendly.  I would be willing to go ack and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 stars not because of the food, but because customer service. The really short girl who works the register and takes orders has been exceptionally rude the past 2 or 3 times that I have visited. A member of our group had a question about a menu item, and she replied \"Haven't you ever been here before??\". Why yes, we have, quite a bit actually. But I didn't know that meant we couldn't inquire about the menu.

If she straightens out her attitude, I'll give this place 4 stars. The food is good. The portions are a bit small. I personally like the furikake seared ahi. The chicken katsu is better at #1 Hawaiian BBQ on Lossee though."}
{"text":"Favorite Hawaiian grinds in Vegas. Being from Hawaii it's always hard to find yummy places that remind you of home. When we first moved here we found L&L, it was alright but we didn't want to go back. Driving around we found 808, decided to stop and glad we did! The staff are super friendly, the food is amazing!!!! They already know us and know when they see my daughter she likes the spam musubi. My husband always orders the garlic chicken, me, I have to try everything on the menu. Everything I've had is so tasty!! I love walking in and saying 'hey Aunty' like I'm back home. :)"}
{"text":"If your in the mood for Hawaiian food and your on the North side of Las Vegas, this is the place! Garlic Chicken and Kalbi ribs are quite tasty!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a decent grilled tuna (ahi) without paying a fortune for a meal. I've been to a few Hawaiian style restaurants, this is my new favorite. I waited for my Garlic Ahi (tuna), they will give you an option if pan fried or grilled. I picked grilled. You also have an option if mini (1 scoop of rice) or regular (2 scoops). I waited for a good 12 minutes for my food. 
I ate my food non-stop and finished it in less than 10 minutes, it was so good. Ahi was seasoned just right, grilled just right, rice was not overbearing with garlic flavor. It was just perfect. I would have paid $26-30 for it in a nice strip restaurant. I paid around $9.50. Although there are other meals between $6.00-9.00, I was so glad I ordered this. This establishment has a bright future. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really went in here looking for some lumpia but they didnt have any :(. Anyway, I got the chicken katsu with rice and macaroni salad. It wasnt disgusting but it wasn't delicious either. The katsu was crsipy but lacked flavor. The macaroni salad could use a bit more seasoning as well. This was my first time eating at this place. Though I've had better, I would still return to try something else."}
{"text":"I got the Kalbi tonight with rice and macaroni salad. The latter two were good. I got a Kalbi medium rare, which is was. The sauce was good, I just didn't expect the meat to be so chewy. I definitely want to go again and try something else when I get the chance."}
{"text":"I've been to this place quite a few times in the past but they must've gone under new management because this had to be the worse experience I've ever had here. First, the cashier (older lady) was flat out rude and made you feel unwanted. Then I ordered a canned juice and asked for a cup and she told me that those cans get the (low budget) kid water cups. Lastly, the food was absolutely terrible, it tasted old and as if it was laying around in the back and microwaved once ordered. Also tasted like it was cooked with old nasty oil. This is the last time I go to this place and I can't believe they're ok with the quality of food they serve and service they provide. 
Thanks for making sure we don't return to your business you did a great job of losing a long time customer."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious.  My wife and I ordered two plates -- the 808 special with katsu and garlic chicken, plus an order of kalbi.  Usually when we go to eat plate lunches we just share a single plate, but we were hungry and somehow we finished both plates.  It was that good.  My only gripe is that the plates were a bit on the expensive side.  I'd say prices are double what we'd pay in Hawaii.  But the quality was top-notch.  Service was also good, and you can tell the people running the place are the real deal, having lived in Hawaii at some point in the past.  I felt like I was eating at my auntie's place.

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"A place that makes you feel like home. Aunty Pili & her son runs the place along with Aunty Norma. The wifey an I are there every Friday's & sometimes Saturday's for lunch & dinner. An you might see somebody you know........"}
{"text":"A-M-A-ZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!! Everything on the menu looked so good!! Garlic chicken was the BOMB!!!!!! MUST EAT AT THIS PLACE!!! I recommend ordering ahead before you go! Gets very busy!!!"}
{"text":"Great food the best Hawaiian food I have been to in las Vegas I have tried the rest now this is the best :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I never had Hawaii in food and we want it to try it and so we made a good choice food was excellent. Seen like a family restaurant and felt very warm welcoming there was one lady we think she's the owner she's very friendly she stopped by our table and asked us how was the food and if we need a box we told no because we on vacation ,she was talking to us for a little we told her we came to car show Sema ... The food was great and the service was outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place for lunch because I was in North Las Vegas visiting some friends. Let me start by saying that this place doesn't have much of a reputation, but I wasn't put off that my friends live around the corner from 808 and haven't tried the food. 

My first impression upon walking in the door was the decor was definitely dated. It sort of reminded me of L&L. They tend to put all of their focus on the food and neglect certain aspects of the restaurant, but I don't go out to eat for the decor. Everything was clean, but a few of the plants and walls were speckled with a bit of dust. 

After minor observation of the surroundings, I was greeted by a kind lady behind the register waiting patiently for me to order my food. She had a very kind and warm smile. She was also very patient while I was quickly perusing the menu, which was a bit difficult to read. As I was waiting for my food (carryout), I noticed this woman greeting people dining in and picking up plates licked clean by happy customers. 

Now down to the meat of this review. I had the two item combo plate with green salad. It rang up close to $9...A little on the high side, but it was worth every bit of it. I ordered the Kalbi Beef and Garlic Chicken which was served with two pillowy blankets of rice. The Kalbi was second to none in Las Vegas. It was prepped differently than other places like L&L and AK. The ribs were of a thicker cut so you get more meat in each bite. Also, the rib meat is served sliced and presented on top of the cut ribs itself. The Garlic Chicken was nice and crisp. The chicken came drizzled with a garlic sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds. 

Overall, even though I didn't dine in, the food was the best in its class (in Vegas, of course). I just wish 808 was closer to where I live because I can always appreciate good Hawaiian food. Do your stomach a favor and go to 808 brah!"}
{"text":"If you are getting a lil tired of the Teriyaki Madness a couple doors down, then give 808 a shot.  Their Garlic Chicken with Miso Mayo is phenomenal!  The chicken is crispy and moist and that miso mayo is to die for.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars was that their short ribs were a lil pricy and the portion was a lil small.  Other than that, definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"WOW! The food here is amazing! Decided to try this restaurant based on the high Yelp rating in the area and I'm super happy about that decision! The Kanaka Fries were fantastic and the Garlic Chicken on rice was so tasty!
The ladies taking the food orders are so friendly and helpful and evidently are very proud of the food they serve there. We had no idea what to order when we saw the menu and when we asked for recommendations, they were happy to guide us!
Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Kalua pork and spicy chicken. My pork & cabbage was extremely salty & puree like, chicken half cold, greasy & over garlicky and not fresh. I couldn't eat the pork. Asked for something else. Was told NO. Lady said she'd replace it she went back and after 5+ min came back to inform me, the whole batch WAS salty and ruined. Replaced w/pork and gravy. It took forever to come out; I just got it to go. I heat it up today for lunch. Alot of fat & salty.. I'll give 2 stars because the staff was very friendly. .  just over all to salty and unsatisfying for me. Mac salad had chunks if potato in it. I usually go to LULU in Centennial,  and that's where I will continue to go..."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love coming here. They said they were raising the price so I don't know how much a plate is now. What I usually order is already pricey!!!! But the food is great. I highly recommend the garlic chicken with miso mayo!"}
{"text":"Just a gem out in north vegas.  Very family friendly as the staff all seems to be related.  My first time had khalbi ribs (phenomenal) and sesame chicken.  The chef asked if I wanted a sample of korean chicken, I said yes, and was treated to the most succulent zingy delight ever.  I get it every time now.  You can get it as wings or he will do it with thigh meat.

The daily specials are always great, and prices per portion are legit.  I can't recommend it highly enough, especially in an area with very few unique spots like this.  Just go!"}
{"text":"Garlic chicken is the best. Great service and great food. They do have military discount. Don't hesitate to try here."}
{"text":"The best Hawaiian food I've had in the states. Family owned and operated, awesome food and chill environment."}
{"text":"Uncle willys chicken is mind blasting!  Just make sure they have it before you go."}
{"text":"I've been eating at competing restaurants here in Vegas for years, but I just spent 2 weeks in Hawaii earlier this year and it changed my perspective. I feel like this place is the most authentic Hawaiian food I've had in Vegas, hands down--especially this close to my house. The reviews back it up! Sometimes you gotta wait a little while, but it's always worth it. Friendly staff compensates for any wait you might have. This is a MUST visit if you're in this part of town. My favorite is the Mahi Mahi."}
{"text":"Service can be kind of slow here, but I'll gladly wait for their deep fried spam musubi.  DANG that stuff is good!  Their other food is pretty yummy, too, as long as you're not trying to be health conscious!"}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner here one night, but ended up being so disappointed. The food wasn't great, a bit bland and a bit pricey for what you get. We love plates so we'll continue to go to L&L!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Hawaiian mixed plate \"BBQ.\" I was first introduced to this style of cuisine when my Aunt and Uncle decided to retire on Oahu. When I visited them in Oahu I found a \"Hawaiian BBQ\" joint and ordered the Loco Moco because the name sounded cool. I ended up sleeping away the better half of the afternoon but in all fairness, the Loco Moco was meant to alieve a righteous hangoever, which it accomplished quite nicely.

So I was totally stoked to find 808 which was just as amazing and authentic as the Hawaiian BBQ joints that are in Hawaii. To put them to the test, I ordered the Loco Moco, and true to expectations, it put me to sleep for the better half of a day (your are warned).

I returned on a second occasion and had the glazed, thinly sliced short ribs and they were absolutely amazing. This is definitely a new favorite; the prices are right, the food is great and the staff is friendly. Just go here ALREADY, Especially if you've \"over indulged\" the previous night!"}
{"text":"So I had the spicy Korean wings (very delicious, breaded and seasoned just right)and moko loco (fried egg on top of giant puck sized beef patties covered in gravy and rice on the bottom) with macaroni salad. Very good, can't eat this everyday but it's a great weekend indulgence. Very good to try at least once if you are getting bored with food like I was. Not in a food rut anymore."}
{"text":"I really liked this place the first time I went there, I had the garlic chicken with the miso mayo which was very good! Second time I had the firecracker chicken with the rice and Mac which was even better than the garlic chicken cause it was crispier but the third time it was horrible! The chicken was chewy and it was soggy, theMac was grainy. I will say that the service is always great but the food is a gamble. Do not get the food to go I think they rush cooking it and doesn't come out as good as if you ate it there."}
{"text":"I was craving lau lau and turned to yelp, which lead me to 808. They serve it on Friday's only . I've been here before awhile back so I knew the food would be good .  
     I chose the lau lau plate you have a choice of kalua pig , beef stew or tripe stew . I chose the tripe stew. It also comes with a little container of lomi salmon and rice of course.
     The lau lau had a big piece of pork and fat and a nice piece of butter fish.  Lau lau was avg size , pretty solid as far as lau lau goes.  
    The tripe stew was delicious it had celery , potato , carrots and tripe of course. 
                 The stew was a tad bit thin for me and needed more tripe, but the flavor was spot on , the moment I put the first spoonful in my mouth , my taste buds said WOW!
   Only if my wife ate tripe , I would be making it right now. 
     Oh yeah for an appetizer? I had to get a spam musubi , they were piled right next to the cash register(smart move 808) and I could not resist.
    It was a solid spam musubi with teri sauce and still warm :) 
    When the craving hits me for lau lau, I will make the long drive to 808:)"}
{"text":"Very friendly Aloha Spirit. Told her it was our first time here and she offered us a delicious sample without me asking. 

Delicious Garlic chicken - can ask for special mayo on the side. 

Tried fried spam musubi - A-M-A-Z-I-N-G (tip- add sriracha for a kick to mellow out the sweet sauce)

Bowl portion is enough for lunch - it comes with rice only,so no salad or Mac salad)

Da 808 special is a great option - pick two of the meats to try with rice and salad."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best Hawaiian restaurants I've gone to in North Las Vegas. A very welcoming atmosphere with great customer service. The food here is absolutely delicious provided with a great variety on the menu. I will definitely pay more visits."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kalua pork and cabbage with rice and mac salad. The mac salad was average, the pork was bland and the rice was stale. It was like eating 3 day old rice......gross. I was disappointed with the quality of food and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Good food and good service...the wait is a little long but that's because they make it as u order...fresh:) portion size is good..true Hawaii style home cooking."}
{"text":"Norma and her clan of awesome chefs know what's up! Their food is DELICIOUS! Make sure you don't leave without ordering the fried spam masubi!!!!"}
{"text":"Kalbi Ribs was good and the Garlic Chicken was ok. They give you two very small scoops of rice so I had to order a extra scoop. The macaroni salad had no taste and would suggest putting a little salt and pepper to make it eatable!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for dinner and loved it! We had the garlic chicken and short rib plate. It was fantastic! We will definetly continue to visit this place for great Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Although it was far from my place but we tried to manage to drop by yesterday after we went to flea market because my partner thought they have ahi poke just like we were used to get when we were back in Hawaii lol. Anyways, it was my first time trying on their firecracker chicken... it was really delicious and I'm sold to it. 

The place is so small and we were debating if we should try it out or not because they had a long queue already but I guess we should just suck it up a little bit.  I'm glad I had the patience because that chicken was my favorite now."}
{"text":"Really nice place.  The staff was helpful and the garlic chicken and Katsu chicken were outstanding."}
{"text":"I love 808 Hawaii Grill the BBQ chicken and salad with rice is my favorite !!!!"}
{"text":"Aloha Friday!!!  Hawaiian plate at 808HMP is the best!! Laulau, Kalua Pig, Chicken Long Rice, Lomi Salmon, Haupia, and of course Rice!!!  I am so glad to have this place near home.  I eat here every week at least 1-2 times.  Which is why I am fluffy!!"}
{"text":"So bomb!!! I love this place, compared to the other hawaiian food places in town this one is the best. I really will never get sick of this place, the whole restaurant has good vibes and the people that work there are awesome!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly enough and the food was okay. We ordered the barbeque beef and garlic chicken. Garlic chicken was good, but the beef was a little bland and dry. I would return for the garlic chicken only."}
{"text":"The garlic chicken and pork chops are excellent. But they really shined when they did a special happy birthday song and dessert for my friend without being asked just because they knew it was her birthday. Mahalo. My friends and I will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite Hawaiian restaurant in Vegas!  I almost always get the kalbi and the garlic chicken.  Wanting to try others but they're too good to pass up!  Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"It's your standard Hawaiian food with the exception of the garlic chicken.  It's the best thing here and the portions are huge. Also the kalbi is decent but just a little too fatty."}
{"text":"My husband's favorite hawaiian food. I was hesitant to try it at first, but the garlic chicken is to die for. This will become a regular for sure."}
{"text":"I eat out a lot and mite be one of the worse Hawaii style place I ever went to in Vegas. Service slow, you don't get a lot for what you pay for, food taste ok. Really disappointed. Actually first Hawaiian place That disappointed me. Doesn't take much to make this local boy happy. =("}
{"text":"Im born and raised in Hawai'i and i was very disappointed with the service and actual food I bought from here. Food was bland and you could tell the food wasn't made with Aloha or even any effort. Tastes like its made for quantity and quality. I tried to order the Kalbi but they said they were out. Us Hawaiians love our Kalbi short ribs. You should never be out haha. But all in all this place reminds me of any other Hawaiian food place like Aloha kitchen. If I want Good Hawaiian food I'll go to Island Flavor from now on. Now that's good Hawaiian grindz."}
{"text":"Great food. But the lady on the cashier is very very cranky! Food reminds me of hawaii. Lady reminds me of grumpy from snow white! Three stars for you grumpy!!!!"}
{"text":"First time there I was recommended the garlic chicken and it was delicious. Very happy with the service and I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Traveling from the South side to the North side to check this place out for the first time. Heard that the Garlic Chicken is a hot item! The restaurant is decent size with table seating. The menu had really good items. Bonus on the Mix plate option - you can select two different items on a plate and choice of macaroni salad or mixed green salad. 
They were out of Garlic Chicken! Sad! Staff said they were busy today & ran out. Items ordered: Deep Fried Spam Musubi, Fried Noodles & 2 Mixed plates - Kalbi & Hamburger Steak with grilled onions and mushrooms, & the second Mix Plate - Kalbi & Korean Chicken wings (mild). Side note when ordering the Kalbi on the mix plate there's an extra charge of $4.00. Didn't mind paying. Food served hot and fresh! Portions good size. The Kalbi was cooked good & portioned well. The food was very good! Will have return to try the Garlic Chicken!"}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD.
I think 4 people work there including the owners. All of them are very nice and friendly. They remember your name and what you eat. The chef even pokes his head out of the kitchen-to-dining room window to say hi.
These are a few of my favorite things: Garlic shrimp, garlic chicken, bbq chicken, salmon, daily and weekly specials.
They give military discounts. A plus.
The only other Hawaiian restaurants I've been to in LV are L&L and Aloha Kitchen and let me tell you that 808 destroys those two. In fact, I never plan on going back to those other two places again because if I did, I'd be too busy wishing I was at 808 that I wouldn't be able to enjoy their sub-par food."}
{"text":"This is the ONLY place to visit for Kalbi ribs.  The food is amazing and the family atmosphere makes this a beautiful dining experience."}
{"text":"The best local food in Vegas! HANDS DOWN. The garlic chicken with miso mayo the chicken katsu curry the ribs YUM, & my FAVORITE the hamburger steak MY OH MY!! Everything is Suuuper ONO. Not to mention the staff, many servings of Aloha here!!! The only thing I'd change is to live closer than I already do :0) on a scale from 1 to 5 stars I'd give them 10!"}
{"text":"Service was as excellent as it could get. Ahi Katsu special was as good as it sounds. My daughter had the kalbi ribs that they cooked to her preference and even cut into little pieces which saved me about 20 mins. The  Mac salad has potatoes in it, nice touch. The fries were salty but delicious. Definitely headed back to try the garlic shrimp."}
{"text":"This place is alway good for take out. I always get the oriental salad with garlic chicken.  My husband keeps making me try new things and they are always good, but I LOVE this salad. We  sat inside today and the presentation of the salad is amazing.  I had no idea how beautiful they plate their food cause it's always in Togo containers. Come in sit down and enjoy great food that looks pretty too."}
{"text":"LOVE THEIR FIRECRACKER CHICKEN! Food is Ono, worked get plenty aloha...how much better can it get. I was missing Maui till I came and ate here. :)"}
{"text":"I had the garlic chicken with garlic ahi tuna plate... Garlic chicken was pure heaven ... Ahi was good but I forgot to order it seared instead of grilled.. So it was a bit over cooked because of my error in ordering... But overall very good!"}
{"text":"I live in Henderson and it's totally worth the drive to come out here for some good Hawaiian food.  It's in the middle of a plaza where there's a poke place a few restaurants down, but they serve poke here too. I come here for the chicken though. It's the juiciest and tastiest Hawaiian style chicken I've had since living in Vegas.

I've made the drive out here several times, and I've gotten the Furikake chicken, grilled chicken, and garlic chicken. Each visit has yet to disappoint me. They get the chicken right every time and it was so good, I picked it up one last time before I moved out of Vegas. No matter where you live, it's definitely worth the trip to come out here for some fantastic Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"this place is solid.   the kalbi is winnas.  many places the kalbi is not as good, the fried noodles is great, hard to go wrong with very many things here."}
{"text":"We chose 808 HMP for our son's graduation party..on graduation day. From planning to delivery everything went smoothly. With Brenton's catering expertise, his recommendations on how many pans of food to order for the amount of people invited saved us a lot of money.  We over estimated and HE made the right adjustments.  We had great comments about how incredible the food was.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND 808 MHP for all of your catering needs.  They go above and beyond."}
{"text":"First time coming here. I ordered the Teri Beef Bowl. The meat wasn't warm as I'd expect. I'm not sure if it has been sitting out for awhile before it was served to me, but the flavor of the meat was really good."}
{"text":"I ordered the garlic chicken and beef. Good flavor but the meat was too fatty for my taste. I've also never had Hawaiian food so my review is basted soley on my personal taste."}
{"text":"Big Fan of Hawaiin Food in general, but this place blows L&L out the water!!!! Must try!!!!"}
{"text":"My experience recently pushed me to write this review. A friend and I came to visit Las Vegas for a weekend and had a rough first day. After experiencing some disappointments, we decided the next day, to eat here. IT's not our first time, but it reassured that it definitely wouldn't be our last. All I remember is instantly being overwhelmed with comfort as I got my order and took my first bite. My friend even looked over and we both just read that we both were surprised at the taste of the food.  I can't say nothing but good things about this place! Honestly, this food is the closest thing I've gotten to Hawaiian food since I got back from Oahu. Seriously, I think this restaurant is one of the top 10 restaurants I visit when I go to Las Vegas and it always hits the spot. If you want to transform your day instantly, this is the ticket. 

Their food is great. It's sweet, savory, crunchy, unctuous, and hearty all at once. It defines what Hawaiian food is and is very accurate to the true thing. I personally think that everything on the menu is delicious, so you can't go wrong when you go here. That's just one of those things that make this restaurant such a great place for me, because it is not only delicious, but deliver greatness in each of their items they offer. I love their kalbi ribs, moco loco, and chicken variations. These are the best! Even the salad is amazing because of their dressing. The portions are huge, and always come out more than satisfied. And that's saying a lot because my appetite is black hole level. 

Aside from their food, the service is great too. They are always kind, and deliver your food to you when you're eating in. I believe that's where the heart of this place lies really. So let's look at this: Food quality: CHECK! Food quantity: CHECK! Authenticity: CHECK! Food Variety and Appeal: CHECK and CHECK! Service: CHECK! You can't go wrong here folks. I highly recommend this place especially if you're an out-of-towner, because I guarantee it will hype up your experience"}
{"text":"Thee ABSOLUTE BEST HAWAIIAN FOOD IVE EVER TASTED!!! I always get the 808 mixed plate with Garlic chicken and Kalbi short ribs and green salad. It never lets me down!!! I get extra miso mayo on the side for some extra dipping. I LOVE 808 HAWAIIAN Food!!! If you are in the Vegas area it is a MUST TRY!!! So excited about it after writing  this review that in about to go and get some!!!!"}
{"text":"The garlic chicken is amazing. The miso mayo made the meal. I am still unsure what is in a lot of what they sell but everything I have tried has been great.  Last time we were there they had a slice of pumpkin desert that we took home to eat. Omg it was amazing.  Like pumpkin pie with a nut crust and whip topping on top. Now I want one just tiping this. I'm not sure if this is a regular item but it should be. The only thing I would change about the place is the decor."}
{"text":"So the first time we went there a couple weeks ago was very good. Everyone was so nice and friendly and I was raving the next day to my friends. Then we went last nite and ordered 39 $ worth of food. Tipped 5$ cash. Food order on the card. Asked for it to eat there and they packed it to go. I know they close at 9 and I know they want to go home at the end of the day. We all do. But if ur restaurant close at 9 and we come at 820 u pack out stuff to go? That was kinda rude. But I think it was cuz the owners were there the first time and this time they weren't there or we d idnt see them. And we ordered saimin. It's soup. The components of the soup are packed separate and we share so we just said oh well let's go home then since they obviously want us to go. It's 25 minute drive for us from home. Maybe we no go no more"}
{"text":"I'd fly back to Vegas just to eat here. The short ribs were worth every buck! A must try."}
{"text":"This is a great find in Las Vegas.  It's a bit of a drive for those of us that live in Summerlin but it's worth it!  

We drove out there for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon.  Three of us ordered the garlic chicken with miso mayo and I ordered the won ton min.  The chicken blew my family members away.  Wonderful flavor and great mac salad to boot.  I really enjoyed the won ton and the saimin noodles in my soup.  The rest was a little too salty for me, but good noodles alone are worth it for me and besides, others might not think too much of the sodium.  The broth flavor is very traditional Hawaiian flavor and even has seaweed in it, kamaboko, sweet egg, green onion and ham plus char shiu.  Sadly, they were out of the Hawaii-imported fried saimin.  The friendly lady there said they get shipped in every Thursday and the person who took the order had been out the previous week.  Next time fo sure!  

It took an unusually long time for my family to get their chicken.  The same lady above kept saying sorry and even offered to heat up my soup for me and gave us a free piece of pumpkin cake!  I was blown away.  Over the top customer service.  She even chatted us up about the part of the Islands she's from.  (We are from the middle of Oahu.)  All in all, a great experience!  I even bought a t-shirt!"}
{"text":"Great food and service the garlic chicken is the best this is a must try if you are in the area"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The 808 mixed plate with Garlic Chicken, Kalbi Ribs & Green Salad is what I get every time."}
{"text":"I had the garlic chicken (DELICIOUS) and the portions are huge.  All the food was amazing, the staff was super nice and friendly...definitely willing to try again.... And again.... And again!!!"}
{"text":"So happy this establishment is so close to our home. The food is great from the garlic chicken to the spam musubi. You cant go wrong ordering anything from their menu! I had the BBQ beef with the macaroni salad and I couldn't get enough of it. Will definitely be going back when ever I'm in the mood for good Hawaiian food!"}
{"text":"So good. Enjoyed the authentic feel of the place. Love me some poke and furikake ahi/mahi mahi! Every plate was awesome. Definitely satisfies your island cravings."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places to visit when I visit Vegas and want to get some local Hawaiian food. The service here is friendly. I ordered the mixed sesame chicken and shrimp mixed plate. Their servings are generous! I recommend asking for the chicken katsu sauce for their sesame chicken to dip in, tastes great. I plan to visit again on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been coming here twice a week for lunch the past few weeks. The food is awesome and affordable. It's way better than going to a fast food chain. 

I rotate between these:

Loco Moco mini $5.50
Hula Pack w/BBQ chicken $4.50
Shoyu Chicken mini $4.95

All the employees are nice. I call in my order so I don't have to wait. I don't even need to tell them my name anymore!"}
{"text":"What is not to love at this place. There's a lot of Hawaiian BBQ in this town but this one is by far the best one that I have a pleasure of eating at. Everything's fresh, great poke. Everything you order is good, great taste, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Was in the area for work again. XD 

Came here later in the day this time. around 2ish on a tuesday afternoon. had a few people dining in but they mostly left by the time i got my food. 

Ordered a furikake chicken and the garlic chicken again (double check xD) 

Order came out fairly quick today. 2 scoops of rice, 1 scoop of mac salad, and the two meats. 

Mac salad has cubed of potato in it. interesting XD adds a nice texture to it. 

Garlic chicken. yeah not enough garlic taste :( i almost feel like im eating a chicken katsu with some aioli sauce (mayo based) 

Furikake chicken. same type of fried chicken i believe, but topped with furikake. intesting but not as amazing as some people make it out to be.

If i come to this place again, imma try the loco moco next time ! heh !"}
{"text":"Gave them another chance... This time the food was better, the portions were better, and their attitudes were much better. I am hoping my past experiences were exceptions, as I did enjoy the food and my overall dinig experience this time. I will return again soon and hope for a similar experience."}
{"text":"A little piece of Hawaii in Vegas!! I love this place, the employees are great,  they treat you like you're in their house. You need to try the garlic chicken, it's lightly breaded and fried to crispy perfection, a thin glaze of sauce is drizzled with the exact right amount of flavors, enjoy it, I get it every time I visit!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to spot for Hawaiian food.  Their Kalbi Ribs have to be the best in town; and their Garlic Chicken, don't even get me started.  Do yourself a favor and check this spot out!"}
{"text":"If your from the islands and have been in Vegas for a while or just wanting some food from back home. This is the place to come to. Everythin is ono. I wish they would open one up on the southwest side of town"}
{"text":"great hawaiian spot in north las vegas. Had the hi-style beef and garlic chicken. Food came out within 10 minutes. Great service. Garlic Chicken was the highlight of my meal. It hit the spot."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but I'll pay it everytime to get a taste of home. Very few 808 restaurants are run by actual 808 staff... and these guys take care you!! ALOHA!!"}
{"text":"First time at any Hawaiian place--wow so good! They give you a sample if you've never been. Had the short ribs & pork/cabbage & sampled some garlic chicken which was amazing. You can replace the rice with extra salad which was a bonus. I will be back."}
{"text":"We read the review and it lives up to them. The tank full of fish was great. We got to sit right next to it. Service was great. The servings were large but very good. It was a very good value! I would come back here again."}
{"text":"The BEST Hawaiian food in Vegas period end of story. You disagree = you don't know what you are talking about. Fish = awesome quality. Garlic chicken = unbelievable. Fried spam masubi = perfection. This is the best of all by a long long long way."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food I've  ever had. I travel 30 miles to come here no where else compares."}
{"text":"Had to get my rice fix, after buying Poke from Poke Express a few doors down.  I ordered the Garlic Chicken after talking to the hostess for a recommendation and boy was she right.  The Garlic Chicken was absolutely delicious.  It was cooked perfectly and was drizzled with an onolicious sauce.  

Located in a small strip mall a bit north of The Strip.  Definitely worth your time to check this place out.  Staff were friendly and I know you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ Beef and to be quite honest, it was okay. Once I added hot sauce and soy sauce to the rice everything came together nicely. The side of Mac was really good. Yes, I would come here again. 

Today was the warmest Spring day of the season and it truly was a gorgeous day. Most places were packed due to being Saturday. 808 was no exception and that's why I would gladly return. It a nice restaurant in a busy shopping center."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how great the food is here and the funny thing is we have been to other restaurants in the area and kept putting this one on hold. They are also so helpful and nice.  I tried their fried noodles with garlic chicken and was so good, also we tried their BBQ fries which comes as a dipping sauce and is SO YUMMY. We will definitely be back to try other items. What a great find!"}
{"text":"there's little places in las vegas that have such great local hawaiian food and this is one of them. by far one of a handful of local places to go and get some real ono food. from da loco moco to the garlic chicken, there's nothing you can go wrong with on the menu. if you're lucky you can catch one of their specials and have a dinner that would make gordan ramsey customers jealous. top notch stuff, def a place I recommend!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  My new favorite place to eat... Loving there Spam Masubi though.... I highly recommend coming to eat here if you love Hawaiian food..."}
{"text":"In a nice shopping center we have a salmon special in the garlic ahi tuna.  They were both great!  About 25 dollars with a couple of sodas."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Hawaiian restaurant in the whole valley.. (believe me we've tried them all..lol). The fried musubi is awesome and they have the best teri beef!! It's always tender! The staff is great! I've never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"When we are feeling home sick we head to 808. The food is delicious!! Very homemade and the portions are large. The Aloha spirit comes thru the service and each dish is made with love."}
{"text":"Wow!  It's been a while since we've been back!  Sorry 808!  Brenton the Chef always has some awesome daily specials going on and their usual daily specials always hit the spot.

Today happened to be the daily special for ahi tofu patties.  It came highly recommended by all of the staff and they were not kidding!  The mixture of ahi tuna and tofu was the perfect ratio.  The breading was perfectly crispy on the outside and the mayo dressing drizzled on top was a fantastic compliment.  Both me and my man wolfed it down like there was no tomorrow!

Other good ol' standby's:
1.  Loco Moco - for gravy and ooey gooey egg lovers
2.  Hamburger Steak - for the savory gravy lover
3.  Beef Stew - for those cold winter days
4.  Saimin Salad 

Tip:  Looks like the word is spreading that they are tasty, so beware of long lines.  Plan accordingly and like other yelpers mentioned, it might not be so bad to call in and order ahead.

Conclusion:  It's a family run restaurant where they treat you like family and they feed you with comforting Hawaiian favorites."}
{"text":"I love the fried spam musubi*licking fingers*
Love! Love! this place! I forgot what else I ordered...but it was oh so Ono!!!!"}
{"text":"The ribs is amazing ! And the garlic chicken is a must try. But I can't explain in words how horrible the service is. The lady is so rude and doesn't care what so ever about you. You have to be really really nice to her just so she doesn't give you a hard time. I often carve the food here but I hesitate due to how awful the service is. It's like you have to please her. If you asked for miso mayo she will charge you and depending on her mood she might give it to you in a bigger or smaller container base on how nice you are to her. I'm sorry but the restaurant business is so competitive you shouldn't treat customers like they are a bother to you."}
{"text":"The food tastes just as good as it does back home!!! The portions are big and the prices aren't too bad either."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite Hawaiian spot around town. Everything I've tried was very tasty, cooked to perfection. I'm actually quite impressed with their food. Good portion size (enough to share with someone else) but you'll pay about $10 for pretty much any combo you order. Try the Kalbi Ribs & Garlic Chicken combo!! You won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but $17.95 for two pieces of cut up short ribs is really expensive as far as plate lunches goes.  The beef stew was good. Nothing special for $11.95 and a side of garlic chicken was $6.95 for a small plate. They were all out of wonton min which is what I really wanted. If this place existed in Hawaii they would fail as no one on the island would pay almost 18 bucks for a short rib plate. They did however have chili pepper water for the beef stew. I dunno I wanted to try something else than my regular go to spot Island Flavor and maybe I'm just spoiled by them cause their kalbi plate is massive you get four thick slices. I would come back here but would try the other dishes and stay away from the over priced short ribs."}
{"text":"808 is great! While their macaroni salad may not be my thing, their garlic chicken has to be on of the best quick dishes in North Las Vegas. Their Kalua pork and Korean wings are also excellent. I can't wait to try even more of their menu! Awesome place."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 4 star review for now. We've tried only 3 different plates, but so far they were good. 

We ordered the 808 special with the garlic chicken and kalbi ribs and right away it reminded my husband of this restaurant he used to go to back in the day in Maui. The garlic chicken was so crispy with the tempura batter they use. Creamy miso sauce on top of the kalbi ribs is yummy. 

Unfortunately,I was greatly disappointed when I went in and got their Friday special of the Pork Lau Lau that comes with chicken long rice and supposed to have lomi-lomi salmon and haupia. Well the lau lau wasn't all what I expected, like the ones in Hawaii which are big, full of butterfish and fatty pork. My lau lau was small, dry and not tasty. Plus, my plate didn't come with the salmon nor the haupia, which was a bummer. However, what saved the plate for me was the chicken long rice which was really flavorful. 

Maybe, one day I will find a Hawaiian restaurant out here in Vegas that can serve up a bombass pork lau lau like in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Good, casual restaurant serving Hawaiian comfort food. Friendly service. Generous portions. Brisk takeout business. Daily specials and food overall is tasty. Will go again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Brah if you'd looking for the real Hi kind grinds this the spot boo. Hands down the best loco moco in Vegas. And there garlic chicken is to kill for. Definitely come and check it out."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is delicious! Especially their garlic chicken, kalbi and fried saimin. I just took my boyfriend here for the first time and now he's hooked. Great place to go if you want local Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Just ok. Stopped here because of all the great reviews. They were all out of kalbi even though they'd only been open an hour. Maybe that was our problem. We both had garlic chicken. Not garlicky at all, and deep fried. Kalua pork was mushy and reminiscent of canned tuna. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Let's start with walking in, how awkward. 

No one greets you, an older woman sits in what looks like pajamas with a pen in her ear and carries around the portable phone. Even worst is the punk rock cashier who doesn't smile and has her arms crossed the whole time as if you're inconveniencing her this fine afternoon. God forbid we took too long as it was my first time and wasn't sure what to get, and every time I asked a question my boyfriend answered as she gave me blank stares like I'm a retard.

Oh, and I take it back the kitchen was the only thing exciting as they did greet me while I was attempting to order, probably the only time I felt welcome. 

Boyfriend got Kahlua pig.. I almost thought it was carnitas since it was on the salty side. I ended up with garlic chicken which was actually delicious but it was drowned in so much mayo I thought I was gonna turn into Agustus Glut (Willy Wonka). 

THE WORST PART.. How on earth do you have overcooked rice?! Oh man, it was so unpleasant, I was convinced it was mashed potatoes! 

We decided to take the rest to-go and asked for a box.... yeah it had dirt in it as said punk rock girl stares inside as she handed it to us. So I got up and got another one. 

Pretty lame adventure."}
{"text":"We really hope that they open up somewhere else in North Las Vegas.  They are such a great family and they actually care about their customers.  We really miss them and the amazing food they provided for us!!! Now we have no where to get our cone sushi :("}
{"text":"Most of their chicken plates are worth trying. Garlic chicken is my favorite.  Decent prices. Friendly staff. Must try in north Vegas."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Hawaiian Food I have had in Vegas. If you are craving Hawaiian Food make the trip to this place. It has all everything you would want to eat and more. My wife had one of their daily specials which was a 3 course meal that included a small appetizer ,Miso Pork w/ garlic Mash, and a dessert. I got a mix plate with firecracker chicken and short ribs and an order of fried musubi. It was all super freaking awesome."}
{"text":"Best hawaiian food in town!!! Closest thing to home, I love this place!!! Everything is Da Kine!!! You will love this place, Pure Hawaiian Style!!! If you love Island food this is the best place to go to. Just check out the other reviews. Yummy, Yummy, and Yummy!!!! :) :)"}
{"text":"I never thought Hawaiian food could be this gourmet! If you've ever been to L&L, forget that experience, be it good or bad. 808's garlic chicken and ono chicken will blow your mind. And they take their fried musubi to a whole new level, you can't even tell it's spam. This endorsement comes with a 100% guarantee you will not leave this place disappointed. It will literally be your new favorite place."}
{"text":"DON'T order online if you're in a hurry. Lol. They started making my food as I got there, a half hour after I placed the order. But... they got it out pretty quick, and the food is quite tasty. I'm loving the garlic chicken, and the bbq beef has great flavor. I'll most likely be back lol n"}
{"text":"Yet another great Hawaiian style plate lunch place that reminds me of home! Awesome food and great portions and prices as well. Phone orders available and choke parking as well. Wish it were a little closer to me but i cant be to picky haha. Places like this make me less homesick when in search of good comfort food from back home. The last time i went i ordered the Loco Moco, and wow the burgers were so thick and tender with the mac salad too! Definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars only because of the service and wait time. I ordered my food, then a group of 4 guys behind me ordered, then as I'm waiting they received two of their plates first, the two girls behind the counter took their breaks at the same time, received their food from the lady covering the counter as they were on break, then after almost half an hour, I received my two plates and poke. Other than the service which is extremely slow, I will say their food is amazing!"}
{"text":"A Hawaiian patient recommended this place to my boyfriend, so I came in when work brought me on a rare trip to this side of town. Posted menu is a bit difficult to read and understand, and the cashier asked if it was my first time- I said yes, and was handed a paper copy but not given any recommendations or info, which I found odd.

Prices seemed a bit higher than other Hawaiian spots in Vegas and  several dishes were listed as \"market price\" which was a turn off in a fast-casual spot with counter service.  Ordered the 808 combo with teriyaki beef, garlic chicken, spam, rice, and saimin, and added on a spam musubi. The garlic chicken was great, and the musubi was decent, but I wasn't thrilled with anything else- the teri beef in particular was small, thin, and tough to eat. 

Order came out fairly fast, and while I waited I noticed a posted special for poke bowls, which probably would have been a better pick for me. Might give this spot another try if I'm in the area again but this place was lacking the aloha spirit and flavors."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a great Hawaiian food place & this is it. I love the lunch special, especially the garlic chicken & macaroni salad...they are DELICIOUS!  I have tried other menu items but the garlic chicken is #1. I also appreciate the military discount & the friendly staff...keep doing an outstanding job!"}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Las Vegas because my daughter and her volleyball were competing in the SCVA 31st Annual Las Vegas Classic.  Prior to arriving to Las Vegas, 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plate was one of several restaurants I had book marked and planned to visit.  After my daughter's tournament ended on Monday, I brought the entire family to get our Hawaiian food grinds on.  After our visit, anyone visiting Las Vegas and is a fan of Hawaiian food, then 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plate should not be missed.

808 Hawaiian is a pleasant restaurant.  It's not a big restaurant, but it can accommodate a good amount of people.  There are booths along both sides of the restaurant's walls and there are table and chairs lining the middle.  I thought the booths with the wicker basket backings was a nice touch.  The decor is minimal with Hawaiian still pictures hanging on the walls.  There are two televisions mounted high for your viewing pleasure.  808 Hawaiian's menu is not complicated and has a good selection of food.  The ladies behind the counter who take your order were very friendly.  808 Hawaiian is an order first, take your seat, and the food is brought out to you type restaurant.

The reason I took one star away from 808 Hawaiian was because they ran out of poke when we tried to order around 1:30pm.  Also, my kids ordered the Teri Beef bowls, which although they were tasty, the amount of food served was small for the $8 price.  My kids like what they ordered, but it wasn't value for the money.  The main reason why I gave 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plate a strong 4 star rating was solely for the Loco Moco plate I ordered.  808 Hawaiian's Loco Moco was the best Loco Moco I've eaten EVER.  I really loved the white sticky that comes with this plate.  The consistency of the rice was perfect.  This Loco Moco had two large sized hamburger patties cooked just right and seasoned where the meat was really tasty.  The gravy that covered the patties and the rice was slurp worthy and is making me salivate just thinking about it.  The two sunny side eggs on top of everything was cooked just right and yolk flowed perfectly as I broke it.  Not only was this Loco Moco delicious, it was very satisfying.  Must.  Order.  Plate.

I'm glad both my kids play volleyball because there will more future Las Vegas volleyball tournaments.  Just on 808 Hawaiian's Loco Moco plate alone, I will make it a point to visit this restaurant when we visit Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"Oh my God. This food was so good, I cried over it. I have only ever had L&L, etc. I have been so, so ignorant. I didn't know Hawaiian food could been even more delicious. I'm gonna marry the ribs here. So thick! And so tasty. 6 large pieces came in my 1/2 and 1/2 lunch plate and a huge heap of delicious BBQ beef! The hurricane fries need a description on the GrubHub site. I was expecting something a little different. But, it doesn't matter. Everything else was f_@#ing amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful people, tasty food. You can't usually find quality Hawaiian food on the mainland. Real kalua pork, nice n smoky n not greasy! Now I know why they call LV the 9th island! Go!"}
{"text":"Good Hawaiian food but prices keep going up. My kids love the garlic chicken."}
{"text":"My son's favorite place! He loves his hamburger steak! Everything on their menu is delicious! Food is always fresh and the taste and quality are consistent! Friendly staff with lots of Aloha especially Aunty! If you haven't been here yet you should definitely give it a try! Best Hawaiian Food on the North side of town!"}
{"text":"Living in Phoenix whenever I visit family in Vegas this is the first place I stop on my way to my families house, every single time. I usually call in my order when I'm on the freeway so I know it'll be ready when I pick it up. This has to be one of the best Hawaiian spots in Vegas, hands down. A small, family owned joint that serves a variety of island specialties that everyone will enjoy. My wife and I usually always get the mixed plate with garlic chicken and ono chicken. We talk about trying something else, but always come back to our original order because the food is just that good. The restaurant itself is in a small strip mall in North Las Vegas and there really isn't much to be expected from it, but the food speaks for itself. If you're from the islands or just love Hawaiian food, trust me and go in and order."}
{"text":"Had the 808 mixed plate with the garlic chicken and BBQ chicken....outstanding!!!!! Had the mac and cheese Hawaiian style its a cold macaroni salad Very good. Not a fan of rice so i could have used more sauce to mix rice with."}
{"text":"Always good service and ono food, my favorite is the mix plate ( you can choose your own) my personal favorite is the garlic chicken and roast pork mix plate with grilled mushrooms and onions. Sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today and was not disappointed but amazed how good the Korean chicken wings with garlic chicken combo. They have just earned my business."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fried saimin is awesome! Garlic chicken is bomb and Kalbi is on point! 
Service is great as well!"}
{"text":"By far, the garlic chicken with miso mayo is one of the most delicious things I have tasted in Vegas. It is basically chicken katsu fried to perfection and topped with some teriyaki/soy sauce (unsure of what exactly) and a miso mayo blend. The result is a complex, flavorful masterpiece. All I can say is: Wow, gotta try this.

The entrees come with a salad (I'd go with the green salad since it is a fresh alternative to the mac salad, which might make the meal too rich overall) and rice. There are also refills on drinks and great service. 

My friend and I brought in some poke from poke express next door and they didn't mind that we ate the poke with our meal (or they didn't know).

P.S. There is a military discount: 10%!"}
{"text":"The food is Great! 

First time here the woman at the counter saw that I had no idea and gave me a free sample of their garlic chicken.... YUM! It was so good! Best Hawaiian spot I've had since arriving in Vegas over a year ago. Highly Recommend because of the quality of service and great food."}
{"text":"We started using 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate in Uber Eats in Las Vegas and found this to be a very great service especially if you couldn't leave the house or office.
808 HI Mixed Plate is a touch of Home food when you're here in Vegas, all the food is great and very tasty like home 
I would recommend to try it, you'll love it!!
The people there are so nice and friendly too"}
{"text":"Everyone knows Vegas is the 9th island and with that, comes the island style grub cravings to be satisfied. I used to frequent 808 about 2-3 years ago. Unfortunately I never got a chance to leave any reviews. Most recently though, my family and I came in for lunch on Friday and the food just wasn't the same. I raved to the hubby about how delicious the garlic chicken was. But it was soggy when I finally had my first bite. Total disappointment. I got a bento (totally forgot the catchy name of it) that included garlic chicken, fried saimin, a scoop of white rice, 1 slice of fried spam and beef teriyaki pieces. My sis and I shared that bento and some ahi poke from next door (review to follow). My hubby got a plate of kalua pig and cabbage that included 2 schools of white rice and a scoop of mac salad. He totally devoured as much as he could with a third of kalua and a scoop of rice to spare. We washed everything down with some Hawaiian Sun. They had quite a selection to choose from. Going back to my bento, everything else was alright, not good, not bad. Hubby said if he weren't so hungry, he probably wouldn't have eaten as much. He thought it was more on the dry side, but had good salty and smoke flavor. I totally agreed with his comment. The women working the counters and bringing food out are absolute sweethearts and explained all my millions of questions regarding what was included in the bentos, packs and plates. The menu has also changed quite significantly since I was here a couple years ago."}
{"text":"Great local food. Authentic Hawaiian choices. Local aunties running the place. Exactly as expected. 
We had Teriyaki chicken Musubi, Katsu Musubi, saimin & loco moco (hamburger patties, gravy, rice and sunny side up eggs on top). Mac salad was delish, on point! 
Tastes just like home with the island style flavors and many choices to choose from. 
I wish we had eateries like this in Cali."}
{"text":"First timer. Staff extremely friendly showing that aloha spirit. Lunch special garlic chicken was delicious and I could not finish it all. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Ever just crave for a good Hawaiian food place that's not L&L or Aloha kitchen??? Not that there's really anything wrong with those two places, but sometimes you want the REAL AUTHENTIC Hawaiian food. Well, this is just the place.

We came in about 30 minutes before they closed, and usually places will give you attitude or try and rush you...this place is nowhere to that. My friend and I are really indecisive and considering the fact that it was my first time, I wanted to look through the menu. I finally made up my mind and the lady in the cashier was so patient with me. I asked if I can order a 2 meat of my choice entree,  because that's what I was in the mood for and she said yes they do that. Although it's an extra $5, I told her I didn't mind. Ordered the Kalbi and Katsu plate and as soon as we got it...i couldn't help but dig in. The sauce they have with the chicken Katsu was also very different compared to the one they usually have at L&L or aloha kitchen.

Overall, I give this place huge 5 stars. They were very welcoming when we walked in, and even brought our food to our table. Soon as it hit 8:30, they didn't rush us at all, but of course we were considerate enough to hurry and leave. Definitely have to try this spot if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from fellow Yelpers and finally made it out to give it a try! Took me a while to decide on what to get, but eventually decided on garlic chicken. There were a few people in line ahead of me since it was lunch hour, however, it was kind of odd that my food came out before theirs and about 5 min after I ordered...

The garlic chicken was good and had a perfect amount of garlic flavor. It came with 2 scoops of rice and 1 small scoop of mac salad...just wish they gave more because it was so tasty! It was also nice to get a real plate vs a Styrofoam box! 

808 is fairly reasonable for the amount of food you get, but definitely not as low priced or generous as other Hawaiian places I've been to around town. Garlic chicken and a soda was about 11 bucks. They seem to be very popular as well since people were coming in non-stop during the lunch hour, so come early or be prepared to wait in line! I would come back here again in the future since it's not too far from work."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm in love. The kalbi ribs are meaty and tender. Garlic chicken was flavorful and juicy. I got the 808 mix plate and it was enough for 2 people but I was greedy and devoured most of my plate. I'm so full and happy, we will come again. Customer service was excellent too !!"}
{"text":"WOW!  After reading all the reviews there are some real idiots out there when it comes to rating a food establishment.  this place sucks to high heaven.  Food is like crap and the portions are really small, I'm Hawaiian and like to eat like back home where home grown food is served-huge portions.  Yeah the pygmy behind the counter needs to go, she is the biggest little downfall for this place and gives the 808 a really bad tase and name.  I personally will never go back.  Hamburger steak taste like rubber meat, chicken taste like three day ole dead bird, and more.  Service really stinks - service without a smile - attitude."}
{"text":"Customer services is pure hawaiian style! Great services as always.  Food is UNO!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it is definitely one of the best Hawaiian BBQ restaurants in the area. The staff is friendly and always makes a fuss over how cute my toddler is. Can't say I blame them! I usually just get the regular BBQ chicken."}
{"text":"Tucked in between a soul food restaurant on the left and building protruding farther on the right, this place was not what I expected. The restaurant was small and felt very fast-casual. Between all the tables maybe forty people could fit? Luckily I went on a Monday night and it wasn't busy at all. It almost reminded me of an old Robertos. A

While ambiance is not their forte . . . but that food though!! I got the California Caterpipllar Roll which was a deep fried spam masubi with crab, spicy mayo, and ell sauce (if I rmemeber correctly.) YUM! I would come back just for this. It was so good."}
{"text":"This place is super good. I was born in Hawaii. You should trust my opinion. The food is the most authentic that I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"So i order from here frequently and so to write a bad review pisses me off more. I order the same thing every time. The Ahi salad. I order through uber eats because I work at a call center can can't leave. They forget the dressing which makes the entire salad. I call and the lady says \"I'll note that.\" Okay you noting something doesn't help me to eat a dry salad. She was ready to end the conversation. Like that's it. It will be noted. No honey I can't eat a 18 dollar salad. I need a little more then that. They blame uber and say they should have checked it. So it's not your responsibility to put it in the bag. Absolutely frustrating with the level of accountability. Then she says when I order again in the future they will make sure to give me extra dressing for the dressing that was missed. Perfect. So for my next 18 dollar salad I can have extra dressing. I'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"The poke is fire the deep fried spam masubui are out of this world. The ahi Katsura Roll was next level , and the garlic chicken was kill. Try tho place out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Owners friendly. -2 stars because they NEVER ever have spam musabi. Usually they say \"oh they run out fast\" one time I came in even earlier like 12pm they'd already run out. How do you have a Hawaiian place open and run out of that? Make more duh. It doesn't even take a lot of time. I'm sure this isn't an issue for most people because spam musabi is like a Hawaiian local thing (even gas stations sell it in Hawaii) but honestly it's like an American goes to McDonald's and theyre told they've run out of French fries for the day. 

WTF!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry I really love my musabis. It's the ultimate sidekick to their really good plate lunches. Too bad they never have it ......"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at 808 mixed place. The restaurant is very clean. All of the employees are great! The service was better than I expected. 

The fried musubi is AMAZING. The price was only $3.25 and it was quite filling. It is like a combination of a fried sushi roll and musubi. 

I also had the garlic chicken. It was delicious. It was not greasy at all. 

I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had the mixed plate combo with Ono chicken and garlic chicken. They call it the Ono chicken because when you run out you'll say \"oh no.\" The garlic chicken is also amazing"}
{"text":"After we stopped at Poke Express we got our lunch here. I've been living in Texas for the last 3 yrs and was craving some local Hawaiian cuisine. I ordered the fried saimin w/teri beef, hubs had the firecracker chicken, and kids had spam musubi. It was very satisfying and delicious. Glad we found this spot. Now I need to find some laulau & poi..."}
{"text":"This place is just like all the other Hawaiian spots in town.  The only thing that sets them apart is Uncle Willie's chicken special, and they hardly ever make it.  I understand it's a special, but I think they would get way more business if they made it a weekly thing.  I even heard many people asking for it last time I was there and were also disappointed it wasn't being served.  MAKE UNCLE WILLIE'S CHICKEN A REGULAR THING!

Edit: So after adding my 2 cents in on yelp, the people at 808 mixed plate actually listened!  they emailed me letting me know when their special uncle willy's chicken was going to be made.  We took the drive from Henderson (which was a lot better knowing they actually would have it) and had a delicious dinner.  It was so yummy, and I even heard more people order it while we were there (for a second, I thought I was the only one)  so thanks to the power of yelp, and the people at 808 hawaii mixed plate that take their reviews seriously!  I really appreciate it!  I can't wait to go"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place because we were on our way to poke express. We figure this would be the perfect combination since we were missing Hawaii. 

The restaurant itself could be nicer, but it looks like any other l&l. The prices were decent. $10 for a mixplate....not too bad considering they give u big portions. 

My husband had the combination kalua pig and cabbage & beef stew. He didnt care for the kalua pig and cabbage, because a lot of it was just cabbage. I had their version of a zip PAC from zippys in Hawaii. I actually liked it. It was really close for me. I almost felt like i was eating a zip PAC. 

decent prices, the food was good (in my opinion), and the portions were pretty big."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots to go eat!!! I really love the ono chicken and the hamburger steak!!!"}
{"text":"First time here thanks to Yelp, and I like it. The environment is nice and chill as well as the customer service. Food was delicious. Got the garlic chicken that everyone was raving about and it didn't disappoint. I would recommend it for a quick eat if you, like me, didn't feel like waiting at a loud packed restaurant."}
{"text":"We found us on yelp, and it is a fun Hawaiian style restaurant. The garlic chicken is great, short ribs are great and the macaroni salads great.  Is a fun place we recommend it."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try Hawaiian food after my awful experiences at L&L BBQ. At L&L, the meat is cheap and the dishes are so salty  -- GARBAGIO!

However, after reading reviews on 808 -we decided to give it a try. WOW-- this place is great! My family and I tried the following three dishes:

1. BBQ chicken plate (GOOD!)
2. BBQ beef plate, (GREAT!) and 
3. Korean spicy wings ( UNREAL!). 


All three plates came with white rice and a macaroni/potato salad combo. Both the chicken and beef plates were not fatty, and cooked just right. I have never seen my wife completely finish her plate before.......IMPRESSIVE!

My dish was the Korean wings which were crazy good. They wings were so meaty, and cooked to perfection. I chose the spicy version which were sweet with a little kick of chile. TIP--- Get an extra side of Korean sauce to dip your wings in......

**** This is a family-owned business and everyone is so nice. They made sure to check on us throughout our lunch, and were so pleasant to talk to. I can't say enough good things about this place-- I love it here. 

Our lunch came out to $24.00 for three lunches and 1 fountain drink. Please go to this restaurant, and support this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is popular.  I waited in line for 10 minutes before I ended up walking out.  The line was almost to the door!  I don't think it's worth waiting that long.  In those 10 minutes, the line NEVER moved and I overheard a patron that had already been served that she wouldn't come back because she didn't \"like this place\".  So I ended up @ Teriyaki Madness a few doors down."}
{"text":"This place will knock your rubbah slippah off! 

I'm a BIG eater so I ordered a little bit of everything. I ordered the saimin, loco moco, garlic chicken, Korean chicken, garlic Mahi Mahi, ahi tofu pattie thing, and sesame chicken. I promise it wasn't all for me. I brought my family.

1. The restaurant was very welcoming. You could feel the Aloha spirit when you walk in.

2. The food was priced right on the money

3. The restaurant was very clean 

4.  The wait time was normal considering my large order

5. My favorite part, the food:
garlic chicken with mayo miso sauce- the chicken was marinated and had the right amount of flavoring. The mayo miso took it to another level. Very local comfort food with a gourmet twist. 

Loco moco- I'm not big on loco moco's, but when I seen one coming out of the kitchen, it literally called my name. The hamburger patty was thick and juicy. The brown gravy was homemade. Rich and flavorful. It's definitely a home run.

Saimin- it had a light broth which I liked. The noodles had a nice al dente chew to it. Great side to a perfect meal.

Garlic Mahi- my husband ordered it and was raving about it. I was surprised cause he's not a big fish eater. 

Ahi tofu patty- my mom ordered it and absolutely loved it.

Korean chicken- my husband likes chicken but never eats the battering or skin. I was surprised to see him clean the chicken off the bone.

Sesame chicken- we brought that home for later. While we watched a movie at home we tore that plate up like it was a food eating contest. The chicken was marinated  perfectly. On the sweeter side with scoop of rice and mac salad. YUM! 

I was wanting some dessert but they had sold out earlier in the day. My mom and brother was telling me there cakes are fabulous. I guess I'll just have to take another drive out to the NW to see for myself. All for yelp sake of course. That's they only way I could give a true review. LOL :)

The only negative is they don't have a location in Henderson. :(

This place is a must!"}
{"text":"yummy and delicious hawaiian goodies. great for a spam musubi or a lunch plate. They even can make saimin to go for those cold chilly days when you just want some hot soup. Otherwise the korean bbq rib or loco moco plate is enough to make you food coma."}
{"text":"Somen salad was tasty and very filling.  The mixed plate also tasty and all meals will fill you up!  Great place to go!"}
{"text":"Oh my god this place is so good. Really, save yourself some money and skip all the $60 Vegas buffets. Just a comment on Vegas food besides buffets-- or at least for this place-- so much food for so cheap!

I agree with all the other reviews and want to recommend the garlic chicken. It's not really garlic-y. I can't really describe it, but it's more like a sweet and sour chicken with some tangy miso dressing. SUPER BOMB. Just get it. I've never had Hawaiian food in my life, but it definitely blends in with my familiar Asian food norm. 

The other entree I got was the chicken katsu. I was a bit hesitant at first because there were so many other exotic options. Personally, it was a great choice for me, since the others said that the loco moco was too salty, and since it wasn't traditional Japanese curry katsu, I still got to try something new. 

Sides-- pick rice and salad. The other combo is mac and potatoes. If you get that, everything would just be too heavy (in my opinion)."}
{"text":"808 is located up in North Las Vegas, at the corner of Craig and Revere. It's on the Southeast corner, in the same plaza as Big Lots and Poke Express. They claim to serve Hawaiian style food and it's the closest I've had here on the mainland, not counting my families cooking that is. 

When my mom and I walked in, the place was empty. Didn't bother me as we avoided a long wait for our food as my mom mentioned that during the rush hour, orders can take up to 30 minutes and longer. As we left, two big parties made their way in, so we were lucky in that regard. 

I opted for the Won Ton Saimin. My mom chose some fish plate. The noodles consistency was great and the broth was tasty. As for the won tons, the filling was a little on the stingy side and I felt the serving size was a little small for the price. However, overall, I liked it and I'll be back for more when I'm in the area and I'm hit with a craving. I didn't try my mom's dish so I won't comment on it other than to say she cleared her plate. Not much more need be said than that."}
{"text":"Took too long to review this place. I ordered to go some months ago: garlic chicken with miso mayo and loved every bit of it with white rice! I wasn't a fan of the macaroni salad though. There wasn't anything spectacular about it."}
{"text":"Very stoked that this restaurant is still here in north Las Vegas. I always come to 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate for their chicken katsu dish and for their spam musubi... It just reminds me of the deluxe spam musubi from 7-11 back home in Hawaii. I also love this restaurant for their Friday special and breakfast all day dishes too."}
{"text":"Amazing garlic chicken plate! I have been here a handful of times, and always get the same thing! Also have had the spam masubi, which is also very good."}
{"text":"I've gone to this spot for lunch twice now. Each time I ordered food to go, and left smiling. The staff is super friendly. It feels like you just walked into a Hawaiian family kitchen. 
By the time I got home, (less then 10 minutes) the food is perfect. Fried masubi is probably a sin somewhere, but I would recommend the risk. I've had the ago salad.  The tuna is beautifully rare, over an assortment of flavors and crisp greens. 
The mahi burger was a huge crispy and moist mahi steak with fresh veggies and some awesome tartar sauce. 
5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Maybe I got here on an off day but I'm not impressed being from Hawaii there is a certain expectation and this place didn't meet it.  The plates are more expensive then most \"Hawaiian\" quick stops but they give 2/3 of the amount.  The garlic chicken sample was super good but the rest of the food was average.  Portuguese breakfast eggs scrambled - eggs terrible flavorless and not cooked through. Fried spam musubi no one said there is a nasty mayo sauce on it or we wouldn't have ordered it ruined the whole thing.  Hula pack was pathetic my sons were still hungry rice well made noodles tasteless but the bbq chicken was good just too little.  The somen salad looked good but didn't have enough sauce and had not real ham but sandwich ham cut up in it.  Again not someplace I would come across town for as I live in Henderson but it was ok.  Oh the place is really clean and the workers were nice which is why they got 3 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place in Vegas for plate lunch.  The aunties there will make sure you are full."}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and tried out this local Hawaiian spot and it exceeded all my expectations! The food is great and the staff is friendly. 

I got a spicy poke bowl, fried spam musubi and a loco moco. They were all great but my favorite was the fried spam musubi. It was different and like a sushi roll. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I always come here and order the kalbi.  Awesome portions & amazing flavor."}
{"text":"The food here is super tasty, portions are generous, and the staff is very courteous! I've never been to Hawaii, and haven't really wanted to go, but eating here makes me want to go just for the food!"}
{"text":"I went to Hawaii for the first time a few months ago.  One of the best things about he trip was the amazing food.  Las Vegas is often called the 9th island because of the significant Hawaiian population here, which also comes with it an abundance of Hawaiian restaurants.  This place is the closest I have found to what I remember having in Hawaii!  The moco loco, katsu chicken, Kalua pork, and kalbi short ribs are all amazing!  Every time I am up in the neighborhood, I make sure to stop here for my fix!"}
{"text":"You'll have to be prepared to wait a good 20-30 minutes for your food to come. I would suggest you call in and make a phone order. The garlic Ahi (grilled) was dry, even though I requested pink inside. A little pricey, but I guess you have to pay Hawaiian prices in the 702."}
{"text":"Awesome homestyle island food! The musubi and mac salad was okay but the meat was so flavorful and juicy. Love this place and it was definitely worth the 25 min drive out lol Service was good overall vibe of the restaurant was casual and homey."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. My family and I drove all the way from the bay area because a friend of mine recommended we try this place. She raved about it. I was not impressed. Out of all the Hawaiian spots I've been to 808 seemed to have really small portions and I was still hungry after and it was pretty pricey. I will say this the Beef was tasty that's about it.. Will I come back? Probably not.

Aloha 808."}
{"text":"Had the kalua pork with cabbage plate with Mac for a side. The pork was VERY juicy. Nice taste. I would have no problem eating here again. For those that care. The men's restroom was very clean."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to spots on Friday's or any other day I don't feel like cooking. We have order just about everything on the meun and our favorites are the garlic chicken and spicy poke. The service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"So much food!! I loved this place very much. I had ordered the famous garlic chicken and spare ribs mix plate with rice and macaroni salad. I was not a big fan of the mac salad only because of the potatoes and am used to L & L's version (mmmm). Also the spare ribs were a little tougher than expected, but everything else was very tasty! Next time I will definitely share a plate, the servings are more than enough for one person. Will stop by again when I get the chance."}
{"text":"The food here is ALWAYS good, and it doesn't hurt that it's very close to my house. My favorites include the kalbi short ribs, garlic chicken, and their somen salad. I'm constantly ordering their garlic chicken bowl, check it out people! Their kalbi is so flavorful but it's little on the pricey side right now, so I only get it every now and then. And I love their somen salad for when I'm craving something on the colder, refreshing side :)"}
{"text":"I always go in at least once a week. The food is great and the boneless Kolbi is my favorite dish. The workers here are always helpful and try their hardest. They also have great shirts, I bought one for myself. Definitely authentic Hawaiian barbecue. LnL got nothing on 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate."}
{"text":"Love this place! Garlic chicken, the poke, butter Michi and cone sushi are like my absolute favorites here! It's a bit of a drive for me but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian BBQ in North Las Vegas. Their garlic chicken and short ribs  are incredible."}
{"text":"After eating here several times I am finally getting around to this review. Why, you might ask? I dont know why either. Maybe its because I am so full and satisfied after each visit that I just got too relaxed which equals to laziness on my part. Well I feel that I need to do this now so all you peeps out there looking for a decent Hawaiian place to eat can get the info you need. First of all, they are closed on mondays.  To help you find this place easier, look for the nicely sized Big Lots sign in the same complex. Since the building itself is kind of back a ways, their sign looks dinky from the street. They are to the right of Ella Em's Soul Food which I kind of dont recommend eating at. Refer to my review on them and you will know what I mean.

Since my first visit here I kept telling myself that I will try other dishes but always end up getting the same items. Mainly Kalbi Short Ribs, Garlic Chicken, and Grilled Mahi Mahi accompanied by a rotation of the Mac Salad and Green Salad.

First and foremost, if you are coming here for the first time, get the Kalbi Short Ribs! It is nothing like what you have had at other places. It's literally a bone in steak because the cut they give you is like about 4 actual short ribs stacked on top of each other but cut up into strips for you enjoy it much easier than having to manually pull the meat apart or cut it. If you dont believe me, please refer to the numerous mouth watering pics and mine will be there as well! I recommend you order it medium rare for best taste and tenderness. Also give them a little more time to cook it especially if the place is packed.

For you garlic lovers like me, the Garlic Chicken is what always gets me kind of like how that one really cute nephew or niece of yours that you just cant say no to when they tilt their head and give you the puppy dog eyes look. Its basically chicken katsu cut up but with a different version of breading with a garlic mayo type of sauce on it.

The grilled Mahi Mahi always hits the spot for me when it comes to my fish craving. Its tender flakiness falls apart oh so easily with your fork. Only thing that may have caught my attention is that the portion was just a tad small. 

These three items I get are part of the their name sake combo, the 808 Mixed Plate in which you choose two items accompanied with two scoops of steamed white rice and your choice of mac salad or green salad. Im glad I dont come here alone and bring my family instead so I can sample all the goodness! 

The total price for all three large orders plus 2 drinks came to about 31 bucks and change. FYI, most orders you can get a mini or large depending on your appetite. The 808 mixed plates are guaranteed to be large sizes. So I would say an average meal here would be around 10 bucks a person. Not bad at all for really good food and good service.

Speaking of service, they take your order at the counter, you pay, sit down,  and they bring it out to you once its done. The drinks are self serve so you dont have to wait for them to refill your drinks. Once you are done eating, try to at least clean up a bit after yourself so that they dont spend too much time cleaning after you and for Pete's sake, leave a decent tip if you havnt already when you paid up front.

Next time I will try to order other stuff but no promises. Also dont forget to check out Poke Express down a few suites for some excellent Poke and yes, I have a review for that place too! So what are you waiting for? Stop reading this while driving and go straight there. Then you can send me a compliment after reading this. Lol. Enjoy!

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #105 \"Da Kine!\""}
{"text":"Their garlic chicken is AMAZING!!! We always get the 808 mixed combo plate with garlic chicken and spare ribs. I have not tried anything there that I didnt like. The staff is super nice and asked us if we had ever been there before the first time we went, when he said no they gave us a free sample of the garlic chicken. The spam masubi is good too; I dont know why it cost so much for one piece though, spam masubi is cheap to make. Regardless this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"We just moved to LV last week & already missing the aloha spirit and food. Checked out YELP in hopes of finding a Hawaiian restaurant and came across 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate. Another Yelper reviewed the fire cracker chicken so I decided to try. It was so good; not your ordinary fried chicken drizzled with a mayo/sriracha sauce. Ono-licious  My hubby opted for the garlic chicken, which was good too. 
So, If you're looking for some out of this world Hawaiian food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I've been to 808 so many times I can't even keep track, but lately it's not really been worth it.  The place has a different vibe to it, not that it was super friendly before...but now it's worse.  I don't really recognize anyone.  The food is kinda the same, but the chicken seems very tough lately. I wanted the pork last time, but they were out so I got chicken.  This time I got chicken too.  I don't know if I am unlucky but both times I got something very hard, maybe a piece of bone?  My jaw even hurts.  I'm not wanting to speculate too much on what it was.  I also miss the specials.  I know they still have them, but they are the same every week.  Nothing \"special\".  I probably won't be back so much anymore, the prices and food don't really make it worth it.  :/"}
{"text":"I had ordered The garlic chicken. I enjoyed it. It has this miso mayo that was really a good flavor added to the chicken. You can defiantly taste the garlic on the chicken but it wasn't over powering. It came with Mac salad which tasted like it was made couple days ago. I'm a Mac Salad fan and it really didn't taste that good. I think I should have ordered size Mini instead of regular because it is a large portion meal which is good.

The beau got the Loco Moco. The patty was made fresh and didn't taste like it came out of a freezer which he really liked. He did mention he wanted his eggs sunny side but he's egg came out over easy & yolk was cooked all the way. But other than that he enjoyed the food.

Honestly probably won't be returning. Nothing really wrong with the food. It's just nothing really stood out to me for me to return."}
{"text":"I am writing my review after my second visit.  Lets just say I spent $17 on take out and a soda and felt like it was a complete waste. I ordered the combination plate with shoyu chicken and Kalbi. It came with rice and macaroni salad.  The chicken was so dry like it had been stewing all day long. The Kalbi was thick cut (ordered the thin cut). It was fatty and chewy though tasted ok. The macaroni salad was soggy and sour. I ended up throwing it out. Needless to say I'll not be returning. I don't get the high reviews. 

They weren't friendly (not rude either). The dining room was grimy. I wondered how clean the kitchen was. 

If you think your gonna get the kind of plate lunch you'd get at L&L, it's not even close. I went to Juns the next day and got their combination and it was cheaper and tasted better."}
{"text":"Our favorite Hawaiian restaurant. Family run, food is always fantastic. They treat you like family. Prices have increased over the years but we still keep coming back to this joint. Worth the drive if you're not from the area."}
{"text":"Found this place by divine intervention!  First  sign of this being a good place, walked in and the place was slammed!  Second, menu had all the comforts of my island palate!  Third, the food was delicious and passed the Keiki test!  HI BBQ beef & chicken, Katsu, Teri beef burger and I mean Teri beef, not ground beef.  So good the old man had to order a second.  And the hurricane fries oh yeah!"}
{"text":"I rolled into Las Vegas on Tuesday.  I had three days and a hundred and eighty-five bookmarks.  It was time to get busy.

I was hungry AF, and I wanted to try somewhere new.  808 Mixed plate was at the top of my list. What a great discovery!

Stepping up to the counter, I told the counterperson it was my first visit.  Then it got a little weird.  Without saying a word to me, she turned around a told the kitchen \"Give me a garlic!\"

Someone's To Go order had just come up and she grabbed it and started packing it up.  Meanwhile I'm standing there, a little confused.  Another counterperson was nearby and I tried to ask him a question.  He totally didn't hear me.  So I'm standing there for like a solid minute or two while everyone behind the counter is doing their behind the counter duties.

I've read about a million reviews that describe something similar.  Usually the customer just gives up  and leaves.  Then they go home and writes a scathing review of the customer service.   

But that would've been a douche move.  Super douchey.  I would've missed out on a really great meal.

Barely two minutes had passed when Joy, the counterperson, turned around and offered me a little sample cup.  \"This is our Garlic Chicken,\" she explained, \"this is what we're known for.\"

Garlic Chicken?  Who the hell wants Garlic Chicken?  I didn't come for Garlic Chicken.  I'm all about Katsu Chicken.  I don't even want to try Garlic Chicken.

But Joy is super cute, and like most men, I'll do just about anything for a smile from a cute girl.  So, I politely try the Garlic Chicken.

Holy hell, that sh$t is good!  \"Wow!,\" I exclaimed.  Joy laughed at my reaction.  \"It's kind of like I punched you in the face, isn't it?,\" asked Joy,  \"No kidding,\" I replied.   I couldn't believe how good that garlic sauce was.  Joy explained about how it was made, something about garlic and mayo and something.  I can't remember exactly because talking to cute girls gives me amnesia.  And I had just recently been, like, punched in the face.

So, you know, I was on a mission to score some Katsu, and I needed to follow through.  But at the same time, I needed more of that creamy garlic sauce.  I asked about  getting a half katsu and half garlic chicken.  Joy said, no problem, you can get a half and half.

Now, if you are a dumb ass like me, you might think you're going to get a regular-sized order of food with half katsu and half garlic chicken.  But if you've been around the block, you know that a combo at a Hawaiian food place means two full orders of whatever it is you pick.  So when I pick up my food my eyes just about bug out of my head.  Dang, that's a huge pile of chicken!

You know how a dog's leg starts to shake when you pet it just right?  If there was a camera on me in that restaurant when I was there, I'm pretty sure the video will show some serious shaking.  

The Katsu and Garlic chicken are prepared a little differently than at other Hawaiian places I've visited.  The chicken isn't pounded flat.  The pieces more closely resemble actual pieces of chicken rather than flattened cutlets, or whatever.  The chicken isn't at all dry, like Katsu sometimes can be.  It's moist as a prom date and every bit as delicious.

The mac salad was atrocious.  I could only eat one bite.  The rice wasn't much better.  That's all I'm going to say about that.

They have a self serve Coca Cola machine, but no Mr. Pibb.  They have styrofoam cups, and I love me some styrofoam cups.  

I will definitely be back for more of that crazy good Garlic Chicken.  Thanks for turning me on to it, Joy!

Mikey C says: 808, baby!"}
{"text":"Unless you're eating at Roy's or something, this will probably be one of the most expensive hawaiian mixed plates you'll purchase in life, but I think it's worth a try. I don't find myself in North Las Vegas very often, so my husband and I decided to go big with our orders. He got the market price kalbi and I did the market price mahi mahi. Both were cooked very well and to our specifications. You still get a very large portion of rice and mac salad. The servers were very sweet and were very helpful in helping me narrow down my order. The mahi mahi leftovers I took home were still good the next day and didn't have that offensive fish odor, so I could tell the fish they use is very high quality. It also came with a soy wasabi sauce that gave the fish that extra kick. The kalbi had the most delicious char which I even enjoyed, and I'm not a bit steak-eater at all. I had to remind myself of the food a bit while writing this review and currently salivating at the other menu offerings, so I do hope to return one day! Reminded me a bit of Helena's on Oahu, which I've really missed."}
{"text":"The BBQ beef was way too thin & over cooked to the point of dry not tasty jerky, the sesame chicken was super dry as well. My garlic chicken was okay although I specifically asked for the miso-mayo sauce on the side & it was spread on top, since the food took forever I did not want to wait for another 30 minutes just for them to make more dry ass  sesame chicken just to pretend it's garlic chicken with some fat gross mayo sauce on it. The spam musubi was eh... nothing to get your panties in a bunch for but the haupia dessert was absolutely divine... best I've ever had. Seriously my fellow Hawaiian ohana? This is what you consider da best on da 9th island? Ono?....More like oh no."}
{"text":"fabulous fabulous fabulous..oh did i mention fabulous!? mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm they said my review was to short doesn't fabulous say it all???!!!?"}
{"text":"Brah, this place make some ONO kine dessert!    After some broke da mouth kine killa Misuken style fried chicken, I was kicking it with a opu that was nearly full to the max,   The Misuken style chicken was perfect, because it was crispy, but had one of the lightest batters that complimented a sauce what would have made anybody want a second serving....if you still have the room.

One thing for sure, since I live so far away from 808,  I never make it to 808 early enough to get some of their kick butt desserts, because they sellout within an hour on a few of them.   So I became a fan of this business on Facebook to see what kine specials come out, and I always see some mouth watering creations that spread out on their page.

On this day, I got more than my wish, and they broke out a custard pie that evening which just finished solidifying.    OH BRAH, that pie was better than Honolulu's Lee's Bakery and Sweet Revenge custard pie combine.    The crust was perfect, and was still flaky and light!   The custard was firm, and had a great  fresh egg taste.   I thought, 168 market put together a great egg tart, but 808's pie hit a grand slam with this pie!    I hope, I'm lucky enough to catch this again."}
{"text":"By far this is the go to spot for hawaiian food the gralic chicken is of the chain
Located up in north las vegas off mlk and craig next to big lots its worth the drive from across town"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to eat here. Food is delish, like others have mentioned. I had the Furikake Chicken and hubby had the Bento B plate. Both tasty and tender."}
{"text":"This place is really good the reason for my stars is because they are always closed before the time that's posted on there door.  Went there 3 times for them to be closed at 8 so today I decided to call so I wouldn't waste my time and gas again and she said they close at 9 and last call is at 8:45pm so I made sure to leave right away I got there at 8:10pm and they were closed the food is good but it's not worth having to deal with there horrible service/time management."}
{"text":"Classic Hawaiian in vegas, I would go back for sure.  Loved the Loco Moco and the food was very good.  Vibe is hippy dippy, and the booths in the restaurant make you feel like you are in an old mcdonalds or something strange, but the place packs em in, I cannot wait to go back , and also, in the same parking lot is the best little hawaiian poke shop in vegas, have lunch then get some pokey to go....mmmmm mmmm  4 star goodness!  Satisfying your taste for the islands...."}
{"text":"It was a nice treat to find this hole in the wall restaurant!  I yelped for a place close to me because a friend passed by and did not want to go far. I actually found a different Hawaiian place not realizing it did not have any seating.  The young man at that first place recommended if we wanted Hawaiian there was a place a few doors down. We were so glad it turned out to be excellent food and service.  I ordered a combo plate, with Mahi Mahi(I choose grilled vs. fried) and garlic  chicken.  I choose the garlic chicken because the young lady taking our order said it was their most popular dish.  I did not realize it was fried until I got plate. I typically dislike fried food but this was done well so I was not disappointed.  The Mahi Mahi was excellent and fresh!  I got a salad and it was good, the only complaint I have is that they were heavy on the sesame oil. Their sauces were very tasty.  I thought the prices were high but the portions were well worth it. I also do not like ordering at a counter and then having a seat, too bad they do not have waiter service.  I would return though."}
{"text":"I got the garlic chicken and kalbi ...they both had great taste the bad thing was my kalbi was all fat :( mac salad was blah this was take out next time we will try dine in"}
{"text":"3.5 Good eats, but Island Flavor is still my #1 and only in LV! Okay, for when you can't drive down to that part of town, this is a good alternative to get your 808 fix in. Poke Express is also a few doors down if you want something lighter.

Lots of island kine eating here, so you know there's gotta be something legit about it. Lots of options from beef stew ranging to classics like katsu and kalbi.

Their take on things is different than Island Flavor, so worth a shot to see how people do things differently. (I'm incredibly partial to Island Flavor's Furikake chicken, though. Here it is dark meat fried and then cut into strips.)

Prices are decent, but ordering a combo plate with short ribs will set you back $16 or $17! Big portions, but I can still find tastier, better quality for less down on Durango Drive."}
{"text":"D E L I C I O U S. I had the garlic chicken and the pulled pork! The food was well worth the drive and money. I also had the hurricane fries. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I Love This Place.Their Fried Spam Musubi Is A Must! 808 Is Military Friendly And Gets A Little Packed During Lunch Time. Its  A Good Idea To Call Ahead And Order Your Food Because It Does Take Awhile To Cook. 

-You Must Get The Garlic Chicken!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, fresh to order food, clean, good size portions... Overall, a great small Hawaiian restaurant! Our favorite is the garlic chicken plate. Must go and check it out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I go to Oahu every year and I am pretty sure the mac salad at 808 is better than Rainbow drive in Mac salad. The chicken katsu, BBQ chicken and short ribs were super tasty too!"}
{"text":"I love the Kalbi and Garlic Chicken plate, my complaint is that it is more on the expensive side so we don't come here very often and there aren't enough seats in the very small restaurant to eat during the lunch or dinner rush so we end up having our food made to go. Sometimes the people working seem kinda irritated  & on those days it's probably best to take the food to go or turn around and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to make 808 are main spot for our weekly lunch dates. So we've been there at least 10 times. However, today was one of those days were we needed to relax and enjoy each other's company and food. Nope,my Kalibi ribs were hard to chew and the Ono chicken was so very hard to bite. I was told by the waitress that her boss (owner) said I should've told them before I picked at it and they would've replaced my meal. But, it's too late. The waitress also informed me that she's been getting complaints from other customers as well. Oh okay, you've just lost a customer. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food in Vegas!!! Though it can be a wait to get your food, it is soooo worth it. I used to love L&L but this place really is better. If you are ever in the North Las Vegas area... take a detour and come here. I always do :)."}
{"text":"This place is BigTyme! If you one local or like local food then this da place to come! Garlic chicken is a must as well as the whole menu! They got much Aloha!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I have been craving the garlic chicken all week. It was so good, I need to tell everyone that I know that they have to go and eat some of the garlic chicken that changed my life.
Ok, not really changed my life, but made me sad that I don't live closer to enjoy the yummy dishes that are offered at this friendly shop. 
I ordered the $5 Bento: rice, couple pieces of kim chee, spam and garlic chicken. Crispy, juicy, salty and sweet. Oh my, what a combination. It was the perfect size for my smaller appetite ( I also needed to save room for gelato).
My husband had a bigger plate that included ahi, chicken, rice, fried saimin and spam. He ate all of his food-cleaned his plate! 
I am picky about my rice, I like it cooked a certain way, I call it fatsy... super sticky without being mushy. If a place serves rice that is no where near my fatsy scale, it is immediately on my SL. This place serves rice that is perfect. I could have just eaten rice and been happy. 
While we were eating, a lady came by to talk to us about our food. I love service like this, it lets the customer know that the people that are serving the food really want to know if you enjoy what you are eating and makes you feel like you are more than just a customer. It sends a message to the patron that the business cares.

Enjoy, the garlic chicken!"}
{"text":"I've been here too many times to count. It's excellent. I recommend it to everyone who's asking where to go for lunch.

My favorite is the firecracker or garlic chicken. Getting a mixed plate of that is perfect. The loco moco is fantastic too.

If I had to find something wrong, it would be they're not open enough. I always find myself pulling in to late after they've closed. Like, I know they need to sleep, but why can't I get my amazing cheat food at 3 am?"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is incredible and the customer service is awesome.  The mom there knows my favorites by heart and I believe she takes pleasure in feeding me lol.  She reminds me of my mom always bringing me food with a smile on her face.  I hope it's not rude that I don't know her name.  They don't wear name tags.  Everyone is super cool though."}
{"text":"We just moved to this side of town and we are already addicted. They garlic chicken is on fire! It's only 10 bucks you get the chicken your rice and chose of mac salad or tossed salad. As of right now we have been coming all week --- super duper good ......... must try!"}
{"text":"The staff are always friendly. I always order for pick up. Fast service and the food is always delicious. Kalbi ribs are Mmmm Mmmm good."}
{"text":"I don't know how I feel about this place, because I love that it's a mom & pop kind of spot. The service was very nice. However, for the price & quality of food... I definitely could've made this stuff at home. It didn't have much flavor in my opinion. 

I'll have to go back& try it again, maybe it was the dish I ordered, not the food. But my husband and I felt the same way about it & we ordered different things. 

So not sure if I'll be back anytime soon. 
Pricey and dull flavor. But I want to support their local business. 
This was a tough one"}
{"text":"One of my top 5 favorite places to eat in town ! I don't even want to tell you how ONO  \"delicious\"  the Korean style chicken wings are! My fave grinds! But really anything anytime I've ordered it's all good! The owners and employees are all  so awesome chill! Aloha loa nui!"}
{"text":"Ok if anyone's seen my other reviews for places I don't give a 5 star lightly. I take into account price, quality, and quantity. We accidentally stumbled into this place because poke express was closed. It was fate intervening and wanting us to try this little piece of Hawaii in Vegas. I had the mixed plate with Kalbi and garlic chicken. My husband had the moco loco and katsu chicken...we also got a taste of the Uncle Willy's katsu and cream puff made of Okinawa potato and chantilly cream...my mouth is watering again just talking about it. The Kalbi wasn't the usual thin piece of meat...the meat was thick, juicy, and I had more meat than rice to eat with!  The uncle willys katsu was crispy and a little bit honey. My friends bought two servings to go it was so delish! I know this is going to sound insane...but their food is better than any Hawaiian food I had in Hawaii...ok minus the macademian pancake and garlic shrimp food truck. I'm so happy that I don't have to fly 12 hours to Hawaii to get good Hawaiian food! It's now only 6 hours away and here in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"I'm not one to right a bad review because they are subjective. But...

I'm no restaurant expert but the so called service was completely terrible. It was my first and last time here and ONLY because it was close to my home. I usually go to Aloha Kitchen for Hawaiian food. 

When asking about menu items I was given an attitude as if was supposed to know what it was. Eventually after getting a short answer I just agreed and ordered the Kau Kau \"pack\" with seared ahi because they were out of salmon and bbq chicken. 

The ahi was good, saimin was probably sitting all day, the chicken was dry and half burnt. My musubis were brought and placed on the table which had not been wiped down I know this because the stains were still there it, note that it's was the cleanest table I could find.

After spending over $40 including a generous tip I left very unsatisfied with the service. I honestly expected more since it had a mom and pop feel and great reviews... Later 808."}
{"text":"Omg so many items on their menu. I wished that I could order everything.   Breakfast is served all day  

Okinawiian sweet potato coco puff in the fridge by the sodas. Mmmmm I wished I wasn't doing errands all day or else I would of gotten some. 

So many choices that I couldn't decide what to get the fried saimin with garlic chicken because a lot of the reviews said it was the best. Boy am I glad I did. It was sooooo good. Reminded me of home. The portion was huge and I hardly made a dent in it. The garlic chicken had some kind of garlic mayo over it. I think next time I may ask for it on the side. The chicken was very flavorable. The fried saimin was so ono. 

I will definitely be back and want to try the garlic ahi."}
{"text":"I've never actually been to the restaurant but I've order delivery from this place about 5 times so far, and I have to say, I like this place better than a few other popular known Hawaiian themed restaurants in the Las Vegas area.

I actually love the different bentos, my go to bento would be the 808. Spam, bbq chicken, teriyaki beef, fried salmon and rice. I usually order a side of Kim chee and mac/potato salad as well. 

For a quick lunch while your working, this is definitely a fave of mines

The ultimate is the Kalbi short ribs plate. It's $16.00 but it comes with rice and a side salad, but the Kalbi is cut so thick, you're going to love this plate! Especially if you're like me and have a Hawaiian sized stomach!

Today, I ordered the garlic chicken combo plate with bbq chicken - WOW!

The garlic chicken sort of reminds me of mochiko chicken with a nice garlic aioli.

Folks, if you love Hawaiian BBQ, you can't go wrong with this place. The food is yummy and the portions are just right.

Check out the food, order take out or delivery and enjoy some good Hawaiian style bbq!

:)"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious ! Me and my husband went for the first time about 2 days ago, we never seem to agree on food and this place definitely had us both agreeing. We both thought their food was on point super fresh and the flavors were amazing. I'm not to educated on this type of food and the lady behind the counter that was taking the order had a lot of patience with me, which I appreciate a ton! I had the furkaki ahi plate?  I know i must have misspelled it but it was seard Ahi with a tasty sauce drizzled ontop. 5 stars for the food! The atmosphere could use a lil work though.  Ill definitely be returning"}
{"text":"One of my favorites and best tasting but the portions seem to keep getting smaller and smaller.... it's not like it use to be."}
{"text":"They opened around 11:05. We were the first customers for the day and the moment we came in no one greeted us or even smiled as we came in. There were two ladies upfront and no one even bothered to ask whether we were ready or needed help. Even after we greeted them good morning, the lady at the cashier just stared at me and did not even respond with a smile. I would probably understand if it's the end of the day and they are already tired but... The same thing happened to the customer after us..... 

Anyway for the food we ordered the loco moco and kuakua plate (?) 

The loco moco gravy was bland and watery. It was lacking so much flavor which is essential to the loco moco experience. :( the patties were so much thicker than the traditional loco moco and kind of dry. :( I have travelled to hawaii and had hawaiian food all over southern california and sad to say I never had a bad experience with hawaiian food like this. 

The macaroni salad was alright. I usually finish two cups of those but this time the most I could have was 2 spoonfuls of it. :( 

I have not tried their whole menu because they might have some specialties that could taste great but sadly I am never coming back.... $30 for 2 people was too much for that quality :("}
{"text":"Came in looked the menu over for an \"In-between Church Services Meal\". No idea what I wanted. The beautiful cashier suggested the Garlic Chicken they were known for. After several questions she got me a sample. The sauce was FIRE in a good way and the Miso Mayo was sweet. After ordering and picking grilled instead of Fried chicken with the sauce from the Garlic Chicken on the side, I realized I literally had 3 servings of Chicken Teriyaki with brown rice at home and JUST left a place because I didn't want to spend $10 for the same thing I had at home. I apologized and asked her to cancel the order.  She did so kindly and encouraged me to come back. 4 stars for EXCELLENT customer service. Hoping to add the 5th star when I finally try the food one day."}
{"text":"Always super delicious but then I always get the same thing~ 808 mixed plate with kalbi (shortribs, med-rare~) and garlic chicken. There's also enough food to where I always have enough for a second meal.

Have tried other Hawaiian places in the North Las Vegas area and they just don't compare~"}
{"text":"This is just an abbreviated review since we came here because we were squatting their tables and we were referred by Poke Express a couple of doors down.  We didn't want to be completely jerky about it so we ordered a couple of Spam Musubis http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/808-hawaii-mixed-plate-north-las-vegas?select=iGmvCpBb7NpMCPh4ILBcyw#iGmvCpBb7NpMCPh4ILBcyw and a Somen Salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/808-hawaii-mixed-plate-north-las-vegas?select=iGmvCpBb7NpMCPh4ILBcyw#R-2jbUYQ6EjnDKAIe0LMFQ to go along with our spoils that we brought from PE...

The girls had the salad mostly and they said it was alright.  The Spam Musubi were fine.  I honestly don't know because I didn't actually try anything else but I've been to Aloha Specialties and this place seems to rate favorably...

Nice to know that they're good neighbors with Poke Express..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the chicken dishes, especially the Ono chicken. Really crispy! They have some local specials like Loco Moco, etc, and was told that they sell out pretty fast.  Macaroni salad is solid, and enjoyed the kahlua pork and Garlic chicken too.

It's nice that they participate in Restaurant.com coupons."}
{"text":"Been here quite a number of times and ordered the mixed BBQ plate. Ive tried their garlic chicken, galbi ribs, furikake chicken, firecracker chicken, ahi poke, and chicken katsu. All were great!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after some last minute Halloween shopping at a nearby party store. From what I can see from their menu, this is not your typical hawaiian BBQ place with all the same typical plates and combos. This one had a bunch of stuff I've never heard of and it took me a while to figure out what I was going to order.

I didn't wanna ask questions because they'd probably look at me weird for not knowing what a certain item was (people think I'm islander all the time). So I played it cool and ordered something called a pack? But they ran out of packs for the day so they subbed the noodles for rice and macaroni salad instead.

Let me tell you, the 3 mile drive home from that place felt like the longest drive of my life! After taking a peek and a whiff of my box at the first stop sign, I couldn't wait to get home and tear this thing up. And it was good. I had BBQ beef and chicken katsu and both were delicious. Their food has that home cooked touch to it that you don't get at the other Hawaiian BBQ places. I'm really glad I went with them when I decided to cheat on my diet. Can't wait to try the other dishes that my fellow yelpers recommend on my next cheat day...which will probably be tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is my new Hawaiian spot!

all the reviews mentioned the garlic chicken and man it was delicious! i added noodles and wow it had bacon in it! amazing noodles, bbq chicken is great. the bbq beef should be sliced.

i will be back for sure!

also regarding customer service i told them this was my first time and asked many questions. they answered them all without any attitude."}
{"text":"During a whirlwind trip to Vegas recently, my friend, a Vegas local, took me to this spot.  It's very synonymous with L&L in California, both in name and theme.

The fast food restaurant was very ordinary and what you'd expect.  Simple bench seats, a front counter and a kitchen area.  No frills at all.

The employee working here lacked any sort of personality, to the point of appearing offended that we were in her business ordering. Later on, she warmed up, but it was an odd feeling like she hadn't really ever dealt with more than 1 person at a  time, ever.

**FOOD!**

The food was tasty.  Chicken and beef plates, but unlike Cali, none include the Kalbi Ribs, as everywhere else does.  I asked if they had these, they said yes, but it was a large amount of $$ more, and an extra 15 minute wait, so I declined.  

Overall, if I'm visiting Vegas, I'll probably stick to the tastiness on The Strip and eat this type of food in Cali."}
{"text":"The Kalbi (short ribs) were awesome... Their sweet potato pancake was delicious. The BBQ beef, not so exciting. Was sort of dry and tough to chew. Otherwise this is a cool little Hawaiian restaurant in Vegas. Would come again for breakfast or short ribs."}
{"text":"The best local food I have had in Vegas so far.  The quality of the food and the preparation is outstanding.  I have been there 3 times in the past month and everything I have tried was unbelievably tasty.  It is a good thing that this restaurant is way up north or else I would be there way too often and eating my weight in garlic chicken.

The first dish I had was the garlic chicken.  This dish is a must try.  Juicy and flavorful breaded chicken with miso mayo right on top.  So delish.  The chicken is similar to Mochiko chicken with the sweet teriyaki flavor in the breading.

The Shoyu chicken was good as well.  Extremely large portion with 4 chicken thighs soaking in the sweet sauce.  Reminded me of Rainbow Drive In on Oahu.  

I most recently ordered the Mahi Mahi plate lunch from their specials menu.  It is usually sold out so I had to order it when I saw it.  The fish is lightly breaded and you get the choice of garlic sauce or furikake crusted.  The furikake style was delicious and I really want to try the garlic sauce.  I think the garlic sauce is the more popular option.

I tried some of the beef teriyaki and that was prepared well too.  Thin strips of beef marinated with teriyaki sauce and barbecued to perfection.  

Everyone that works here is so nice.  It is run by a family and the daughter always mans the counter while her older brother cooks in the back with their mom and dad.  I believe that there are aunties and other relatives that cook as well.  Very cute!

I realized 3 visits in that they offer military discount!  10% off would have saved me some money.  At least now I know.  I guess my biceps weren't big enough for her to ask if I was military.  Gotta hit the gym.

PS. I like to hit up Poke Express in the same plaza to eat some delicious ahi or salmon poke with my meal.  Makes it official... best meal ever."}
{"text":"I am not sure how this restaurant got 4/5 stars. I rarely post on yelp but after eating here, i felt i had an obligation to write an honest and truthful review. We ordered the 808 plate and the saimin noodles. Imagine eating top ramen with salty broth with pcs of an omelet. They were supposed to put pork but the lady said they didnt have any and placed cheap tasting ham bits. The first bite on that chicken was horrible. Half cooked and cold drizzled with \"sauce\". And the ribs, :( be careful everyone."}
{"text":"Don't know what all the fuss is about!! I've been in this town for over 20++years. I've seen plate lunch places come and go. 808 has the best flavors hands down to any other plate lunch place in the 702 area. I've never ordered anything that I've been disappointed in. My only problem is that they are 20+minutes away from my house. I especially love their kalbi (pricey but totally worth it), chicken katsu, and garlic chicken. Try it if you are new...you will be happy you did"}
{"text":"First time here.  I wasn't sure what to get.  Sure, I'm from the islands but I don't have that one particular go to comfort food.  I asked the waitress what she recommended and she suggested the Garlic Chicken so I went with it.  I thought it was really good.  The chicken was full of flavor and moist.  It had some kind of sauce drizzled on top which added to the goodness of the meal.  It was good. I'd order that again! 

So with that being said, Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"Great homemade dishes.  Our garlic chicken and firecracker chicken were amazing!  Too bad they were out of the kalbi."}
{"text":"Bomb Diggity!!! The staff was friendly and even gave us garlic chicken to try and it was soooo Yummy!!! Thanks 808 HMP Team! You guys are awesome!!! Garlic Chicken/Kalbi plate was really good! Deep Fried Spam Musubi is also yummy!!!"}
{"text":"taste like home! I had the garlic chicken and it was fanatic! my son did the combo with Loco moco and futikaki chicken and we both shared fried saimin! Everything was great! #hawaiiangrinds"}
{"text":"Had high hopes.   Asked for poke, none today.  OK, let's go with chicken.  Oops, everything except for teriyaki was deep fried.  Teriyaki was OK, but not exactly Hawaii.  More like KFC than mixed plate."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food I've eaten in Vegas. Reminds me of being back on the islands.  Good portions, amazing flavors. Definitely will be back, this will be the only place I come to get Hawaiian food from now on for sure."}
{"text":"Enjoy something different, Hawaiian food was right down the road. Did take out and was glade to find this, spare ribs and garlic chicken along with white rice.  This place will be on my list of possible weekend stops."}
{"text":"I ordered the furikake chicken and teriyaki chicken combination. I was super disappointed with the furikake chicken. It was just chicken katsu with some seaweed sesame seed sprinkled on it. I was hoping something more crunchy like what they serve at Island Flavor. I was hoping this could be my new hawaiian place since it's a lot closer to home, but oh wells."}
{"text":"After Earl and I volunteered at Three Square, we were hungry.  Since we are barely in the North side of town, we decided to try out an eatery that we cannot visit often in Henderson.  We decided on 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate.

When we arrived, there was a group of guys in front of us.  Their orders came out and majority got the garlic chicken.  In addition, the portion looked huge.  Earl and I decided on the 2 meat combo.  We got the Kahlua pork and cabbage, as well as the garlic chicken.  It came with a scoop of rice and choice of mac salad or green salad.  We opted for the green salad.  The food came out after 10 minutes.  The Kahlua pork and cabbage was very tasty.  Just the right about of seasoning.  The garlic chicken was super flavorful.  It was crispy, sweet, and a bit spicy.  The mayo aioli was a great addition to this chicken.  The green salad had some brown, due to the old lettuce.  Was not very fresh.

Overall, the food was good and cheap.  One plate was more than enough for both Earl and I.  We will visit when we are back to volunteering at Three Square."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong. Good flavor. Good portion. Good pricing.
Just sucks that its soooo far."}
{"text":"My family and I came to this Hawaiian eatery for lunch. We ordered Musubi Spam,Korean chicken wings,Kalua roast pork,Furikake Mahi Mahi, & Sautéed Shrimp. I must say all of these were amazingly good. It is a very casual place, you order your food on the counter and the waitress will bring the food to your table.Only my second time eating Hawaiian food and I know it's going to be one of my regular place to dine."}
{"text":"The chef here is amazing. Try one of his fish dishes. The sauces are better than most fine dining restaurants here in town. If you have a sweet tooth and are lucky enough to go to 808 when the okinawan sweet potato cream puff is available make sure to get it. You'll find aome of the best local food anywhere right here."}
{"text":"I waited years to try this place, I love Hawaiian food.  This place is a dream come true. I get mixed plate with kalbi beef and BBQ beef.  Spam musubi was good too.  Can't wait to go here again and again."}
{"text":"The food is CONSISTENTLY amazing. Keep up the great work 808 MP! I'll always come back until my doctor tells me not to."}
{"text":"There's a first time for everything...for the first time, we finally tried 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate. We enjoyed it so much on our first visit, we went back again a couple of days later. Aunty Norma is the one in charge of the kitchen with her son(I think), and Jocelyn runs the front, taking orders and serving guests. They are so nice and really make us feel at home always making sure our orders were up to par.

 So far, we've tried their Garlic Chicken, Furikake Ahi, Fried Saimin, Somen Salad
BBQ Fries, and Kalua Pig and Cabbage which were all so ONOLICIOUS!!! Yes there
can be a wait at times, but it is worth it. at least I know my food is made to order and not sitting in a warmer or under a heat lamp.

We will most definitely be back, especially to try their Lau Lau plate on Fridays and other ono grindz!...ALOHA!!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(279/365) \"808 is GREAT!!!\""}
{"text":"No wait this morning. Awesome! We had fried saimin,  musubi, maki sushi, loco loco, fried rice special, saimin and everything was delicious! Beats IHOP 2 hour wait time any day"}
{"text":"It's amazing (and great) that there is such a large community of transplanted Hawaii folks in Las Vegas,  we don't refer to Vegas as the 9th island for nothing.  I was here over the holidays and got a chance to eat some pretty tasty food just like you'd get in da islands.

First thing when stepping inside the restaurant is that it \"feels\" like you're home in Hawaii, I swear it felt just like I stepped into an L&L or a LocoMoco drive in.  The next thing i noticed was everyone that was eating in there were ALL former Hawaii residents, all talking to each other,  talking about where they when grad from, where they moved from, etc.  It's really cool that there's like this network of \"locals\" far from home.

For our food, I had to try the deep fried spam musubi.  I just love the one at Da Kitchen on Maui so wanted to see how it compared.  The 808 HMP version is pretty awesome.  It has a really good crunch from the panko and I was happy that the coating adhered nicely to the musubi.  My only con about it was the musubi had a bit too much going on with the teriyaki sauce and the sriracha-mayo that was on it, the sauces overpowered the flavor a bit too much.

I also ordered a garlic chicken bowl, this was also good.  Not as good as the garlic chicken you'd get at places Sugoi or Mitsuken but reminded me more of the Yum yum chicken at aiea bowl or the Korean chicken at Zippy's, which isn't a bad thing.  The chunks of chicken thighs were cut a bit smaller which made it a bit easier to eat.  I'd say the sauce is more on the teriyaki side instead of the garlic side.

Aunty at the counter that took our order (I think she was the owner?) came over and asked how everything was.  I told her if I lived here, I would definitely be hitting this place up a lot.  It's a nice piece of \"home\" while being away."}
{"text":"Vegas has a lot of Hawaiian joints. I'm from the Bay Area, where we don't have too many (not as much as Vegas at least). So all I can compare this to is l&l or Hawaiian drive in BUT I WILL SAY this place was bomb. Ordered the garlic chicken, which is one of the more well known dishes, it was good! Lots of flavor and the chicken was cooked well"}
{"text":"I'm now a huge fan of this place! Everything we tried was excellent. Garlic chicken, wow! Kalbi was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Even the humble scoop of mac salad was great! Highly recommended if you're in the area! Do they have one of these in LA?!?"}
{"text":"This place is like a cheap whore with a heart of gold: shabby, well-worn, but run with love and with great prices. Lots of people pay a visit too. 

I only came because Poke Express, my go-to poke spot down the street is now closed on Wednesdays. I had been meaning to try the loco moco at this spot but I had a poke craving so I decided to go with it and order here. 

Though I love my raw fish spicy with light dressing (maybe kimchi and sesame oil), when I asked about their spicy poke bowl I was told it was sriracha mayo and masago mixed together, which is on the heavy side and very American to my taste. I went with it, ordered a side of shoyu, and I was pleasantly surprised at the taste when I got to try it. 

Though the dressing is a LOT and heavy, it went well. Wasn't spicy whatsoever so I sprinkled some of my own spicy chili flakes and furikake on it. I went with the salad, which was a lot and simple, but ate it with rice as well. The fish was smothered in sauce so I couldn't comment on how fresh it looked, but it was cut into perfect sized cubes and didn't taste old or weirdly soft, so there's that. I wish it came with more stuff in it, like green onions, or furikake, or something, but I get it, and for the price it was well-worth it. 

 Overall, I'd come back to try the loco moco, and maybe pick this if I had a craving for heavy poke."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plate then now is the time to do so. This place offers a variety of choices you would want. I ordered the firecracker chicken with sauce. I was surprised to have furikake and made my experience even better to relish. Don't skip on musubi which they have it deep fried."}
{"text":"Garlic chicken all da way! 808 is so amazing and the service is always wonderful! I love coming here because they show you the aloha spirit and makes me feel like I'm back home in Hawaii. I've never had a better garlic chicken and always want to try something else, but it's hard to step away from a favorite until I took the step to just try the deep fried musubi and fried saimin. In definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food in the 702! And the owners and employees treat you and make you feel like home!!"}
{"text":"Def the place to go for local food. I think the food has gotten worse over time though. It's not as good as it used to be. I usually order the Katsu chicken plate and spam musubi. Last time i got it, the Katsu chicken was soggy instead of crispy!! And the spam musubi was cold. Some days the food will be great and some days its the total opposite!! So good luck I guess lol"}
{"text":"I always get the mixed plate with garlic chicken, and it is nothing short of amazing. Great prices, great portions, and delicious food."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying at the Sante fe our last of 5 nights in Vegas. When I searched restaurants 808 came up. We are huge fans of Hawaiian and it's non existent where we are from. He got the Bbq chicken and the garlic chicken and I also got Garlic chicken and the Kalua Pork n Cabbage. Everything was delicious! The Mac the make is bomb too! We probably would of driven up from the strip more while we were here if we'd known about it sooner!"}
{"text":"Tried 808 for the 1st time 2 days ago! I was a bit taken back at the price of the Kal-bi ribs... $17.95, but the meat was at marketplace prices, so very fair. My husband really liked it and it was a huge portion and cooked correctly- well done. I had the hamburger steak which unfortunately was under cooked, but gravy was great like the kind back home in Hawaii. I just cooked it until it was pau (finished) in the microwave. You can have with or without the onions and mushrooms. I had it with. I was really bummed because the extra Mac salad I ordered I never got, but paid $2 for. Only noticed after i got home! So my husband who likes 2 got mines. I had a bite of it and it was really Ono. The girl at the counter was super nice and the staff cooking was full of Aloha. One of them even ran down to Poke Express to get the last bag of poi!  Now that's customer service! Mahalos! I did not try the Musubi but a family who came in after me, scarfed them down and then ordered more. So you know it's good! This place is really good and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Oh yah!  Because we accidentally ordered 3 orders of the deep fried spam musubi (which is about 18 pieces), I balanced it with ahi tuna on a bed of greens.  YUS, the loco moco looked astounding and so was everything else.  The hidden mouth-treasure is in their homemade shortbread cookies ;)"}
{"text":"OK so the food here was good. But pretty overpriced, in my opinion. The kal bi special was TWENTY DOLLARS. No joke. TWENTY. It was ten bucks for a poke bowl. Don't get me wrong, it tasted terrific, but damn. 

And then the service, yikes. The cashier missed an item in our order. When we pointed out that it was missing, she snapped, very rudely, \"Well, I  repeated your order to you, and you said it was right.\"

Then she just...walked away. OK...

If everyone didn't already have their food except for my one daughter, I would have left on the spot. Instead, we had to stand back in line and re-order the missed item. 

With all the other Hawaiian food options around here, I'm pretty sure we won't be back."}
{"text":"So I'm here visiting family, and was craving a snack. I had their DEEP FRIED musubi... WOW. I even ordered it as a takeout and it stayed crunchy while it sat in the takeout box! The flavors, the sauce, right amount of rice.... reminded me of a Godzilla roll but with spam. Yum yum yum! Can't beat the price either."}
{"text":"It's good but not great. 

-The poké had too much cream for my taste

-Furikake chicken tasted exactly like katsu chicken. We even thought we got the wrong order.

-Firecracker chicken just didn't have a special kick or any flavor that really stood out.

-The white rice has little bits of seaweed on it which was surprisingly good!

All in all, it's a cute spot ran by very friendly people but the food won't either wow or upset you. It's just...fine. I would probably not go back. Check out Island Flavor for Hawaiian food. They're absolutely the best!"}
{"text":"we came here to eat the poke we bought at poke express, but wanted to be courteous and buy something here for letting us sit down and eat. we got spamasubi which we didnt try until several hours later. they were really good!! not too salty and with just the right amount of flavoring and rice. wish we had gotten more!"}
{"text":"Don't place an order To Go without checking your food first!! I ordered the garlic chicken plate & a deep fried spam musubi. Both were extremely dry and had little to no sauce. Super disappointed with the quality of this order."}
{"text":"2 words, GARLIC CHICKEN! I found this awesome Hawaiian joint through Yelp and I'm sure glad I did because the garlic chicken is absolutely delicious. I don't live in the area, but I do work 10 minutes away so I've gone here once on my lunch break and another time after work. The chicken is amazing with breading almost identical to mochiko chicken. The garlic sauce is described as being \"miso garlic\" and isn't too overwhelming garlicy. They add chopped green onions to the top which give it a little bit of extra crunch and flavor. I may try the other items on the menu, but I have a feeling if I do I might say I should of gotten the garlic chicken because it's just that good. This place is legit because one of the times I came in most of the patrons eating looked like legit Hawaiians. They deserve 4.5 stars and I was thinking of raising it up to 5, but once the inside smelled like antibacterial which is very unappetizing (yuck!). I also introduced 808 Mixed Plate to my co-worker and she's been here more than me because she is in love with the garlic chicken too. This place might even be better than Island Flavor on the southwest side of town? As the Hawaiians say it, the chicken \"broke da mouth..\""}
{"text":"Most Hawaiian places have the usuals: loco moco, chicken katsu, spamasubi, etc. The nice surprise from this place was the garlic chicken.

Sometimes it's hard to stray from what you know will be good. I was very tempted by the loco moco, because it's hard to be disappointed.

They give a lot of chicken. At first, I thought they give you too much because the chicken part was super full, but then I looked under and it there was rice. Usually such a trick would sadden me, but this time I was actually happy. Mostly because I like rice with my meat and the ratio seemed off at first.

The chicken was somewhat sweet. It was a good sweet, and nicely cooked.  It went really well with their spicy mayo sauce."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant a few years now, it is always great and made fresh to order. The Garlic Chicken is so amazing I have to eat it at least once per week. yummmm   If you like salad too, you can get almost any dish made into a salad or served with rice."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite spot for a bite to eat in North Las Vegas so far.  

I ordered the mixed plate which comes with two meats of any kind on the menu, rice and salad (either macaroni or side greens). For my two meats, I chose the garlic chicken and the BBQ chicken.  I opted for the side salad instead of the macaroni salad and it came with two well-portioned scoops of sticky rice. 

As per the other reviews, the garlic chicken came highly touted, and rightfully so.  It was crispy and wasn't overly potent with garlic flavor. The BbQ was really tender (thigh meat) and juicy.  It was drizzled with sauce, but a little more \"charred\" taste would've made it better.  The rice was cooked perfectly to my liking, and the salad was... well, a small side salad with dressing. Not bad, not good. I did like the spiral-cut carrots."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the aunties are very welcoming and polite.  It is a bit small, I hope more people go so they can get enough funds to expand!  

It is a bit pricey but you do get a lot of food!  Try the fried musubi!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Gets a bit busy during lunch, but definitely worth the wait. I recommend the garlic chicken , deep fried spam musubi, and any of their bentos."}
{"text":"I usually come here and get good food. The other night I got loco moco and I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from it. I felt terrible that night. I was suffering from night sweats, nausea and woke up the next day and suffered all day. Too bad.. I won't be going any more."}
{"text":"The staff is sweet and the food is great. I tried the chicken katsu and the sauce is sweet and the chicken is very crunchy. It's clean and reasonably priced. This was my first time having Hawaiian food and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Portions are less and the prices are substantially more. :( 

Love the food and the atmosphere but with the rising costs, my visits become less frequent."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  My go to is the kalbi n garlic or furukaki chicken.  Kalbi is always tender and thick. Not like the 1/2 oz ones from aloha kitchen.  It also has nice flavor.  The chickens are basically just covered in different sauces or seasonings.  They all taste good.  I just ask for little more sauce on top.  I also had the Portuguese fried rice which I didn't really care for. Just stick to the mix plates and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. Everyone was attentive and friendly and the garlic chicken was amazing! Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Food was good not great. We got the Chicken Katsu, and Kalibi. Service was horrible. Cashier was not friendly at all. So much for the Aloha spirit. Choose I another venue if you care about service."}
{"text":"Whoa!  Three words. Miso. Garlic. Chicken.

I have only been here twice because unfortunately it's way on the other side of town for me as I reside in the Southwest area of Vegas.  But after the first time I tried their Miso Garlic Chicken, I drove my a** back there to get it again.  Yes!  It's that good.  I've also tried their Ahi Tuna, Musubi, and their Siamin soup; all are really good too.

This place is a definite must try if you're in the neighborhood.  It's not your normal L&L BBQ joint that sells Hawaiian food; the quality here stands way taller!  Customer service goes beyond limits as well!  Super nice!  I'll be back for sure; and yes, the drive is worth it!"}
{"text":"\"You look like you went to heaven and back\"

That was how my dad described my facial expression as I took a bite out of their garlic chicken. I spent the past two years thinking Island Grill (Eastern & Serene) made the best garlic chicken in town. I was proven wrong when I visited 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate this past weekend. 

We got there around 6pm on a Friday and were the only customer there. High ceiling, spacious, clean. From the place you order, you can see the kitchen which I thought was interesting. 

After looking through the pictures on yelp, I knew I had to try their garlic chicken. I believe there are two sizes, mini and original. You can choose either the tossed green salad or macaroni salad. Our food came out within 10 minutes! For $8-$9 a plate, the portion was huge. It came with 7-10 pieces of garlic chicken, two scoops of rice and the tossed green salad (Original size). 

Garlic chicken is very different from the one served at Island Grill. First of all, it comes with miso mayo. It was very subtle in flavor but very creamy. Second of all, garlic chicken itself is flavorful, tender and juicy unlike the garlic chicken at island grill which are crispy but can be dry at times. This amazing miso mayo, combined with juicy chicken=ONOLICIOUS!

Needless to say, I am coming back again very soon. Mahalo, 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate."}
{"text":"Eat at L&L?  You should think about eating here at 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate instead.  Nothing against the Mickey D's of the plate lunch crowd, but at least 808 is owned by some legit Hawaii folks, not franchised.  Yes, the Chinese owners of your local L&L CAN change your Hawaiian food and make it taste different.

Came here one night for dinner.  Lots of Hawaii locals, so you know it just may be a place to go for some ono eats.  Yelp, why did you just red underline the word ONO for me?  You would have figured by now your review section knows it means yummy!

Was near closing, and there was still a nice little line.  Luckily, what I came for they still had.  Other reviewers rave about the garlic chicken, and they weren't wrong.  This buggah was good!  Ordered a regular plate of this and wasn't sorry.  Pan fried, marinated chicken thighs, topped with miso-mayo sauce...BOMB!  And when you say garlic, it means GARLIC.  Flavored all the way through with that stinking rose!  So if you don't like garlic, either stay away, or order an extra scoop of rice or macaroni salad to balance out the kick.  Good for me that I love garlic.  Very good dish.

The wifey ended up with a $6 bento with fried saimin, Spam, teriyaki chicken, and a scoop of rice.  Tiny portion if you ask me, but it was enough for her.  The fried saimin had good flavor, and a hint of sweetness.  Put some cracked black pepper on top and you're ready to go.  She enjoyed it overall.

Menu at 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate is very similar to other Hawaiian joints like L&L and Aloha Kitchen.  Basics like teriyaki beef, chicken katsu, kalbi, and sesame chicken all on the list.  Specials can change daily but are plentiful and often varied.  I've seen:

-Pan roasted mahi mahi
-Misoyaki butterfish (like you find at Roy's)
-Oxtail soup (I must try)

Prices are reasonable, and will probably set you back around the $20-$25 dollar range for two people depending on what you order.  You get just enough food to fill your tummy.  But I wish the portions were a bit larger.  If you look on their Facebook page you should be able to order from 808 online with little hassle.  Or just call their phone number and place it that way.  They also do catering for your next party or keiki's 1st luau!  

Service was good, as one of the owners came around after our meal to ask us how everything was tasting.  It was after their closing time of 9:00 PM, but she told us no worries, and to take our time to 'talk story'.  Much mahalos for the love aunty, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Omg, hands down one of the best Hawaiian food restaurants I have been to. So good! Located on the north side of Las Vegas on Craig. They have a lot of different plates available to choose from, and the serving size is huge. I had leftovers for lunch the next day. I went with the garlic chicken plate and my  bf went with the teriyaki beef plate, both priced about $11. There are also bowls available if you would like a smaller serving size! They also have seafood options available. They cook your food as you order it so I recommend calling ahead to have it ready for you, even on a random Wednesday evening at 5 it was pretty busy"}
{"text":"This place had good food. Not like it was \"great wow\" food but it was okay. The teriyaki beef was standard thin beef with a bottled sauce over it. It was tasty but not memorable. The spam was of course spam so no disappoint there. And the chicken was moist and descent, but could of had more flavor.
Last thing, I'm always weary of places that have more than one soda flavor out....especially when the \"Out\" signs on them are or look older than two days.
C'mon pay your soda vendor!

Overall experience.... There was nothing standoutish about 808 but it was decent food for my plate!"}
{"text":"They have gotten better.  It's been two years since my last review.  We ordered a bunch of food recently.  The seared ahi was awesome.  The Kahlua pig and cabbage was tasty, but for $10 the portion seems a bit small to me.  The Kalbi Shortribs were some of the best I have ever had.  Well done.  Fast friendly service.  My only criticism:  I'm not a fan of market priced items.  There are just too many items with no prices on the menu for me.  I will eat here again though."}
{"text":"Garlic Ahi!!

Yes, their Garlic Ahi is the main reason I come here.  So good that I sometimes get two orders for myself.  The mini's portions are a bit small, so get the regular order if you decide on their Garlic Ahi.  

I've also tried their Spam Masubi, Katsu, and Loco Moco. You can't go wrong with their Katsu and Loco Moco.  Portions are huge.  Cheeseburger in PH probably has a bigger Loco Moco, but 808 is pretty close.  Must be at least a pound of ground beef in their Loco Moco's.  

Service here is always great.  I noticed that everyone is greeted on the way in, on the way out, and even sometimes while you're eating.  Prices are just about the same with everyone else, but remember you get the larger portions here.  One thing I noticed is that food takes a little longer to cook here.  Add a couple of people in front of you and your order can feel like an eternity to come out.  Food is still worth the additional 10 minutes here and I definitely recommend.  

If you're in the mood for Hawaiian, you can't go wrong here.  

Only Issues:
-No brown rice.
-Not open on Monday:  Not their fault, but I tend to crave for Hawaiian on Monday's.  Now I know and knowing is half the battle."}
{"text":"This place is Ono! Coco puffs are amazing! They have all the food from Hawaii. It's a little far from the strip but definitely worth the trip. Had the garlic chicken, Kalbi mix place with the furikake ahi. The owners are super nice and they will make your visit unforgettable."}
{"text":"This maintains itself as being a great restaurant.  When it is in a shopping area that has nothing spectacular in it, and still has a full house, you know they do something right.

I had the garlic chicken and the kalua pork.  Very delicious.  Balance of flavors.  One of the better pork dishes on the go.  

They FINALLY got rid of the screen with the office in the front corner.  Thank you guys for opening up the place 

I hope this place stays around a bit."}
{"text":"SOOO ONOO!!!!! I lived in Pupukea and used to go down makai side and eat Poke every other day. Since we moved back to mainland I have been DYING for Hawaiian grindz. We stopped here on our way through to California and are so glad we did. Not only are they priced super cheap (which means you can load up on more! Haha!! ) the food is onolicious. Seriously. The spicy poke was just how I remembered it. The ahi frukake is killah. Know we had to stock up on musubis for the rest of our trip.  

The tables were messy and full of dishes when we got there. But it's just because the foods so damn good and they always busy! Stay open minded the foods got soul."}
{"text":"Solid dishes and clean facility, they just take too long to serve the food. A bit high priced yet acceptable."}
{"text":"That Mahi mahi burger is good. But sometimes they don't have it and that sucks. If they had it all the time I'd give them 5 stars. The chicken is really good though firecracker and garlic both !!!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I moved to North Las vegas a few months ago and the one thing we really miss are all the great restaurants in the southwest side of town.  So, we were definitely glad that we found an authentic Hawaiian \"plate lunch\" type restaurant ! :)  
I love their garlic chicken with garlic miso, my husband love their beef stew ! 
Tip: Look for the daily specials posted on the side :)"}
{"text":"Fried Noodles topped with Garlic Chicken - Yummers!!!!!
Just wish they had chicken breast - (way more healthier than chicken thigh)
My nephew got the Loco Moco and even though I never order that dish , it looked yummy as well.
We also tried a piece of their Mango Cream Cake = it was light and creamy
Cream Puffs - I like that this wasn't overly sweet either
Both desserts had the right amount of sweet but sadly they aren't always offered......
Gosh, Darn -  this place is not at all near where I live and I am just about never in this area but if I am, I know where I'm eating...."}
{"text":"Best hawaiian/local food here in vegas! Drove from   south side just to try it out and it was worth the drive! I had the lau lau and kalua pig plate. Lomi lomi salmon was soooo good! Perfect for me. The garlic chicken with miso sauce was so bomb! Especially the garlic seared ahi, best fish I've had! I'm gonna finish this review off with saying the mac salad is hands down the best in vegas! It tastes just like my all time favorite (back at home in hawaii) from Zippy's. I will be coming here whenever I feel homesick. And I just moved here"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a Very Long Time, Now that I live Close by....I Will Be Returning! This is my 2nd time coming here, and I have not been Disappointed. The Owner of this Establishment is Oh So Friendly! It's like I was back in Hawaii! You get that Same Aloha Spirit Coming here! 

The Establishment is located on Craig Road, on the Left where Big Lots, and My Other Favorite Spot (Poke Express) is there as well! Always Clean, Great Customer Service. They did hire a New Counterperson, so Please be Patient with her. The Menu is Above the Ordering Counter. Drinks are located on the Right of the Counter, and the Restrooms are on the left. 

You can either Dine-In, or Take Out! If you Dine in, they Bring the Food to you. Although they Open at 11am (Closed Mondays) They Still Serve Breakfast all day! Woohooo!!! Their Menu Ranges from Hawaiian Delicacies like LauLau, Kalua Pork, Spam Musubis, and the List goes on....I really liked their Fried Saimin, and Furikake Chicken! Those are Da Bomb!

If you don't know what to Order, the girls at the Counter will be More than Happy to Help you! 

This is Most Definitely My Favorite \"Local\" Spot when I Need My Hawaiian Craving Met! =)"}
{"text":"A legit Hawaiian style eatery owned by local people from Hawaii. 

Items tried & liked (so far): 
Garlic Chicken
Firecracker Chicken
Shoyu Chicken
Fried Saimin
Saimin
Won Tun Min
Chili Dog Plate (special of the day) 
Cone Sushi 
Maki Sushi
Chantilly Cake 
Rainbow Cake

Their portions are generous and well worth the price. Just a tip, you get more for your money if you order a regular plate Insted of a mini. 

It has a very homey feel, I felt like I was at my aunties house back in Hawaii :) Staff was welcoming & friendly. Food was fresh and served up quickly. Definitely check them out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I wish they had a location in green valley. If they were I would be here many times a week. 
I work all over town, and so whenever I am going to be up around the Craig road area I make it a point to stop in. 
I haven't tried the whole menu, but for sure the garlic chicken is worth the trip all on its own. 
The people that work there are so friendly. The food takes some time to make, but the quality of food shows! I can't complain about a single thing. If you get a chance to go here then you definitely need to go."}
{"text":"After being in the mainland for a week, we were sick of eating pizza/tacos/chicken/pasta so we looked for Hawaii food and found it. (Thanks, fellow yelpers!)

Food was more 'ono than home and that's saying a LOT. And they give choke food! CHOKE! And the prices are good. $5 for a mini bento that was huge.

Excellent food!!! Go get em go get em go get em now go!!!"}
{"text":"We came here after a movie with our Sons who love this place and I have to admit, it's great.  I had the 808 Combo plate with Garlic Chicken and the Kalbi ribs. Damn good. Wifey had the Combo with the Garlic Chicken and Katsu Chicken. Also great. Clean place with friendly people. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Walking in, it was apparent that this was authentic island food. They use iPads and square reader to ring transactions. they accept apple pay, but have to enter your tip amount$ first then swipe or insert card. hmm, first time I've seen this.

But the two ladies asked if it was our first time, we mentioned we've been to other hawaiin places down in henderson. Right away, she asked one of the cooks to cook a garlic chicken. I was confused because I had not ordered yet. But this was to make us fresh samples to taste! wow!

she described the miso sauce they use on top of the chicken, which by the way (10/10 would recommend) she mentioned that we can have it on top or on the side, which ever we prefer.

After we got our order (they walked it over to us) they kept checking in on us & asking if we were okay. 
they clean and bus their own tables.

they gave us a to go box for me (portions are fair and large)
ORDER THE GARLIC CHICKEN, soo gooooood!!!"}
{"text":"Alohaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}
{"text":"Wow! This food is delicious! I've eaten at plenty HI places in Vegas & this is by far the best. 

It's a family owned business, & it feels like eating at a friends house.

I had garlic chicken & spare ribs mixed plate. Ahhhmazzing (though pricy $15) it's so worth it if you don't mind spending the extra $4 in comparison to other HI places. Very filling & tasty. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Vegas is called the 9th Hawaiian Island for a reason.... and it's because of 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate! Having just come back from a week long vacation in Hawaii, I've been feeling the withdrawal symptoms and have been overdosing on every Hawaiian restaurant in the Valley to make me feel better. After a month of testing out different places, 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate has been my favorite so far. 
The restaurant isn't in the best of neighborhoods, the restaurant isn't the most sparkling clean- but this just gave it a slightly more Hawaiian feel ;) The girl at the counter wasn't the most helpful and their menu was pretty confusing. Don't forget to look down, back, side to side... They seem to have specials and mixed plate signs all over the place. Also they have a happy hour where your order is 15% off? I didn't see a sign, not sure of the time! 
CHICKEN CHICKEN CHICKEN. ORDER THE CHICKEN. The furikake chicken and the katsu chicken plate were the best I've ever had. Both had very thick filets and were soft to the point they melted in your mouth. It really disappoints me when the breading is twice as thick as the piece of chicken itself, but that was not the case here. So much chicken, so much flavor, perfect amount of breading (for the katsu). 
The garlic mahi mahi was okay, but I think the chicken is where they shine. The mac salad was good, but had chunks of potatoes in it which made it not only feel thick, like mac salad usually feels to me, but also heavy. It was good, but hard to take more than a couple of bites! 
I love mom and pop shops and I love seeing owners interacting with customers or even working in booths inside the restaurant rather than in the back. It always gives it a more family- feel. I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent ,authentic, good eating food.
Prepared by a terrific jovial happy to serve you staff. 
Truly a delightful and refreshing find ."}
{"text":"Very good Hawaiian food, friendly service, clean dining room and fair prices make 808 MHP worthy of a visit if you live in the North side of town."}
{"text":"You've never had a kalbi plate like this! Super thick cut of kalbi beef! Luckily, they slice it up for your so you don't have to struggle with a knife. You can witness the thickness of the kalbi because the bones are still there. Enjoy gnawing on the meat off the bones or give them to your pooch as a nice treat. You can request without the bone too. 

Seems like everyone likes the garlic chicken. Will come back to try that next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best taste of Hawaii I've had in a long time. Looking for something that's somewhat authentic head here. It is bombDOTcom!"}
{"text":"I love their customer service! Their food is amazing. I have used their restaurant.com specials and am extremely satisfied. The owner is a sweet heart and was very attentive. I took my mom here, first time eating Hawaiian and she as well was pleased with both the food and service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Never order from this place through Uber Eats. I ordered my food at the 230pm, and the estimated time of pick up was 3pm. At 330, I called to check on my order, the person on the phone answers the phone, continues on a different conversation,  then tells me to hold. While I'm holding,  I'm listening to her conversation and 3 mins of waiting, she hangs up the phone on me. I wait 10 mins, and she answers the phone to tell me, at 345, that they didn't get my order in, and it will be another 20 mins before they finish.  Absolutely the worst customer service experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Garlic chicken and Mac salad is delicious ... I didn't care so much for some of the employees one in particular ...and it is a little pricey.  My partner really liked this place and had no complaints. We will go back again someday"}
{"text":"Nice service here! Food is delish & staff are friendly. Very laid back with island music playing. Orders are placed at the counter and you serve your own drinks. Food is then brought to your table. I tried the BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, noodles & kalua pork.... yummy!"}
{"text":"Chef Brenton never seems to fail at being the person so courteous at all times, let it be just greeting and saying goodbye to us, we always feel that aloha. The food is always Onolicious, like the Kalbi or Garlic chicken or Fried Saimin with Teri Beef on the side. It brings that old saying \"Broke Da Mouth!\" The Loco Moco needs no explanation but Damn good! Anytime I need the feel of being back home in Hawaii or making an excuse to get to the north side of town, there is no way we can pass up the grinds here. Also if you're in the need for some wicked Poke, it's just a walk down the sidewalk. Mahalos to the gang at 808 Mixed Plate for bringing that perfect and most of the time better than back home mixed plates and specials of the day. Don't stop making the \"Mean Kine\" desserts too!"}
{"text":"All of the chicken dishes I've tried were really good. I liked the Ono Chicken, Garlic Chicken, Furikake Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and the Katsu. I've also tried the roast pork which had a smoky flavor, and kahlua pork which was tasty.

The spam musubi was a little disappointing, there was more rice and less spam than I'm used to. They have some special menu items, but they ran out of it so we couldn't order it.

It's a very casual restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place even though I've been getting nothing but the chicken plates and only been here twice they seem to always satisfy me. My personal favorites by far is the Ono and Garlic Chicken. If it were my decision, I would rename the Ono Chicken to Oyea Chicken lol. The owners are nice and always recommend a variety of plates to me. They maintain very clean tables and have a 50 inch TV to watch the big games while you grub. Prices are fair compared to the quality of the food you receive. Whenever I'm hungry and in the area I'll be sure to stop by here for more off their menu."}
{"text":"Great for lunch! Good prices for great quality and authentic Hawaiian food. Super chill vibe and great service. 

Had the Kailua pork and cabbage and ahi poke as an 808 mixed plate. Tried firecracker chicken (not spicy at all) and short ribs (delicious sauce!). Very filling and enough food for two meals."}
{"text":"Y'know how when your significant other asks you \"where do you want to go eat,\" and you always say \"I don't know..where do you want to go?\" Then, it becomes some circular argument for over 15 minutes before you guys settle on something? Now, I finally have an answer to my husband's question!! This is theeeee place to go to when you want a simple lunch!! The lady at the counter was awesome for giving my husband a military discount on his meal without him asking (she noticed my husband's debit card was from a military bank)! Anywho, onto the meal! 

I ordered the garlic chicken with miso mayo per Yelp's suggestions, and OMG it was amazingggggg! The chicken was slightly crispy, garlicky, and sweet from the outside, and chicken meat ohhhhh so soft and tender on the inside! It came with two scoops of rice plus your choice of toss salad or mac salad (8.50), and the boo got the kahlua pork with cabbage! His dish was amazzzziiiing as well (shhh i snatched his leftovers at home)! The kahlua pork complemented the rice so well! The meals here get you comfortably full, with some left over to take home!

They bring out the food to your table if you're dining in, so pleaseeee don't forget to tip them when they ring up your food :)"}
{"text":"Yummy, cheap, a thousand times better than Panda Express or any other main-stream place (such as L&L). This is a very non-assuming joint in a big shopping center off of Craig in North Las Vegas, but if you find it, you have found a gem!

I went here on a lunch date with a friend of mine and we arrived just around 11:40 AM on a Friday. There were open booths/tables and a small line. We both took our time checking out the menu and decided to get one of their daily specials, the \"808\" special. You get two choices of entrees (however it is limited to certain ones), and your choice of slaw, rice, or a mixed green salad. 

My friend and I like to share so we thought this would be the best way for us to try a bunch of different things, so here's what we got:

Chicken Katsu
Shoyu Chicken
Grilled Salmon
Garlic Ahi
Spam Musubi (2)

My favorites were definitely the grilled salmon and the garlic ahi. The chicken was so-so. So I would absolutely reccomened the fish dishes over anything else here. The salmon seriously had this amazing flavoring in it that made it so yummy. My friend doesn't even like salmon and she said she liked this one. The musubi was good too and it had just come out fresh when we ordered ours.

I love that you can get a green salad here as a side. This one they had was great too - leafy greens, very fresh and with a nice side of dressing as well. 

If you live in the NLV area you should definitely make it a habit to come here. I know I'm going to be coming back."}
{"text":"Today was their last day open! THEY ARE NOW CLOSED FOR GOOD :( the girl told me they MIGHT open a new location..."}
{"text":"When you want real local island style food, you gotta stop in dis place. If you want poki then you gotta stop in Poki Express and come walk over to 808 for everything else. These two places will remind you of being back home on da islands because they treat you like family and you will think your mom and grandma made everything.
Come chop and you won't ever regret it."}
{"text":"I ordered take out for lunch.  There was a party of 3 already sitting at a table waiting for their lunch.  I ordered a Chicken Katsu plate and a Kalbi plate and paid at the counter and waited almost 20 minutes for my food. They offer a military discount since they are fairly close to Nellis Air Force Base in North Las Vegas.

About a dozen Spam Musubi were sitting on the counter.  They were still warm.  I picked up 2 of them.  They were sweet and melt-in-your-mouth goodness.

The Chicken Katsu looked like it had been refried.  It was pretty dark and dried out.  It was served wih a red ketchup-like sauce rather the sweet brown sauce that I am used to with Katsu.

The Kalbi was cut up into small strips which was nice.  It wasn't charred because I asked for it to be grilled medium.  It was a little fatty and over seasoned.  For $12, it was a little pricey.

Both entrees were served on a bed of rice with a scoop of rice and macaroni salad.
I would give them another try.  I just wouldn't order either dish again.  There are so many Hawaiian restaurants to try."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly but the food just doesn't have that quality we are looking for especially for the price."}
{"text":"Tried their chicken katsu, and while the chicken was good, the katsu sauce tasted like salad dressing. Or maybe it was the salad dressing? But whatever the case, you should always have chicken katsu served with katsu sauce and and it definitely should taste like it. Well, maybe I'd go back again; but next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"It is a sad day for the Hawaiian food scene, today 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plate is closing its door. For eight great years they have given us food from their hearts! Through the good times and the difficult times, they showed their Aloha towards each and every person who came through their door. We'll miss the times we spend together loving your food and sharing memories of Hawaii. We thank you for your Aloha and the love you shared with us. We wish you the best and know that you are in our thoughts always. MISS YOU ALREADY!!!!! Las Vegas will miss you."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Hawaii and have heard good things about 808. Friday night and this is our dinner choice.

It's nestled right in a small mall area right next to a soul food place (Ella Em's) which i have bookmarked to also visit. What a coincidence! 

As we arrived we could tell that it was a little steady, walked in and was able to get a seat right away. The inside and searing reminds me of a place back home called Islanders or L&L.

Looking at the menu there are quite a bit options including spam musubi and some Island favorites like Hamburger Steak, Garlic Chicken, Kalbi, etc....Yum!!!!

Got up to the counter to order and had decided on what we wanted, low and behold they were out of what we wanted..okay so what should we get...
Finally went with Garlic Chicken plate, Kaukau Pack (Fried Saimin, Rice, Spam, Sesame Chicken and Grilled Fish) chicken and fish is able to interchange, Spam Musubi and Hurricane Fries (Furikake and Garlic). Total came out to $33.00 with drink. Still a little pricy. The line grew behind us and everyone was surprised to hear that were out of a lot of menu options. I mean it was 5pm and already out of it. 

Food came out pretty quick, in about 10-15 minutes. My daughter was happy with her musubi and i was fairly happy with my Kaukau Pack except for the fish and the very small scoop of rice. Fries, Garlic Chicken and potato mac was ono!!!

Whenever we find a local spot we always like to give it a try and support, i think we'll be back to give it another shot but maybe for lunch instead to be sure that all menu items are available.

I give this place 3 stars due to the fact that what we wanted twice around wasnt available and the fact that the counter interaction was not positive. Hoping to update this review with more stars added on!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're craving for local Hawaiian food, this is the place to go! My favorites would be the Bbq chicken, fried noodles, grilled mahi-mahi, and salmon! I'm from the 808, and this is as close as it gets!!!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Ah another little gem of North Las Vegas! My coworker and I came here for lunch in order to celebrate my work anniversary. We came in at exactly noon and it was packed. All of the tables were full or recently vacated with plates still on the table and about 4 people ahead of us in line. Thankfully the crowd cleared out pretty quickly and we were able to score a table after ordering. 

Now to the good stuff, the food. I ordered the garlic chicken bowl with a side of poke. The bowl was just the right portion size for me and the flavor is amazing. It's sort of like a crispy chicken with a mayo type sauce. The poke was very good too, great flavor and very fresh tasting. 

The service here is awesome too. It seems like it might be family owned and they constantly come around to check how you're doing and offer to bring anything you need. Great service, great food, all around great!"}
{"text":"Awesome mixed plate joint, they have great selection and nice laid back atmosphere. We will miss all the good Hawaiian food in LV when we move."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times and this place is by far one of the best Hawaiian spots in town.  Without the pictures to prove it, here is the list of must haves so far:  Kahlua Pork with Cabbage, Kalbi Short Ribs Mid-rare, Garlic Chicken, Firecracker Chicken, Furikake Chicken, and the Deep Fried Musubi.  Don't listen to naysayers, this spot is legit.  Whatchu tink?

6-5-18:  so sad to hear this restaurant has closed down.  I really don't understand because every time we had gone it was busy and the food and service are both excellent.  Very few great Hawaiian places left in town but if you guys hear of one, please let me know.  Now for me it is only Island Flavor in the Southwest.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"Before I went to the planetarium at CSN Cheyenne, I looked for a place to grub with my family. We're from the Southwest area, so we know & love Island Flavor. With the prices being a little more on the high side, I expected bigger portions & more flavor. We ordered 3 spam musubis, ono chicken bowl, katsu chicken bowl & garlic chicken bowl. The ono & garlic tasted the same, except the ono had some sort of sweet mayo sauce & sesame seeds; I liked the ono best. The spam musubis were average. The inside was kinda dirty. The table next to us had plates, bowls, napkins & drinks on it. There were 2 workers just standing around & didn't bother to clean it up. The drink station is a fountain with iced tea, hi-c fruit punch, coke & sprite. But the area where the straws are was dirty. Stains of spilled drinks, open sugar packets & straw wrappers were everywhere. No napkins to be seen. Most likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and have not been let down.  My friends and I made sure to order different things and share to get the most for our money.  I like the daily specials the most, I had the garlic chicken w/miso mayonnaise and the seared furikaki ahi and both were as we say back in Hawaii \"broke da mouth\".  The location is inconvenient but worth the drive.  YUMMY!!!!"}
{"text":"Yeeeeesssss!

I found this place on accident.  I was looking for a poke place in the area, but it was closed.  Luckily, I saw this gem from Craig Road, and decided to give it a try - made safer by noticing their great Yelp reviews.

I'm not super familiar with Hawaiian food, so it took me a long time to decide.  The friendly clerk let me take my time and politely answered my questions.  I ordered a breaded chicken dish with seaweed (see, I don't remember what it was called! maybe the katsu?) at the recommendation of the clerk after giving her an idea of what I like to eat.  After I ordered and paid, I noticed a sign for a daily special - a poke bowl!  I almost switched my order, since that's what I was originally after, but I decided to try something new.  My friend ordered the poke bowl, though, so I got to try it anyway. 

I was glad that I got my dish.  It was delicious.  The sweetness of the chicken balanced with the salty seaweed shreds and the perfectly cooked rice was amazing.  I also very much enjoyed stealing bites from my friend's poke bowl.  

Prices were very reasonable.  Portions were large - I had to take some of mine to go.

Good stuff!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"For starters, it's probably my fault because I only ordered spam musubi, but for something so simple I didn't think it would be so disappointing. My boyfriend and I are both sick so I figured I would just go get something small and simple to take home. I live right between this restaurant and the one on Craig/Decatur but chose this one today because of the higher star rating on Yelp. My first impression was good, there was more people dining in than I've ever seen at the other place which is always a good sign. I ordered 4 spam musubis to-go and my total was 1 dollar more than it should have been. Their prices on the menu board are outdated, which I hadn't realized. Then 20 seconds after I paid she hands me my order! She must have known what I was thinking because she answered my question before it was asked. They are pre-made. Disappointment. Oh well its a simple side food, I went on my way. Once I got home I realized these are the thinnest spam slices I've ever seen on a musubi! And there was more rice than normal too. It had no flavor, barely even tasted like spam. I'll probably be sticking to the other Hawaiian restaurant for my musubi needs since they charge less and give more meat. Plus their sauce has flavor. 

Overall, I might return to try some of their other menu items, but definitely not for my spam musubi cravings. 

At least the lady was nice."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with anything on their menu. I normally get the garlic chicken, kalbi or the kalua pork. Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Food always prepared fresh & the portions are amazing! A place to hit up if you're craving some hawaiian food! Great customer service too! Thanks Auntie! Lol"}
{"text":"Garlic chicken every time! Try extra miso mayo for more flavor. The only downside is that they do not offer a grilled version."}
{"text":"The people working there were super nice! The food was AMAZING and such a great price! I got an order of spam musibi and the spicy poke with sushi rice, absolutely to die for. Kind of a small place and was full. Would highly recommend this place to friends and family. Their entire menu looks delicious. I was so stuffed from the poke I struggled to finish my musibi!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. One of the girls even gave my son a quarter for the little toy machine. I love their spam musubi! My son loves the food, my husband loves the food and we have been here twice now:)"}
{"text":"Not many reasons to come to North Vegas but 808 Mix Plate makes it worth it. Authentic Polynesian food made by Polynesian people!

There's really not a bad choice on the menu and so far everything has tasted delicious. Garlic chicken is my favorite and the macaroni salad is top notch Hawaiian Macaroni style. I always top it off with at least 1 spam musubi too!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Hawaiian eateries in Las Vegas. The staff is so inviting and you never feel like your just a customer. I love their Garlic Mismo Chicken which is wonderfully put together. Their mac salad has become one of my weaknesses..Awesome food!!!Nothing on the menu has disappointed me"}
{"text":"I moved from Chicago just over a year ago.  I do miss the food in Chicago, BUT at least I can explore and find the hidden gems in LV.  I MUST admit, 808 is a hidden/new found treasure for me!  I have tried several Hawaiian restaurants BUT so far HANDS down, 808 is the best!!!  A few days ago was my 1st time checking this spot out.  My son and I decided on the Katsu chicken and garlic chicken.  It was the BOMB.COM!!!  Even the macaroni salad was delicious, as well as, the brown gravy over the rice .... whhaaaatt!!! This place is so good to me, I called later that day and asked if they cater because I am throwing a home warming and 808 dishes will definitely be included in my menu!! ;^)  Thanks 808!!"}
{"text":"I love this place their Kalbi beef is seriously the best it is cooked perfectly and not overly fatty so you get a lot for your money. The service is great here also always very friendly and fast. Their musubi is also good they do it deep fried or regular. Recently I tried the firecracker chicken and it was delicious with a little bit of spice their garlic chicken is also very good and flavorful. The BBQ chicken is also very good, pretty much everything we have tried has been worth it."}
{"text":"A definite 5 Star.  We were only in Vegas for 3 days and we ate here twice. Service was friendly and fast.  The food was excellent.  In the two visits, we ordered the Spicy Ahi Poke Rice Bowl, Breakfast Plate with portuguese sauges, Mix Plate with Grilled Garlic Mahi-Mahi and Garlic Chicken, Kimchi Fried Rice and Spam Musubi.  What made us come back was the Spicy Ahi Poke Rice Bowl and the Mix Plate.  Reasonably price and excellent taste. 

Parking is not a problem.  It's in a shopping center.

A 'must-try' if you haven't gone here."}
{"text":"Super yummy! I'm so glad this place is close to my house. I only wish they brought back the cakes ... I got excited to see it on the menu online but they said they stopped doing cakes for a while. Bummer! Please bring back cakes; dobash, chantilly, coconut, guava & RAINBOW the best cake ever!"}
{"text":"Came to this place on the whim. I was playing in a basketball tournament and the gym was about 5 minutes away. I had 3 hours in between games so rather than driving all the way back to the strip, we decided to stay close for lunch and boy am i glad we found this place.

Ordered:
-Mixed plate (Garlic Chicken / Kalbi): Both were delicious! That garlic chicken is pretty decadant and flavorful while still being crispy like katsu. The kalbi was cooked med rare perfectly and was so tender and tasty. Love that they put furikake on the rice, feels like home :)
-Fried Spam Musubi: So crunchy! They use panko bread crumbs and fry it so well! My first time ever having it fried, and it definitely wont be my last!
-Hurricane fries: you can skip this one. its just fries with furikake. Nothing special for the price. 
-Katsu bowl: fried perfectly. a solid option.

The service is great here. A little family-run hole in the wall kind of place, but one you can't miss out on!"}
{"text":"The best Hawaiian food in Vegas. Their garlic chicken mixed plate is delicious. Their macaroni potato salad is very home made."}
{"text":"This place has more hype on yelp nowadays. When I first came here it was less \"known\" Somethings you just don't want to keep a secret. The food is still great and the menu is still cheep. They do seem to run out of certain things on the menu, they always have something good. What more could you ask for. 

The garlic chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The wasabi sauce for the fish is dynamite."}
{"text":"Hawaiian style beef stew just like back home:) I shall return for the Filipino Superman's pastele stew and gandule rice! Keep serving up broke da mouth onolicious Local grinds my bruddah"}
{"text":"Good place to eat love there first time sample food was good I let them choose my plate well pick will be going there"}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I got several mixed plates for the family, so we got to try a little of everything. The nice thing is that you can get half and half of the meats on each plate, so if you can't decide between kalbi and garlic chicken, you can get both. The garlic chicken and chicken katsu weren't anything special. The garlic chicken was smothered in some sweet sauce. It was good but not garlicky. The kalbi was a little disappointing. The meat was kind of dry, seasoning was sweet. The roasted pork in mushroom sauce was pretty good. It wasn't quite what I expected since the pork seemed almost like it was stewed with the sauce. This place wasn't bad, but the photos look a lot better than the actual food."}
{"text":"definatly worth it! massive portions. One of the best Hawaiian places I've had in a long time the food is always top notch the staff is friendly and the place is very clean 5 stars all across the board!"}
{"text":"+ Food is awesome!
+ Service is awesome!
- Nothing! 
Go get some Hawaiian Food and make your belly happy."}
{"text":"Love love love his place!  The korean chicken, spam musubi, katsu chicken, bbq beef, fried samion, and garlic chicken are all really good. Haven't had the kalbi ribs yet bcause it takes alittle longer for them to cook and I'm usually getting it to go but I hear they are real good.  The people that work here are super nice too.  First hawaiian food resturant I've eaten at and I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"So I've come here about 4 times, each time it was closed. Today I finally got here early enough. Family owned, and very clean. 

   Now to the food. My hubby got the grilled salmon, boy was it fresh. Absolutely delish!  
I got the garlic chicken . It was a heaping helping,  and and was the best I've had.

  Oh yes I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new and this place had great reviews. We ordered dine in, it seemed liked they were training. We ordered garlic chicken hurricane fries & mixed platter with Kalbi ribs and some chicken ( wanted firecracker chicken but they were out of it but was told there substitute would be the same). Advised both clerks my wife has a mushroom allergy but was told none of the food has mushrooms (my wife now has hives probably from cross contamination because the clerks refused to tell the back of the house of the allergy).Decided to tip because I work in the industry. After waiting 25 minutes the cashier asks us if we order to go or for here even though the receipt says dine in just like the ones on their board. After a total of 35 minutes we got our food( they brought a fork and knife to me but nothing for my wife's entree, I had to ask) which was cold, the only thing that was hot was the basic white rice. The chicken substitute was not the same although I've never had firecracker chicken ( I asked if it would be spicy and they said yes, it was not) the flavors were good, also the hurricane fries we delicious. Just wish the food was hot. Decided to ask for a box instead of throwing away food, while waiting in line for a box I watch a hot plate of food sit in the window for 3 minutes before served and chef never rang the bell next to it. Chefs are always adamant about food getting hot to a guest but he could care less as he looked at 4 times without a care in the world. Food has good potential but needs some better management and the chef should take more pride in his food. FOOD SHOULD NEVER EVER SIT IN A WINDOW. THAT IS YOUR MASTERPIECE, DISPLAY IT PROUDLY!
Suggestions: Make your rice stand out, add chicken stock, butter, seasoning, something to stand out.
Working more than one position is very difficult (I know from expierence) if they can't run food, chefs or cooks should, your restaurant is not that big it takes a minute or 2 and you had a total of 3 employees in the back so it wasn't backing up. Plus guest love meeting the chef who prepared their amazing meal.
If your gonna run a gourmet type fast food make a station for to go boxes ( I know they cost money), it easier then waiting in line for a box. Also if your gonna bring entrees make sure you bring silverware for each entree. That's the worst of the whole expierence that we order 2 entrees and she brought us 1 set-up that's common sense and the fact that I had to ask you expect my wife to eat her garlic chicken with her hands come on now. Get it together."}
{"text":"Amazing we had an opportunity to order from here for our working place and the food was delicious! they gave a lot of food and even though they are closed on Monday, they did make those accommodations which I think the customer service on that aspect was amazing as well!

We ordered  kalua pig, macaroni salad, chicken katsu and musubi and of course rice.
The macaroni  is made with potatoes too, which is different but I actually enjoyed it.

Now usually take about my chicken katsu be as if the sauce is me too sweet this sauce  was good.. It's not your normal katsu sauce...its tangy-sweet....

The reason for the 4 stars is because they  are way up on Craig Road..they need to be right around the corner from me LOL!

Also they gave a lot for a great price we will be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"How can I not rate this as a five star choice? 

Staff- Amazing and family owned  CHECK!
Food- Delish beyond belief   CHECK!
Setting - Clean and uncluttered  CHECK!

I ordered the bbq beef mini plate. This beef was so awesome that I stuffed myself more than I wanted to for lunch. I didn't eat the rest of the day. I wanted to run around the restaurant wearing the bbq beef on my face like that Buffalo Bill guy from Silence of the Lambs who was making the flesh suit. \"Put the lotion in the basket!!!\". Yeah, him. It was THAT good."}
{"text":"Garlic chicken had a nice glaze and sauce.  It wasn't too garlicy and had good flavor. The rice in the cone sushi wasn't as sticky as I would have expected but it had good flavor.  My friends loved the saimin!  All in this place has really good eats!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 starts because the ONE time I've been here it was amazing. Other than that I have been back about 7 or 8 times and it's always CLOSED. I understand it's family operated but it seems like this family goes on personal trips every month. Wish they would stay true to their posted hours."}
{"text":"Very polite, they asked if it was my first time,  have me samples to try. Good was very good, really flavorful. Had garlic chicken,  and portion and cabage. Really healthy too.
 They deserve a bigger restaurant, that would make them perfect."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for Hawaiian food! The poke is the bomb! Kalbie is good! I'm working my way to the burgers."}
{"text":"I love this place.   You have to try the garlic chicken with miso mayo.  Had a dessert called poi mochi.  If you like mochi you will love this.   Not very sweet and really chewy.   Everytime I have come here the service is great and all of the workers are very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow, talk about the Aloha spirit. Traveling through on business. First time in LV and haven't had Local food in almost 3 years due to our family being stationed in Europe. Driving to Nellis AFB and happened on this gem of a restaurant. Let me tell you the food was awesome and the Aloha spirit was truly exceptional. Although I haven't been able to go home to Hawaii in a while, I truly felt the spirit of Aloha through the food and hospitality of the locals that own and work in this wonderful establishment. 

Mahalo 808 for making my first time in LV a tasteful one. BTW the poi, garlic chicken, and kalbi was AWESOME!!!!! See you guys again when I pass through LV."}
{"text":"I ordered the firecracker chicken and hurricane fries. The chicken was excellent. It tasted great and was the perfect portion. The fries were a drawback, the amount of seaweed that they use just overpowers it all. Menu items were decently priced and the service was great. I'll be heading back for more chicken."}
{"text":"I got the garlic chicken plate that comes with 2 scoops of white rice and macaroni salad. The chicken was packed with flavor and I love the sauce that was drizzled on top. I would recommend calling in during lunch or ordering online to get your food faster. Solid hawaiian food, wayyyy better than L&L!"}
{"text":"The food I just had was great the BBQ chicken with white rice and Mac Salad is absolutely amazing. On Fridays they also have a special menu offering the Kalu Pig I will be getting that next time. Loved the staff so nice thank you."}
{"text":"BF and I wanted a Hawaiian day and got poke at Poke Express and then grabbed a lunch plate to share. 

We got the 808 Special Mix Plate where you get to pick two meats, rice and mac for $9.50. We picked sesame chicken and shoyu chicken. 

It's not as fast as other mixed plate places. That I suppose is can be a good thing since it's freshly cooked. We had some poke to nosh on from Poke Express anyways while we waited. 

We bit into the sesame chicken and I thought it was supposed to have sauce so we asked if we can have some sauce. They said they were out of the sesame sauce...er, okay, thanks for letting us know when we got our order. I never had sesame chicken so I don't quite know now what it's really supposed to taste like. We asked for some katsu sauce then since it just needed something to dip the fried chicken in. Their katsu sauce is more tangy, almost ketchup-y compared to other places I've gone to. The shoyu chicken is 2  bone in thigh and it reminds me of Filipino adobo, but sweeter since it stews in the shoyu. The mac is interesting in that it has potato, and tuna in it...it's pretty good to me, but for some people who like plain mac might not be into it. 

Overall the place was an okay place to get plate lunch. I'm very curious how their lau lau and kalua pork stack up. Til next time- 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot when we're wanting Hawaiian food in LV. This place is the BEST for getting authentic Hawaiian dishes. My boyfriend is from Hawaii and we go back frequently. This place reminds us of one of the local spots in Hawaii and that says something. Everyone is extremely friendly and gives the Hawaiian hospitality every time you walk through the door. Every dish on the menu is delicious and flavorful. You can't go wrong with any of them. We've never had a bad dish or experience. My favorite is the garlic chicken plate with mac salad and my boyfriend loves getting the Garlic bento. I definitely recommend coming here if you want great Hawaiian food & customer service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. They were very accommodating to allow our big group to reserve the entire eating area for lunch in advance."}
{"text":"Love love love! I'm a super boring, picky eater with random bouts of exotic tastes. This is a favorite go to on Sundays and when new people come to town lol. Love the garlic chicken-the sauce is addictive!  Kids beg for it weekly:)"}
{"text":"Yet another establishment I might not have tried if I hadn't found their awesome rating on Yelp...even though I frequented Teriyaki Madness a few suites over plenty for a while.

808 Hawaii Mixed Plate has some of the greatest Hawaiian BBQ dishes I've had. If the wait time wasn't so long, I would have easily given them a 5 stars. However, every time I've gone, it's been about a 45 minute wait from getting in line to order to getting the food. Usually I'd be a little ticked off by this, but once I take a bite of the food that's a little bit of heaven, it's nearly erased from my mind.

The garlic chicken...I can't even begin to describe it. It's so delicious; seasoned well and accompanied by such a unique and tasty sauce. The short ribs are pretty good as well. Also, the macaroni salad is different than most Hawaiian BBQ places I've had. In my opinion, it's better. Not bland or too creamy. 

I totally recommend trying this place out. If you can, call first! Sadly, I haven't been able to find their menu online anywhere. Doesn't mean you can't ask them. The girl working behind the counter has always been super nice."}
{"text":"Needed food for a volleyball tournament. Chicken katsu was good and the beef plate was great. Very soft and tender. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was not good at all. The beef that I got was full of fatty pieces that were uneatable. I was disappointed in the Mac salad as it had way too many potatoes in it, should of been called potato salad. I left hungry and had to pick up food on the way home."}
{"text":"I come here often ,because of the flavor and its different from other Hawaiian restaurants.Well looks and tastes like some things have changed , added more itesms to their menu , but also changed the way some of the menu items are cooked ,  I this time ordered the 808 pack because I want the combination of beef and chicken.  I noticed that the beef was cooked like any other Hawaiian restaurant where before the beef used to be cooked over a grill and have grill flavor taste.... Not this time ,I wont be back here for a while. .."}
{"text":"Great Kalbi Short Ribs here!

These were super thick cuts...steak like! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/808-hawaii-mixed-plate-north-las-vegas?select=Om0WsPU8yTKLX35G-3nUxw

Cooked perfectly to order, with lots of flavor and juices! Very fatty though, but just eat around it to get all that goodness. These took a solid 20min to prepare and cook to a great medium rare, but it was worth the wait.  A little spendy at a solid $15, but it is more like a steak than your average kalbi order.

I tried some of the Garlic Ahi, and it was amazing!  Very tender, sushi grade ahi, but with a gorgeous sauce covering it.  Packed with flavor...it was very very good...and I plan to order it next time I am here!

Musubi had too much rice though.  It was like a double decker...with twice the rice needed for an enjoyable musubi.

Gotta be one of the best Hawaiian spots in town :)

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good for hawaiian BBQ. The people who work there/own the restaurant are very friendly."}
{"text":"Miso garlic chicken FTW. So good you have to try it yourself.

Don't get the kahlua pork...if you open that dish next to the miso garlic chicken, it pales in comparison. Literally!  I bought those 2 dishes for me and a friend (me-garlic, friend-pork).  My friend was so sad that their dish looked WAY less tasty. The pork was bland and not too appetizing.

Loco Moco here isn't bad...although I think Baby Stacks has a better one--their dark brown gravy sauce is money.

Decent/average prices. 

Line can be slow sometimes, esp during peak times. They have a slow credit card machine."}
{"text":"Moving from Hawaii my husband and I finally started missing home and it's amazing food. We went to another Hawaiian food place and the food was a 3/10 at best with some not so nice servers. When we came here it was really busy but the staff was friendly and handled the line well (guess they're always busy and I can see why) not only was the food delicious the portion sizes were amazing for their prices. And it also tastes exactly like home from the Kalua pork to the chicken Katsu all the way down to the macaroni salad! Definitely will be coming back for more"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiin food in town hands down!  Took friends and family here, and no one leaves disappointed.  Their Ono chicken is the best you'll get away from the islands."}

Hailing from the Midwest it would be an understatement to say that Hawaiian food was locally underrepresented, and even to this day a search of restaurants close to Northwest Ohio indicates zero serving anything 'Hawaiian' save for the \"Flaming Hawaiian Volcano Roll\" at a particularly sad looking Sushi joint, thus when a patient from the Big Island suggested that the most authentic taste of home she'd found since living in Las Vegas was at 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate on West Craig Road the decision was made to stop in, though a drive of nearly thirty minutes from home made such a thing somewhat laborious.

In reality located in North Las Vegas, a completely different entity from Las Vegas proper to those unfamiliar, and operated by the same family for seven years in a shopping plaza next to Ella Em's Soul Food, 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate is presented as a counter-service concept in which diners are invited to approach a menu hanging at the far end of a lengthy space over a wide window looking into the kitchen, the owner's wife serving as the sole front-of-house staff-member as she pulls triple duty as cashier, server and story-teller, an early arrival before the crowds allowing for plenty of the latter.

Truly a wealth of knowledge as relates to her homeland's history, the 'plantation era' briefly described when explaining Saimin Noodles to the uninitiated, it was with several questions asked and answered that decisions were made from a board that at first seems brief before one really digs into the various offerings for Meats and toppings, the decision to try one mixed plate plus Noodles, an Appetizer, two sweets and a side easily enough food for four, all at the total cost of just under thirty dollars.

Taking a seat in the minimally decorated space, The Food Network displayed  on televisions as diners are left to peruse a flip-card indicating daily specials plus a Brunch menu offered on Sundays, it was after perhaps five minutes that plates one and two were delivered from the kitchen, the aforementioned Egg Noodles pan fried in a slick sauce with Ham and a mix of Cabbage, Radishes and Green Onions, the flavor largely that of light Sesame plus a bit of Ginger while the half-dozen Chicken Wings were twice-fried crisp and medium-hot, the meat on the inside plump with a good seasoning of its own and tender but not greasy.

Offering Chicken in no less than ten styles, a sample of the Garlic version topped in yellow Aioli a bit too pungent while the \"Ono Chicken\" takes the Katsu-style Thigh meat and lightly tosses it in a pan of Garlic, Onions and Oil with outstanding results, the $11.50 \"Mixed Plate\" was completed with a small bowl of shredded Pork and Cabbage next to two big mounds of Rice and a rather flavorless Macaroni Salad, the deep-fried Musubi marrying Hawaii's love of Spam with Spicy Mayonnaise, Unagi Sauce and Furikake in an unexpectedly compelling manner that could change the opinion of many mainlanders as relates to canned Meat.

Told that 808's Pastry Chef, actually the owner's son, was vacationing back home currently, thus leaving only two types of Butter Mochi available for Dessert, it was with one of each that the meal came to an end, the version topped in Blueberries unfortunately quite disappointing with a gummy texture and not much sweetness while the block of sticky Purple Yam proved somewhat better, though certainly not on par with the pies and cakes featured in Social Media, nor the Macadamia Nut Pancakes or Bread Pudding French Toast offered at Brunch.

***1/2: Thriving as a family run eatery in North Las Vegas for almost eight years thanks to a dedicated following of Hawaiians searching for the real thing, 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate is a worthy destination for those seeking something a little different from the big-box Poke stops springing up across the Valley, the prices a genuine bargain for both the quality and the portion sizes even when accounting for the gallon or so of gas it will take most Las Vegans to get there."}
{"text":"We ordered the fried rice plate with Portuguese sausage and da 808 plate which is a mixed plate which we got furikake chicken and kalbi. So the food was really good. The flavors were different but in a good way. The fried rice was a bit too oyster saucey for me. The furikake chicken was tasty but came in small pieces. Our total was about $30 which is pricey. But like I said it was tasty I'd come back but I'd probably just do a single it plate."}
{"text":"On a wednesday afternoon, lunch break, I had the garlic chicken miso mayo large for 7.78 (10% military discount)

- VA friendly! if you work there, you get the 10% off.
- Safe for a lunch break. It takes 15min just to get there. EAT fast.
- Cute little hawaiian kid opens the door for me and welcomes me in. nice service!
- Timing is everything. ready quick! about 7min. 
- 2 rice scoops, 1 mac salad scoop, and the chicken.
- miso mayo is great! love the flavor. good after taste. KISSS! garlic :)
- HAWAIIAN appettite fail. small portion. no doggie bag? I actually finished ALL my food.
- Overall, great taste and friendly service. The chef actually patted my back and asked if I liked the food..lol. 
- Would be 5 if more chicken. cmon..."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Hawaiian restaurant that I've been to.  The food is very tasty and it's close to home.  It's in the same shopping complex as Poke Express.  Hawaiian goodness in one area!

We got there to place a to-go order.  I'm not sure why I didn't call to place my order but oh well.  The kalbi takes 20 minutes but it was soooo worth the wait.  It was juicy, tender, a bit fatty and the flavor was great.  The Spam musubi was alright - it had a bit too much rice though.  The garlic chicken was also good, lightly breaded but it wasn't as garlicky as I would have liked.  Good thing I also got the GARLIC AHI - it was sooooo good.  The fish was fresh and the flavor was AMAZING.  It was topped with toasted garlic.  Easily, the best item on their menu!  

Their portions are generous.  I wanted to finish my food but it was just too much.  I'll keep coming back for more garlic ahi though.  Yes, it's THAT good!"}
{"text":"Family and I ordered the fried noodles, meat jhun, shoyu poke bowl and musubis. Everything tasted really good...the fried noodles reminded me of the kind you get from the manapua truck. Staff was friendly and the sitting area was clean. Only downside is that we live in Henderson and this place is about 35 minutes away. Glad we tried it and we will surely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!! Thank you Aunty Eunice!!

This was an awesome find through Yelp when I visited Vegas in July. If any locals from Hawaii are craving a good taste from the islands... Here it is! My friend lived here for more than a year and missed Korean fried chicken. She loved the taste of it here. Totally bright her back to the Big Island. 

Really a must try- you walk in and already feel the Aloha!"}
{"text":"Real authentic Hawaiian food. Been trying to find one ever since I went to the mainland. 
Best one I have found! 
Really feels like home"}
{"text":"I love the Garlic chicken and I have been here many times for it and I asked for an extra sauce for my chicken like I have before and they charged me a full dollar for an extra 2 oz. sauce for the garlic chicken when I have never had to pay that before. I did feel bad for complaining to the worker because she doesn't make the prices. It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"UPDATE:::::

I went in to order today and was approached by the friendliest person!! We were waiting in line, and he came all the way from the back kitchen to speak to me.. He asked if I wrote the review, I told him yes and we just talked about the food and if it wasn't to my liking etc.. I NEVER thought these reviews were even read by anyone until today! It was a good feeling knowing that my review was actually read and taking into accountability.. 

We ordered 4 different plates and they were all superb! The food tasted like how it use too!! I am just so impressed with the customer service, food and the caring of the customers!!! Get to this place for lunch or dinner and I promise you are in for a treat!!"}
{"text":"Wow ! Food is extremely delicious . We order take out over the phone at 8:40 PM and they close at 9 and they were very kind enough to take our order . The lady taking our order was very patient with us in which we were still very indecisive. We got there shortly after and the place was completely empty because they were about to close , so it was so nice of them to still accommodate our take out order

We order the garlic bento , 808 mixed plate with kalbi ribs and garlic chicken , a regular misubi and a fried misubi. Man was it delicious . It was way more than enough food for two people and we have have way more than enough left overs for tomorrow.

Additionally , this restaurant is one the few 5 star places that is offered on restaurants.com . So if anybody is like me and is a huge foodie, but loves to save , this is the place to chose. We had the spend 30 , pay $15 voucher off restaurants.com and with everything we ordered, it put us at just about $15.00 . 

What a steal !! 

This place is definitely worth the try . Very friendly staff as well , to say the least. Thanks 808 for the delicious dinner"}
{"text":"Great food! They will go over menu items if you have any questions. About 10 tables to sit at. Very clean restaurant, friendly staff but a little pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious. I had the mixed plate with Sesame Chicken and Chicken Katsu. Had enough sauce on the Sesame but wasnt over powering. The Katsu came with big pieces with a nice mayo type sauce i never had before. Reasonably priced and i left full. I didnt have the Spam Musubi but it looked fresh. Spam isnt my forte though. The waitress comes around to check on you. And you feel like family when your in there. I will go back there again."}
{"text":"Oh garlic seared ahi, how I love thee. The mini portion is just the right size; one scoop of rice, one scoop of mac or green salad, and some slices of beautifully cooked fish is all I need. ACTUALLY! I need that wasabi butter mixture. I mixed it with the rice, I dipped the fish in there, I fished out all the delicious morsels that fell in, I might have drank it if I did not fear for my waistline. 

I am impressed with places that ask you how you want your protein cooked. No, I am not talking about fine dining or a steak house. I mean everyday places that can be mistaken for fast food. Yes, I do want my ahi cooked to a medium rare. Yes, I do understand that it will be raw in the middle. Yes, I would love to see that the medium rare I ordered was cooked to perfection. Not only was my meal prepared well, but a friend's kalbi was pretty amazing as well.They are thick cuts of tender meat and I LOVE picking at the bones. The marinade was sweet and savory. Just the perfect mix and it had me wishing I ordered my own plate. My only gripe is with the spam musubi. There is just too much rice and a tiny slice of spam. I want more! Once I get past that. I am a happy camper."}
{"text":"Went and had the garlic chicken and it was all right.  I would have preferred it to be more garlicky but it was not bad.  The only thing that turned me off was that the prices are kind of expensive for the amount of food they give you.  They put a small mound of rice under the meat portion to plump it up and make it look like you're getting a lot.  Also personally, it turns me off (from eating) when employees have extremely large gauged ears and tattoos all up their necks and arms.  Call me old school, but it is not what I want to see when dining."}
{"text":"Hawaiian food is fast food...it's meant to be in, boom, and out. I ordered a single Loco Moco and watched 3 whole episodes of Chopped on the wall TV and my food still wasnt ready. On top of that, I looked around at the other 3 people in the restaurant and they too were still waiting."}
{"text":"I went to 808 mix plate 8/25/17 cause I was told it had great reviews so I was very excited . The restaurant has a casual feel which is nice the staff was very friendly which is great make you feel very welcome. But the food was disappointed that I don't know if I came after a rush of something but they were out of the kula pig and cabbage which is  okay I understand so I order the BBQ chicken and the Ona Chicken BBQ was not bad pretty tasty but the ONA Chicken was not good it didn't taste fresh at all it seem like the fried it earlier that day and instead of throwing it away they decided to fried it again and served it . It was so over cooked it was hard it was very disappointing especially how far we came to try something new"}
{"text":"Favorite Hawaiian food restaurant in Vegas! Love their Ono chicken, garlic chicken, & deep fried spam musubis. Now they have adobo omlette which we usually drive to Aloha Kitchen for. Excited to try it! Their food is always fresh & flavors are spot on."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Don't believe the hype on the short ribs, but believe I paid $42.00 for two mix plates and 2 spam musubis. Place also had a weird smell and is not very clean. I Wish this place the best in what they do, but I will not consider it if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"The garlic chicken is sooooooo ono!!! Deep fried spam musubi is good too! So much to choose from! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Out running around today and my husband and I decided we wanted a plate lunch.  We always seem to be on Craig road, so sure enough when we spoke of our craving, we both said out loud, 808 mixed plate!  And we headed there right away.

Todays special was the Mahi mahi plate.  It was very good with a sesame drizzle and green onions. Two scoops of rice, and mac salad.  I enjoyed the meal, and the staff were friendly, you can tell they make their food with the aloha spirit."}
{"text":"Back again...it's been a while but anyway--this visit we ordered mini loco Moco and shoyu chicken, and a reg BBQ chicken plate.  Total was $22...we were smart and called in ahead 20 min for our food because if you've dined here before you know how long it takes.  Food was good, still as I remember.  Still 3 stars because service is still hit and miss - plus tonight they ran out of Teri beef, lomi salmon...and no desserts.  Will prob return if ever in the area but def not somewhere I'd make a special trip to.  Suggestion: turn your soda machine around so people can help themselves to their own drinks.  It will allow you more time to service your ordering customers.  Also you should have a permanent dessert menu and put what you offer on a menu....see pics on Facebook but when we go there we don't see any advertisement of desserts."}
{"text":"I love their hula pack with sesame chicken! If I'm on that side of town and they are open I will stop by."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooooo goooooood. The only complaint I have about this place is that they close too early. Otherwise, the food is spectacular, the prices are good for such a large amount of food, and the customer service is excellent. Will miss this place greatly when I move out of the North."}
{"text":"This is handsdown the best Hawaiian food in Las Vegas friendly staff good food,the \"ono chicken\" highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is the best place for the kalbi short ribs in Las Vegas even it is on market price and doesn't open for Monday! 

We ordered raw for short ribs, they have marinated short ribs by themselves, they also have the right thickness for the ribs, so it won't be too dry when it is done grilling. In addition, they gave us some sample for their other famous dish. Omg!! This is a place has the best Hawaiian food and people in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Never eaten in, but always get take out or Uber eats. I've yet to be disappointed. The fried spam masubi is the best!"}
{"text":"I rarely believe any restaurant deserves more than 5 stars, but this hole in the wall place has elevated Hawaiian to a new level and for affordable prices.  Yelp, can we give this place the sixth star?! They do all the classic Hawaiian dishes and they do them well.  What sets this place apart is the creativity of the new dishes that are constantly being created by the chef. He adds a little finesse to your normal Hawaiian dishes, creating innovative masterpieces.  

A little background, the chef hails from Hawaii but worked at a Japanese/French inspired restaurant in LA before coming to Vegas.  He has also spent time in Alan Wong's restaurant in Hawaii being inspired by the pastry chef.  I mean this guy comes with some definite restaurant cred.  This isn't your uncle from the island just whipping up a few home cooked dishes.  He combines his culinary background with inspiration he finds from restaurants all over.

Some of his most recent creations that I've fallen in love with....

1. Firecracker chicken - think chicken fried to a crispy perfection with a hint of sweetness, covered with sriracha mayo sauce.  I swear I have never eaten a dry piece of chicken here.
2.  Ono chicken - another deep fried chicken but with a sweet and spicy Korean sauce and sprinkled with furikake.  I love that sometimes there are just straight up fried pieces of chicken skin mixed in. Don't worry there's enough chicken to feed an army, the skin is just a bonus.
3. Hurricane fries - I will eat myself into obesity with these fries and not even feel bad about it.  I ordered these as part of my pre-wedding meal, that's how serious I am!  Crispy french fries covered in  butter, garlic, parmesan, furikake. Don't tell anyone but sometimes I eat the seasoning by itself that's left at the bottom of the bowl...think crumbs at the bottom of the chip bag scene.
4. Seared furikake ahi with sriracha mayo sauce - grilled just the way you want it!  I get it lightly seared on both sides and this literally melts in my mouth.

These are just some of my favorites available on the menu full time.  The best part is that the menu is ever evolving with new creations: honey mustard chicken, honey butter chicken, salt and pepper ahi, misoyaki butterfish, lemon butter mani mahi, mac nut crunch bars, pumpkin crunch, lilikoi chiffon cake, guava cake...the list is honestly endless.  The chef puts out the specials and gauges the popularity and incorporates the winners into his regular menu.  The best part is going at night, they are a little slower during this time, and he has even more refined dishes on the special dinner menu.  

They also do catering, so definitely something to consider for parties or any other get together.  I love the ohana (family) vibe you get when you walk in.  The aunties always welcome us with a big smile.

I also mentioned to the chef he should do a pop up dinner to show his true culinary prowess....I hope he takes my suggestion seriously ;) Put my name down for the first reservation!"}
{"text":"Yes missing Matiki (Cypress, CA) so I thought give this a try. Its good however missed the mark for me. Staff was warm and friendly but hands down if youre in Cali hit up Matiki and say hi to Auntie!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Hawaiian restaurant on this side of town. This spot is a part of DreamTrips Local so don't forget to show your DreamTrips app to receive points and a free soda! Everything you order here is delicious and we love the staff!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat at in North Las Vegas. The food is amazing and the staff is great. They know what my wife and I want to order each time. Always a great time."}
{"text":"Not making this long, but I've found coming here in recent times disappointing. It feels like they are sulking in and taking advantage of the fact they are busier. Everything seems so much more expensive, MP (market price) is apparently the new price, and the spirit in there isn't Aloha. While it does depend on staff members...I was always afraid they'd come to this. We'd frequent here when they were just starting out. It felt personable, food quality and price made sense, but now...the inflation of price to value...it's not even worthed anymore. It no longer tastes as good as it used to. Not everyone uderstands that market price deal, so seeing it is easily a turn off. We aren't in a high end restaurant. Even back home in Hawaii you'll get a blunt price especially in terms of kalbi. Seafood MP I get. But kalbi? =/

Our last visit really left a bummed and empty feeling...which is a reminder as to why we no longer frequent here. Safe to say, we will no longer come here...we just cant. But I don't want to take away the fact that they do have tasty items on their menu...just the value is no longer something we feel is worthed."}
{"text":"Small-ish location & busy on Saturday night. We had a party of 6, 4 eating. The kalua pork & cabbage was good. The bowls were good. Mac salad was alright. Spam musubi wasn't quite fried enough for me, but my kids wolfed it down. Hunny ordered the short ribs and got wickedly sick. Would be 3 stars, but the girl at the counter told us they were out of saimin, then served the next family that came in after us 2 bowls of saimin. Kind of disappointing. There's good Hawaiian food in Vegas - we'll keep looking!"}
{"text":"Love the late I plates and sauce  and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good food at reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Middle of a plaza, small but AMAZING food!! I got their garlic shrimp special (please make it permanent) yumm!!!! Shrimp was not gummy just perfect flavor and their Mac is homemade. Plus they give military discount..  Go see them"}
{"text":"I fell in love with some of the traditional Hawaiian plate lunch establishments last year on the Big Island.  Great amounts of food, cooked with love and made with local ingredients, for dirt cheap prices.

So while it is cool that Vegas has tons of plate lunch restaurants, I haven't been happy with any of them.  And this includes the well reviewed ones like Rice Trax, Island Flavor, Ross J's, L & L, and many of the others.  The food is universally very fatty and low quality (to make a lower price point) and for the most part have destroyed my stomach.

But then I tried 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate and I was in heaven and it brought me back to all those great little places on the Big Island.  This place is truely a gem.  Food cooked with love and actual skill, great ingredients, and people that give a shit about what they put in front of you.

Everything I have tried has been excellent.  Pork, chicken, beef, fish, they do it all well.  And they don't think it's weird when I ask to substitute rice - in this case they only have salad.  But what a great salad it is - fresh greens (not iceburg), tomato, cucumber, carrot, and homemade dressing that tastes similar to balsamic but something more complex.  

This gem is definitely worth driving across town for when you're in the mood for a plate lunch.  It will seriously make you wish you were back in Hawaii, and you'll find yourself planning your next vacation there while you're eating."}
{"text":"I ALWAYS got to come here whenever in town. Love their freindly service and the loco moco. I've tried their other dishes but can't seem to get away from deciding on loco moco :P Fair price for the serving you get of food you don't find everywhere. Highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong, come 808 mix plate. 
Garlic chicken is my favorite here. Whenever I want to eat local food this place is the first thing on my mind living on the north side of town. Great food, not fast food remember that! Lol."}
{"text":"When I first moved out to LV, one my staff doctors recommended checking out 808 for lunch. Turns out the docs go here every Friday, it's their weekly ritual. My friends and I decided to check it out for ourselves and we love it. I recommend ordering ahead of time online or by phone, the line can get long here. Here are a few of my favorite dishes:

[1] Deep fried spam musubi - their musubi is legit here, the traditional spam musubi (deep fried of course), topped with sriracha mayo drizzle and furikake... so good. [2] 808 Mixed plate - this is my favorite plate to order, you get rice, two of any lunch plate item, and a side of salad or mac salad. [3] Katsu Chicken - tastes just like Hawaii, crispy panko on the outside, and tender thigh meat on the inside. [4] Garlic Chicken - one of the favorites here at 808, I'm always nervous about having garlic breath and seeing patients, but it's totally worth it! Legit Hawaiian spot and great for lunch in North Vegas."}
{"text":"DAMN - I did thoroughly enjoy my food here!  

I am not sure why but I Love Hawaiian BBQ, even though I have to use spell check just to spell \"Hawaiian.\"  

I had the garlic chicken.  A healthy portion of fried boneless chicken thighs topped with a mayonnaise based sauce. (I had to spell check mayonnaise too --- 2 \"n's\")  It was crispy, juicy, and tasty!  The dash of sesame seeds was a nice touch.  I tasted a hint of sesame oil, too.   Then of course 2 scoops of rice and mac salad.  It was all good!

I like this place.  It is family owned.  Prices are about average."}
{"text":"The Ninth Island.
It's a nickname for Las Vegas because over 90,000 former residents of Hawaii now call Sin City home.  And because of that, we are lucky to have several options for onolicious eats in the Vegas Valley and 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate is one of my favorites.  First of all, it's near our house, which is always a plus.
Secondly, the food is delicious.  Thirdly, the staff always displays the aloha spirit with their customers.  
I've had the furikake chicken, garlic chicken, Spam musubi, and Kalbi short ribs, all tasty every time.  The portions are generous and I usually need to take some food home because I can't finish everything in one sitting.  
If you are a fan of food from Hawaii, 808 HMP's menu offers you lots of options: saimin, Kalua Pork and Cabbage, mahi mahi, Loco Moco, breakfast served all day, and more.  Get some ono grindz here the next time you want a taste of the islands."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while when I need really Amazing Hawaiian food that never lets me down"}
{"text":"This place has raving reviews so I had to come try it when I went back to Vegas. My boyfriend and I came here on a Monday night for take out, and even though it's a Mon night, there were still a few group of people there. 

We ordered the hurricane fries (because i freaking love hurricane popcorns), fried spam musubi, garlic chicken/beef plate, and loco moco/katsu plate. I originally ordered the short ribs, but they ran out that night! Which is fine because everything else was sooo yummy. 

The wait was about 15 minutes or so. They actually also sell hawaiian mochi bread on the side, they let me sample a bite and i actually really liked it LOL. So if you want something sweet on the side i recommend that you get a piece. 

now the food. the food was absolutely AMAZING. The portion is BIG (2 full scoop of rice and lotsss of meat!) and definitely will fill you up, and the food was full of flavor. I was throughout impressed with how yummy it was actually. I love going to L&L, aloha kitchen and all that stuff but i think this place was on another level. I also love their macaroni/potato salad. 

I am not from Hawai'i but, I would like to say that I know a little bit about all the asian food out there and this place is definitely one of the best! Loved it."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Hawaii and we have been looking for a good Hawaiian food place for a long time- not the generic, (owned by people that are not from Hawaii) \"L&L, or Ono's\" - they don't understand what local food is supposed to look and taste like! We have been looking for local food that is currently being served in Hawaii, but here on the mainland- well, we hit the jackpot!!! This place is so good, we would probably eat here 3 times a week if we lived in Vegas!!! The chef is a gourmet chef from Hawaii and \"gets it\" - he's on top of what's happening now and makes it with a gourmet touch- We would eat here if it were IN Hawaii!!! - seriously fresh and tasty - not generic or over greasy, and they live up to their name \"mix plate\" - which is hard to find in some so called \"Hawaiian food\" places! You can mix just about any thing on the menu! - now that's real Hawaiian style!! - also, they make their own desserts!!! if they have it, you must get the \"Haupia square\" - its probably the best dessert we have ever had! And we are foodies!!! - If you crave good Hawaiian local food, you must try this place!!! - Aloha!!"}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian food in Las Vegas, who would have thought such amazing food could be found in the Mohave desert."}
{"text":"Ordered the mixed plate. Kalbi beef ribs and firecracker chicken. Ribs were 80% fat and firecracker chicken tastes just like orange chicken from panda express... wouldn't recommend based on my experience"}
{"text":"LOVE the kaluha pig wit cabbage. My fav!!  I also got the garlic chicken and that miso mayo sauce is so delish!!  Their macaroni salad is one of my favorites compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Aloha North Vegas Yelpers!

This is the closest place to me that offers local food.
I had a late lunch here last week with my guy. We both come from Hawaii and love local food.

I had the kaukau pack which is their version of a bento. I choose garlic ahi and sesame chicken. It comes with white rice and fried noodles. Great taste and reasonable price costing $8

My guy loves the korean chicken plate and Portuguese sausage here.
To me their version of Korean chicken is OKAY... I would suggest something else... like their garlic ahi!

Why -1 star?
super long wait... really long wait... did I mention there's a wait? 
and the menu is limited but I'm ok with quality, not quantity. 
I guess I wish there was more HAWAIIAN food on the menu, I say this is more of local food from Hawaii. I guess I had my share of other Hawaiian spots in the city, so I've been to places that has more variety.

This place reminds me of a place you would find in Hawaii. Very friendly staff! I love Hawaii people! One lady there reminds me of my grandma back home. Gotta love the aloha spirit!

Will I come back?
YES!
I'll probably call in my order a head of time to cut out the wait, now that I have their menu.

+ military drinks free! Indoor seating. Super Casual. Lots of free parking.

Mahalo 808 MP!

{"text":"Constantly make the trip across Vegas for great Hawaiian food!"}
{"text":"Garlic chicken=omg delicious!

If you're tired of the typical chicken katsu, I suggest you try the garlic chicken! It's mouthwateringly amazing.

Service is always great and the workers are quite friendly and nice. I have never had a bad experience here regardless of whether or not I ate in or got togo."}
{"text":"The Boyfriend and I were looking for a quick and fun lunch date in North Vegas and I came across 808 on Yelp. I was very disappointed in this place for so many reasons, the first being the short but rediculously SLOW line at the register. Upon reaching the register, the midget-girl working the register had a rude attitude and was wearing oversized mens shoes, as she told me the short ribs I wanted to order would take 20-30 minutes because as she put it \"there are a lot of food orders ahead of you\", which translated into a big fat F U. Uhm, OK.....if I wanted to wait half an hour to eat I would've stayed home and cooked! Lame. So I ordered the Kahlua pork and my BF ordered the garlic chicken. 

Someone's nice grandma in house slippers delivered my lunch to the table. Just my plate. Call me crazy, but when two people sit down to eat, it's nice to have your meals brought out together, not 15 minutes apart. It really detracted from the whole date part of our lunch. Having all that time to sit there and look around the place, it was pretty disorganized and dirty. I felt bad for dragging the BF to this crap hole for lunch when we dont get that much time together as it is. I didn't care for the pork, so I didn't eat it, the Mac salad was good, and BF liked his chicken. 

Yeah, won't be going back. Yuck."}

(I stay drooling ova' my keyboard reminiscing about that lunch... *sigh)

Like most local Hawaiian kine places, very low-key, no frills, simple... 'With ono kaukau. (\"good food\")

Wasn't too crowded. I was surprised that they did not offer KERNS PoG - Passion Orange Guava, a local staple. (shrugs) Whateva', no worries! 

Great plaza - Plate lunch & poke?!... 'No can lose bruddah!!

{"text":"I recently changed jobs and now I'm in this area, so of course I Yelp near by places. That's when I see 808 and the reviews. I've been craving a decent Loco Moco for awhile now. Well I found it! The gravy had a great taste,  the patties were real with onion in them (could use some more seasonings) and well in size, rice cooked all the way, egg was a perfect over easy. Portion size was big, couldn't eat all of it. I also got the macaroni salad as a side, it was a bit dry to me I like it a little more saucy but it tasted good. I will be back for more and other things."}
{"text":"Super boooomb... Garlic chicken on point also the bbq beef is real good awesome flavor. Glad i live so close. I say order online that way you really dont have to wait you can be in and out."}
{"text":"I've had this place on my radar for quite some time but I could never get off my okole to drive up to North Vegas to try this place out. Luckily one day we were up in the neighborhood doing errands and this made a perfect opportunity..

I ordered a combo Kalbi & Garlic Chicken plate and the GF ordered the 808 mixed plate. 

I was a little taken by surprise when they asked me how I wanted my Kalbi cooked. Bewildered I said medium-rare? 
When my plate came out I understood why...
Kalbi steak action! The Kalbi was sliced thick and filleted like a steak!  A welcome change from the usual 1/4\" ones your get everywhere else. My kalbi steak was ono! 

Their garlic chicken is different than what we all expect when we order it. It comes with this white garlic/mayo crack sauce on it. Onolisish anyways..

The 808 mixed plate is a good value. Nothing too crazy here: SPAM, teri beef and a choice of chicken. She got the sesame chicken which was onolish. 
I know it sounds stupid but the star of the plate is the fried noodles. It reminds me manapua mans noodles back home. 

I dig the food here but for me it's just too far for me to frequent all of the time but at least I know where to get local grindz when I'm up in North Vegas."}
{"text":"I was really looking at trying something here since I had just picked up some Poke a few doors down.
Walked in and as I approached the counter the lady behind said they are closed. Had almost a full house still but I left since I understand people want to get home after a long day at work.
I glanced at the Sunday times that they are open on the front door and it said until 4:30 today.
Glanced at my iPhone and it read 4:27pm.
Just asking, should restaurants take food orders if they are still open?
I hope the food is good since I didn't feel the Hawaiian spirit."}
{"text":"I've never had anything so disgusting in my life.  The chicken was all fat... If that was chicken.  The beef was a weird and discolored."}
{"text":"Two words: Garlic chicken. Try it, won't be disappointed. Even got it catered for a birthday party. 

The service is awesome too. Make you feel welcomed"}
{"text":"Sesame chicken plate you can go no wrong. Sticky rice on point, pan fried sesame chicken and probably the best mac salad in the ninth island...Just too bad that this place is at the outer reaches of sin city civilization..."}
{"text":"Good local grindz, and close to the house too. Staff is super friendly, and very attentive to drinks and (with kids) messes.  _Prices are reasonable.  Can't beat that.

Wife had garlic chicken, she loved it. Kids always get spam musubi (when they order it, they pronounce it 'MOO-su-bi') and Saimin.  This was the first time I tried the Zippy's special, chili rice with hot dog. This chili is dang good, highly recommended. Rumor has it malasadas are coming, so we're patiently waiting. A shave ice machine wouldn't hurt too ;)"}
