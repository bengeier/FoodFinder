{"text":"The food is excellent. There is a wait but that is because the food is cooked fresh. Depending on who is working the counter the portion sizes can vary but the steamed fish, escovitch fish and cutesy goat are savory and delicious. The rice and peas are also good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a whole in the wall good for take out caribbean/Jamaican food. It would be nice if they played some nice caribbean music instead of loud rap music. The oxtail is awesome worth a try. The brown stew chicken a bit greasy and jerk chicken spicy just the way I like it. Great find in Pittsburgh and pleasant surprise"}
{"text":"I have been looking for true Caribbean food and boy it seems I had a hard time until I read this write up about Leons !!!

{"text":"I finally made it!!! Let me tell you, this is some of the best food I ever ate in Pittsburgh and I eat everywhere. #leons #caribbeanrestaurant is top notch grade A food.  This Ox Tail tastes like they flew it in.  The cabbage is cooked to perfection and the cornbread, lord Jesus the cornbread... It has a carrot cake taste that's out of this world.  I was going to get Classic jerk chicken and the bro came out with a piece of Ox Tail for a sampling and I immediately changed my order.  The greatest part is I shook Leon's actual hand.  I'm proud to say I met him.  We talked about #MCMstudios and different topics till I made my way.  I promised him not only would I be back, but I'd send everyone I knew there.  It's located right in the thriving revival neighborhood that is Arlington Pittsburgh.  Go there, this is THE real deal. #pittsburghfood #imsoburgh #leonscaribbean #islandfood the pic does the smell and flavor and look no justice."}
{"text":"Walking in, you'll notice this is a hole in the wall takeout joint. It's simple, doesn't try to misrepresent and just plain good. I have tasted the jerk chicken, shrimp and the curry chicken and shrimp and stewed chicken. All of the food has been amazing and the portions are huge, definitely more than 1 meal in each container.  There are a few seats if you want to dine in.

Parking is only on the street but the wait for an open spot is never too long. Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Came here with an island friend to get a taste of my first Jerk Chicken! As a first timer, I loved it! But what's even more is my friend, who is from the Carribean, could compare to original island food and LOVED it! The chicken patti was also so yumm and amazing! Defiantly a hidden gem for authentic, home style, delicious Carribean food in Pittsburg:)!"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken meal and Jerk wings are unreal. Fall off the bone and the flavor is out of this world. I usually find rice pointless to eat but the rice and peas that come with the jerk chicken meal is awesome.  Also comes with cornbread and cabbage that is killer. Order here NOW."}
{"text":"Leon's is no fuss, but don't let that deter you. Walk in, and you'll see two modest tables and counter seating. Most likely, hip hop or rap is blaring. Not a shred of pretense.
I waited 1 hour for an order of Oxtail Stew, with absolutely NO regrets. It had me gnawing on bones (like a lady, of course), hungry for every last bite,
The food is the reason this place has won over so many loyal fans. Delicious, worth-waiting-for food. Spiced to absolute perfection, I could not be happier with my meal here. The guy even threw me a piece of the delicious bread (which honestly tastes like coffee cake, but pairs extraordinarily well with the savory/spicy fare) while I was waiting.
If you like well-spiced, savory, delectable food, you absolutely MUST try Leon's!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my jerk chicken although i am not a big fan of cabbage. Don't think i liked it enough to go back"}
{"text":"Reminded me of home at st Kitts and Nevis . The jerk sauce was just delicious with authentic spicyness and taste . I got the jerk lunch with beans rice and cabbage and everything was just delicious . And those chicken patties are to die for . He was out of ting unfortunately . A true homely experience ."}
{"text":"As authentic as you can get in Pittsburgh. The jerk chicken is the perfectly spicy. The pepper steak is delicious as well. Peas and rice were well seasoned and complimented the meat nicely."}
{"text":"Great Jerk chicken comparable to the spots I ate in Jamaica (I ate it 7 days in a row on vacation).  Large portions and amazing flavor. The rice, beans and cabbage are a very good compliment to the chicken.  FYI the jerk wings are phenomenal. I stop in about every other week it's so good"}
{"text":"Just picked up some A jerk chicken dinner at Leon's Caribbean  restaurant . Great food great prices and good people."}
{"text":"Ordered: Large jerk chicken, Large oxtail stew
Price: $23.54 w/o tip

Ambiance: The place is very barebones with minimal decorations and only 2 tables for dining in. They were playing rap music in the background and the cashier flipped between singing the lyrics, struggling with his iPad, and taking my order. It also didn't help he seemed impaired by some substance or other because he was mumble-slurring his words and difficult to understand. To their credit however, the place seemed clean and the server genuinely seemed proud of the food when he gave it to us, saying to remember where the food came from, to enjoy it, and to come back some time.

Food: The oxtails were a smidge dry (happens when cooked at too high a temp) but the flavor was rich and savory. A large portion had maybe 4 larger bones with 4-5 smaller tail bones and most of the pieces were tender enough. The jerk chicken carried a good amount of heat (coming from a spice fiend) but the strongest notes were the allspice and cloves. A little more soy and maybe some coriander would've given it more earthy body to round it out. The rice and boiled veges were perfectly cooked and not too mushy although I'm always sad when there are no fried plantains included like other places I've been.

Overall I thought the food was good but not something I'll seek out again.  There are better meals in the city that actually offer a dining experience, are better executed, and aren't as shady for a similar price."}
{"text":"I feel sad to have to downgrade my previous review.  Per Valentine's Day tradition, we celebrated with ALLLL the takeout from Leon's.  I ordered for pickup and my food was ready for me half an hour later, smelling delicious.  What'd we get this year?

ESCOVITCHED SNAPPER:  I didn't order this.  I ordered the BROWN STEW FISH, but ended up with this instead.  Which wouldn't have been terrible except that it was SUPER dry and we didn't enjoy it...at all.  The snappers they use are already on the small side (like 1/4 inch thick fillets), so they definitely need to be cooked in some sauce.  The brown stew gravy is normally perfect.

OXTAIL STEW: A knockout, per usual.  Rich, fall off the bone, with beautiful bits of tendon.

JERK CHICKEN: No complaints here, our small order came with 4 big, saucy pieces of tender chicken meat.

ESCOVITCHED WINGS:  Ordered this to try something new.  The wings came topped with vegetables, which weren't our favorite flavor.  I mean, they were wings, so they weren't bad, but we vastly preferred the jerk chicken.  I guess the escovitched style just isn't for us, taste and moisture-wise.  We're saucy people.

While we still had a great meal, I was deeply disappointed by the fish mix-up, as this was my favorite dish previously.  But I suppose there are much bigger disappointments to be had on Valentine's Day, so cheers to an otherwise successful date night."}
{"text":"Delicious. I ordered the curry chicken which comes with cabbage and beans/rice. I wasn't excited for the cabbage but honestly it was delicious. The chicken curry was also good.

My fiance ordered the ox tail. He also enjoyed it.

Service was amazing and portion sizes were huge. Shop is a legit hole in the wall but the food, service & portion sizes make up for it"}
{"text":"On a good day, Leon's has top notch Carribean food. The jerk chicken is to die for--every single piece is smoked perfectly, and the meat is so tender that it literally falls off the bone. The spiciness was also a surprising kick. They don't hold back on the spices! Which is a big reason that everything is so tasty here. Other good choices we tried here were the oxtail and curry goat, both of which, though bony by nature, came with a lot of meat and just as seasoned. Portions are overall pretty big, and rice and beans make a good side. Just don't come in too late, since the one time we did they ran out of rice and some of their entrees!"}
{"text":"I had the peppersteak meal this evening and absolutely loved it. Comes with a piece of bread flavored with cinnamon, cabbage, and a generous serving of rice. Also had the chicken patty. The chicken party had good flavor and dough was likely filo dough. Ratio of chicken and dough was not what I had expected, with there being more dough than filling. Since the pastry looked as if it had puffed up and opened during cooking, some filling may have came out. I would be willing to try a beef one though."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef patties, brown sauce chicken, jerk wings, and curry chicken.  All were delicious.  Unfortunately,  because I arrived after 6:30 pm a couple of the dishes I ordered were substitutes (wanted to try the chicken patties and jerk pork; but they were out). I bought the last beef patties and was nervous they would be dry. They weren't.  The dough still had a velvety texture and the meat was seasons well.   I have a mild tolerance for heat, so the jerk wings were too spicy for me. The more heat tolerable members of my family were more than happy to eat my share.  I would go back for huge bowls of the rice and beans.  So good. The cabbage on the side was also very tasty.
Parking was difficult and the street difficult to navigate.  I plan to go back, because there are more items I want to try. 
Only reason I didn't rate this a 5 is that I desire a more welcoming atmosphere. I figured it was due to them being busy (phone orders were also coming in, along with the 3 orders being placed before mine)."}
{"text":"Awesome \"hole-in-the-wall\" spot.  If you're ever craving jerk, come here.  They have a small dining area, maybe 4-6 tables.  I opted to take-out though."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and have enjoyed it both times. It takes like its made out of someone's kitchen. The first time I ordered a large portion of the jerk chicken and this time I ordered the small portion of the Stew Chicken. Both I would recommend. it comes with a side of cabbage and rice and beans. you get a more than decent size meal with the large portion. The small portion is just right. They use just the right amount of seasoning so its not too salty. The bread served with it as well is soooo good. Cant wait to try the shrimp next."}
{"text":"Good oxtail meal. Tasty and authentic, the location is not really a sit down and eat type place. The food was reheated but still good, I enjoyed the food and the friendliness for the owner."}
{"text":"I've been to Leon's a handful of times for lunch. It's definitely a lunchtime favorite at work. We used to go to the Northside for Jamaican food before we found this place. 

The prices are reasonable. You can get a lunch special for $6 of either curry chicken, brown stew chicken or jerk chicken. I've only ever had the curry chicken and it was great. I've had the jerk wings and they were very spicy and I typically like spicy. 

I've also had the curry goat. Not the best. It needed to cook for a little longer because the meat didn't really fall off the bone. Some pieces were actually a little tough to get off the bone. My mother in law makes the best curry goat so I'm a little biased!"}
{"text":"I don't think the food tastes that good. Yea, the price is nice and the food will fill you up but it doesn't taste good. I thought this is one of this neighborhood joints that had amazing food, but.. Nope."}
{"text":"I've had the oxtail and curry goat. The goat was way better--more flavorful, tender and spicy. The oxtail was actually bland but still tender. This place has zero ambiance. They might as well just go full take-out. Portion sizes are good however then skimp on the oxtail. Rice and peas are good. Cabbage is okay. Definitely will go back considering Pittsburgh hardly has any Jamaican spots. Looking forward to trying more dishes. They accept Apple Pay so that's definitely a big plus. And expect the usual Jamaican customer service--meaning it's nonexistent."}
{"text":"Food was very inexpensive and they don't skimp on the portions. Had the curry goat with rice and peas, and cabbage. It was delicious. My boyfriend's mother makes hers a little more spicy but I like spicy food. Over all food was well seasoned and I'll definitely be back for more since my Jamaican mother in law lives 5 hrs away lol"}
{"text":"We ordered pickup, our meal was ready by the time we arrived. The resturant was clean, open allowing you a glimpse into the kitchen, staff were friendly, but most importantly the food was out of this world Good. The brown stew chicken with red beans and rice platter was a well prepared. The chicken was fall-off the bone, flavorful and tasted even better the next day (left overs). We also ordered chicken patties- by far the best I've had in the city since moving to Pittsburgh. This place is a must."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I had the jerk shrimp and it did not disappoint.  My husband had the jerk chicken and was also happy with his choice.  My son doesn't really like spicy food so we got him the fried wings and they were perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  This isn't the first time we've ate at Leon's but I always forgot to write a review.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just ate there today and I bought 2 plates of Oxtail! 1 to go and they only charge $12 bucks! Where Im from In houston Your getting taxed almost 20 dollars!! This place is the truth even though it is small"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch - grabbed the oxtail stew and a meat patty (meat pie).  First time having oxtail, but the meat was buttery and delicious, came right off the bone.  Nice serving size on the small.  I recommend the cabbage and carrots side.  I got it over rice and beans (red) which was great.

Meat pie was exactly what I wanted, with a little kick.  I am looking forward to going back and trying the whole menu.  A local/regular recommended the curried goat next!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Good prices.  Had the Jerk Pork and Chicken and they both were flavorful and delicious.  The Plantains were perfect!"}
