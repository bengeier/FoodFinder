{"text":"We love this restaurant.  I don't get to this one as often as I do the Wesley Chapel location but it definitely has it's advantages.  This one is far less noisy, comfortable and far less busy.  As far as the staff, they are young, polite and full of energy.  The food is great and consistent.  Their wings are tangy and spicy but are drier and not as hot as the Wesley Chapel location.  The pizza is good and consistent, never burned or raw.  We HATE inconsistency!  We always know what to expect here.  It's great.  Parking is ample, seating is private and adequate and the price is fair."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:30. No one in the restaurant. Ordered a sub and was told over a 30 minute wait. 6 people standing around at registers. Kitchen too busy making pick up orders. 
No way to treat a walk in customer. Will not be going back here. Too many other pizza and sub shops in town."}
{"text":"Go across the street to Villa Mia!!! Brooklyn Pizza is so so...way over priced and VERY greasy. Garlic knots were burnt.  I ordered their Pizza, Ziti, garlic knot special. I was quoted the special price over the phone. I gave my husband the coupon and he went to pick it up. He didn't know the quoted price. It is our fault he forgot to present coupon. However, they should have asked for it knowing that I ordered \"the special.\" He came home and mentioned how expensive it was. I called after for the significant difference to be refunded, if I brought the coupon back in. They refused, giving no options. Therefore, I will refuse them my business. Especially when there is an even better pizza place, Villa Mia (in Harris Teeter lot), across the street."}
{"text":"the place is really awkard when you first come in so i go in order and the cashier is rude, i order drink they didnt give them to me yet, anther person jus slams forks on the table leaves. then finally i ask about the drinks and she says they are at the end of the counter. how am i suppsed to know? the pizza is was not good! i just did not like my whole experience there."}
{"text":"It was great that it was a cash only cheese pie night. When I got my pizza home, I grabbed a slice and all the toppings fell off. I had to cook the pizza in my own oven for longer. It's a great place for the over privileged kids of the area to work. That's about it though. There are many more 'New York' pizza places in the area that are better. For a first timer, this place disgusted me."}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday in February for lunch. Dead bugs on floor near windows next to booths. Changed to a table. They need to do a better job cleaning the place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff whether dine in or take out. They have excellent pizza, try meatballs as a topping, outstanding. Dinners are great, as are their subs but the portions are getting smaller and smaller and can be inconsistent. Chicken part a favorite in our house. The only thing I would stay away from is the pre-made case ( chicken rolls, calzones, pinwheels etc...) they do not reheat well and wind up dry. Also get them to make it fresh."}
{"text":"Had to work late at the store and my wife went with kids to have Pizza at Brooklyn Pizza and brought me the Ravioli with vodka sauce ... It was the BEST vodka sauce I've had. I asked her to bring me two orders next time! I've been to the place a few times and its very warm and inviting and the service is great. I just wish there was one closer."}
{"text":"This place used to be much better than it is now.  The pizza is mediocre compared to other NY style pizza in the area. That could explain why this place is empty when other pizza places are full.  They also nickel and dime you too and blame it on the ownership. Want some extra croutons on your salad after spending $30 on a meal.  Well, that will be more $$."}
{"text":"Cheese rice ball was really good, a little on the salty side but nice & big! The plain Sicilian pizza was a little cold but tasty. The staff is very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"I don't live far from this restaurant so I really wanted to like it.
I ordered a Sicilian pie and I have to say that it was - no doubt - the worst Sicilian pie I've ever ordered. The crust was awful and tasted like cardboard. The toppings, including the sauce were very skimpy and tasteless. If you are looking for a Sicilian pie by all means avoid this place! 
I'm going back to Fontanella's in Matthews even though it is a drive for me."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Brooklyn.  Please keep up the wonderful work.  We love everything here and it remains our #1 spot for great pizza, great subs, and excellent apps and pastas.

Great white pizza, fantastic penne alla vodka, and the soups, when they have it during soup season, are fantastic according to wife and father.  Try the sausage, peppers, and onions appetizer...dee-lish!

Consistently makes us happy.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"What the hell happened to Brooklyn Pizza!?! It just goes out of business out of nowhere? What did they find a meth lab in the back?

Anybody know why they closed?"}
{"text":"We come almost every week for lunch.  Great deal, meal for 2 with drinks for about 12 bucks.  Pizza slices are large and fresh"}
{"text":"I want to love this place because it's close by. However, the staff is horrible and the food is very inconsistent. The staff could care less about customer service. The best example of this is probably when I ordered a ham and cheese calzone for take out. They basically took a cheese calzone that was obviously made quite some time ago, sliced it open and shoved some sliced deli ham in and then closed it like a sandwich. Definitely something you would never see in NY and they do claim to be authentic. I called to speak with the manager and she argued with me about it. Really? The owners need to take a good look at who is working for them and how things are being done. Such a shame really..."}
{"text":"We have been regular patrons for at least ten years now, but after tonight's negative experience we will NOT return. We ordered our food at approximately 8:30 pm, with the restaurant having a closing time of 9 pm. Sadly, the employees at Brooklyn pizza didn't care that we had spent $70 in their restaurant, all they cared about was escorting us out the door as soon as closing time hit. We were denied drink refills at nine and the servers were unwilling to allow us to finish eating. They began clearing our table as we were still eating, and not in a nice, polite way. They were clearly done having us in their restaurant, and we were not loitering, we were simply trying to finish the food we had ordered. 

This is a note for you to beware, if you happen to show up close to closing time expecting pleasant employees and a decent experience, you'll be disappointed. Customer service was severely lacking, and although the pizza wasn't bad, there are other establishments in Charlotte who most certainly will welcome our business, and I would expect, treat us with respect, unlike at Brooklyn Pizza. It just isn't good enough to be denied the courtesy of being allowed to finish eating the food that we paid for. Unbelievably RUDE employees and food that is just not worth the bad experience that came with it."}
{"text":"First time here and no complaints. We started with mozzarella sticks (nothing special just your typical frozen sticks) and garlic bread with cheese. We loved the garlic bread but the kids picked all the cheese off, next time we will order it without. Next we ordered Nonna's pizza, White pizza, plain cheese and a pepperoni. All were quite good. The white either does not come with garlic or did not have enough but a shaker of garlic powder on the table finished it off nicely. The slices are big and filling. The Nonna's pizza was delish. I was a little worried cause the bottom of the crust looked a little black and I thought it may be burnt. It had a nice crunch and no burnt taste to my surprise! Very yummy. Cheese and pepperoni were both good too. We will be back again and will continue to review different food items as we eat there :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a calzone and it tasted like it had been setting out all day.  It was burnt and hard as a rock.  We will not be back. We thought about giving it another try after a few years since our last bad visit: no more."}
{"text":"This is my first review I have ever written. Being in the same business I don't like to put others down, but the truth is the pizza wasn't good at all soggy, undercooked and the sauce was not good. They do have fresh ingredients and friendly staff. But that didn't make up for everything else that was wrong."}
{"text":"This is our quick go to.  I love the variety of single slice choices.  All of the food is always consistent and good.  I have had better Italian, however it's reasonably priced.  It is always busy and sometime hectic.  I would definitely recommend.  Much better than the other choices in the area."}
{"text":"Good knots, very good square pizza.  Get the Grandma slice.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Lemme just say that this pizza is more pricy than most, however when we got our hands on it, we couldn't help but notice its weight!! This thing was loaded with the toppings we ordered! Not to mention delicious! We're not super frequent here, but the few times we have ordered its been great."}
{"text":"So disappointing. We arrived at 8:30 on a Friday night and there were 3 customers at one table and about 5 staff out on the floor. They were cleaning the floors even though they are open until 10. I have a gluten allergy and I've had their gluten free pizza recently as take-out, and it was decent. I learned that they have gluten free penne, so I ordered the primavera with grilled chicken. It arrived on a big plate with a huge serving of pasta, lots of veggies, and 2 good size chicken breasts. Problem is, the pasta was undercooked and hard, the whole plate was swimming in a butter/water bath, and yet the chicken on top was dry. I tried mixing it together but the plate was so full, I couldn't. There was really no flavor to the chicken or the pasta and the vegetables were just awful, mushy and bland. My husband got the linguini alfredo which looked very unappealing. He ate a little and decided he would take it home and 'fix it' to make it taste better later. I honestly didn't even want mine; I tried. So, I went up and ordered myself a gluten free pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni, and extra cheese. I ate a dinner salad, which was a good mix of greens and shredded carrots, a little cucumber and tomato. The house dressing was good, but they give a small portion. My husband ordered a pinwheel (cheese and pepperoni wrapped in dough, which he liked a lot. My pizza was good, but I was tired by the time it arrived, so I had a piece and took the rest home. Overall, it was a pretty poor experience. I wouldn't bother dining in and I certainly won't try anything other than the pizza. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Authentic NYC?  Fuhgiddaboutit.  

I'm partial to the Chiacgo-style pies of my midwestern roots, but this is very solid NY-style pizza ... certainly not bad as far as South Charlotte goes.  

The Nonna's pie is great when you add a toppiing or two.  Excellent creativity on the menu (even if some of the combos don't come off all that well, they get serious points for sticking their necks out and trying).  

Great spot for young families.  If you're going on  Friday night you had better be there before 6pm -- the parking area can be cramped and this place can be really busy ... so plan ahead even if you are only doing carry-out.  

Best pizza for our money in South Charlotte since Mellow Mushroom left town.  And it is a bit more money -- these are not $5 Domino's pies ... but they do come up with some nice creations on their rotating menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get a slice with hot wings to go. My order is always fresh and ready in 10-15 mins. Everyone is really nice. This is a good place for good food."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Nonna pie. Feeds 3-4 people for 17$. Also recommend the garlic knots."}
{"text":"I normally don't post reviews, but this experience was so bad I had to share it.  Ordered 2 of the standard pizzas for carry out tonight.  They were fairly busy, but the front staff was friendly, and they had the pizzas to me in about a half hour.   When I brought it home and opened the boxes, the \"Brooklyn Bridge\" pizza had standing water in the whole back half of the box, and the entire crust (as well as the box) was soaked through.  

When we opened it, I called back immediately to let them know, and they offered to make me a new one, but it was going to take another 30 minutes to make.  My kids couldn't keep waiting that long, so I decided to just order another pizza from Papa's, who could get one to me in 10-15 minutes.  The girl up front was going to provide a credit, and then put Anthony (I assume the manager / owner) on the line to \"resolve\" the situation.  He proceeded to tell me that this particular pizza always put off some water, since there were vegetables on it.  I told him this was much more than just a little water, and he told me I \"shouldn't have ordered so many  mushrooms\". (note that this was a standard pizza off their menu!)  He told me that water couldn't have been spilled on it (that I was lying) and that he needed me to bring the pizza in to look at it.  The place is 15 minutes away one-way, and I wasn't about to drive back and forth again when I had another pizza on the way, so he hung up on me.  We'd been to the place several times in the past, and ordered that same pizza in the past, never with that kind of water soaked through.  Needless to say, tonight was my last trip to Brooklyn.   Great service, Anthony!!"}
{"text":"Best NY Pizza in Charlotte - garlic knots are delicious too. Service is always great and good value!!"}
{"text":"I always loved the food at Brooklyn Pizza by yesterday I decided to try something new. When I order a Calzone
with chicken unfortunately the chicken was not in it. After, talking to my server she explained that she did not know what happen but that she was sorry about it. Once i left the restaurant i call and spoke to Amanda who plainly told me that she was sorry as well. I do not know about everyone else but if i pay for something i expect to get it. Do not try the Calzone or try to add the extra items in it. You will be disappointed and the manager will not be bother with what you had to say."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pie of pepperoni pizza and it was really good. Also, everyone in the restaurant was really friendly, even though i accidentally came in right before the restaurant closed; which says a lot. 

I definitely recommend everyone checking this place out."}
{"text":"My family eats here often and we always enjoy the food and the service!! The pizza is delicious! Brooklyn Pizza is usually very busy, especially on Friday nights, and the staff does a great job of keeping cool and serving their customers as quickly as possible - especially Jill!! I moved here from NYC and this is the closet thing I have found to pizza that tastes like it is from home!"}
{"text":"There are two GREAT pizza places in South Charlotte, and this is one of them.  Do yourself a favor, and eat here!"}
{"text":"Update to my experience.  I reached out to the owner Anthony and he apologized for his manager and the experience of the meal.  Seems like an owner who really cares about his patrons.  I can't say enough good about his reaching out to me and the importance of knowing how much he cares for his business!  I also never had issues before this with staff or quality and frequent this place almost weekly for years.  I love eating local.

Ordered two pieces of cheese pizza slices and paid for four extra toppings each.  I just showed the picture to the manager who told me that even though only half the slice had extra cheese and toppings that what did I expect for 45 cents per topping?   Also that they have new people working there and that they are told to limit the amount of toppings and put them dead center.   The other piece had no meatballs even though we paid for them.  Long time customers totally disgusted with her response.  Not going back"}
{"text":"Just came from Brooklyn Pizza in Wesley Capel, this is the first review I have written but I think it's overdue.  We have gone to Brooklyn Pizza since it opened in Wesley Capel and before that the one on Rea Rd.  They start off great, as good as pizza can be  here in the Carolina's.  Then it begins, the short cuts start.  This time we noticed how chewy the crust has become.  Of course, they are pre-baking the crusts then covering them with whatever the customer orders.  I understand when it's bonkers crazy you have to find ways to get things done quickly but you had a good thing going and now we are out the door, looking for another \"NY\" style pizza place.  They seem to be opening one a week somewhere within driving distance.  Don't cut corners guys, don' t cheat the loyal faithful customers by counting the pieces of pepperoni slices like I heard one of the pizza maker guys say to a new guy one night.  Give us a good pie at a fair price and we will come back.  By the way your pizza is one of the most expensive around and just not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"This is as close to NY pizza as you can get in this area. This have some very tasty food and an excellent wait staff. The lines are always very efficient."}
{"text":"I come from NY and this was pretty damn close to being just like pizza from home!! Staff is friendly, prices are what I'm used to, but a little high for the area!! It makes me feel like home so I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"My kids and wife LOVE this place! My wife and Daughter have to order the Pinwheels every time we visit Brooklyn Pizza Parlor. My favorite is the White Pizza because i tend to get heartburn from tomato products and peppers. My sons love the wings, which is a big accomplishment by its self because we are wing experts - every where we go they want wings so we eat alot of wings and i am pretty picky about how dry or moist the wings are."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I'm from NY originally and the pizza is the best I've had since moving down to Charlotte.  There are a lot of tables in this place and it is a very open layout.  There are many types of pizzas to choose from - we went with the plain NY style pizza & Nonna's pie.  Both were amazing and we can't wait to go back and try more of their menu.  

The staff is all very friendly and helpful which is nice.  They have a pretty extensive beer/wine selection and offer specials on Thursdays, which are pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband is from NYC, so this spot hits home for him. I enjoyed the pizza as well. Big pies with a good taste. We have been back at least 3 times now. We would go more often but we stay outside of Charlotte so the drive is out of the way but the pizza is worth it."}
{"text":"We received a coupon for a free 16 inch pizza. Since moving from PA we weren't expecting much. We are always looking for a good pizza. I think we found it. We ate in and the pizza came out very hot and delicious!  I would go back. Not much to the inside with sports showing on the tv's. I will be returning."}
{"text":"This is now a weekly treat for pizza. This is authentic New York style pizza, indistinguishable from pie you'd get in NYC. Lots of places claim NYC style, this place actually comes through 100%. Nice staff, pleasant decor, an outside searing area, and by far the best pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of the few things I miss from my time living in the NYC metropolitan area is good pizza. So, imagine how excited we were to see \"Brooklyn\" pizza open. I was hopeful we were finally going to get some good pizza out here in union county. Not so much. This place is an overpriced, grease factory. We tried it on multiple occasions thinking the first time we just caught them on a bad night. Not so much. The one thing I will say is they are consistent, and that isn't a good thing. They get 2 stars cause their service is real good, 4 stars worth.  Pizza repeats on you all day, all night and it sits in you like a boulder. This place is nothing like New York pizza. If you go here, make sure you take some Tums or some other antacid."}
{"text":"So my mother is a bonafide New Yorker and from Brooklyn so she wanted to check this place out. We loved it! We've been twice and the food has been delicious. The pizza is the real deal!! Try the cheese garlic knots."}
{"text":"So we've gone to this restaurant for years.  The food is good and fairly consistent.  We'll keep going here, because Union County is so bereft of decent places to eat, but after looking at the receipt from our pizza order last night, I'm not sure how families can afford this place.  Over £33 for one pizza (nothing special, just a couple of toppings), one salad and 2 slices.  For a salad with lettuce, a couple of cucumber slices, 2 pepperoncini, and a bit of feta, why is this over £7??  For a night where we just wanted to bring in a pizza and watch a movie, this is just too expensive for a pizza place to charge.  We could have gone out to eat for a little more.  This is not what 'pizza night' should cost a family."}
{"text":"When they first opened, I loved their linguini with clam sauce.  However, through the years, it has become horrible.  It just isn't what they used to serve when they first opened, the clam sauce is just yucky now.  
Their pizza's still seem pretty good, and their Antipasto salad was, and possibly still is, wonderful - even though I haven't had it in a while.  Guess I'll go back to that salad, since my days of having their linguini and clam sauce are finished. I gave it numerous chances, but it just never measured up to what it had been when they opened their doors."}
{"text":"Food is good, but much too expensive. Lunch specials are a good deal. $16 for a large cheese pizza is gouging."}
{"text":"Eh. I am visiting my brother here in NC. We came to this place. It was super hectic and we had no idea how to start our order. We figured it out when we saw everyone standing in line and then rushing to claim a seats. We waited. Got our pizza. Lol this is a Brooklyn pizza?! Haha yeah right. This pizza was raw. The low quality sauce and cheese they use left the crust of the pizza oily and slimy. We asked the waitress to look at the pizza - she said that's how it comes out. Lol. Horrible. We asked for the pizza to be put back in the oven. Eh 5 mins later - same - now more burned pizza with a still raw crust came out. Instead of being a problem we ate this crappy \"Brooklyn\" pizza. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Wonderfull basic breakfasts at this restaurant known for its New York style pizza! My wife and I dropped by around 10 a.m on Sunday & ordered eggs, crisp bacon, sausage, toast, home fries, & coffee! Everything delivered was fresh, hot, & properly cooked & served. The meals for both of us cost about $17.50. We could not ask for a better breakfast.  Brooklyn Pizza is tops in my book for a really good meal !!"}
{"text":"This seems like the hot spot of the town ! I'm visiting my grandchildren they always love to go to Brooklyn pizza parlor. They meet all their neighbors there. Very friendly place ,the servers are friendly, the owner helps out serving the food also. They have the best garlic knots bread that I've ever had . We ordered the garlic knots we ordered a large cheese pizza and we had baked ziti. All the memorabilia is from Brooklyn so it really takes you back home. The only reason that I am giving it a four is because the food comes out little at a time they don't serve it all at one time."}
{"text":"This is the really deal, the pizza comes in huge slices with lots of toppings and tastes delicious.  It's a real taste of New York, and the service is fast and friendly.  I was kind of impresses with how personable they were.  They even have a nice selection of wine and beer to go along with the great food.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu yet, but they do have pasta dishes and subs for those who don't want pizza for some reason."}
{"text":"Yum!  This was my first visit to Brooklyn Pizza Parlor, and it won't be my last.  I was impressed at how BIG the restaurant is, how nicely decorated it is, and how it's not just your typical \"big room\" restaurant.  There are several types of tables, with divisions throughout (including a fireplace right in the middle of the room), so you can feel like you're getting some privacy no matter where you sit.  

You order at the counter and then they bring your food out to you when it's ready.  There are many menu choices besides pizza (although you can buy it by the slice or by the pie), including sandwiches, salads, and pasta.  This first time, we opted for the pizza.  We split a \"Meatza\" Pizza and a White Pizza, which are just what you'd expect by their names.  Both were delicious and came out fresh and hot.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  Even though we just ordered waters, many people stopped by at different times to see if we needed refills.  

Brooklyn Pizza Parlor is a casual dining restaurant, yet it feels nicer than a lot of casual dining restaurants.  Best of all, Santa Claus was in the next booth over with a pizza, so you know it has to be good!"}
{"text":"We ordered carry out on a Saturday night.  Nothing too crazy or complicated: one large cheese pizza and two gluten-free pizzas (cheese and pepperoni).  

The pizza was fresh and tasty, even after the drive back from the restaurant.  The gluten-free option is great for those people who have gluten allergies or are simply trying to cut gluten out of their diets.

I tried to take a picture, however before I could, the pizza was in my belly :)"}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years and have always been happy with the food. The last 2 times it has been sweltering hot. I asked both times if there was air at all. After a worker asked the owner she came back and said they couldn't do anything . It was the ovens opening and closing. We have eaten here for years during the summer and never had this problem. We stayed because I had starving kids. and ate but it was crazy! After 2 times with this we wont be back for a long while.  They need to fix the air conditioning . They have a very successful business but they have to take care of their customers. Air conditioning is not too much to ask"}
{"text":"Ordered ahead of time and the order was not ready. Waited a while and once the pizza finally came out, no apology was offered for the delay. 

As I waited I noticed the cashiers do not wear gloves and are handling food (big no no in the food industry). 

And now the important part: the food. The pizza was no better than grocery store quality and the salads were bland."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now. Both times the service Fast & friendly, the place was clean and good pizza is consistent so far. Fairly priced. Eat here."}
{"text":"When we rolled up to the place there was a pregnant worker outside smoking wearing her Brooklyn Pizza t-shirt. She looked as if she hadn't showered. The workers really seemed disinterested in being there. The place is kid-friendly and a great place to go when you're in workout clothes and haven't showered yourself. I got the Brooklyn cheesesteak and perhaps I just didn't have a strong order. I will try the pizza if we go back again."}
{"text":"The white pizza will honestly make you cry happy tears. Best pizza in CLT and I think most people agree."}
{"text":"Not very good..mediocre at best. I wish restaurants would focus more on quality...calzones are stale..Brooklyns pizza are stale and cold with mostly bread..its like a 16 dollar bread stick with a slice of cheese and a drop of pizza sauce..they must make a pretty good margin on that..lol. but hey it pays the rent"}
{"text":"Regular pizza was good. Gluten-free not so much. I appreciate the effort, but will get a dish next time. 
Also don't like the yoga pants on the girls."}
{"text":"I'm not a New Yorker, so cannot say if it's \"the real deal\", but I know I really love their New York style pizza.  Have only gone into NY style Pizza myself, but daughter really liked the ravioli, and their pannini sandwiches are huge.

Serving staff are friendly, and this is a great place to take the family.  Several TVs for watching sports too."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.  The atmosphere is awesome.  Unfortuately, the temperature during the heat of spring and summer is unbearable.  It is way too hot inside the restaurant to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"my family loves this place - consistently puts out a great pizza - good garlic knots and there wings are pretty good also."}
{"text":"After more than five years since my last visit, I decided to make a special run to Brooklyn Pizza Parlor.  The pizza was good, but not extraordinary.  I ordered one \"meatza\" pizza and a cheese pizza.  The sauce was mildly sweet and the crust was chewy, slightly thicker than my preference.  The cheese had good flavors while the meats were generally less flavorful than the best in the area.  If Domino's is a \"C\" pizza, then Brooklyn is a \"B+\".  Much better than average, but not quite in the league with the best in these parts.  At the price, I'll look elsewhere for my next pizza fix, while not regretting my long deferred choice."}
{"text":"I am from the north east.  This pizza is the best traditional pizza pie in Charlotte.  You get excellent value here.  No comparison to other restaurants in town claiming to be legit NY style pizza."}
{"text":"the pizza is delicious... greasy but delicious.. the only bad thing is they do not deliver. . their salads and sandwiches are great too. of course they have a kids menu and they are willing to work with you if you want to bring in a big group. great place to go and sit outside with a group of friends"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and hate the lighting.   Please get bulbs that have have a bottom filter as the lights are so glaring.  Very cozy place yet feels like I'm under a spot light."}
{"text":"We decided to order a pizza for take out this weekend while we were out running errands.  We just went basic with a plain cheese. The pizza was ready to go pretty quickly. 

For me the pizza is a-ok... but not great. The crust is not the best and it was a bit too greasy for me. 

This place is preferred over \"fast food pizza\" like Farley's...but definitely not my favorite pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza at Brooklyn is outstanding. 5 stars.

Unfortunately, this review is NOT about the food. I called in an order for a pizza on a Friday night at around 6:15pm. Understandably, they were very busy. I expected this before ordering, which is why my first question when I called was \"How long would a take-out pizza take at this time?\" The woman answered with \"about 30 minutes\". Cool, I thought, because I live in Fort Mill and I figured it would take me about 20-25 minutes to get there. I placed my order and jumped in the car to go get it.

If you've never been to Brooklyn Pizza, when you walk in there's a place to order food to eat there and a separate counter to pick up 'to go' orders. When I arrived, there wasn't a single person in line to order 'eat-in' food and there was 13 people in the the 'to go' line. I actually had to ask the people ahead of me \"did you all order to go?\", because I thought some of them might have been confused as to how the lines worked. Nope, they knew.  Each person ahead of me stepped up to the counter one at a time, told the person their name, paid for their food and either got it or waited. Now, here's my problem with that. When I arrived, it was almost exactly 30 minutes from when I ordered. It took me almost 15 minutes to get to the front of the line. At least 4 people ahead of me paid for their food and it wasn't even ready for them yet, which tells me that they ordered AFTER I did. And the people that did get their food as soon as they paid had to wait about a minute each for the ONE person working the counter to run their credit card and then walk all the way back to get their food.

Here's where they're failing, in my opinion. 1) When there is no one in line to order food to eat in the restaurant, the other 'cashiers' should invite people from the 'to go' line over to their registers to help move the line faster. Or 2) Someone should be walking the 'to go' line and asking the people that are 3 or 4 deep for their names so that they can go back into the kitchen to check on the status of their orders, that way, when they make it to the front of the line, their food is ready to be carried out so that the 'to go' cashier doesn't have to hold up the line because they're spending time in the kitchen. Or 3) When to go orders are ready, they should call out the name on that order and let that person come to the front of the line to pay and go. No one should have to wait for people that ordered after them to pay and then wait for their food. Paying first shouldn't be the priority, ordering first should. Or 4) They need to get a food warmer that sits in their 'to go' area so that when you pay for your food it is right there ready to go and you don't have to wait, like I did, for about a full minute for the woman to go get my pizza. I understand it sounds like nit-picking when we're talking about a minute or less, but when you add that up over 15-20 customers, that's a long time.

So, in summary, here's the deal. I absolutely love the pizza from Brooklyn and I wish there was another location closer to where I live. I think they'd do exceptionally well with a third location in the the Fort Mill/Rock Hill area, because the pizza around here is not all that great. However, their 'to go' system is flawed, at least at the Colony Rd. location. Perhaps, I caught them on a bad night. But, when I overheard the two women ahead of me in line discussing how they always have to wait to get 'to go' orders, with the one even suggesting that the other pre-heat her oven at home before she leaves to get her pizza, I have to believe this is a regular thing. When I finally got my pizza and was leaving, I took a pic of all the people in the 'to go' line and I felt sorry for them. There was at least 10 people that probably had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get their order. Had I known how their current system works, I would have ordered while sitting in my car in the parking lot and then walked in to stand in line for 15 minutes, paid for my food, and then waited a little longer for my order. If that's what they expect customers to do, then I imagine a lot of business is turned away because of it. I truly hope they can figure out a way to make this system better, because their product is great. I want them to succeed. Good luck Brooklyn Pizza."}
{"text":"Tried Brooklyn pizza parlor for the first time and the Nona pie was one of the best pies I've had, ever. But... there is more to the story. I went back a few days later and got another Nona only to be seriously disappointed. The pie was so tough we could hardly eat it. So far I'm on the fence about this place because of the consistency."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Brooklyn Pizza a couple of times, I've been when it was delicious and I have been when it was not.  Once we ordered stromboli and it was raw in the middle, so I had to finish it off in my oven at home. That is strange for a pizza place not to have that down to a science.

Tonight we went in and I knew it was going to be family central.  People, if you have kids it is a great place to have dinner.  Families are loaded in there and it is loud.  If you do not like kids, this is one mouse away from being Chuck E Cheese.  We had a couple of beers, salad, garlic knots and two slices, $16.  My slice was not hot, it was like they just handed it to me from sitting in the window.  I would go back if someone invited me, but I would never suggest it."}
{"text":"Greasy pizza. But if you love that NYC pizza then go for it. I think it is a bit expensive for what it is but the alternative is Dominoes- so you will probably go ahead and pay the money for this stuff. Wish it was better."}
{"text":"Long ago, when I first moved to the QC, I worked in this area and used to frequent this place with friends or for lunch. It's nothing special, but rather just your run-of-the-mill neighborhood/family pizza place. 

I've been here a few times since and have been pleased each time. Namely, the Hawaiian Luau Pizza is a favorite. The sauteed onions are a wonderful touch and, surprisingly, fantastic when eaten cold. I'd get this every time. 

The interior is as expected. Booths, tables, kitschy decor, and tons of appeal for little league baseball teams/NY enthusiasts alike. 

A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"Good authentic NY pizza, taste just like the pizza from B'klyn. When you order they give you a street sign to identify you and your order; all the street signs I saw are authentic. I am a native of B'klyn."}
{"text":"Great food. Good value. A pizza will fill you up! I can't say anything about eating in the restaurant but I pick up a pizza frequently and my pizza is done when they say it will be done and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Havent gotten pizza here in a few years.  Last night was a reminder of why.  
The NY style crust was the problem.  It was so \"rubbery\" I could hardly chew it.  
We also got a Sicilian that I would try.  Crust was much better but the  pizza was flavorless. 
The search continues for \"THE\" best pizza in Union County,NC.  This is definitely not it.  Sorry Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Wow!  How can I explain how bad the food was??  Bought 2 calzones and some pasta for take out.  Calzone #1 was a pepperoni and ham. #2 was a mushroom garlic & bacon.  Besides being cold, the calzone breading was hard as possible.  The only soft spot was the golf ball sized center.  This small spot also happened to be the only part of the thing that had filling, which was a 1 inch stack of super salty pepperoni surrounded by some ham shreds. This was then surrounded by a small pasting of ricotta.  The pasta was supposed to be garlic and oil covered but it was devoid of garlic & very bland.  I've been to Brooklyn and I've had pizza there.  This place is not worthy of the name."}
{"text":"Brooklyn Pizza combines good pizza by the slice with good prices in a convenient location.

I stick with pizza by the slice.  Be sure to check out the glass case to see what's available before you order.  I love the \"foldable\" crust and like the flavor of the pizza sauce.  The white pizza is a great balance of cheese with garlic.

I love the NY subway map on the floor.  I think it's a fun touch and gives a good nod to the NY style menu.

The staff are friendly and welcoming and they do a good job of keeping your drinks full.

It's a family favorite and perfect for a quick inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"The quality of the pizza depends on when the pizza was made. Often it has been sitting in the open shelf drying out waiting to be reheated, if you order by the slice. But, the quality is OK. There are better pizza options in the local area."}
{"text":"I come to Brooklyn Pizza once or twice a month and my usual order is two slices of pizza with mushrooms.  The pizza is pretty good and very reasonable in price.  The service is always great.  I decided to try something different yesterday and went with angel hair and meatballs.  When I placed the order, I told them to go light on the sauce.

A few minutes later, my order came.  I saw a fairly large plate of pasta with two decently sized meatballs.  A good amount of steam was coming off of the pasta.  So far, so good.  When I looked closer, I saw that there was a ton of sauce on the pasta....not what I wanted.  The meatballs looked a bit strange.  I may be wrong, but they did not look homemade (they were near perfect replicas of each other on the outside), and the inside of them looked very processed-looking.  Neither the sauce (which was a-plenty) nor the meatballs had much taste to them and I poured on a ton of grated cheese and crushed pepper to doctor the dish up a bit.  Moreover, the meatballs were both cold.  I told the server and she brought me over another meatball.  You guessed it- it was a clone of the other two and it also was cold.

Next time I go, I will stick with the pizza and avoid the pasta."}
{"text":"Can not say how much I love this place. These guys are from NY and make real NY pizza. I cant find another place like this in Charlotte. If you do let me know I will try it. This is the only place I go for pizza and its 30 mins away from where I live. MUST TRY..."}
{"text":"Our family really likes Brooklyn.  The NY pizza is good as are the garlic knots.  The girls that come around are pretty good with refills.  The atmosphere is casual and great for families.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is that sometimes I have heard employees (not the young girls just to be clear) complaining about customers which is kind of awkward."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat in Indian Trail, and I try to eat here at least once a week.  The buffalo wing pizza and baked ziti are amazing, but I can't attest to anything else since I get the same thing every time. The only thing better than the food is the amazing service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Good crust and looks legit but a little bland (think it was just an off night).  The chicken cutlet sandwich was good."}
{"text":"Update:
I thought I'd give this place a second chance and ordered take-out again. I think this place saves their mess-ups for take-out customers, because once again, I got a JUNK meal. My Brooklyn Famous Stromboli was not nice and tan as in the picture, but rather, was more chocolate colored. I have no idea why this place is so busy. Apparently, the people eating here have never had good Italian pies and other dinner pastries. Brooklyn should sue this place for ruining their good name. AWFUL!!!

I ordered a calzone but I am not crazy about ricotta cheese. My wife doesn't like it at all so I got one and she didn't. The calzone can be made with any toppings so why can we not keep the calzone until said time. Then, when I got my calzone it wasn't even closed all the way. It was just kinda flopped over like an omelette. If it's going to look this bad, then why is it so hard to remove ricotta. I think there's probably a better place elsewhere."}
{"text":"So lucky that I get to call this my favorite pizza place in South Charlotte. I usually order the Sicilian by the slice here, and it tastes great every time.  Two Sicilian slices usually come out to under $6...which is a steal as far as local pizza goes.  There are waits for take-out ordering at times, but in the end it is worth it.  The owner frequently checks on customers to see how they're enjoying their food, which is always plus. If i tried more than the Sicilian & Margherita pizzas on the menu - and if they renovated their seating areas and decor - then I would feel more compelled to give 5 stars.  Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"So I've noticed quite a few excellent reviews on this place, however I'm probably not going to make the authors very happy!! In all honesty I'd rate this place 2.5. I should rate them a 1 considering my friend ended up with food poisoning however I did not so 2.5 it is!! 

I ordered a slice of pepperoni/mushroom pizza and the zucchini sticks. The pizza was alright, not great. It wasn't really hot and I could tell all they did was take a slice of pepperoni and throw some mushrooms on it before halfway heating it up. They pretty much all fell off as the cheese wasn't even melted enough to make them stick. The taste would have been there had it been a fresh pizza made to order I think. My crust was hard as a rock due to sitting for so long and the halfway reheat.  I will say however the zucchini sticks were awesome, absolutely loved those but zucchini is my favorite vegetable!! The Marinara dipping sauce for them was watery, cold, and lacking in spice/flavor.  Maybe we went at a bad time, or maybe the trick is to order an entire pizza (that isn't pre-made).  I really want to believe that I hit this place on a bad afternoon so I will be back to try them again (if only to get the zucchini sticks... did I mention they were good!!)  I'll review again at that time and hope I don't end up with the same fate my friend did!!"}
{"text":"Arriving just before 2 pm on a Friday, there was hardly anyone there and the staff was making pizzas boxes for what I imagine is a busy night of takeout.  Staff was friendly, food arrived quickly.

Philly Cheesesteak:  The bread was nice and soft, meat was tender though not a lot of it, onions and peppers were cooked well, cheese was plentiful.
Side of fries:  Standard frozen shoe string fries.  Cooked and seasoned well, served with packets of ketchup, large order for $1 add-on price to the sandwich.
Fountain drink of root beer was refilled once.

The sandwich was A-OK and I would return again to try out their pizza which seems to be rated quite well."}
{"text":"Not sure what kind of \"New York Pizzeria\" serves calzones without any cheese other than a small spoonful of ricotta, but we found one. Additionally, overcooked and I literally cut my gums repetitively on the crust. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Pizza is OK but the rings are good. When we first moved In the area, we would eat here a lot. Overall staff is cool."}
{"text":"Surprised I have not rated this excellent pizza place as we have been regulars for years.  Funny how that happens.

They really have great pies.  Yeasty dough, not thick and not cracker thin, but just right.  Tomato sauce with flavor and even a cheese pizza is special.  Have yet to get out of our rut to try Stromboli and other such items, but did \"get out there\" to do their penne vodka and it was GREAT!  

Oh Lord...does this mean that I will be in a decision loop trying to decide on which one each time?  Or will I just get both and split them with wife?

Full bar, lots of room and you regularly see kid athletic teams having their parties there.  Fits right in without a problem.  

Take-out is normal and those pies stay hot for quite some time.  And pizza is great for breakfast with just a microwave heat-up.

New Yorkers will poo-poo anything, regardless of flavor and quality unless it is made in \"The City\" so ignore them and enjoy Brooklyn Pizza as it is REALLY good."}
{"text":"Good pie and pasta at a reasonable price. Thin crust NY style is foldable yet still has just a bit of crispy oven crunch."}
{"text":"Great plain cheese pizza! Came out fresh out of the oven. The pizza was not over sauced -- just the way I like it.  The crust was crispy at the edges and thin. It was a bit warm in the place, but the lady working kept us topped off on iced tea. Would come back here and would like to try some of their specialty pizzas . You can also order buy the slice from some of the pre-made pizzas as well."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff.  Got canzone to go.  One cheese and spinach and one with peperoni and mushrooms. There was so little cheese on it I had a hard time finding it.  Bread is good but that's about all we got.  Would have sent it back if we were eating in."}
{"text":"Delicious Stromboli and the pin wheels are yummy. Price is on the mid to high end but it's worth it. Good atmosphere"}
{"text":"We have avoided this place based on the reviews. We happened to be shopping at the Target so we decided to stop in. So glad we did! We got here about 11 AM and all of their pizzas by the slice were freshly made. We tried the Brooklyn Bridge, the Hawaiian, the Meatza and the Sicilian. The pizza came out hot and fresh. The crust was crunchy and delicious. All of the toppings were fresh. This is Sicilian was light and crispy. The best pizza we have had in the area. I cannot explain the other reviewers' comments except to say maybe the pizza differs in quality during different times of the day. But we had an excellent experience and we are going to come back for sure."}
{"text":"OK update again.  3/5/17.  Got the Nonna's pizza and it was really good.  Nice crispy thin crust."}
{"text":"First, I believe in Chicago pizza. 

This pizza though, I liked it. I thought I wasn't going to, being a Chicago girl & all, but it surprised me. We tried the nonna pizza & it was a good choice for us. Simple but tasty. We also tried their zucchini sticks which were very yummy! I love that they were more tempura battered. So good! I look forward to our return."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza. It's the first pizza I've had since being in North Carolina. I thought their nonna was going to be like grandma pie in NJ. Not really. Their regular cheese isn't bad thou."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Good size portions and a fine menu consisting of pizza and Italian classics. Our server Mathew gave us outstanding service."}
{"text":"I have been craving eggplant parm lately so when we said we were going to a NY style pizza place I figured score...uh not so fast.  While it was indeed eggplant it was served so oddly, 3 flat, round frozen pieces of eggplant spread out over ziti, instead of stacked in layers.  I have a cold so I was told it wasn't that bad, but all I know is the cheese shouldn't make up for the lack of yummy eggplant flavor.  The sauce I knew was gonna be bad as soon as they set my plate down, it was that bright red sauce that doesn't look authentic and is overly sweet and needs to be seasoned like crazy.  It was also served with a piece of blah, cold bread.

The rest of the fam got an antipasto salad and pizza, so I pushed my plate aside and ate the pizza.  It was good, not great, have had much better in Charlotte.  It was served straight from the oven and so the cheese slid right off theslice when you picked it up because it was piping hot.

Overall it was fine, you order at the counter and they deliver to your table.  Refills were offered, plates were cleared at a decent pace.  Its not my new fave but I'd go again and skip the eggplant and stick to pizza."}
{"text":"The service here is very good. The pasta is sub par and the pizza taste like cardboard. I had higher expectations based on reviews, but walked out disappointed."}
{"text":"We love Brooklyn Pizza. It is our usual Friday night family dinner favorite. It is casual, great for that Friday night get together for pizza. The food is consistently good and they are Steelers fans, so that makes it so much better. I will say, some nights it is tough to find a seat. The families come off the soccer and baseball fields and head to Brooklyn and don't follow the rules of ordering 1st before sitting. The kids save tables while the parents stand in line for 10 minutes. It is a bit frustrating sometimes. Overall, it is a great quick pizza night atmosphere. The food is good, the service is good and it is very casual. We hit it at least 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"Outstanding and authentic NY style pizzas. Try the Nona's Pizza. It's probably the best Sicilian style pizza I've ever eaten. The wings are good! As a Buffalo, NY area native, I can say that their chicken wings do not disappoint! Just make sure to order them \"crispy!\""}
{"text":"I just ate there today for my moms birthday . We where very disappointed . The pizza was a special pizza it was horrible . It had a lack of sauce and peppers , the onions, crust where not cooked enough . Also it was cold. Who made the pizza , do they have new cooks ? We eat there all the time ."}
{"text":"The place looks cool inside but I was not impressed with the food at all. I understand making cheese pies beforehand but every piece of dough I had was stale tasting; including the garlic knots.

I'll come back one more time to try their pastas but I can get a better pie from a smaller place near home."}
{"text":"So, first time here and probably last. I don't mind having to go to the counter to order my food,  although I find it an inconvenience.... especially when they have a large menu that includes dinner entrees. Ordered...tea, soda, sausage Stromboli, fries and baked ziti with eggplant. My main issue is items are made in two different parts of the kitchen and they can't seem to coordinate with each other. First out, Stromboli... probably pre-made so it heats in the pizza oven in a matter of minutes. Ten minutes later, you guessed it, out comes fries and Baked Ziti. We complained to the food runners...DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS!! Manager came over and asked how things were, she was told we were upset. I explained about the timing and she explained the two kitchen system. I said it would make sense to cook the ziti and fries and when they were almost ready, fire the Stromboli. She told me the cashiers were supposed to ask if the food should come out together. I explained that I ordered two drinks and two different dinners so it would make sense that I wanted everything to come out together. She did the right thing by apologizing and asked if she could do anything for us. I said no as I didn't want anything for free. I ordered my wife's dinner to go and handed the girl my CC, she handed it back and said I was on the house, no charge. I told her thank you and I didn't come in for free food. She  understood and apologized for the mix up. I guess we will be back....next time pizza."}
{"text":"Nice place, lousy pizza.

Stopped there for lunch, the special was \"two slices of specialty pizza\" Ok I ordered one meat and one vegetarian. I take a glimpse at the pizzas and see they're only half baked, kind of makes sense when you have little traffic and the stuff may sit around for hours. The downside is that they take longer to heat up but that didn't bother me.

What bothered me is that when the pizza slices arrived the crust was tasted and felt like cardboard, there weren't anywhere cheesy enough, and I didn't like the toppings one bit. The sausage and ham were sliced and chopped to the size of confetti, the vegetarian slice was overwhelmed by a load of under-cooked peppers  

NY pizza, this? I've had better pizza at the food court of shopping malls. Since pies are baked to order , very possibly they're not that bad but as far as slices go , meh I've had a LOT better."}
{"text":"Probably the most mediocre Italian restaurant I've eaten at. Can't speak for the pizza but the calzones come with almost no cheese. The calzones also pop open on their own because the bread is so stiff. Cheese tortellini Alfredo is just noodles and plain white sauce - no added cheese & very bland. Sauce tasted like it was out of a can. We were all really excited about eating here as we'd heard good things but were unanimously disappointed. Would only eat here as a last resort."}
{"text":"We had the Nonna's and it was great!  Be prepared for tons of tomatoes. The crust is perfect!! Crispy crunchy and could hold the weight of the toppings. This is one of the best pizzas I've had in Charlotte. Worth the drive if it's not in your neighborhood. We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few weeks ago trying to find a place to watch a NY Jets game since about every bar in the area was packed. Stumbled upon this place to get pizza, and figured they would have the game on since they claim to be very New York with their name and decor.  No NY games showing.  What came out of this was having THE BEST pizza ever at Brooklyn Pizza.  I'm a native New Yorker and 90% of the places in NY don't even compare to the great taste and flavor as this.  The pie also came out super hot, which burns the roof of your mouth.  

Later in the week, we got pizza and wings to go.  The quality suffers from eating the pizza at home.  Plain wings were over fried and seemed day-old. Sauced up wings were \"eh\".  Stay in at Brooklyn Pizza and eat here instead.  Saves the clean up!"}
{"text":"Good for an almost quick lunch. You order at counter and then your order is delivered. Pizza is good, thin crusted and not oily. Just don't understand how long it takes to heat 4 slices of pizza. It was Sunday afternoon and not very crowded. Service people are friendly and are ready to please."}
{"text":"Ordered the pasta primavera and I was not impressed at all. For 11$ I expected better. It was pretty much pasta and vegetables with no flavor or seasoning. There was no sauce except for a lot of water at the bottom of the plate. Pizza is ok but not great. No better than Pizza Hut or papa johns in my opinion."}
{"text":"This pizza place is the closest thing to NY.  Don't get me wrong, the feel of the place does not make you forget that you are in Charlotte and are eating at some local pizza joint in Queens or Brooklyn.  But if you close your eyes and use a bit of imagination, you might think you are! Yes, the pizza is that good.  Being a home-grown NY guy,  I can say that I'm lucky to have had the best pizza in the country whenever I wanted.  Now that I'm in Charlotte (and anywhere else for that matter), good pizza is hard to come by.  Besides your run-of-the-mill Pizza chains like Pizza Hut and Dominoes (all of which I am not a fan of), I think the best pizza places are those which you can grab a quick bite to eat.  In NY, we refer to these joints as \"street corner\" pizza places.  BK Pizza Parlor is that type of place - but also has the feel of a restaurant.  

I had the regular cheese pizza - no need to get all fancy.  The crispy crust, tasty sauce, and whopping amounts of gooey cheese made this place the best pizza place i have had in Charlotte.  I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Always get good pizza at Brooklyn. Crisp and hot. Fast and friendly. One of the better pizza spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Brooklyn and it's two cousins take #2 for best pizza in Charlotte behind Due Amici in the University Area. Brooklyn South is in Wesley Chapel in a bustling shopping center with CFA, Target, and some various other stores. When you enter, you walk to the counter and place your oder. They have a huge subway map on the floor which is super cool. Last time I was there, I got 2 slices of cheese and a water. They give you your drink right at the counter and you take a street sign back to your table so they know where to bring your food.

I sat down at a booth, but the booth itself still had pizza crumbs on it. Ew. The table was clean but I guess they just missed the booth. The food came out fairly quickly and it was HOT. Unbelievably hot but also so delicious. Crispy crust that could be folded, a nice amount of cheese--not too much--and great tomato sauce. It's really very good pizza.

Service is friendly and efficient--no complaints here. Brooklyn South could just be the best pizza in south Charlotte!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went in for lunch today. It was not crowded, as we were there before noon. The lady who was working the counter was very nice and helpful. My pizza was really tasty, the salad was meh, (the Ranch was Ken's pre packaged dressing, and I just don't like pre packaged dressing) and my friend's cheese steak was dripping greasy, watery stuff all over her and the plate. In several different places around the restaurant there were signs advertising Rice Balls, and we were curious what they were so we asked the guy who brought our drinks what they were, but he didn't know and never came back to tell us. We were going to ask the lady behind the counter what they were, but when we were finishing up our meal the next customers after us came into the restaurant, forming a line at the counter, so my friend goes over to ask the guy working in the kitchen, what exactly are rice balls? He turns to her and just stares for about 5 seconds before saying, \"I'm sorry, I am kind of busy right now.\" He was chopping peppers. I found that completely rude and we won't be going back there for lunch any time soon."}
{"text":"Go to staple for the fam. Great pizza. Feedback if they see this,  needing some customer experience updates. Needs some more neighborhood specials and dining room updates with tv's...glad to have them around. Will always go."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Our waitress rolled her eyes when my son asked for a refill of his sweet tea. This is not the first time an employee has treated us poorly here."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of times, both of which were good.  Their house salad is a traditional American style salad --very basic (lettuce, tomatoes, etc), and their pizza is traditional New York style --hence the name.  Their pepperoni pizza is extremely greasy which is good if you enjoy that kind of pizza.

The restaurant is cafe style with a great layout.  Has plenty of flat-screen TV's and is very clean and tidy.

I'd certainly eat here again though probably wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Best hawaiian pizza I've even had! Bacon, pineapple, caramelized onions... why can't all pizza restaurants make it this good?
It's a great price, and it's my favorite kind of crust. Thin, but not too thin, and crispy enough to hold up to the toppings. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place, and sometimes I do. Other times not so much.

I have come here and left feeling like I have found the mecca of NY style pizza, so good it reminded me of home, and other times I have left regretting even ordering anything.  

The service is always good, let me start with the positive. The girls that work there always have a smile on their face and are very helpful with any requests. 

The food on the other hand is so hit or miss, it totally depends on the day as to whether you are going to enjoy your food or not, and I am talking about when you order the same exact thing on different days.  There have been times when the pizza was cooked to perfection, with a nice char on the crust, and perfect toppings, and there have been times where the pizza looked like it was just passed through the oven, with a barely edible crust that is pretty much raw.

Unfortunately I like consistency with my food, and I'm not willing to spend my hard earned money, knowing I could get home with my pizza and feel like I could have gotten a better one from the frozen food section of the grocery store."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here.  Prompt service in a relaxing atmosphere.  Can U guys offer Wi-fi?"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here the cash register people are always in an upset mode. I say thank you and polite but I just get a stared and no smile at all.  I feel like because I am Chinese and that's the type of treatment I get."}
{"text":"After seeing a photo of their NY Style Pizza on Yelp, my husband & I decided to try Brooklyn Pizza.  The concept was a little different from other pizza places we've been to - you order at the front counter and find a table and they bring your order to you.  They do come around and help with refills, etc.  

The pizza was very good!  Definitely on-point NY Style pizza.  We ordered a pepperoni pie and it was excellent.  Very greasy, but I'm one of those people who like it that way.  We also ordered garlic knots and they were delicious as well.  

I'm giving them 4 stars instead of five because when we came in, it took a few minutes for the guy behind the counter to acknowledge us.  We asked one of the girls who was walking around if she could help take our order and she couldn't.  It wasn't the best welcome, but as they say patience is a virtue and our patience paid off with a yummy dinner.  The leftover pizza was just as good!  This place is definitely worth a try and we will be back when we are craving pizza!"}
{"text":"Yo! This place is like a slice of New Yawk in South Charlotte. Great pizza, Strombolis, da works. My accent starts coming back the minute I walk through the door. Do ya self a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered a New York pepperoni and sausage,  pretty good and also had garlic Knotts,  was fresh and hot .. also got a chocolate chunk cookie . Looks way better than it tastes. ."}
{"text":"Coming from NJ and having eaten pizza in all 5 boroughs, especially Brooklyn- this is damn good for this area! Pizza is as close to NY/NJ style as it comes down here and we won't be going elsewhere for a while. We haven't tried anything but the pizza to be fair but entrees seemed to be moderately priced and looked piping hot when served."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious. It's not dry yet it has the crunch. Perfect cheese/sauce ratio. Best pizza in town"}
{"text":"For Charlotte this is as good as it gets.  Everything on the menu is good.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun.   Try it, you'll like."}
{"text":"This place brings NYC to Charlotte. They even have slices available. I'm only giving them 4 stars because there is a lack in consistency of their food. Most of the time it's really good, but there have been a few times that they really dropped the ball. There is a lot of seating and it's very clean."}
{"text":"This is a nice little popular pizza parlor in town everyone is friendly and its a very busy family restaurant. We tried their special ,large pizza, baked ziti and garlic knots all very good,NY Style. Everything is homemade and handmade pizzas.You order at the counter and they deliver it to your table.They also have beer and wine available."}
{"text":"Very overrated and overpriced. Crust taste like it came from a can, vegetables taste stale and old, and meats have no flavor. Ordered a bbq chicken and the bbq sauce tasted like it came from a generic jar.  Onions were not warm so I have to assume the cooks forgot before making the pizza and threw them on top afterwards.  Chicken had no seasoning and flavor. Obviously not a true bbq chicken because it looked like the cooks cut up some Chicken and threw it on as an after thought.  Wasted $18. Little Caesars is better. 

Oh and don't expect your food in a timely fashion. Even on a slow night it will take the kitchen 30 mins"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed on my last visit.  The young girl who took our order made a mistake keying in our order.  No problem, not a big deal.  When we sat down my wife asked about the total we were charged and it seemed high.  We totaled it up in our heads and it seemed like we had been overcharged.  I asked a waitress to ask a manager to come to the table.  The manager came over and we told him that we thought we had been overcharged.  He was very arrogant, rude and belligerent.  He reluctantly took our check behind the counter and came back a few minutes later.  He told us that the order had been rang up wrong but that we had not been charged for a side salad and that we actually owed money.  And, he was a real jerk about it. But, the more I thought about it the angrier I got.  I asked a waitress for a pen and a menu.  I told her how big of a jerk the manager was and she agreed commenting that he was the owners brother. I added up what we had gotten and it was obvious that we had been overcharged.  I asked another waitress if the owner or another manager was there.  She told me that another manager was there, so I asked that she come over to our table.  I told her what had happened and showed her my receipt.  She went behind the counter, totaled it up and I saw her show the \"jerk\" manager the total.  She came back to our table and apologized.  She said we had been overcharged and she needed my credit card to refund our money for the overcharge.  Turns out that we had been overcharged by about $4.00.  The arrogant, rude manager never came back to apologize or anything.  What he didn't realize is that my wife and daughter along with many moms and daughters from my daughters dance studio frequently visit the restaurant after dance on Saturdays.  It would be safe to say that they spent collectively several thousand dollars there last year.  Because of his horrible attitude and lack of customer service he may have traded $4.00 and an apology for thousands of dollars in future revenue.  I will not EVER go back.  The pizza was good but it's also good at Portofinos and Bella Fresco down the street.  If the owner allows his brother to treat customers like this it is only a matter of time and this place will be history.  I also sensed from the employees that this guy was a real jackass to work for.  It's a shame that a place with so many good things going for it has such bad management."}
{"text":"I ordered catering from here for new years.  Stromboli, Penne Vodka, Baked Ziti, garlic knots, and a nonas pizza.
The food was a hit.  Everything came labeled with instructions for reheating and everything tasted delicious.
This by far my families favorite place for pizza and bow its my go to place for catering."}
{"text":"I'm not from NY, but I do enjoy NY Style pizza.  As most of us are painfully aware, NY style pizza is nearly impossible to come by in this area.  However, Brooklyn makes a very good NY Style pizza!  They have a great crust, they season their pizzas just right, and they use the perfect amount sauce (and the sauce isn't too sweet!).   Pizza can be ordered by the pie or the slice.  For those Gluten Free folks...they offer a gluten free personal-sized pie, too.

I am also a fan of their garlic knots...delicious pieces of baked dough that is smothered in garlic butter/oil and seasoning.  Served with marinara...excellent!

I have also had their Calzones and been very pleased and their Oil & Garlic pasta is delicious!

I have been to several events that were catered by Brooklyn and have thoroughly enjoyed it!  Baked Ziti, Tortellini Alfredo, Chicken Parm....all very good!

We have dined-in only a couple of times and the service was very good both times.  The place is always very busy and there can be a heft wait for a table on a Friday or Saturday night....especially during little league season.   They have nice outdoor seating area as well.

Nice little neighborhood spot for very good pizza and pasta.  I would also like to recognize them for their support of the community and the local schools.   I have seem them step up to assist with many local town and school events and fundraisers."}
{"text":"So the cheese pizza is good. That is their redeeming factor. Oh the cheese tortellini was pretty good too but with extra parm cheese and red pepper flakes. The \"vodka\" sauce is nothing more than bland marinara and a splash of cream. Their Caesar salad is like store bought Kraft dressing but worse. The Greek salad was decent.  And sorry to the people who didn't end up with half their order because it was given to us instead, your calzone wasn't great either. Anyway the water is probably the best thing on the menu. ?"}
{"text":"Been twice BIG disappointment both times. Sausage Stromboli is microwaved then put in oven just a raw doughy mess! Pizza is just ok! Crust overlooked and can't eat it! But what really bothered me was staff. Girl at counter great big smile. Chef on cellphone entire time and making his own lunch not paying attention to customers orders. Saw No passion just slap it around on a plate and here it is. Go from cell phone to your food with no hand washing! Just did not feel like it was any better than your everyday pizza place, just get it done! Sorry hoped and really wanted better just didn't happen!"}
{"text":"Best Around.
I've been to NYC, this is Close to That pizza.
Some folks believe Indian Land has a good option but I myself was not convinced nor converted.
Thanks for the Real Deal!!
See Ya Soon."}
{"text":"Great food but horrible staff after the management leaves. I waited 5 minutes while they were on there phones and talked to each other and ignored my request for a box."}
{"text":"The pizza is alright, but the prices are WAY too high. Today, however, I ordered the eggplant parm hero and the eggplant was bitter, mushy, and undercooked. I complained and got another one for free, but it was just as undercooked as the first one. I gave them a second chance and they blew it. I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"We tried to place a to go order of a whole pizza and a couple pastas. I asked for a side of Alfredo sauce and they refused. I was fine with paying for it but they still refused to let me have some on the side or to have half tomato half Alfredo- even for an upcharge. The sauces are both too overpowering to have all of one and their refusal to let us order both made us take our dinner order elsewhere. Crazy to not allow a customer to purchase what they want."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Charlotte! Make sure to order the pin wheels and thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Not bad, not great.

Pizza comes in only one size - 18 inch, 8 slices which is HUGE. Pizza was cooked alright. Ingredients seemed fresh, though it certainly was not something that woke-up my senses. Atmosphere is a bit run-down and could use some renovating. 

To be honest, the whole experience was a little disappointing. If the atmosphere is going a little down (not too lively, just a hole in the wall) at least the food could be better. menu choices are limited. Maybe it is the way it is presented (you have to review a menu before ordering even when at the counter).

We probably will not be back."}
{"text":"If you like clams their \" pasta con vongole\" (pasta and clams) is one of the best ive had this side of the Atlantic. Atmosphere is typical fast food. Nothing special but the food is one step up from average pizzeria food in my opinion., 

One of the few places you can get Sicilian \"ORANGINI\" - Fried rice balls with mozarella, tomato and peas inside. YUM!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great salads, good size slices, ravioli and penne cooked al dente. Clean tables and attentive service. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"First and last time I'll be visiting, we ordered a regular pepperoni pizza with baked ziti, bread knots and a salad, none of it was tasty. The ziti tasted like chef boyardee out of a can, the salad was out of a bag with some stuff thrown on top and the knots tasted like they got them out of a box and toasted them. The service is horrible, I asked for a plate and was completely ignored so I got up and got it from their little cart, along with the extra silverware and boxes for the pizza. I don't think they came by one time. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Too Expensive! 
My husband paid $40 for one pizza and a spaghetti entree, no garlic bread, just a piece of bread thrown in the bag and not even wrapped up!
The pizza was WAY too greasy, but I'm giving 2 stars, because after getting the grease off with a paper towel, the pizza made a nice breakfast and the taste was pretty good. Spaghetti came with one meatball, had very little sauce and was just okay."}
{"text":"The owner of this place is an butt hole. I don't eat alot of fries, so I asked the lady to give me a half order and I would pay regular price.  She said I will charge you a 1.00 since you only want have. The owner went ape sh:t over a dollar. I told the lady to come get the 1.00 and everything should be good. He is still bitching about the whole damn thing. I will not come back. The pizza is good though."}
{"text":"All anyone needs to know is Brooklyn has the best pizza in Charlotte. It really is that simple."}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout couple weeks back and they gave us wrong order which was a way over cooked cheese. 
Called it in to let them know for the other customer, but accepted the issue. 
Then, Takeout tonite they gave us barely cooked slop. Was inedible garbage."}
{"text":"We came for the breakfast. It's really inexpensive, but very limited menu. The staff was nice and attentive. The adults and kids were happy with the experience. I hear it's not bad for lunch, so maybe we'll be back for that at some point."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place. Service was good. Good came out quickly! 

The antipasto salad was delicious, but and satisfying. 2 people could share it!

The calzone was very good, they have great dipping sauce. 

Overall it's a great place. Lots of seating (but not many booths). We'll come back again!"}
{"text":"My first time going to Brooklyn Pizza.  I called ahead and ordered a Sicilian Pizza to go.  Pizza was horrible.  Dough was like sandwich bread, pizza didn't have enough sauce as it was really dry.  It was a very bad experience.  Stay away from the Sicilian Pizza."}
{"text":"It's about time I review this awesome pizza parlor. It has been a regular spot for us for long time. So long that they pretty much know our order and special topping requests. 

5 star for food quality and promptness in service. Pizza Nonna is my favorite and its crusty edges and soft base is good. Their sauce is flavorful and definitely made fresh. We have tried once to get to-go order but the experience is much better dine-in."}
{"text":"We have two small kids so it's loud and affordable and fun.

The food is incredible. I only give it three stars because of the staff. They are mostly young and don't really have a lot of initiative or anticipate needs. Oftentimes they'll stare blankly into space or  talk/laugh with each other or watch tv while we have hot food and no silverware and empty drinks.

Other than that we love it. The food makes up for the staff. And every once in a while you'll spot Greg Olsen and his family on a Friday night. 

We are in there all the time and see the owner talking to a lot of people. He seems like a great guy - genuinely loves his customers. He's never talked to us, but that's alright"}
{"text":"I've eaten here plenty of times.  Their Za or pizza is nearly identical to the pie I grew up with at John's Pizza of Norwood, NJ.  Good Za.

The waitstaff (highschool girls) can be a little goofy but easily forgotten when Za is served."}
{"text":"This is the closes I can get to Philly pizza as I can get. First time I got the stuffed Pizza. It came with sauce. It was good but I put my in the oven to be a little melty. I tried their cheese steak which is okay but it is not philly. If I hook it up next time it will probably bump. Their Brooklyn pizza is good. My husband wanted a pizza with just tomatoes and he liked it."}
{"text":"It's Pizza - not bad, but nothing to call New York about!  The service is good, it's easy to bring a large group of kids in and grab a slice of pie, eat, and go.  Better than dominos/pizza hut but they don't deliver.  Their garlic knots are good, and they have their pepperoni pinwheels that are a tasty appetizer as well.  Beer selection is minimal, but they do offer pitchers!

Greg Olsen used to come here every Friday night, but since he moved he probably won't be sited anymore."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very casual, buy they do make some great pizza."}
{"text":"Very good pizza (large slices) and subs.  Great atmosphere.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Really good food always consistent and arguably the closet thing to real NY style pizza in the area. The entrees are always good and the chicken cutlet dangerous is always a5god choice.

And their sweet tea by Java Jeff is the best on a hot day!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend going to this place. The waitress last night treated us rudely. When we said it was going to be take-out, she was abrupt and stated it would be 20 minutes, I replied \"No problem\" then she asked if we waiting, and I said \"yes\". She then asked my husband the same thing. He said , yes but then got snarky with him. His comment was are you always this rude? She then gave him his money back and told him to leave. We did, and had a wonderful pizza meal at BRIXX!!!!!"}
