{"text":"Love this place...! Amazing food and amazing staff. Easy to afford and gives special students discounts.  Close to where I live and variety of options to choose from. Philly stake is my favourite."}
{"text":"They have the best honey garlic wings in town! Always call ahead as theres about a 15 mins wait..but oh so worth it..;)"}
{"text":"RUDE!!! Tried to order over the phone. They were very rude and hung up on me! I had to call back and the female I spoke to had not even placed my order. I had to re-order.  Half the topping I wanted were out of stock.   Not worth trying."}
{"text":"Quality and quantity, great and fast service and the price is right. We ordered the spicy chicken burger which has quite the kick in spice factor and chicken on rice was sauced up deliciously on top of that carby goodness.  Chicken on rice with soda is $9.99.  Great value. Check out their menu, they've got great selection and family meals that fit a budget that doesn't sacrifice taste.  It's advisable to call ahead and place an order for pick up, the place has limited seating and you get a nasty cold draft from the opening and closing of the door as the place pulls in crowds at a time, from first timers to locals for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This walk-in type restaurant has A LOT of varieties. Its a pizza n sandwhich type place.  The guys took their time to make me my Philly Cheesesteak sandwhich.  I asked them to use mozzarella instead of processed sliced cheese.   The meat was tender and thinly sliced.   There is little seating.  They take credit card btw.   I would recommend and I would return."}
