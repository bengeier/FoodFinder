{"text":"Jimmy's has the best happy hour. The owners are there a lot and actually talk to the customers.  The map in iPhone had the wrong address; they're actually on the NE corner of Gilbert and Pecos."}
{"text":"This neighborhood haunt was exactly what we were looking for - Italian cuisine, close to where we live, a casual environment, a bar and good variety on their menu.   The service and staff were above average.   The antipasto salad was very good as was the dinner salad.  The lasagna was to die for and a very healthy portion.  The spicy red sauce was just right - can't wait to try their pizza.   The lunch size of the ravioli was a little small but equally tasty.  They don't automatically bring you bread but will if you ask for it.  Price range was a little high for lunch."}
{"text":"Went to New location for Jimmys of Chicago in Gilbert AZ. Didn't like it at all. Service was poor and food was not as good as original location.  We started going to original location when they first opened up and liked it very much.  It is much more of a bar scene instead of a restaurant.  Would not come back!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  Terrible service.  They forgot to bring out silverware after serving our salads.  They brought out our dinner literally 90 seconds after serving us our appetizer.  Then they brought out a meal we did not order.  Now for the food.  The lasagna was swimming in an ocean of sauce that tasted worse than the sauce you get in a supermarket.  My meatball sandwich had a grand total of one and a half meatballs  (three halved meatball slices) on the entire sandwich and my daughter could not eat her chicken fingers because they did not taste right.  How can you mess up chicken fingers?"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is my go-to place when I am in the mood for the Italian.   So far I've had the gnocchi with vodka sauce (my favorite), pizza, eggplant parm with spaghetti and the chicken parm sandwich. All four have been delicious. The portions are large so I always eat half at the restaurant and save the other half for lunch.  The service is also wonderful. Every server I've encountered in very polite and attentive.  If you are in the mood for some filling food, this is the place to go. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was good like always! They have different lunch specials everyday and the family atmosphere is what draws me back everytime."}
{"text":"Went there with a large group in the extra room for Bunco. Our server was very good and attentive, but it ends there. The food was horrible. We had salad, penne pasta with tomato sauce. some linguine dish and lightly breaded chicken breasts as our buffet meal. The salad was ok....hard to mess that up. The penne with tomato sauce was just that..penne pasta with what looked and tasted like canned crushed tomatoes. No seasoning what so ever and I ended up adding salt (I never salt my food), very bland. The linguine dish was noodles in an oily broth like sauce that had random mozzarella cheese melted on top and canned looking plain diced tomatoes...again no seasoning or flavor. My mom said she had a garlic clove in her serving...I tasted no garlic or any other flavor for that matter. The chicken was plain lightly breaded breast that was...if you can believe it, so salty it was nearly inedible. I ate the chicken with the linguine just to give the linguine flavor. This place was packed and for the life of me I don't know why. If all the food is as tasteless as ours was, I don't know why anyone would spend their money here. I was looking forward to trying this place because I love Italian food, but I am glad this was on someone else's dime because I would have sent my meal back if I was the one paying for it. Would not recommend this one..."}
{"text":"one word is all that is needed for the food  at Jimmy's of chicago,  \"NO!\"  Service was OK but that was the only bright spot."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.! Lousy service, no manager when I found hair/fuzz and rat droppings in food. Refused to refund money. Wow....! Do I need to say more. Eat at your own risk.!"}
{"text":"We visited the new Jimmy's location on 1/24/15 and were very disappointed. We had a party of 8 and had to wait approximately 1 hour for a table even though they quoted us 30 minutes. The larger parties were not moving along quickly and we should have taken this as our hint to get out but we stayed to try the food. We had visited the old location twice and it was just okay but we thought we would give it a chance. My husband and I are born and raised in Chicago so we were hoping for a good experience. The waitress was not very friendly and the food took over an hour to come out. We had no silverware and were told they were rolling it? A drink spilled on our table and our server told us she would get a towel and never came back. We sat and held the tablecloth up so it would not spill in someones lap and no one seemed to care. The food was not impressive at all and the rapini pasta dish could have been used as floss it was so tough. The pasta had no garlic flavor and just tasted like boiled noodles in warm water. The restaurant is also not utilizing their space very well. There were wide open spaces where tables can be placed to make a better use of the get more people in. However, if the service and attitude of the staff stays as is you won't make it long here. We were hoping it would be better since we live right next door but we will visit the other local mom and pops and hope for better service and food."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Mom and pop feel to the place. Friendly staff. The only complaint is that the service falls a little short. Especially if you sit in the row of booths to the left when you first walk in. Not sure what it is about that row but every time we sit there we go for several minutes with empty glasses and no waiter in sight.   Overall its a good place and very family friendly. We will continue to keep this place on the weekly routine."}
{"text":"Not being from Chicago I can't say that this tastes like the real thing BUT I can say that I was delightedly surprised - everything was delicious! Service was great! Tomatoes in my salad were ripe, red and sweet."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here now and I've just sent back my chicken parm. The chicken was flat and tasteless. The noodles that came with it were straight up cold. Not like warm or room temp, but cold with sauce sauce dribbled over the top. The pizza bread as an appetizer looked nothing like the picture and was simply a half of a sub roll with sauce spread on it and a slice of cheese. This is my first time here (and last) and I'm embarrassed for them. The server was good and so was the lemonade....but that's about it.  I could continue my rant but I think you get the gist."}
{"text":"The Place SUCKED Try ed it for lunch Saw it on TV looked good. food could have been good but the cook does not care about his job you can taste it or the boss was off 4 the day.......Ordered the meatball sandy cold meatball chez was only thing hot oh ya the sauce was good..The French Fries was cold and grease tasted like a hour old, told told waiter Did not give a hoot, she ask if I wanted some new ones I told her I felt sick... no Thank You. I sitting by the fire place good view of the Kitchen,Then I got eye balled by the COOK it pissed my off ! you could her tell the the COOK about the Fries .......The Pizza was good if you love very thin crust pizza.The place was very nice inside services was OK...but the are much better places in Gilbert if you like Chicago food PS oh ya had 5 buck off coupon what a joke got the lunch spl the mean you don't get 5 bucks off put this way so 1 glass off house wine 1 soda Med 1 topping pizza Meatball lunch deal 30 bucks with a tip for lunch........  You would think when you tell the waiter that this your 1st time here at Jimmy\"s that She make sure YOU COME BACK AGAIN MEANING DONT SERVE CRAP OUT OF THE KITCHEN....."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Jimmy's many times since it opened. Usually it's just my wife and I, but we have had several family dinners there. The decor is \"Chicago sports bar\", the service is professional, efficient and courteous. The food is outstanding. Much better than the chain Italian cuisine that is abundant in the Valley. This is our \"go to\" place for Italian food in the SE Valley."}
{"text":"Tonight's service was awful!  1 hour for food to arrive, forgot salad,  bread was stail, ate dinner with salad fork  (out of other forks), table next to us, unhappy.  Waited 45 minutes for salad & sandwich. Not good at all! Not sure i will be back!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner Friday night @ Jimmy's of Chicago.  There were six of us. The service was terrible & so was the food.  Pizza's were half done & cold. The Italian beef sandwich was dry and served with a quarter cup of aus jus.  Worst of all though it took 45 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered it.  After about 30 minutes the server came out & apologized and told us food would be out in about 3 minutes.....15 minutes later it arrived.  Don't know what's happened here as this used to be a great eatery.  We've been customers for years but no more."}
{"text":"A great place to go for a game. Go for dinner. Or go on Saturday night and have fun with Tino's karaoke. The staff is always friendly ( Allison is our favorite). The food reminds me of the neighborhood places in Chicago. GREAT and plentiful. Helen and Cary make a drink that lets you know they want you to come back. And it's fun to see the Chicago sports memorabilia. And old Pictures from home. Like the newspaper from the Blizzard of 67. I always make sure to bring visitors to Jimmy's for a good time with great people. From the staff to the patrons. You always feel welcome at Jimmy's of Chicago."}
{"text":"First time here and, being from Chicago, this is a very poor imitation of a Chicago restaurant.  The service was slow and had to ask the server for bread for the mediocre soup they served.  My wife had the baked mostaccioli and it had to be sent back as the cheese wasn't melted.  I had the beef and sausage combo and it was terrible.  If a Chicago restaurant tried to serve a sandwich like this there would be real trouble, if you know what I mean.  If you want a beef sandwich go to Portillo's--that is how it is done and done faster.  Putting some Chicago decorations on the wall doesn't make it a Chicago-type restaurant.  Didn't try their pizza but just heard Lou Malnati's is coming to the Phoenix area.  You want Chicago pizza?  go to Lou's.  They may do a good bar business and that should keep them in business because the food business won't.  Good Chicago food is available in the Valley, just not here."}
{"text":"Came in to Jimmys tonight and sat at the bar and immediately was approached by the owner who kindly introduced himself and his wife, I felt completely welcome. I started off with the Caprese salad (delicious) and then topped of with a sausage, onion, and jalapeño pizza which also was amazing. The owner and his wife made me feel so at home and continued the conversation through out the night. I will most definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and had a great experience.  Service was on point and the food was great! Had the Cavatelli in Vodka sauce and was stuffed.    Found out after we paid that we were actually taken care of and served by one of the owners. Congrats to the owners of Jimmy's for having a great restaurant and for being willing to step in and get their hands dirty with their employees.   Delicious food HUGE portions and great service.   We will be back"}
{"text":"This was out 1st time at your new location.   the waiting area is like a sardine can.  We spent two hours there waiting on a table then waiting on our food.  We have 2 small children so the whole experience was a little stressful.  It shouldn't take 2 hours to enter and exit a restaurant unless you're there with free time.  Will not return!"}
{"text":"Jimmy's is a good \"hidden\" place to eat.  It isn't exactly hiding, there just isn't much near by except the community college, a few car dealerships and a Little Caesars.  The restaurant is very nice, the food is good, the wait staff is personable and rumor has it their Happy Hour is good.    Nothing too out of the ordinary, but a good place to try if in the area.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was good. Customer service nothing to brag about    Had dinner at restaurant and then placed an order to go. Took a while to get the to go order while waiting never got a refill of drinks. Got the order. I know should have checked. Got home and it was the wrong order  dove back to jimmy's. while waiting to speak to someone a server was dealing with seated customer about giving him the wrong order.  When I finally spoke to someone it was like they knew and was looking for the order they gave me. They apologized and brought my order out in seconds. Amazing! But no consideration for their screw up and my inconvenience.  Not even a discount coupon or free appetizer on next visit. Guess it's ok for me to waste my time and gas patronizing their eatery.  Advice. Check the order before you leave the facility"}
{"text":"I recently ate here and had a decent meal.  I ordered an Italian beef Sandwich.  It was good,  but not as good as some other places Ive tried in the valley for Italian Beef (Luke's is my favorite so far).  The bread they serve before dinner was good, although the waitress forgot to bring it out in a timely manner. Bar area looks nice for a casual drink. Ill stop back here again and will probably try one of their pasta dishes or maybe the thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"The food was very mediocre, and bland. The spaghetti was overcooked and mushy, the marinara was watery and the sodas did not taste right. The waitress was very nice but we had to ask the bus boy for napkins. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Good choice if you are looking for a pricier Italian menu. They feature veal entrees and a pretty good assortment of Italian seafood dishes. Their homemade gnocchi and cavatelli are wonderful as well. The service is typically so-so, but the great food keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Beware!!! $19 for a pitcher of beer.  Please Miss Server let customers know this before presenting check.  Plenty of TV's.  Service VERY slow"}
{"text":"So this used to be a \"go-to\" for us to watch Chicago sports but that changed TODAY.   We called last week to make a reservation for the Bears/Packers game today for a table for 8.  They took the reservation over the phone.  When we arrived today, they informed us they no longer take reservations and wouldn't honor the reservation THEY took over the phone.  They seated us at a table really  for 5 with 7 people.  If our 8th would have come, it wouldn't have worked.  To top it off, not all the TVs were on the Bears game so I had to sit twisted to watch it with a pole in the middle of my view of the TV screen.  Then, they opened the roll up door so sitting twisted with an obstructed view and a glare on the TV... way to go Owners! They told us they were trying to attract more people.  They can't accommodate the people who are here.   Food took over 45 minutes to come out... very unhappy and won't be back... especially not for sporting events!"}
{"text":"We go to Jimmy's almost every Sat for dinner and Karaoke. We also go at other times. Their food is good and a lot like Chicago style food. The waitstaff is pleasant. Our favorite waitress is Allison, although they're all pleasant and helpful. I especially enjoy the Chicago sports memorabilia."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out when he heard that the Blackhawks playoff game was going to be on here and that this Chicago bar would be a great atmosphere to watch the game in. I have to say he was right! We got there a little early and the bar area was already packed. We sat in the dining room and looked over the menu. There are not a ton of selections, which I hope meant that the ones they did have were really good. We ordered the mozzarella sticks to start from the happy hour menu. They were not home made, but were very tasty, hot and cooked nice and crisp. The marinara was tasty as well. For our meals we ordered the chicken Balsamico (the special for the night) and the Italian beef sandwich. The pasta dish has 2 chicken breasts that were perfectly cooked over corkscrew pasta with a sweet balsamic sauce covered in roasted peppers and onions for under $12! It was huge! I ate 1/2 and was full! The Italian beef was also decent in size and for under 10 bucks this place was a great value! The atmosphere was really fun. As the Hawk game went back and forth the whole place cheered and erupted when they scored. Even the owner was at the bar for most of the game. He came over and talked to us for awhile and is a really nice guy! We are glad we decided to try this local joint and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Jimmy's is one of our favorite local Italian hangouts - we come here at least twice monthly. Had another great meal - chicken parm, side salad with creamy garlic dressing and a couple of bud lights...a nice break from thanksgiving leftovers! Definitely try it if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Just had dinner last night here.  The Pinot Grigio just ok BUT THE FOOD was really good.  I would receomend this resturant to anyone."}
{"text":"Decent food, not fantastic. Poor service. Got the order wrong not only on mine twice but nearby tables as well.  They claim they have Dr Pepper but it's really Mr Pibb.   Bottom line is it's good if you're hungry but I probably won't return. If I do it will be for the cheese bread."}
{"text":"I've been to Jimmy's a few times and have given up on it.  The first experience was just really awful- like include salad with your order and wait twenty minutes for it to arrive awful.  (Nor were they really busy, so no excuse there.)    The second time I ordered a sausage dish.  The crack brain trust that runs the place basically put it on a dish/saucer that wasn't big enough to move the thing about easily, so eating it was not as simple as you'd expect, nor was it a particularly memorable sausage.  The third time was the best of the three but they simply didn't have it in them to recover the interest and good will that earlier visits had cost them.   Avoid."}
{"text":"Twice now I have gone to Jimmys to watch Blackhawks game only to get turned away at the door, even though the place was almost empty and i was over an hour early they wouldn't seat us, apparently they reserve all the tables for regulars, I took this as rude and uncalled for. Wont be going back, not even for the Bears games. Big Thumbs Down"}
{"text":"Here is a follow up to my earlier review. So the entire dining experience took 2 hours. Walked in at 6:10 and left at 8:05. The food came at the 1 1/2 hour mark and was only ok. One person at the table ordered a salad with his entree and that took 45 min. to make it to the table even though he had canceled it 15 min. before it came, I guess they still wanted to get the sale because they still charged us in the end for it. While having plenty of time to observe, I noticed a manager/ owner standing around talking with a waiting customer/ friend for 25 minutes. I guess instead of jumping in to help get the process moving faster he thought that was more productive. I definitely understand trying to find your groove in the new place, but after being open 10 days nobody should have to spend 2 hours trying to get something to eat. Once again after having plenty of time that night and talking with other tables that had plenty of time also, it sound like other people didn't like the idea of waiting that long to eat either. To be fair, I will try it one more time because I believe everybody deserves a second chance, but as always, first impression go a long ways."}
{"text":"YUM!!! Had only been to the old location once and remember it being...eh. Came here tonight because we saw they had patio seating, and being so nice out wanted somewhere to sit outside. They have 20+ beers on tap and a happy hour to boot. We tried the Dunkelweisen beer....SOOO good!! Tried the pizza, calamari, pasta x 2 and a few beers. Pasta sauce could use a little more Italian spice, otherwise everything was A++. Plenty of TVs to watch any games on. Josh was our server and was awesome. We had kids with us and he was very accommodating to us and them.  Will def be back again."}
{"text":"This place is just not good.  I have tried it twice and both times have been disappointed with the fact that they cannot do even the most basic foods well."}
{"text":"The food was not good.  The owner sat at the bar and badgered the employees and customers. I ordered the stuffed mushroom and they were mushy and flavorless.   The \"homemade\" gnocchi was brutal.  I think they may have frozen it and recooked it.  I am not sure how they are still open."}
{"text":"Avoid this pit. The pizza is the only saving grace, their pasta is overdone and mushy, the sauce was lukewarm and tasted like some spilled a whole salt shaker in it. My server ignored us the whole time and spent all her time chatting up a regular. My silverware had small pieces of food stuck to it and when I asked for a new set the server rolled their eyes. Worst service and food I have ever gotten I hope you avoid this horrid place at all costs. Owner was the loudest drunk at the bar, constantly barking orders at employees. Guess he's too busy playing Cheers to run a decent business."}
{"text":"Server never came to the table so we had to order from the bar ...twice. Worst DJ ever - no clue how to mix or transition from one song to the next."}
{"text":"This was our third visit and I have to say the service is impeccable. They are attentive, friendly and helpful.   I can't remember what we had our first visit, it was right after they opened and during the awkward stage. The second visit we had pizza it was good, we were looking for deep dish which they don't make but it was good and great service.   Tonight we all had different things: Mostaccioli for my older son he was very happy, cheesy and flavorful sauce. Spaghetti and meatball off the kid's menu for the younger boy, sweet sauce and a big meatball another happy boy. Husband had the Chicago Grinder hot and it was gone in a flash and he said it was really good. It looked great on the toasted bread. He also got a salad instead of fries, lots of fresh veggies. I had the Italian Beef with peppers and onions, it comes with Giardiniera and au jus and french fries. The bread was yummy soft yet substantial enough to withstand au jus. The bread was stuffed, stuffed with meat, the peppers and onions were good but the giadiniera made it. It was a really good sandwich. San Tan Brewery on tap - yum.  I could give them 5 stars but I've had better Italian Beef though I will admit I'm not an expert.   A great dinner and I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Angel hair with vodka sauce--Heaven on earth. Spicy Beef sandwich-delectable. Kerry and Z are rock stars. The best family owned restaurant and so generous. Love these people and I love their place."}
{"text":"First of all, my wife and I are from Chicago and live a block from here, so we would love to see this establishment succeed. Sadly, it is failing miserably. We have been here numerous times. Usually to get a bite to eat and watch a Blackhawk game. When attempting to do this last night it was a debacle. First, they were out of high chairs for our one year old...I guess that will happen once in a while. We requested to be seated outside because it was a little less hectic out there. There are three TV'S and they all were showing a meaningless college football game. Us as well as the other few tables of people all requested the Hawks game and the NFL game ( the only two real games on at the time). 3 different employees told us they tried but they couldn't and the bartender refused.   The food quality is really hit or miss depending on your choice. I can say the pizza and Italian Beef are decent....everything else is blah. They have a couple decent craft beers on tap out of a selection of 20, but they should rotate some of these more regularly.   My suggestion would be to just wait until a Chicago teams playoff game and sit at the bar and watch the only big TV'S they have and just stick with the beer here.....that is if there is a a seat available because because most of the spots are reserved for the owners friends and regulars. If I were to open a Chicago themed establishment right next door, it would put them out of business....and I have no industry experience !!!! Like I said, I would love for this establishment to turn it around, because there is nothing I want more in my neighborhood than a sweet Chicago joint"}
{"text":"A good neighborhood joint with decent food.   They could improve the bread, though.   Great place for a quick bite. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were about to head over to native New Yorker for wings, but the retail lady suggested that we go and try this place out. Figured we were not too far away and I have to say, I'm glad we did! I noticed lot of people are combining about their service, but I didn't think it was that bad. Wings were delicious! They grill them so it gives it an extra kick. I'm definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"It took 2 visits to Jimmy's. First trip(Saturday afternoon) - walked in and a sign at the hostess stand said \"please seat yourself\". Not a problem. We found a table and sat. 30 minutes later, no waiter or waitress. We walked out. Didn't seem too busy. Perhaps, they were short-staffed. Second trip (Thursday night) - Hostess was at attendance. Super busy, about a 10 minute wait. Food and service was awesome! Dish choices were, Clams and pasta(red sauce) and Chicken Marsala. A little hesitant to go back because of the first trip but more-n-likely will return. However, not a quiet place. A little louder than the average restaurants."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant on Gilbert Rd and the food was disgusting! I ordered it To-Go. I ordered a Chicken Parm Sandwich with a side of french fries.  The french fries were cold, hard, burned, dark brown, and stale. When I called the restaurant about it, all they said was \"oh I'm sorry, I'm saw him cook those fresh so I'm not sure what happend.\"  Not even a \"let us re-do those for you\", nothing! So I bit into the chicken parm sandwich and the first couple of bites were fine although I was expecting way more flavor! Once I got to the bottom of the sandwich, the chicken was completely overcooked! The meat was so tough I can hardly get through it. I would have completely thrown this meal away if I wasn't so hungry. I go through what I could but I definitely wish I could speak to a manger and get my money back!"}
{"text":"This place has a great \"neighborhood hangout\" feel with local regulars! Full bar with great beer choices. The menu is Italian inspired with a good variety. There are at least 10 big screen TVs for sports watching also. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We've been to Jimmy's of Chicago several times.  We are originally from Chicago so we are always searching for a restaurant that makes us feel like we are back home.  Jimmy's 100% fills that gap.    Their pizza is Chicago style thin crust pizza.  It's the perfect amount of cheese and sauce.    It's cut into squares which always makes me smile.     The ambiance is the major reason to come back to Jimmy's between the pictures on the wall, the bar that looks authentic and the clientele during a Blackhawks game, you will forget that you are in Arizona. Plus you can't beat having a red and white checkered tablecloth!   I would highly recommend Jimmy's if you are looking for a Chicago restaurant and have a taste for thin crust pizza!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza!  Great service if you are in the restaurant.   Delivery service is AWFUL!! I've ordered delivery twice and both times it took almost 60-90 minutes to get it delivered when I was quoted 30 minutes.   Do not order delivery!  If you want their pizza go and pick it up or eat in the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Chicago bar.  Good place to watch the Chicago games.  Get there early on game day.  Tailgating in parking lot before bears games...cool!    Had beef and sausage combo.  Very good.  Big menu with loads f options.  Will definitely be back to watch some more Chicago games."}
{"text":"I recently was contacted by the proprietors of Jimmy's of Chicago and here is the content of their response to my post. Fair and balanced reporting is what I'm all about so I'm giving them a voice. I have to say that their willingness to address the issue and ask for another chance at my business is admirable and we might just check them out again soon. I'll keep you all posted as to my experiences there. Here is their response in its entirety:  Dear Mr. Shields,  I am sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your dinner here at our restaurant.  I wish you would have shared your concerns with us while you were here as it is of utmost importance to us that all of our guests have a wonderful experience.  We recieve many compliments on our veal dishes and especially on the lasagna.  In fact, the lasagna is one of our best sellers.  Obviously, people have different tastes and perhaps the items you chose are not made in the fashion to which you are accustomed.  We would love you to give us another chance as I think your experience would be much different.  If you are willing to do so, please introduce yourself to either me (Kerry) or my wife (Zalena). We have many regulars who come several times a week and we hope that you and your wife might become one of those.  If not, thank you for your past patronage.    Sincerely,  Kerry and Zalena Kersting"}
{"text":"The food here is good, the staff is friendly, the beer is cold.  What else do you want in a neighborhood Italian joint?  Oh......and they have Peroni on tap!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chicago style food from this native's opinion. I had the cheese ravioli with a side of sausage. Both were delicious and huge servings. My husband had the pizza, which was Chicago thin crust, and he said it was the best he has had in Arizona. We will be back."}
{"text":"Jimmys is a great family restauraunt that has awesome food. My family got a pepper and egg sandwich, Chicken Parm, and the wings and all enjoyed every entree. The bread is also great! We had an awesome server named Josh who took care of us."}
{"text":"So far we have been twice as a family and it has been the perfect spot! No wait, great service and yummy Chicago style food!  Everything is good and the atmosphere is great too!"}
{"text":"The place was nice but the food and service had room for improvement. We had the breaded mushrooms, calamari, and chicken marsala...all of which didn't have much flavor or leave any real desire to return. It wasn't the worst place we've eaten, so I went with 2 stars."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from Jimmy's but haven't patroned it until last Sunday after I bought a Groupon for it. We had walked up to it one night around 9 and when we walked in no one said hi so we figured it was closed.   First off, the place was FREEZING. I don't know if they blast the a/c because another Yelper mentioned it gets toasty, but I was actually shivering. I thought about going to my house for a jacket but just put up with it.   I got the caeser salad which was good, and my husband got the minestone. The appetizers led us on, and we were let down. If it wasn't for the appetizers and the good waitress, I'd give Jimmy's one star.   The meals were over priced. Two meals and 4 pints of beer was $50. I wouldn't have minded paying that much for a good Italian meal, but the food was not worth it.   Cheese ravioli was $14 and the ravioli was good but the sauce, as my husband put it, was like Chef Boyardee. The bread crust was too flaky/hard to chew. Didn't taste freshly baked like most Italian restaurants.   My husband got the pork chop ($16-17) and instead of overloading it with peppers, I suggest they add a side of sorts. The pork chop was very tough and hard to chew and my husband did not like it.   Overall, I'm glad we had a Groupon, and we won't be coming around again unless friends want to go for pizza or something cheaper."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite while on the area. As we entered I was unsure if we could seat ourselves or had to wait.  Took longer than expected but ultimately the young lady behind the bar yelled and said we could sit where we liked.  I must say I was disappointed by the food.  I had the chicken parm sandwich (and fries).  I chicken was hard and a little burned around the edges.  Not enough sauce on the sandwich and just lacking flavor. My friend said the same about the sausage and peppers she ordered.   The portion sizes were great for the price and the server was very pleasant and friendly which is why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"So, I went with some friends and it was not very good.  I had eggplant Parmesan, they asked if i wanted the sauce spicy or regular, I went for spicy... so they took a red pepper shaker from the table and sprinkled it over the regular sauce and ta-da!!! Spicy!!!  I sat there unimpressed.   My eggplant, well I've had better frozen from the grocery store.  My girlfriends food was equally unimpressive... service was ok at best, refills were very slow (kinda a pet peeve) there was nothing about this place that makes me ever want to go back.  There is much better Italian food to be found around town.  Ya, that's all, don't wanna sit here and rip on the place, I just didn't like it."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends!  Awesome atmosphere and food. Travis is the best bartender ever!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in the food at Jimmy's tonight.  My wife and I have eaten here before and liked the food.  Tonight was a much different story.    For an appetizer, we ordered the pizza bread with sliced meatballs.  When it arrived at our table, it was about half of what the picture on the menu showed.  The sauce was flavorless, the cheese was...eh, and the meatball slices tasted like they been around for a week or so.    My wife ordered the lasagna.  It did not look appetizing.  She said the sauce, like on the pizza bread, had no flavor and the dish, overall, was just not good.  I ordered the Linguini a la Jimmy's.  The chef must hate Jimmy.  The dish is suppose to be linguini with tomato, basil, \"fresh\" mozzarella, garlic, and oil. The pasta itself had no taste, like they didn't even salt the water.  There were two small clumps of mozzarella that was anything but fresh.  The wilted green stuff may have been fresh basil at some point, but wasn't by the time it made it's way onto my plate.  There were little pieces of what appeared to be leftover tomato...mostly skin.  Perhaps it was what was left after they strained the canned tomato sauce for the lasagna and pizza bread.  There was no sign of garlic anywhere.  I'm not sure what kind of oil is suppose to be in this dish, but whatever it was, I couldn't taste it.  And the linguine was sitting in what looked like a cup or so of the water it was cooked in.  That was it for me.  I almost always clean my plate when I eat out.  If the food is just okay, I still eat most of it.  I couldn't eat more than a few bites of this.  I'm not the best cook by any means, but my pasta is much better than this stuff.  Try salting the pasta water, add some roasted garlic, real, fresh tomato, actual fresh mozzarella (unclumped), fresh basil, quality olive oil, and DRAIN THE PASTA!!  The pasta shouldn't be swimming a pool of tasteless oil water.  The only good part of the meal was the free bread with olive oil and balsamic.  I'm usually willing to give places a second chance, but I don't think we'll be back here unless it's for karaoke and a drink or two, but we'll eat elsewhere first.  ***Zalena, Yelp will not let me respond to your comment.  We were there on Sunday, September 21, between 5pm and 6pm.***"}
{"text":"This is a great little taste of Chicago in AZ.  The thin crust pizza is a good as many in Chicago.  The beef is a disappointment if you have had a Chicago Beef recently, it will work if want close to Chicago, but avoid if you want the real thing.  I am a regular at Jimmy's we go every Friday, we go three Friday's a month.  When we attended tonight we were told they were completely booked, when we asked to wait, we were told we are completely booked for tonight.  I have never experienced a restaurant that refused to tell me how long the wait was, but rather wanted me to leave.  I am waiting for the next table because I believe that as a regular who attends as frequently as I do, I at least should be told a time rather than encouraging me to leave.  Confused an waiting... At 20 minutes but still waiting... Will post again at the end of tonight's experience."}
{"text":"I'm giving Jimmy's three stars because the young lady that took care of us last night was very good (customer service). But, don't go for the salmon salad or the linguine with white sauce. My wife said the clams were pretty rubbery and the salmon salad, while good, was nothing that I would reorder (overpriced and nothing spectacular). The place seems to do a booming business with locals. Maybe the pizza or other things on the menu are what draw folks in. Nice atmosphere and good service but there is better Italian food to be found in Gilbert.  Fortunately, we were with friends so the food quality was only secondary to the quality of the evening."}
{"text":"Wow... Every karaoke host I know works in new singers but red rock entertainment karaoke host here at Jimmy's says we gotta wait til the rest 13 people sing that she doesn't work in new people Wow We have been here twice before today and have had nothing but positive feedback from the crowd and she acts as if she doesn't know us  The sound is horrifying for some reason tonight too idk if the host is drunk or what  Then unlike any karaoke host I've seen before, she puts her own song in instead of putting a customer first  And my favorite pet peeve is when they adjust the mic for themselves to sound great but Dont for you That's my signal that the host Dont give a shit about anyone but themselves omg  I would always make certain my guests had a better time than me That's just me tho  Wow Won't be back  Had enough of the rudeness and complete lack of conpetency"}
{"text":"What an embarrassment!!  If wanted cold food, I would have ordered an ice cream!  If I wanted tasteless food, I would have order water. The food will go down as the worst I've had since moving to AZ four years ago. The food was bad enough for me to go out of my way and download this app just to leave this review...yes, that's how you know I won't be back. Tasteless tasteless tasteless. Let's just say I returned my food and gave the server the balance on the gift card, since I won't be back. If I were to win a lifetimes supply of their food, I'd give it back bc I wouldn't want my own reputation tarnished by giving it to someone else for them to experience. Read the reviews on their previous location and they had some bad ones there too. I fear that the only good ones are from their friends or regulars who have grown to become comfortable with the place. Basically, this restaurant does not deserve anymore of my time, money or review...."}
{"text":"Two reviews in one here...   First, the restaurant is great, the staff is friendly and the food is excellent. On my first visit, I had the Chicken Limone. Absolutely delicious. That meal made sure I'd be back.   Fast forward about 7 months and I am home on extended sick leave but trying to plan our wedding reception. Having canceled our wedding plans once due to illness, then eloping, my fiance and I knew there was no way we could cancel the reception too. So...I am at home on the computer trying to figure out where we could get food. And Jimmy's came up in a search. Checked out their catering menu online (thank you SO much for having online menus!) and seeing how reasonable the prices are, my husband and I arranged to meet a friend at Jimmy's to try some options.   We chose to try:   -- Cavatelli with Vodka Sauce  -- Sausage with Peppers and Potatoes  -- Eggplant Parmigiana   The cavatelli was eyes-rolling-back-in-your-head delicious. I had chosen this to try because I originally wanted gnocchi but that wasn't offered on the catering menu. So I picked this as a possible substitute and it was amazing! I was willing to fight my husband and our friend to eat all the cavatelli we were sampling.   My husband's pick was the sausage, peppers and potatoes. He is definitely a meat and potatoes kind of guy and this entree fit the bill. The sausage was mildly seasoned, the peppers and potatoes were cooked just right. Yum!   We chose the eggplant parmigiana for a more traditional Italian dish and I'm so glad we did. No bitterness to the eggplant, the tomato sauce was excellent and how can you go wrong with mozzarella cheese all over it?   We ended up ordering all three for our reception. The cost of the trays included racks to put them on, Sterno to keep the food hot and serving utensils. For less than $250, we had enough food to serve about 40 people. What a value!   When my husband went to pick the food up the day of the reception, it was all ready and waiting for him, in fact he said the staff was right there with it so quickly. One of my worst fears was that he'd have to wait for it and we were on a tight time line to have him pick up the food, the cake, the keg, etc.   Our guests LOVED the food. The star of the night was definitely the cavatelli but everything was just wonderful.   I was even glad that we had a few no-shows for the reception because we had leftovers to enjoy for a few days afterward.   This has proven to me that I could eat Jimmy's food every day of the week and still want more.   Thank you so much, Jimmy's!"}
{"text":"Pay no attention to the negative reviews! At the same time, there is some truth to this being a small place with limited parking and a postage stamp sized bar.  The ravioli is to die for - that's what my lovely lady gets every time. I try to switch it up but I'm in a spaghetti rut. The cool thing is you get to choose from about a half dozen sauces.   Not in the mood for pasta? I tried the pizza and it's not bad but... I wasn't thrilled. However, the meatball sandwich? Yum! Good luck finishing that beast!"}
{"text":"So far in the evening I'm not impressed. The acoustics are horrible, crowded night but still every voice carries and we were forced to move outside. The bread is ok, almost tastes like regular store loaf not fresh made which I expected. House salad was normal, nothing note worthy positive or negative. I had the fettucini Alfredo, horrible, runny sauce and literally no flavor to it at all. Didn't even continue eating after first couple bites. Wife had ravioli with red sauce, still very little flavor and was cool temperature wise. We will not return. On a positive note, the staff was fantastic.  Friendly and works hard and quick. They were able to move us outside and went to Walgreens to replace propane for heater. I was going with one star but wife convinced me the servers deserved another."}
{"text":"Great pizza and Chicago style food.   It has the small time bar feel.   Great place to watch any Chicago games.   They also have catering and great food and happy hour specials."}
{"text":"The pizza is disgusting.  The overpowering smell of pungent Parmesan takes over so you can't even try it.  And it will smell up your car and house.   I would rather have Little Cesar's pizza.   So gross."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place.  I had cheese ravioli and the sauce is literally just tomato paste!  No flavor what so ever!  The bread was stale as well.  I used to love the food here, but it has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"This place is Great!  I took my family there Sunday morning to watch some football and eat breakfast/lunch.  The atomsphere was good and the food was awesom. I know it is an Italian place but I had an omelette with green pepers onion ham and cheddar.  It was unbelieveable and I am guessing it had at least 4 eggs. Kid friendly for football as well.  I would go there again and probaly will on Sudnay!"}
{"text":"We ordered pepper jack sticks and they were surprisingly soggy.    The chicken caesar salad I had was yummy but the chicken was cold.    The pizza my hubby ordered (white pizza with crumbled sausage) looked good.  He said he really liked it but they used olive oil instead of alfredo sauce.  The crust was thin, crispy, and homemade.  He stated the best part about it was the cheese and sausage.  My mom-in-law had the fettucinnie alfredo and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The food is OK, but nothing special.  We had a chick parm entree and a spicy Italian beef sandwich.  The prices for food seem a bit inflated.  The service was OK too except our server knew very little about the menu or the happy hour offerings.  The place was not crowded at all on the night we visited.  My real complaint is with drink prices.  I ordered a pint of San Tan draft beer which had a price tag of $7.75 when the check arrived.  I can get the same beer, same size, at several local restaurants nearby for $4-4.50.  So my suggestion is to put those prices on the menu if they are going to be that outrageously high.  That is absurd and the waitress seemed embarrassed when I questioned it."}
{"text":"We Love this place and the owners!  The deep dish pizza is excellent!  Oregano's watch out you have huge competition!"}
{"text":"This place is a complete unorganized sh*t show. The service is horrific, and the bathroom smells like they have a serious sewage problem. I came here while visiting and will be sure not to again. -_- I can for sure confirm that the reviews on here are pretty accurate. We have been sitting here for an hour after the non existent hostess seated a group of two who got here 30 minutes after us at a large table with two chairs then pulled the extra chairs to the waiting area.......... we had four. We could have fit."}
{"text":"I took my 9 year old to Jimmy's for a date night.  We wanted to try it and there was a Groupon for it.  I was honestly very surprised the rating was so low.  We had a really great experience.  We were seated right away and everyone was very friendly.  The service was really great as not only was our waitress checking on us but it seemed to be a team effort as other waitresses also asked about our drinks, etc.  The food was delicious and fresh!  The mozzarella sticks were the best I've ever head.  The breading is light and really yummy.  We also shared the side ceaser salad and again it was delightful with the thick flakes of Parmesan.  Our main course was the thin crust pizza.  We did half ham and half pineapple.  It was the best thin crust pizza I've ever had and they don't skimp on the cheese either.  The ham was a little spicy but other than that, wow pallet pleasing.  I would highly recommend you check this place out as it's a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Jimmy's,  I placed an order for a combo sandwich to go.  It wasn't what I'm used to being from Chicago,  however it wasn't terrible.  I'm used to the beef being shaved,, much thinner than I was served, the sausage was really good, overall sandwich was dry.  The fries were cooked perfect and the giardiniera was better than most I've had in AZ.   I will most likely be back to try something different next time."}
{"text":"so after a long week my husband and i decided to try something new.  we stopped here at jimmys of Chicago  gilbert. i wanted a combo of two different dishes in one because im picky like that.  the waitress had no problem, she went and told the cook what i wanted and he made it happen. this was amazing food, good prices, great service. we will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"My family loves Jimmy's. We eat here often and enjoy the staff, owners, and, of course, the pizza! They always go out of their way to treat us with kindness and serve us like we're family.  Some of our favorites: pizza, cavatelli with vodka sauce, wings, antipasto salad, and toasted raviolis!    Their beer list has been expanded in the new location and we enjoy all their different brews on tap.  This is Italian well done, Jimmy's!!!"}
{"text":"Dont know why such low stars! Best thin crust pizza, loaded with topping Ive had around town. Our waitress was the sweetest most attentive weve had in a while, 2 small kids with us and she was so sweet with them! We will definitely be making this a regular!"}
{"text":"I've been to Jimmy's 5 times. The Italian Beef Sandwich and Spicy Baked Mostaccioli are awesome. I don't care for the lasagna or gnocci, but that's more personal preference. The owners are great and very friendly! I love the live entertainment and midwest/Chicago atmosphere. I recommend it."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend after my son's game (which they lost) with a bunch of the other player/families. It's a great place to go for a large gathering (they have a semi-private area that can be a party room) or even just with the family. The atmosphere is nice and they have enough TVs so that you can probably watch whatever game you're interested in. Service was really good and our large party with 5-6 separate checks didn't confuse the staff - they got everything right.  Good Italian food - I can't figure out the pricing structure. The Capri salad I had which was only 4 small pieces was $8. For about the same price my son got a cheeseburger with fries and I also noticed the chicken parm is about the same cost too. Most of their dinner entrees are reasonable at around $12. The pizza is good, but I wasn't paying attention to the pricing on that - sorry.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went in to try some pizza and wings and I was surprised to find a pretty big menu of italian food. Wings were big and meaty. And our pizza(italiansausage, mushroom, black olives) hit the spot. Lots of cheese and I can't complain about that. Only thing was the crust could have used an extra ten in the oven but still good. Plan to go back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars this place would get it. Horrible Service!!! I don't think it was our waitress but that kitchen was a mess.  Orders came out wrong and out late. My wife's plate first followed by 18 mins for the rest of our party.   Wine was wrong. 2nd glass. Was fair.  The manger never came out to apologize. Seriously???  Last time for me. They were out of Shrimp on Friday night???  Wow.  This place needs to get it together."}
{"text":"A great representation of a local Chicago eatery, with a menu packed full of traditional Chicago eats.  Having just moved from Chicago a year ago, I tend to rate the quality of a  place based on the quality of their Italian Beef sandwich.  This place is no Portillo's or Luke's(in terms of beef sandwiches), but it is still quite tasty.  I recommend a side of hot peppers and a side of beef juice for dipping.  Good size clean place with Chicago memorabilia on the walls, and very nice staff.  Overall, their rock solid menu and full bar make this place a solid 4."}
{"text":"A very friendly place where patrons like to drink and eat.  Several Tv's to watch and you can eat at the bar if you wish.  The food is Italian, so you can have your Pizza, Chicken wings, or any Italian dish of your choice.  The service is great as we never had to look for our server or bartender.  If you want fun and casual dining, this is the place to go to when you are in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Save yourself a trip and the expense and pass on this place unless you are going to be drink, drank, drunk watching a game. After 2 opportunities this place is off my list. Sadly because I always want to support the little guy especially a Chitown one at that."}
{"text":"We've been to Jimmy's twice in the last couple of months and it's been consistent both times. My husband LOVES Veal Parmigiana but has a hard time finding places that do it right. This place does it right! Thin cut, never dry. I've had a smattering of things. Lasagna-Good, not great. I like a drier lasagna and this has alot of sauce Gnocchi with vodka sauce-Really Good. Not overcooked, lots of sauce Friends have had:  Chicken Limone: This was excellent. Just the right amount of lemon. Wish there were capers, but thats ok.   We've had wings(hot)-Very good! Asked for well done and that's exactly how we got them. Fried Ravioli: Just ok. Typical fried food Rapini and Beans: Very Good! I could eat this as a meal with some angel hair pasta.   Overall, this is a good place for pretty good food. I don't leave feeling like I ate a brick because it sits so heavy. Also like the ambiance of this place but I'm a Bears fan, so I feel right at home. :)"}
{"text":"Dropped in for some dessert, CHEESECAKE, and I knew an Italian joint would be able to suit my needs. Waitress was great, friendly & kept checking up on me. Recommended adding chocolate & candied walnuts to my dessert & I accepted. I left fat & happy. Now I just have to drop in to see if they represent Italy to its fullest"}
{"text":"GREAT food, GREAT staff, GREAT atmosphere. The owners are very friendly and they interact with everyone. It is my new goto dining facility!!!!"}
{"text":"Very VERY average. Actually disappointed in the braciole. Kelsey with the pretty smile and form fitting shorts would probably make me think about going back and trying something different."}
{"text":"Jimmy's is a long way from home for me. Even my GPS refused to find this place for me. But a quick phone call helped straighten out the directions. This place is owned by a nice couple that used to live in Chicagoland. There was about a 20 minute wait on a busy Saturday night; not a big deal for me.  Thanks to Robyn N. for telling me about this place. I was jonesing for some Chicken Vesusvio. I guess Chicken Vesusvio is a Chicago creation dating back to the Depression. So I was excited to actually have one of my favorites since I haven't been to Chicago in a few months.  I thought the pricing was fair and the dish itself was good (3 1/2 stars) but not the greatest. I would  probably try some other dishes before I ordered it again. For example, their Pizza looked awfully good as all the families seemed to have ordered pizza. I thought the service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"One star is generous.  Lost our gift card.  Lost our credit card.  Servers friends were clearly in on it when we complained.  Do NOT go here"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I really, really wanted to like Jimmy's but I just couldn't.  Perhaps it's due to the Chicago vs New York food war that has been waged for decades and me being a native NY'er made me dislike it.  But IMO, there are definitely better italian restaurants. It is edible but that's about it. Service was spotty, food was mediocre.  It's even funny when you read previous reviews from native Chicago-ans who didn't like it....that should tell you something."}
{"text":"It was a meal of highs and lows.  This casual sit-down eatery had no shortage of Chicago memorabilia or senior citizen patrons.  It's like they're going head-to-head against NY54 Pizza over in Sun Lakes.  The mussels in red sauce were a FANTASTIC appetizer.  The spicy, garlicky (sp?)sauce was a great complement to the perfectly cooked mussels.  I wish I got the full pound instead of the half.  I also wish they served bread or even another bowl for the shells.  My wife's pasta fagioli was not nearly as appetizing.  It tasted like Campbell's tomato soup with a few noodles and cannellini beans thrown in.The house salad was standard, but at least it was fresh and crisp.  The vinagrette was a little tart for my taste.  We split a pizza.  The subtle notes of the crispy thin crust and tangy tomato sauce were solid, but they were totally overwhelmed by a thick layer of bland cheese.  Toppings were sparse.  The homemade tiramisu was good, but not great.  It was a little too whip creamy, and am I the only one who doesn't like chocolate sauce over tiramisu?  I want to savor the coffee flavor, not the Hershey's syrup.  In summary, I'd go back.  Anything in their tomato sauce is bound to be good, especially the spicy version.  Try the mussels.  Pass on the pizza and the pasta fagiole."}
{"text":"Today (Sunday, took my Bride and Granddaughter here for some Chi Town style pizza . We got a large pie with Pep Onion Garlic, sausage. X Cheese w/fresh basil,  and a small pep pizza for the young one.  I asked about the style of pie served, and was told they dont deal with deep dish food, so it's Chicago thin all the way.  I talked to our very awesome server, who confided in me that just a bit before someone had complained because they were from New York and eat New York Pizza's, which begs the question of why they went to Jimmy's of CHICAGO. I ask these questions Myself, I love deep dish pies, and had never had a thin Chi-Pie, so was looking forward to something different. I will now approach the review as if it was a middle of the road Chicago pie, I mean sheesh, we are in Arizona after all. Not a bad pie, but overall, I found it sorta bland.A little red paper flakes helped, but there just wasn't any depth to it. and for some reason, the sweated down onions had a weird consistency to me. I liked the people working there, everyone was easygoing, good with my kid, and dealt with my immaturity well. 8^) I found the dough to be bland as well. Perhaps that's the style, and nothing was wrong. They do have an extensive menu, and I want to go back and eat either a Veal Parmigiana or steak and cheese sandwich. Something different off the menu, maybe ask the owner if they are there what they recommend. As for me, the pizza may not be my taste, but with the high level of quality of food, the extensive menu, And the very nice staff, I'm more than willing to go back on a quiet weeknight and enjoy a Chicago style pasta meal and salad."}
{"text":"Service was SLOW!  We waited over 40 min and the place was not even that crowded.  When the food came it was very low quality.  Tasted like rubber and sodium.  I noticed others around me were not enjoying their food either.  My girlfriend only took a bite and was unable to finish.  I expected the food to be cheap and low quality because thats the kind of place this seems to be but it was worse than I thought.  It is cheap so if you are poor then this is your place.. just dont expect to enjoy it. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Guess what? Jimmy's serves breakfast! Yes, it's true. They do! And yes, I was actually at Jimmy's early enough in the morning to witness the breakfast menu. And guess what? The breakfast is good!   Imagine breakfast with an Italian twist. Imagine an omelet with pepperoni -- toast replaced with Italian bread -- a breakfast sandwich within an Italian hoagie. Do you have a good picture in your mind? Then you've got breakfast at Jimmy's.   Here's a word of warning. The breakfast is huge! It's large, delicious and in charge. The omelet takes up the entire plate. The breakfast sandwich is the size of a Philly cheese steak. The breakfast parfait is in a large bowl. But, each bite is delicious.   So, next time you're up early, you're in the area and you're hungry for a hearty breakfast, check out Jimmy's!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were excited to try this place out, it's right by our house and several friends recommended it.  I have to say, it was not as good as I was hoping.  There was nothing really \"wrong\" with the experience, but there was nothing really \"WOW\" about it either.  The staff was nice, so that was a plus.  However, I was not impressed with the food (maybe it was our choices).  Both dishes we ordered were bland, the bread they serve is nothing special, there was just nothing that stood out as great.  I was surprised at the prices too, about $45 for an appetizer, 2 entrees and waters (not including tip).  My fiance said he would go back to try pizza or something else, as for me, if I want yummy Italian food, I'm going to Pestos (another place I have Yelped about)!"}
{"text":"Went for football and breakfast and although I know they are known for dinner I expected more. We get here and the waitress has no idea about the menu, we order bottomless mimosas and she brings a bottle of champagne and a container of OJ! The French toast was yummy but I ordered pancakes: they were burnt, cold and yucky. We asked for a manager and he came over and simply expressed \"no one has ever complained about our breakfast\" never even apologized  we were meeting a group of 10 but left and went somewhere else!! If you like crappy food and really bad service then this is your place!! The manager was John! So the manager bold faced lied and said his name was John and apparently he is the owner Kerry! Way to treat customers WTF"}
{"text":"We went here a couple of weeks ago for karaoke and drinks.  I started with the house white which was awful.  Changed to Amaretto Sours and was okay.    The KJ was okay and lots of people sang.  Took about an hour before I got up there from the time I put in a slip.  Seems he doesn't quite understand how to add new people into a rotation.  The thing that stuck out in our minds was the staff's unwillingness to step on their own friends' toes.  While we were there, a group of women with a guy were in one room and a group of mostly guys were in the main area.  One of the bartenders (had a Jimmy's shirt on) sat with the group in the main area.  The guy with the ladies got up to sing an R Kelly song.  Somehow or another the guys sitting with the employee got up in the singers face and looked like he was going to hit him.  The singer kept singing and did a really good job of restraining himself.  Not once did any employee do anything to stop the harassment.  The group with the singer left shortly after that.  Then the guy started picking on another singer!  Unbelievable.  I have frequented many karaoke establishments in my lifetime and even hosted for a few years.  I have never had to deal with such blatant favoritism before.  If, as a host, I ever needed help with a patron, the staff always helped out without even being questioned."}
{"text":"We live about a block from here, but for whatever reason I had avoided stopping for the longest time.  Not because of the location as much, but because I hate the Chicago Bears.  So, when I saw a Groupon pop up, I figured I'd give them a shot since they were so close.  On the night we went, they were fairly busy - our waitress was overwhelmed, so my poor rating has little to do with the service.    I ordered the special, which was the tortellini trio - based on the waitress' recommendation.  It took longer than normal, and once the meals finally made their way to the table, it was one of the worst presentations I've seen.  I'm certain I could've cooked better pasta at home, and the \"trio\" of sauces that came on the pasta were bland and un-inspiring to say the least.  So, we waited longer than normal, for food that was sub-par, and when it was time to check out, the process took about twenty minutes due to the Groupon.  Groupon is in my opinion great marketing, because it gets people who otherwise would have never stopped (like me) the chance to try out your service.  Combine all of this with the watered down \"cocktails\" that my wife ordered, with the annoying Chicago ambiance, and here we are.  Don't bother stopping unless you're from the windy city and need hometown validation."}
{"text":"I've had this place on my radar for a long time, not many place to get Chicken Vesuvio here in Phoenix.  I stopped in a few weeks for an early dinner and had high expectations.  The decor is a bit outdated, the front room is mainly a bar, but we were seated at a table in the back room with dark furniture, the plastic red/white check tablecloths.  Nothing fancy here at all.  They run a happy hour daily from 3-7 so we started our meal with 1/2lb of mussels in a spicy white wine sauce for $5.  They are were sooooo good!!  I'd have liked the wine sauce spicier, but it was quite tasty.  I had read another review complaining about the lack of bread, but all we had to do was ask and they brought a small loaf of warmed bread to soak up the sauce. Our waitress even offered more bread when we finished the first.  Ordered the Chicken Vesuvio for our entrees and I'm sad to say I was a little disappointed.  I prefer this dish served with chicken on the bone, just has more flavor, but this was served with 2 small'ish chick breasts that seemed more of the \"food service\" kind than fresh chicken.  The vesuvio sauce was really good and garlicy, although after eating the mussels, it just wasn't the stand out I was hoping for.  We finished with a cannoli, and our waitress was upfront that it wasn't homemade, but thought we'd try it anyway.  It was too sweet and sugary and not what a real cannoli should be like.  I was warned, and next time I'll listen!  I'm definitely coming back for mussels and want to try their linguine with clams in the spicy white sauce."}
{"text":"So my friends LOVE this place, but I was pretty much less than impressed with it.  I know it's recently opened, the original is in Chicago.   We sat at the bar and I guess it was the bartender's first day (she made a comment about it), and I kinda felt like people were riding her pretty hard, which I didn't understand cause she seemed to be a pretty competent bartender.  The non-wine happy hour prices are good.  The wine is $5 a glass for the happy hour price (down from their $7-8 glass), which would be ok if the wine were better, but it was just ok.  I have to say they do give you a really generous pour, I received a full wine glass full of prosecco for my $5.    The food is where they lost me.  I ordered the Jimmy's style bruschetta - it was a pile of tomatoes, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts and mozzarella DROWNED in olive oil, surrounded by bread that wasn't toasted and also coated in olive oil.  The whole thing was way to oily, it would have been better if the bread was toasted, it would have been less squishy.     I also ordered the small antipasto salad.  I was amazed by this salad, it was a mountain with at least a thousand calories of mozzarella and salami... I am usually a HUGE fan of both, but there literally was so much I scooped up a bunch of it and donated it to J's salad before just putting the superfluous stuff on an extra plate.  The other problem was the fact that this salad was SWIMMING in red wine vinegar and olive oil.  It was way too much, it took 4 napkins to soak up the excess dressing.  The pizza tasted like a generic deep dish from any major chain.  I'm sure this place will pull itself together.  It's a cute place, and the owners seem pretty nice, but there are a few kinks that need to be straightened out... my advice - ask for less olive oil."}
{"text":"Jimmy's is right down the street from us & I love it! So far, the food is fantastic as well as the service. It can get a bit toasty inside the restaurant but you quickly forget about it when you begin eating!"}
{"text":"I was a long time customer of jimmy's in the old location. just before the move I brought a group of 10 for dinner. I had said to guest how good food was. Well not that night! everything was horrible I was embarrassed that I invited friends. The server was great the food came i reasonable time but nothing tasted good. for  First time the red sauce tasted like a canned with no seasoning.  after asking what everyone thought of food no one liked it.  I don't know what the problem was that night. I wondered if the owners had sold the place, had a new chef or what.."}
{"text":"I LOVE their sausage, peppers, and potatoes.  I've never had peppers that tasted so, so good.   The pizza is pretty good too.  It's a lot better then all of the cheap chain pizza places."}
{"text":"I really liked the place. Went and got half-priced pizza on a Wednesday. The waiter was on top of the drinks and they had a magician doing some dope magic tricks. The pizza was great in my mind and even better for the price I paid. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Went three times. Wanted to like it but just couldn't. Pizza was bland. Pasta sauce was tasteless. Chicken Vesuvio sauce was way too oily, chicken was a little overcooked, and I just couldn't bring myself to like that it was served with smashed potatoes."}
{"text":"We ordered food to go, thinking this was going to be an amazing experience.  I was so wrong.  The parking lot is always busy which lead me to believe this was going to be a gem of Gilbert.  Placing our to-go food was not difficult-everyone was pleasant and nice.  When it came time to pick up our food- we were waiting forever.  I understand that the patrons in restaurant were waiting as long as we were, but I was never offered something to drink while we were waiting.  If you order to-go and it is not ready you are forced to stand in a major traffic area that the staff uses.  I was constantly having to move to allow someone to walk by.  When we finally received our food and were headed home to enjoy the feast that smelled wonderful...I was let down.  Our food had no flavor.  From the salad--no flavor, to the pasta which seemed to taste out of a bottle.  I was not impressed, at all.  I ordered pizza for the kids and they thought it was like peter piper's.  Which I personally think is gross.  I will not return here as the food was nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and was shorted clams on the Clams Oreganado.  Called back and asked for a credit and was told no, only restaurant certificate would be given.  So that tells me that once they have your cash, despite an issue, too bad.  Use to go all the time when they were on Gilbert Rd. but won't be going back here.  Food was cold anyway.  Won't be going back so what makes the owner think I would accept a gift certificate????????? RIDICULOUS - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.    the food was sub par as compared to the past. based on previous reviews I would hesitate to return and explained this. while I realize this is a personal choice, when I called back the first person I spoke with said they could credit us for the missed order. But the owner made his decision which I felt was not fair customer service."}
{"text":"I was super hyped up since the word Chicago apprears and I am a northwest suburban native.  Don;t expect much if you are from Chi-Town.  Soup tased no better than Campbell's I got the gorgonzola Aldredo pasta.  I would never again.  Tasted like Bertolli alfredo and they added gorgonzola.  I am a Chicago Irishman and I can make better Alfredo sauce.  For $15, i feel jipped.  I went with my wife who loves pasta dn not as critical about pasta and she said hers was very lackluster, baked mostoccoli that i could have made at home.  Again $14, yikes.  The folks at the bar seemed to be having a great time and they had kareoke, maybe I just need to try it again and drink a ton and the taste won't matter much?"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Posted hours for Friday's is 11:00 AM - 11:00 PM.  Imagine my surprise and befuddlement when we walked in at 10:07 and were promptly told \"We're Closed\" by the manager, who happened to be counting the cash drawers at the bar. I can understand when you're slow, you're slow. Closing the kitchen is one thing, but closing the entire establishment an hour early is a little ridiculous.  People have been talking about how things have been going \"downhill\" since the move and now I can understand why they feel that way.  It even makes it hard for regulars, which I consider myself, to bring \"first-timers\" into the establishment when we're told to go away because \"we've been slow\".  I'll still continue to come in, but I'm going to find it real tough to recommend this place to friends if they can't get served during \" posted business hours\"."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff is soooo nice! Really cool for fun family nights out. They also have a night life because of their bar - They have karaoke nights (sat. 9pm-12am) and tequila tasting nights, really fun! My favorite dish there is their HOMEMADE Cavatelli with Vodka Sauce - to die for! The first time I tried it, they were catering at an event I was at, now I order it all the time! YUM!"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: If you live in mesa, gilbert, or AJ and expect to just walk in to any place with good food from nov- march on sat night....... Think again! We are infested with snowbirds! There will be a wait.  Anyhoo... Jimmy's was packed on sat night and we waited 15 min for a booth. The place is set up like a pub/ local bar/,pizza joint/ sports bar. Very inviting with a tv in view for play off football peeping. The prices seemed more than reasonable and cheaper than most italian places.  I had the chicago style hotdogs and my girlfriend had the lasagna. Both were tastey as was the table bread / butter / oil. Service was good and the staff had their hands full with at least two 10 person parties.  They do happy hour and have daily food specials. I will return !"}
{"text":"I dined here for dinner with friends, and did enjoy it.  Nothing super-fancy, but the service was good, and the food was decent (always a plus in my book).  I had a salad, which was fresh, and a personal pizza, which was crisp & tasty.  I thought the prices were a bit on the high end given the type of place this is, but the service & fresh food made up for it..  Tasted the chicken parmigiana, which was good, but  not fantastic - I would venture to guess that most of the menu is about like that - You are probably pretty \"safe' in ordering just about everything.....  It is a busy place with moderate noise level & kids - Not a place for that \"romantic\" date you've been planning for ages.....  3/5 stars - Will go back & try again someday."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good. Chicken Parmesan  sub is totally satisfying. The vodka sauce is more like a tomato alfredo, but seriously tasty. They do a fantastic stuffed artichoke. They also deliver!  The pasta portion is rather small, but overall a really solid Italian eatery in the East Valley"}
{"text":"Anywhere with a Chicago theme... I'm in. So, when we were organizing a double-date night, our foursome (all from Chicago) decided that this was a great place to visit. We were quickly and pleasantly greeted at the door and shown to a very long booth. We ordered some fried mushrooms as an appetizer (not my thing, but everyone said they were delicious). Then, for my main dish, I ordered a meatball sandwich- one word can describe it... HUGE. Needless to say, I had some tasty leftovers to take to work the next day.   Overall, the food was good and the atmosphere was nice. It was a quiet evening, and it seemed like the servers were all very attentive to each of the tables.   No complaints and I'd definitely like to go back."}
{"text":"2 hotdogs and 2 beefs. 45 minutes and still waiting. Excuse is that they had 3 other to go orders at the same time I ordered. So plan a head. Unreal. Cant grade the food because I haven't received it yet."}
{"text":"Stopped by for take out last night.bar was busy restaurant was mostly empty.  Waited for help at reception desk and was pointed to take out counter place order.  Very busy corner to place order with no area near it to wait.  10.95 for a undersized salad with  mostly cheese two plum tomatoes light on the meat!  Second time this place and last."}
{"text":"sigh. lets start by updating your beer menu. Its december- surely you've had enough time to take the summer beers off- since you dont have them when people order... We spent a good amount of money last night on mediocre food- mostly off the happy hour menu. The wings were cooked well- which was nice, but BARELY and i mean BARELY any sauce?!? whats up with that? The small cheese pizza was on a prefab pita like crust?! Did i miss something? I thought this was an italian restaurant- you dont make your crust? Dont try to tell me they do, that sucker was perfectly round, had no edges and had the little pucker marks like flatbread does. And who cuts a round pizza into squares?!? It all tasted bought- nothing homemade. Even the oil and vinegar was lacking- no flavor. Oh, and no kids menu, but your waitress can sort of list a few things you can make for kids?? Super disappointed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try this place out as I am a huge Bears fan and my husband is from Chicago and loves all the teams. We visited last night for the Blackhawks game.   We made reservations because we were told the place is packed for games. Omg I had such a great time! For as busy as it was we had excellent service. The owners sister, I didn't get her name, checked on us regularly to make sure we were ok. Our waiter Nick made sure we always had a drink. The shots of fireball for each score and the great atmosphere were a total bonus. I can't wait to watch a Bears game here!  Now the food. It was really good. I had a Chicago dog and fries. My husband had the gluten free pizza and he loved it. I tried it and it was the best gluten free crust I've had. Our friends got a regular pizza and it was really crispy like I like.   If you are looking for a place for a nice quiet meal then do not come on game days. And if you do come on game days do not complain about the service. I think they did a great job for as crazy as it was in there."}
{"text":"One star only because I liked our server! Food was fair! Not going to just spend a lot of words. Not bad food I'll say again but the time it took was way to long 40 - 45 mins. Bad thing was the owner was in the house and was wrapped up in what appeared to be family and friends. Did I mention we were pretty much the only table in there most of the time we were waiting for our pizza, other than as I mentioned the owner and family and friends. It's been more than a year plus since I had visited because of similar slow service."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good.  The rest of the food is solid.  Several good beers on tap.  The place is consistently understaffed though.  I've been a few times during Blackhawk games and they are always in need of about 3 more servers/busers.  The disorganization is stressful to the customers."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a very generous one star. Service is sub par at best. Layout is horrible. The food was not even close to representative of Chicago. They would be better off calling it Jimmy's of Somalia.  I needed a tetnis shot after going to the bathroom, it was gross.  The entire place just feels dirty. The baked clams tasted like they were made a week ago, no way they were fresh.  My wife order baked ziti and the sauce was something a kindergartener could have made better.  I had the Italian beef sandwich which the waitress said was the most popular menu item. I could understand that if most of the clientele was actually starving and hadn't eaten in months. I will never be back here."}
{"text":"It's with a heavy heart that I must admit, I may never come back to visit this establishment. I have come to know this bar as one of my favorite places to watch Chicago Games. But let's fast forward to what will no longer be taking me here....  I won't lie I have talked about this week for so long...Cubs are in the playoffs! I couldn't have been more excited to come to Jimmys. I knew from my last encounter, earlier this year, they don't take reservations so I show up on game day 90 minutes before T-time. And low and behold, guess what, they NOW do take reservations and are booked almost solid. Ok cool, they are on the up and up. However, I explained to the waitress that this establishments reservation policy is very flip floppy, she agreed with me and explained that she's worked here for years and it has gone back and forth several times. Seeing how packed Friday was for Game 1, the table next to me asked to have a reservation for Saturday, the waitress put his name and the list. Not more than 10 minutes later one of the shift managers (I presume, as the owners were not in attendance) came over and let the guy know that they will not be taking reservations for tomorrow....SAY WHAT?! (Needless to say they shared they will be going to Buddyz for Game 2).   I couldn't believe my ears. I explained to the waitress what just happened and she was as baffled as I was.   Game time-lets just say the game started at 6pm and at 615 we still didn't have the game on in the side room with the exception of a small TV in the corner. Several of us had to ask if we could get sound in the room and the game on. The sound was turned on shortly after, but the TVs took until 650pm to get fully set up!!! Very disappointing.   Knowing what we went through the waitress shared she will make an exception and put a reservation for us if we come back Saturday. I thought, sure, I would like them to redeem themselves as sometimes you are going to have an off evening.   Saturday rolls around, I called 90 minutes before T-time to confirm my reservation. The lady who answered my call confirmed it, party of 4 in the bar. Perfect....or so we thought....we get there and they explain that they don't take reservations, I shared I just talked to someone 45 minutes ago to confirm and they let me know that person must have already left. They said they can accommodate me at a table near the front of the bar. I explained that I need a table for 4 (as I have 6 coming) and that table comfortably sits 2 and awkwardly sits 3. They explained they have a bachelorette party coming so the bar is full.....seriously I'm so disappointed. Thankfully one patron offered to move to the table for 2. However, please note the bachelorette party that so badly had to be in the bar with 14 seats didn't show up until the 8th inning and even then only used about 6 seats!   To Jimmy's management, please please please put in clear expectations for reservations to provide a positive and smooth experience for your patrons. I want to see you succeed so badly, but until this establishment can hit above 3.5 stars or higher on Yelp I won't be going back.   As a manger myself I would recommend putting this into place: -Game nights: At least half the party must arrive at least 30 minutes prior, or seating is not guaranteed."}
{"text":"Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 2:  07/13/11  Was \"in the neighborhood\" (Tempe) and thought today would be the perfect day to try an east valley participating restaurant I probably would never even contemplate driving to from all the way in north Scottsdale.  Looking over my list of possibles (whose menus intrigued me online... OK, let's face it-- whose menus offered me a few items I could ACTUALLY eat, due to my food allergies), and I chose Jimmy's of Chicago.  I was sure I'd come face-to-face w/ a dive-y sports bar, but the food photos I'd seen on their Yelp profile begged to differ, so I decided to surprise myself.  And what a pleasant surprise it was!  (To those using Navigation app to locate this place, ignore directions saying to turn right on Pecos traveling on Gilbert Rd. off of the 202E and just continue on, making the first right into the complex past Pecos.)  I arrived just in the nick of time, as a couple was just walking out and the elderly man held the door open for me.  Please note that this is one heavy door!  Upon entry, I indeed was met w/ a noisy and dive-y sports bar, but I'd asked to be seated somewhere less noisy and was directed to a room that was reminiscent of a living room filled w/ dark furnishings-- I think there may even be a fireplace in there, but I could be wrong.  This room won't disappoint those who arrive w/ their families, who don't want to, or can't sit by the bar, and yet want to catch some sports action, as I counted 5 (that's FIVE) mounted flat-screens!    On to the food!  I arrived just before 6p, so I was able to take advantage of their happy hour special of $5 a glass of house wine- my choice was the chardonnay.  I decided to go w/ the Frazalle-cheta to start, the homemade ricotta cavatelli w/ vodka sauce for my main course, and the (only homemade dessert choice on the menu) tiramisu to finish.  A serving of warmed bread and butter arrived even before the wine appeared- nice!  It wasn't long before the app arrived, and was it a pretty sight to behold!  A ring of toasted old-style bread, brushed w/ butter and garlic, surrounding a nice presentation of pepperoni, fontinella, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, and halved grape tomatoes w/ homemade vinaigrette.  The bread felt a bit stale to me, so I mentioned it to the server, who said that the dish is made from an old peasant recipe that calls for day-old bread that is softened and is something they tried to recreate here.  So, I tried to ignore the staleness.  Otherwise, the rest of the dish was very good!  (I was only able to get a photo of the app, as my battery was too low to take pics of the entree and dessert, which actually turned out for the best, as the entree wasn't much to look at...)  A few pieces of bread and bruschetta toppings, and I was ready for the pasta.  The entree included my choice of soup (minestrone, escarole and beans, fagioli) or salad, and I went w/ the salad, choosing the homemade strawberry vinaigrette.  If you like strawberries, then you will love this vinaigrette-- it tasted as if I was eating sweet pureed strawberries!  The veggies were fresh and crisp.  It's a good thing I wasn't planning on eating much of it, bec. the bowl wasn't even on the table for two minutes, when my cavatelli appeared- no exaggeration!  As I've mentioned before, the cavatelli wasn't much to look at.  The pasta looked very white and pasty, while the vodka sauce was thick and had a terra cotta matte-d hue going on.  I like ricotta, so I found it palatable, but very bland, so I quickly put the table-side parmesan and red pepper flakes to good use.  A few forkfuls of this and I was ready for something sweet!  The portion of four-layered homemade tiramisu offered here originally for $5.99 is very small (around 3.5\" x 2.5\" x 2.5\"), so it's a good thing I paid only $3 for it.  It's very good, even w/o the Hershey's chocolate sauce drizzled on top (I had it on the side).  Loved the strength of the liquors used, as well as the textures of the sweetened ricotta and espresso-drenched chocolate lady-fingers.  Mmm...  I'd like to have another, please!    I may be talked into visiting Jimmy's again before Yelp Eats week is over...  Another table's braciole w/ mostaccioli (flank steak, tomato sauce, and penne) looked good, despite the dollop of tomato sauce.  (Again, what's w/ the sauces' presentation here?  This seriously has to be addressed!)  If nothing else, I'd like to try the stuffed artichoke app and have a go at the Coocizza (you guessed it- your choice of chocolate chip, Reese's peanut, or white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie w/ ice cream on top).  I also spotted a breakfast menu!  Now, if only I'd get a chance to make it to this area early enough..."}
{"text":"Jimmy's has a great atmosphere, a great bar good food and fantastic owners!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. For the 1st time since we've been coming here, we tried the pizza tonight.  Let me just say, if Quonset Hut, Potesta's, Louie's or even Tenuta's mean anything to you, you'll love the thin crust pizza at Jimmy's.  This is the thin crust I've been missing."}
{"text":"Small place with good food. The lasagna and bread were excellent! Would recommend and come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Average place.  Food is good, not great.  Service is good, not great...you might get the wrong drink. Overall, good place for food and to hang out."}
{"text":"Nope. Nah. Nu-uh. Not happenin', cuz.  I moved to Arizona from Chicago. I'm a die-hard Gino's East fan, and quite simply there's nothing else to compare. Granted- I have other pies that I've come to love in my day, and those are magnificent for what they are. But for Jimmy's to advertise themeselves as 'Jimmy's of Chicago'... for me, being who I am, I feel like that's disingenuous and predatory.  Try a few pies in Chicago and you'll quickly learn what Chicago pizza is all about. Now, I just placed a phone order with Jimmy's, and I set myself up for (what I was hoping would be) a tasty pie. It was delivered, credit card slip was signed, and that was that.  Then I open the box.  ... WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS LIMP PIECE OF CLOWN-ASS DOUGH-PLATE?!!?!?  You make a pie like this in the 'K' streets, you come down to the Southside, and that's when bad things happen to good people. I also ordered some clams- and these people have the nerve... THE FUCKING NERVE... to stuff clamshells full of breading, stuffing, and (God I hope) minced clam meat, then put it on the menu.  You know what...? Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I missed some sort of fine print. Maybe I didn't read the disclaimer. Maybe I should have read a little deeper. But go fuckyaselves- tonight, I wanted a good deep dish Chicago pie, and was willing to try something new (clams with pizza??!?! sounds good!!!). This order bit me in the ass and I'm willing to live with that. And maybe I'll try them out again and they'll blow me out of the water- I'm willing to hope so. But for now- TWO STARS. Not what I was hoping for, and not good enough to save themselves from my raging hunger-wrath."}
{"text":"Tonight was my daughter's promotion ceremony from 6th grade and following family tradition I let her pick the restaurant and this was her choice.  She had eaten here before but this was the first time for me.  We had an excellent experience!  The food and service were both excellent.  I started with the antipasto, which was really good with lots of pepperoni, salami, and cheese.  We also ordered fried mozzarella sticks, you know, for the kids; the sticks were really plump and crispy and there were seven or eight on the plate.  For the main course I had Ricotta Cavatelli with Vodka Sauce and added a chicken breast.  This was really good and the portion was so generous I only ate half.   For desert we shared the chocolate lava cake with ice cream, which was also really good.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive and did a great job.  Atmosphere is casual, which is okay with me.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tonight, my dad was craving a meatball sandwich. Instead of just going up to Subway on the corner... we decided to be adventurous and try some place new. Jimmy's came up on a Google search of \"Mesa AZ meatball sandwich\", and after looking over their menu online we decided to make the trek down there.  SO glad we did. I ordered a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich. Super yummy. Also super messy and moderately difficult to eat (the way a sandwich should be!). Dad ordered the Homemade Meatball sandwich with the \"spicy\" sauce. I stole a nibble of one of the meatballs... REALLY tasty, but I didn't find their spicy sauce to be terribly spicy (not that I mind, since I'm not good with anything that's too spicy).   On the way out, we ordered the Baked Mostaccioli for my mom at home... I didn't steal a taste, but it looked and smelled delicious.  I look forward to coming back to Jimmy's... I hope their pizza and pasta is just as tasty as the sandwich I had. :)"}
{"text":"Wife and I ordered takeout this evening.  Got Italian beef sandwiches.  Sandwich had lots of beef, onion and green pepper.  Bun was not toasted and there was no indication any 'jus' had made it to the bun.  Not surprising as beef tasted and appeared like it had never been near any 'jus'.   Extremely disappointed.  Not sure how or why they thought they could call it an Italian beef sandwich.  Should just call it what it is.  Beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  The pizza we has was excellent, but unfortunately the owners decided to put on a floor show by dissing a customer over a discrepancy in the bill.  From our perspective, the server had made an error, and the owners tried to intimidate the customer into paying an erroneous bill, calling the customer a \"cheapskate\" and \"never come back here again!\"  The customer struck us as trying to be reasonable and get his bill corrected. Service was a tad slow... not awful, but slow.  All considered, I don't think I want to spend money here to support owners who think so poorly of their customers!"}
{"text":"Glad we found Jimmy's and \"Chicago food\". I love the Chicken Vesuvio. You CAN get it on the bone--just ask--but it takes longer! I can't wait so the boneless breasts are what I usually order. The vesuvio potatoes and the sauce are great and the chicken breasts are moist and flavorful. Add a side or caesar salad--you won't be sorry--cold and crisp. Their bread is good and essential for \"sopping\" the extra vesuvio sauce. Good happy hour deals too. Service was very good considering the staff is young--we weren't sure how it would be but it's been great on every visit. They all pitch in and get the job done and are cheerful and friendly but not intrusive. The only flaw--Jimmy's isn't in East Mesa! I detest high top tables and sure hope they keep the regular height tables in the dining room. Iced tea is always too weak so we don't order it.  UPDATE ON NEW LOCATION: Tried the new location twice. Too loud. It's a bar that serves food rather than a restaurant with a bar. Poor service on both visits. All the great servers from the old location either went elsewhere or maybe were not on duty when we were at the new location. The servers stand around the door to the kitchen talking to each other rather than giving good service. I emailed the owner but got no answer. The whole feeling is \"Jimmy's doesn't give a damn.\" Not sure why they stay in business. There are fewer tables and all are uncomfortable locations so you feel in the way of servers. Salt shakers and other condiment containers are gummy and sticky--how long does it take to wipe them down when bussing a table?"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Italian restaurant, ever. REAL homemade Italian goodness. It's always crowded so bring your patience. And try the gnocchi!"}
{"text":"Is Jimmy single?  Cause if he is, I'd like to introduce myself.  Nice local Italian spot.    Decent prices.  Friendly service.   Antipasta salad was great, lots of goodies for the money.  Meatballs and Italian sausage were okay bu the spicy sauce was great.  I will be back to try the pizza, get another salad and ask if Jimmy is around."}
{"text":"Disappointed  Calamari overdone and tasteless Sauce on all of our entrees could have been used as plaster. Looks like their biggest claim to fame were their large selection of beer.  There isn't enough beer in the entire county to make this meal palatable"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The service is amazing and food is delicious.   I especially enjoyed the Clams Oreganato appetizer.    The Eggplant Parm lunch special came with pasta and choice of soup or salad.  What a great deal!"}
{"text":"I visited here on 4/11/16 around 5:45 and it wasn't overly busy.  The sign said to seat yourself. It was nice so I sat on the patio where 3 other tables were occupied.  I wasn't greeted or acknowledged for 10 minutes so I got and said something to a waitress.  Her answer was, \"We didn't see you\", yet I was in direct view of the inside.  Maybe they should think about changing the Seat Yourself sign.  Each table should be greeted within 1 minute of being seated.  Not sure how the food is, but that service was unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"Last night we went to this ADORABLE little place to celebrate a belated birthday for one of my closest friends.  It was a rare occasion for my husband and I to have an adult night out while our son was at grandma's house.    We got there around 9:00 PM...hungry for dinner but waiting for our perpetually late friends.   We had some beer (which was dirt cheap - big glasses of Blue Moon were about $3 or $3.50..and pitchers were cheaper) and a few appetizers and a salad.   The Toasted Jalapeno Ravioli appetizer was very unique and good.   The wings were good...kind of small and not the best I've ever had but flavor decent...salads and other food that I tasted of our friends when they finally got there were good as well.    We stayed until closing....there was Karaoke, fun, TV, dancing on the bar, and did i say fun?     When we left the super cute owner (I didn't ever catch her name but was told she owns the place) hugged us all as we left....she was cute and super friendly!!!   ALL of the servers and bartenders were friendly and fun.  I don't remember her name, but our main server (a cute young blonde) was GREAT...we loved her...especially for putting up with a bunch of drunk old 30-40 something people!  I've never been to Chicago, but this little restaurant/bar reminded me of living back east and those rare cute cozy little restaurant/bars...the type of place I'd LOVE to own if I ever had the guts to go into the business.   Even if the food sucked I'd give it 3-4 stars because the atmosphere and family/fun factor was there.     We will definately visit again for dinner or lunch.....or even a late night with friends again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's very unique and not your typical restaurant in a strip mall. The beef/sausage combo sandwich is amazing! It's huge and you get your $'s worth for sure. My fiance loved the pizza, said it's much better than the expensive, classy pizza's i've made him try in the past! :) Shrimp scampi was yummy, but was overpriced. Love the music and atmosphere. Customer service is the best part and request the waitress Allison! So sweet she was! Good variety of good on the menu.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I have been here on two occasions...sold by the Chicago style the ad (and name) promises.  It's a fine bar with a huge menu, and while I'm not totally craving their food, they do have something for everyone.  They have a large dog variety, and there are tons of appetizers to pick from.  The servers are pleasant, albeit a bit on the slower side, and I never felt as if I wasn't being taken care of.  I'm not clamoring to go back but it was fine.  The guy who does karaoke on Wednesday nights is awe.some."}
{"text":"I know it's early to write an update but I had their food again at an event it it was pretty darn tasty, especially the potatoes with Italian sausage, peppers and onion.  Jimmy of Yelp thanks you for reading my update."}
{"text":"Came in on Friday night around dinner time, but it was surprisingly not busy for a sports bar on a Friday night. In the true sense, this is definitely more of a sports bar than it is an Italian restaurant, but they do have some interesting selections, mostly homemade food, and pretty tasty meals.  The service is catered more towards a group of sports fanatics than it is towards Italian food fanatics. We ordered the half chicken; one with steamed vegetables and one with the regular potato side. We were informed that these would take 25 minutes to prepare. We were completely okay with this, as it usually means the food is a little more fresh.  The salads came first, and they were just ordinary salads, nothing spectacular, but the lettuce and vegetables were fresh and crisp.  Our entrees arrived, and the steamed vegetables were incorrect so we had to wait for them to bring out a new side. Most of the chicken was a little dry, but did have some decent flavor. The half chicken was served in pieces (thigh, leg, breast, etc.) instead of a one-piece half chicken. This might have lent itself to making the chicken a little more dry. The potatoes were nothing special, but the new steamed vegetables that were brought out were cooked perfectly.  To finish up we definitely needed to try the Tiramisu. We wanted to make sure it was made in house as the menu depicted, and our waitress confirmed that it was. A bit later the Tiramisu was served to our table. Now normally my pallet is a little desensitized to the taste of alcohol in food and desserts. I normally am not able to pick out the flavors of the liquor in Tiramisu at other restaurants, but this was an exception. I could definitely sense the flavors of the liquor, so if you are a Tiramisu fanatic and like strong and bold flavors, this would be the one for you. The ladyfingers were light, and the mascarpone cream was fluffy, not too sweet, and fairly airy. Definitely our favorite part of the meal.  If you don't come in expecting five-star food, but instead expect a laid-back environment with above-average Italian food for the type of restaurant, this is the place. The prices are decent, especially during lunch and happy hour, and the Tiramisu is worth getting. Service was a little lackluster, but the restaurant was clean, wi-fi is available, and this is a good place to bring family and friends to hang out."}
{"text":"Ok, planned to go here for the last Bears game and then read all the bad reviews. Thought I'd made a mistake. Wrong! Good service, good beer choices, friendly atmosphere, good bar food. They gave out raffle tickets for each purchase, generously I would add, and then pulled tickets and had gifts at the end of each quarter. Nice! So I'm not rating this place as a restaurant, but more as a bar & grill as that's all I wanted and the only food I was looking for. So consider my rating as relative to that and expectations of same."}
{"text":"Not happy with Jimmy's tonight.  Came in to make a toast to St. Patrick and they are out of corned beef and cabbage.  Plan ahead please.  Already have to beg my husband to visit Jimmy's because of high prices and spotty service.  Tonight may have been the nail in the coffin.  Not very busy and it's St. Patrick's .....please make sure you have plenty of the special you advertise.  Huge bummer when I'm trying to make this our regular neighborhood place and we bring our friend and family. Unfortunately, I also need to add that Jimmy's charged us a higher price for our canned Guinness than what was advertised on Facebook.  Not the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"Love Jimmy's. Italian beef sandwich is just like what you get in Chicago. Nice bar, too."}
{"text":"They were playing songs from the 70s, like: my woman from tokyo.  I hadn't heard that one in ages.  Took me back to pizza joints from my youth.  Got the stuffed artichoke app, but they didn't take the thistle out.  You know, that makes for an interesting mouthful of hair like spines.  The homemade cavetelli (similar to gnocci) was a hearty pasta choice.  It is thick like a dumpling, so be prepared (if you're not familiar with that pasta type).  The vodka sauce was flavorful.  After a few bites, it was obvious that the braciole with mostaccioli was a good choice.  However, after several more bites, it became evident that the braciole was overcooked.  The sausage with peppers and potatoes was filling.  The sausage was a bit overcooked, and the peppers and potatoes needed more seasoning.  We topped it off with a piece of their homemade tiramisu, which tasted excellent, but would have been better with more ladyfinger (and a homemade chocolate sauce, as opposed to Hershey's syrup)."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Owner could have cared less to even say hello or goodbye.  Italian Beef was far from anything I ever had in Chicago. If you want good Italian beef look to Lukes or even the frozen stuff at Costco. It's better trust me."}
{"text":"Tried this place a while back and thought it was so so. Decided to try again and still think it is so so. The Alfredo sauce was bland and to add chicken to the pasta was going to be an additional 4.99 to an almost $11 dollar pasta, really!!!! I can buy a whole chicken for a little more than that. The wait staff we had was very nice. Not a fan of the one girl wait staff wearing short shorts and bending over the tables with their behind showing nor was I a fan of having the bar patrons using the F bomb watching sports on the TV. This is a family restaurant or so they claim and yes there was a child in there and having to listen to that. The Lasagna was also so so and lacked in flavor. I won't be trying it a third time."}
{"text":"This is based on the bar only, no food.  We stopped in here after an event at Chandler-Gilbert Community College.  I had a cider, and everyone else had beers.  It seems like they have a good selection of beers, but I'm not a beer drinker.  Lots of TVs if you are in to watching sports.  I have not tried the food.  Good service, overall nice atmosphere if you are looking for a drink at a sports bar like place."}
{"text":"Great place, great people. Great food and drinks. Alex is a great server and bartender!"}
{"text":"stopped by here on a Thursday around 5ish.  Grabbing a bite for take out and to have a quick beer with a buddy.  Beer was good, thats about it.  Had the chicken Vesuvio,   2 pieces of chicken, one was a bone in half breast piece.  the other was a flattened breast piece.  looked like they ran out of vesuvio and let me have a marsala piece for replacement.  horrible.."}
{"text":"I was there last night and had a good beef/sausage combo. Great staff, very welcoming. And they had karaoke last night, I joined in on the fun with a few songs. There were quite a few singers in the queue. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner, staff was kind. PLace was spacious with lots of televisions for sporting events. Menu looked to have a variety. We ordered the Gorgonzola Alfredo with chicken. There was no Gorgonzola flavor to it. Due to the time ( almost closing) and our schedule we just paid for it and left. We also got the stuffed mushrooms which stated they were stuffed with sirloin.... That should state ground sirloin. We were led to believe otherwise. My friend also got a raspberry tea which was a tart green tea, she didn't drink yet we paid for. I called and spoke to a manager the next day who acknowledge there were Kitchen staff changes yet offered no service recovery. Our check was over $50... I am not sure ill be back considering..."}
{"text":"This place is going to be detrimental to my diet. We stopped in last night to check it out and it was fantastic. Service was great and they even have my favorite dish veal parm. There is a golden tee and a pretty good beer selection. The best part is it's a bar.. you can cheer for your team and have a good time without being looked at like your crazy or being asked to leave. We will definitely be frequenting this spot."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday party and the place  was packed.  Service was very good even under convusing circumstances. Lacey was our server and did a great job. The whole staff was good too because i had an empty  glass as another sever walked by and asked if i needed something.    DJ was great.  A good mix of music. Food was geat we did an appy and salad and they were very good...the place is just a good time!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but a bit up and down, sometimes really good, others just SO SO. The home made gnocchi has been great on two occasions and just alright on two others, same with the meat balls. The in house vodka sauce, my favorite, always pleases, now if only the pasta followed. The bar staff is quite friendly if a little slow and the beer selection leaves a little to be desired. No local beer? This place could easily be 4-5 stars if they picked up their game just a little. I like it, but would like to love it."}
{"text":"\"Hidden\" is almost accurate, it's more...unexpected, location wise! But who cares! This is one of my fave Italian places right now. Mainly because of the food! I've been a handful of times so far, the service is not terrific but usually predictably decent and friendly.But the food has been consistently great! I've had the shrimp scampi a couple of times, the Italian sausage with the spicy Vodka sauce-Fuhgeddabawtit!! Amazing! My guy usually sticks with the classics like spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna, but I've tried both. Yum! Wine of course is average supermarket wine but it complements their food well enough. Bread came out cold one time, but hey, I need to eat less of that anyway! Bar seems to be fun and friendly but there are plenty of TVs throughout. It's always busy when I have gone but you don't have to wait an HOUR like at Oreganos up the street and I promise the food is just as good or better!"}
{"text":"Great  food and price , We had calamari for appetizer ,then I had linguini a la jimmy( delicious ) and my wife had the lasagna and she ate it all, and that says a lot ."}
{"text":"Had a couple of beers, salad and pizza.  Had a Kiltlifter ($5.75) and a San Tan Pineapple whatever ($7.00).  Just a tad pricey.  Had a Caesar salad.  Not bad but could have used more acid in the dressing.  The croutons appeared to be homemade but were mostly burnt.  Probably didn't need to serve them.  Pizza was good.  I like thin crust and this was a bout as good as I've had.  Not quite a 4, closer to a 3.5."}
{"text":"Service is the absolute best! Staff so friendly and attentive! Food was equally amazing!  Comfortable atmosphere! Will definitely be back with friends and family!"}
