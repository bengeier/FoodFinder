{"text":"Have been at this place at least 10 times already. Unfortunately my friends don't know better. They keep coming back to this place because of life music, Russian food and ambiance. Yeah you've read right Italian place that serves Russian food. Well I am certain that the cook speaks Russian and for many times that I've been at that place haven't seen anything Italian. Regarding food, well that's why I give low rating. I'll say only that my mother on a bad day makes better food. Should be enough. So if you wanna come to meet some Russian chicks or just meet Russian people, have some vodka and listen or dance to Russian music go there on Friday or Saturday nights. Oh and it's expensive considering the food you get."}
{"text":"Trattoria Cinecita is fabulous! When I say the word \"delicious\" I am not referring exclusively to the food, but rather inclusively to the the way the Manager George Benchimol textured the entire meal with genuine warmth and expert service! As a foodie I would recommend this restaurant to all, but the dining experience was made truly extraordinary by the leadership. Bravo! A real find!"}

{"text":"I FEEL RIPPED OFF CHEATED STOLEN, lied to worse new years ever!!!!!! WASTE OF MONEY! Dont trust them and their management. They are money hungry individuals. Dont waste your time or your hard earned money. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! AVOID AVOID AVOID AT ALL COST! Shame on them for doing what they have done! They charged 155$/pers for their new years party and they ended up seating us at a seperate room which was cold clusterphobic and disgustingly dirty there was no body to come and serve us we felt humiliated and we left right away. If we had of known this was our small table in a small basement with no heating we would have never even bothered. I cant even believe im giving this shit a 1 star. I cant even believe or even start to describe what had just happened to us. I frel like I'm back in USSR and treated like a peasant in a third world country AVOIDDDDDD I REPEAT AVOID!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time. Loved the food, loved the place as did all the people who packed the place."}
