{"text":"So glad this place is still around. The service has always been friendly and fast and the food fresh and delicious. Hands down the best Corned Beef and Chefs salad around."}
{"text":"The Richmond Restaurant is a great no-frills kind of place. They have awesome corned beef, and a fantastic bean soup (its not on the regular menu, just a special). In addition to the good food (big portions - you won't leave hungry) they also have great service. I've been to this place many times, and have never been disappointed. I highly recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Richmond Restaurant has officially closed its doors for good.  There is a note on the door thanking all their customers and employees.  They were in business for over 50 years.  Gonna miss their Ruben sandwiches the most.  Many good times there.  Best of luck to Bill and his parents and God bless.. thanks for all the great food through the years!  Gonna miss you guys!
