{"text":"Took mom here for a quick lunch.  The service was excellent, staff was friendly and quick. Mom had the burger, cooked medium; the burger had a perfect char on the outside and was medium inside. .. It was delicious!  I had the Italian sandwich with fig spread.  Didn't care for the spread, and the sandwich was a little chewy, but the flavor was on par.  This place has some real potential.  

Great location next to the Container Park with street parking as well as lot parking just a block away."}
{"text":"Great meal. Second time here. This time for an early dinner. Had poutine with mushrooms. Very tasty. Felt like an upper class Canadian. Then we had the Japanese sweet corn which was yummy. The pork cheek gnocchi was perfect and awesome. The lamb crepinettes had good flavor these were ground lamb, not pieces of lamb. 

The cocktails here are thoughtful and well crafted. Liked the deer in the headlights. Coulda had two or three of those, easily. Too bad it was a school night....

Will definitely come back again. 

Jade was our waitress.  She was friendly, helpful and overall great!"}
{"text":"Friendly waiter who was very enthusiastic describing the food. Had the burger which was tasty.  Everything tasted fresh."}
{"text":"So I rushed Downtown after work to eat at Glutton on a recommendation from a co-worker for my birthday. We got there at 9:30 pm and they close at 10 PM. As soon as we walked in the door, one of the employees said they were closed. My date said that we thought they did not close until 10 PM. His response that the hours can change on business needs and recommended we go to  Carson's Kitchen down the road because they are open later. I told him it was my birthday. He said \" Sorry\". So we did. But they were also closing at 10 PM.  However, they accommodated us. We had a wonderful time. Especially since it was my birthday."}
{"text":"We were offered outdoor seating. Didn't know they had it. Nice back patio! Started off with the Ahi tuna tacos. Very good. The taco shells were light and crisp. The filling fresh and tasty. The entrees were decent. I had the Benedict with pork and chipotle hollandaise. Not bad. The side of potatoes was good- crispy with a Cajun kick. The \"Improved Mule\" cocktail was refreshing, citrusy, and effervescent. 

The only knock down was the service. I think it was just our server in particular, because everyone else was pretty attentive and accommodating. The server we had seemed to forget about us a few times. But other than that, I'd give this place another try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for brunch. I never have to deal with a line and the food is top tier. The zuchinni sandwich is to die for. Their banana bread is the moistest I've ever had. I'm hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today. Wild mushroom omelet. OMG - it was so good. My new favorite breakfast. I got the fruit in place of the potatoes, and the melons were actually sweet (yes- they are suppose to be sweet but you seldom find them that way in most restaurants).  The servers ( we had lunch there on Thursday for our first visit to Glutton) on both days are helpful and care about their customers.  A must try for yourself restaurant. Only problem - music is too loud at least for me."}
{"text":"Had breakfast and an incredible Bloody Mary this morning! They do as much locally sourced items as they can and everything is truly homemade. Food was incredible and service was even better! I can't wait to try it for dinner :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were driving by saw this place and decide to give it a try. We ate from the Sunday Brunch menu. 

Starters: we had the Spicy Pork Rinds. The best way I can explain them would be an adult version of Cheetos. Don't let the make fool you cause their not spicy. We loved them! 

Plates: I had the Wood Roasted Chicken Hash and my fiancé had the Benedict. The Chicken Hash was flavorful and moist not dry it came with Texas toast but I didn't care for. The Benedict doesn't come with the traditional muffin they make their own bread and it's spongy and delicious.

Drinks: Glutton Mary & Pappes Peaches. The kimchi in the Glutton Mary gives it a kick it's great for hangovers and it comes with a hudge shrimp. The Pappes Peaches has a smooth peppery Peach taste 

Server: Justen. He was awesome! He's knows the menu, he's friendly, and approachable."}
{"text":"Cool little restaurant off the beaten path.  Ambiance from the decor to the open kitchen was awesome.  The Wild Mushroom Omelette and the featured pancakes were amazing.  Stacey our server was friendly, genuine and on point.  Check this place if you're in town."}
{"text":"How to rave enough about this place? 
Loved the casual atmosphere, served by the most sincerely enthusiastic waiter, delicious and unique food.
We had pork flatbread, Japanese street corn, garganelli, and caramel popcorn profiterols. All was fantastic. Will eat here again-many times!"}
{"text":"Tried this new eatery out with my son on Saturday afternoon.  My son, 15, is an adventurous eater and I thought that the interesting items on the menu would peak his appetite.

He order the Shaved Brussel Sprouts and Roasted Sea Bream while I had the Gem Lettuce with Roasted Shrimp.  Both meals were incredible fresh and prepared beautifully.

Our server was wonderful and even joked around with my son and made a typical teen boy smile.

We will definitely return to Glutton to sample more of the wonderful creations prepared by their chefs."}
{"text":"Family went and thoroughly enjoyed. Eclectic fare so have to be a little  adventurous but don't be afraid to try different things. Well worth it. Loved the calamari. Small but good beer selection. Different mixed drinks. Skirt steak was very good."}
{"text":"This place is so goddamn good. I don't usually even leave reviews because this website is retarded but I'm a little hungover so fuck it."}
{"text":"Every dish I have ever ordered has been executed to perfection.  Flavors I never would have imagined go together, perfectly balanced.   Any place that makes a cocktail with Glenmorangie Lasanta is Aces in my book."}
{"text":"Glutton for brunch. They opened at 9am and we were 1st ones in. We sat at the bar to watch the NFL and had some excellent Bloodies all adorned with shrimp. We ordered the peaches and cream waffles which were simply outstanding. A caramel bourbon sauce that is to die for is poured over the top. The short rib scramble and the huevos rancheros rounded out our order and were both ok. I really wasn't a fan of either but my friends liked, not loved.  I'd like to give food 3.5* and service 5*. The bartender (forgive me for forgetting his name) was great and personable."}
{"text":"had an amazing glenlivet cocktail, yes glenlivet on a cocktail list, its a can not miss. i like my drinks strong and thats exactly what you get with this delicately made drink. shared ahi tuna tacos and eggplant caponata. the tacos were perfectly crispy using won ton skins, avocado creme was delicious, the perfect amount of spice, and tuna was fresh. caponata had whole chunks of eggplant, good spice, and topped off with pine nuts, served with toast points with melted goat cheese, great combination of flavors.

for our entrees my homie nate had a fried shrimp blt that was right on point, with perfectly crispy bread. i had a grilled pork sandwich that was their take on a banh mi. it was right on point, jalapeños weren't spicy, cabbage and carrots were well marinated, and pork perfectly cooked. crispy bread = yes, sandwich delicious = yes

good service by our server but what was surprising was the other server in the restaurant, as nate and i were discussing cocktails he overheard us as he was walking by and highly recommend the drink i was thinking about and he was right on point. i loved it. great service from someone not your server is unexpected, remembered, and special, great job sir.

2 drinks + great banh mi + 2 apps + memorable service = great start of the day...."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this amazing experience upon our arrival in Vegas.  Close to downtown, it's a place that you need to find, if you like great food and incredible service (Eric).  Owned by an independent chef, and run like a place that wants your return visit (come to Columbus, Chef?).

Our table had two Burgers, one done up Gluten Free, and a Crispy Chicken.  Along with the fries and a side salad, all outstanding selections!  

Thanks Chef Manchester!"}
{"text":"So-so... Which is disappointing since I loved my first visit. We came in for brunch and the restaurant was pretty empty. Lots of staff + few patrons = lots of talking and hanging around. Everyone was seated in one little corner on top of each other, so we requested a different table for a little more space. Service was okay. We were sold on the special which was a salted caramel French toast. Really too sweet and the bread was cut in such huge chunks that it didn't cook right - the center core was dry and bready, the rest of it was very eggy and a bit undercooked. Probably would have been better as French toast sticks. The baked tomato and egg dish was lighter and seemed to eat more like a dip. Took us a minute to figure out how to eat it, but it was pretty tasty. The kale was nice with it. Coffee was alright- nothing special. I should have ordered the charcuterie panini - that's particularly delicious. I'll definitely be back for that and the cauliflower starter, but no French toast for me."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service at dinner and Brunch. Stacey and Dean were the best! 7 of us dined and we all loved our food and drinks."}
{"text":"Awesome food great service...my new favorite spot to eat downtown. Try the chicken oysters for an app ...the fish is delicious I had the sea breem"}
{"text":"While visiting the Fremont Area to get a taste of old Vegas, we developed an need to taste actual food.  So, where to go?  Scanning the area, we saw a couple of police officers, and asked for their recommendation.  They both replied, without hesitation: \"Glutton!\" They even suggested a few appetizers - calamari fries, artichoke dip, shaved brussels sprouts.
A quick stroll down Carson Street, and we were there.   The restaurant is clean, and open, and from the moment you walk in, you are immersed in a culinary experience: the scents, the passionate and detailed descriptions of the menu from the staff, and you can even interact with the chefs!  The food was easily the best we had in vegas, and it's all made in-house - my wife had ahi tuna tacos, our friends had their burger and fettucini, and I had the braised flatbread...and we ordered all 3 appetizers.  I'm not a chef, so I can't begin to do their food any justice, but it was simply delicious, and Glutton will be at the top of the list when we return."}
{"text":"Amazing staff amazing food everything was amazing!!! Just ask for Stacey she won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Wandered into this place after waiting awhile at another restaurantfor brunch. It was pretty quiet, I have no idea why, it was so good this place should be packed all the time. The staff were super friendly and the food was excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious, inventive food in a great atmosphere. The zucchini parmesan was one of the best vegetarian sandwiches I've had, ever. Nice beer selection. We will make this a regular stop on our trips to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I have never been to a better staffed restaurant in my life. It was Saturday night but everyone working was engaging and seemed to want to be there!  We sat at the bar and asked many questions about the food and everyone was happily answered.  The pickeled tomatoes with whipped ricotta was recommended to us as a must try dish. I would have never ordered it without the prompting. It was one of the most memorable dishes I've ever had. We also had curried cauliflower, pasta with lamb ragu and scallops with bacon jam. Everything was great and I found the prices and the portions to be reasonable. I can't stop raving about Glutton."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinning experience! The concept is fantastic, food portions are little bigger than tapas style but not to much for one and enough to share. 

Such wonderful explosions of taste in your mouth with every dish. The bread and butter let me tell you, they churn there own butter! Everything except the hamburger buns are made fresh in house. 

The staff was fun, exciting and so delightful! 

Looking forward to watching your growth and what other creations you will bring us. What a wonderful treat for downtown Las Vegas!

Good luck and best wishes to you and your staff.
Danny"}
{"text":"really liked the eggs benedict. affordable. and it was casual. went for brunch. best of all there was no wait - very important imo. 
young crowd. but it would be nice for family meals also."}
{"text":"Very unique food, excellent service and great location. 
Every item on the menu is very special. We had few starters and they were very tasty. The calamari was well seasoned and rich. the japanese corn is the STAR of the menu. 


Ask for Justin, he will take care of u"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The food is on-point and the service (see Mike!!!) is killer. I came two days in a row for the boozy brunch. First day I had the Apple Pie Waffle, which was delicious!!!! The second day I had the Benedict....it just doesn't get any better. If you find yourself downtown, do yourself a favor and walk by Eat (as in DON'T stop) on your way to Glutton!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of Glutton is wonderful! It feels like a kitschy Seattle Pub. The concept of shareable plates is a lot of fun for a big group. I recommend getting a reservation and a bottle of wine. We tried the Glutton Burger, braised beef flatbread and the peach cobbler. 

The burger and flatbread was a little bit of a let-down. I wish It had a richer sauce and smokier flavor. 

However, the peach cobbler with rum raisin caramel sauce was the saving grace! I would go back just for the dessert and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Excellent experience!  So I ordered the hamburger and it was not an ordinary hamburger it was superb! Fresh ground beef and brisket and farm to table veggies! I regret not having their homemade artisan cheese on it. The atmosphere was great with the large windows. Really gives a \"downtown\" experience. Definitely will return--especially for their upcoming brunch!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was very  delicious and the staff was soooo nice!
Had a fantastic meal and great drinks"}
{"text":"Came to Glutton on a whim, didn't have any expectations. We were completely blown away by the fantastic food, attentive and friendly staff, and bartender totally on point. I can't say enough good about this place, just blown away! I highly recommend!! Mike was so awesome!!"}
{"text":"Glutton is amazing!  Start to finish a wonderful experience.  The open kitchen lets you see how fresh everything is & the care that goes into its presentation.  We had the whipped ricotta with pickled tomatoes & the mushroom omelette- both seasoned perfectly and really no room whatsoever for improvement.  Our meal was so good we decided to push ourselves & managed to devour an order of the yeast risen pancakes.  It was worth it- pancakes had excellent flavor & the perfect crisp edge with fluffy centers.  I wish we lived near enough to come every weekend!  Anytime I'm in Vegas I will make a point to drop in & try the rest of the menu- everything looks like it's made with love!"}
{"text":"I'm a server in Vegas. LITERALLY WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD. All rude. Didn't have one of the food orders come out and they didn't even apologize when it was brought to attention. Awesome."}
{"text":"We went to this place last week unplanned because there was an hour-long wait at Carsons kitchen. We ordered four items. The calamari the burger,  short ribs  pasta and the Seabass fish. We loved the Seabass fish and the calamari but pasta was a disappointment it was way too aldente to the point of being raw  and the burger was just whatever. ONE AND DONE. Service was ok though."}
{"text":"The ambiance at Glutton is casual classy. For an app 6 of us shared the pickled tomatoes with ricotta and it was amazing! The brunch menu creative. We all tried something different and everything was fresh and the flavors blended perfectly."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! The corn and stuffed olives are life changing! The service is exceptional, I highly recommend sitting at the kitchen bar."}
{"text":"In a city littered with high end restaurants, I've found the best places are the local joints off the beaten path. This is one of the best I have ever been to for food quality, service and price. The Calamari is out of this world. We also tried the burger and absolutely loved it!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place!! A must try when you are in Downtown Las Vegas... Short walk from The Golden Nugget.. Highly recommend for Brunch!! Everything was tasty!!"}
{"text":"Creative food, unique flavors!  They aim to please. Service and downtown ambience is pleasant."}
{"text":"Super tasty! 5 of us ordered different things; no one was disappointed.  I recommend the Top of the Morning Cocktail if you like whiskey. So good I had 2-good thing I'm not driving, seriously, how can I even type right now?!?!? Don't judge me, it's been a stressful week. Want dessert for breakfast? Order the Apple Pie Waffles. The 16 y.o. faux-nephew says the Huevos Rancheros were delicious. Husband says chilaquiles are amazing. The Short rib scramble was excellent, according to Big Rob. I have a lame onion allergy, so my choices were limited (hence the cocktails), but the breakfast sandwich hit the spot!!!

Give it a try-you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great new dining experience downtown Las Vegas.  Food was AWESOME!  Delicious, beautiful, and flavorful.  Loved the Lamb which was a wonderful combination of flavors.  Chicken was tender and juicy and brussel sprout salad was a great starter.  The Improved Mule is a great new Moscow mule drink. 
We will be back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"couldn't find the secret menu, but what we had was really good with the short rib scramble and benedict. The benedict had much more flavor and was super rich and filling. The beignets could have been a little lighter but it had a good flavor balance with the apricot jam.  Good service and nice ambiance. Will try again for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Not worth the price at all in my opinion. Tried the onion rings and the shrimp after a night out."}
{"text":"We dined for dinner, no reservation and no wait. There were only a few tables occupied on our visit. Cute space. Service was warm and welcoming. Plates are small and intended for sharing. We ordered a few to start and figured we'd delve deeper into the menu as needed. 

They have a pretty good beer selection. I'm always pleased when I find Deschuetes Fresh Squeezed IPA ($7). It was a short wait for our first dish, which was the Brown Butter Gnocchi ($16). It was the most hearty of the three ordered. I didn't expect it first, but we didn't mind digging in. The sum of its parts were good, but it fell a bit flat. Underseasoned and the gnocchi were a bit doughy. 

We were served the Buffalo Sweetbreads ($12) next. These were flavorful and a playful twist, but it left me wishing the sweetbreads were chicken. The hot sauce was a distraction from everything I love about sweetbreads. The delicate sweet creaminess was completely lost. 

The last dish to arrive was the Truffle Gougeres ($8). I was anticipating airy bites with gooey truffle cheese centers. They were gooey, but not so airy and just a hint of truffle was noted. The dough was so bland. It was in desperate need of salt. It was a let down.

Three strikes and we were out of there. I really wanted to like Glutton. On the surface, it seemed like a winner, but when it came down to execution it missed the mark. I was rather bummed, I had hoped for more. Especially at that price point. It's a shame too, because the menu is intriguing. I hear brunch is good; perhaps, that's the better choice?

I can't say it earned three stars, but it is a notch above two."}
{"text":"This is hands down my new favorite place downtown. My husband and I thought we'd try it out, and i am SO glad that we did! Our server Justin was so great and had some amazing recommendations. The food is phenomenal. I had the quail pot pie, and my husband had their burger. We got the fish tacos and he onion dip to start. Everything was perfect! So tasty and fresh! I will be back sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time going to this new restaurant! Surprisingly (for a new restaurant) the staff really knew what to do recommend some dishes that were absolutely worth trying. The pickled tomato and ricotta was an absolute must have!"}
{"text":"Father wanted to come by and check out the place, staff was super friendly and fast with helping us, restaurant was really nice looking overall. Reason why this got 3 stars is due to the plate i ordered, got the breakfast plate. The eggs were a bit too runny and although the potatoes had all this fancy seasoning, didnt taste like much. Might of ordered the wrong thing who knows"}
{"text":"delicious! we stopped by during a visit to Las Vegas, and it was definitely one of best restaurants that we tried."}
{"text":"I was thrilled with my meal here.  I guess I have just had too many dinners out lately that have been just OK.  
My friend and I sat at the bar and really enjoyed the personalized service.  We started with the whipped ricotta, pickled tomatoes and grilled bread.  This was the kind of dish I will probably always have to order every time I go back.  Everything was perfectly balanced and delicious.
We also tried the chicken liver mousse with port wine reduction, hamburger with mushroom poutine and shredded brussels sprout salad.  Then finished with the caramel corn profiterole.  The dessert wasn't terribly exciting, but the other dishes made up for it and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Very good, affordable super tasty food. Some items can be hit and miss, but mostly it's tasty and reasonably prized.

The curry cauliflower and the corn are both great.

Not enough people know of this place, so tell your friends and go hang out."}
{"text":"Tesla Supercharger Users in Downtown Las Vegas - Glutton was the first place we saw when exiting the garage and the best thing we could have found. Casual atmosphere - gourmet food!  Ahi Tuna Tacos, Beet Salad, Short Ribs all superb."}
{"text":".     

 This place is great! Everything on this select menu was ultra tasty. Superb service and friendly staff. Portions were healthy and prices reasonable. We'll be visiting more often :) Be sure to try the calamari fries to get you started and a delicious craft beer too. The fries are plenty to share for a group of four. Emjoy!"}
{"text":"First visit for the wife and I.  We arrived right at opening time, 5 pm Sunday, first customers to enter.  We were greeted immediately and seated at a table of our choice.  Drink order taken immediately upon seating.  We both want with the Tenaya Creek oatmeal stout.

Our waitress, Staci, arrived with our drinks very quickly.  She fully explained the menu to us and took our order.  Items came out quickly except for one item, the brown butter gnocchi with pork cheeks.  The pork cheeks were not ready during our entire stay of about an hour, so unfortunately we did not get a chance to try it.  We did the Pickled spring tomatoes with whipped ricotta, Buffalo sweetbreads, and the mushroom poutine fries.  All items were very good, though the fries were a little too salty.  We opted for two deserts to share, the caramel popcorn profiteroles and a wood fired peach cobbler.  Both were very good, but the peach cobbler won hands down.  

Our waitress also explained all ingredients of every item she served and was very friendly.
 
Servings are somewhat small, tapas style and it is a bit pricey; however we will go back to try other offerings."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place on my favorite radio station and was looking forward to eating there as a result. I was really pleased with Glutton. The server was very friendly and helpful, giving us tips on what to eat, etc. I already knew I was getting the short rib since it's one of my favorite cuts of meat. It was delicious and very tender, just the way I like it. They apparently cook it for a long time. We also had the pork belly salad. That was also very delicious. I usually don't get desert but decided to try the apple cobbler. It wasn't bad. I definitely will be back to try some other things on the menu if I can resist getting the short rib again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere. Stopped in for brunch before heading out of Vegas and we will be back for their burger which sounds amazing! Come here if you want great food without the strip prices and lines. Highly recommended with great friendly service!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and the food was a mixed bag. The service was very friendly.  Cinnamon roll was huge and looked gorgeous but was unfortunately stale, hard and just not fresh enough.  Cinnabon is better I hate to say.  The waffle was amazing though.  I would go back just for the waffle.  Vanilla whipped cream was fresh and you can see it was housemade.  Eggs were very good but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday around 10:30 for brunch. It wasn't very busy & we were able to get seated right away. Service was good from the moment we sat down. Friendly, attentive, & we weren't rushed. I ordered the egg white frittata topped with heirloom tomatoes, buratta, basil, & a balsamic drizzle. My husband had the breakfast sandwich & duck fat potatoes. Both our meals were incredible! 
My husband kept raving about how good the sausage was on his sandwich. The potatoes were perfectly cooked..crispy, not soggy, & tossed with some peppers that added a great flavor. Both portions were generous & priced reasonably. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both experiences were excellent. Glutton has a very unique menu with a lot of care taken to have surprising complimentary flavors. They use a wood fire grill and a large portion of dishes get the flame. The first time I was with my fiance and friends. We had some great appetizers and I had the burger ( not a normal burger ). Everythingwas beyond expectation. The second time I was with the future in laws and we all shared several dishes.  We had grilled japenese corn, calamari and stuffed olives. For the main corse we had a ribeye soecial, grilled shrinp, lamb meatballs, a chicken pasta dish and a rice dish with kimche  (sorry I forget all the proper dish names). Everything was unique and savory. We also got all of the deserts, but I did not sample them. I have not had a drink but everyone I have been with enjoyed the drinks or beer selection. The service is unbelievably good. I highly recommend trying Glutton. Next time I go I plan to go during the famius brunch."}
{"text":"We will definitely be returning! 

We made it to Glutton for the first time Tuesday night. We shares three plates and a dessert - the Peach Salad, Half Chicken, Brown Butter Gnocchi and Caramel Corn Profiteroles for dessert! Everything was superb. I always love sharing plates, and everything here was perfect size for that - we didn't get too full, but weren't left hungry or wanting more of a certain dish either. 

The wait staff was so friendly and helpful and made sure we always had full drinks and no dirty plates on our table. 

Thank you, Glutton!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this was crazy good.  We shared the french onion dip as an appetizer, I had the burger and my wife had the lamb meatballs.  It was all very good.  The burger was amazing.  Juicy, delicious.  The lamb meatballs were very good.  The tomato chutney is a bit sweet, but he flavor was great.  I had the smoke 'n bowl cocktail.  Very good.  We didn't stay long enough for me to try some of the other cocktails, but I will make sure to give them a taste very soon.  Service was great, and the staff was very knowledgeable of the menu.  I've already made reservations for a party."}
{"text":"There are some good share choices here, but honestly they have one of the best burgers I've ever had!  That's it!  I want to come back and have it again!  Loved the corn too!"}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is so delicious. Beet salad,calamari fries, broccolini, ravioli risotto special and scallops all delicious. Best dish hands down are the short ribs amazing and so tender with handmade noodles. Really cater to kids and people with allergies. Don't come here if you are on a diet. Love the smell of wood fired oven. Not a huge fan of the burger...love the industrial feel of the place"}
{"text":"My first visit was for brunch and it was fantastic. Great coffee and cocktails too and the service was really good. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ooh and ahhhs in every bite. We finally had the chance to try Glutton's dinner menu ...and it was fantastic! We ordered the refreshing shaved Brussels sprouts, kale and fennel salad generously seasoned with lemony dill and mustard seeds and Parmesan shavings; curried cauliflower with pickled shallots and chopped peanuts was a play on texture and spice; the wood grilled shrimps was garlicky good and a true testament that anything cooked in a 500F wood burning brick oven is phenomenal...perfectly charred and blistered but very tender. Our main course was the massive Glutton Burger and I had the well seasoned Turkey & Cured Guanciale Meatballs and Parmesan Polenta which was a delight. The cheesy and buttery polenta was a sweet departure from the usual suspect - pasta. The meatballs were moist, plump and seasoned to perfection a complement to the zesty marinara and generous basil chiffonade. Overall the experience was gratifying and we look forward to visit again. Ambiance was casual cool and unpretentious allowing patrons to focus on the wood burning brick oven and filling up ye wine glass."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on Memorial Day. There were only a few tables taken. They sit me at a table that was next to another group. During my meal, they sit another couple to the table next to me. The rest of the restaurant is empty and there is more than one server there. Can you space us out? I went here because it wasn't crowded. The frustration. I was giving the hostess the stink-eye the whole time.

I ordered an eggplant parm sandwich. It wasn't anything special. My server spilled drink on my table too."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've reviewed a restaurant on Yelp, and the burger at Glutton was so good tonight that it has inspired me to write!  I consider myself a pretty avid foodie and a big burger lover, and the top burgers in town thus far have been consistently Bachi and Gordon Ramsey.  The Best burger I've ever had was at Bradley Ogden at Caesars Palace and my burger world has not been the same since they closed back in 2012.  Even with Ogden's short lived place at Tivoli Village, the burger just wasn't quite the same there.
Thank you Glutton for bringing me back to the pure joy of biting into a burger and instantly knowing that this is something special and different!  
The glutton burger is different than the Bradley Ogden burger.  The BO burger was served with meat, bun and cheese if you wanted.  That's it...condiments on the side.
The Glutton burger prides itself on fresh made everything.  They've added a sweeter bun, homemade butter pickles, onion, lettuce and homemade cheese.  \"Everything from scratch,\" our waitress bragged!  And rightfully so.  I honestly have not had a burger that juicy since BO.  
So, mix this delicious patty in with a slew of condiments and you have a different, delicious gourmet burger experience. 
Imagine an awesome gourmet Big Mac!  Some may say, eew...Big Mac? But MickeyD's has it's place in burger lore (and I have found memories of eating my first Big Mac as a kid), I mean, it's what we grew up with.  I honestly haven't had a Big Mac in 20 years, but the Glutton burger is like (what I remember of) a Big Mac on steroids, with fresh greens and extra juicy flavor.
Top it off with a side of mushroom poutine fries (another favorite of mine...poutine!  Well done Canucks) and this is the best one/two punch in town!  But go for the burger, and the burger, and the burger.
Thank you for this Glutton...  
Best burger in Vegas!"}
{"text":"With a name like Glutton, I was expecting indulgent food- but there was nary a bone marrow, truffle-infused, or deep-fried dish on the menu, just your typical trendy-upscale-urban take on new American. Not that I'm complaining, it just doesn't fit with the logo and restaurant name.

PICKLED TOMATOES: Really, this dish should be called \"whipped ricotta WITH pickled tomatoes\" as the portion contains maybe six tomatoes and a fluffy heap of cheese. While I enjoyed this dish (hello, cheese and tomatoes with bread, what's not to love?!) and the criminally smooth texture, the flavors were a bit too subtle: cheese was mild to the point of being almost flavorless and the pickled tomatoes lacked any sort of vinegary or briney \"pickled\" taste. 
FURIKAKE STREET CORN: I'm not a huge corn fan, but I ordered this dish because it's getting rave reviews. It was just okay. A bit too much oil, but nicely charred kernels and interesting seasonings. 
WATERMELON & FETA SALAD: If the word \"feta\" is in the dish name, I expect more than a scant half-tablespoon in the entire salad. The salty, creamy notes that the cheese adds to this dish were almost nonexistent due to the skimpy portion used. That said, the textures and subtle sweetness of the watermelon, tomato, and cucumber together made for a fresh, vibrant summer dish.

Service was decent during my visit, and I enjoyed my seat at the kitchen bar watching the chefs in action. None of the dishes I ordered really lived up to the hype, or to the restaurant name. Perhaps dessert is where the gluttony kicks in: the PB&C and profitroles both sound great, I'll have to come back another time to find out.

ETA: It's not going to change my rating or anything, but the \"Buy a round for the kitchen for $5 to show your appreciation\" on the menu is extremely tacky."}
{"text":"Came in earlier tonight for dinner with my other half. We had the following from their dinner menu:

* truffle gougeres 
* pickled tomatoes
* squid ink pasta
* Japanese street corn
* tuna carpaccio 

For cocktails we each had an \"improved mule\" and shared the deer in the headlights.
 
I have nothing but praise for this place. Service was phenomenal from the start with the hostess, and then our server Justin made our dining experience so enjoyable because of his knowledge and enthusiasm regarding their menu. Everything we had was not good....but great. We will definitely be back but until then, I will spread the word.  With the boom downtown,  we have been trying new restaurants in the area, back to back.  Glutton is our favorite thus far."}
{"text":"Bookmarked this place to try and bring friends visiting from Milwaukee. Pretty cool place. 
The atmosphere was chill, and I definitely appreciated the background music which didn't make me feel like an old or snobby person. Entire staff was also friendly. I think our waiter's name was Justin. He checked on us multiple times during the meal, and was quite knowledgeable about the menu - great descriptions and recommendations of the dishes. 
For snacks/starters, we had the Spicy Pork Rinds and Pickled Tomatoes. Oh man... The Pork Rinds reminded me Cheetos, only infinitely better! The Pickled Tomatoes was a better version/play on Caprese. LOL. Maybe I just like grilled bread with a spread a lot more?
Most of the group ordered and liked their Glutton Burger. I think the only downside was that the boyfriend's and our friend's burgers got mixed up - meat was cooked differently. No biggie though. I most definitely liked my Spaghetti Carbonara. The poached egg made the sauce creamier, and Shiitaki mushrooms were definitely used right. Not to mention I rarely see it on menus, so it was a good change, especially as a substitution to bacon. Weird, right? 
Next visit, I'll be sure to try their desserts, specifically the Jar of Cake."}
{"text":"It's been great to see Downtown LV really transform over this past year. I've been lucky enough to watch the progress of many new spots, including Glutton and give them nothing but kudos for following their restaurant dreams.

Highlights:
Whipped Ricotta - spring peas, mint, pistachio chutney, grilled focaccia
Chicken Liver Mousse - bread & butter pickles + grilled bread
Carlsbad Oysters - banyuls mignatte, cucumber
Bread & Butter - house made parker house rolls, breakfast radish, cultured butter
Brown Butter Gnocchi - braised pork cheek, soy, safe, pine nut gremolata
Creekstone Farms Sirloin - peas & carrots, red wine reduction

I would order the ricotta again in a heart beat and loved the use of veggies throughout all the dishes. I'm not a huge oyster fan, but I saw them come out of the kitchen and had to give them a try. They ended up being really delightful with little cucumber chunks sprinkled on top. Also, homemade parker house rolls? Always a good thing but not really into having to pay $5 for house bread. 

Overall this neighborhood needs glutton and I wish these guys the best of luck!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate at glutton labor day weekend. The food was wonderful! We had the red snapper feature, fried rice, the chicken big plate dish, and Japanese street corner. Everything seasoned just right and fabulous flavors. The highlight was our server Jay (Justin Dobpe). He gave outstanding service. Everything from start to finish was wonderful with him. He is so passionate about the food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect for date-night. The ambiance is adorable and they have several different options for seating, including an inviting patio area. Their menu is made up of mostly tapas/small plate items, but  I had the burger and fries which were terrific. My burger was cooked to a perfect med-rare and I was able to have it served gluten free (sans bun). They also have creative, cool cocktails."}
{"text":"A five star rating from me speaks for itself! See my other reviews to know what that means. Excellent, eclectic food, perfectly prepared with imaginative taste combinations good enough to please any discerning gourmand including myself. You will not be disappointed!
The menu is divided into Small Plates and Big Plates along with a full preselected group for $40 which includes some specials not available a la carte."}
{"text":"Love this place. Especially our bartender Deidre (sorry if I misspelled her name) but the service is amazing. The drinks are for sure something to try. I tried 'Merica and Me Vida Roca which are super delicious! My bf tried the Mocha Stout and Deschutes IPA and loved it. So much better than any mainstream beer. One of the best local restaurants in downtown. :)"}
{"text":"So yummy, loved the butternut squash salad. The shaved Brussel sprouts salad was the bomb, loved it to bits!
Will be back when we visit next, maybe we'll try brunch here."}
{"text":"5 stars? Oh yes, you betcha this place deserves 5 stars. The staff is absolutely amazing and accommodating. When we walked in, we were asked where we would like to sit...  we chose the chef's counter (& I think you should too). The chef introduced himself & welcomed us. Totally a plus.
Staring at the menu, we realized that one of the main reasons we wanted to check this little spot out was not on the lunch menu... EPIC FAIL! However, the chef decided to accommodate us & make the dish that brought us in & it made our whole damn day!

Here it is folks... 

Pickled spring tomatoes
   &&&&&&&&&&&
Chicken liver mousse (special request granted!) 

Sounds like no big deal, huh? Yeah, you're wrong, The tomatoes came with a fluffy cloud of delicious ricotta & some huge slices of toasted bread.Let me tell you something, I had no idea tomatoes could be so incredible! 

The chicken liver mousse was everything we had hoped for. Creamy, flavorful & spot fricken on! That also comes with toasted bread so by the time we were finished with the two we were overstuffed! 

Oh, I almost forgot the pig roast cocktail. It is very interesting. Smoky & bacon flavored & definitely unique. 

I have read other reviews about how the plates are small . . .  that is what it is meant to be. Grab a few plates and share. My husband & I didn't walk away hungry & the bill wasn't bad either. They are a new & hip place with a down to earth crew. Love it. We WILL visit again when we're in Vegas. Good luck on your new success, Glutton!"}
{"text":"The name of this place says it all...

Clean, modern, intimate & cozy is how this place feels & looks and I really enjoyed the space. Great job on every detail! One big downer was the air conditioning. We were warm throughout the entire meal which really sucked. It's over 100 in Vegas everyday now and I need some serious air action everywhere I go.

The cocktails are interesting & ambitious and they helped with the temperature issue. The Merica cocktail was perfection. The Japanese corn was so sweet & equally salty from spices, great start to any meal. The fig & prosciutto pizza was again a great balance of sweet & savory and then the star of the show, the brown butter gnocchi! Show stopper! The gnocchi were little light pillows of heaven & the pork cheek was drenched in decadent sauce that was incredibly flavorful. 

Everything we tasted was brilliant except for the dessert. Ending on a disappointing note sucked and with us sweating at dinner I couldn't give them a 5 star rating but the food & service really deserved it. The dessert was supposed to be chocolate cream crullers. What we received were dense hot doughnuts with watery chocolate sauce and a cream foam. It definitely didn't meet our expectations and we ended on a bad note. Crullers should be airy and that was the biggest negative of the evening. 

I think this place is amazing & I'm once again pleasantly surprised with Downtown! So many kick ass places! 

Fix the air issue and remove the crullers and all is good here."}
{"text":"The ambiance is very nice. The wait staff was slow when I ate here for lunch. It wasn't even busy, maybe 12 people total that covered 4 tables. Can I get my check already? I hate asking for it. Did I mention that the place is nice? It's located downtown Las Vegas. I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and a steak salad. Total came to $31.35, and it wasn't even worth it considering the size of the salad and the pour of wine in my glass. My steak salad was more fitting for an anorexic business associate pretending to be eating lunch with her colleagues such as the two  women sitting at the table on my right. HA! Seriously tho, I spent $36 plus tip and I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. Recommend their eggs Benedict; perfectly poached eggs with braised pork and roasted potatoes (a little dry). Good coffee. Apple fritters are perfectly sweet and gooey. Overall good place. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"So this is where all the good food is hiding in Vegas. Whenever in Vegas, I always hate dining at the restaurants on the Strip. I feel like they're all tourist traps and the food is always overpriced and mediocre at best, minus the (very few) exceptions. Skip the mediocre and pretentiousness go discover the hidden gems that are in Downtown.

Staying on Fremont St over the weekend, I wanted to checkout a nearby restaurant for Breakfast. As soon as we walked up to EAT, we saw the humongous line outside and quickly decided it was not worth the wait. Went across the street and discovered Glutton! At first, I wasn't sure of the place as the name of the restaurant suggested they probably had unhealthy options. As soon as we walked in though, I was pleasantly surprised with the decor and atmosphere and the FOOD...omg the FOOD looked amazing and unique and oh so Instagram worthy. Scoping around at everyone's tables, I knew we were in the right place.

They were pretty busy but the kitchen bar area was open so we took it. Needless to say, I was really impressed with our meal, drinks, and service. Even though they were really busy, they never forgot to attend to us. We love this place so much, we came back twice during our stay. 

What we ordered:
- Pork Benedict
- Chicken hash
- Breakfast salad
- Chicken salad sandwich
- Cinnamon roll
- Lemon coffee cake
- And coffee...make sure to get their coffee! It's SO GOOD.

I really appreciated their amazing service and attentiveness. Totally different experience than other Vegas restaurants on the Strip. Couldn't recommend this place enough, every item we ordered were nothing less than perfect...just take a look at these pics!"}
{"text":"Well what's not to love at this place!!!! The cooks and the bartender are allowed to be creative with their craft which in turn allows them to be passionate about what they do and really put love into what they make! I ordered the zucchini Parmesan which is vegetarian (btw I'm am NOT vegetarian I LOVE meat) and I was Worried this wouldn't satisfy or fill me but man was I wrong!!!! Not only did it satisfy me but I was super full. It was a sandwich that consisted of fried zucchini with arugula, tomato sauce, burrata and of course Parmesan and fries on side. It was delicious!!!! To top it off the bartender let us try new drinks he was creating for the new menu. Needless to say I am definitely  coming back very soon to try the new menu."}
{"text":"Disappointed there were no gluten free - egg free choices on the very limited brunch menu.  I had a side of fruit.  The cocktails were pretty good, however."}
{"text":"Over-salted home fries and debatable pork sausage in the basic breakfast plate was a disappointment. Was hoping for better."}
{"text":"Glutton should change its name to portion control.  We were told that they are popular for ordering a few meals and sharing with your party.  Please.  One of the items we ordered was their shrimp and grits... try 2 pieces of shrimp and maybe a tablespoon of grits spread thinly on a platter.  Talk about misleading.  Definitely not worth the price paid.  Btw, the drink I ordered was maybe a 4 Oz cocktail for $12... save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I loved it! Arrived for an early lunch and we were the only people in the restaurant. The server sold me on a special they were cooking up that day, and amazing pork sandwich. It was probably the best thing I have tasted in a long time! Props to the chef and the team behind Glutton. They bring amazing culinary creations to the downtown area. Definitely will return soon."}
{"text":"We are always looking for an informal not too expensive place to eat dinner before going to the Smith Center. Based on the reviews, Glutton seemed to be a reasonable option. It is located 5 minutes from the Smith Center across the street from the Container Park.
Ambience: very informal in a very hip type of way. No tablecloths, unpadded seats, a couple of high top tables, exposed vent ceiling, open kitchen, relatively small bar with a TV in the rear, Spartan decorating.
Service: our server, Stacy, was at our table almost immediately after we sat down. She was very warm and welcoming. She explained several of the items on the menu. We needed time to navigate the menu and she was appropriate in giving us that time. There were 5 servers working the room with only about 15 tables in the room. Service was very attentive,  excellent. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I did not find the service overbearing. Stacy checked in on us at reasonable intervals to make sure that we did not need anything.
Food: the menu is really very limited. The night we wish here there were only 8 cases for small plates 7 cases for large plates, and one flat bread. Stacy explained that the menu varies depending on what is in season, and that should be a good thing. When you were trying to share dishes, finding things that each of you would like on a limited menu is a bit of a challenge. We ended up choosing the ahi tuna tacos from the small plates and the cavatelli and short rib from the large plate menu. The chef should get bonus points for the presentation of each of the dishes. The taco dish came with 4 small tacos in a very crisp shell. The ahi was garnished with sweet chili guacamole, frisee, and pickled Fresno pepper. Delish. The short rib dish came with a fairly small piece of short rib in a bowl with confetti, some wild mushrooms, & a large dollop of truffle mousse. All of that swimming in a beef broth. Quite tasty. Best described as comfort food. The best dish of the night was the desert. Caramel corn profiteroles. A great way to finish the meal.
Value: the overall dining experience was just what I was looking for. Informal, relatively quick. However, I feel it was a bit pricey for what you got."}
{"text":"We just happened upon this large bit of heaven and have had both brunch and dinner. The chefs are so incredibly  creative and talented I wish I lived here!!!!!

It is a quaint little cozy spot that feels warm and friendly.  The food is seasonal and a culinary delight!

The waitstaff is exceptional as well.  Stacey was very helpful with the menu and patient with us because we wanted it all!  The mixologist Dean was a charm and the chef seems very aware of what is going on the front of the house. Glutton has great team that is there to make sure you have a great exceptional culinary experience.  Thank you Glutton!"}
{"text":"Food here is absolutely delicious!! Great customer service to go along with their amazing food. I had the Hevous Rancheros and my wife had the Glutton Burger. Honestly I'd have to say that this is the best food joint downtown. We have been to Eat which is right across the street and we really liked that place but hands down Glutton is the best thus far. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about this place. Everything we ordered was spectacular! All of the flavors blended and complemented each other perfectly- never masking one another. We ordered the butternut squash angolotti and the short ribs. They were both as perfect as you could imagine and the desserts were mouth watering good! The cauliflower appetizer was also perfect. It's been a long time since I have experienced a 3 course meal like this. Every plate was designed perfectly!!! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Our crew ravishingly polished off a fine meal here the morning after a large evening. Though sober, I personally ate as though I had a hangover and singlehandedly devoured a Cinnamon roll the size of an infants head and the baked tomato/egg/cheese fit for a queen. Friends also had a waffle, chicken hash, classic breakfast and poached eggs/toast.  Brad our server was cool -- and the kitchen staff kept it hot and lively entertaining us with their antics during a busy morning. Gotta love an open kitchen !
I can not wait to fat out here again one day."}
{"text":"I walked in a few minutes before my friend showed.  :) I figured I was just gonna wait at the door but the hostess was like have a seat at the bar while u wait and boy am I glad that I listened to her.  :)

Alex was the bartender on duty and he was fantastic!  There was another bartender at the beginning and I didn't catch his name BUT Alex was perfect.  He knew the drinks and he knew the food.  Guided me and my friend to great drinks and great food.  :)

We started out with the whipped ricotta and picked tomatoes.  The bread that was served with it was perfect. Perfectly charred to add flavor whatever you are eating with it. I spread on the whipped ricotta and was thinking that it might be a little bland as ricotta unless it is seasoned heavily tends to be bland.  Boy was I wrong.  It was delicious.  Add the tomatoes and it adds a different nuance to the entire plate.  It was so good. :)

We also ordered the chicken liver mousse with port wine reduction If u don't like stuff like this don't order it BUT if u love this kind of stuff...ORDER it.  Lol it was delicious.  It was so creamy and full of flavor but it was not heavy at all. It was very light and very airy and the port wine reduction added just the right amount of sweetness to the dish.  :)

Then we had the glutton burger with mushroom poutine fries as a side.  Alex let us know that we could just make the fries into the poutine instead of getting fries on top of fries as we had been considering getting the poutine as an extra side.  :)  We also got another side of the shredded Brussel sprouts (our healthy dish of the night....lol).  So ask the server/bartender....u never know how they will guide u. 

The burger was juicy and well seasoned. Yummy!!!! :) The mushroom poutine....mushroom and cheesy heaven.  Lol The Brussel sprouts....healthy and yet delicious!!!!

I almost forgot the drinks.  Lol they had rodenbach grand cru on tap!  I love sour beers and it is rare for me to find one on tap.  So that totally made my day.  :)  they also had a stout....and yup normally I do not like stout beers....BUT this was so yummy!  It had strong coffee and chocolate tones and it was not heavy at all.   This might convert me to like stouts! Lol but get there soon as when the barrel is gone....so is that stout!!!! :)

Definitely planning another trip back here!  So many other items to try.  :)"}
{"text":"Unique food that is delicious and great service!  I had the half chicken. The corn cake and slaw it sits on is incredible.  Nice urban setting in old Vegas!"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced, but the setting and service was good. Opposite of other reviews, our food was a bit over salted/spiced. We had the carbonara, short rib which were both great, but lacking in portion size. The cioppino was really spicy and overpriced , but the glutton burger was excellent and big enough for two. After looking at other tables we were disappointed on portion sizes which we had seen on Yelp and helped decide on this location. It seems they're more into the craft beer menu than the food side of things. Just another downtown overpriced hipster hangout."}
{"text":"I love EVERYTHING about this place! I have been here to eat 4 different times, tried something different everytime, and left feeling gluttonous and satisfied each time. Service is always amazing as ive been in groups of 4, 2 and myself and its aleays consistent. My drinks r never empty, the servers and bartenders r easy to strike up a covo with but not overbearing. I had the benedict which was amazing, calamari fries with unagi sauce which i had to finish because the flavors were too mind blowing to share. Ive tried the curry cauliflower which was so flavorful especially considering i dont like cauliflower and id order this again. Ice had smoked sea bass on a crostini type bread and i made my friend (who HATES fish) try it and she didn't believe me it was fish and took a second bite! The bloody mary is def top 2 of the best bloody marys I've ever had. Its huge and has a ginormous prawn on it only complaint is my NOTHING! hard to believe with hiw picky i am but true! 

 Now my favorite part of glutton as a restaurant my very first time coming in my server was amazing his name is Justin and he recommended for me to get the glutton burger man was I happy I trusted him. This burger is huge for starters the meat was cooked perfectly and still had its juices and flavor and was so tender the pickles we're so good I wish I could buy a jar of them to take home. And recently I found out they make the pickles in house it came with some skinny shoestring fries and I love french fries and a burger but I didn't even touch my fries as his burger was so amazing I'm not sure what kind of cheese it comes with but it's one of the best cheeses I've ever had instantly a timeless classic everybody who comes to this restaurant needs to try this burger you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast or brunch...or probably any meal!  We came here because our other choice had a 2 hour wait, wow what a find. A new American menu using local ingredients with a fresh open kitchen and wood burning oven, community seating or regular.  We took the community seating, got to mingle with a couple from the Las Vegas area, who loved this restaurant. I had the baked eggs in roasted tomato sauce and crunchy kale- Omg, so delish, eggs were a bit overdone, but it was cooked in their wood oven so the entire dish has a bit of a smoked flavor the tomato sauce was fresh chunky, seasoned well and superb, kale was fresh and made this delicious.  Also had their zucchini muffin, served warm in a square pan, sweet, light airy and fresh served with a side of maple butter, so delicious as a starter for under 5 bucks. Hubby got the French toast with fresh fruits of strawberry and blueberries with warm real maple syrup, 2 thumbs up.  The menu is great, execution of dishes and fresh ingredients are superb, very crowded with locals and some tourists, but they know where to find good food! They were super busy when we went, so we needed to ask to fill water glasses and coffee, but no big deal.  Friendly hostesses and wait staff, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a cute, little spot downtown. There's bar seating and then several tables. Definitely a small-ish dining room. It's modern-ish and minimalistic. The service was wonderful - very attentive. The menu isn't particularly lengthy, but everything sure sounded tasty. We weren't super hungry, so we opted for a couple of appetizers. We have the shrimp and french onion dip. The french onion dip was seriously delicious. I definitely love me some chips and dip. And bonus, there were PLENTY of dip. You definitely don't run out of dip before you run out of things to dip in it. And that's a rarity. The shrimp were large, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked. The beer, wine, and cocktail list is decently extensive. It wasn't cheap, but it sure was tasty."}
{"text":"Everything that we ate was delicious.  The server has a real pro and gave us excellent customer service.  The open kitchen and the design of the place gave us lots of eye candy while we were waiting for our food.  The beer and wine lists are awesome.  What disappoints me so much that I cannot bring myself to rate this higher is the name not living up the portion sizes.  If I went into this place expecting it to be a tapas experience, I would have probably rated it 4 or 5 stars based on my experience.  But with a name and logo like Glutton, I expect to be full and happy when I leave.  Instead, after sharing at least 10-12 dishes with my party (we each got 2-3 things), we all left slightly confused and still hungry, despite having paid a pretty penny for the dining experience we just had.  We ended up getting dinner immediately afterwards at Park on Fremont."}
{"text":"The burgers were fantastic. The bartender was a great dude.  It was definitely a good choice on our visit to LV"}
{"text":"Every time I come in, the service is outstanding, the food is outstanding and the wine selection is outstanding. This place is all around perfect. Downtowns hidden gem, get your ass there."}
{"text":"Had lunch for the first time here on a Thursday, and couldn't couldn't wait to get my wife out the next night here for dinner. We each had a refreshing cocktail, and instead of eating the main entrees, decided on sampling off the 'snacks' and 'small plates'. We were overwhelmed with the quality, freshness, and taste of EVERYTHING we tried. Crazy good.

Justin was our server. Very professional and friendly, as well as the entire staff.

Make the effort to visit Glutton - outstanding across the board!"}
{"text":"I went here recently and placed an order to go. I ordered the Brown butter gnocchi and Peach Cobbler. The service was very good and friendly, though the portion for the Gnocchi was extremely small, there were only six tiny tubes and only one small piece of the braised pork cheek. I was shocked at how small the portion was on this item, definitely not worth the price of $10.00. As for the peach cobbler it was a nice size portion and the taste was good, though could have been just a bit sweeter. I will try the place a second time and will eat in rather than taking out."}
{"text":"This place is the hotter than a vegas day. Have you ever had everything you ate from a place just make you ooze with joy and subsequent bewilderment? This is that kind of place. The turnovers were a subject of post-meal discussion for at least 24 hours. The frittata with buratta is yum. The service was super attentive and chill. Definitely go here and thank me after."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Appetizers are really good!! Corn and Pork Rhine's were extremely tasty. Recommendation is to come for brunch. Definitely their best option!!"}
{"text":"When I first sat down I thought it was going to be an ok experience. As I looked at the menu I thought it was too eccentric and didn't like what I was looking at. Nothing looked that appealing. So we ordered the burger and fries, garganelli pasta, curried cauliflower and the shaved Brussel sprouts. It was all AMAZING! Outstanding and unique flavors and great presentation! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on multiple occasions and this place exceeds my expectations each and every time. The food is amazing. The cheddar pork rinds are a must get! And practically anything else on the menu. The staff are very friendly and the ambiance overall is chill with a few splashes of hipster. I would recommend this place to all of my friends for any and all kinds of occasions."}
{"text":"Omigosh! It has been a long time since new food has made me happy. Everything tried was tasteful, beautifully presented, and uniquely flavored. I had a very hard time choosing my favorites.

For this trip, my favorites were the two off menu items: Louisiana Style Shrimp w/Pork Belly on Cheddar Grits and Chocolate Croissant Bread Pudding w/Candy Bar Ice Cream. The other items tried were the Wood Fired Eggplant Caponata, Curried Cauliflower, Roasted Root Vegetables, and Scallops.

I suppose I could gush all night about the blending of flavors, the surprising presentation of the eggplant (kinda like a chunky salsa or jam), the creamy texture of the grits, the curry that didn't overpower the cauliflower, the root veggie dish that I could honestly eat every day, the perfectly seared scallops, and the wonderful smell and taste of rich dark chocolate, but I will spare you. To put it simply;  what wonderful tastes...what a wonderful food experience.

So looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I knew they were opening because of our many visits to EAT across the street.  It is a very small place,  reminded me of restaurants in DTLA. I've worked in fine dining at the Bellagio since it opened.  I really enjoyed the food.  We sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen.  JAMES, the oven cook gave us a real show.  We will come back very soon.  If you visit,  please order a post shift beer for the kitchen.  It's only $5. Mgmt, please work on host staff and mgmt thanking guests as they leave.  This is your last chance to make an impression,  take it. Other than that,  a very good experience."}
{"text":"We only went for dessert but the desserts were off the meter! We got the popcorn puffs and the peach cobbler. The cobbler was probably the best I've ever had. And I'm quite the connoisseur! We had interaction with 3-4 servers and all were incredibly friendly. What a great atmosphere! Can't wait to go back and try the food."}
{"text":"Super IMPRESSED.  I brought my Meetup group down with 10 people and they where very accommodating and the workers were super awesome and friendly.  

The food is very unique with great tastes and flavors.  They have an incredible menu and if you look at the pics on Yelp, they are to die for.  All our plates came out looking and tasting great.

I love the resurgence of east side downtown.  Its changed - if you havent been downtown to the new places you are MISSING out.!"}
{"text":"This place is cool, just like a lot of other places downtown recently and full of hipsters which can be a good or a bad thing.  In this case, it was a good thing.  The food was great.  I have had things that I have never even heard of before.  The staff was very excited about the food here.  I like my food.  I like it to be tasty.  I like it to be big.  I like to to be reasonably priced.  The food was definitely tasty.  The food was small but I wasn't hungry afterwards which means it was proportioned nicely.  The food was overpriced for the size, but not for the creativity and execution.  I very much enjoyed trying this place but I don't think I will go back unfortunately.  It is too far from my house and could have offered a bit more, in terms of food, and cost a bit less.  You should definitely give it a try though."}
{"text":"Had lunch there for the first time meal was good loved the Gem Caesar Salad and they use Black Garlic in their dressing, Glutton Burger and Apple Cobbler.  Was a good place to go with friends, casual, reasonable pricing and good service and you can walk to Container Park."}
{"text":"I've found my new favorite spot.  Fresh, clean, great quality food and service. Craft beer was super good.  I had a shrimp scampi egg white omelet EPIC. Also tried the chicken and potato smoked hash with pooched eggs. AMAZING. Tried the fresh squeezed IPA that too was amazing.  Got to try the special grapefruit beer they had too  really good.  I recommend everyone try its brunch. Support local business. And eat healthy. 



Again went back was impressed all over again.  Get the breakfast salad.  To die for."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot! Everything from the wine to our entree was completely immaculate. This is my new spot, definitely coming back every week, or more! (If possible )

Also, STACEY is a total sweetheart and totally attentive. Thank you Stacey for incredible service!"}
{"text":"Took the family to dinner.  Our girls had the burger (which is the best burger you'll ever have.  Even at well done it was juicy! Husband & I had shrimp app & tuna tacos. Shrimps are huge. You'll love this appetizer. We always split everything we order here  Carbonara & NY strip Entrée were new on the menu and both were amazing!! And you can't  leave this place without ordering desserts. Lol. Ice cream flavors are to die for. Great service & great food !!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible arrogant manager. It's a shame, because it's a cute restaurant with decent food, and I love to try and support new local places. Their manager is so poorly skilled at problem resolution and exudes so much arrogance, it's appalling. I was charged twice (not authorizations, actual posted charges). But I only signed for one charge. I called and was polite and friendly and wanted to have them reverse the 2nd charge. 

He basically told me it was my responsibility to prove this charge wasn't mine, that I needed to provide him with the authorization number, that I needed to contact my bank, that I needed to bring receipts, etc. Why should I have to do all this work for a charge that wasn't mine, that I didn't sign for???? I asked to speak to the owner, and he said \"We are in the middle of lunch and he is busy, and just the fact that I took your call (you are lucky).\" I said, \"wow you are unbelievable\" he said, \"YES I AM\".

Wow...awful. I love to support local businesses, but never will I go back here. And I am filing fraud charges with my bank. They ran my card and put through a charge I DID NOT SIGN FOR. Be cautious."}
{"text":"I wish that I had never given out 5 stars before so that I could give this place a crown of olympic gold. No kidding. 
Atmosphere: Open, inviting, plenty of seating. Good for Family style or for adventurous first dates.  I'll be honest, we started the evening by putting our name on a waiting list for Carson's Kitchen, as we had previously eaten there and it was great... but they wanted us to wait \"30-40 minutes\" when over 1/2 the restaurant was open! I used to be a hostess so I know how to account for a wait list and that was ridiculous. We were walking past Glutton while we were waiting and saw a fellow we knew so we joined in and they accommodated the change from 2 people to 6 in a breeze.

Food:
Watermelon Salad. Order two or don't order it.
Japanese Street Corn is the better version of  Mexican street corn
Squid Ink Linguine- Black like my soul but light on the flavor, don't be scared
Shaved Brussels, easy.
I wish we had been able to try Garganelli!!
I can't stop, order everything, you won't be disappointed.
We had 6 small plates and 3 large plates among 5 people and it was just enough to leave room for three decadent desserts.  you Must have the desserts if you enjoy living. 

The service!!! What a team! It's not a regular place where just one server takes your order and brings your food, the chef, the bartender, the entire staff are there to make sure that everything is timed to a T and delivered to exceed. It was 104 in Vegas and none of our water glasses ran dry even once. 

We tried to go back again, but it was a Monday and they were closed. I can't even be mad about it because if I owned a business I would be closed Monday too."}
{"text":"So delicious and really great service. I had the watermelon salad and my boyfriend had the glutton burger! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My girl and I visited Glutton on Friday and was delighted. Justin our server made us feel at home and recommend some great eats. From the Japanese  corn to the calamari fries to the best burger in town to the Improved Mule, everything was perfectly prepared and tasted jummy!!! Easily one of the best places to eat in vegas. Been dreaming about the burger since!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came to the Fremont area for dinner on a recommendation from a local and we were not disappointed. The food and drinks at Glutton were unique, well crafted and delicious. Our server was very informative and clearly proud of the menu and chefs. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is welcomed addition to the downtown scene!  I looked through Eater to find a new spot that was hot on the map and landed here.  We live on the West side and try to make it downtown to the more local scene as much as we can and in the midst of all the new commotion that is happening in the Carson street area Glutton hits the mark!  

We had the Peach and Burrata Salad, of which my girlfriend fought me for the last bite with her fork in trident position, the Brown Butter Gnocchi (a bit over cooked, but the braised pork cheek was so tender and had beautiful flavor), the Half Chicken (Chicken was juicy and had a wonderful wood fired skin that I stole immediately) and the Carmel Corn Profiteroles.  My only disappointment is that the Profiteroles seemed a bit on the store bought side and had no flake to them, but the flavor of the dessert and the carmel corn was really tasty, (mind you I am not a dessert guy, but I do love me some salted caramel anything really.).

It has a Patio in the back for those who don't want to hang in the main restaurant dining area, (which was FRIGED!! ), a small bar to the back of the restaurant that seats 5-6 max and the general decor is somewhat thought out but looks a bit standard with lots of two top tables that you find in a local pizza shop.  Cute and unpretentious but doesn't do the food justice.

All in all the food was great, the service was exactly as we wanted it, (I like to be left alone so I can actually enjoy my meal without being bothered every 2 minutes).  We had Brad and he was solid with lots of suggestions.  The only thing I might suggest is that you also inform your other staff of what is actually on the menu.  They didn't seem very aware of the food or have knowledge of it in any real sense.  Everyone should know your menu from the Chefs to the bussers, you never know who will ask a question and you should never hear \"I don't know\".  How about \"I'll get someone who can answer your question more accurately as I have yet to try that dish.\"  Just a thought.

Thanks Glutton I will be back to try something new very soon!"}
{"text":"Love the Boozy brunch, great drinks (kimchi Bloody Mary?!) and the chicken hash was both pretty and well-executed."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Glutton burger is delish. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I'm so happy we are finally getting some great Culinary talent that isn't inside a hotel. It's refreshing to be able to stop in without trekking miles. I've been for lunch and dinner which were both really yummy. I look forward to returning to try more options.

These are the menu items I've tried and wholeheartedly recommend:

Zucchini Parmesan Sandwich - The burrata, basil aioli, arugula, san marzano tomatoes, parmigiano reggiano were a fabulous compliment to the zucchini, so many great flavors going on. 

Truffle Gourgeres - Split these with my Hubs. Warm, cheesy, gooey, flavorful deliciousness. I could make a meal of these. Perfect accompaniment with a glass of crisp white wine or an ice cold martini

Mushroom Poutine - A very messy interesting dish with good flavor.  Great for splitting with friends and chasing with a cold beer.

Glutton Burger - Huge!  I had a bite and it was GOOD!

Brown Butter Gnocchi with Braised Pork Cheeks - I saved the best for last... This dish seriously made me weak in the knees.  The braised pork cheeks were tender and delectable.  The sauce was beyond sublime, it reminded me of my Culinary school days & my Saucier class. (I gained 10 pounds that semester!) the gnocchi was perfect & I loved the texture and how it was lightly grilled outside.

Everyone from host to wait staff to Dean (the awesome bartender) to the Chef were friendly and welcoming.  I truly hope this place makes it in the tumultuous restaurant world.  I want to make this my regular place for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Had a date night here last week and was expecting something similar to Carson's Kitchen or eat but I was pretty disappointed.

I was surprised that the place wasn't too busy - it was 7:30. Maybe that's too early? I'm not sure. Anyway, the minute we sat down it all pretty much went to shit. 

Our waitress started out nice but by the end of the meal - I'm so sorry to say - she was beyond overbearing. In fact, the staff felt overbearing. The waitress came to us four different times in a matter of 10 minutes to ask if we decided what we wanted. It was our first time and we were still looking over the menu. Finally the final time, instead of asking for a couple more minutes, she hovered over us until we ordered. When she asked if we wanted alcohol and we said no, she rolled her eyes. I looked over at the bartender who seemed pretty bored so I figured she's just trying to give him something to do. We told her we aren't drinking at the moment yet she continued to offer us alcohol for the duration of our meal. Even with dessert.

Our dishes slowly started coming out one by one and for each dish our waitress thought it would be cool to explain, in detail, the different ways that people eat them and two times even talked to us for an annoyingly three minutes straight on her personal life and her son and past customers, etc. I appreciate the enthusiasm (for lack of a better word), but we are really just trying to have a date night and talk. I don't need to hear about your son's birthday experience in full detail. And OMG, not to mention that you take two sips of your water and someone IMMEDIATELY comes to refill your glass. After a while it was just a distraction. I drink a lot of water which meant that every couple minutes - literally COUPLE of minutes - someone came by and interrupted to fill the glass. Not once was my glass half empty and it became such a distraction because they were also constantly walking by to get to a table near you and this place isn't even big.

The food was blah. The Brussels sprouts salad was way too dressed, the \"spicy\" pork rinds literally tasted like cheetos except on a pork rind instead of a chip (complete with orange stained fingers) and it wasn't spicy at all. The popcorn ice cream was good but I was hoping that the bread the ice cream was in was warm - something on that plate should've been warm. The only dish I enjoyed was the gnocchi. For the prices I will not be coming back to this place. I didn't enjoy myself."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!!  We tried the Straight Up Breakfast and the Smoked Chicken Hash. Very filling!!!  Atmosphere  was very upbeat. Service was awesome! No wait on a Saturday morning. Parking wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner experience!  Our group of 5 selected six small plates and one large plate and shared them.  The food was to die for! The Ahi Tuna Tacos were sooooo good!  And, if you are looking for an innovative and fresh drink, you've gotta try the Cucumber is the New Tonic!  But what really made the evening fantastic was Stacey's table service... she was attentive, informative, helpful and funny!   One of our group said, \"best dinner I have ever had!\"   Thank you, Glutton!"}
{"text":"I started with a water and Mr Q Cumber sparkling soda, which is out of this world. I was there for brunch so of course I would order more than I should. I picked out the watermelon salad and the straight-up breakfast plate. The breakfast plate was good. Nothing mind blowing but I very much enjoyed it. The watermelon salad was fantastic, and not just because I'm a sucker for anything watermelon. There was pieces of hazelnut, if I remember correctly, and that was the cherry on top of this mouthgasm. I left. proudly feeling like their logo, ready to burst out of my shirt. Very happy with the Fremont area restaurants so far. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Give it a few months, and I guarantee you will have a long wait for brunch on the weekends here. Sure it's on a popular downtown corner with 2 other places that serve breakfast and brunch. But this is Vegas, Downtown Vegas, and we have room for all 3. Especially when Glutton serves Bloody Mary's with shrimp, and duck-fat potatoes. 
I have yet to indulge in dinner, but after 2 very filling brunches, I can't wait to return. 
Both times I have dined, were Saturday mornings, and upon arrival the place was dead! 
WHY it was dead confuses the hell outta me, because the food is delicious and the service is superb. 
I highly recommend the proper breakfast sandwich if you like sausage. Its a patty that's like a burger! And the peach waffle with mascarpone whip and bourbon syrup, need I say more?
I also really enjoyed the cocktails. The 'Merica is like an adult lemonade. The Evan's colors is a refreshing cucumber cocktail. And the Glutton Mary, is pretty much an appetizer as it comes with pickled veggies and a big ol shrimp! Speaking of cocktails, right now they are doing a \"parking meter payout\". Basically, show that you paid to park weekdays between 4:30 and 6:30 PM, (after work crowd) and get 2-4-1 cocktails. Sign me up for 'Merica's til I can't walk please!
I can't wait to try more food here. Welcome to downtown Vegas, Glutton. 

P.S. It's glutton, like a glutton for punishment. The table next to me actually asked the waitress if it meant \"glutton free\", meaning gluten. I didn't think this was a needed disclaimer, but just in case."}
{"text":"The food was super salty. Had the burger, all you could taste is salt. It's too bad because the toppings seemed so promising. The side salad tasted like vinegar and salt. I'm going to be swollen for a week!"}
{"text":"User locally grown food,  good cocktail menu,  duck fat potatoes - did not taste the duck fat.  Texas toast looked like regular toast.  I had to ask 3 times for salt and pepper. We had to wait 20 mins to order. I spoke to manager but got a weak apology. Not going back there."}
{"text":"Inhaling copious amounts of food is the idea, unfortunately that's not the case here. The portions are miniature and barely enough for one person; if you want to share, that's pushing it. I understand the high prices reflect the area of downtown, yet the entire dinner I was left wanting more from each dish; the 4 tablespoon portions were a tease. My date and I struggled sharing the food since we had to be mindful to conserve a fair taste for each other. I've dined at \"small plate\" style restaurants in downtown, for example Carson Kitchen and didn't have this issue.

Brandade Rangoon $11 (salt cod, garlic, potato, cream cheese, honey) - These were imaginative and a unique spin on our beloved crab Rangoon. I tasted the subtle salt cod, the garlic and potato was smooth and the cream cheese made it velvety. I loved the pop of sweetness that the honey added - I just wished they added more or drizzled it on top of the Rangoon. Rated: 4/5

Japanese street corn $5 (miso butter, furikake, chives) - I appreciate it being served cored, making it easy to eat. Also, lots of the corn bits were charred and crispy adding a wonderful texture. It was slightly sweet and delicately seasoned by the miso butter and chives. I didn't taste or see the furikake, but the corn was still tasty regardless. Rated: 4/5

Brown butter gnocchi $16 (braised pork cheeks, soy, sage, pine nut gremolata) - The overall dish was lacking salt and it could use texture. I found the soft gnocchi average and the braised pork cheeks boring. Try dumping all of your Japanese street corn into the brown butter gnocchi - we loved that combination! The gnocchi needed some crisp texture and that really helped! Rated: 3/5

We really wanted to try the maple & mascarpone cheesecake with walnut crust, blueberry & preserved lemon, but alas they ran out. So we opted for the Churro & hot chocolate $8 (cinnamon sugar churros, chipotle spiced hot chocolate, & marshmallow) - The hot chocolate's \"chipotle spice\" flavor was super weak and it was served room temperature. Even after they warmed it up for us, it was not something I wanted to continue drinking. The churros were moist and custard-y inside, but everything was a total lackluster for me. If I'm going to consume the extra calories, I want it to taste better than OK. Rated: 3/5

3 \"small plates\" a drink and dessert totaled $46.49. The food was decent but not a knockout, there were too many simple mistakes that could have saved the meal. They weren't busy when we arrived, yet the service was off: distracted hostess, under-seasoned dish, unavailable dessert item on the menu, hot cocoa served room-temperature & a forgotten soda - these minor issues added up to a forgettable dining experience."}
{"text":"Sometimes being a glutton for delicious food tends to backfire in your face (or stomach).  Such was the case of my experience at Glutton.  My gut instinct was telling me to walk away when the buzzing of house flies made it a mini-game of keep away as we swatted around our food to protect it.  Surely, if that weren't enough to turn us away, it would be the undercooked noodles, that paired with their braised short rib, or the distasteful rangoon made from some type of fish (my wife and I were not fans.)  

However, we were in the area and while my wife could not eat the food, I did not want it (and our money) to go to waste so I took it down.   It was a stupid decision for me and a lifelong lesson to remember.

That night (without having eaten anything else but this food) I awoke up to extreme cramping and eventual trips to the bathroom on multiple occasions.  I eventually kept throwing up even with nothing left to throw up.  For 24 hours I could not keep anything down and I was confined to my bed room and my puke bag.  It was not an experience I ever want to feel again.

Life-lesson learned?  Do not eat something that your gut-instinct is telling you to push away.  Secondly, if the store just opened its doors for dinner (5 PM) and there are already house flies annoying buzzing around, it's time to fly away yourself."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, and I can honestly say, both were two of the best meals I've had in Vegas in a very long time. 
Warm, friendly, genuine servers. Skilled kitchen staff. And attention to every component in the dish. Simply perfect.
As much as I want to keep this place to myself, I have to shout from the rooftops how much I love Glutton!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! Their handmade pasta is simply delicious and their pork grinds taste like florescent Cheetos (idk why they're so bright, but who cares they're delish)."}
{"text":"Came into Glutton for lunch today and Couldn't have been happier. The \"Glutton\" Burger lived up to the Hype for sure. It's a scratch Kitchen and everything is made in house. Talented Chefs for sure!! Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"FROM THE FOOD TO THE SERVICE, FANTASTIC!!!!! Let me just start with the homemade Parker rolls with salted butter are worth the trip alone!!!! O don't leave without trying the home made hot pork rhines!!! What a great night with great food and service and the most reasonable bill in Vegas!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Most underrated restaurant downtown. I could eat here everyday. Always updating the menu, always tasty food. Burgers, fish, salads, sides and service.

This is an owner operated, chef driven, neighborhood gem that is loved by all the locals.

If you download the ItsOnMe app you can even buy someone a drink or gift card here right from your phone."}
{"text":"This was amazing!  It is more than worth the trip off he strip!  Best meal I had in Vegas. I can't even recommend one thing on the menu as we went with a group and everything we had was 5 star!  Server was fantastic (Stacey we  you). You were such a good sport with our more than roudy crowd. #butdidyoudie #toodle-pop motherf***ers #doyouknowmrchow"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when i go to Downtown.

The service is amazing, we got checked up on pretty often. We started with the pork rinds (idk if I'm spelling that right) which was pretty good. They have a nice selection of beer to."}
{"text":"What a find! This is a great spot to have a vibey delicious meal we were lucky enough to have Justin our waiter who was so knowledgeable about everything that we ate and truly loved his job what more can I say we will definitely be visiting and frequenting this very great restaurant when we're back in Las Vegas if you want something a little different from the normal scene I definitely recommend this joint great drinks great atmosphere perfect energy amazing food"}
{"text":"I had walked by the construction site for months and months and long anticipated the opening, an couldn't wait to try the food. I've been twice now, once for lunch with coworkers and again for lunch with my mom. Both times the food was so-so, (improvement the 2nd time around), but the service was just very very strange both times. I can only assume they are still working out opening kinks and finding their groove! 

On the first visit there were 5 of us, and there weren't enough plates or silverware at the table, and it took a reallllllyyyy long time to get someone's attention to get extra plates, even after our appetizers arrived, so we had to wait to eat them. There were also random french fries scattered around the chairs and floor from the people who had sat their prior to us, that we kept finding throughout the meal. It was hard to get water refills, or anything else we needed for that matter. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which was just SO bland. It was as if someone forgot the salt and seasoning entirely, and just put some diced chicken on a piece of wheat bread....really odd. Others said they liked the burger and panini, so perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. We did all enjoy the whipped ricotta appetizer. 

The next time I was there with my mom, service again was quite weird. The server kept bringing her extra sodas without asking if she wanted any more, and also before she had finished even half of the first one...and this happened twice. The entrees were dropped before our appetizer plate was cleared which is my biggest pet peeve, and then the bill was dropped not even 2 minutes after we had taken our first bite. 

I got the Togarashi chicken sandwich, which was much better than the chicken salad sandwich and quite large...and the side salad was great. My mom didn't care for the side salad because it was almost half chicory and/or fennel leaves which I happen to LOVE, but is super overpowering and can be a really unique taste for people who don't like it. I wonder if that was intentional or if the line cook got it confused with arugula... :P She really liked her panini as well, so we were both happy with our meals, but again- weird experience! It's definitely not a cheap lunch either, works out to about $20 pp. Am bound to go back due to the proximity to my office but not jumping at the chance..."}
{"text":"Great food, super unique flavorful food. Must try everything on the menu! Really friendly staff to top it off."}
{"text":"We received a very passionate PNW recommendation to come here for brunch on a recent visit to Vegas. Seeing that it was near the Fremont Experience, I was definitely interested in coming out for a Sunday brunch!

From our hotel on the main strip, it's about a $20 cab ride to this location. The restaurant is located on a corner and they have a few tables for outdoor seating. It was chilly (60s) with the sun out, so we ate inside. The venue reminded me very much of being in the PNW..with the dark wood floors, and brushed metal finishes on the furniture.

I ordered their benedict which arrives stacked high. Due to the chopped fresh tomatoes (not quite a pico de gallo, but close) my hollandaise was tepid. The eggs were solid, which bummed me out but I was hungry and the dish was otherwise tasty, I didn't complain. The portion was just tipping to overfull, which was a plus. 

I had read about how to order water while in Vegas, and here the server admitted that she didn't know if their tap was filtered or not, so we opted for a bottled Fiji and hot water (which has been boiled at least?). It was interesting. Service was otherwise attentive and patient. She chatted with us when we asked for recommendations on stuff to do while in the area. 

It was a nice start to our trip."}
{"text":"If I could eat here every day, I would. My goodness is this food stellar!
The service right through the door was great. Super friendly smiling staff were attentive all night. There was a live guitar player/singer for most of our meal which was nice. The ambiance and decor were great as well. 
We went around 8pm on a Saturday  night and it wasn't very busy. If you have a larger group, I'd definitely make a reservation. There is a decent amount of seating which is refreshing for a downtown restaurant.
I went there with a girlfriend and we sat at the chef's bar. Our waitress let us know that they have sort of a sharing concept there which is great for me because I want to try as many dishes as I can. 
We started with the pickled spring tomatoes. It came on top of whipped ricotta and served with fresh grilled bread. The bread melts in your mouth, the ricotta is perfectly creamy and the tomatoes burst in your mouth with flavor. It was outstanding!
For entrees, my friend ordered the Squid Ink Pasta which was lovely and they didn't shy on the crab meat at all.
I ordered Creekstone Farms Sirloin that was served on top of smoked chili whipped potatoes. Beautifully cooked and the flavor was spot on.
Finally, after seeing all the pictures on yelp of the desserts, we had to try one. We got the peach cobbler and man, was it good! It was served with a bourbon butterscotch sauce and ricotta & ginger ice cream. Amazing!!! We were able to watch the chefs make a batch right in front of us which is a plus.
They have a great brunch menu and I have to come back and try lunch and at least four other things on the dinner menu. 
You have to try this place! Carson kitchen took the cake last year for downtown eating, and Glutton is taking it this year."}
{"text":"When the Las Vegas skies decide to open up and shower the city with the tears of gambling losses, (there's a lot of them), my coworkers and I choose to leave the comforts of our hotel in search of some even more comforting food. Enter, Glutton. 

Upon entering Glutton you'll quickly settle into the casual vibe and it's hard to miss the wide open kitchen. I love open kitchens as you know that the food is most likely going to rock with an emphasis on cleanliness, showmanship and quality ingredients on display. Our seat at the bar with our server/bartender/city guide/wealth of knowledge/all around nice guy, Dean gave us a front row seat of the food flowing from the kitchen, crafty cocktails and the outside lightning strikes. 

We decided that sharing a bunch of plates was the way to go and jumped into several of the recommended dishes. The whipped ricotta with tomatoes and bread got the big wheels turning, but I'll instantly fast forward to my two highlights. The beef cheeks and the salmon. 

The beef cheeks were fall-apart tender, served over a bed of homemade gnocchi and kissed with a rich sauce that was beyond delicious. This dish could have been three times the size and I would have devoured it all. 

The salmon was one of the best pieces of salmon that I have ever tasted. I don't even remember how it was plated and it really doesn't matter as the salmon itself was absolutely ridiculous. The chef showed some serious technique on this hearty filet, which was extremely crispy (not burnt) on the exterior, but perfectly cooked to a juicy medium on the inside. We could have scrapped for the last bite but played nicely and each offered the final morsel to each other. True gentlemen I tell ya.

Thanks for a fantastic dinner and I'll definitely be back to see you next time I'm in town, Glutton."}
{"text":"Finally was able to give this place a try  

I started with a strawberry mimosa and the watermelon salad 

The salad was very fresh and light not heavy which was great :) my waitress was very friendly and also told me about the chef special 

I sat at the bar and the cooks were very friendly and we had a good convo 

I ordered it to go ....even though I didn't eat it in the restaurant it was VERY YUMMY and fresh as well its nice to go to a place with nice fresh ingredients 

I will course come back and explore more of the menu since I was there for brunch I know there menu changes and would love to check out more of what they have to offer"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim and we were wowed. Service was a little slow but they were supper busy so it was understandable. I had the St. Patricks Day special corned beef and cabbage on gnocchi. It blew my mind and I highly recommend this spot"}
{"text":"The shrimp dish and the fire roasted corn are not to be missed. Surprisingly great desert and a fantastic vibe round out this Resturant. Don't forget to try grapefruit beer it's awesome. Only reason this Resturant didn't get five stars is we had to send a dish back to the kitchen and the manager was a jerk about it."}
{"text":"Used to be local to Vegas and have always loved the downtown vibe.  Glutton plays right into that vibe.  Simple well prepared food done right.  Had a party of 16 for my boyfriend's birthday and the whole experience was great.  Great service, drinks, and atmosphere.  Love that the menu had a bit of everything and the cocktails were just as varied.  Well done glutton keep it up!!  Will definitely be back when we visit again."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and the easygoing, friendly staff.  Went for brunch and had a delicious breakfast sandwich.  Menu isn't huge but the food is fresh, innovative and good!"}
{"text":"We took a group of friends that come to Vegas often but had never been to Glutton. Every single one in our group said that they would come back here in a heartbeat. Try the burger...honestly one of the best burgers you will ever taste. But to only talk about the burger would be a complete disservice to the rest of their amazing food. Everything was great, the service was \"spot on\" and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Great experience. Everything was delicious! You have to try the miso corn and popcorn ice cream (not together). They are passionate about food and it shows."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite restaurants. I've been about three times now and have been impressed with each meal. Their \"small plates\" section is loaded with some gems. Ingredients like beets and brussel sprouts are common at many restaurants these days, but their spin on them makes them anything but boring. Roasted root vegetables were charred and tender and made even better with a poached egg on top.

House made pastas are always great, particularly the butternut squash agnolotti with celery root puree and black truffles. For a larger and more savory dish, the cavatelli and short rib is excellent. The hearty, beefy flavor is a perfect cold weather meal.

They change up their menu regularly. I appreciate that and the fact that they aren't afraid to experiment with dishes. One daily special recently was shrimp, grits and pork belly. The spiciness was mild, but had enough heat to enhance the bold flavors and pair nicely with the sweetness of the crispy yet succulent slab of pork. The only drawback was that there wasn't enough grits.

Desserts are strong too. The churros with hot chocolate was as good as expected. The apple cobbler had a doughy quality to it, but with the brown butter ice cream and butterscotch sauce... I still destroyed it. The best dessert I've had at Glutton is one that isn't on the menu. It's a chocolate croissant bread pudding topped with house made ice cream full of candy bar bits."}
{"text":"Absolutely a top three for brunch in Vegas.  
Jaime, server extraordinaire, and Dean, best bar manager in Vegas. They remembered us from our Feb visit and took such good care of us today! Everything was SO delish!

This place is so legit: the staff are fabulous, service great, food delectable and drinks delicious.

Foodwise, do yourself a solid and get the huevos rancheros or the short rib scramble - the chefs do things with that cut that are so good they might be illegal. But it's okay, since what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...."}
{"text":"Order the pickled tomatoes!!!! Seriously they should have named it something else.  I hate tomatoes. But my friend said its not that much. She was right 4 pickled cherry tomatoes with olive oil drizzled on top of some yummy ricotta cheese with a small side of bread. No seriously you get 3 small wedges of yummy bread on the side of this dip.  I think it's really crappy that we have to pay $2 for an extra side of bread.  Just give the right amount of bread in the first place.  There is too much yummy goodness left over just for the one side of bread even if you were like us and piled it on!

Dean is an awesome bartender! He made us some melon cucumber cocktails that were awesome!!! Then we had to ask our server how much they were, $12 and they are tiny martini style glasses. Seriously for Vegas strip prices they should be on the strip not around the corner from container park hidden. And our server Bryan was really nice and helpful. Not much of a talker but he was busy. He kept checking on us.  And they kept our water glasses filled. 

For our entrees my friend ordered the burger and I ordered the gnocchi. Bryan said the menu is set up to be shared. So I'm thinking ok at these prices you expect us to buy a bunch of items??? Yeah with one app 3 drinks and 2 entrees our bill was $85 before tip. So the gnocchi was ok, the meat was delish but the gnocchi its self was a bit chewy for my taste. The burger was delicious too and it came with fries. They really should state that on the menu. Because spending that much on a burger is beyond my scope. But this one was juicy and good with home made pickles!!! And the fries were awesome! 

There was some girl playing a guitar and singing.  The manager came and introduced himself. All in all if you can afford it come here ask Dean to make you a cocktail and order the pickled tomatoes and burger. Don't forget the extra bread!!!! 

I swear if the service wasn't so good and the food tasting awesome I'd demote you guys a star for charging me for more bread! Seriously 3 pieces isn't even an equal share for two people! Just double it up, please!!!"}
{"text":"Always a super friendly staff who is willing to give you the low down on everything on the menu. They're always changing around items per season so that's amazing. Love coming here for dinner and brunch!"}
{"text":"Bad service and the food isn't worth the price. Tried Glutton out for breakfast and wasn't satisfied. Coffee tasted very watery and our server seemed more attentive to tables with alcohol. Not sure if I'll be trying their lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever eaten.  Period.  I got it with bacon, which they chopped so it was disbursed across in every bite.  Soooo good!!!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends for their soft open day. I enjoyed everything that was on the menu. Personally the best for me was the half oven baked chicken & Lamb neck pasta. The pasta was perfect. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  My friend and I were traveling through Vegas on a road trip and decided to stop for an early lunch before hitting the road. The menu was scrumptious and it was really hard to decide but I went for a light bite with a watermelon salad and it couldn't have been better. It was juicy, fresh, herbaceous and so so pretty to look at. My friend decided on the peaches and cream waffle which was quite tasty as well. I just wish I had a bigger appetite and more time to sample the menu, definitely a treat!"}
{"text":"Food A+, service A+, atmosphere strong A. This place is set up for shared plates, we started off with half chicken and a sirloin and ordered the pork rinds and the pickled tomatoes with ricotta cheese. We had signature cocktails and fine wine. The star of the evening was the peach cobbler drizzled in bourbon butterscotch with ginger infused ice cream. Sounds expensive huh? Well it wasn't. This place has only been two months, so get there before the prices go up."}
{"text":"Excellent Flatbread and Japanese Corn, Mediocre Drinks, Undersized Portions, Excessively Noisy

Starting with the positives, the Japanese Corn, the flatbread, and the Peach Cobbler are all 5 star dishes.  Then again, when two appetizers and your dessert are the best things on the menu, that doesn't say much for your entrees.  

I went with a group of six people.  The service was good, but the overall noise level caused by the music (turned up to club level) was obnoxious.  I could barely hear my friend sitting right next to me.  Starting with the drinks, they are average at best.  The bacon drink was interesting at first, but quickly became overwhelming and gross the more you drank it.  As for the mule and the other drinks, they were just okay.  

In terms of the food, I we ordered the brussell spouts, the tuna, hamburgers, and the squid ink pasta.  The brussell spouts looked like cole slaw and wasn't good (Cleo and Radio City Pizza have much better brussell spouts, although I make better ones at home).  The tuna was insipid.  My friend asked me to taste it.  It tasted bland and stale, and lacked any freshness quality to it.  We sent it back.  The hamburger and fries were good.  

As for the squid ink pasta, for $25, you would expect more to the dish than a dollop of frozen crab meat and a handful of pasta.  Seriously, the overall food cost on the dish had to be $4.  As to the \"dungness crab,\" it was clearly frozen or old and had bits of shell in it.  The pasta was bland and too thick.  All in all, the dish is a fail.  

I would come back again for the peach cobbler, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Yummy tapas size, grab a bite plates of deliciousness kept coming out, and we could not have been happier! Love a social, food sharing kind of meal!

Of course, if you do not play well with others....you can order your own dam food!

We started with the brussel sprout salad. So many flavors in one smart little salad! Fennel, dill, kale, yogurt dressing. Yum! Other highlights were the gnocchi, steak, Oh...Oh....and the bacon-fig flatbread. YAAAAAASSSS!!!

We loved it! and were sad we did not save enough room for homemade peach cobbler....NEXT TIME!"}
{"text":"I think Dean is one of the best aspects of this restaurant. Not only is he passionate about the food and can describe it in very real terms anyone could understand, but he also can give an honest opinion about what should be ordered based upon what you like.  Now to the food. 

I think that the food overall was well prepared. The descriptions on the menu look great and are written in a way that you ask questions and definitely want to order so many dishes. But, the food itself when it got to the table was a bit underwhelming, I gave 4 stars because I think most of the food was technically sound but was missing dimension. My fiancé who is not a \"foodie\" just used the terms \"missing something wow.\" When I pushed she said the food lacked dimension. Texture was missing on the fried rice dish and the garganneli pasta dish. Maybe some crunchy veg versus cooked or pickled would have made it a better dish. In addition we generally like a dish with some more pop. General population says pop but to be specific it needs a bit more acid. The garganneli pasta should have had some vinegar. Maybe Banyuls or possibly apple cider but some vinegar. The rice dish just needed more pickled veggies and it would have been perfect. 

I was happy with the atmosphere and the food just think they could tighten it up. 

Good job downtown Vegas food."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is awesome. Infinitely better than any of the overpriced celebrity chef restaurants we ate at on the strip. 

The menu, at first, doesn't look like anything really special. But our server Justin was incredibly enthusiastic about the menu and made everything sound delicious. Justin was really the best server we had on our Vegas trip, FWIW. 

We started with the shaved brussel sprouts (awesome), wood roasted shrimp (awesome) and curried Ccauliflower (OK, but not my favorite) for the table. For the main course we tasted the garganelli, glutton fried rice and seafood of the day, which happened to be salmon 3 ways. Everything was delicious.

We were so impressed at that point that we ordered all 3 desserts off the menu, and we are a group that rarely, if ever, orders dessert. 

Glutton was really a refreshing break from all of the stuffy restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"It was a dark and stormy night. No, literally thunder, lighting and buckets of rain. I was soaked and wanting some comfort food to warm me up. Glutton, make me a believer.

... And boy did they. I love the look and feel of this place, like a 100-year-old East Coast speakeasy, but with windows? My friends and I sat at the bar right behind the open-air kitchen and began to order food and drinks. First off, the alcohol selection here is great, different styles of whiskey, gin, vodka and tequila. They have a great cocktail list as well, but I went with the 12-year-old Macallan, neat. 

We ate family style and loaded the bar with gorgeous plates of food...

- Pickled Tomatoes, with whipped ricotta, basil and grilled bread. The pickled tomatoes were amazing and the combo of ricotta smeared on grilled bread, killed it. 

- Curried Cauliflower, almond butter, cumin pickled shallots. The Cauliflower had great curry taste, but it was a tad over cooked. 

- Wood Roasted Shrimp with garlic bread, parsley salad, bacon scamp and butter. Perfectly cooked giant pieces of shrimp and bread. More tasty soft delicious carbs!

We also ordered Braised Beef Cheeks and Pan Roasted Salmon. The Beef cheeks were ridiculous, most likely made in some heaven sent out of this world device, because these were so tender and juicy that I had an \"out-of-cheek experience\", an absolute must try when coming to Glutton. The Salmon is most likely made in the same heavenly cooking device, flaky, moist and with that perfect hint of salt and citric acid. 

If you haven't tried Glutton, you'd better hurry, because their menus are strictly seasonal. Which is how every restaurant should try to be, it is unnatural to have all the foods all year long."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is good. The calamari salad is one of the best salads I've ever had. The tentacles are fried perfectly and the dressing is light, sweet & spicy. Must try. I wish the prices were a tad lower."}
{"text":"I'm being nice and rounding up to four stars, mainly because they worked with me and my lifestyle and provided excellent service. Basically we arrived downtown on a weeknight at 730pm. Parking was easy... We threw money in the meter and headed into the restaurant. 

The hostess greeted us with a smile. We asked her about the menu items and if anything could be made vegan. Yes, I know glutton is next to an all vegan restaurant... But I wasn't overly impressed with vegenation and their recent health grades... Plus We wanted something different:) the hostess asked our server Stacey and she came back with four different menu items that could be prepared vegan. We decided to sit down and give this place a try. 

The decor is very simple... Open ceiling and exposed ventilation systems... It had a very lofty, industrial feel. There was seating around the exposed kitchen which we loved and will probably use next time. Overall it has a great feel to it. 

The service was great. Stacey was extremely knowledgable about the menu and I felt very comfortable asking questions and ordering from her. Our water was never empty... And the table was always clean thanks to the busser.  

The menu is easy to navigate and isn't very large. However, it's eclectic and has something for everyone's taste:)
We ordered our cocktail and wine... Both were delicious. I'm not sure I've ever tried a mule that delicious... And my wine... The best 5$ cab I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the brown butter gnocchi. He said it was good. Listed under the large plates... It was definitely a large plate... With a very small portion. For 16$ I think he expected to be blown away, and he wasn't. I ordered the shaved Brussels sprouts prepared vegan and the cauliflower prepared vegan. Both dishes were listed under small plates... Both were pretty decent portions and priced accordingly. I will say that both dishes were lacking something... However when we combined them together... They complimented each other perfectly. I would definitely go back and order both together, but never separate. 

I would definitely go back and give this place another go. I am curious about the watermelon salad and the street corn... So next time... I'll be reviewing that!"}
{"text":"Glutton has a passion for food, and it shows.  I stopped in for lunch recently and that burger of theirs is the best I've had; the sharpness of the cheese plus the savory meat which is a combination of ground hamburger, ground chuck and ground sirloin, perfectly seasoned and offset with bread and butter pickles, cool lettuce and onion, and a soft, but not too bready, bun.  I'm looking forward to my next visit here, but the hard part will be venturing to try their other fine menu offerings with a burger that's top notch!"}
{"text":"This place is cool. If you wanna grab some good food and a few cocktails and chat with a friendly staff. I highly reccomend this place. I was sitting at the bar and felt like I knew everyone. Betty is the shit."}
{"text":"Stacey and the whole staff at Glutton were amazing.  I threw my wife's 50th birthday party for eighteen guests out on the back patio of Glutton on Saturday Oct 3rd, 2015, and everything was perfect.  With the very patient help from Stacey we figured out a drink and food menu together long distance (I am from California) working within my budget.  Upon arrive they were expecting us and everything was all set. A great selection of beer and wine plus amazing signature drinks. All the food was amazing with most people loving the watermelon salad and Ahi Tacos.  But there was some discussion as other thought the Brussel Sprout salad was best and others the Curried Cauliflower or the Flank steak with mushroom sauce.  There was one vegetarian  guest which I did not account for, but the staff at Glutton were very accomodating and made her an amazing mushroom pasta dish, she was very happy.  We seemed to have two very friendly and accommodating waitresses the whole time.  They were very friendly, accomodating and attentive, but not in our face at all.  Just super friendly and wanting to make sure everyone was happy - and we were.  I really can't say enough good things.  Thanks Glutton for helping make my wife's 50th an amazing night."}
{"text":"Its the best when you can tell that the chef or whoever designed the menu, has had training in some fancy high end cuisine but yet decides to make food for regular folk to stuff our gullets with.  If you like, rich, flavorful and yes, gluttonous food experience, this place is for you (us). I suggest trying out their brunch menu as well, and split a cinnamon roll while you do. But either way, make sure to bring a serious appetite, because this place is not at all dainty with their usage of extra rich (and and super tasty) Ingredients. Although somehow, they manage to balance that in a fresh and creative way."}
{"text":"Awesome little joint. The food was superb. Amazing drinks made by our bartender. Love this spot. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came this morning for a boozy brunch, post bachelor party. This place did not disappoint! The Glutton Mary was so damn good. The kimchi flavor carried through and the jumbo shrimp garnish was a treat. The food was great. Duck fat potatoes were so delicious. My only complaint is I ordered the baked tomato and eggs and found the tomato sauce too sweet. Other than that everyone else's meal was great quality and well made. (As a large party we tasted and shared to some extent) Also, try the Remington, great coffee flavored martini. 10/10 would go there again."}
{"text":"Glutton is new (only open 2 months as I write this). It's trendy. It has a great staff who, as they start working together, are getting the bugs out and working like a well oiled machine. They also just started their brunch menu, so they are working through that as well. It's a place you can people watch if you want to sit near the windows, or chef-watch if you want to view the open kitchen, or just chat with your party and your wait staff. But most important, it's about the awesome food. I would love to see Glutton become successful.

The only speed bump we had after our party of 6 was seated was a longer than expected wait for coffee, but it was worth the wait. The breakfast menu has a lot of interesting specialty items. But instead of focusing on one of the more elaborate breakfast specials, I had to fixate on the yeast pancakes. I make a lot of pancakes, but always baking power and/or buttermilk style, and I've wanted to make yeast pancakes. After having theirs, well, it'll be tough to go back. To accompany these, I ordered sides of bacon and the ultra-gravity exuding \"duck potatoes.\" Again, I was satisfied beyond expectation. The bacon was perfect and nicely seasoned. The duck potatoes are similar to the home fries I make, with red and green peppers included, and, well... duck fat! Everyone else was equally satisfied with their meal.  Refills for water, coffee, and tea came promptly and often. We were checked on frequently. The staff are a delight with whom to converse.

While I did not get to have anything here other than breakfast, I had earlier in the week discovered Glutton by doing a search on, of all things, poutine (because the group I was with love poutine). They have something called a mushroom poutine. Very intriguing.

Ironically, we came to Glutton because our first choice, eat., had a 45 minute wait. From our table, we could see people still waiting to be seated while we were enjoying our delicious meal. I hope - nay, expect - that the lines will grow here."}
{"text":"I've had Glutton on my list since before they opened, and was excited to give it a shot when a good friend of ours decided to celebrate his birthday here. We sat down with 15+ people and decided to order almost everything on the menu to share family style, which I highly recommend if you come here with a group. Some of the dishes are a bit smaller, and probably better for smaller groups, but everything is easily shareable.

To get started, there's a few items that I would say are definitely worth ordering...

Mushroom Poutine & Spicy Pork Rinds - Both of these happened to be on a HH menu when we arrived, so we started with them. The mushroom poutine is nice, crispy fries piled high with mushrooms and cheese. Tons of flavor, and good enough that I think our table finished a whole bowl before the entire party arrived. The Spicy Pork Rinds have like a Cheetos type flavor, but on steroids. There's a huge amount of cheddar flavor with a good hint of spiciness from the cayenne, and they are perfectly crunchy.

Shaved Brussel Sprouts - Maybe not exactly fitting to the name of the restaurant, but definitely worth checking out. If you're a fan of brussel sprouts, even in the slightest, you've got to order this. It's bright, fresh, delicious and has more flavor than you'd expect.

Japanese Street Corn - Yes, I'm mentioning this...and I'm really not a fan of corn. It's certainly nothing I would order on my own, but I'm glad someone at the table did. I love that it's cut off the cob, and that the flavors are bold. It's nicely charred with a hint of smokiness, and is probably some of the best corn I've eaten anywhere.

Other stand outs for small plates are the Buffalo Sweet Breads, Curried Cauliflower and the Chicken Live Mousse. There really wasn't anything that we didn't like, and I think we put in more than 1 order for a few of the smaller items.

Once you're done indulging on all the appetizers, here's a few things to try off their \"Large Plates\"...

Squid Ink Pasta - I was only able to try a little of this, but wow, it was good. There's a lot of flavor in the pasta, and I liked the addition of crab meat. It didn't have an overpowering seafood taste, and the addition of mint gave it a hint of freshness.

Brown Butter Gnocchi - Although I think the portion size is a little small for the $16 price tag, the flavor is nowhere near small. The braised pork cheek is incredibly tender, and would probably be a hit dish served on it's own. Gnocchi is traditional light, soft and pillowy texture that absorbs all the great flavors from the sauce.

Glutton Burger - Not the best, but easily one of my favorite burgers in town right now. It was a bit on the salty side, which may be intentional, but was otherwise seasoned very well. We ordered it medium rare of course, and it came out just right. One of the most unique things about this burger is the soft, kind of sweet bun they use. This burger is something you can't leave Glutton without trying in my opinion.

Other stand outs from the bigger plates were the Bacon & Fig Flatbread, and the Linguini Putanesca. Much like the smaller, starter plates though...there really wasn't anything that we didn't enjoy. 

Aside from the delicious food, the service was excellent also. Our party was pretty big and we had one main waitress who really handled everything extremely well. She was on top of everything from the get go, and didn't stop checking on us until the minute before we left.

In short, if you haven't been to Glutton yet, you're definitely missing out. As a whole, I think it's a great representation of the way Downtown LV is heading. I loved it, and absolutely can't wait to get back for brunch."}
{"text":"Had a date nite out here and really enjoyed the experience.  Sat at the counter and watched as the owner (Bradley) and his chefs prepared all the really good food.  They were friendly and talkative and both they and the staff made great suggestions.

Had the cheesy pork rinds (which was the only marginal thing we had) and the eggplant for starters (eggplant was great).  Then moved into the Ahi Tacos  (which were great) and the Calamari Fries (amazing) followed up by the evening special.

While just a tad on the pricey side, it was great to have good 'grownup' food and really enjoyed both the atmosphere and the staff attentiveness (thank you Justin)!

Would certainly recommend this to tourists and locals alike.  And it does not hurt that its close to the container park as well."}
{"text":"WE HAD THE VERY FIRST PEACH COBBLER TO ROLL OUT OF THE KITCHEN! hard to imagine we had room after the linguini and clams,the glutton burger,the sea bream fish AND the zuccini sandwich but we made it happen and were we very pleased my hats off to chef joe and bradley way to go guys looking forward to ALL your new foods!"}
{"text":"The story is long, the story is old...Rex meets girl, girl meets Rex, Rex likes girl's indoor plumbing, girl likes Rex's musky scent. Rex and girl fall madly in love until her the money ran out.  Rex had a love like this Downtown...but sadly it faded. Rex needed another love...and this love arrived with style, with class, with her own teeth...2 of them.  Rex swooned, Rex caressed, Rex laughed wildly, Rex made sweet love...Rex finally left the house to be with her. Her name was \"Hot Tonsils\" Kramer. Oh, she was peach of a gal...she felt like a rotting peach that sat in the sun too long. Rex's eyes are watering. 

To celebrate our love, Rexy, the king of sexy, arranged a wonderful date.  Sadly the dumpster behind Denny's was filled with two trash bags full of dogs blood and a man who looked like Neil Diamond.  He insisted he was Neil Diamond...but who hasn't done that.   Rex needed to improvise. Rex remembered a place he had seen catty corner to Eat. and next to the Container Park. Rex grabbed Hot Tonsils, quickly carved an out of office message on the back of a sleeping hobo and hustled to Glutton. 

Gluttony was a true revelation. The beautiful couple started with the Ahi Tuna tacos and the calamari fries. the tacos were terrific and beautifully seasoned, but the calamari fries were quite simply incredible. Each and every piece of calamari were incredibly tender and flavorful. Arguably the most tender calamari Rex has ever had. To heighten the experience the chef added crushed peanuts to add the needed crunch and a spicy aioli to add the heat and acid. It was perfectly balanced.

The next course was the \"larger plates\" but they are still meant to be shared.  Hot Tonsils wanted the Butternut Squash Agnolotti, Rexy Poo wanted the Cavatelli & Short Rib dish and we compromised on the Spaghetti Carbonara.  All three had house made pasta and all three pastas were dome brilliantly for each dish.  The Angolotti was soft and delicate, and the puree underneath was delicate but had good flavor. The Carbonara was outstanding, the poached egg ran out and mixed with the cheese to make a great sauce, and the shitake \"bacon\" was inventive and added to the dish tremendously. The real star of the round was the Cavatelli and Short Rib.  The short rib was fall apart tender and the sauce was intense. The strong beef flavor and additional herbs and flavors were beautiful. The cavatelli was dense and stood up well to the softness of the meat and the gravy. 

Lastly, Rex's lady wanted all 3 desserts, and Rex obliged. He saw that look of love in her eyes, and he knew if he ordered those dished, she would use the Hot Tonsils on Rex's most intimate of areas...Rex's ear lobe...oh the lobe of love! The jar of cake was good, but not great. Tasted like soft pudding and cream. Strong chocolate flavor. It was difficult to share and didn't have a needed crunch factor. The dish can be saved, but it needs to be presented differently for sharing. The second best was the apple crisp, and on the right day it could be Rex's favorite. The fruit was soft and flavorful and the crisp was sugary and warm and comforting. The star of the show, the meal and maybe of the entire Las Vegas dessert menu scene is the Caramel Corn Profiteroles. Of all of the desserts Rex has ordered over the years...this was the best hands down. The profiteroles were perfectly soft and light, but had a crispy exterior. The ice cream in the middle tasted like popcorn...seriously. No gimmick. No fancy chef trick. The ice cream tasted like popcorn. Incredible. 

Sadly Rex and Hot Tonsils were forced to part after a particularly randy session ended in two severely burned lobes and an itchy crotch.  Love isn't easy, but getting a great dinner downtown is. Great waitstaff. Amazing food. Just what downtown needed. Glutton should be a great success in an area that really needs it. Bravo."}
{"text":"My cousin and I found our way here one night after deciding that we could both go for a good burger. OMG! was this the right place to go, the ambiance was really great and the service was impeccable! and I have to admit that I have eaten my fair share of deep fried pork skins (hasn't everybody?) but these were actually some of the best I've had.
Not to mention the Kale salad was really tasty...and this is coming from someone who is NOT one of those tree hugging kale lovers, no offense to those of you who are. 
Finally, and by no means the least, the burger....succulent, juicy, seasoned just right, just one of the best darn burgers I have ever inhaled, lol. If you ever have the opportunity, check this place out."}
{"text":"The logo totally makes sense now that I've finally tried it! Totally practiced restraint when perusing the menu... My favorite dish so far? The pickled spring tomatoes! Something about that whipped ricotta did me in. I'm adding this spot to my DTLV rotation."}
{"text":"Ate here for Brunch this past Sunday and it was really, good.  We had a great server and the others who took care of water and such were also friendly and helpful.  The food was very, very good.  I had the Yeast Risen Pancakes, which were the best I've ever had without blueberries.  One of my friends had the Egg White Fritatta, which was looked like it included a Tomato Caprese Salad.  I'm getting that next time!   One of my friends had the Proper Breakfast Sandwich, which was huge and I don't know how he ate it all.  But it looked very good and he liked it.  And my other friend had the charcuterie panini.  And she loved it as well.  We all had different kinds of cider to drink as well.  The one drawback is the parking is street parking and you have to pay for it.  It is worth the $2 for an hour of good food though!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service - definitely recommend stopping by if you're visiting Fremont Street Experience."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good. I really did. But, If you ask me if I have a reservation when we are the first ones to walk into the business when you just opened the doors (yes, this happened)  and there's nobody in the place but the 4 of you  (with nobody else behind you)   -  I'm going to say we didn't get off on the right foot.  We have been here a total of 3 times at brunch only.  They open at 9a. (why?) The decor is nice and airy a bit tight and gets loud fast.  First, pancake, pancakes, pancakes. This is the only thing you can't miss. Always order them. They are the best. The rolls were top notch and didn't give me a sour dough stomach ache so that's a plus. You should order some to go because you will crave more later. Service sucks. Snobby (as in too good to be serving you attitude ) , not attentive and doesn't listen sums it up. Back to food -Amazing tomato egg in a skillet. Sounds funky but I've had it twice because it just works. My husband loved the duck fat potatoes. They smelled funky to me and I don't eat duck so.... The vibe? I felt like i was an intruder on someone else's party. Not part of the inside joke. Staff (on all 3 occasions) mull around the bar area and chat and are having fun never actually paying attention to us. Each time I needed something I had to hunt him or her down. At one point I got up and went to the bar asking for more water. Not sure why the attitude but doesn't make you feel welcome whatsoever. I wanted to go back to try dinner but my husband reminds me we feel like we did when we wanted to eat breakfast with the place empty; \"Do you have a reservation?\" which translates to, \"If you were the only customers all day we still don't want to serve you.\" Go if you if you love pancakes and if you can take feeling like the red headed step child."}
{"text":"Very misleading. It starts with their logo and name. You have a belly bursting out of a button shirt  and the word glutton, making you believe your going into a hearty meal. But this just wasn't the case. Instead what it was is essentially a tapas restaurant. The food was mediocre at best, but again misleading. The spicy pork rinds were anything but spicy. The flatbread was bland and soggy. The shrimp was chewy and definitely not worth the price of $15 since the serving is just three. The only thing that was very tasty was the Brussels sprouts salad, but again when I think of glutton, a vegetarian salad is not what I would think of. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice though. The big windows were great to people watch and the music in the background was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Originally, we were a bit put off by the small menu, but boy were we wrong! 
We ordered the chicken, burger, & churros. Every bite was delicious!

Our service was outstanding. Our server gave us suggestions and explained the details of the menu to us very well. 
Our food presentation was great and it tasted even better. The burger is flavored SO well and topped with their home-made American cheese. Amazing. The chicken is flattened and stuffed with a pepper/ham stuffing. It's got a great kick to it and is simply mouth-watering. 
As for the churros, they are cinnamon dipped and served with hot chocolate. We NEVER order dessert, but we saw another table with these and wanted to try them. They were perfect. Seriously, we finished the whole thing. 

We can't wait to go back to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"We were enroute to VegeNation when we spontaneously decided to try Glutton. So glad we did! Open kitchen, energetic staff, delicious food, and an ever-changing menu makes for a solid culinary experience! (Try the Ahi Tuna Tacos!)"}
{"text":"Good but was expecting more.  I had the crispy chicken sandwich and the mr. had the burger.  The burger was great and seasoned perfectly.  My sandwich was good but while we were watching them make our food they toasted the buns and left them on a cold top.  By the time they assembled the sandwiches the buns were cold.  I know that there is a reason why they do this, probably to save time when it's busy, but I like a warm bun on my burger/chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"We were trying to pick a spot to eat in the downtown Fremont Street area. We had another restaurant chosen but this restaurant was recommended to us by the other restaurant. We were so happy we found this nice little eclectic restaurant it has a very comfortable feeling inside and cozy is a good word, however it has been decorated with clean lines industrial look I like the fact that the chefs are out where you can see them cooking. I chose the butternut big plate dish which was pasta stuffed butternut squash and my son chose the fried chicken dish and my hubby chose the short ribs pasta super delicious and I would recommend it to any who come to Vegas this is a great eat!!
We splurged and shared dessert and got a caramel apple cobbler and the cake in a jar both yummy you won't go wrong by choosing to visit this restaurant thank you"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here. Food is soooo good! Cocktails are excellent and the staff is very friendly! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"4 stars for downtown LV
Solid happy hour deal. 
Ambiance: 3/5 casual, hipster.

Service: 1/5 Service was so disinterested that it was actually hilarious. I felt like the waitress was a reluctant host of a dinner party where a friend of a friend(me) showed up uninvited. Not openly rude but service was so reluctant it was actually hilarious
Food: Food solid, but not exceptional
-pickled tomatoes: 5/5 definitely the best dish of the night. whipped ricotta was surprisingly delightful. we clean off our plates completely.
-mushroom poutine. 3/5 could have been delicious but mushrooms were painfully salty
-squid ink pasta: 2/5 the most disappointing of the dishes. minimal crab, minimal flavor. 
-Japanese street corn: 3/5 solid
-bacon fig flat bread: 3/5 solidd"}
{"text":"I got the Korean taco special. It was awesome. Meat was tender. Perfect amount of kimchee. We also got the Carmel corn profiteroles with popcorn ice cream was delicious.  The service was spectacular. Our drinks were never empty."}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  Food was incredible and wait staff was friendly and fast.  Cocktails were great too.  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"This place is next to Vegenation and when I first went there, I also noticed Glutton and decided to one day give it a try. Friday was that day. My boyfriend and I dined here for the first time and so it is my civic duty to let you know exactly what I thought of this yummy little restaurant.

We came around 5pm or 6pm and upon arrival we were both greeted and seated immediately. They have these cool menus that are attached to clipboards; the first page contains their small plates, big plates, desserts, snacks, & special/food of the day while the second page displays a list of the alcoholic beverages they serve. We had two servers, I'm not sure which was our main one but I mainly recall the young lady with the colored hair because she was very helpful and super friendly! She was prepared to answer my question about some of the food on the menu and informed us that they also have brunch menu from 9am-3pm which, in her opinion, had way better food and so she went to retrieve a take home menu for me to look over with their brunch menu and their evening menu. I have to say, I will definitely be coming back to try some of the brunch food because they all just look so good! 

The other server, a brown hair young lady, vaguely comes to mind only because I remember she was nice, but she didn't stand out like the other girl, but she advised us to get big plates and that way my boyfriend and I could share because they come in big portions.... Don't do that. 

I ordered the Brown Butter Gnocchi from the Big Plate section and my boyfriend ordered the Ahi Tuna Flatbread from the small menu. Both were the same price, $16, but the Ahi Tuna Flatbread could have easily been mistaken for an appetizer because, although it did taste good (and a bit on the spicy side!) that is definitely not something that would fill up a grown man! My Brown Butter Gnocchi wasn't exactly a \"big portion\" at all, it was actually the perfect size for me.

Aside from that, I will definitely come back here and I do recommend it to you all. These little places are way better than those other food chains. They're different & unique and that alone is a reason to give it a try! I can't wait to come back for their brunch menu!"}
{"text":"The food, service and ambience were great. For starters we had the banana nut bread - it melts in your mouth. I had the Texas style breakfast (smoked sausage, grits, fried eggs and pico de gallo). My man had the chilaquiles and enjoyed that as well. Surprisingly not crowded for a Saturday morning. The coffee was on point and the wait staff was very attentive. Would love to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Loved our first visit to Glutton LV. Fantastic service and amazing food. Calamari fries and Caramel Corn profiteroles were our favorites. Curried cauliflower, orecchiette with pheasant sausage and Ahi tuna tacos were all fabulous."}
{"text":"Gluttony: my favorite deadly sin that rules my wooorrrrld!

The name of the restaurant is Glutton. The word in my mind conjures up images of rich, deep fried foods. Just a bunch of fatty-fat-fat goodness. But actually, the menu is creative, the food is freshly prepared in-house, and they incorporate those foods called vegetables into their dishes.

I lunched here with a friend on a weekday before noon. The restaurant was chill and not busy, especially considering how lunchtime was approaching. The Togarashi chicken sandwich called my name. The sandwich was comprised of fried slices of chicken, miso ailoi, and pickled vegetables -- so freaking delicious! It had a sweet and savory flavor to it that was irresistible. The burger also comes with a side of fries, which is a plus in my book because so many restaurants nowadays serve them separately -- talk about un-American.

The food may be great, but I felt rushed once our server, who was curt whenever she interacted with us, left the check on our table before we even took a bite of our food. The reasoning: she explained the restaurant provides patrons the opportunity to pay quickly if they're on a lunch break. 

I absolutely love the food here and would love to return, but I wasn't digging the service so much."}
{"text":"I wish that I could say that I'm exaggerating when I write the following review, however, I am not. Looking back, I see that our first warning of what to come was when the non welcoming hostess corrected us when we asked if they served breakfast, \"no, we serve brunch.\" From there we were sat at our soon to be table of dismay and frustration as we were overlooked by every single staff member there. At last, the bartender, who for whatever reason became our server came to take our drink order. Of which we each ordered alcoholic beverages that lacked flavor, with a hefty price tag to boot. The waters we ordered no where to be seen. Our server who was never to return, was no help in this matter. So we had to do the unfortunate thing of asking other servers for it... This took over 10 minutes as they forgot all about us even though our table was literally in the center of the room. By the time we received our water we had a good guess that refills would be out of the question. At last we put our meal orders in, by our new server whose blank stare really portrayed how happy she was to be there. I'd like to say this story ends happily, however, when everyone else at my table's food arrived mine was never to appear... As apparently she forgot to order mine and never checked up on us after the busser dropped the food off. If she had she might have noticed (doubtful) that clearly a plate was missing at the table. By this point as my group had begun to scarf their food down I no longer wanted to prolong our time there so when I did finally get her attention I asked her \"to cancel\" my order... If she even knew what it was that I had ordered to begin with. No apologies, but rather looked perturbed that I was bothering her. Our bill, as you can imagine, was not timely and was missing the drinks that we had ordered with our original server. Weird how he suddenly remembered us now that the drinks were missing and came back to our table with the second check and asked \"how was everything?\" Being in the service industry myself and having a degree in hospitality it is quite upsetting to go into a restaurant such as this and have absolutely no type of apologies or even sympathy toward the above circumstances that happened. I let him know of the terrible experience in which he said, \"it couldn't have been THAT bad!\" and took my check and charged us. To be honest, at this point, I was not looking for anything free (because that certainly didn't happen) but rather some sort of courtesy and understanding of just how miserable the experience was. If I could rate this with negative stars, I would. Unfortunately I have no other option but to put one undeserving star."}
{"text":"It is always a treat to eat at Glutton.  We had the Calamarie Fries as an app.  It was delicious.  Nice, flaky batter and an eel sauce to die for.  Dinner was some pasta with smoked chicken that was off the chain.  For desert I had two apple empenadas with ice cream, so ridiculously good.  So all in all, just eat here"}
{"text":"I guess my only complaint about \"avant garde\" dining is the cost. Dinner for 1 is gonna run you $25 with tax and tip factored in.  Totally worth it, but this is the current trend happening in Downtown LV.  

Glutton offers a menu of \"recreations\". Nothing you've never heard of, but everything features an original twist: not just \"truffle-oil fries\", instead, a heaping bowl of fresh-cut fries smothered in a mushroom/sherry reduction and melted cheese curd.\"

Glutton celebrates fattening fair.  Yes, a former whole new parade of comport foods to try, including a brown-butter gnocchi served with slow-cooked pork cheek.  It's just a little on the ridiculous side. I do not want a calorie count on this one.  When I eat this one, I imagine myself sitting on a porch in Sardinia. A masterful gourmet take on farm food.

All of the ingredients a super-fresh, too. The grill is right out and the open. As if the owner is saying, \"Look! We ain't reheating s**t from plastic bags here. Our chefs are cooking from scratch.\"

This is a very nice addition to the growing DT business district.  My only sadness comes with the gentrification of the area and the displacement of those who can't afford a $9 bowl of gourmet fries, however savory or delicious they may be. But such is life in the city.  

At any rate, I left Glutton with the taste of braised pork in my mouth and I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was unique but absolutely delicious with every bite. The service was incredible ...warm and friendly and others came around asking how our food experience was. Had the salmon and my partner had an amazing burger. The kale and Brussels sprout salad was to die for. Absolutely gluttonicious."}
{"text":"I had the special of the day which was a chicken hash sandwich on ciabatta with an egg.  It was phenomenal.  Lots of flavors that went well together.  Went again and took my family.  Had the calamari fries with sirachi mayo and it was the best calamari I have had ever"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try Glutton since it opened and just now was able to set a date to go. The whole experience was just that, something to remember and something I can't compare to anything. Not having a comparison, in my book, is AMAZING! The server was great, detailed and attentive - you can tell they wanted us to have a great experience. We sat at the chef's bar and watched them cook, another awesome factor, and then we order:
Cocktail- Desert Sunset - Best cocktail I've had in a long time in Vegas.
Food- Shaved brussel sprout sala, Japanese corn and Ahi Tuna Tacos. 
Dessert- Chocolate Bread Pudding
I recommend all, it tasted great!"}
{"text":"I am so glad to be living Downtown next to this new gem!    Not only was service amazing, but the food was all very good.   The bread and butter... Yummmm.  Everything we tried was truly amazing and fresh!  Just to name a few of my favorites. The spicy pork rinds, the Buffalo Style sweetbreads, apple Salad, Brown butter Gnoochi. This place is a must try when you are downtown.  This place is a must we you are downtown or if you live downtown.  They have a patio and I am sure they are going to have an amazing Sunday Brunch  selection. I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Holy . 
The burgers were delish! You cannot go wrong with the glutton burger. Although their Crispy chicken sandwich was SO flipping good. So. Please go. I promise you wont be disappointed. 
Our server was very sweet and full of energy! I love interactions like the one Mike gave us!

Oh!! And apparently they have secret menu items that they post on Instagram for lunch so I suggest you follow them on Instagram like I do now for those secret menu stuff!"}
{"text":"Glutton is a place to meet up with great friends and try a few menu items family style, which seems to be the trend nowadays, so that you are able to have a taste of multiple menu items
without filling up too quickly.

I met up with a bunch of super cool peeps for some dudes birthday and we had a glutton fest! I had a few things I wanted to try and immediately upon arrival, the Chicharrones and Mushroom Poutine were already on the table. I got a drink called the Pig Roast which sounded good on paper, but tastewise was not all that. I'm a liver lover...Calf's Liver, Foie Gras, Ankimo, etc. Glutton's Chicken Liver Mousse with Port Jam offers a rich delectable start paired with crisp grilled bread, great flavor and texture for sure.

 The Glutton Burger was another item on my hit list. Ordered medium rare, the cooks not only know their cooking temperatures here, but the seasoning was on point too. As other plates were passed among our table, I also managed to snag a bite of more deliciousness-Buffalo Sweetbreads, Gnocchi, Brussels Sprouts, Cheese Gougeres, Japanese Street Corn, and a forgettable pasta dish with crab. For dessert, we shared the Chocolate-Chocolate Chip Cookie Sandwich with Peanut Butter Ice Cream and Pretzel Dust which was a nice end to our dinner. 

Our waitress was great from start to finish with her team of servers delivering/bussing plates in a timely matter, drinks were filled quickly, and when it came for the bill, checks were split no problem(we had 15-20 people). Overall, great first visit and I can't wait to return for their weekend brunch!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Wow what an awesome restaurant!! When I first walked in this restaurant I knew it was going to be good based off the amazing smells. 
When we arrived we were quickly seated and the server promptly asked for our drink orders and brought them quickly. The menu was small but everything looked delicious. The server noted the burgers were the best thing on the menu and people come here just for the burgers so everyone at my table had to try one! Got it ordered medium well and substituted the side salad for the fries. After a short wait our food arrived and had great presentation sitting on a wooden cutting board. I anxiously took my first bite into my burger and WOWWWWW it was so juicy with incredible flavor!!! Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The side salad was made of arugula and tomatoes with a light dressing that complimented the burger very well. I would suggest getting this over the fries. 
Overall incredible food, fun atmosphere, great service, and good prices. There's nothing not to like about this place so make sure to check it out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the saving grace of DTLV. We ordered several items on the menu (Brussel sprouts, gnocchi, chicken) and everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. Their take on the mule is GENIUS! Best cocktail I've had in ages! The popcorn ice cream dessert was stunning! STUNNING!!! So good!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal I've had in Vegas outside of a casino. 

The gnocchi was amazing, as were the flatbread and profiteroles (topped with shredded popcorn!).

It's rare that I have nothing bad to say about a restaurant but I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant. 

I also loved the atmosphere and the customers it attracted. I felt like I was right back in New York."}
{"text":"One of my top picks and favorite places to eat downtown! Service with a smile, nice vibe/atmosphere, with over the top food! Highly recommend giving them an opportunity to serve you."}
{"text":"Gluttony comes so naturally in sin city, it's no wonder this place is packed during brunch. For some reason, I don't crave salad or yogurt or fresh fruit when I wake up in Vegas, but rather: cinnamon buns, cheesy omelets, and breakfast cocktails. It's weird. But I gotta go with it. 

Don't let the playful name fool you - Glutton has some serious chefs! They serve up totally decadent dishes with gourmet flair. I had the shrimp scampi omelet with crispy potatoes ($18). So good! Also, the zucchini \"muffin\" ($5) comes in a big buttery skillet. Divine. Prices are definitely high for brunch, but they know what weary party people are willing to pay for a carb-filled morning meal. 

Service was quick & friendly, and the ambiance has a casual diner feel. Another popular brunch spot (Eat) is just across the street, but I personally liked Glutton's menu & ambiance better. Check it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because the RJ said it was a great brunch place. They were wrong, it's an amazing food place. We had the Short Rib Scramble, Duck Confit Chilaquiles, and Apple Pie Waffles...everyone left happy.  This is a must visit place for all of our friends who visit Vegas - we'll be back often."}
{"text":"what an awesome little spot for an above-average meal!!! our first time here n sat at the bar, dean was our server (also the bar mgr) very friendly, and pleasant.  food was out fast, presentation was on-point and taste was AMAZINGGGGG!!!

we ordered:
-mahi tacos
-glutton burger n fries
-pickled tomatoes w/curried cauliflower
-shaved brussel sprout salad

highly recommend when downtown!! you will LOVE it!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast yesterday around 10 am with friends. We got the Benedict (3/5 - just fine), short rib scramble (4/5 - very flavorful and the toast was soft and amazing), mushroom omelette (3/5 - loved the goat cheese and mushrooms but the omelette was a bit hard) and the chilaquiles (3/5 - flavor was good but it was just so-so). Setup was nice and hip but it was kind of hard to flag down our server that time. It was an ok experience overall."}
{"text":"Great venue, great service, good food! Loved this little gem. The staff were knowledgable and the food was good. The highlight for us was the burger and the Brussels sprout salad."}
{"text":"This is a cool little spot for some good breakfast....I ordered the simple breakfast? It was executed well....eggs were cooked perfectly and the homemade sausage was good as well. My wife had the wild mushroom omelet and she enjoyed hers as well. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars because I would've liked to see some creativity and bolder flavors......something more then what I make at home.....overall breakfast done well"}
{"text":"I went to Glutton with my fiancé a few weeks ago to get some dessert. We ordered Peach Cobbler which was amazing!!! We are big foodies and enjoyed it so much!
The service was 10 out of 10 too!
We are going back there for sure to get some dinner next time."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaazing!  If you want quality, farm to table style food- look no further. And by the way-  the restaurant staff actually has personality and manners!!  Everyone was super nice, accommodating and professional.  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"I decided to come down and check out the Container Park area and recognized that Glutton was across the street from another place I have been to eat. I decided to go new as I usually will. Upon entering, I noticed I could sit at the bar overlooking the chef at work. My kind of place so far. The waitress came up and explained the menu and said the Benedict was her favorite. I decided to try it after reading the description - braised pork?? How can you go wrong there. Next chipotle hollandaise sauce???  Ok....let me give it a whirl. All I can say is Wow!  It was a great breakfast/brunch item. I definitely recommend it. 

Also, this downtown Vegas area is really starting to thrive with new restaurants and shops. Better make a point to check it out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We were going to go to Eat but it had a 40 minute wait. We walked across the street and were so happy we did! Sunday brunch has a cider and a mimosa special to go with their food. It's farm fresh food and not the fried gut bomb you get all around here. They have everything from a breakfast salad to a brisket scramble. The pulled pork benedict with a chipotle hollandaise was fantastic, as were the apple fritters. If you're looking for cocktails they have multiple options for that as well. 

The wait staff was also attentive and friendly, so do yourself a favor and try this place out."}
{"text":"This is hand down the best restaurant in the downtown area. We went for lunch and had the pickled tomatoes, crispy chicken sandwich and the smoked chicken pasta. All were amazing. Went back for dinner the next night and it was even better than lunch. Service is on point, cocktails are creative yet balanced!! If you are in the downtown area you must try this place."}
{"text":"Well I'd like to say that I had the opportunity to try this place. The name alone I was a bit apprehensive, had to take some convincing for me to come here. After some time I decided to come here and give it a try. 

Unfortunately tonight we were turned away at the door 45 minutes prior to closing. Awesome!! There were probably 15 people in the place, and I noticed a server taking an order, too. Great! Probably won't ever be coming back. If anyone is interested in going here probably should get here an hour before!"}
{"text":"Delicious food....Nice location. The only reason it is not getting 5 stars is because the portion size and the price. Ordered the steak which was $24 and when it came to the table it literally had 3 small cubes of steak. Not to mention it was really hard to chew and I ordered it medium. If they had a little bit better pricing, more menu choice and bigger portions this place would be perfect!! I recommended trying everything but the steak!!"}
{"text":"Our friend introduced us to Las Vegas old downtown, and it is changing a lot for the better!  We had a couple dining choices but we were intrigued by Glutton 1) for the name and 2) because my friend had never been here so we wanted to try something new for all of us.  We had a lovely table by the window and a young lady started singing and playing live music while we dined, which was a nice touch.  

Service was friendly and attentive.  We enjoyed each of our dishes: shrimp, and sweet Japanese corn, gnocchi and braised pork.  They were all very tasty and filling - we were all full and satisfied.  The place was hopping by around 7PM for dinner, and we appreciated the down-to-earth clientele and service.  

A very enjoyable dining experience!  Thank you, Glutton!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there over the summer.  We ordered several small plates and shared.  Everything was delicious.  Nice atmosphere.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"For Life Is Beautiful weekend, I was staying downtown and stumbled upon a promo where I had a free $10 gift card to Glutton. I went on Saturday and they were only serving brunch. My friendly waiter Justen had told me they had amazing burgers, and he'd check with the kitchen to see if they could make it. They could! So that's what I had. It was a tasty burger that came with a healthy portion of fries. It was a great meal, and Justen proved himself even cooler when he offered me some coffee as they were about to dump it out. Coffee is the way to my heart, my man, so thanks!"}
{"text":"Cool place to have a brunch. But a pretty pricy. If you pick and choose on the items with drinks and food you can leave around 30 dollars a person with out tip.  Was the good worth the price? I don't agree"}
{"text":"My friends and I love \"brunching\" it up on Sundays. We've been to a lot of places downtown in particular, and we agreed that Glutton was a place we'd definitely attend again. I had the breakfast sandwich (probably one of the best sandwiches I've had) and the atmosphere is pretty cool. They are definitely busy (but who isn't on a Sunday)? We still got seated pretty quickly and the cocktails were decent. The waitress was a bit overwhelmed (she forgot a couple of things), but our experience was still good overall. The location is in great walking distance to Fremont, Container Park, and other nearby locations if you want to get another drink or have a bite to eat later afterwards. The parking nearby is also pretty easy to find on the weekends and mostly free."}
{"text":"This is to the gentleman who didn't quite understand the buy a round for the kitchen. They bust their ass to make your food so the restaurant gives a way to say thank you! I'm sure this establishment doesn't need people like you!"}
{"text":"Glutton is a cute place in Downtown. My husband and I came here for a Sunday night dinner. The place was empty when we came in, so the place was quiet. The service here was phenomenal. Our server did an excellent job explaining the items on the menu. He went into such great detail that it made our mouth water when he described how the Barolo Wine Braise Beef cheek is made! However, the overall meal was okay. 

FOOD: We tried the following: 

Lamb Neck Gravy (whipped feta, almonds, mint and olive bread) - The lamb neck was tender, but the dish had a more vinegary & sour taste to it so only try it if you like this flavor. But when you add it to a piece of bread it balances out pretty well. 

Japanese Street Corn (w/ miso butter and chives): This was the best dish we tried! The miso butter on the corn was so tasty. The corn was perfectly cooked with a hint of burnt corn in it, which was delicious! I would come back here to try this again. 

Barolo Wine Braise Beef Cheek (w/ Yukon potato & horseradish puree, early fall vegetables and shave truffle): The beef cheek was tender, but only one side was tender and the other side was tough and chewy (lame). The potatoes and horseradish puree complimented the meat, but the puree lacked taste. There were bits of truffle on top, which we all can appreciate in any dish! 

Lobster Lasagna special: This special item was the worst thing on the menu and the most expensive. Maybe if we didn't have the lobster lasagna I wouldn' have given the place a 3-star. The lasagna barely had any lobster in it. The sauce was sweet, which I wish the server would've told us it was the dish was on the sweeter side. It didn't taste good at all. 

Apple Fried Pies w/ date & walnut compote, vanilla bean ice cream: I'm a sucker for apple pies. Then, when I heard the pies were fried - I was TOTALLY DOWN! This is was an excellent dessert. The pies were perfectly fried and the inside had fresh apples and caramel oozing out. It tasted amazing with the vanilla bean ice cream. I definitely recommend this dish! 

PRICE: This meal for two people was about $105 w/ tip. I think every item was reasonably priced since it's made from fresh ingredients that is locally grown. However, that Lobster Lasagna was too expensive for the lack of lobster and it did not taste good. 

SERVICE: Service was amazing. I really enjoyed the staff there. They took the time to tell us about the restaurant concept, their favorite dishes and even described the way the menu items is made. I really appreciate how our server was also funny and attentive to our needs. 

Overall, I give this place a 3-star for food, 5-star for service and 4-star for the price, so a 4-star for the entire experience. I recommend the Japanese street corn and fried apple pies. 

Happy Dining, 

J Tran"}
{"text":"So so good.... I wish they opened at 4.... I went on a first date with a guy... Had the gnocchi.... It was great... And Crystal our server was a pleasure....hostess on way out even asked what I ordered and if I enjoyed it!   I'll def be back.... Love supporting DTLV continues!!!!!"}
{"text":"Five of us gathered for a Friday night dinner at Glutton.  Chef Bradley Manchester cooked for the table and just sent out dishes from the fall menu he wanted us to try.  We got:

Cayenne and cheddar pork rinds
Eggplant caponata with goat cheese toast
Brandade Rangoon with salt cod
Guanciale flatbread
Shaved Brussels sprouts salad
Beet salad
Japanese street corn
Prime flank steak
Gnocchi with pork cheek
Short rib cavatelli
Butternut squash agnolotti
Wood roasted chicken
Turkey and guanciale meatballs
Grilled bread
Maple and mascarpone cheesecake
Churros and hot chocolate
Caramel apple fritters
Caramel corn profiteroles

This restaurant is well named for the food can make one become a glutton if the food here is not consumed sparingly instead of a large order like ours.  Execution of the dishes was excellent.  There was nothing from the list that I didn't think was great.

Standouts--the Japanese street corn is a must get.  The shaved Brussels sprouts salad was superb and all four desserts were very good.  The gnocchi with pork cheek was sublime!

Service was excellent with fresh share plates and silverware being brought.  For a newer restaurant in DTLV, this is a standout among the ones I've been to.  One caveat--we had the gnocchi but that is not on the fall menu.  If it returns to the menu during another season, it's a must get!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was good. 

A little disappointed in the pork skins.. Dry. 
Not much to hoot and holler about"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place certainly coming back! First, walk in and seated with our server Justen.  Let me tell you he was one of the best waiters I have ever had in my entire life! He was passionate about the food, great recommendations and also answered all of our questions with perfection.  We started with some drinks, I can not remember the name of my drink but it was a special cocktail with Tequila....it was amazing.  We had some apps including the Ricotta and tacos.  Which both mind blowing.  However, our friends ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli which we ended up ordering after we received the steak salad, we took 1 bite and it was awful (probably just a bad steak).  The manager came right over and asked what we would like instead.  She apologized and it came right out.  Overall it was a perfect experience, the price was right, and the service was above and beyond.  I def recommend this place for anyone going downtown looking for a good culinary experience."}
{"text":"This place is great. I went for lunch and the food was wonderful I had the watermelon salad. The variety on the menu has something for everyone and it's well prepared. It's right next to container park and the atmosphere and service is good. I plan to go back. I recommend it. It's moderately priced $$$."}
{"text":"Really liked this place...my husband and I both mentioned that it reminded us of a place in West LA we used to walk to by our house (+1 star for nostalgia).
Downtown has grown a ton (in coolness/gentrification) in the last couple years. We went to eat soon after it opened, and it felt like it was an outpost of hipster in the middle of rundown weekly motels. But now...glutton, vegenation, poboys on one corner, John E Carson hotel on another corner, eat on the 3rd corner, and the container park on the 4th! Just waiting for a whole foods to move in down the street!
Anyway, Glutton fits in perfectly with the vibe of those other joints, and has really good food and drink to boot.
The inside is semi-industrial, with lots of windows to look out on an empty lot (haha - growth for the future! And there's lots of pedestrians these days, too!!).
We started off with drinks after our friendly server informed us it was happy hour: 4:30-6:30 (not sure the days - it's definitely on on Wednesdays), 2 for 1 beers, wines, or well drinks. Yay! Glutton has a pretty cool, though not extensive, beer list. Probably about 15 selections, including some in big bottles. Wine list looked pretty good, too. But the cocktails! We sampled the 'merica and the whiskey one (shoot, I forgot the name). Both were really good - love me some gourmet cocktails.
For food we had:
Japanese Street Corn - my favorite dish of the evening. Served with furikake and butter, I think. So good.
Brussels Sprouts Salad - with fennel. loved this one, too. It was more salad-y than Brussels sprout-y, and was a good complement to the other dishes.
Cauliflower - very curry, but I surprisingly loved them. Even my 2 year old loved them!
The steak - served with a little bit of creamy delicious mashed potatoes and some avocado/jalapeno topping. I am not a big fan of avocado, but I loved this little salsa. It added a creamy-spicy-sweetness to the meat. Very good.
Woodfired shrimp - Good shrimp, but kinda standard.
Half chicken - I did not try it, but my dining companion stated it was excellent.
Wish we would have tried the pickled tomatoes!

For 5 adults, 2 kids, with drinks - $150. I think that's pretty reasonable.

Added points for having a woman in playing guitar and singing on a Wednesday!

The only problem is, there are so many great places downtown, that I'm not sure when I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Boozy Brunch? Count me in. Glutton is an excellent choice for weekend cocktails and grub. Located in a beautiful space on the corner of Carson and 6th, which appears to have become a hotspot for eating downtown, I was surprised there weren't more people taking advantage of the recently launched weekend brunch promotion. 

Dyanna and I ate at Glutton on a Saturday morning. For part of our visit, we were the only customers there. I could see a group of people waiting to be seated at another eatery across the street and almost felt sorry for them, clearly they had no idea what they were missing at Glutton. 

The service we received was excellent, as one would expect from an almost-empty restaurant. I started off with the Morningshade, a chilled coffee drink with tequila, cinnamon, vanilla and orange ... Very reminiscent of a Mexican coffee, I couldn't taste any tequila at all in this easy to drink concoction. 

I love a good waffle, so I was unable to pass up the special for the day, a Peaches and Cream waffle. Perfectly cooked and topped with delicately sliced, delicious peaches, a mound of whipped cream and a very generous drizzling of bourbon syrup.  

I don't go downtown often, but the delicious weekend brunch offered up at Glutton is going to be hard for me to stay away from."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything was so good - whipped sweet pea ricotta, pickled mushroom poutine, lamb crepinette - but the desserts were unreal - rice pudding arancini!"}
{"text":"Simply...not impressed, and certainly not for the money spent. 

Came in for Sunday brunch and left incredibly disappointed. First off the hostess could use a hug, because she was certainly less than pleasant. Smile, chick it won't hurt I promise. The waiter on the other hand did greet with a smile and was easy to interact with and was really the only reason why I stayed after initial glance at the menu as I thought of going next door to vegenation. $14 for a chicken salad sandwich and fries? And certainly nothing stands out in that salad, as it was tasteless. $11 for an egg white frittata that wasn't bad but was a bit on the small side for the price. And that gigantic $5 cinnamon roll, you can pass on that if you were wondering. Seemed almost day old with the putter layer being hard (almost stale like). Obviously if I left 80% of it still on the plate, something is wrong with it. After tip...$39/ brunch drinking waters and the meal was uneventful to my taste buds. To top it off, the temperature control should be turned down a bit. I was uncomfortably sweating while eating. 

In the end, I simply find it a tad spendy for the quality of food and portions."}
{"text":"I really, really, really wanted to like this place but I'm afraid that my very first visit will also most likely be my last. Glutton is cute and has a good concept, but the service is spotty, the food is overpriced, and nothing tasted very good. 

The two of us ordered 1 diet soda, 1 specialty cocktail, an order of pork rinds, an order of wood fired shrimp, an order of cauliflower and the shaved brussels sprouts salad. Our bill was close to $70 with tax and tip! That is too expensive no matter how you slice it. The portion sizes are very small too (the shrimp dish had THREE shrimp for $15.00!!), so small that we ended up having to hit Fatburger because we got hungry again a few hours later. 

The food was just okay. The brussels sprouts salad was the standout. It was pretty amazing and would be the only reason I would consider returning to Glutton. The shrimp was good but not worth $15. The cauliflower tasted like something I could get at any restaurant anywhere, and the pork rinds were so gross that we ate a couple and stopped. The \"Pig Roast\" specialty cocktail was one of the most disgusting things I have ever put in my mouth.

The atmosphere is hipster and sparse, and I really enjoyed the truly open kitchen. The service was really sloppy. First, the entire concept of the menu was utterly confusing. Was it family style? Small plates? What was flatbread and what wasn't? Our server was less than helpful. Nothing on the menu was printed to give any sort of guidance. It was annoying and slightly obnoxious. 

There's also an item on the small menu where you can pay $5 to \"buy a round\" for the kitchen staff. Are you freaking kidding me? This seems like such a desperate attempt to be cool and different that it annoyed the mess out of me!

Our server wasn't the most pleasant person either, and she constantly forgot to bring drink refills, silverware, etc. She offered zero advice even when asked. I also thought a lot of the staff looked sloppy. 

I'm not a professional food critic but I love to eat and love experimenting with new flavors and dishes. Unfortunately, Glutton failed on pretty much every level. Maybe I went on an off night or perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes, but I am in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"Ambience is casual with fine dining prices. First off, the food was delicious. Everything I had from the appetizer, our entrees and desserts were all tasty. My only concern was the ridiculously small dishes that were over priced. My bf and I ate at a bunch of awesome fine dining restaurants on the strip that were almost the same price and we left full and satisfied.  At Glutton, you get Costco sample sizes, you def get fine dining flavor which was on point, not so much of the experience. It was very much of a tease. Very disappointed. We were so hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place before until I went here for my friend's birthday dinner this past weekend and I got to say I dig this place!  The staff was tremendously accommodating to our large dinner party and very friendly.  Our server did forget a drink here and there but usually that's to be expected with larger groups.  This restaurant is tucked away behind the Container Park next to Donut Bar and VegeNation in downtown Las Vegas.  The restaurant itself is on the smaller side, but I really liked the vibe of this place.  It had the neighborhood bar vibe going on.  The staff was gracious enough to bring my friend out a free dessert with a candle on it for her birthday too!

My friend and I shared:
-Calamari Fries ($15) - Delicious, the calamari kind of looked like chicken tenders.  The calamari was served with sriracha mayo, eel sauce, and peanuts on top.  This is considered a small plate, but honestly you can eat this as your meal and be satisfied. 
-Glutton Burger ($14) - Your classic burger but done right.  Served with pickles, onions, American cheese and buttery toasty buns, probably one of the better burgers I've had.  Served with a side of fries sprinkled with rosemary on top. 

I genuinely liked this place.  I can see myself coming here again for dinner if I want to eat somewhere nicer before spending time downtown."}
{"text":"2nd time at the Glutton. This place is definitely top 3 favorite places to eat. We enjoyed their amazing appetizers including cauliflower and corn dishes that are to die for. The hamburgers and fries were awesome. They really know how to cook the perfect fry. For dessert we had popcorn profiteroles and they are unlike any dessert you'll have anywhere else. A truly wonderful and unique experience. Our server, Justen, loves his job, the food, and taking care of customers."}
{"text":"Stacy, the manager, is da bomb. She will do anything in her power to make you comfortable and happy. The food is beyond expectation, so delicious.  Drinks are amazing as well. If you pass this place up, then you are stupid. Go here!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch there. Started off with the most amazing Bloody Mary, which is almost a meal in itself. Then had pork eggs Benedict- the flavors were amazing and beautiful presentation. Also tried the chilaquiles, done to perfection with a duck confetti leg. Everything is house made and exceptional. Serve was great. Jade took wonderful care of our table. Make sure to ask for her when you go there to eat. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Best food I have had in a long time. And the cocktail drinks were superb. More than anything the vibe and the people that work there were so attentive and friendly. This place will not disappoint in any fashion. A must for a casual meal or a date night. I went on a corporate happy hour event and was still blown away. And I rarely ever review a place unless it is really good or really bad. And this place was unreal. Unreal. Check it out when you get a chance."}
{"text":"Great food and an amazing staff.  Every single person who helped us was informative, eager to help, friendly, and overall just really chill and down to earth.  This was the friendliest and best quality service I've had in a long time!  Can't wait to come back and try out more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and had a great experience both times.  The first time, a friend and I tried to go to Carson Kitchen but there was a looooong wait, so we wandered around and found this place.  We shared the shrimp scampi, watermelon salad and poutine.  The shrimp was served on top of garlic bread which was delish.  There were flowers in the watermelon salad, which we both thought was strange... but it wasn't bad! The best part by far was the poutine, but be warned it is so rich- two people could share it and be full. 

Second time around we came for lunch, and had the Japanese street corn and charcuterie sandwich.  The street corn was so buttery and good.  Pretty sure you could order that for an entrée and not be hungry for awhile.   

The menu changes quite a bit, so these dishes may or may not still be available.  Food quality was great both times though, so it's worth the risk of trying new things!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! The portions, however, are small. There were two of us and we ordered three things. It wasn't very filling. For example we ordered the gnocchi dish for around $10-$12 and I think it came with 6 gnocchis that were super small! We looked around and the other people in the restaurants meals looked huge! Looks like the burger and chicken dinners are pretty good sized for an individual, we'll probably do that next time. Otherwise it was a great experience! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying how much I dislike their logo and their name. To the point that although I am always excited about checking out downtown restaurants but could not get around the damn logo! Geez, why the over bursting belly, yo?

Anyway, one evening a bunch of friends and I were on the Easteide of town and wanted to come to the DTLV. None of us had ever been to Glutton but we'd all heard good things. We decided to give it a chance. We started out with their pork rinds. They were fine, like very light, airy chicharrones but not incredibly flavorful. I chose a cocktail with gin and Aquavit in it, it was very strong and not really my taste although it was my first time trying Aquavit. A couple of us ordered that night's special, the cioppino. The cioppino was so, so good! It had nice and rich flavor and was hearty and light at the same time and perfect. 

I have since returned and had their burger with wine for dinner, and that is literally a slice of heaven. Their burgers are so frickin' good I can't even... Seriously, the beef is wonderful quality, they cook it to perfection, I mean, juices everywhere. It's glorious. Pair it with an inexpensive red and you are all set. Seriously, I should head over there now. 

I am looking forward to trying their brunch, they have that cute little patio in the back and I should go before it gets hot."}
{"text":"I thought it was a nice place to eat if you are downtown Las Vegas. The service was really great and I had a burger that was spot on! Its located across from the container park and I really think its the only place I would eat in that area. They have done a good job in upgrading the entire neighborhood and Glutton will be my go to place in the afternoon and evenings."}
{"text":"With a name like Glutton- you'd think there be an array of dishes, with much to eat. It's kind of ironic. Smaller portions and if you can read the menu you're pretty much amazing. I had no idea what anything was and the menu items were so confusing and weird.. This guy started to explain this complex menu to me and it went like this..\"it's a Brazilian chicken, glazed in a marinated zukini sauce, plucked, tanned and drowned in our gourmet Basil sauce, broiled, steamed and powdered in our finisher cocktail.\" Me: ok and the fish? Waiter: a fine dine flounder straight out of New Zealand , flew over this morning.\" He said is something wrong? I couldn't stop laughing..I said just bring me a glass of moscato and some good ass pasta  we literally had egg foo young and chicken noodle soup- but with fancy titles to uo the cost. Food wasn't bad- but I mean..."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. To start off, the service, the waiter, was phenomenal, excitedly shared the specials, and every other sever was just as friendly to include the very accommodating hostess. We stared the Watermelon Salad from the small plates section of the menu. By the way, the small plates are small, appetizer size, the big plates are enough for one. Great taste, appropriate for summer and tasty. Next up was a Ribeye Steak pan seared and then slow cooked. A perfect example of what a ribeye is like, tasty! Followed up with dessert, Peach Cobbler, warm, soft and chewy served with vanilla ice cream. I now feel so full, no wonder they call it Glutton!"}
{"text":"There's been a pretty radical transformation in Old Vegas the past few years.  What used to be a super sketchy patch of town has turned itself into a pretty amazing pocket of cool shops and amazing places to eat!  Glutton is the jam!  Really killer drinks and everything we ate was just awesome.  The people that ran the restaurant we're hanging and talking with us while we had drinks so we got to get a pretty good feel for the vibe of the place.  We're definitely coming back.  The tomato appetizer with the ricotta and their homemade bread was just fucking awesome.  Do it.  We shared the burger & the fried chicken sandwich (which has a bahn mi take on it) because we wanted to try a couple things... Goddamn.  That's all.  Goddamn.  Top all time burgers and fried chicken sandwich with a bahn mi take on it EVER!  Burger was drippy in the most best was possible.  Homemade American chee?!  Okay.  That's all.  Just come eat here and high five some super cool people making killer grub... Over and out!"}
{"text":"The food and staff was amazing!!!! We will be back for there brunch the menu looked just as tasty as there dinner menu. The must try's are pork skins perfectly seasoned and the peach cobbler!!! Honestly had a hard time walking out after everything I ate!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Food was very good,  Smaller portions but the taste was 5 Star.  I had a chicken/pasta dish and the pasta is homemade.  So good I would have liked a few more bites. LOL"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and really enjoyed it's easy atmosphere. Not a place that is at all pretentious or \"done up\", but certainly an establishment that's able to provide you with interesting, though not necessarily exotic, culinary offerings served in a pleasant, bright and charming atmosphere. 
Loved my bartender Evan, he shared with me one of his mixed inventions: a drink called EvansColor(s). I was most fascinated by the pride his co-workers expressed simply knowing that I was about to indulge myself with this tasty drink. 
I had these really satisfying truffles and this lamb crepinette. Never heard of a crepinette, but now that I've tasted one, I'll be back for another. 
Quite a few other dishes I'm curious to try and the staff working there really made me feel like I wanna come back and spend time allowing them to play host while I play patron. 
Glutton is the kind of place you'll make your \"go to\" hang because it's just so easy to enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent menu with handcrafted high quality food! Also love the space - open and refreshing. 

Has a little back patio if you want some nice sunshine.

The service was great! 

A great addition to downtown.Perfect for business lunch!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first today! Great food. Great service. Stacy our server was well informed of the menu and options. I had the steak fritas. The steak was super delicious and the sauce was great. 

If your in downtown Las Vegas then check this place.
It's on 7th and Carsen."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the continual transformation of the downtown LV area, especially all of the growing number of unique restaurant options.  So next up on the list was Glutton and must say we really enjoyed!  Although not a Brussels sprout fan we started with the shaved brussel and kale salad which was awesome. This place is tapas style and is great for those that like to try lots of things and share. Everything we had was excellent and service was great so definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"New American tapas style plates, semi-innovative and about $10/plate. I like the open kitchen, farm to table concept and the service was impeccable! Highlight for me was the desert- popcorn caramel profiteroles!!! Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"It's a very smart idea to open a brunch place across from somewhere that has lengthy wait times.. spill over is a great way to do business for brunch. At least that's how I ended up here and happily so.

Saturday morning at 11am and no wait. Place had a good steady stream of customers. Our server was very helpful and nice albeit it took longer for our food to come out compared to other patrons.

I had their French Toast which was tasty but could have used a lot more of their \"salted caramel\" flavor. Also it's just a plate of 4 slices of toast-- would've like maybe 2 slices of toast with a side of protein and fruit.. just my suggestion. I DID get a side of sausage which was delicious. My husband got their eggs benedict which has a Southwest style take on it. Was very tasty!

Next time I'll have to remember to request to sit on their back patio."}
{"text":"I am a glutton for Glutton! We enjoyed our entire experience from food to service.
The execution and attention to detail is what really sets this Downtown eatery apart from the others. The corner location feels like NYC. We were surprised they weren't as busy as some other nearby places that aren't as good.

Thank you Jade for your most attentive service, we look forward to coming back. Keep up the great job Chef!

Food:
Shaved Brussel Sprouts-fresh, crunchy with right amount of tahini dressing and nutty bits of Parmesan. I would probably take a Beano beforehand because raw Brussel sprouts :)

Pickled Tomatoes - whipped ricotta made by little cherubs. The bright cool tomatoes pop in your mouth and compliments the creamy ricotta. This tastes like the definition of farm to table.

Curried Cauliflower - again the attention to detail with the curry sauce on cauliflower with almond butter & pickled shallots. Would love to have this served with garlic naan bread.

Singaporean Chili Crab - King crab legs with a slightly spicy, tangy tomato sauce accented by strands of chili threads served with toast. It's easy to eat and savor every delicious bite. I've been lusting after SCC ever since seeing it on Unique Eats. Chef said they may even add it to their regular menu items.

Ahi Tuna Tacos - fresh, crisp, light yuzu guacamole and just really good.

Raviolo - perfect single ravioli with oozy egg yolk in the middle that mixes with the brown butter to give you a more decadent sauce."}
{"text":"Great service.   Wonderful presentation of food.  All the food had amazing texture and was very well-cooked.   The problem with the restaurant is the actual taste of the food. Everything, and I mean everything, tasted salty. The bread was salty, the pork cheek with gnocchi was salty, the burger was salty, the french fries were salty and even the linguini and clams was salty.  I think it's a correctable issue and sure hope the restaurant adjusts its use of salt and/or salty foods because if they do, I think it will become a great spot to eat at."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined here for a lunch break on a week day a couple weeks ago. I'd been meaning to go ever since I saw their sign go up on Carson, and they weren't even open yet.

The inside has the same vibe a lot of restaurants in DTLV have currently. Concrete floors, open ceilings, a bar, snazzy little plates, and hardware, etc. All the stuff you would expect from a trendy Downtown place. Luckily the place has better acoustics than Carson Kitchen, because while my friend and I were there during a lunch rush we could actually have a conversation with each other without yelling.

As for the food, I ordered the Linguini Putanessca, which was FABulous. The spaghetti itself was so amazingly fresh. The sauce was also rich, with a nice tang from the capers. The crispy porchetta rinds add a much needed *different* layer to the pasta.

Unfortunately, I was still hungry after I left. The portion was small -- even for lunch. I wish they would add just a bit more spaghetti to the dish, and it would also be nice of them to serve the pasta with a crusty garlic bread of some type as well. 

Service was abrupt and kind of cold. Not sure if our server was having a bad day or what, but she was not very congenial and brought out our bill pretty hastily.

Overall, I ding the service (which can obviously vary), but also the portion sizes. Please trendy restaurants, just a little more food and you will make me a very happy camper who will return again and again."}
{"text":"This is such a great little spot. We've walked by so many times on the way to Donut Bar and kept saying we should try that place. I'm so glad we finally did! Everything was really clean and bright. There is table seating, seats at the bar, and seats at the kitchen where you can watch them cook. All the servers were extremely hospitable.

We split the Grape Salad and the Garganelli Pasta ($45 with a glass of wine and an iced tea). The pasta was great. You could really tell that the ingredients were super fresh, even the house made pasta! The salad was OK, too, but I was hugely disappointed because the description said it came with a maple vinaigrette which I was excited about...but I couldn't taste anything over the edible flowers which I hate and which were not in the description.  Honestly, the salad was my only complaint.

We had planned on stopping back in before they closed to try their fried rice, but they had closed early because they were slow. Maybe call 1st if you're planning on stopping by later.

UPDATE: We stopped in 3 days later for the rice. Delicious. Great flavor. Big chunks of short ribs. Meat was tender. So good. Also, the staff was so nice while I was waiting for my rice, I gave them back their other star.

We're definitely heading back to try some other dishes like the Japanese Street Corn, the Fried Rice, and the Glutton Burger!"}
{"text":"On a corner of downtown Las Vegas, in an area that is surrounded with good food, Glutton holds its own.
A group of us went for lunch on a weekday and without reservations were seated right away.
We ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos as an appetizer, four to an order so that was one for each of us. The shell of the taco was over cooked but the tuna was fresh and tasty.
Collectively as a table we ordered: The Glutton Burger, The Crispy Chicken Sandwich, Huevos Rancheros, and the Garganelli.
The Garganelli and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich were the favorites at the table. The Huevos Rancheros was the least favorite, and most of it was still on the plate when they cleared the table.
Next time, I will come for dinner. I wanted to try the flat bread, and wood roasted shrimp, which aren't on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Really good food! Cool atmosphere with a very nice, friendly, and helpful staff. Will be back thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"The banana bread, flavored mimosas and brunch dishes (Short-rib Scramble, Texas-style and Proper Breakfast Sandwich) are excellent and the staff is great. There was no waiting at noon on Sunday."}
{"text":"Please read my first review for more food choices. 

Back for the second time at Glutton to try the Boozy Brunch, and wanted to speak my mind. I really was not happy with my food this time, so I was prepared to lower my rating. 

The service was great, don't get me wrong.  Kayla was on top of filling my water with a warm, friendly smile.  I liked our waiter Justin, he was friendly and attentive. However, I was not happy with his suggestion of the breakfast sandwich 3/5. 
The duck fat potatoes 2/5 were dry to me. I expected them to be more rich and flavorful  than normal, but I was very disappointed. The bread was amazing on my sandwich, but I did not enjoy the sausage patty. It had too much herbs, and felt like I was eating a veggie burger where they were trying to hide the taste of the meat instead of enhance it. I halved it with my friend, and she complained about the exact same thing. It just wasn't good. I should have gotten the chicken salad sandwich, like my first instinct. 
We got the ricotta spread 5/5, and again, it did not disappoint. This is probably one of my favs on the menu. 

Ok...so just when I had made up my mind to downgrade this place to a 3...Dean - saved the day! He was the bartender. We just happen to be sitting right next to the bar. He kinda mosied over and started to speak casually to our table. I guiltily admitted I overheard him creating a new drink and sharing it with the staff.  I asked him about the liquor he put in it. He immediately brought the bottle over and showed us. He started explaining about this aloe Vera liquor. He brought along a shot glass and gave us a taste. He then shared so much knowledge with this liquor and many others. He was so impressive with the amount he knew about his alcohol. He even let us taste his new sage drink. I will not share the name, to keep the haters from stealing it, as it was very clever.  The drink was also delicious!

Then at his suggestion, we decided to try the watermelon salad 5/5, as I was still hungry since I didn't eat my food. It was amazing!!  It was so light and refreshing. Now this is 5 star food!!!

Management, wherever you stole Dean from, keep him!!  He was so friendly, and so knowledgeable, I want to come back just to have more drinks by him. I was so prepared to lower my review until he came over and made my whole brunch better. 

When you come, be sure to ask for him, ask his suggestion for a drink, and tell him I told you so. Pick his brain...you will be amazed too!!!!

I'll be back!!! :D"}
{"text":"Normally, this isn't my type of restaurant but I went with a friend who wanted to go.  Because most of the menu options didn't appeal to me, no fault of Glutton's, I chose the hamburger.  I never order hamburgers in restaurants but my friend said it's their speciality.  This was, hands down, one of the best burgers I've ever had.  It was perfectly cooked and the bun couldn't have been better.  Our waitress was awesome and could even tell which was the diet vs the regular coke just by looking at it ;)  Call me easily impressed but we both got a kick out of that.  Had a relaxed atmosphere but not sure it's a kid place, simply because the menu is a bit more trendy, but they may have a kid's menu I just didn't see."}
{"text":"First I want to say that the menu was limited so I ordered the Eggs rancheros and a little portion of the Caesar salad I was so disappointed I expected to go downtown because people talk about so many new restaurants hip restaurants coming in....but I  run into this one.  will never go there again did not leave a tip just paid the bill ate half my plate and left"}
{"text":"This is my NEW FAVORITE restaurant!  Boozy Breakfast I had the Glutton Mary... Wow it was a meal in itself... Huge shrimp, kim chi, pickles mushroom, olive and togarashi chilli..amazing!  Rick and Luis each had the Benedict-Braised pork, poached eggs with a chipotle hollandaise sauce and potatoes.  I had the Peaches and Cream Belgian Waffle with a bourbon caramel sauce with sweet whipped ricotta cream! Then we had to split a Cinnamon Bun with a decadent vanilla cream cheese with Vietnamese cinnamon!  The atmosphere is urban chic windows filling the dinning area with natural light.  Friendly wait staff an open kitchen with a wood burning oven professional chefs working diligently creating masterpieces with each meal!  The full bar and bartender who made a piece of art with my Glutton Mary!  Superb! You can tell the entire staff love the food and have the passion to make your dinning experience extraordinary"}
{"text":"This is a very cool and laid back restaurant. I had the opportunity to go for dinner and lunch. However, some of the dishes were hit or miss for me. For brunch I had the zucchini sandwich which was a good option if you like vegetarian food. We also tried the caramel apple fritters which were very good at a really reasonable price. 

We also tried the chicken salad sandwich. This dish had a good flavor. The bread was nicely toasted and the chicken salad was fresh and tasty. Although, both dishes were good, there are no items that I would remember. Overall, the restaurant has a very nice atmosphere and good service. 

Tip of the day: if you like cider, make sure you try the Crispen 15 men cider."}
{"text":"Another addition to the burgeoning downtown one-word-title dining scene (add to Chow, Eat, Bocho, and I'm sure there are others ...) that brings a solid American dining fare experience to your table. Speaking of tables, they have an outdoor seating area which I highly recommend you take advantage of while you can.

Opens at 11, on weekends expect a brunch crowd to be in full effect. For good reason, mind you: the bar does its thing well, and the food is consistently on point. About that food: I love the fresh bread, and the burgers are killer. I've also had their Italian sandwich, and a few of the salads, and nothing was lacking.

Add to the food the solid service, and you've got a good choice for dining any which way you like it."}
{"text":"Even with all the construction surrounding this spot, it's still a diamond in the rough! As of late, gastropubs have been my choice of dwelling, and this one didn't disappoint. Everything from its New York-aestheticized decor to its super cool, super casual staff uniforms, you feel at home at Glutton the minute you step in the door.

It didn't take much for my server to talk me into the lunch special, a succulent lamb burger topped with lettuce, cucumber, goat cheese & tzatziki dressing on a whole grain bun. Everything on the menu was appetizing; however, I can never pass up on lamb as an option. I devoured half, along with an arugula-based side salad, and two glasses of Riesling. Everything was impressive. I'd go again... and again... and again!"}
{"text":"A party of 6 went for the first time before seeing a play at A Public Theatre Company.  The combination made for a perfect Downtown experience.  Our server at Glutton, Mike, was excellent.  He had a beautiful sense of humor, he guided us through the specials of the day, and was just a great addition to the incredible food that came to the table.  Shrimp and corn over the top good, Calamari was crisp and perfect and Tuna tacos a hit.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went for lunch the other day and had the zucchini Parmesan sandwich, it was amazing! It tasted very fresh and wasn't heavy. The Merica cocktail was very refreshing as well! Our waiter was great to us, had a great attitude and sense of humor. I'll definitely be back soon !"}
{"text":"This is a fun and hip location in the newly renovated part of downtown. I really enjoyed the burger on a fresh bun! Service was top notch! 
We will need to return to try some more groovy menu options!"}
{"text":"I took my father there for fathers day, and we attended what they call the Boozy Brunch. The place is not huge, but has a nice ambiance and set up to it. Its located right across the street from Container Park, and parking was easy to find too. The kitchen is an open kitchen, and surprisingly really small, but they make it work. Everything we ordered tasted really good. Service was great too, the waitress was also very engaging and nice to my 5 year old too, which was a nice touch. The owner is the chef and is always there too. You can tell he cares and has a passion for the place. We had the pickled tomato with whipped ricotta and grilled bread as one of our appetizers, it was fantastic. The Pancakes were so fluffy and hot when they came out, it was hard not to eat it all. Defiantly a place to check out."}
{"text":"Our server, Justen, was exceptionally knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent service though he may have had a cup or 2 of coffee too many that day.  We shared 3 dishes, starting off with an order of pickled tomatoes with whipped ricotta and basil that we spread on slices of grilled baguette.  What a beginning!  Next came Japanese street corn kissed by miso butter and chives that was so beautiful that I actually hesitated for a nano second before diving in.  The finale was a pasta dish, garganelli, featuring smoked chicken, caramelized onion, ancho garlic cream and Parmesan cheese - how good does that sound?  Each dish was beautifully plated and delicious.  A rating of 4.5 would be most appropriate.  This restaurant is included in the 2016 edition of Eating Las Vegas, The 50 Essential Restaurants."}
{"text":"So if u have never tried sweetbreads do it here. The pork rinds are the best. 

Start off light with the Improved Mule cocktail.  And the whipped riccat. 3 off us have eaten 10 different things so far and not found anything that was not great."}
{"text":"1. The owner remembered me by name.
2. The burger, which I expected to be... you know, good... I have come to believe is a strong contender for Best Hamburger in Vegas. I kid you not. And believe me I've made the rounds.
3. They let you buy the staff a round of beers for $5. It's on the menu.
4. The rice pudding arancini is an intense, and intensely delicious, knock-your-palate-upside-the-head dessert of several complementary flavors. It's like an HDR photo for the mouth.

Definitely check this place out. As the name suggests, the food is delicious and immodestly rich (tho not gratuitously or grossly so -- this place ain't no Heart Attack Grill). A few dishes are small-portioned but overall, very good."}
{"text":"In response to another review, why the huge belly logo? Well personally for me when I come here I order 6 dishes, I don't care about calories or fat, and I leave when pretty much that same tummy :P

Perfect spot in DTLV, ever changing menu, deals, and delicious plates. 

I always sit at the open kitchen. Why not enjoy the view and smells or your food being cooked? I also like to visually see the other items on the menu, and that's how I order more.

I have yet to order a dish that I haven't loved and scraped my plate clean. Pasta, meat, cheese, bread, salads, (mouth is watering). I love the young ambitious hearts cooking the food! 

The staff is always friendly and welcoming. I always find myself chatting with the chefs.

My only dislike are the hours! I with they were open later, as a Vegas local I find myself craving their plates at 11pm. 

This is a place that I'm ALWAYS excited to come back to. With an incredible menu that always has something new, great location and staff, how could you not want to try this place!"}
{"text":"I had the Bacon and Fig Flatbread.  It was phenomenal!! I was in a hurry and the staff was extremely accommodating. Chef James whipped it up in under 10 min from scratch. The fig and crescenza and blue cheese additions to the flatbread gave it some delicious sophistication.   Would definitely come back and I heard the Peach Cobbler is really good.  Bradley and Joe did an incredible job with the menu and decor, really liked the back patio as well.  Nice touch gents and best of success on your first entrepreneurial venture together."}
{"text":"The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that the drinks took a little long to arrive, but everything else was excellent. The servers were attentive and helpful, the atmosphere was upbeat, and the kitchen/cooking is easily viewable in the center of the restaurant. We ordered the spicy pork rinds which were delicious, although not spicy at all. The glutton burger is absolutely delicious! A richly flavored burger served with herb fries. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Cute, fun and yummy! The restaurant is very cute and the staff is friendly. The food is amazing and their menu has some very tasty and healthy options."}
{"text":"Omg, I just had the best meal ever!!! gluttonlv I love you! Every restaurant is doing the Ahí Tuna tacos but yours are thheeeeee best!!! And this corn with a miso butter made my belly so happy! Cucumber soda anyone? So refreshing! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Another great place in the downtown area that includes Carson Street Kitchen and Therapy making this a can't miss area. Glutton has a good location though not on the beaten Freemont path but very easy to find if your looking for it. Lots of Windows and cool interior. Not small but compact but not crowding. Very shareable dishes"}
{"text":"My new favorite downtown LV!  Server Jade was terrific. Every bite was excellent (except the liver)."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Can't get the street corn and cauliflower out of my head. Been here with groups and with one other friend. Service is excellent - why is it always empty when I go in though? fantastic addition to DTLV.

try everything on the menu. EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. Wanted to like the food even more than I did. It was good. In some cases better than good. Just not great. Great hand made strawberry lemonade. Poutine was solid. The chicken was tender but didn't have a lot of flavor w flavorful cornbread. Filet/sirloin was prepared well med rare and was solid but i didn't care for it being slightly blackened. The veal reduction sauce was different, didn't hate it but didn't love it. The peach salad was good and Id get it again. The peach cobbler wasn't bad. I'll come back because I like supporting the downtown project and its a cool location with cool atmosphere. Liked sitting at the bar and watching the kitchen."}
{"text":"3-1/2 stars. This review is for dinner items. The extra 1/2 star is for the service. The name of the restaurant itself made me want to try it - who doesn't want a gluttonous experience right??? Glutton has a somewhat quiet, romantic atmosphere and nice modern decor. It's conveniently located on the corner of Carson and 7th, (a block from Container Park). Came in around 8pm and was seated right away. 

Here's what we ordered: 

- Shaved Brussel Sprouts
- Bacon & Fig Flatbread
- Squid Ink Pasta
- Brown Butter Gnocchi

First of all, the Shaved Brussel Sprouts - I liked it! It was like eating a small crunchy salad that had the texture of raw cabbage. You could really taste the parmesan and tahini vinaigrette. I would definitely get this again.

Next, we had the Bacon & Fig Flatbread - it was a little too sweet and on the plain side for my taste. Wasn't salty enough. More blue cheese probably would have made this pop. I was looking for a contrast of texture and flavor, but didn't really get it. Kind of reminded me of a mini pizza with no cheese and no toppings.

Squid Ink Pasta - I was expecting to get the pleasant saltiness of the squid ink, but didn't get it. Also, the pasta was a little too al dente for my taste. Very forgettable. I've been searching a long time for the perfect squid ink pasta, but unfortunately, this isn't it. I guess I'll have to keep looking. 

Brown Butter Gnocchi - the braised pork cheeks were tasty! The gnocchi itself, however, didn't do anything for me. No emotional spikes here.

Lastly, service - service was excellent. Server made sure our drinks were full, always smiled and checked on us frequently. 

I will come back to Glutton to try their weekend brunch as well as their desserts. Hopefully, that will be a better experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant. I like the concept of ordering small plates and splitting it with the table. That way you are able to enjoy multiple items and not feel overly full.

I started with rose and I really enjoyed it. It was the first rose that wasn't too fruity which was I was in the mood for so I was happily surprised.

We then ordered three small and one regular menu item to split. We had the spinach and artichoke dip, the shrimp, and calamari for the small plates. We then had the pasta dish with pesto as the large plate. We may have over ordered but everything sounded so good! My favorite was probably between the pasta or the dip although I did like it all. 

We didn't get dessert because we were too full.  

The menu items do change seasonally so I would like to see how the menu changes the next time and visit again. 

Another great addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.  Chef Brian and his staff are doing some great things!  Great vibe! All of the food was spot on!  Definitely try the Calamari Fries!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the service here and Justin our server was a ROCKSTAR! We will come back for the AMAZING food, great music and awesome service!!"}
{"text":"I am torn because I've been here before & they were sooooo good! I'll start with the negative. I'm not sure if they are trying to work with a smaller budget now or what, but the food is not the same. Tonight was a disappointment especially for my boyfriend who was craving their \"famous\" burger. He gets their burger EVERY time we come here & loves it....err loved it before tonight. Look at the picture I posted & compare it to the others posted before this...they are NOT the same. The bread was dry and seemed store bought....nothing special. Usually the burger is almost overflowing between the buns. The burger tonight seemed like it was from the neighborhood BBQ. 
Aside from that, the other items we ordered were okay. Some people might think that $15 for a tiny piece of bread with 3 pieces of shrimp is a bit much, but it was actually pretty tasty (as long as you like butter). The watermelon salad never disappoints especially in its presentation. I would highly recommend their lunch menu over dinner. They have a chicken sandwich on their lunch menu that is delicious (if they haven't changed it)! Lastly, the staff is very friendly and provides great customer service."}
{"text":"Dropped into Glutton recently for some brunch with friends and this restaurant did not disappoint. I would definitely return. This restaurant is a great addition to downtown Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I work downtown and always here about how good this place is. Good is a understatement. I asked my server, Dean, what his favorite for small bites was and I was referred the pickled tomatoes. Something I'd never normally get but I tried it and was amazed. He was a great server, polite, friendly, and new the menu with the background of the owner and chefs as well. 5 star place for sure."}
{"text":"Nice oasis off the blindingly hot, fluorescent beaten path! We had brunch, and it was super yummy! Server was great! Atmosphere was perfect.
(My only advice, work on the potatoes, they could be improved!)"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner Saturday night.  We sat at the bar and got to talk to the Chef. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and the food was delicious. We had the pickled tomatoes (amazing), shaved brussle sprout salad, lamb ragu, and the scallops.  Everything was really good. We were really full and had to skip dessert, but we came back by as they were closing and the staff saw us and invited us in for dessert on the house!  How cool is that?  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with great presentation in this spacious restaurant in downtown Las Vegas. Ordered the special Spanish cioppino--seafood stew with scallop, shrimps, mussels ,sea bass and potatoes, calamari fries and short ribs and pasta. The cioppino's seafood was of the larger size, although a bit overpriced because it was exactly one scallop, one shrimp, and one small square of fish. The fries were excellent, and easily the best dish of the three. Crispy calamari drizzled with sriarcha and coated with peanuts, and the portion was nice too. The pasta with the short ribs was good, but the taste was a bit on the bland side. 

Ended the night with cake in a jar, literally a serving of chocolate cake in a mason jar. Decent. 

All in all a pretty good expensive, although the portion was on the small size considering how much it was charged."}
{"text":"Was in downtown Fremont and wanted to eat at a good modern restaurant and yelp lead me here!  Thanks friends. Your recommendation was definitely spot on.  This place has really cute decor and is a simple open space. Our waiter justin was very friendly, informative and enthusiastic. He works damn hard for his money. The menu is small but you feel like there's so many options because you want to try everything. We went with his recommendation and got the special of the day, which was the frisée French salad with pork belly, and the burger. Food came out relatively quickly. The salad was actually a big portion and such a good deal for ten bucks. There was a poached egg that comes with it. You break the yolk and mix it in with the salad. It was heavenly. Loved the crisp greens the dressing and the crispy pork belly. This pork belly was not at all fatty. It was like pork chop meat 

The burger was good as well too. Very juicy and cheesy. We ordered it medium but it came out a little more on the rare side. It was ok for us but if you don't like pink meet you might have sent it back. Burger came with fries in the side. The burger was solid but I didn't think it was as special as the salad. 

Would definitely come again to try more things!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely Sunday brunch here this weekend. I had a peach bellini and the ultimate breakfast sandwich. Food was very good and a nice atmosphere. My friends both had the bloody mary which was big and crazy and apparently spicy. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was Delish!!! The cinnamon roll was sinful on a Sunday! I also had a Moscow Mule in an authentic cooper cup and brass handle. The service was impeccable the minute we walked in! We were greeted with a smile and a song, lol! Our waiter Justin was on point! Our water and drinks kept flowing! This is my spot!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to come here for almost 2 years. Luckily, my bf has moved downtown so I can always stay at his place and try all the interesting restaurants downtown!

Glutton was pretty okay! We went for brunch on a sunday. We got a bloody mary, a benedict, and a scramble. We also got these tuna tacos.The bloody mary was okay, very overpriced because you're essentially paying for the tiger shrimp inside it. The waiter was really sarcastic and unhelpful. He was trying to be a cool downtown hipster by pranking us saying that glutton was a vegan restaurant as soon as we ordered something with animal products like shuuuutuppppp.

The food was VERY basic overpriced hipster food which was disappointing because I was hoping this place would be different from the rest of the restaurants downtown. Our bill came out to a whopping 86$ which is insane. The food was okay, but the tuna tacos were horrible. They were deep fried chip tacos with baby pieces of ahi or whatever.. we couldn't even finish them lol. 

I might be back for drinks !"}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday dinner. Atmosphere nice and relaxing cool vibe with the open kitchen. Ordered the ricotta tomato side dish tasted good but a very small portion. Loved the pork rinds but ask them to place the cheese sprinkle on the side unless you like the flavor of Doritos. Enjoyed the Brussel sprout salad, also very small. The half chicken was dry and nothing special.  The others in our party ordered the fig flatbread and said it was ok not great.  
Finally the Best part was the peach cobbler to die for incredible. For 3 of us it was $110 with no alcohol. Left not terribly impressed. The name Glutton gives the impression of good comfort food. More like a tapas place where many orders required
If not for the dessert would of left unsatisfied..."}
{"text":"\"Pig in a poke, it pay to be a glutton.  Pig in a poke.  Oink.  Oink oink\"

Unfortunately, Glutton, an American urban bistro, doesn't quite live up to its excess implying name but what it does deliver is good.

Part of the DTLV revitalization, the eatery has a contemporary feel with a real life, off Strip vibe flowing through it.  A breath of fresh air.

Brunch (served Saturday and Sunday only) showcases stepped up versions of American classics.  A stack of yeast risen pancakes griddled in butter with a side of maple cider syrup, rich and indulgent.  Fluffy with pronounced chew.  The Benedict, swaps out the Canadian bacon with a flavorful, braised then pulled pork topped with a chipotle hollandaise with enough kick to keep the dish interesting, better than most.  Finally a refreshing watermelon salad, bites made sweeter by the inclusion of acidic tomato and zesty vinaigrette and a sprinkle of ricotta crumble.  Cucumber and toasted hazelnuts add texture.  A welcome palate cleanser

Dinner offerings are mainstream urban bistro done better than most.  Brussels sprouts are hot, this one done with shaved Brussels sprouts with their inherent bitterness accented by shaved fennel bulb and fronds, and kale tossed in a vinaigrette.  Exudes freshness.  Pickled tomatoes sit atop a airy whipped ricotta.  Add olive oil and basil, spread on some grilled bread and create the \"bruchetta\".  The creamy goodness suddenly interrupted by the pop of tart, tomato goodness.  

Other notable though slightly flawed dishes include a curried cauliflower (tasty but slightly overcooked) and the  calamari fries (tender but kabayaki sauce makes the dish too sweet).

Good service with personality.  Well chosen list of libations.  Reasonable markup.

All told, a great addition to DTLV and a solid spot for some snacking when on the downtown pub crawl.

\"Pig in a poke, it pay to be a glutton.  Pig in a poke.  Oink.  Oink oink\""}
{"text":"This place is a great alternative to eat. when you don't feel like waiting forever. I'm really surprised it's not busier for brunch. Especially because they serve alcohol. 

I've been here a couple of times now and I've always gotten great food, drinks and awesome service. 

Yesterday, we tried the Benedict and the chicken fried ribeye. 

The Benedict - very, very good. It has a good spice with a kick to it that makes it a tad different than everywhere else. Also, the potatoes they serve are insanely good 

Chicken fried ribeye - it was okay. It was very salty, so much that I had to scrap a lot of the breading off. It wasn't bad, just not my favorite. 

Also, their drinks here are really good. We had mimosas. 

Overall, we really like this place. I'd love to go back for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"Been there the 4th time now and love everything on the menu. I would really suggest to give the half chicken a try. It comes on a bed of a jalapeño cornbread pancake and it's heaven for your taste buds. Happy hour ends at 630pm so get there early."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Very comfortable/inviting decor and vibe. Great service by Mike! And then there's the food....BLOWN AWAY. The creativity, effort, and passion that is put into each dish is so evident. From the hand-made pasta, to the in-house smoked chicken, and the popcorn-infused ice cream, my taste buds were incredibly stimulated. I can't wait to come back and support this small business and my belly! 15 BILLION STARS!"}
{"text":"Are here for lunch and breakfast, and both times the food was good but too high priced."}
{"text":"This is probably my most favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Their food is amazing and the waiters are very friendly and give you all the details of the foo before you order."}
{"text":"Cute little place, with awesome food! Came here with my family on a Tuesday night, we were a party of five people. Even on a Tuesday the place was almost completely full. I called ahead to reserve a table because we were coming from the Vdara on the main strip. Here is what we enjoyed:

-Beet Salad: the plating was very artistic and the flavor profile was quite tasty
-Calamari fries: nice and tender
-Curried Cauliflower
-Cavatelli & Short Rib: cooked perfectly, so yummy
-Garganelli: the smoked flavor on the chicken is a beautiful touch
-Glutton Fried Rice: the rib-eye was tender, the kimchi friend rice was also delicious 
-Striped Bass: Flaky fish
-Caramel Corn Profiteroles: the popcorn ice cream though!
-Chocolate Bread Pudding: perfect ending to a great meal

If we are back in the area I would definitey come back here again. We loved it that we even made sure to buy the \"Shift Beer\"(Tips that go to the cooks). 

Restrooms: Clean and stocked!"}
{"text":"Visited Glutton with my mom on Sunday. We originally wanted to go to EAT but it had a huge line and we thought - why not test out this place? The person sitting near the window was eating a super delicious looking burger that seemed to have caramelized onions so we were like yes - this place!

The meal started on a weird note. The busser said he was \"meticulous\" in cleaning his tables as he filled our water glasses, even though the glasses stuck to the tables which was disconcerting.

The brunch menu was heavy on alcohol and light on food - I think there were only about 10 - 15 menu items. No worries because everything was a little unexpected from the typical brunch menu - but there was a \"breakfast plate\" for the boring people of the world as well. 

My mom got a wild mushroom omelette with goat cheese (and I think a bit of truffle oil). It was rich and super delicious - and came with awesome duck fat fried potatoes. 

I got the zucchini parmesan sandwich - crazy good. The chunky tomato sauce on the bread was sweet and super awesome. I knew it had to be on the menu for a good reason - and definitely loved my choice. I barely ate the french fries - but they were very good as well. 

We both had coffee - really good. You can tell it's a hipster spot because they only have \"Sugar in the Raw.\" :)

Definitely would recommend and come back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Eric was our server and we WILL BE BACK! Awesome personality, amazing food! I even let him pick out my food after I was torn between two items & didn't know what it was until it came to the table. Can't get any better"}
{"text":"I'm always looking to try new eateries in Las Vegas that don't involve the same tired buffet or diner. I was noticing some new places open up off the beaten path downtown and Glutton looked like a new place to try. We walked by and the hostess saw us looking in the window and walked outside to give us a menu. She was very helpful and you can tell she genuinely enjoyed being there and loved to answer questions so on her attitude alone, we went inside for dinner. We were really hungry, but our awesome waitress told us that the best thing to do is order a few things and split them, so that's what we did. We were really hungry so we decided to order a lot of things to try. Even though the place had a few people dining, the food came out FAST...very cool.

For starters, we ordered the shaved brussel sprout salad and the watermelon salad. I've had watermelon and feta salads before and loved them so this sounded like a good bet. The portion wasn't huge but a good size, especially for one person. It had red and yellow watermelon and the sauce/cheese combination was fantastic. It was better than I was expecting. The brussel sprout salad though was even better. It was sort of the consistency of shredded cabbage but not as tough and a LOT more flavorful. We couldn't eat that salad fast enough. A+ on that.

For our entrees, we got the Brown Butter Gnocchi and the Glutton Burger. The gnocchi were perfectly cooked and the pork cheeks that went with the dish just melted in your mouth. the sauce this all was bathing in was nectar of the gods. Absolutely delicious. Then came the burger...and this was no ordinary burger..it was the best I've ever had and that says a lot considering Vegas has a specialty burger place in every casino now and I've eaten at many of them.

No, this piece of heaven on a fresh bun (from a local bakery) wasn't just a dressed-up bunch of ground beef...no way. The meat is a combination of brisket and short ribs...yeah, it's that amazing. There was just enough mayo on the burger to give it some zest and to top it all off, freshly made homemade pickles and fresh cheese made right in the restaurant. I'm drooling on my keyboard just thinking about it. Seriously, you haven't had a hamburger until you've had one at Glutton.

To wash it all down we had a few adult beverages from their very hipster-esque alcohol selection and how could we not be gluttons if we didn't have dessert. We opted for the Maple and Marscarpone Cheesecake. It was like eating a cloud of cheesecake goodness. 

An absolute epicurean delight and the entire experience eating here was an absolute treat. We will certainly be back and look forward to bringing others in the future as well to one of our newly found favorite places in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"4 stars because the service was excellent. As a member of the service industry I value good customer service, even though the food wasn't phenomenal I'll be back just for the pleasant and comfortable environment.

-I got the pickled tomatoes as an appetizer. Those were delicious! Of course you must be a fan of tart and heaps of melt in your mouth ricotta. For $9 it was very tasty and unique & came with nicely grilled bread to spread (I've seen similar appetizers elsewhere that charge $12-16 so it was a fair price I thought)

-the cheeseburger...or maybe it didn't even have cheese? It tasted identical to fatburger. I was a manager at fatburger for sometime so I definitely am not making that one up. Nothing bad about it because fatburger is awesome but not the quality or taste you expect for $11 at a sit down restaurant that recommends it as one of their most popular menu items.
(The fries were even more sub par, not bad for shoestring. Maybe I'm just picky but I swear I've been to local bars and shifty fast food joints that had better fries)

-the last entree was the short ribs with a pasta side. I don't remember exactly what it was called but with the limited menu you can't miss it. $23 and topped in at one of their most expensive menu items. The short ribs were yummy! That's undeniable. Considering they describe how long they are cooked for I would hope for yummy. The noodles were bland and very very rubbery. The best part was the sauce that gets thicker as you eat by mixing in another glob of what I assume is a ricotta of some form. I wasn't fully disappointed in this plate as overall the flavors were great and watching it made from scratch in front of me showed regardless of my opinion it's being made well and right, but for $23 it just left a sour taste in my mouth.

After an overall $50 check for two it was not the worst night out but also not the most satisfying. I did not feel any glutton, instead I still felt hungry. 

But again...the service was so excellent and our waitress was the sweetest. I'll be back for a beer and maybe once again try a different entree. 
It's downtown....so you can't expect cheap eats but there are definitely places that don't leave you feeling empty after spending half a bill."}
{"text":"I honestly can't think of one negative thing about Glutton. I ate here two days in a row with two big parties each time and everyone loved the food and the experience both times. The service was impeccable! They have friendly staff, the Chef's came to our table several times to thank us for coming and made sure we were enjoying the food, the waiters we had went above and beyond for us. The food is out of this world! I tried pretty much everything on the menu and was impressed every time. Definitely one of my staples that I'll be going to regularly. Give this place a shot if you're looking for a great dining experience all around."}
{"text":"This is one the best restaurant we ever been , the food is just unbelievable great!! Everything !!! We get Japanese street corn !!! OMG!!! Then salad with watermelon ))) tuna taco!! Yes! The staff is super friendly and atmosphere is great!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"One Sunday we were trying to locate a different restaurant to try out that had a variety of menu items and the football games on. Well, let me say that we were more than surprised when we arrived at Glutton. Glutton had everything that we were looking for... they had a football game on and a variety filled brunch menu. During our visit we had the duck fat potatoes, the caramel apple fritters, Yeast Risen Pancakes, and Huevos Rancheros. Man, was this food AMAZING!!!! This place is truly a hidden gem in downtown Las Vegas. The bartender was great at making suggestions for us to try out and the chefs were really nice as well. I say everyone must come and try this place out, it will make you want to come back for more."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service and food are fabulous! I love sitting at the counter and watching the chefs cook. The I had fried chicken (new menu item) and it was sooo good! You can taste the sake from the brine! mmmm The eggplant caponata and the shrimp scampi are my two favorite items on the menu. Can't wait to come back and explore more!"}
{"text":"More than a little impressed by brunch at Glutton shortly after the Saturday-Sunday menu was launched, it was with four friends that dinner was planned in the small dining room off Carson Avenue this past Friday, Chefs Bradley Manchester and Joseph Kudrak given carte blanche to serve as they like with the exception of a few requests.

Admittedly a bit of a misnomer in terms of name and signage, the small-plates portions and delicacy of the food not really prone to bursting belts or making one feel too-full-to-walk, Glutton represents the vision of a Chef who turned away from the confines of Casino kitchens in order to follow his heart and with a menu riffing on comfort food classics reinvented with interesting ingredients it was in seventeen plates that appetites were invested, all but one succeeding in its premise while several were amongst the very best in class.

Small in space and high in style, the wood tables atop cement floors and open kitchen beneath exposed ceilings following a path traveled by many hip spots in cities across the United States, the pride of Glutton is found in a wood burning oven used in many of the restaurant's preparations, and updating the menu far more quickly than many of its East-of-Strip brethren it was in the now familiar pig-skins that the evening got started, only one item to follow a repeat from just a few months prior while some were just introduced that night.

Playing to my ears in terms of soundtrack while sending out plates in rounds that never once led to the table being overwhelmed, it was on the heels of a hearty caponata that the evening's first \"wow\" moment occured, the delicate taste of creamed salt cod packed into wonton wrappers absolutely delicious with just a kiss of sweetness while the follow-up flatbread was unfortunately less balanced, the raddichio a bit too bitter when paired to the crust's blister as both pork and pesto were mostly lost in the mix.

Quickly regaining traction with two salads that showed not only the quality of Glutton's produce, but also the skill of Manchester and team for reinvigorating tired trends, suffice it to say that beets amidst goat cheese and pistachios were every bit as boldly flavored as they were beautiful while the shaved sprouts and 'superfood' found new depths of flavor when tinged with dill and the unexpected aromatics of toasted sesame seeds.

Progressing on a trajectory of flavors that grew bolder by rounds the two items presented next comprised the last of the menu's small-plates, and although the flank steak beneath mushrooms and blue cheese was almost too rich to be enjoyed past more than a few bites it was a sidedish of corn that had the whole table swooning, each roasted kernel glistening with butter while the Japanese accents contributed volumes of umami and just the slightest hint of spice.

A bit saddened to see the brown butter gnocchi finally removed from the menu despite being a hit from day one, it was at the gratuity of Chef Manchester that the dish made one last appearance alongside two new pastas for round five, and although both the springy Cavatelli and Butternut Squash pockets grounded in celery root were absolutely flawless they still could not match the complex flavors of tender potato dumplings tinged in soy beneath supple pork cheek, pine nuts, and sage.

Taking a well calculated risk with poultry in a final pair of savories, suffice it to say that Manchester and Kudrak are not afraid to use one the bold flavors of swine to augment something less rich and although some may say \"why bother?\" using turkey to craft meatballs if they are only to be blended with guanciale the results were, in fact, outstanding amidst a bowl of creamy polenta, the pepper stuffed roulade no less enthralling with smoky notes finding their foil in a sauce of sweet bourbon.

Again a bit sad to see the rice pudding arancini axed from the menu it was with a 'one of each' finale of desserts that the meal would end and although the newly launched brunch-only caramel apple fritters could have benefited from a bit higher center-to-surface-area to circumvent some oiliness both the cheesecake and churros were reference standard in their execution, the signature profiteroles with flavors of Cracker Jack still undoubtedly Sin City's very best.

**** Willing to take chances while other restaurants seem content to sit back and rely on celebrity marketing or familiarity to push their brand anyone interested in food would be well served to stop by Glutton in order to see what Manchester and his team are doing, the results not quite perfect yet perhaps all the better for it from a kitchen that shows no signs of stopping...or even slowing down to take a breath."}
{"text":"I would have given five stars for the ham and cheese omelet w duck fat potatoes I had today, but it took a good long while until we finally told the greeter that we were ready to pay and leave. Both I and my lady thought we detected a little \"whatever\" attitude early on after a question I had. Don't get me wrong, I could have summoned the server earlier, and the food was delivered hot and promptly. Everyone has a bad day?

In any event, the food was fantastic. The omelet was loaded with ham, but the ham type (shaved Serrano & Tasso), and maybe the gruyère cheese made it not overpowering with salty, and instead, it was mouth watering until and including the very last bite of every single thing on the plate. Portion size was perfect."}
{"text":"Love this place.  One of the best burgers I've found in Vegas. Service has been solid too. Good beer selection and skilled bartenders."}
{"text":"The people are SUPER friendly, everyone was great, but the prices are a little high. They even charged me for bread when I asked for a piece with my salad. As you can see from my photo, I had the Caesar salad. It had no crunch on it at all so that's why I asked for the bread."}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience with my family. The pickled tomatoes were incredible!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Especially if you are a foodie. Loved the ambiance, high quality food and friendly service. I wish I knew about this place before. Highly recommend. Not too far from the strip."}
{"text":"So yummy! Sit at the bar, eat, hangout with Dean the barkeep who is great company, a wealth of random information and makes a mean mimosa and Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"I'm sad this place is gone because it had the most amazing whipped ricotta with pickled tomatoes. I would go and eat mainly only that.  Not only because it was delicious, but it was only one of two things that were offered for Vegetarians. The other was the breaded zucchini sandwich. It was ok. If someone knows how they made the whipped ricotta, bring me a gallon of it with that nummy bread."}
{"text":"What a great Sunday brunch we had! We started with the cinnamon roll and pork rinds. The cinnamon roll was to die for. Good texture and fabulous icing. Pork rinds were really good too. Not greasy and tastes like bacony popcorn almost. Our entrees followed- pulled pork Benedict, breakfast sandwich, pancakes with a side of sausage and egg white frittata with a side of potatoes. The food was all around just good, filling, flavorful, and fun. My only negative would be, everything was seasoned really well with the exception of the potatoes, they really just lacked enough salt, otherwise very good execution of a great menu."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I got the watermelon salad and the ahi tacos, which were perfect for a light lunch. The menu changes seasonally, so the next time I go, there will probably be new things to try. (I don't live nearby.) My server was very friendly, and helped me to decide, because there were so many things that I wanted to try. Because my birthday is in a couple of days (and I have no shame about telling people) I also got a caramel corn profiterole on the house, and it was small, and delicious, and a perfect ending to my light pre-birthday lunch!"}
{"text":"I am a local and was really excited about trying this place! I went in with a large group and they were really pushing the \"family style\" dining concept, even though we just wanted to order one item per person. The waiter was off-putting and seemed annoyed that we didn't want to follow the family style rules. 

We asked if we could split the check in any way and they said they could only take up to four equal payments and couldn't split the check by specific groups of 3 or 4 people. So a friend and I who didn't get drinks ended up paying for everyone else's drinks. And then when we got the check there were seat numbers on it with the specific meals that we ordered, so obviously he could have split up the check at least into smaller groups. Anyone who has worked at a restaurant knows splitting checks is annoying, but they were not accommodating at all. 

As far as the food, it was very average and overpriced. Some of the menu items were very small (the gnocchi) and others were very large (the burger) and the menu didn't distinguish between plate sizes- they were all on the same side of the menu.

If you are looking for a place to eat downtown, walk over to the container park or try the other restaurants around. I will not be going back to Glutton."}
{"text":"Came here on a date night, using a gift card that I had won from Hot Havanna Nights at the Mob Museum and everything was really good, but I would say at least a little over priced, or at least I'm cheapie. We tried the strawberry balsamic steak, which really was quite gorgeous, and the Chili shrimp, you only get like...I think it was 3 shrimp?, and a mule, that was half off that night. My date loved every single bite, but this may have been too gourmet and fancy for my palate. Would definitely go back again, but not very frequently. I think I would have liked the lunch/brunch menu better. Oh, the service was really great as well!"}
{"text":"Let's start with how amazing the service is ! They are so sweet and the way they talk to you isn't scripted it's just organically that nice.

Before I get to the food lets talk drinks...
We ordered :

Arnold Palmer w/ Malibu - delicious !
Glutton Mary - the Kim Chee addition to a classic drink makes you want to keep coming back for more.
Summer Peaches - delicious and not too sweet either.

Ok here's the 4-1-1 on the glutton goods:
Steak & eggs - kalbi marination adds a crisp tangy flavor to the medium rare steak. The kimchee rice is something that makes my mouth water just thinking of it.

Benedict - delicious and fulfilling . Definitely something you can share . The braised pork melts in your mouth.

Proper breakfast sandwich- mouth watering perfection.  The potatoes are made with duck fat !! So good! 

For dessert we ordered peaches & cream Belgium waffle. Vanilla bean whip with cider maple syrup. Deathly delicious . Talk about a deadly sin 

Oh and to top it off all food is made in house. 

Come back every chance you get. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on Saturday. The service was great...very comfortable, casual atmosphere. The food? PERFECT! Tasty, great presentation, and right on proportions (not too much)! 

I had the special which was a chorizo scramble. It was a great choice although a difficult choice because the menu was very appetizing. My husband had a WONDERFUL waffle. The pancakes looked scrumptious. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with some good friends. The atmosphere was chill and relaxed. We sat at the bar and the staff were such super friendly and made sure we were okay. Cocktails were amazing, the improved mule and Glutton Mary had a nice kick to it. Their banana bread was delicious and paired really well with their salted coconut butter. The food was awesome too! Definitely will go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"10,000 MUTHAF*CKIN STARS GOES TO GLUTTON.  Seriously, 5 is not enough.  I loved, loved, loved this place!  I rarely get this excited over an establishment or their food.  During my Vegas birthday frenzy a few weeks ago, I bookmarked this place due to all the great reviews.  I found myself nearby on Freemont Street for the Bike Fest and had some hangry-pains.  I almost wandered into EAT across the street by accident (due to too many Bloody Marys) but quickly corrected myself and grabbed a corner table at Glutton.  Brunch was on my mind - coffee, an egg sandwich perhaps, and another bloody mary please.  My husband and I really wanted to grab some food and be on our way.  Luckily they had a \"proper egg sandwich\" on the menu which turned into a sublime, religious experience.  The bloody mary arrived first - fabulous - with a nice, succulent shrimp perched on the spiced rim along with his pickled veggie buddies.  The coffee was rich and bold - just the way I like it.  The service was fast and friendly.  The sandwich arrives with a side of potatoes cooked in duck fat - um YASSS.  The sandwich looks pretty normal at first glance.  When you sink your teeth into the soft briocche bread, then the house-made sausage, then the cage free egg, then the cheese and aioli - it brought a tear to my eye.  You'd think an egg sandwich is relatively easy to make - slap an egg on some bread with some cheese and call it a day.  Nope, not here.  My hubs gets up and asks for the chef.  He literally walked up to him and shook his hand - it was THAT FREAKING GOOD.  I don't care what else they have on the menu.  I will fly to Las Vegas again just to have this sandwich in my mouth one more time.  The chef thought we were nuts, and clearly we are, but I couldn't leave without extending my appreciation and taking a snapshot with the first dude ever to perfect a breakfast sandwich.  My husband said, and I quote, \"If I go to the electric chair, this will be my last meal.\"  Yep, that good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very live/ happening. The food is amazing and well worth the price. Would definitely come back and try the brunch."}
{"text":"There's nothing like going to your pal's birthday dinner at a new restaurant when you've just had a root canal.  Womp womp.
Yes, I showed up with half my face numb, but no way I'd miss my brother from another mother's celebration because everyone knows I love birthdays.  I didn't think I'd get to eat anything that night, but, luckily, the novocaine started to wear off, I got enough feeling back that I didn't bite my tongue off, and I could sample many of the dishes that we shared, family-style. 

Highlights for me, although we must have had almost every dish on the dinner menu since were rolling at least 16 people deep:

-Bacon & Fig Flatbread:  really liked the sweet and salty combo
-Mushroom Poutine: a bowl of these French fries with cheddar curds was sat right in front of me the whole evening.  I ate most of them because they were great and also because everyone else was ignoring them--more for me.
-Japanese Street Corn:  I could have eaten the whole bowl of this corn with miso butter, furikake, and chives, served off the cob, not on it  It was my favorite dish of the evening, but...
-Brown Butter Gnocchi:  Maybe this was actually my favorite dish, or it's a tie with the corn.  The braised pork cheeks were so tender and I'm a gnocchi fan already--loved it.

We had excellent service the whole time, especially for such a large group. Chef Bradley came to the table later in the evening and greeted us, too.
I enjoyed my first visit here and thankfully I didn't miss out on eating. This is definitely the type of place to come with friends so that you can share many dishes like we did. Looking forward to being gluttonous at Glutton brunch next.

{"text":"Our whole experience was amazing due to our awesome server Justen!  He was so passionate about telling us about the food and super attentive, anticipating our wants and needs.  He handled a large party so well!  There should be more Justens in customer service in the world.  As far as the restaurant,  we walked in with a group of 9 and we were able to be seated immediately.  We ordered a wife variety of dishes and most were pretty good and portions were smaller than expected.  The burger is actually the best thing on the menu: so tender and full of flavor. The desserts were also delicious!"}
{"text":"I took my father here last night for his 64th birthday. We ordered two Manhattans or Deer I Headlights as they would call it to start off they were pretty delicious. For food we ordered their Bacon & Fig Flat bread  roasted onion, black mission figs, crescenza & blue cheese, and holy crap I would strongly recommend it! It was a great starter. 

My dad had the Wood Roasted Shrimp it came with garlic bread, parsley salad, bacon scampi butter. It looked pretty good. As for myself I had the Half Chicken featuring white barbecue, cheddar & jalapeño biscuits, kohlrabi slaw. It was a good portion and the Jalapeno biscuit was delicious. 

Overall We had 5 drinks and three dishes it came out to just a bit over $100.00. Also our waitress was awesome. I look forward to walking over more often and sitting at the bar! Thanks and we shall be back!"}
{"text":"Glutton - \"The act of habit of eating of drinking too much\"....Love the title of this restaurant. I just like saying the word and experiencing the act!

On a beautiful, sunny day last week my co-worker and I were looking for a new place to try out  for lunch and I had this place bookmarked so we decided to check it out. 

We were warmly greeted by Dean the bartender and quickly sat by the friendly hostess/server. I perused the menu and I loved the unique twists offered in the dishes. This restaurant is a nice size but there did not seem to be a huge lunch crowd dining here. I know there are so many options downtown now, but I love this corner location. Nice big windows to sit by and watch the interesting foot traffic walk by. The decor is industrious and not fancy but the place gives off a warm, welcoming feel.

We decided to start with the Charred Broccoli. The presentation of this small plate was pleasing and upon my first bite, it was tasty. Then after a couple more bites, I wasn't sure I liked it as much. I am not so sure the butternut hummus went well with the dish. Overall, I would give it a 4/10. Next came the main courses. I ordered the Chilaquiles which featured smoked chicken, fried eggs, queso fresco, wood oven roasted tomato sauce and avocado.  My friend ordered the Zucchini Parmesan Sandwich. I was a little confused when my dish arrived and there was no avocado. I am a huge avocado fan, and I was like, ok where is the AVO??? I asked the server and she ran back to the kitchen and brought me a plate with four slices. I loaded it on my dish and to my utter disappointment, the avocado was not ripe and hard as a rock. I ate it mind you but it provided no good flavor to the dish. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with my choice. The dish came out warm and I prefer my food hot. I did eat most of it but kinda bummed! My friend liked her sandwich but stated that she would have preferred the zucchini to be grilled versus fried. 

Thankfully Dean came over and talked to us about the badass cocktails he makes and invited us to come in and try some. He guaranteed that we would be happy with his service and his drinks! Nothing wrong with the service but just a wrong choice perhaps on my part. I decided I will try this place one more time and hopefully my review will increase to 4-5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place will get a 4 because the food was overall good, but I did have some qualms with it after leaving. No lattes which I find is a must on most brunch menus and also I didn't think the service was very good. We ordered the Egg White Frittata and the Straight Up Breakfast Plate for two people which is a very large amount of food. The frittata was good, but the breakfast plate came with huge sausages that looked like hamburger patties which had very little flavor. 

We were interested in getting the Caramel Apple Fritters but weren't sure if it would be too much food, but the waitress recommended that we do get them so we did. There were three and each was pretty big. They were doughy in the middle and undercooked. We at one and shared this with the waitress who offered to make us a new batch, but we were so stuffed after one that we didn't need two more. She still charged us for these. 

It's a good place overall, long drink menu, and creative plates, and we walked in and got a seat immediately. Friendly staff and right across the street from this cool park with lots of neat boutiques and fun activities."}
{"text":"First experience at Glutton was very nice! The service was top notch. I think our waiters name was Chuck, he was very friendly and noticed my debit card had the Padres on it. He told me he was from San Diego and we chatted about baseball for a few minutes. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, feels like you're in the middle of a neighborhood with the big front windows, we sat right next to the big window that over looks Carson. 

The menu is great! A lot of interesting combinations of ingredients. We started off with the whipped ricotta and tomatoes, it was an excellent appetizer. It is a bowl of whipped ricotta with some small cherry tomatoes they tasted like they were marinated in balsamic. Olive oil was drizzled over the top along with some basil, think caprese but served as a dip with some grilled bread in the shape of breadsticks. 

For our entrees I got the Glutton burger which was an awesome burger, especially the cheese a combination of three different cheeses I think Parmesan, cheddar, and another that I can't remember. The burger was huge and a little messy but very tasty. I upgraded my fries to the mushroom poutine fries, they were good but there was a little bit too much of a \"tang\" for my liking, kind of tasted like a vinegar drizzle, there was just a little bit too much of it I think. They aren't your average gravy cheese curd poutine, still good but different and too much \"tang\". 

My girlfriend had the brown butter gnocchi, it had pork cheek with it I believe. The gnocchi itself was very good and fresh as well as the cheek. The gnocchi was a very small dish, so if you are expecting a big plate or are very hungry you may want to get another plate to accompany it. 

For dessert we had the pineapple upside down cake with Apple cider ice cream. It was a top notch dessert! The Carmel sauce and like a brown sugar cinnamon crumble that accompanied it was a perfect addition to elevate the cake. 

We live just down the street so I'm sure we will be stopping in again at some point to try some other things."}
{"text":"*military discount* 

Went on Sunday 11-1-15 around 5:30 PM for an early dinner.  The restaurant is located on Carson, behind container park, right beside Vegenation and two doors down from Zydeco.  

$28.22 got me the prime flank steak, apple cobbler, and a ginger ale.  

The ginger ale was flat and 3/4 of the cup was filled with ice. 

$8.00 apple cobbler was served first.  I asked for it with the meal but hey, no biggie.  It was served room temperature and very sloppily presented, spilling out of its dish.  I have never in my life been served cobbler at room temperature.  I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be like that and she said \"I'm not sure...it's a new menu item.\"  Then she suggested I pour the bourbon sauce on the cobbler.  Not the best idea since I was sharing the dish with my 16 month old son.  Although I was tempted to help him sleep better than night, I decided that drunken babies are probably frowned upon.  The miniscule scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and the bourbon sauce was the best thing I ate there last night.  

$18.00 prime flank steak with mushroom fondue, blue cheese relish.  This is the worst thing I have eaten in 2015.  Although they managed to make a very modest cut of meat very tender, the flavor was terrible and bland, bland, bland.  I asked for medium and was served an almost well-done piece of meat swimming in the most disgusting vinegar-y sauce.  There was no flavor, no depth, no richness, no salt, only vinegar and blue cheese.  Maybe my palette is not refined enough or something...if this is how rich people eat I'd rather stay poor.  I would rather lick the inside of a dumpster behind a nursing home than eat this again.  

It pains me to give this place such a low review, especially since the staff was so nice to us, but the food was bad.  Next time I will try their brunch or breakfast items."}
{"text":"If it was based on what I had I would give two stars but my family loved their food so they get 4. Admittedly I am a picky eater with other limitations beyond my control so I had to have the hamburger and it was barely edible. However my family had other food including a pasta dish and a shrimp dish and really enjoyed it. Also the service was great."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write a review but I felt the need. Even after sleeping on it I am still frustrated over having dined here. I was so excited over restaurant week and trying this local establishment but the unaccommodating chef and manager as well as the food really put a bad taste in my mouth. The menu offered, had what I thought was a lamb and octopus choice however to my surprise you received both. When I informed our server Jade that I did not eat lamb i asked if I could get a garden salad instead. After she went back to ask the chef, she informed us that there was no substitutions whatsoever and there would be no accommodation made. I asked again if I could get anything in place of the Lamb since I did not eat lamb, the manager then came over and said no. Once receiving the octopus I found it to be extremely overcooked and  unappetizing. Also since I don't eat lamb I wasn't able to enjoy the rest of my meal. The only thing that saved this restaurant was that Jade who was pleasant through service however i would not ever return or recommend for the food quality. I was also surprised that they were so unaccommodating when all i asked for was something that would be a less cost than the original offering due to dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Solid A++..think about it as a simpler Carson Kitchen. I HATE their logo, but really like their food. I mean I hate their logo. Food's great...man that logo...good food."}
{"text":"Everything was so tasty! 
Watermelon salad- so yummy! 
Huevos rancheros was good but not spicy. 
Another at the table had the egg white frittata- she said was wonderful. 
Another at the table had the Parmesan zucchini sandwich - she said was very tasty"}
{"text":"For brunch/lunch, Glutton is very good. We were most impressed with the staff. The bartender/mixologist took our orders and he was very friendly, very knowledgeable and personable. The ambience was laid back and welcoming. It is located in Downtown Las Vegas and in a part that looks like a quaint downtown. The Zucchini Parmesan sandwich was a very nice take on a traditional eggplant parmesan sandwich."}
{"text":"This really has become one of the best restaurants downtown. The food and service are consistently good. I cried when I heard the Curried Cauliflower was going away."}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would. We went there for my boyfriends mom's birthday. She couldn't get in to the place she really wanted to go so we were really hoping for a great time.
The apps (cauliflower Brussels salad and calamari fries )were good, so there's your star.
We ordered 2 of the burgers med rare and they came out well done. I told the waitress and nothing. The menu doesn't say they come with red onion and mayo which I cannot stand the taste of. I still try to eat some of it because I'm not one to complain but this was gross. The birthday girl got the meal w the poached egg on it which came out literally hard boiled! Waitress told chef and he says \"thanks for telling me\" 
No comps, no offer of drink or dessert even for the birthday girl. Just the bill and an apology. 
I've been in the industry for a solid 8 years just in vegas, and customer service is huge. It doesn't affect just one it goes on to everyone we tell. With so many places downtown there's no reason to choose this place let alone ever come back. 
This was our first and final visit. I hope you'll take better care of future customers"}
{"text":"Was in LV for a convention and a friend wanted to go dt to this restaurant and see all the redevelopment. This is a great chef driven restaurant w/small & large plate items (the corn is to die for). Wonderful concept & glad I went."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The watermelon salad and the 'merica cocktail were out of this world and refreshing! Our server was also amazing unfortunately I forgot his name but he was tall and had crazy blue eyes lol would def go back again!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and phenomenal food! We've tried many of these dtlv food joints and this is by far the best. Glutton is cozier; we really enjoyed the atmosphere. Our group loved every dish that came out and we were all blown away by the popcorn ice cream dessert. We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for brunch for the first time on a Saturday. They weren't too busy so we were able to sit at the chefs table where we had a front seat view of the chefs cooking. It was really fun to watch while we waited! 
The waitress we had always checked up on us and made sure we were happy and enjoying our food and drinks. 
Everything we ordered was very tasty !
We had a great experience and look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Such an interesting menu that's surprisingly delicious if you're in the mood for something new. A little bit pricey, but for how delicious it is, totally worth it. Parking can be tough here because there are not many spots and they're metered, but it's worth it. They also have some great outdoor seating.

I've been back several times now and this place is always great. The staff is super friendly. The burger here is amazing, the pickles are a great touch and the patty is a generous size and so juicy-- served with shoestring fries, my favorite. The popcorn profiteroles are delicious as well. The popcorn flavored ice cream has a bit of a different texture, but probably just because it's fresh. It sits in the middle of a tiny sweet pretzel bun that is topped with caramel corn. My personal favorite is the zucchini Parmesan sandwich, it has a super unique blend of flavors, sun dried tomato, aioli oil, Parmesan and fried zucchini being the strongest. Everything here is delicious. I can't wait to try their brunch."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  Can't wait to come back for brunch.  Japanese street corn was amazing!  Such a unique and flavorful dish.  Watermelon salad was light, delicious and refreshing.  Brown butter gnocchi is so rich and delicious.  The peach cobbler is a must have!  Amazing service and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am a glutton for Glutton! Love coming here for lunch when I am in the area. I always get the Chicken Salad Sandwich without bacon. I am very happy that they are able to do it without bacon because a lot of time Chicken Salad is pre-made and they can't leave things out. The fries are tasty, too.

Service is always friendly and prompt, I can get in and out if needed or can linger.

Last time I shared the profiterole dessert with my friend and it was quite tasty. It had popcorn in it, which added an interesting flavor and nice crunch.

If I ever try something besides the Chicken Salad Sandwich I will update, but since I only get to come here every couple of months I like to just my usual."}
{"text":"Really cute place and great brunch spot. We had the Huevos Rancheros and the Breakfast Salad and both were delicious. And the Glutton Bloody Mary was awesome! Great service too."}
{"text":"We chose to sit on the patio which is a really cute and quaint brick walked open space.  Started off with an Aquavito cocktail which was delish and refreshing. My neighbor's Bloody Mary looked really good but I wasn't about to spend $18 on one.  Order the pickled tomatoes as an appetizer and the straight up breakfast with house made sausage and scrambled eggs.  The pickled tomatoes are AMAZING!!! As was the homemade sausage. Our server was sweet and attentive. We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food was really really great. Everything had the right amount of seasoning to add to the flavor. I got the mushroom omelette and even the eggs were seasoned. No extra salt and pepper was needed. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. The chef, James, helped us narrow down our choices. Try the banana nut bread. I have never liked it but was forced to taste it by my wife and It Is The Bomb. Don't tell my wife but tell everyone else. Eat at Glutton!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience... great for a Sunday morning with your 4 legged family... and the food is awesome!!"}
