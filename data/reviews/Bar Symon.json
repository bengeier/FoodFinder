{"text":"Solid choice for airport fare. Stopped in for breakfast before a flight. I ordered the pulled pork breakfast burrito. The pork was tender and flavorful. The ingredients weren't mixed well, however, and I had pockets of eggs, cheese and cilantro clumped throughout. I wish they were more evenly distributed. The homefry style potatoes were top notch, crispy but not dry.   Staff was attentive and upbeat even early in the morning.   Heavy rock and roll music was a bit odd for the AM."}
{"text":"Great place for a meal at the airport. I had the chicken sandwich and a salad for about $16. The sandwich was great and the salad was above average as well.  Would definitely stop in again when here."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant this is a pretty good one. Fast efficient service. Cool decor. Had the simple salad with chicken and a turkey burger. Fresh & tasty. Can't wait to try it again. That symon guy is pretty annoying but his food is very tasty."}
{"text":"I don't think I will be eating anywhere else in the Pittsburgh airport. Good breakfast with timely service and coffee refills in the bar area."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, I'm very impressed with the atmosphere, menu and of course, the staff. The moment I walked in, I was asked if there are any electronics I need to charge while I dine in. To me, that's modern customer service and it's awesome!  Since I had time, I decided to indulge myself. I had the Fat Doug Burger with Parmesan Rosemary Fries (note: the french fries are separate). The presentation is comforting and they brought the food pretty fast.  All I can say, yummy! I can't believe I'm eating this kind of a culinary experience in an airport. So bravo Chef Symon! Bravo!"}
{"text":"We all know that airport food is overpriced, but this place is good.  Would have personally like a bit less past and a bit more feta, but the Mac & Cheese with ground lamb is good. Fries perfectly cooked, and Parmesan + Rosemary topping a great compliment. Decent beer selection, both on tap and in bottles, with a full bar. Helpful, friendly staff. Garage decor and staff in grease monkey garb a bit of a stretch. However, next time I have to find food at this airport it's good to know that there's at least one place that is good and out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Great place especially for an airport.  At the start of concourse C right in the middle of the gate area  Good tap beer including 2 local and the Lola burger was great if messy. Perfect medium rare though the bacon was kind of thick when biting it with the fried egg. Rosemary fries and the Lola ketchup were worth just going for it and licking the mess of my fingers.   Also has power outlets under the bar at each stool."}
{"text":"Sara and Sean are two of the best behind the bar! Great service, food and laughs. Glad I flew out of PIT. If you are connecting there stop in for sure. If you fly out of PiT, then come to the airport extra early for a bite."}
{"text":"When flying through PIT, Bar Symon is a must stop. I love their interesting burgers and decent draught beer selections. You've got to try the Lola ketchup with the rosemary fries."}
{"text":"I almost walked past this place heading to my gate, and I'm so glad I didn't! I'm an absolute nut for lamb and rosemary, so the lamb mac and cheese was pretty much my personal food paradise. Al dente cavatappi, tomato lamb sauce with definite but not excessive rosemary, and creamy cheese sprinkled liberally on top, served in a piping hot skillet. Ordered the half serving, which was definitely a reasonable portion size for someone not super hungry and not looking to gorge, but was a little sad when it was all gone.  I wouldn't specifically aim to fly through Pittsburgh or Dulles for the purpose of eating here, but any time in I'm either airport, I will absolutely want to come back, and I realize I'm due for my first trip to Michael Symon's place in my own city."}
{"text":"Enjoying a great lunch ( bacon cheeseburger with an egg, pickled red onions on a brioche bun - fresh cut chips - and 2 house made sauces: Lola Ketchup ( has a nice chili/cumin flavor without being spicy) and Coffee BBQ ( coffee undertones with a cayenne kick later)... on point! Service quick and friendly, surroundings clean, prices reasonable ($12 burger, $15 with the fresh cut chips, $2+. Iced tea). Very filling and delicious!"}
{"text":"Scrambled eggs encased in oil from griddle. Not edible. Location not clean.  Eggs really aren't scrambled.  Fried shingle of oil u cant taste the egg.  Had to leave it behind.   In a word, horrible"}
{"text":"Beats the usual airport fair. Good selection of microbrews. Had the 'fat Doug' burger with some chili cheese fries, juicy and tasty, decent chili too. The coffee BBQ sauce was worth a try, good stuff. Service was fast and attentive. Great menu options."}
{"text":"Fantastic, warm service worth a relaxed atmosphere for the worried traveller. The bbq sauce is superb!"}
{"text":"We had an hour and a half to kill in the Pgh. airport before flying back from the Thanksgiving holiday. Saw this place and decided to try it - what a find. Couldn't decide between Mac N Cheese or the fries, so did the Parmesan/Rosemary fries and the pulled pork sliders. Both were wonderful, the fries to die for. Next  time the Mac! Bartender was friendly, two football games to watch, and the wine list very interesting. No Woodbridge here and for beer drinkers, a great selection of craft brews. I don't know if this is their only location, but they should try to expand if not. Hope we have extra time next trip to return!"}
{"text":"Great food. Not sure they get the whole airport thing. Taking the order took quite awhile. Had to have food boxed to make the flight. Hope the folks next to me in the plane enjoy."}
{"text":"Mr Symon Inspiration without execution is a fatal flaw. Your name drew me to look, the menu brought me in, but I was highly disappointed by the stale challah bun, dry burger, and French's onion crunchies that made up my $20 meal of a burger, fries, and ice water. I admit the Rosemary fries were very good, but they could not make up for the awful burger. Service was great too but...  I walked out wishing I would have just chose one of the nearby consistent fast food stands."}
{"text":"Chili is great for an airport restaurant, burgers are decent as well. Good beer and booze selection."}
{"text":"Honestly, I expected better.   Had the bacon burger with rosemary fries.  Fries were awesome, the burger... meh.  Just average."}
{"text":"was passing thru Pitt and had a few hours to kill so I saw this place and gave it a shot  Good points  Great mixed drinks - had the ginger beer/vodka drink - very very tasty  the YO! burger - good with many flavorful toppings that all worked well together outlets for devices everywhere (okay so this doesn't have an impact on the food but still was a nice touch  the not so good points the much touted parma-rosemary fries - sure the toppings tasted well but shoestring potatoes? would have been better with thicker cut fries and the Parmesan cheese? would have liked a courser shred so that it would have melted onto the fries   overall its a step up from the usual airport dining and we like this trend  btw after I posted this I was contacted by the operators and got some nice feedback that was totally unexpected"}
{"text":"Delicious  burger, great atmosphere, good beer selection, friendly staff. I fly weekly and this restaurant will be a destination stop for me at PIT. Rosemary fries were perfect."}
{"text":"Great beer list and knowledgeable bartenders. Had a great appetizer of pierogies & kielbasa. Will and Kelly made our wait for our plane very enjoyable! Will always stop here before a flight out!"}
{"text":"If you ever have to eat two meals in one day at PIT then go here. I did.   Had the mac and cheese with salad and the chicken sandwich, neither disappointed. Burgers looked good too.  Certainly a better option than the TGI Friday's, which as other reviewers have mentioned, seems to have a stranglehold on concessions at this airport."}
{"text":"I've been to all of Michael Symon's restaurants, so I know the caliber of his cooking. Bar Symon was very good (duck confit sliders were amazing), but it was not great. I think the main problem is that they are so crowded that the front of the house doesn't know how to handle the rush. For example, my Pork Butt would have been amazing- if it had arrived hot- instead of luke warm and fastly approaching cold.   Overall, I highly recommend this place. We spent several hours there on Saturday night- there was a 60 minute wait, but we had drinks on the patio while we waited for the table.   Bottomline: Once the kinks get worked out, this will be awesome. I am planning on going back next weekend so I can try another entree- or maybe just eat a bunch of appetizers for dinner."}
{"text":"OK - I gave Bar Symon 2 stars on my first visit back in March.  Since then, I received a note from the management group with a voucher for a free entree encouraging me to come back.  I had a long wait before my most recent trip and I decided to bust out that voucher and give Bar Symon another chance.    This time, I asked my server for her recommendations.  I ended up with the Bleu Burger and Rosemary Fries.  The burger was amazing.  I mean - it totally hit the spot and it was cooked a perfect medium rare just like I ordered it.  My server also guided me to just the Rosemary Fries - skipping the disastrous Parmesan Fries from last time.  It went great with the burger.  On my second trip, my server, Amy, was so attentive and lots of fun which took the bite out of my hour plus wait for my flight to Boston!  I might have to change up my routine on pre-flight meal out of Pittsburgh.  The management group convinced me to give Bar Symon another chance and I think my last visit sealed the deal."}
{"text":"The food here can vary from day to day, but if you are passing through PITT It is by far the best choice in the airport!"}
{"text":"Ok I was in the Pittsburgh airport at 7:30pm on a Sunday. Several places were rude saying they closed at 8:00 like hurrying us along. But Tarren here at Bar Symon was AWESOME! He needs a raise! So personable and didn't hurry me at all. Thanks Michael Symon!"}
{"text":"Breakfast a-la Symon was pretty good.  Had the bacon scrambled egg sandwich with home fries.  The hot sauce was tangy and spicy, relatively mild though.  I think most people would enjoy it, even those intimidated by spicy food.  Service was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I grade airport restaurants on a serious curve. compared with adjacent alternatives like McDonalds and Friday's, this place is James Beard worthy. the uniqueness of the menu justifies the $2-$4 per meal premium you're paying. if you want cheap, the Golden Arches are right across the terminal. if you want genuine gourmet, eat on the way.   I tried the Pittsburgher sandwich. it was a taste of the region - smoked kielbasa, pierogi (sort of a polish ravioli stuffed with potato and cheese) and sauerkraut with a side of rosemary fries - $15ish. get it to go and grab a bottle of Turner tea from the cooler in Rite Aid - another taste of the area. and try the Sarris chocolate covered pretzels when you're there. I swear they put crack in those things...   even if you don't like it, at least you tried something you won't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Bar Symon is (and this probably goes without saying) some of the best eating in Lorain County. Of course, the bar is likely set a little higher for Iron Chef Symon than it would be for your average strip-mall bar opening.  The main problem with this establishment (and most of the Symon empire) is that demand far outstrips supply. We had to wait 100 minutes for a table for six... on a Tuesday! They seem to be preparing a party room in the adjacent space. I suggest finding out what the rent would be on the abandoned Giant Eagle in the plaza!  The decor is a mash-up of Symon's character - pigs, butcher's diagrams, metal ceiling tiles (perhaps architectural savage from somewhere closer to Tremont?) and - of course - two flat screens above the bar. One shows ESPN (sure to encourage Browns fans to order another to drown their sorrows) and the other - the Food Network. It was a little strange to have Rachel Ray going as we noshed on pork cracklins and drank microbrews, but I guess that goes with the territory.  The beer list is phenomenal. There are over a hundred beers, with 40 draft selections. Bell's Oberon and Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout (both personal favorites) were on tap, as was the perennial house special - $1 PBR.   You'd do well to come in for a drink and tack on a cocktail shaker of the infamous (but perhaps tired?) Lola fries (think upscale McDonald's shoestrings with rosemary and salt) for $3. You'd do even better if you were there between 4 and 6 for happy hour, because that same serving of pommes frites would be only a buck. Another happy hour special is the Bar Symon burger, served on an English muffin with a fried egg, cheddar and bacon - for $5. That's right, we've got your recession extra value meal right here - Bar Symon burger, Lola fries and a PBR for $7.  We started off with the love child of popcorn and bacon, or (as the menu puts it) pork cracklins. Symon's version of the gas station staple pork rinds is served in a wooden pig with malt vinegar. And they do crackle!  The entree list includes a great riff on Barberton Chicken. About the only thing BS's abundant portion of fried chicken has in common with the crap at Belgrade Gardens is that you get four pieces - a leg, a thigh, a wing and a breast. Beyond that (thank god) Symon's honey-touched chicken is a HUGE step up from the \"real deal\" down in Barberton.  The locals are serious about BS. The woman sitting to our left at the bar had scrambled in for the Tuesday night goat taco special. She'd been there on a previous night when they sold out - apparently this normally happens by 7! The guy on our right couldn't stop waxing lyrical about the grilled cheese. (We tried one - good, but nothing to write home about. Stick with the meat at BS, just like you should at any of Michael's restaurants. The only place he wants a vegetarian, as far as I can tell, is possibly on the menu!)  The complimentary basket of perhaps overly chewy bread is served with high-quality salted room temperature butter - yes, I mean they've taken a handful of Kosher salt and thrown it on each pad before it leaves the kitchen.  All of the side dishes were a big hit with our group - creamed corn with bacon chief amongst them. The polenta brought us back to Theory (oh how we miss you!).  The chicken wings are a pretty big departure from the Sriricha-drenched scorchers at Lolita. They have a really light citrus sauce - maybe even just an orange juice marinade. They're impossibly moist and tender, but aren't spicy at all.  Two members of our party went for the pork butt, and both were very pleased with it. Neither of them, however, cared for the slaw - citing heavy horseradish overtones.  The sausage menu is worth exploring, particularly for the mustards and pickled delights on the side. But there's no need for the big board - a single sausage is plenty large enough to share, and there will be no shortage of carnivore's delight later in the meal!  The grilled meatloaf is enormous, and is unfortunately a bit heavy on something along the lines of China five spice. It wasn't what we were expecting, and isn't something we'd probably go for again.  The concrete floor leads to a fairly noisy atmosphere (as one might expect from a bar - do not come here for a quiet conversation.)  The service (once they find you a place to sit!) is great, drawing on a few veterans from Lolita and adding a crew of enthusiastic newbies. They gladly seperated our checks, and clearly communicated (on the credit card slip) about the automatic gratuity due to our party size.  We were all stuffed by the time we were able to take a look at the dessert menu, but felt a Yelply duty to check it out anyhow. It looked like it might be Cory Barrett's crowning achievement, so we made sure to return the next day before we had to head back to the airport. And boy were we glad! The PB&B (peanut butter & banana bread ice cream sandwich) is absolutely not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Wednesday night. Had really really high expectations since we've had stellar service and value for money food wise at Lolita multiple times. Decor is pretty bland, i see what they are trying to do with the whole upscale beer bar and possibly turn it into a chain, but of the food i had it was really over priced. and you want to talk about over priced, the beer list. my freaking lord is it over priced. they took the wine method and thought it could transfer over to beer (take retail and double it at least). well it doesn't really work when there are many many other places that price their beers more competitive. case in point, greenhouse tavern has hoppin frog boris the crusher for $14, that's a 50% markup over retail...not horrible, it's $19 at bar symon. NINETEEN DOLLARS. That's ridiculous. I mean i guess it's out in the middle of no where and there is no real competition, but if you want good beer and good food, go to Lolita and then go to buckeye beer engine or melt or even tremont tap house (and they are in my opinion one of the more expensive places also, but not bar symon bad).   As for the food, we started off with the warm olives (fantastic, very similar preparation to Lolita's), and the chicken wings (a little dry). i ordered the lamb special which was described as \"whole lamb gutted and stuffed with lamb sausage roasted on a spit all day\". i expect some pieces of meat from the various limbs and carcass, but instead i get 2 slices of meat which looks liked they were rolled up with sausage in the middle, and 5 poor looking lemon potatoes on the side. for $18 i expected at least a little pride in the plating. this looked like something i would get at a greek diner for much cheaper. needless to say I'm greek so i thought it was pretty good, but there is no way i would order it again. my girlfriend got the mac and cheese like she always does at Lolita and thought it was wonderful as always (by the way if you like his mac and cheese you can find the recipe online, it's really easy to make).   service was easy going and somewhat attentive.  It's a 35 min drive from my house, so there is no reason for me to come back, I'm glad i went, but i would not consider this in any way a destination restaurant. Let's hope B Spot is better!"}
{"text":"I truly wanted to like Bar Symon, really I did.  So before anyone freaks out on the two stars,  understand that I'm saying \"meh, I've experienced better\", and so have you probably.    We were seated immediately in a comfy booth for brunch, and proceeded to order appetizers, the mussels were completely under seasoned, and the poached egg that came with the pork belly croutons was really really runny.  While my Honey's pastrami hash was pretty tasty, my biscuits and gravy was a bland affair not worthy of being served at an establishment that is owned and operated by someone of Michael Symon's stature.  The gravy wasn't particularly creamy, but at least the biscuits had the expected flavor.  The beer selection looks amazing, and I'm sure Bar Symon will do well, maybe a little bit of time is needed for the kitchen to get its act together."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh airport needs more restaurants like this. Great beer and food selection, anyone can find something that suits them.  They don't just pump out shitty food like most airport restaurants.   The fat Doug burger is a must if your hungry. The fries were great and the Mac and cheese (although I didn't order it) looked fantastic.  It will definitely be something I order next time here.   Bartender was incredibly nice which makes waiting for your flight that much easier.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you have time to kill at Pittsburgh airport.  Nothing else compares."}
{"text":"Terrible breakfast. 2 scrambled eggs must be small size, there are barely any eggs. Bacon is burnt and toast is cold, my butter didn't melt. \"home fries\" are frozen potato cubes with nothing in them. Would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Walking into a Michael Symon restaurant, you are expecting class, elegance, and most importantly, great food.  Bar Symon doesn't disappoint.    From their famous Fried Chicken [rated in the top 10 for fried chicken by Gourmet Magazine] to their eclectic dishes, like beef tongue, roasted bone marrow [summer special on Monday's] and comfort food like the Lola Burger, and Meatloaf.     Dinner isn't the only thing on Bar Symon's mind either.  After checking out their Sunday Brunch [served 10a-2pm] I am convinced this is the best place for brunch on the far west side of Cleveland.  If you are on the west side of Cleveland and looking to show a visitor a good time or just looking for a great meal, Bar Symon is the spot!"}
{"text":"Sinful Sweets Meets Bar Symon once again during travel.  It's my favorite spot to grab a bite and beer in the airport.  Sit back relax with some great food and make some new friends.  Tip they can start serving beer at 7am. Breakfast of Champions."}
{"text":"Loved it! Keep in mind that I'd rather go casual than dressy/fancy most days (if not every day). While I loved the Lola experience, and appreciate Lolita and B-spot for what they provide, I happened to find my \"just right\" Symon experience at this restaurant.  It's in a kind of random spot in suburbia with a huge parking lot. HUGE. That's ok - I'd rather not pay for valet/garage parking anyway.  My husband and I were both able to show up in shorts and flip-flops and not get any weird looks...despite the animal skin draped at the main entrance.  We had to wait about 10-15 minutes, but there were (comfortable) seats at the bar, and a very long beer list! We were seated, greeted, and served with professionalism that I've seen at his higher-end restaurants, even though this was a more \"salt of the earth\" type of place. It was a nice touch. And everything was presented really nicely! I had the \"simple salad,\" with butter lettuce, grapes, hazelnuts, and pickled onions - a new one for me, and a great try. My husband was a freak and got the pork crackling (pretty much deep-fried pork rinds served with malt vinegar).  I had to go for the macaroni and cheese (rigatoni, chicken, rosemary, and goat cheese). Jackpot. The pasta was al dente - perfectly cooked. The chicken was so tender and tasted like it was roasted to perfection slowly as opposed to just thrown on the grill. And I'm not even going to bother describing how well the goat cheese and rosemary complemented everything.   My husband got a smoked pork sandwich between two grilled cheeses. Again, what an animal! He loved it.  This restaurant takes reservations for parties of 6 or more - and there were a few of those types of groups there last night, just out with friends/family, or celebrating a nice occasion. Very nice feel to the place, with a patio I'd like to try at some point.  For those who said that this restaurant misses the mark re: the signature of Michael Symon, I can sorta see that. But to me, it was a great mix and match of his best \"not so pretentious\" dishes that make this establishment that much more accessible to newbs who might not know about him."}
{"text":"Really good smoked turkey sand which.  Sad fries not included for 11 bux.    Happy they had many good beers on tap.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the BSpot burger joints and feel this is the same atmosphere and quality of food.  I had the Lola burger and rosemary fries.  Food was hot and fresh.  Service was excellent.  Very quick to get you to your flight on time."}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing Ohio beer selection. And an awesome wait staff!! This is the perfect place to stop by while waiting at the airport. I will be coming here from now on."}
{"text":"For airport food, this place is pretty decent.  No fancy Iron Chef items here, but good pub grub.  The decor is gas station/mechanic's garage style, but one whose proprietor has OCD because I have never seen a gas station/mechanic's garage look so sparkly clean and stylish.  We ordered cheeseburgers, pierogies, and mac and cheese.  My cheeseburger had bacon, and maybe that's cheating, but it tasted amazing, or maybe it's because I have not had a cheeseburger in months.  The mac and cheese was also a delight, or maybe it's because I have not had mac and cheese in months.  The pierogies were served with a side of kielbasa.  And after having the real deal at S & D polish deli a week earlier, these pierogies were just meh, but the kielbasa!  That was the best part of the dish, but it too has a cheater's nature like the bacon.  My husband also had an adult milkshake, I think it was called a badass milkshake.  With a name like that, it kind of makes you pause and consider whether you really want to have a drink like that before catching a flight.  However, it was all fine, no negative consequences!  All in all, we were pleased.  Service was pleasant and food prepared in a reasonable amount of time.  And yes, it's a little pricey, but so is everything at the airport."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, service was absolutely great (Elizabeth).   I had the big blue salad with a burger patty on top. I really appreciate the option to add a patty on top of any salad for 5 bucks - awesome for low carbers like me.   Prices are reasonable, one star off because my burger came out medium rare the first time - sent it back and came back how I ordered it - well done.    Fun selection of local beers on tap."}
{"text":"I am frankly shocked that a new restaurant opened at the Pittsburgh airport (which has seen a decline in traffic since US Airways no longer has a hub here).  This is a nice clean, large restaurant.  Service is efficient and the food is very good, especially by airport food standards.  They have a variety of 3-4 different Mac 'n Cheeses - all looked good.  I had the roast chicken and goat chesse, which was tasty (bit on the salty side though).  If you have time to kill at PIT, definitely eat here - best restaurant in the airport by far."}
{"text":"Alice from the restaurant reached out to me to say that she took my comments seriously & is sharing feedback with the kitchen.  Hope to give those fries again on my next trip to Pittsburgh:)"}
{"text":"Decided to check out Bar Symon this week with some guests. My experience was an ok one at best. I found the service to be attentive but almost aggressive to get you to order your meals and when you were kind of almost done they kept coming by to try to grab your plate from you. It was a weekday night so I did not see the rush to turn tables since nobody was waiting to be seated.  We ordered the Chips with Artichoke for app - chips were overcooked almost burnt and the artichoke dip lacked flavor unless you found one of the hidden pieces of blue cheese inside then it was tasty! Lola fries were good and at $1 you could not beat them.  I ordered the Fried Chicken and was told it would change the way I saw fried chicken! She was correct, the batter they use is absolutely delicious BUT the chicken itself was a bit dry and strong tasting almost gamy. Overall not impressed with the chicken dish. My counterpart had the pork chop which was mediocre and the balance of the table had burgers which I am told were A+... Dessert menu needs work it is missing some key desserts that could win over diners. Sorbet was was not great only ate about 1/4 of the dessert and the Chocolate Cake was overdone we left about half of that as well (I don't normally leave any desserts on the table!)  Overall would go back to taste more of their extensive beer list which is very impressive and partake in some apps but meals not so much!"}
{"text":"I had some extra time before my flight, and I do love Michael Symon on Food Network, so I decided to stop and have a bite to eat.  I went with the BLT salad and a glass of wine.  Most salads I get out are very sparse on the meat that comes with the salad.  That was definitely not the case here.  My salad came with a well seasoned 8-10 oz portion of chicken.  The veggies were very fresh.  Service was attentive and helpful since I had never been there before.  A great choice from the usual McDonalds and other crappy food selections at airports."}
{"text":"This was a really nice treat to see when I landed and knew I was going to stop in on my return flight.    I had the Fat Doug burger which was fantastic.  Much better then I anticipated. Very flavorful and very juicy.  Also had the Parmesan and rosemary fries as a side.  They were very tasty hug I felt they were over seasoned as I was left with a large pile of the seasoning at the bottoms of the basket.    Will definitely stop in again but with a different choice of side item."}
{"text":"Great food, IF you are not in a hurry and you like waiting on yourself. 5 min wait to get someone's attention to get a table. (This is at noon on a Saturday). Got the order out fast enough, then was ignored for the duration. Had to flag someone down to get a napkin, never did get silverware, could not get a refill on my empty iced tea because I didn't have a waiter and the rest of the staff was sitting around talking or ignoring the guests. There wasn't even someone at the bar to ask, I had to use the bottle of water on the table to fill my own glass!  People were walking to the kitchen to flag a waiter just to get their check (or miss their flight).  Luckily, I did have my check and could use cash to get out of there."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews on Yelp and thought I would give it a shot. The burgers or sandwiches don't come with fries so you have to pay extra for that. Their beer prices were also crazy high, even for an airport bar. I had the pulled pork which was extremely runny and made the bun soggy. Never going back."}
{"text":"Do not come to this place unless you are willing to get a $70 hole in your wallet and maybe even more. Get your food somewhere else and sit here for the beer. The portions are meager and certainly not worth the price that you pay for. The food is not bad, but is still not worth the money. The service is the only thing that is good. Takes a while to get the food, and if you don't have a lot of time before your plane takes off, then you will be SCREWED. The food is plain and boring. Nothing special, just burgers and fries. You might as well go to your plane and get a bag of peanuts. It's just as bad.  The plates look like bowls, so you think you are getting a lot of food, but you aren't. Don't believe the Symon hype. This is NOT a gourmet or modern or foodie or fusion or even tasty, just as yummy as a SevenEleven gas station. There are many better places. Where else will you buy a simple salad in a tea cup for $8.00? Good luck. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Good Fries and decent wine! A good spot in an airport with electrical outlets at the bar. I'll rave on those things every time. Good stuff."}
{"text":"My flight was delayed so we stopped at Bar Symon for breakfast. Very good, classic breakfast and they did have a decent amount of choices for the time of day it was (5am, yikes!). Very quick and friendly service and the Bloody Mary helped pass the time until my flight!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, major points for having plugs at the bar. My beverage glasses were kept filled. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was very enjoyable. The chicken was cooked perfectly, very moist. It had Swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and an interesting addition of cilantro on griddled sourdough bread.  However, the fries were not what I was hoping for. They were closer to shoestring and the rosemary tasted burnt to the point where I wouldn't have known it was even rosemary had it not been identified on the menu. I did dip them in the coffee BBQ sauce and I must say that is an excellent sauce. The one thing I would do is add a brisket sandwich to the menu because to me, the coffee would suit beef more than it would pulled pork.  It's really the classic 3.5 star review. But I'll give it the fourth star for having the plugs."}
{"text":"I stood at the front, clearly looking at the carry-out menu. The server working today decided to ignore me--didn't even ask if I had any questions. Fast forward 10 minutes. She chooses to seat 3 parties of white customers and check on 4 tables of more white customers all while looking over at me waiting to be helped. It wasn't until I crossed my arms that a bartender came over and asked if she could take my order.  People often ask, \"Why does everything need to be made about race?\" This is why, folks. Intentional or not, serving white customers while clearly bypassing a person of color sends a message of systemic racism. I mean, how threatening can a brown dude in a dad hat look? Seriously. I just wanted to order my grilled cheese and go. The sad part? My grilled cheese came out cold. 'Twas a failed airport food adventure."}
{"text":"For airport food it's not bad. I stopped here for breakfast before my flight. It was a Friday morning around 8am and not busy. Service was great. I ordered the sourdough french toast and homestyle fries. I didn't prefer the sourdough bread, but it was ok. The fries were cooked perfectly.  The location was very central so it's easy to grab food then head to your flight."}
{"text":"Great service, I wish I remembered our bar tender's name but she was excellent. Warm, friendly and laid back like we were hanging out with a friend, but professional. Hard to come by.   I got the mac and cheese which was so good!"}
{"text":"Well, this was disappointing.  Overrated for sure.  First, these are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in at a restaurant.  The only reason I can think of as to why you would make sitting here such a bad experience is because you want to turn over tables quickly.  Mike, this is an airport: if I would rather sit for two hours by my gate than order drinks and sit in your restaurant, there is something wrong.  Next: did I really just pay $16 for a burger and fries?  Okay, I can see that if the food is exceptional, but this was not.  I ordered the exact same meal in a bar in Mt. Lebanon the day before and it was way better than this.  I had to use a fork on the burger about 1/4 of the way through it because it fell apart.  Not good and not worth the money.  Lola ketchup is not good.  Service was slow.  Everything went well until it was time to get the check, made worse by the fact that the chair was killing me.  I should not have to hold my credit card up in the air to get pay and get out.  This was my last visit here."}
{"text":"So, I've been told that people actually choose a lay-over in Pittsburgh just so they can eat at Bar Symon, so of course I was really excited that I had a flight due in around lunch time. The ambiance is fairly typical for an airport restaurant...one really nice plus is that it had TONS of outlets to charge devices between flights.  Being a craft beer fan, I was pumped to get a beer based on other reviews...unfortunately I was very disappointed with the selection. Nothing great...they even still had a few Christmas beers on. So I skipped the drinks.  For lunch I ordered the goat cheese mac and cheese because of a recommendation from the waiter and the French Onion Burger with a sunny side up egg. The food was really great. The mac and cheese was a half portion and still huge! Great flavor, probably would have enjoyed a smaller portion. The burger was OUTSTANDING. It had some banana pepper sauce that gave it a slight kick. Really fantastic meal. I walked away full and happy. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"A little late posting but.. better late than never! Stopped in New Years day and needless today I was tired and starving! I kept it simple veggie burger with regular fries! I'm picky about veggie burgers when I go out but knowing that chef Symons wife is a vegetarian I knew it wasn't going to be bad but in fact was fabulous! Not mushy flavorful and the bun was fantastic! I know the buns come from local bakery and they were great not too much bread. The fries were cooked just how I like them a nice crunch not greasy. I'll return when I'm flying back to the burgh!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! I had the French onion burger and rosemary fries. The service was attentive, the food took a little long but was delicious. I gave this place 4 stars for the seating. Cheaper tables and chairs. I liked that they had outlets close by so u could charge ur phone. I did not try the ketchup but I should have! I will be back!"}
{"text":"-gasp-! Airport food that I actually ENJOYED?! I was skeptical of patronizing this airport dining concept offered by famed Iron Chef Michael Symon, but after surveying our other airport options, we decided to give it a try. This casual gastropub-style restaurant in the Pittsburgh airport has it's hits and misses, but because of an awesomely curated all-craft beer draft list, I'm putting this place at a solid 4-stars.   Our burger was good; fluffy brioche bun, good quality meat, and all the fixin's. However, it was the mac n' cheese that really got my appetite going. Served hot in a cast-iron pan, this mac n'cheese was full of flavor with the added bacon and a great toasted crumb topping. Prices are fair, and given the fact that they had beers from Troeg's and Bell's (two of my favorite breweries), the meal was an overall win. If stuck in this airport, Bar Symon's not a bad place to kill some time. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"I come into Pittsburgh monthly on business so I anxiously awaited the opening of Bar Symon.  On the day I went in, it was incredibly busy which was a good sign for it.  I really didn't want a big meal, so I took one of the outside bar seats.  I was promptly waited on by the server - and then a second server came and was rather upset that someone else had \"stolen\" their table.   Really, not my problem.  I didn't want anything more than a snack so I found the menu a little problematic that way - I wanted to find some little nibbles, not a plate of sliders. So I opted for an order of Lola fries. They were piping hot little shoestring fries dusted with a little rosemary.  They were served upright in a small metal cup which meant that eating them was messy - there was no plate with them.  They were okay, nothing fantastic. I did have the chance to try the Lola ketchup (vinegary - meh, nothing like a ketchup).  The Coffee bbq was okay, again, nothing that knocked my socks off.  I don't drink so I asked for an iced tea.  My biggest peeve on iced tea is that it is weak so that when you add ice, it is nothing more than colored water.  And, unfortunately, that was the case here.  Doubt me on that?  Well.... the huffy server thought I was drinking water and couldn't tell it was tea when it was refill time. How sad is that.  The service leaves a lot to be desired.  The wait service didn't get any better.  Maybe b/c I was alone or not a big bill, the service was not great.  I was there an hour - and I got a refill 45 minutes into my stay.  The hostess was at the main entrance playing with her cell phone.  This is the first person that sets the stage for the rest of the meal.  Sad.  All in all, it was not worth the wait. Mildly disappointing. I might be tempted to try it again next trip to see if the meals are any better - perhaps he might have employed his co-worker Bobby Flay to come in and help him pre-opening to get the staff ready for their debut and teach them how to brew iced tea :)"}
{"text":"Okay, definitely love Michael symon, I've been to Lola, Lolita, and Bspot so many times in Cleveland.  I live in Pittsburgh, we have burgatory, brgr, and tessaros, but no bspot.  Imagine my astonishment as I went to the airport for my Florida vacation and say Michaels smiling face on a restaurant.  Needless to say, Symon continues to amaze me.  I had the pancakes and bacon, as it was breakfast. Bacon crisped perfectly and pancakes absolutely outstanding, just the right consistency, must have finished them off somehow, because the outside was crisp.  Absolutely amazing meal for an airport!  Michael, you sir will one day make me fat, but I'll never stop coming to your restaurants!"}
{"text":"This was a fine meal, but nothing memorable.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich. The breast was moist but, overall the sandwich did not stand out as anything special. It was comparable to something I could easily whip up at home. Chicken, guac, swiss cheese. The sandwich was 10 bucks ala carte, and I ordered some rosemary fries for 4.50. These seemed to me to comparable to McDonald fries with a little sprinkling of rosemary. I guess the rosemary was to justify the 4x markup. Certainly nothing wrong with the food, the service was competent -  but overall, this place did not impress me greatly - it was just fine."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but just ok in my book. I had pulled pork mac and cheese based on waitress recommendation and I thought it was just average. The noodles were under cooked and it had way to much salt for my taste. Oh well, it's airport fare,  I suppose I shouldn't expect too much."}
{"text":"Thank goodness it's not TGIFridays which has been running a torrid monopoly at PIT.  I'd not be surprised if the DoJ wan't involved in arranging a Cleveland chef to give us something, anything to relax upon while waiting for our aero-planes.  I always go for a Bell's Two-Hearted and a plate of cheese/bacon fries.  It let's you fall right to bed as you takeoff an hour later."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cobb Salad! Very fresh! Love the dressing! Great selection of fresh food! Friendly service and quick! (Important since this one is at the Pittsburg airport!) Good selection of draft beer and other cocktails!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my food here.  I got tomato soup and grilled cheese.  It was delightful.  I absolutely love the french fries as well.  It's more of a casual atmosphere, not the upscale atmosphere of Lola or even Lolita.  I can't really describe any place with \"pig decor\" as classy.  My biggest complaint about this place (besides the wait) is the price.  There really is no excuse for a grilled cheese sandwich over $10.  None the less, I'm the fool that paid for it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  If Michael Symon wasn't behind this place, people would probably never frequent it.  I think I'll wait for all the hype to die down and if they ever decide to be more affordable I'll go back.   Did I mention our waiter had those trendy jeans that have the worn spots.  Why were they worn out by his crotch?   Not what I want to see while I'm eating."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch before my flight.  Had the Big Blue salad with a burger patty on top.  Very good salad that was definitely large enough and well dressed including some avocado.  The patty was very tasty and cooked to a nice medium."}
{"text":"I cant say anything negative about this place. The food is always well prepared and tasty. The bar is outstanding breakfast, lunch or dinner. Mary Jo or Tee will always quench your thirst for a tasty beverage or conversation. That being said, the beer and drink selection is very nice and full of variety."}
{"text":"My coworker and I frequented this place for the past 8 weeks, and I finally feel like I can give an accurate assessment of it.   My favorites are the burgers specifically the French onion burger. It is cooked perfectly and I can never say no to caramelized onions!  As for sides the chips and guacamole are filling but the onion rings are to die for. Nothing special but that's what makes them special. Simple good old onion rings.  The French fries are also good. Get the gravy if you're gonna go for it, go hard or go home I always say! Pass on the Rosemary Parmesan because there's too much parm which makes it all too dry.   Overall it's a great spot for when you're passing through the Pittsburgh airport and need a place to eat. There are outlets at the bar and sprinkled around the rest of the place. If available, they're always willing to seat you near an outlet."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food.  One of the best airports for quality reasonably priced food is CLE and Simons is one of these spots!  The pirogies were plump and tender served with Nicky grilled kielbasa, grilled onions and mustard.  Yum!  The mustard was uniquely creamy and not too spicy.  For a heavy meal this was well done and not oily as it can be.  Thank you MS, another great dining spot for my list."}
{"text":"This was a real treat today.  For an airport restaurant I was blown away!  The arugula salad was great and if you add chicken and avocado it's just perfect.  Highly recommended at the CLE airport!"}
{"text":"I actually time my arrival to the Airport to eat at Bar Symon. Typically I arrive early to eat breakfast. Never disappointed. I have had the Bacon and Eggs, Breakfast Sandwich but my favorite dish is the Pancakes. 3 huge pancakes served with real maple syrup.  The staff is always great and they can get you in and out as quickly as you would like."}
{"text":"Returned to Bar Symon today for their Sunday Brunch.  None of the dishes we tried exemplified the magic that is Michael Symon.  I ordered the Belgian waffle with Nutella, bananas, and whipped cream with a side of hash browns (more \"hash\" than \"hash browns\").  The \"hash browns\" were rather flavorless, which is a shame.  Michael Symon is usually good at making the ordinary sing.  The Belgian waffle tasted exactly like it sounds.  No special \"something\".  It was a bit hard to taste the waffle underneath the Nutella...so for all I know, it was a waffle of the frozen variety (highly unlikely, but you never know...)  My boyfriend ordered the Pork Pastrami Hash (poached eggs, red peppers, onions, pepper gravy).  He liked it.  Again, I found it to be bland.  A few bites in, my boyfriend did as our waiter to bring over some hot sauce to add to his dish.  The potatoes were just very underseasoned, as with my side order.    Service was excellent.  Our waiter was quite friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  All in all, I don't think I'll write Bar Symon off as a brunch spot, but I'd have to try something more over-the-top next time."}
{"text":"I was very excited for the new Michael Symon restaurant.  However, Bar Symon was quite the disappointment.  My table shared the food of  mussels, fried brussel sprouts, the Clevelander, pastrami burger- \"voted #1 burger,\" according to the website, Lola fries, Guiness beer ice cream and pretzels, and apple bread pudding with bacon.  The best part of the meal was the Lola fries, Guiness beer ice cream, kielbasa, and brussel sprouts.  Half of the things I liked were from his menus at Lola and Lolita.  The Clevelander was roughly 14.00 for mediocre saurkraut, 2 kielbasa links, and 4 perogies.  The perogies were like the Mrs. T's perogies that you can buy frozen at the grocery store.  The best part of the dish were the kielbasa links, which weren't exceptional.  The #1 burger isn't really number 1, you can get a burger just as good if not better at Five Guys.  The mussels were cooked in a beer and created a slightly bitter flavor in your mouth.  The brussel sprouts were very good with a crispy outer coating. The apple bacon bread pudding sounds much better in theory than executed.  The bread pudding was bland and the bacon was really chewy and it doesn't do a good job of meshing together like the Maple Bacon Ice cream at Lola.  The Guiness beer ice cream is not to miss as the deep rich flavors of the dark beer come out and are enhanced with the salty pretzel bits.  It isnt as severely priced as Lola, but definitely not worth as much as we paid for our meal.  They have a really good selection of beers to choose from.   Overall, this restaurant lacks the magic touch of Michael Symon's other restaurants.  It seems as if he had not put any creative thought or impact on the dishes created.  Perhaps the restaurant is paying him to use his name and are making their own dishes or maybe he is losing his touch.  I see plenty of dishes that are inspired by his other offerings at Lola- showing lack of creativity.  If you really want Michael Symon- best place is Lola or Lolita don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Michael....you could do so much better.  My salad was stuffed into a bowl that was a size too small, allowing most of the greens to be tossed about the table each time I worked for a bite....  not mention it was sopping with dressing.  My tomato soup had the tell-tale signs of the microwave ring marks around the top of the bowl.  It seems like these are such easy fixes.  I look forward to my next trip through PIT, and I'll give Michael another try...and anticipating some improvements...."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and everything I have gotten has been really good. Today I ordered the ceasar salad with chicken. It was delicious! The only reason why I wouldn't give this place 5 stars is the fact that the service is actually a little slow. For an airport restaurant they should be speedier. I will be back though Im sure because I haven't found anything bad on the menu yet."}
{"text":"Am I really in an airport right now? Bar Symon is the best airport restaurant I've stumbled upon. We had a 4 hour layover and after a miserable experience in the US Airways Club, we stumbled into here and were pleasantly surprised! The staff was attentive and quick. All the seats at the bar had their own power outlets and they had a very impressive beer selection. We weren't planning on getting food, but holy cow, one glance at the menu and we knew we had to try something. Everything looked unique and delicious. I'm still kicking myself for not trying one of the baked mac n cheese dishes. However, we did order the guacamole which comes with homemade potato chips and has bacon and blue cheese inside of the guac. So good. And a great portion of it as well. Some of the brews we had were: Victory Golden Monkey, Troegs DreamWeaver Wheat and the Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold. A great find in an airport and a far cry from the basic Bud Light and burger selections."}
{"text":"meh.  Expected better.  It was still good, the sausage platter was enjoyable but not impressive (lamb was dry).  Ordered the artic charr which was a nice flavorful piece, however was served sitting in at least 1.5 tbsp of oil.  The side order of fries were mushy and limp.  I enjoy going to his other restaurants, but have noticed that aside from the decline in the quality of food, the wait staff is getting more and more snooty.  Since Bar Symon is supposed to be a casual joint, I woulda figured the wait staff would be a little bit more jovial and chill... but sadly no.     Im tempted to give it a 4 because of the beer list, and will likely be back for that same reason, but not the food."}
{"text":"Ordered porky fries to go, just ok but willing to give this iron chef another shot. Wasnt as hungry otherwise would have tried a proper entree.  Take out not ideal for french fries, which ended up pretty soggy from cheese sauce. Shredded pork was normal and the jalapenos looked like they came from jar/can and not freshly prepared."}
{"text":"After reviewing the menu, I did not eat here. Cute diner feel and TVs for watching news and sports.   But for being a top chef, Symon's menu is a major letdown. Incredibly basic and boring: burgers and fries. Sad that his restaurant is not even close to the most creative in the airport."}
{"text":"This is one of the better airport restaurants I've visited, and we fly...a lot lately.   Actually, Delta had some type of overbooking/storms/plane broke debacle and they gave us vouchers (60$!)  to hush our whining and the rep recommended this place.  We ordered a cheeseburger, fries, chicken and goat cheese mac and a salad.  The Mac and cheese was RICH, share that if you order one.  The fries were just okay.  I think the salad was the best thing we had.  Well,  besides the three 12$ Absolute shots he ordered... airport priced drinks and food for sure.    Service was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Was flying back home for a visit to PBurgh. Stopped here for breakfast on the way back to Seattle. Nice thing was they were open early, and it was real food. Traditional eggs and bacon were to die for. Anytime we are in town we will be eating there."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after my flight landed from DC as I was not sure what I would find at my nearby hotel in terms of dining options. Since it was just me, I opted to sit at the bar and was promptly greeted and welcomed by Tee. They have at least eight beers on tap albeit most of them are IPAs as pointed out by a non IPA lover at the bar. I picked one anyway with an interesting handle as I don't usually get an IPA nor am familiar with too many of them. It worked out well when paired with the french onion burger I ordered. This was one messy but tasty burger with fried onion bits serverd with it. In lieu of fries, I opted for a house salad that had a tasty Italian dressing. Everything was fresh and delicious. I was a little shocked by the price of my $10.59 20oz beer though once the bill came and should have inquired up front about prices."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm actually reviewing an airport restaurant!  Bar Symon is as good as it gets for airport food. The perfect ending to my business trip in Pittsburgh. The Fat Doug burger was just the perfect size, the bun was extraordinary.  The Lola Poutine fries were crispy yet delicious with all that gravy/sauce they had. Crispy chicken wings were divine - and really great you can add on the coffee BBQ sauce or dip into a mild hot sauce and blue cheese. And last but not least...finally... beanless chili - yummy! Because not everyone likes beans in their chili.  Highly recommend people to stop by and eat here if you have some time before your flight!"}
{"text":"Airport food is always suspicious, and as frequent flyer I am sometimes forced to take a chance. Bar Symon is located in the central food court of the Pittsburgh airport. Ordered the Pierogi sandwich with sausage and there Rosemary fries. The food was good, considering it's in the Airport. Not sure if I will go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow.  I wish I connected in PIT more often.  Now, I'm giving this 5-stars for an airport restaurant.  It was a nice change from the TGI Fridays and Chilis Toos of the airports of the US.  I enjoyed my burger and the salad was good too.  I guess the burgers are priced a la carte but the server will ask you if you would like fries or a salad."}
{"text":"It's an airport but I'm really enjoying my Tomato & Blue Cheese soup while waiting for my flight back home. The Pirates are on the TV and the music is just my style. There are plenty of outlets for charging those power hungry phones.  This place has become a tradition for me on my pilgrimages back home.  The only thing that would make this place better would be if they served their food with local pottery.  Homer Laughlin and Hall China are within 35 miles of this airport and I was disappointed to see that they used imported china at Bar Symon."}
{"text":"I must say if agree 100% with the negative reviews.  Maybe if my expectations wouldn't be so high for an \"Iron Chef's\" restaurant.  Got the \"Gobbler\" turkey burger recommended by the hostess and cheese / bacon fries.    Turkey burger was dry and lacked flavor.  Although somewhat masked by the spicy mayo the burger was just ok at best.  This brings us to the fries with Cheese Gravy and Bacon.  Again huge disappointment as the fries are straight from the bag frozen shoestring fries.  Then covered in a cheddar sauce which wasn't too bad except the sauce soaks into the fries and makes them mushy and downright unpleasant texture.  The best thing I had was the mango sorbet.  This was light and refreshing with good flavor.  The other \"nice\" thing was I was able to use REAL silverware.  Rare in terms of Airport food.  2 words describe this food \"Below Average\"."}
{"text":"Food was not that impressive or tasty for that matter. It's very disappointing. I ordered a Lola burger with a fired egg and only came with pickled onion which was just sour tasting pickled vegetable nothing special in this case I would rather have regular pickle. Onion rings and pulled pork sandwich tasted like microwave food. Shame on being a TV chef."}
{"text":"5 stars for their Chocolate & coffee flavored shakes. Probably the best I've ever had--like an upscale diner.   Have also enjoyed their beanless chili with cheese, sour cream & chive toppings--it was meaty and delicious. Can't pass it up every time I go to the airport. Tried the grilled cheese but it was nothin' that special. Service is hit or miss. I once complained about being negelected by a really rude waitress, and they comped my meal, which was nice. Since that time, service has been great."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food and speedy service in a clean and attractive setting! Today's treat was the house made guacamole and chips- would have been super happy with either alone- together was really enjoyable"}
{"text":"I'd probably really give this place 3.5 stars.  Finally had time to stop here before a flight and glad I got to try it.  I had a burger (juicy) and the rosemary fries which were crunchy and delicious but didn't really taste the rosemary.  Appreciated that they had plugs/charging stations at every table and bar stool so you could charge your phone/tablet/whatever while you ate."}
{"text":"Was awesome felt like home for me great good just like I was in my homestead on LA, nice job crew members of B S"}
{"text":"Great grilled cheese burger  and fresh salad. Rikky was my server and amazing service. Who would have thought airport has good food and great service. I am frequent traveler and do not like to write reviews unless i am happy with service."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good food. Ridiculously great staff. Pulled pork Mac and cheese (half portion is PLENTY) and a beer flight. Absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised to enjoy Bar Symon so much! It was exciting to me when this opened (and became a priority pass lounge in the airport so $28/person is covered if you have priority pass!) and it didn't disappoint. This is hands down the best airport food in CLE and one of the best airport restaurants I've been at.  The beer and cocktail options are quite varied, and the prices (while airport pricing) are not too bad with beers around $7-$9 and cocktails maybe around $13. Try Michael's Mule!  There were also a surprising number of vegetarian options and while I was skeptical of getting just a salad, the chickpea salad was huge and very filling.   I'm looking forward to my next visit to CLE so I can visit again!"}
{"text":"Worst wait. I travel at this airport 2 times a week and have been here several times. Usual wait for food is 45 minutes and with wait for food so long had to take my food to go three times. Food average, last week ordered a burger (again after 50 minutes ended up having to take it to go), bun was flaking off on top (old)  and burger way overcooked. I have given this place several chances because I wanted to like it but after 200 dollars spent and never a good experience I will not go back."}
{"text":"One of the better airport eateries I have visited.  I went with the cobb salad which was large and came with grilled chicken, avocado, Applewood bacon, hardboiled egg, blue cheese, walnuts and tomatoes. There was a light vinaigrette which did not overpower the salad. It had plenty of flavor and was reasonably priced.  Service was very attentive and they also have free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"So happy this place is in the airport!  My husband and I stopped in before a flight. He had the turkey Reuben and I had the Cobb salad. I substituted the red wine vinegar dressing instead of the dressing it comes with and we shared pork fries. Everything was fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Ordered the arugula salad with a medium burger, the salad came out very salty and the burger was fried to a crisp. The bartender saw that it was way over cooked and ordered another one. The second one came out worse and I had too wait another 10mins. ..soo 20 mins later still had an aweful meal....and the salad had a twig and weed mixed in, i guess for extra fiber. The manager was no where to be found so the bartender couldn't take back the salad, but gave me a beer instead. Great place for beer before your flight,  but bypass the food...just as I was leaving the manager came back and he was able to remove the salad, said there was a new line cook and he was still learning"}
{"text":"This is some of the best airport food there is.  I've not had everything on the menu, but I will tell you the Tomato & Blue Cheese Soup is excellent.  (There's a lump of blue, right in the middle, and it's kind of melted and a bit golden on top, so they've run it through the broiler.  Don't stir it in, just grab little bits of it with each spoon full.)  They've got some solid salads, lots of starters (potato chips with blue cheese are great), and some funky mac & cheese selections.  If you're in PIT airport, go for it."}
{"text":"Yum. My new staple at the Pittsburgh airport. Leave time before your flight to stop in. Also? They have a departure board above the bar, with a great selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I stopped into Bar Symon for a bite before catching my flight. They were crowded but I was able to be seated quickly. The wait staff was attentive and was able to place my order quickly. The food came out in a timely manner and was hot. My burger was cooked properly, and tasted delicious. The rosemary fries were seasoned well and not to over powering."}
{"text":"This is better than any airport restaurant I have ever been to.  I will list my criteria below: 1). Good food 2). Great mayo 3). Wait staff that brings 1 and 2 every 5 min or so  Bar Symon hit the trifecta and as such gets a 5 star rating from me. Also, order bacon cheddar fries, side of mayo.  I did and ate them on the plane.  The man in 3c looked like he was going to mug me for some of them.  He wasn't quick enough as I devoured them before we were over Akron."}
{"text":"I love Bar Symon at PIT. I ate here for the third time today, and I thought they totally deserve a shout out. I have had their Roman (their version of Caesar) with grilled chicken three times. It's the best grilled chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. It's fresh, juicy, and has this beautiful char. They are a tad heavy on the garlic croutons, but it's a wonderful salad nevertheless! Substantial but not too filling. My husband has loved both the ground lamb mac and cheese and the pulled pork mac and cheese. I have spent several hours here every time. Free and fast wifi, and friendly service. I just wonder why they don't play the Chew though at 1pm (they had sports and court shows during that time)! Oh, and my husband and I both enjoyed their cocktails."}
{"text":"Looks very cheap from the outside from the terminal but I guarantee you the food is fantastic. It is really the only full service restaurants at the Pittsburgh airport. I had the chickpea salad with grilled chicken on top and it was unbelievable. The menu is full of different burgers and other unhealthy stuff but this salad was extremely healthy. It was fresh and the chicken was seasoned really well."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here if you're looking for a quick refreshment before a flight. There's nothing quick here. 10 minutes after ordering a glass of wine, it was delivered. Guacamole with house made chips (half soggy chips because the potato slices weren't separated before putting in the deep fryer) - took over an hour from sitting at the counter til I got my check which I had to request from a different server. Billy - my server - just disappeared!!  Good for people watching from the counter. That's about all that's good. Michael Symon - I think you took your eye off the ball here."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious food, especially for airport food. We had a little extra time before we boarded our plane so we decided to stop and eat here, rather than getting a fast food option like subway or mcdonalds. We really liked our meals. My turkey sandwich was delicious- mustard, avocado, garlic, bacon it was super filling and super good. I also ordered the rosemary fries which were decent- not a ton of rosemary flavor and they were really small (shoestring fries). The service was great, they were very quick and we were in and out under an hour. I could only eat half of my sandwich since it was so filling, they were able to wrap the other half in foil so I could bring it on my flight with me. We had a very good experience here and I will keep them in mind next time we are hungry at the airport."}
{"text":"My flight was delayed today, and I'm kind of glad because I got to try out Bar Symon. I'm usually skeptical of Celebrity Restaurants, but I figured that since this is Michael's home turf, he'd make sure it was good.  The atmosphere is clean, bright and lively (a little on the loud side). The service was attentive, friendly, and fast. I tried the Polish Boy with a small side salad. This was my first time trying this sandwich and wow, am I glad that I did. Turns out that it's true that this is a really messy sandwich to eat. To the uninitiated, a Polish Boy is a Cleveland specialty that consists of a hot dog roll, a polish sausage, topped with French Fries, cole slaw, and a special mustard based sauce. It doesn't sound really appealing, but give it a try with some of their hot sauce.   Finally, a decent place to eat at the airport!"}
{"text":"Ok disclaimer, they are getting four stars because they had bubbles at the bar.  Food was good as well.  I don't expect much from airport food, but this surprised me as I didn't know this place.  Our server Sarah was nice and greeted us with a smile.  She was attentive but didn't rush us.  We started with the Crispy Chicken Wings with the dry rub ($13.99).  They came with the standard blue cheese dressing & celery sticks.  Good solid flavor, with the dry rub not being overwhelming or salty.  Not a lot of heat in the flavor, but that was perfect for me as I don't do hot.  For entrees I got the Gobbler (turkey burger, guacamole, romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion, swiss cheese on a challah bun) which came with a house made sriracha mayonnaise, but I asked to not have that on the burger.  Burger was nice and juicy.  It came with the rosemary fries, which I loved, but I could see people who are not a fan of rosemary not liking these as the flavor really popped.  Dr M got the Pulled Pork (Michael's coffee BBQ sauce, coleslaw & dill pickles on a challah bun).  It was a monster sandwich and the pork was tender and pulled fine.  There was plenty of meat on the sandwich, so Dr M had to knife and fork this sandwich.  The co-mingling of meat, coffee BBQ sauce and coleslaw was great.  While there was nothing wrong with the turkey burger, this sandwich was totally delish.  For an airport restaurant, the food was good and fast, but not rushed.  When are you coming to O'Hare Iron Chef Symon?"}
{"text":"Cool little spot to kill time before a flight. Our server was very attentive and the food was awesome! We had burgers, parmesan fries, onion rings, and wings. Everything was perfectly cooked, but the wings really stood out - they were extra crispy outside and juicy inside. Stop by if you've got time; it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great early morning airport bar to grab a bite to eat or a drink before taking off. I always grab the Rosemary Honey Greyhound breakfast specialty mixed drink super tasty and hit's the spot. The female bar tender in the morning is always super nice on top. I never had an issue here and it's my go to spot when flying out of Pittsburgh. Seating is plentiful and 5 star's is given where it is deserved on the bar a lone. Remember time does not exist when flying drinks can be served at any time and that includes 5:30 AM :-)"}
{"text":"Arrived at the airport early and decided a burger was in the cards.  Burger was excellent.  Fresh ingredients and prepared as ordered.  Pretty pricy though...$11. For a  bacon cheese burger only...not even a slice of orange or a pickle on side.  Fries are a la carte and start at $4.49 for Rosemary Fries.  There are other specialty fries that are more expensive, that seem like a meal.  Would I stop there again....hmmm not sure.  Although good food...felt it missed the mark on value."}
{"text":"As far as a airport restaurant goes, it wan't too bad. I was there super early in the morning, everything I attempted to order for breakfast had to altered because they were out of something. I finally settled on the sourdough french toast made with white bread because they were out of sour dough and with sryup only because they were out of the strawberry topping.  The menu is extremely limited so I don't understand how they could be out of almost everything. My french toast was good but it left me wondering if it could have been better."}
{"text":"I am debating on monthly buying a cheap spirit round trip ticket to Pittsburgh to fly in eat and leave all in the same day!! What we ate was absolutely amazing!! Looking forward to more next time... FYI Micheal Symon build one in Mansfield Texas PLEASE!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness we found Bar Symon after basically being ignored at The Burgh just down the hall at Pittsburgh's airport. We were seated immediately by a friendly hostess. Our server came right over and introduced herself. She was great, way above average. She was young, enthusiastic without seeming fake, efficient and funny. What a pleasure.  The food was very good, a step above what you ordinarily expect at the airport. I got a basic grilled cheese sandwich. The bf got an excellent pastrami sandwich. We shared a huge side of Parmesan rosemary fries.  They have a nice selection of beers, and service was fast enough you didn't have to get anxious about missing a flight.   Oh--there were also electrical plugs EVERYWHERE, under each bench along the wall, and at all of the hightops facing the terminal. Good thinking, and we were able to recharge while we ate. I don't know what more you need in an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Thank God for great food at an airport.  Actually world class food! As a transplanted Clevelander I have been a fan of \"Iron Chef\" Michael Symon's food for years including Lola, Lolita, BSpot and for the adults in the room The Caxton Cafe. This newly opened restaurant has a very cool vibe with casual comfortable and ample seating in a wide open space right in the center food court area (look left as you come up the escalators from the tram).  The food is classic Symon-Amazing Burgers-super juicy with toppings like pastrami, fried eggs, think cut applewood smoked bacon...yum.  Try the coffee BBQ sauce (at every table right next to the ketchup) it is to-die-for! They also offer a great assortment of gourmet Mac and Cheese alternatives that are so satisfying. Of course no meal is complete without the rosemary fries.  If you've never had them I insist you try them.  So tasty.  They also offer breakfast for early morning flights.   As good as the food is -as a sometime road warrior-- I have to say some of the design elements really blew me away.  There is an outlet at EVERY SEAT AT THE DINING COUNTER! (yay!) There are also plenty of outlets at the booths too! No more sitting on the floor near your gate charging your phone!  Also brilliant is the inclusion of a flight monitor RIGHT IN THE BAR! So you can charge your phone, eat gourmet food and no exactly how delayed your flight out is going to be and when boarding is going to begin.    Finally, the perfect restaurant for the weary, hungry road warrior.  Thank you Michael Symon!"}
{"text":"5 stars might be overly generous, but I defy you find a better pulled pork sandwich anywhere, let alone an airport. A lot of good burger options brought over from the B Spot menu. It's a Michael Symon restaurant, just in an airport, unlike Wolfgang Puck's crappy pizza place in the Chicago airport."}
{"text":"Stopped here for the best craft beer at PIT Airport. Sean was amazing!!! Despite being very busy she took time to care personally for each customer. The food was great"}
{"text":"So wish this place was good.  I've been multiple times for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Come for the celebrity chef name and leave with disappointment.  Food is mediocre.  Maybe wouldn't judge so harshly if it wasn't represented by a celebrity chef.  But truly, mediocre food but reasonably priced for an airport."}
{"text":"Very disappointing for something baring the Symon name. While I realize \"airport food\" is generally over priced and underwhelming, I expected more from this spot. For $20 I had a soggy arugula salad and cold poorly flavored fries that were marketed as Rosemary fries. The only stars here were for the service. While I appreciate the idea it would be nice if location made a greater effort to live up to its name."}
{"text":"well below the standard of symons other restaurants and kind of an embarrassment to his brand. i had the cheddar mac which was mostly just bland. my dad had a burger with egg. the egg was totally hardcooked and the bacon was nearly raw.  the issue with poor quality control in an airport setting is that there is no time to send the food back so you are kind of stuck with what you get the first time around. in this case it will be my last time around."}
{"text":"Expected way better food and service. I have to say that I've had meals here before and it used to be good, food and service has gone downhill, my sandwich was cold and my fries too, I let the server know and she took it back and they warmed my sandwich up instead of replacing it, service also took very long inspite of the restaurant being empty, not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"If ur in the Pittsburgh airport this is a must stop, especially for the burgers!  You will not be disappointed, cannot go thru Pittsburgh w/out stopping and trying something different.  Definitely has the feel of Chef Michael..."}
{"text":"For what it is, an airport restaurant, this place is really kinda perfect.  I had the French Onion burger - tasted like really high quality beef, topped with Gruyere and a mess of sautéed onions. Delicious.   In general I'm not a huge beer fan but I wanted three of the eight beers they had on tap.  Had a Yeungling on tap, because Pittsburgh. Also had a Black Butte Porter on tap because delicious. They even had Rogue Dead Guy on tap!   4 HDTVs at the bar, three on sports, one scrolling the departures board, outlets at every booth and bar seat.   This place really fired on all cylinders.  No doubt where I'll eat next time flying out of PIT.   Next time I'll get one of the offerings from the mac'n'cheese menu.    They also have some poutines, so it could be a heavy meal!"}
{"text":"Oh Michael how you should not have you name on an airport bar!  I love your shows but this was horrible. The simple salad was just that. Romain lettuce with some cucumbers and a few tomatoes and completely over dressed  The smoked turkey sandwich I was expecting fresh sliced turkey instead I got deli meat that was no better than my local market. I should have gotten a sandwich at the boars head deli before passing through security. At least I know the quality of the deli meat there.   Just not what I expected. I read the bad reviews and decided to form my own opinion..... Next time ill stop at the deli downstairs."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the \"gluten free\" items on this menu. They are NOT gluten free and are fried with breaded items. The waitress had no allergen info for me, no labels for the balsamic vinaigrette (even though it was not made in house), and had no idea about the menu whatsoever. They use soybean oil for frying, so those with allergies, beware. I would not recommend this place to anyone, mainly due to the bad service. Do not dine here with any food allergies."}
{"text":"If you ever have the opportunity to eat out before you get to the airport, I would recommend a number of Pittsburgh restaurants before this one-however, this is definitely one of the better airport bars I have been to . Great beer selection that represents local and solid Midwest breweries( Bells, Great Lakes and East End) and a solid selection of Sandwich and entre options. If you want to pig out there are amazing looking artery clogging burgers with big cuts of bacon, BBQ and specialty mac and cheese. I ended up going with an overpriced California type chicken sandwich that ended up being being better than I expected. If I had time to kill in the Pittsburgh airport- this would be the only place I'd recommend. Way better than the last joint they had here. The breakfast and rosemary fries looked pretty good too."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give almost any restaurant in an airport 4 stars, but Bar Symon is really quite good.  Everything has a little surprise either in seasoning or ingredients or just in knock you down indulgence (Polish Boy is highly recommended for a big appetite).  There isn't much good going on at PIT, but this is a good stop between flights."}
{"text":"Most airport restaurants are kind of bland, average and boring. Bar Symon goes a little further to make memorable American classics. Hell, they serve Bells Two Hearted Ale. At the AIRPORT. That's really all I need to get away from the standard Miller Light, Heineken, Sam Adams and Budweiser stuff that most airport restaurants sell.  I had the bacon cheeseburger and the rosemary fries. All very good. The service was a little inattentive when I didn't make my order right away but who cares. If I'm ever back at the Pittsburgh airport, I'm coming here again."}
{"text":"It's a restaurant in an airport. In my opinion, this types of places just generally aren't as good because of that fact. They are serving travelers in a hurry. Fries, which is supposed to be a specialty, were just ok. The Parmesan cheese was like grated out of the \"green canister\" you can buy at your grocery. Too much of it was on the fries. Would be way better with some freshly grated Parmesan. Had the bbq pork sandwich and it was ok too. They are known for their burgers and baked mac n cheese. So maybe I should have splurged for one of those options. Service was great. Friend had the bologna sandwich--looked good and he said it was good."}
{"text":"We got pierogies $7.99, fries with sausage gravy $6.99, and pulled pork Mac and cheese half size $6.99. Fries with gravy was like poutine but even better! So delicious. Mac and cheese was great. A little spicy but no complaints. If you like Mac and cheese and pork, you got it made in the shade.  Let's talk pierogies. For 8 bucks, you get 3 tiny pierogies, and 3 tiny pieces of sausage. It was a total joke. Especially for that price, this is Pittsburgh-pierogi central. Get it together, Symon.  Beer was fine, but beer is beer when there isn't much to choose from."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that Michael Symon would allow his name to be associated with this restaurant. The hostess never greeted us, but did yell at us when, after waiting for a minute, we decided to seat ourselves. Despite a decent list of beer on draft, none were available. Apparently, the taps hadn't worked all week. The burger was expensive and completely average, and the $4 salad was an overdressed cup of romaine with a few slices of cucumber and 3 grape tomatoes. For over $40, I expected much more."}
{"text":"Went last night (Tuesday) for dinner around 630 with my wife for her birthday. Only had to wait about 15 minutes, which was the perfect amount of time to have a pre-dinner cocktail at the bar.  We started with the kielbasa, which was served with mustards, grilled bread and some vegetables. My wife had the mussels and I had the smoked pork butt. Each was absolutely delicious in its own way. And when the waiter recommended he bring over another small loaf of the bread to dip in the mussel \"goodness\" before we sent our dishes away to be cleaned, we happily agreed.  Overall, it was the best meal and dining experience we've had in Cleveland since relocating back to the area last October. Love the open dining room and wood & metal textures throughout. Food was delicious, beer selection plentiful and wait staff super attentive."}
{"text":"This place is located downtown and in the airport! I went to the airport location because they accept Priority Pass members and give you a free $28 voucher and we were coming home from a long weekend getaway.  We ordered the crispy chicken wings, fat boy Burger and fries. They all were soooo savory! The service is good, and it's located in concourse C. I would recommend it this restaurant if you are hungry and in the mood for good bar food or even a tasty salad!"}
{"text":"Here I sit drinking a fine Kraft beer enjoying the atmosphere and food.  For starters I had the Tomato & Blue Cheeses soup.  This is very thick and chunky, not creamy.  Kind of like spaghetti sauce.   My taste would have preferred more blue cheese and cream.  It was tasty but not my preference.  The server called it \"bisque like\".   But I disagreed, it is up to the chef to interpret the meaning of bisque.    Hello Mac & Cheese!   So many choices, so little time.  I went with the pulled pork +jalepinos.  Add their coffee BBQ and holy crap - home run!!!!  Some many things I wanted, Lola fries, fried bologna sandwich ---- a few different burgers - so much!!!   Much better change from my PITT stop across at TGIF.    By the way ALL the staff is 5 star."}
{"text":"For an airport bar, this place is one of my faves.   The decor is industrial, which really isn't my thing, but it somehow all works for me.  Of course, the giant photo of smiling cutie Michael Symon probably helps.     On this occasion, I sat at the bar for about 3 hours - watching the football game and drinking wine.   The bartender, Tee, was super-friendly and attentive.  When I pulled out an iPad, he quickly mentioned that there are accessible plugs under the bar and free WIFI (both much appreciated in an airport).   He also recommended my dinner (the Gobbler) and pointed out that burgers are a la carte (which basically means that the fries are extra).  I actually thought the turkey burger was dry, but it was flavorful and spicy, which I liked.   I do wish I had gotten the fries (I was pretending to be healthy at the moment of ordering).  They looked amazing.   There was also a cobb salad down the bar that looked great too.     Value is lacking, of course, but that is to be expected in any airport restaurant.  I will say, though, that the 9 oz. wine pour is worth the $10.   I have also tried the breakfast here (a burrito as I recall).  It was delicious with house made ketchup and crispy potatoes.   I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's rare that I have a decent airport meal. I had he Cobb salad with chicken, and the chicken was perfectly cooked. It's rare I can say that about any restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the burger and I can't think of a burger that compares with a burger from BarSymon.  Beer and fries were delicious and went with the burger perfectly.  Electric plugs everywhere which is great when dinning in an airport.  A must stop every time I'm at PIT."}
{"text":"Loved the French onion burger (the sauce is a banana pepper sauce) and the fries are very very generous.  Great meal."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, quality, tasty ...  What more do you want in an airport diner?  Yes, they have a bar too. A little pricey, but did I mention fast, friendly, quality and tasty?"}
{"text":"Cool menu w/ different variety and good beer on tap.  It's a nice alternative to the TGI Friday's.    Also, if you're ever in Pittsburgh's airport look for the alternative security line.  They won't tell you about it but it's a time saver. 2nd floor."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast. There are plenty of outlets for charging your phone at your table and the service is quick, which is great for an airport restaurant when people are needing to get out and go.   The food was really good, too. I wanted to order the pulled pork burrito because it sounded pretty interesting but the waiter was nice enough to wince and give me that look like \"uh maybe go with something else.\" So instead I ordered the omelette, which was stuffed with bacon (thick cut!), tomatoes, avocado, and arugula and then I added feta since it oddly doesn't come with cheese already. The feta was a great addition that the waiter suggested, no extra charge. The omelette came with tasty rosemary, Parmesan home fries (country breakfast potatoes) and your choice of toast.  It's owned by Michael Symon from The Chew and famous James Beard award winner. Pretty cool. Overall, it was a good breakfast experience for an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Airport setting, so pretty decent fare in that regard. I tangled with the Biscuits & Gravy. Pretty tasty with a nice level of spice, coupled with two thick slabs of bacon, and over easy eggs, however a wobbly table caused its problems as each cut into the slices of bacon resulted in repeated spills of our coffee.  A periodic check of table & chair casters wouldn't hurt.  On the service side, kudos & 5 stars to Ariel, a rookie bar tender, who poured a very nice barrel aged Manhattan. Not a typical morning beverage for me, however they use Amaro in the recipe. Being a Manhattan snob, I had to give it a try and it was delightful.   The true star at this establishment was our server, Michelle, a 5+ or more if I could rate higher. Charming, witty, and as customer satisfaction oriented as any server I have  ever \"met\".  She's has game, making an often trying eating at an airport experience a very pleasant one. Bravo, Bravo!!"}
{"text":"We ordered some food from this place. The order was 'to go'. When we checked later, an item was missing. I trusted them with the items on the list and since the order was 'to go' I didn't open each an every item to check as I had a flight to catch as well. However while placing the order i had asked them to repeat it twice and the missing item was in there at that time. The food however was good but I am deducting points since my order was incomplete."}
{"text":"It's an airport, so you have to expect the food quality to be a few notches below the rest of the world. That said, the pulled pork fries were alright and the beer selection was enough to make me smile!    I would've gone with 3 stars but I was extremely pleased with the abundance of power outlets and the spectacular service I received.  The server was prompt, attentive, and I was extremely impressed that she noticed my phone was on a call so she began doing \"silent follow ups\" to make sure my drink was full and that I didn't need anything.  Service: A++ Food: B- (but it's an airport so that's a pretty good grade)"}
{"text":"I agree with Nicole M. that the food was good, some of it very good, but not great. However, as far as the concept of bringing delicious comfort food to the masses on the west side, I think Bar Symon is a pretty good bet and worth a try - if you can get seated in a reasonable amount of time.   We went on a Friday night expecting a 90 minute wait. After about 20 minutes at the bar, a table for 3 *magically* surfaced. FYI, the wine list is very reasonably priced, but it's very heavy on the California bottles.   We were starving and needed something fast, so we started with the House Chips with Blue Cheese Fondue. Really tasty because the blue cheese is melted with something else to bring the intensity down. Next up were the Pork Belly Croutons. I think these were my favorite part of the meal because the pork was so flavorful without being overly heavy. The outside was crispy, the inside warm and chewy. Mmm.  I had the fried chicken. The honey and truffle was a nice spin on taste and the breading had a great thick texture that you could sorta pull off and eat on it's own. The quantity was also quite generous - I definitely took home a substantial doggie bag. My husband had the Friday Prime Rib special but didn't seem that enthused about it - I think he'd skip it next time.  Our waitress was amazing and very accommodating of some extra attention we needed, so the service must have cleaned up their act since some of the other reviewers have been. My only wish was that the food came out a little slower.  I'd like to give it another whirl when the menu changes."}
{"text":"Mid afternoon, too late for lunch but too early for dinner, I was dreading the 6-7 hour flight from Pittsburgh back to the west coast (headwinds were adding at least an hour to the trip). Needing a place to eat before being crammed into the southwest flying bus, I carefully examined my choices in the center X of the PIT airport. interestingly laid out, many of the primary restaurants are in the cross roads of the X, making your selection with a quick walk around the center of the X area. Having time to kill, I thought I would get some fuel in the tank and was happy to spot  what looked to be a gastropub type restaurant.  Yes I shamelessly watch the Food network, Hell's Kitchen, and all the spin off shows, etc. but honestly it did not dawn on me at first what the connection was here. I was so torqued up with work and dreading the flight, AHHH Bar Symon! the light bulb finally went off and I immediately stepped up to the hostess stand for a table. Cut to the chase, I ordered a salad, a refreshing crisp, oregano dressing and fresh lettuces. Simple but fresh, minus the chemical flavor you get sometimes from airport boxed salads. Rosemary and lamb \"mac and cheese\" hit the spot. More meat than cheese, but I think the description on the menu does it justice and you would not be mislead on the cheese part if you dialed in to that. The better part of a bottle of sangiovese went quite nicely. I might add they had a good selection of microbrews which I am totally into, just not before a long flight (in a window seat).     Downside, the waitress was cool with me but not as nice to an older couple sitting next to me.  Though they were extremely bossy and needy with their burgers it took  25 minutes for them to get it. Seriously I timed it. My food came out so fast (5 minutes for salad, 8 for pasta) and theirs was so slow, ordering just minutes apart, it made me wonder what the situation was in the kitchen.  One more comment. You can't miss all the cookbooks being hawked at the server / cashier stand. So as I was leaving, wine under the belt, I took a sec to flip thru the 2 Symon cookbooks for sale. Both advertised as \"personally signed,\" I looked thru every one to find the signature. I called this to the attendant's attention when I couldn't find his autograph. She said, \"oopsies, i've sold a lot this week and I guess none of them had the signature. hee hee.\" Great. So I bought one as an impulse gift buy and still have a bad taste in my mouth from that.        Postscript: Cookbook was a good read on the plane, and belly was full in a good way. Got home safely. Four stars for airport food and wine.       Second Postscript:  Shortly after I wrote this review, Bar Symon contacted me and replaced the cookbook with one that was actually autographed.  Because of the good follow up, I have raised my review to five stars.  Can't wait to visit again.    Thank you."}
{"text":"I haven't written many Yelp reviews (yet, at least), but it comes as strange coincidence that among my first six reviews will be The Publican in Chicago and Bar Symon, one exit down I-90 from where I live.  The resemblance between the two is uncanny and, I'm sure, not a coincidence in itself--similar meat centric menus with a wide selection of beers, similar pork rind appetizers, and even similar lighting fixtures (the spherical lights in a square pattern).  At Bar Symon, you won't get the banquet seating or stall-like tables nor is the restaurant as loud as The Publican.  The crowd consists of Cleveland West Siders as opposed to Chicago post-college.  Dinner started out with a Morimoto Soba Ale (I actually had been watching Iron Chef America just before heading out to the restaurant), warm olives, and pork rinds.  The pork rinds were about the same as The Publican (maybe slightly less spicy) which isn't saying much.  The warm olives were good, but if we're going that route, I'd probably prefer the French Breakfast Radishes at The Greenhouse Tavern on East 4th.  When we finally got to our table, we went with the DeuS--the same champagne beer I had at The Publican--which is always a treat and the bone marrow appetizer, which was decent, but, really, nothing is really added to the dish except for the fact that you're having bone marrow on a piece of toast.  I had the Pork Butt entree which came with pickled cabbage slaw, as well as a side of Bacon Creamed Corn.  The Pork Butt was juicy and delicious while the accompanying cabbage slaw was barely edible filler.  The Bacon Creamed Corn was fairly good, although whatever influence the bacon was supposed to have on the dish appeared to be lost--at least in my sample.  My friend ordered the Fried Chicken, which looked tasty but, wow, it was a lot of fried chicken!  For dessert, I went with an ice cream sandwich using banana bread, which was a bit too sweet, even for a dessert.  My friend ordered the beer ice cream with pretzels, which I've had before at Lolita, and is a solid dessert choice.  A tale of two restaurants:  In the end, I'm going to have to drop Bar Symon down to 2 stars because, really, The Publican is just a better restaurant in almost every regard--better food, better beer selection, etc.--hence, the appropriate \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  In reality, though, my expectations for Bar Symon were not nearly as high as those for The Publican.  And, really, can you find a better restaurant at an abandoned strip mall in Avon Lake?  Bar Symon only really needs to beat out the Quiznos, the BW3s, and the Wendy's to stay on top of its territory.  Unlike The Publican, I'd see myself returning to Bar Symon to enjoy a decent casual dining experience.  Two other points to add: 1. To the restaurant, DeuS is meant to be served in a flute, even the information booklet that comes with the bottle says so.  Read it and get it right next time!  2. For any and all my negative comments, if you're in a toss-up between Bar Cento and Bar Symon, go to Bar Symon."}
{"text":"I am writing with the assumption that most folks are eating here because they are flying someplace and not because they simply like to frequent mass transit locations in search of fine dining. This is an airport restaurant, but it is pretty good. The waitstaff was courteous and helpful. The beer selection was quite reasonable. My wife had the macaroni cheese with chicken that was actually pretty good; it wasn't overcooked, the cheese sauce was flavorful and well proportioned and the top was browned and crispy.  I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich that was very good. The bread was grilled and the sandwich was big enough for dinner; okay the tomato was not a lush heirloom but a crappy winter tomato. The price was about what I expect in an airport and the quality was definitely better."}
{"text":"Excellent place , even if it weren't in an airport.  Love love loved the rosemary fries, chick pea salad, and pierogis.  And Black Butte Porter on tap... OH YEAH!  We asked for mayo and were treated to regular and srirachi mayo, the latter of which was sensational with the fries.  Service was very good, though we weren't in a hurry.  The two servers clearly took pride in the place and even seemed to back each other up like a team."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because aside from having no complaints about my food or experience, this place is in an airport; it's very hard to come by this kind of good quality at an airport.    As Johnny N. mentioned, I was also equally impressed with the atmosphere, menu and staff. I sat down around 1:30pm on a Tuesday, and there was plenty of room at the high top table facing the bar for me. There is free wifi and power outlets available everywhere, which is greatly appreciated for not only a business traveler, but even when traveling for pleasure and wanting to keep your phone charged.   I wasn't in the mood for an alcoholic beverage, but their selection of craft beers on tap (Shock Top and Troegs is awesome to see), as well as a few specialty cocktails (love seeing homemade Bloody Mary mix on the menu) was much appreciated. I just wish I landed here when I WAS in the mood for a drink!  I just got a club soda with lime (thank you to my sweet server, Amy, for actually listening to me and bringing me a lime eloquently placed on a toothpick), and Amy was very attentive and polite, refreshing my beverage right as I was nearing the bottom.   I enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich, which was fresh and tasty, on very fresh, crusty sourdough bread with guac spread. Yum!  I'll definitely be back next time I'm at the Pittsburgh airport."}
{"text":"The bartender was super nice and attentive!!! I got a Fine & Shandy which was amazing. To eat, I got mac & cheese and fries with sausage gravy! Wow wow! Super good airport food!"}
{"text":"Love the taste of the food,   BUT  $10.5 1/3 lb burger no sides  $4.5 small side of plain fries  $11 for a beer.   $30??    FAIL.  Price value Tiny fries Crazy priced beer Not following \"mall\" prices per the local law  Awesome  taste of smokey flame grilled burger Room for luggage. (It is an airport!!)  Overall would I go back?    Eh...maybe?"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the food network and I love watching Michael Symon so I was pretty excited to try his 'new' restaurant.  My high hopes were dashed pretty quickly and unfortunately I have to give a bad review.   This might be a good place to stop for a beer while waiting for your flight but I don't recommend eating here.   This place doesn't beat out the other airport fare, which isn't saying much at all.  I ordered the grilled cheese which was fontina, roasted red peppers and arugula on sour dough.  I also ordered the tomato and blue cheese soup which sounded delicious and came recommended by the waitress.  The soup tasted like spaghetti sauce in a bowl.   No lie.   It was way too thick and I was left waiting to wonder when my side of pasta would be arriving.  If there was any blue cheese in this soup, I didn't taste it.  My grilled cheese wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.   The sourdough wasn't toasted on the outside and the roasted red peppers were cold and the cheese was luke warm.  I can't imagine the lunch we were served is representative of the Iron Chef.  P.S.   This underwhelming soup and sandwich set me back about $20 and it clearly wasn't worth that."}
{"text":"If you're vegetarian or vegan and the giant photo of the guy with the shirt that says \"EAT MORE MEAT\" wasn't enough to make you turn around, or (like me) you can't convince your travelling companions to go somewhere else, you're in for one of the worst meals of your life.  Everything is fried in animal fat, so no fries for you. You can't even much on the chips that go with the guacamole (I asked), so about the only thing you can eat is the veggie burger, which tastes like what they feed prisoners. The patties were the driest, most tasteless thing I've ever consumed; they crumbled into pieces on my plate at the slightest touch. I never thought I'd eat something that made me miss Boca burgers, but Bar Symon succeeded."}
{"text":"Food, wine, and beer were all very good.  Better than expected for an airport bar/restaurant.    We only had 21 minutes until boarding so we sat at the bar. Our server,  Tee, was the perfect bar tender/ server for this atmosphere.  Funny but not pushy, very helpful, realistic about what we could order and eat given our short time frame.  We had the chili and the arugula salad. Both were much better than you would typically find at an airport bar. If this was not in an airport I would be back and likely order the same.  Wine was good (Sangiovese) and beer was excellent (Yangling sp? ). Food was priced as you would expect for a restaurant outside of am airport.  Wine and beer were well-priced for an airport bar.  Tip - They have electrical plugs under the bar so you can recharge while you relax."}
{"text":"Baring in mind this is a bar in the airport I was INCREDIBLY impressed! I asked for a sandwich and off handedly mentioned we were sharing it. It was brought out on two separate plates already cut... most restaurants won't do that!!! I watched a waitress chase down a customer to make sure he didn't forget the full water bottle he left on the table. Plus the selection of local beers is awesome!! Sooooo impressed"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner before our flight. The food was decent for airport food. It was overpriced because of location. It reminded me of TGI Friday/ Ruby Tuesday. I expected better from one of my favorite Iron Chef!"}
{"text":"A little $$ but love the option to get hot breakfast for takeaway. Love the egg white sandwich."}
{"text":"I love stopping here and always arrive at the airport early to make sure I can! The chocolate milkshake with a shot of Kaluha...OMG. The smallest salad on the menu is the small simply dressed salad...it is perfectly dressed and always fresh. And the pierogi appetizer is my go to order! The mustard-sour cream compliments then perfectly!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised when I tried this bar to eat lunch at Bar Symon at the Cleveland Airport while waiting for my connecting flight.  I found the staff outstandingly friendly and helpful and they made my long wait more pleasant. Nice selection of craft beers and the food was very good. I wasn't going to eat at first as I sipped on my delicious Michael Manhattan, but the food was calling my name. I had the parmesan and rosemary fries, and the BBQ sandwich with the coffee BBQ sauce! If you need lucnh or a quick bite definitely give them a try...you'll be pleased!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on Sept. 14, 2014 late morning to catch an outbound flight.  If you have the time the Arugala salad is the healthiest option on the menu.  It's a good size, so it takes a lot of chewing.  The Mac & Cheese was much better this time from previous visits.  The remainder of the menu is just so-so for me.  Beers are expensive. I think $11.00 a draft. The one star is for the waitress who could not decide who she wanted to flirt with.  Me or my husband.  First she would call me \"dear\" then call him \"dear\"  then me \"dear\" then him again.  You get the picture.  She wasn't calling anyone else \"dear\". So what I always say is, call everyone \"dear\", or no one \"dear.  It just sounds stupid."}
{"text":"I travel alot and was happy to finally try out Bar Symon! Best airport food I've had! There is also a good local beer selection  here. The staff seemed to all be in good spirits and having a good time. My server Billy was attentive and made me laugh while waiting to catch my flight. I'll definitely be back next time when I'm waiting for a flight."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Good customer service. My server had good vibes and i enjoyed his company. I ordered the poutine dish and was disappointed. The meat in the gravy ruined the taste. It would have tasted much better if it was just normal gravy. I have yet to find a restaurant in America that makes a quality poutine. I had hope for this restaurant, but was disappointed in the end. The overall taste wasn't bad. But the gravy made it hard to finish the dish."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this restaurant is great and clean, but the food was anticlimactic.  I ordered a simple salad with chicken and fries.  My wife ordered a plain cheese burger with nothing else.  My salad was simple to be expected but my fries were cold and overcooked, plus my wife got her cheese burger with tomatoes, onions and lettuce all over it. They took her burger back and slapped a new piece on over all the tomato remnants still on the burger.  Friday's is near by and I've eating there on other trips into Pittsburgh, I recommend the food there because it's always hot and what I've ordered."}
{"text":"I never would have thought that my first Yelp review would be of an airport restaurant, but Bar Symon left me with such a delicious taste in my mouth I felt compelled to spread the news.   I had the pulled pork sandwich and a side salad. The vinaigrette in the salad was the tastiest salad dressing that I've ever had outside if my own kitchen. The pulled pork was messy and by the time I was halfway through I needed a knife and fork but it was very tasty, as well.   The service was charming, knowledgeable and prompt and they had a nice selection of beers on tap.  There were so many other great sounding dishes on the menu I was hoping I could find a location near me. On that score I'm out of luck, so now I need an excuse to come back through the Pittsburgh airport!"}
{"text":"If you follow any of my posts, my gluten free diet because of allergies is obvious.   I decided to come to Bar Symon for breakfast. Joel seated us and discussed my allergy with the chef. The manager David came and discussed possibilities of cross contamination. He listened to easy advise to keep me from getting contaminated: he relayed the information to the chef and they all truly cared.   My breakfast sandwich with the gluten free bun was delicious. My son ordered pancakes but couldn't finish them. If you have multiple kids, I'd recommend splitting pancakes. Enough for one each. I give them a 10 if I could for customer service, cleanliness and quality of food.   Thank you so much for not getting me sick."}
{"text":"Stopped in Bar Symon during a delay for a flight to PHX. Sat at the bar and was promptly helped by the bartender. She got me a menu to look over while she got me a glass of wine.  I ordered the bacon cheese burger with blue cheese on a gluten free bun! It was perfectly filling for me. The menu items don't come with any sides which is kind of nice so you don't get too full before your flight. It's definitely a bit more expensive than other spots in the airport.   I'd recommend a burger here, and will certainly be back again on another trip!"}
{"text":"I'm never a sucker for advertisements, but my flight was delayed, and I saw an ad saying that this place had \"the best burger\" so we stopped by.  I got an order of their macaroni with tomatoes and beef. It was a large portion and comforting and filling, with melted cheese on top. Nothing particularly great about the dish but it's what I was craving at the time!  My husband got their burger with cheese and bacon. It was too big and overwhelming and I didn't think it was that great. The burgers don't come with fries so that was annoying, you had to order them separately if you wanted them.  This place is a typical casual airport eatery, don't be fooled there's an Iron Chef promoting it!"}
{"text":"So much average. Average food average service... Average. Not bad, not good. I had turkey burger, wife had cheese burger."}
{"text":"We came in, were seated, then we sat there....And sat there. This is an airport restaurant, people, not a Parisian sidewalk cafe. Time is of the essence.   We sat there for 5 minutes with no wait staff coming to greet us or deliver water. What's worse, is that 2 staff members walked past us without saying a thing while making an effort to not make eye contact. Another staff member was in the corner eating, whilst the hostess was sitting down folding napkins and ignoring us. The least any of them could have done was to explain that our server, whomever they were, was indisposed at the moment, for whatever reason, and that they would be there as soon as possible to take care of us.  This lack of curtesy reflects very poorly on my favorite Iron Chef, Michael Symon and his brand.   We left, deciding that a McDonalds breakfast (and staff) would be more accommodating to our needs in that situation.   I have had their food before and it's mighty tasty. Just don't go there in the morning.   Bad Form, Bar Symon Pittsburgh Airport. Train your waitstaff on basic courtesy and get it together."}
{"text":"For the price this place is great.  I had a whole lobster and their yummy brussel sprouts for 20 bucks once.  The lobster was roasted and served with a yummy tangy cream sauce.  However, I ended up just dipping it in the brussel sprouts because they taste good with anything.  The chicken wings are farily good but are a little oily.   The pastrami was fork tender and full of flavor.  The Guinness ice cream tastes like a sweet glass of beer. Again, for the price the place is great.  My boyfriend and I had drinks, appetizers, entrees and a shared dessert for under 50 bucks."}
{"text":"A quick review: I've never been to Michael Symon's other restaurants, but knowing the reputation I was expecting something pretty darn good. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't had such high expectations.   We went in on a Thursday night at about 6:30. There wasn't as wait and service was good. The beer list is massive. Many are outrageously overpriced but the selection is so large you can find something to suit your taste and budget.  Started off with the Pork Crackling which is a fancy serving of pork rinds. I suppose I should have known better as the thought of pork rinds disgusts me, but I hoped Symon would prove me wrong. They were pretty bad. Not much flavor after the initial spices. And they had these hard chunks in them that were absolutely impossible to bite through. I had to spit the pieces out onto my plate. No one at the table had more than a few bites. Not sure if this is normal, but the ones we had were worthless.  The soup of the day was fantastic [Seafood Chowder] and I had Thursday's special [Pork Roast] which was also quite good but a bit fatty.   Overall, I liked the place but wouldn't go back in a hurry. It's really those pork rinds that knock a whole star off the rating."}
{"text":"I always wonder to myself how much food experience people in Cleveland have outside of the city to make some of the comments they do.  I grew up in Cleveland, and lived there for 31 of my 39 years on this planet.  The rest were spent mostly in NYC eating in the food capital of the world, so I have a pretty solid basis of comparison - trust me when I say the place is fantastic.  I'd actually give it 4.5 for the food, the other half star comes from the beer selection, which just about edges out Tremont Tap House and Melt for best in NE Ohio.  I've only been here twice, but the amount of food tried during those two visits, and the consistency from the first to the next qualify for a valid critique, I think.  First time was with a huge group of people for a holidays gathering 2 days after Christmas '09.  I was able to try about 4 different kinds of sausage, all of which were *perfectly* cooked, some pickled bean and onions, fries, the trout, pork shank (amazing), and various desserts, including the bacon & apple bread pudding.  Contrary to another reviewer's opinion that misses drastically, this dessert hit a home run.  I was skeptical about bacon's place in a dessert, but this is just really, really good...apple and pork go hand in hand, and so the flavors here meshed very well, and the bread pudding was moist and of nice consistency.  The second was for the monthly beer-pairing dinner in May of this year.  The theme was pork, and this was just insane...from concept to presentation, to the actual food:  Popcorn cooked in pork fat Pork Pate Cuban pork sliders Crispy Pig's Ears Crackling A nice salad of tomato, olives, peppers and cucumbers topped with a massive pork belly crouton Pork neck tacos w/ whipped avocado and tomatillo salsa Pork loin w/ peaches, arugula & almonds and a fantastic dessert that featured bacon...again.  Every single dish hit.  The servers and extra hands they had for that night did an absolutely amazing job in bringing out the dishes on time.  Our server on the first visit knew his job well, too.  The actual space is very well designed and extremely comfortable.  If you love beer and Symon's approach to food, I highly recommend you get in on one of these dinners.  Love this place, and can't wait to get back to Cleveland so I roll through here again.  Cheers to Michael in general, and to Matt Harlan for orchestrating and pulling this restaurant off in such a casual fashion."}
{"text":"Business traveler heading through Pittsburgh - I got the \"Pittsburgher\" - a sandwich that captures some of the regional food.   The place was packed with tables close together ; very typical airport arrangement.  Service was quick , food was good and server came back multiple times to check.  There was 3 of us -- all had different things and a good experience.   This rates up as one of the best airport restaurant experiences I have had ;  to calibrate - I travel an average of 130 days a year with hitting at least 6 airports per month."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad! Bar seating has ample power outlets, and the restaurant has free wifi.  I loved the Rosemary Fries that everyone raved about, and I just got a plain Cheeseburger. The bun was a little stale, but they buttered it up and grilled it, so it was fine. For the burger, you get two choices: \"pink\" or \"no pink.\" I ordered \"pink,\" and it was cooked OK- the burger had good flavor.   The reason I can't give it 4 stars is that if I have to eat at the airport, I wouldn't make a sure beeline to Symon, with TGIs next to it. The burger was good, but not sure the price was justified with all items a la carte. TGIs also has more options."}
{"text":"I've gotta update my previous review. I have since been contacted by the management here. They apologized for my experience. A few words go a long way and customer service is important.... kudos."}
{"text":"Last time I was flying out of here I wanted to try it.   It's got to be awesome if Chef Symon has his name on it.    Ordered the biscuits and gravy     The plating was decent, a little skimpy on the gravy and the eggs and bacon were both overlooked.  But good flavor and compared to most airport food priced right and overall good but not great. I just had a little higher expectation , I'll give it another try next month when I am back.    The menu looks good and was given the opportunity to have either breakfast or lunch.   The staff were helpful although when I arrived I was expecting to be greeted by a hostess but wound up showing myself to a seat and they caught up with me.       I would say to give them a shot and I will try it again next time but was hoping for that perfect first impression."}
{"text":"Had a martini and sandwich here before my flight.  Everything was really good, I even tried their coffee barbecue sauce and must say im kinda a fan :)  I would venture to say this is the best option at the Pittsburgh Airport.   Have fun!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and my waitress Nikki was awesome. I will make sure to stop by again when in Pittsburgh Airport."}
{"text":"Decent airport food.  I had the burger with egg and it tasted great.  The fries were a la carte which was disappointing.  Some different microbrews to help cool things down were also on the menu.  I felt like they were trying to move us out, but with a flight delay, I wasn't going anywhere.  The major area for improvement would be the beer selection."}
{"text":"I am a really big fan of Michael Symon so I was excited to try his restaurant.  I opted for the grilled cheese and fries.  I wasn't in the mood for a burger and I didn't see anything else on the menu that I wanted at the time.  The grilled cheese was fancy it had a good bread selection it had red peppers and arugula on it.  I am not a big beer fan so I opted for an Anger Orchard.  The service was good but I wasn't really impressed with the food selection.  I heard the breakfast is amazing so the next time I am in Pittsburgh I will try that instead."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but no. Just normal fare, nothing special. Being Gluten Free,  I appreciated the \"GF\" markings on the menu. But when basically the only things you have that ARE actually GF are some rather bland choices for salads, that's not good."}
{"text":"I went to Bar Symon on the basis of previous Yelp reviewers and was not disappointed. Many tables will filled around 5:30 pm and there was a short wait for a table. It was loud and gradually quieted down as people went off to catch their flights.  My server was very personable. I was able to order a drink and meal in short order. The \"Gobbler\" is a turkey burger and tasted like it was char-broiled. It was very tasty and I had a side order of onion rings as well. My drink and food were made with quality ingredients. Bar Symon is a great place to get a bite."}
{"text":"Eh, had an early arrival at the airport and a few hours to spare. We were planning on grabbing some breakfast food, and we came across Bar Symon. For anyone that knows me, I'm a huge Food Network fan and Mike Symon is by far one of my favorite chefs on there. So I wanted to give this restaurant a try.   The menu was interesting and small for breakfast so the choices weren't hard to make at all. Our waitress asked me what type of egg I wanted since it was \"any style\" so I asked for poached. She immediately said \" we don't do poached.\" So maybe that should be specified a little better. The service was terrible, after our waitress first rushed us through our order - never once asked us how our meal was - not once asked us if we wanted a refill for our $3 a piece free refill drinks and just threw the bill on our table never asking us if our order was complete. One of the most horrible servers I can ever remember having.   The food was good though, aside from my spoonful amount of home fries and lack of enough butter and jam to get even on half one side of my English muffin. Extremely pricey breakfast for the amount. My fiancé got eggs with biscuits and gravy - you'd think there'd be sausage like normal biscuits and gravy - not here.   I liked the ambience of the restaurant - the decor was unusual and modern and interesting - but the chairs weren't comfortable - hard wood.   I would eat here again to give it another try because it wasn't the food that was bad- but make sure I get a different waitress because I didn't see any other server that day be as rude as ours was. So maybe it would've made my experience a little better had that been the case."}
{"text":"Was thrilled to see a Michael Symon restaurant in the Pittsburgh airport. Had the bacon cheeseburger, rosemary fries and bells oberon. Great lunch meal before flight."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food. In fact, it seemed like one of the fresher options. Wanting something on the healthier side, got the grilled chicken sandwich. There wasn't much avocado but it helped the sandwich not be dry, as did the melted cheese. The cilantro added some nice flavor. The sourdough bread was buttered and toasted. Everything is a la cart, so don't expect any fries. I'd definitely order it again if I was in a pinch and needed something before my flight! Rating a 4 for airport food...if this was outside the airport I'd probably give it a 3 :)"}
{"text":"The roasted chicken and goat cheese Mac N Cheese is delicious! There's other mac n cheeses and different types of sandwiches, not a huge, which is fine. A little on the pricey side, but you do get a lot of food. I couldn't even finish my meal because there was so much of it.   Bar Symon is a great addition to the Pittsburgh Airport and if you have time before, after of in between flights go try it out."}
{"text":"Best airport retaurant I've been too. Food vs value is great and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I know it's just an airport restaurant, but Symon has a reputation and I've had good food here. Not today. Simple omelet. Unseasoned. Overwhelmed with clear vegetable oil of some sort. Not very tasty... even for an airport.  Great service, otherwise 2 stars"}
{"text":"A solid meal here.  The burger was tasty as was the mac and cheese.  I found the prices to be a little on the high side but then again it is an airport.  When in PIA I would definitely consider eating there again. They also have take-out if needed."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today for dinner while waiting for a delayed flight in the airport.  Whenever I got up to the host station I was asked if I needed to charge any devices which I found to be thoughtful.  Unfortunately I did not and so I am not sure if they would have put me at a different seat if I had needed to or if they would have done something else.  After that I was quickly taken to a two top where I was greeted shortly afterwards by my waitress.  Seeing how this restaurant is at an airport, I don't think there is too much decor around.  There were some string lights in one area and then a number of TV's with random sporting events all around the rest of the restaurant.  After talking with the waitress for a minute and then perusing the menu for a bit, I tried to order a drink.   The waitress informed me that they sold out of it earlier in the day.  I eventually chose a second drink (made about 2 hours away) and when asked about the size decided on a small.  It would come out as a large and cost a ridiculous $10.99.  Besides the drink I also ended up ordering the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and since their sandwiches are a la carte, some parmesan rosemary fries.  Everything came out to my table within 5 minutes of ordering which I guess can be a good thing if you are in a hurry to catch a flight.  I was not and so I was pretty surprised whenever I had just texted my wife to tell her I was eating at the airport when my food started arriving at the table.  I started off by eating the pulled pork sandwich and to be honest, it didn't have much flavor.  The main reason that I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich was that it was supposed to be made with their coffee BBQ sauce.  Sadly that seemed to be missing from my sandwich (or there was just a very small amount of it) and the only type of condiment  that I could notice on my sandwich ended up being the cole slaw.  Other than the lack of flavor I also had an issue with the bun for this sandwich as it was not toasted.  Half of my sandwich fell out of the bun because of the dual issues of it being stacked high and the fact that there was no barrier to the moisture of the cole slaw.  After I had finished half of my sandwich, I reached for my fork to to eat the rest off of my plate.  It was then that  I noticed that there was actually extra coffee BBQ sauce at my table in the condiment caddie.  I took advantage of that and it really helped out the sandwich.  The BBQ sauce was easily the best part of it as it had a nice twang to it and then a slowly creeping heat that I loved.  Whenever I had finally finished the sandwich, I moved onto the fries and thought that they were pretty good.  They  were of the shoestring variety and cooked to a nice crispy exterior.  The toppings of rosemary and parmesan were delicious as well and I really ended up enjoying the fries.  The bottom line for me is that I would not head back here again in the future.  I feel like my entree was a major let down and that the total price was quite ridiculous for what I received.  At least the BBQ sauce (once I found it) and the fries were pretty good."}
{"text":"I've stopped by here on a few different occasions.  I have yet to find something I really enjoy here, so I keep going back to their macaroon and cheese dishes with whatever topping.  Those aren't really that great as the portion sizes are on the small side with very little of the meat topping.  I typically douse the dish in bbq sauce, eat the part that has meat on it, and save some calories!  Nothing here appears healthy either.  If anything, this might be an OK place to come get a drink, but if you're looking for food I'd recommend trying something else in the airport.  Service here has been hit or miss.  I've had one very excellent time here with the staff and a few mediocre/poor experiences.  If you come here you're taking a chance."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here before a flight at PIT.  The service is good and the lunch/dinner menu has a great selection of burgers.  On the table they have some tasty BBQ sauces.  When I had breakfast on this recent trip I ordered the pulled pork egg burrito. Someone from the kitchen delivered it to me and suggested I try it with the coffee BBQ sauce.  Good call.   They also have their own free wifi for you to use while dining here."}
{"text":"Meh.  Am I the only one who thinks maybe Michael Symon needs to slow down a little bit?  I've been really unimpressed with Lolita the last few times I went there and Bar Symon was only average.    The decor is interesting but reminded me a little bit of The Publican in Chicago.  The concept does, too, now that I think about it...just less refined.  The pork rinds were perfect.  Sausage sampler was okay, the sausages were a bit dry and the brine on the pickles vegetables was so salty that they were amost inedible. The chicken wings were very good.  They had sold out of the pork roast, so we got the pork chop.  It was dry and underseasoned, and the accompanying peaches were tart, not sweet.  The fried chicken with truffle honey was delicous, and that's what I'd order if I were to ever return.  We ordered side dishes of creamed corn with bacon (my favorite part of the meal!) and fried brussels sprouts (needed salt).  As you can tell, this is not diet food.  Everything is reasonably priced though, and our service was good (lose the aprons, guys, they just look sloppy because they're saggy and misshapen)."}
{"text":"Caveat: 4 stars based on any other option in the Pittsburgh airport. This is a 3 star in ATL, DTW, HOU or LAX. That said, we are tiny compared to any of those so I'll take what I can get for upscale dining ...   Fun, bright decor. Giant picture of Symon in the bar area is a little creepy but whatever, he's a decent looking dude. A few tv's big enough to catch a game. Free wi-fi (just like the rest of the airport) but wi-fi server is IN the restaurant so the connection is strong; way better than what you get sitting back in a corner of any of the terminals.   I sat at the bar for a couple beers and a quick bite. Everything is reasonably priced ($8-$12 for salads/sammies/burgers). They also have a few varieties of mac'n cheese and fries topped with goodies for those of you looking for something a little more indulgent. I went with the grilled cheese, which was good but nothing to write home about. Was topped with roasted red peppers that had almost a chemical taste to them; and it was a little underseasoned.   For yinz airport boozehounds out there the draft list is decent although not local by any means. And the bartenders don't know a thing about the beer they are serving (I found myself often trying to educate other patrons politely because the bartender completely misquoted the style or region where the brewer was located). That's my main cause for at least 1/2 star docking. BUT ... drum roll please ... PBR cans for $3. You won't find a better deal unless you are out on the mean streets of PGH for a PBR can. Sweet."}
{"text":"Here we go 5 stars here we go. 5 stars because the service was top notch (thanks Jessica)  food was really good because eating at an airport wouldn't be your first choice for dining but the food here was awesome. Best chicken sandwich I have had in a long time..      Try the onion rings you won't be disappointed. Blue cheese dressing was suggested by our waitress and I am so glad I got to try the house made blue cheese. Delicious. I would definitely dine here again when traveling.       Btw bud light on the menu so that was a plus."}
{"text":"So, this is an airport restaurant, so their main goal really should be to get you in and out in a reasonable amount of time. In this, they 100% fail. 40 minutes is too long to make a salad.  No matter where you are.  Also, as an airport restaurant, maybe don't wait until your customer is foaming at the mouth before saying that there's a delay. That said, the food at last was not good. Warm chicken, too much feta and soggy greens do not a delectable salad make. Oh, and all the chickpeas you could ever want.  And then some. Combined with really bad service, not a great experience. Maybe they were having an off day? They comped the salad without me asking for it, but at 45 minutes after ordering with no notice that the meal would be late, it felt like too little too late, though the gesture was appreciated.    The drinks were okay.  Like the fresh lemonade, which tasted kind of fresh? And there was an outlet, so that was a real highlight. If you're in a hurry, go elsewhere.  And don't eat the chickpea salad, which... now that I see that typed out, that was a given."}
{"text":"Beer selection: 4 Food: 2.5 Service / Atmosphere: 2  ...I am here almost weekly...   BEER: Better beer selection than you can typically find at an airport. I wish they would switch out the drafts on a monthly basis. The same ones have gotten boring. (and can we please not waste a draft space on Miller Lite... who ever drinks that stuff doesn't care about flavor anyway... give it to 'em in a can or a bottle).  FOOD: Good, but compared to what competition (Chili's, Friday's, Chipotle,..). The bar isn't set very high. Compared to the airport peers, Symon's is better.  SERVICE / ATMOSPHERE: All the complaints about slow / lackadaisical service are true. Noise is also really bad. Very crowded (people will be bumping into you and you won't really have anywhere to put your luggage)."}
{"text":"Really delightful treat before a flight. I'm glad I was early to the airport. Scrambled eggs, crispy rosemary potatoes with Lola ketchup or Coffee BBQ sauce - a lovely treat.   Not the cheapest food in the airport by any means, but I had 3 hours (yes I'm crazy and arrived a tad early for my flight) to kill so why not splurge on a good meal."}
{"text":"This Bar Symon is located on Concourse C in Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.  I stopped in to Bar Symon for breakfast one morning for a late breakfast - before boarding the flight back to IAD. I opted to try the biscuits and gravy with eggs over easy. The biscuits are topped with a sausage gravy, then sprinkled with some cheddar melted on top, then finished with some chopped scallions. Served with a side of crispy bacon.  Very tasty! The one thing I will ding them on - is I wish the dish had MORE of the gravy on the biscuits. It was a very thin layer of gravy - and did not allow all of the biscuit to soak up that gravy yumminess. The bacon was delicious!  Service was good! As often as I fly to Cleveland - I am sure I will be back here to try other things!  #BarSymon"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try Michael Symon!  And it was worth it.  The trip to Belgium was filled with burgers...not exactly what my health needs...but...sometimes you go with the flow.  And that flow led me here...for my last road meal...  I had the Bacon Cheeseburger, but please add pickles.  This came with basic burger, I got Pepper Jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion...all on Challah bread.  YUMMY!  The burger was cooked well (particularly given this was in an airport!) and everything balanced.  It did emit a good bit of \"juice\"...so be careful of that as the Challah soaks it up and becomes a bit soft.  Also got the Rosemary Parmesan fries...another good choice.  A bit too much Parmesan at times, but it shakes off.  A good side for the burger...  All in all...exactly what I expected from a Symon joint...very good basic food!"}
{"text":"They make an incredible Moscow Mule and they gave to-go cups. I was mad my flight was delayed, canceled and rescheduled. I found myself enjoying my wait time at Bar Symon. There were outlets everywhere so I could stay connected to my world. I ordered the cheddar mac n cheese. It was amazing!! Shawn was my server he offered exceptional and attentive service. Don't go to Fridays go to Bar Symon they don't compare!!! Before I knew it I was well nourished, phone fully charged and buzzed with my to-go cup. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Ordered fish platter. The worst. It was mushy, soggy, fried fish. Manager couldn't have cared any less. Not any attempt to offer another meal to try. The only pleasant part was the waitress, Sarah. Bad food, bad experience."}
{"text":"ate here a couple of weeks ago... i am a fan of all of mike symons places and his newest is also very good.  When going to any of symon places you must eat pork it is the law and bar symon holds true to form,  we started with a bar snack of flavored popcorn i wanted the pork rinds but got out voted by my girlfriend. it was good but not great.  we then moved on to the pork crouton salad and it was amazing.  wonderful roasted pork belly a perfectly poached egg served on top of very nice salad it was heaven on a plate.  for dinner i had the skirt steak it was very good and my girlfriend had the fried chicken which was also very good.  worth the stop.. the two down falls are the location in a strip mall and it is not nearly as cute loltias or as fancy as lolas"}
{"text":"Best airport food ever.  I try to not have an overly heavy meal getting on a plane, so I've stuck with the salads. Chickpea and Arugula were awesome, even had a burger on top which was delicious.  Had the simple salad with chicken today. A nice light, healthy meal, but still delicious. I can't tell you how much better that chicken is than the standard airport quick fridge.  Every time I'm in PIT, I stop by."}
{"text":"I had the blue salad with a burger. It was good but I wish there was more flavors for a $18 salad. The burger on top was cooked perfectly. I'd eat here again only if I am not paying for it."}
{"text":"Pretty good food in the Pittsburgh Airport . . .. Bar Symon is located INSIDE the Pittsburgh Airport. I had lunch there twice. The first time I had the Baked Mac & Cheese, and I thought it was pretty good and very creamy on the inside and crispy on the top where it was baked. The second time I had the Fish & Chips for lunch, and I thought the fish was decent, I really liked the fries and cole slaw (although I thought the portion size on the slaw was a little skimpy). Service was good both times and the food arrived pretty fast, so I would recommend eating there next time you are passing through the airport.  P.S.  You never know who you may see there, as actress Olivia Wilde was eating lunch at the table right next to me!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice for an airport bar/restaurant.  I had a Rogue Dead Guy Ale (impressive they had it on tap) and a beef and provolone mac-n-cheese.  An entire section on my menu is dedicated to mac-n-cheese which I thought was pretty awesome.  Thought I found it to be slightly bland and could have used some more flavor, but that's how most Pittsburgh places tend to be for me coming from New Orleans.  Initially the servers didn't notice when I sat down so it took some time to get a server but once I did she was attentive.  I sat at the bar overlooking the center of the terminal which was perfect for people watching, but this creepy guy who apparently didn't want to be a paying customer kept pacing back and forth and poking his head in over my table to see the Steelers game on the TV which was on the screen next to me.  After he actually leaned over my table several times and had his radio on loud up in my face (playing the narrative of the game) I finally suggested to him to go sit at the bar and stop hanging over my table and he finally went away but was pretty pissy about it.  It would have been nice if the restaurant staff had said something to him.  The bar and restaurant area were only half full so there was no excuse not to come inside and buy a drink at least."}
{"text":"Very very good hamburger. Nice soft bun which makes all the difference to me.  The pierogis and kielbasa was very good too. I'm not much of a Mac and cheese fan, but theirs was good!"}
{"text":"I ordered the three egg plate with scrambled eggs, but the eggs came out as thin sheets of over-cooked dry eggs. Worst scrambled eggs I've ever had. The sausage gravy was luke-warm and over powered by wine, which seemed to have not evaporated enough. For twenty dollars total for breakfast, what they serve is way over priced. Waitress service was good though."}
{"text":"Quite honestly Pittsburgh is one of my least favorite destinations. However, Bar Symon always makes it a little better. The burgers, sandwiches and Fries are all above average for regular fare let alone airport fare. Always local craft beer on tap. Try the coffee BBQ sauce at the table. I only wish they would offer it for sale to take home!"}
{"text":"I would be in serious financial trouble (and wearing bigger pants) if I lived any closer to Bar Symon. The food is consistently excellent, and service has gone from very inconsistent when they opened to much more professional. Our visit this week was a typical representation of the things that they do so well. I usually make a meal out of two starters, and this time was no exception. I started with the polenta with mushrooms and parmesan, and would have been perfectly happy with just that. It was creamy perfection, and I made the mistake of passing it around the table and having it almost not come back. I followed that with the cilantro-lime wings (tender, and even tastier the next day as leftovers). Two of our party had the bone marrow, after which they have difficulty not licking the plate, and the pork burgers, which were piggy perfection. Dessert was the caramel cake. Split four ways, it was a perfect end to the meal. Beer, wine, and liquor selection is extensive and well-chosen."}
{"text":"Good burger joint in the Pittsburgh Int. Airport. Owned by Michael Symon of the Food Network. I had the Lola Burger, which consisted of a delicious Challah bun, really fresh, on the burger was cheddar, pickled Red onions, bacon, and a fried egg. Great burger, cooked to order. I'm a burger lover, so two thumbs up for this one."}
{"text":"So being efficient and getting to airport early didn't really work out for me except to find out that this place exisits.  When my flight was cancelled and I had six plus hours at the airport, I thought I'd end of eating at the same old places.  I had no idea about Bar Symon and boy was I happy.  I ordered a pastrami sandwich but skipped the fries.  The sandwich was really excellent and I'd definitely go back.  The prices were a little high as other views stated but this is the airport after all.   Was satified with my overall experience."}
{"text":"People should remember that this is about as pricey as going to Applebees... And is FAR better.  Been here probably 4 or 5 times.  Dinner is pretty solid (again keep in mind that this is in the TGI Fridays price range), really enjoy the Guiness Ice Cream.  Brunch has been fantastic both times we've gone for it."}
{"text":"I'm particular when I order something it should be made to order. I ordered a bagel toasted with butter for breakfast to go. I get to the gate about to eat the bagel they toasted it but did not put the butter on the bagel. I had to put the butter on the now cold dry bagel. Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick lunch on Friday and was fairly impressed.  I would say that Bar Symon is designed as an airport restaurant, not a restaurant that happens to be in an airport--lots of outlets, generous amount of space at all of the counters (probably 3 feet per person--enough for a computer and food), free wireless, and fairly quick service.  That said, if Bar Symon wants to be called a \"Taphouse\" they need to expand the beer list--native Pittsburghers won't be too impressed.  I had the pulled pork fries, which was quite tasty although the distribution of the toppings left me with a pile of plain fries at the bottom.  No matter, I tried the coffee BBQ sauce (delicious!) and the Lola ketchup (weirdly sweet and not what I would call a ketchup).  One quibble with service--the gentleman next to me ordered a burger, and was asked \"pink or no pink?\"  He (quite understandably) said, \"come again?\" and the waitress explained that he could have it medium or well--pink or no pink. I thought this might be a one-off occurrence but heard that phrase being echoed throughout the restaurant at various points.  Service was prompt, very friendly (including the host), and servers seemed pretty knowledgeable about the menu despite it being the restaurant's first week.  Happy to be free of Micky D's for a pre-departure meal!"}
{"text":"So glad they added this place to the airport.  Food is great and excellent for airport food.  Pretty reasonably priced for an airport as well."}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp. Hoped it would be a good one, but alas, not so lucky. Happen to have some time on my return to Atlanta from Pittsburgh and was pleasantly surprised to see Bar Symon there. I have a pretty hefty tomato harvest every year and use his recipe to make the blue cheese tomato soup and I absolutely love it. So naturally I figured the same soup at HIS restaurant would be a heck of a lot better! Sorry, but it's wasn't even close. No blue cheese flavor at all. I hate to say it, but I only ate 3 spoon fulls. The macaroni and cheese with chicken was palatable, but nothing worth writing home about. Hardly any chicken. The only saving grace was the BBQ sauce and Lola Sauce. Both were very tasty. The waitress didn't charge me for the soup, so that was good customer service. Otherwise I would have given 1 star. Sorry, but as my parents used to say, this (review) hurts me more than it hurts you."}
{"text":"You'd be hard pressed to find a better airport restaurant.  Many great choices.  The Parmesan Rosemary fries are a must.  There are also many outlets for charging, which is another plus."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER EVER (I had the \"Fun Guy\"), and great local craft beer to wash it down.  Fries and special ketchup/sauce very good as well.  Finally, a valid reason to show up at the airport two hours before my flight!"}
{"text":"Convenient restaurant/bar in the Cleveland Airport.   If you have a Priority Pass care as I do, you $28 credit here.   I had the beer-battered fish when I went last today I ordered the turkey sandwich. Both are great choices and are filling."}
{"text":"This place was great! I highly recommend it! The sauces for fries were fantastic; super yummy! Great selection of beers; seriously you can't go wrong eating here. Chef Symon has done himself proud. The kitchen staff prepared the food perfectly and the wait staff was very accommodating and friendly. I would go here repeatedly if it was closer to where I live. One comment of advice: eat here!"}
{"text":"If this was outside and airport I would give it 3 stars, but since it is inside and airport restaurants are always lacking this one the food tasted good.   I swung by for breakfast and had the pulled pork breakfast burrito. The waitress recommended I eat it with the coffee bbq sauce and I am glad I listened, it was delish. The burrito had good flavor, but was a little underwhelming in portion size and appearance. Why on earth would they put hot sauce on the outside of the burrito when you are supposed to use your hands to eat it...thus it gets all over your hands or you eat it like I did with a fork and knife."}
{"text":"Flew into Pittsburgh for an AM meeting, was all wrapped up by lunchtime so headed to the airport to catch the flight - delayed eight hours, of course. With time to kill our party hit Bar Symon, a really good call.  Our table ordered two plates of Lola fries as appetizers: the porky fries and the Rosemary Parm fries. The Rosemary fries get top marks - everyone thought they were delicious. The Porky fries not so much - the majority of our party was turned off by the pool of grease underneath the fries, which was really more pork drippings than actual grease.  Everyone loved their burgers - hands down. Even those that had the Globbler turkey burger. One diner regretted asking for a bun-less burger after seeing how delicious the buns were. Gluten allergies are tough!  I expected the food to be decent. What I didn't expect was the free WIFI and TONS of power plugs. Seriously, if you need to power up your device, go HERE. Plugs for miles, unlike the rest of the airport.  Oh, and the bar was great too. Since we had eight hours to kill, we killed quite a few in the bar. Very friendly bartender, she called me \"honey.\" Works every time!"}
{"text":"I should have gone with my standard TGIF.  The tomato soup tasted more like a tomato sauce.  It took me a little bit to figure out what the ground pork Mac n cheese tasted like.  Then it hit me...a can of Chef Boyardee Macaroni and Meat Sauce.  Tomato sauce was so greasy. The ground pork taste like ground beef.  I was extremely disappointed.  I normally give a place a second chance but I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"This was a quick stop before boarding the plane and only because this place has just been added to the list of Priority Pass restaurants where one can eat for free (if you have the credit card that allows you to belong this exclusive club for $450 a year)  The Chickpeas Salad was really good, the vegetables were fresh, crunchy and the combination with chickpeas made it a great choice. Although I felt that the salad wouldn't be filling enough and went and ordered a side order of poutine, I must admit that the salad is more than enough for a person of my size (And I can eat a double quarter pounder with fries and dessert!)  The poutine is a Midwest version, not the Canadian version. The nice thing about this dish is the addition of gravy on top of the cheese curds. Really really good, like anything that you add gravy to.  The waitress suggested a local beer, I don't remember the name but it was very hoppy and wheaty and very delicious.  Service was EXCELLENT, with a huge smile, great recommendations and very quickly, so definitely will visit again next time we're in the airport."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the menu, so I decided to dine here for a pre-flight lunch. The focus of the menu seems to be on their fries, burgers, sandwiches, and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. They also had a nice selection of craft beers including Fat Head's Head Hunter, Great Lakes' Dortmunder Gold, and Bell's (I believe it was the Two Hearted); definitely, an impressive selection, especially for an airport restaurant.  I opted for the Ground Lamb baked macaroni and cheese. I expected a creamy dish (given, it's Mac'N'Cheese). What I received was a half-overcooked pasta dish with meat sauce topped with cold chunks of feta cheese. I'm no cooking expert, but I think the dish was baked in a pan with too big of a diameter leading the macaroni to be overcooked rather than receiving a crispy top-layer finish when baked in a bowl with a smaller radius. Also, the feta didn't sit well with the meat sauce for me, so I just pushed it to the side.  Lastly, the waitresses were nice, and free WiFi was available."}
{"text":"The best place to eat out at Pittsburgh International Airport.  The salads are fresh and the grilled chicken sandwich is the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This place is good when you're waiting for a flight.  I had the Greek yogurt.  It was very good (although it was the most expensive yogurt I ever had.). It had a tasty granola, honey on the bottom, and fresh black berries, raspberries, and blue berries."}
{"text":"Great food esp for an airport.  The Fat Doug and Gobbler were great. They also had an amazing beer list.  Def worth walking to from other concourses."}
{"text":"They just know how to make their burger just right. Can't stop munching on their Rosemary fries."}
{"text":"So first of all- I didn't think to check yelp beforehand so I totally missed that there were a bunch of outlets. Oh well. So hopefully people are checking beforehand and asking to be seated at the bar or somewhere near an outlet because I got placed in the middle at a table nowhere near any outlets. (Thankfully had a powerbank with me, so I didn't end up having to ask to be reseated.)  I wasn't feeling particularly hungry so I just ended up ordering the Arugula salad and the Sausage Gravy fries. The Arugula salad was drowned in dressing and wasn't all that pleasant, so I didn't finish it. The sausage gravy fries were really good, but I'm not sure if it was worth the amount I paid for it ($5+). I guess that's to be expected from an airport restaurant?  Speaking of airport pricing, I did like the pricing for the beer ($5+) especially when I typically pay more for beer in general in the DMV area!  Overall 3/5. Would probably end up stopping by again since the alternative is a TGIF."}
{"text":"The bacon cheese burger was delicious.  I personally did not care for the taste of the Rosemary fries.  They were served hot.  Service was good."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of restaurants to choose from at the Pitt airport, and this restaurant was a pleasant surprise!   Like many other yelpers, I'm a fan of the rosemary fries and pierogis.   For an airport restaurant, 5 stars folks."}
{"text":"I was excited there was somewhere to go in the airport besides TGI Fridays.  Our salads were okay.  Our fries we're a bit lacking.  The beer was SO EXPENSIVE!  I was blown away.  We love craft beer, and wanted to start our vacation off right, so we ordered a few.  One ended up costing about $12.  Our bill was sort of outrageous for what we actually got.  It was an okay meal, but we left a little disappointed.  Sad to say, we'll probably return to good ol' TGI's."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in the Pittsburgh Airport, however I was some what disappointed this trip. The one bartender was not as experienced as the usual and was not that attentive. I had to wait for everything which is not the norm. She could have been new but could have used some help. I hope they get that one figured out quickly."}
{"text":"Bar Symon treated me to a much more excellent dining experience than I'm used to having in an airport: a nice sit-down meal complete with more food than I could finish and a decent selection of local craft brews.  The food was utterly excellent. After much deliberation, I ordered the Lola burger with a side of rosemary parmesan fries. (See the photos I've posted.) The side of fries was anything but a side... it arrived as a massive basket the size of my face, full of shoestring fries that were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, without too much greasiness. And covered in finely grated parmesan (or parmesan from a bottle... but whatever it was delicious). I tried the fries both with the coffee BBQ sauce and the Lola ketchup. I preferred the latter... it is pepper-based, and sweeter rather than spicy.  The Lola burger was equally fantastic. Beef piled with bacon, cheese, an utterly perfectly fried egg with salt & pepper, and pickled onions. Everything went well together, and the egg yolk spilled all over the dish perfectly.  Finally but most importantly, the service was excellent. I'm not sure if this was just because the waiter was flirting with me and was paying me special attention, but he brought me samples of several of the beers before making a decision about what to drink, and he answered all of my questions about the menu (including the annoying query: \"seriously what should I eat?\"). My food arrived in a timely manner, and when I was done he brought me things to pack it up with, including little sauce containers for the aforementioned Lola ketchup and coffee BBQ sauces. Oh and I got packets of mayonnaise as well... what? I like to slather my fries in creamy saucy tasty things."}
{"text":"Four stars based on the airport options only.  Very meat and fried food centric.  Loud.  Good attentive service.  Outside of an airport its a 3 at best.  Not your best representation of an Iron Chef and his cuisine."}
{"text":"Perfectly decent but unexciting spot to grab dinner at the Pittsburgh Airport. The best feature is that the bar facing outwards towards the terminal has plugs all along the underside of the bar, and you can charge your devices while you eat and drink.  I ordered the fish and chips, which was okay, but not really that great, and not quite enough food given the price. I suppose that's airport food, though.  Our server was really friendly and helpful; brought over a few different tasting cups of beer for my friend, and was very knowledgeable about the beer selection. All in all, a better option than sitting at your gate, but I'd stick to the drinks and skip the food."}
{"text":"Nothing special, but definitely beats the usual McDonalds/Subway/Quiznos nonsense and TGIF, the other main \"bar\" option at the airport.  Good beer selection for an airport bar. They had my beloved Headhunter and a handful of other decent craft beers on tap.  Had the parmesan rosemary fries which were very mediocre. The parmesan was kind of mealy and dry, not melted into the fries which I have come to expect from cheesy fries and would have been much better.  I will come back for beer the next time, but I'll probably just head to Pinkberry for sustenance."}
{"text":"As a frequent business traveler who flies out of CLE I always loved Paninis at C4. The ownership revamped the spot and WOW! Great curb appeal bundled with the menu inspired by Michael Symon and let me tell you this place is top notch. I always stop for breakfast time permitting and this morning jammed out to the Allman Brothers! Great tunes here as well. Well done!"}
{"text":"As far as draft lists go, Bar Symon has one of the best for an airport bar. If you're into craft beer and have some time to kill, this is your spot.  Most airports I frequent only have your standard domestics and a few \"crafts,\" but Bar Symon is more similar to your local favorite.  Can't say too much about the food, as I've only ordered breakfast. It was above par for airport food, was quick service, and went well with my Founder's Breakfast Stout, but I think there are faster and less expensive restaurants I'd go to."}
{"text":"Have stopped here 2 time traveling out of CLE.  First time just for some pre flight drinks and the second time for some pre flight drinks and breakfast ( don't judge). Bar service is great and the breakfast sandwich is delicious. Will make this a regular stop when I'm traveling. My flight isn't even in this concourse!!   Well worth the walk if you have time."}
{"text":"I travel trough the air port twice a week. Just found this place and it's Amazing. I'll make this a regular stop from now on. Love the French toast!"}
{"text":"While I enjoyed my meal, it probably deserves more than 3 stars, but not 4 stars, so 3 it is. Service was OK.  Staff was not friendly and on their phones way to much.  I had the Fat Doug Burger w/pastrami, swiss cheese, creamy coleslaw and some top notch stadium mustard...a good mustard that is hard to find in this area.  The burger was cooked perfectly and was very good, nice combo of flavors, good pastrami and swiss cheese.  Had a side of the Lola fries which were good but similar to many places with the rosemary seasoning.  It is a real good spot in the airport but again the competition in the airport is moot."}
{"text":"This is my first Michael Symon experience outside of Cleveland  (which was great!)  This would rate very favorably among any bar and grill.  Compared to typically mediocre airport establishments, this is in a different league.   Beer selection is very respectable.  I had a Fat Gary Nut Brown Ale.  Very nice.   I had a cup of chili, french onion burger and side of rosemary /parmesan fries.    Excellent!     Top that off with very friendly service and classic rock playing, and I'm right at home.    With the chili and the house made Lola Ketchup,  he clearly likes his cumin.  Not a complaint,  though.   I appreciate the smokiness and deeper flavors.    If you're a carnivore or a beer lover..... or both, stop here!"}
{"text":"Sat at a table for 11 minutes with no service while wait staff conversed and wrapped silver ware. Left and will never go back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  BRING BACK THE BAKED MAC'CHEESE!  Good food, friendly bartenders.  Usually a decent beer selection.  I really miss the baked mac n cheese though."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken sandwich was phenomenal for $10 and an airport meal.  Would highly recommend eating here when at Pittsburgh International Airport."}
{"text":"When macaroni and cheese is an entire category on a menu how can it possibly be bad??"}
{"text":"I had a hard time with this rating as my feelings on this place were as schizophrenic as the bar itself.   As a bar it gets 4 stars. The bartender was helpful and made some good suggestions and they have a wide variety of beers on tap.   As a bar / restaurant it gets 3 stars. The food was OK but nothing special. We had the chicken wings to start and had I only tasted BW3 wings up to this point I might have thought them well done. But I had gone to Greenhouse Tavern just the week before and their wings put these to shame. My fish was fine and fresh, but nothing outstanding. No zing. No pop. Nothing to make it stand out from the norm. I sampled around the table and felt the same way about all the food...fresh and simple. But not the good \"so well prepared and subtle that it comes off as simple but is really complex\" but instead the \"take a fresh piece of meat, put it on a wood fire grill, flip, serve\" kind of simple.   As a restaurant this gets 2 stars. The service was awful. Not taking reservations gets -1 starts right off the bat. The hostess was incompetent. We sat (and sat, and sat...for an hour) and watched tables sit empty for 10 minutes before people were seated (remember, no reservations for less than 6 people so they couldn't have been waiting for someone). Every seating was a 2-3 minute conference with other staff members. Our waiter was so overwhelmed that he kept forgetting things and told us no less than 4 times how overwhelmed and flustered he was as an apology. The place had only been open for 90 minutes...he had several more hours to go I'm guessing. I pity his customers later in the evening if he was this brain dead by 7. After we had the wings, the busboy took our bread plates that had the bones on them (oh we didn't get plates with our app --- he apologized for that as well) and pushed the bones off with his finger onto another plate and set the bread plates back on the table. Classy.   As a Michael Symon restaurant this gets 1 star. I have been waiting for him to open a west side restaurant since I moved her 5 years ago. This isn't it. Seems I will have to wait a little longer."}
{"text":"This is so weird.  The only time we get to eat here is when we are leaving town!  Why can't this bar be at a different location?  I still love Bar Symon.  It's our breakfast spot whenever we fly out of Pittsburgh.  On our most recent visit, I got my usual wheat toast and jam.  Yes, that's what I got.  And BJ got biscuits and gravy with eggs sunny side up.  The sausage in the gravy had an incredible spiciness and we both loved it!  Service is always very quick here,  I guess they don't want to be responsible for anyone missing a flight!"}
{"text":"Good place to stop before a flight but the restaurants in the airport are supposed to have street pricing. 10$ for a fathead pint is ridiculous. Stop somewhere else"}
{"text":"Sad Face.  No more Mac n cheese.  I look forward to this after 6 yearly visits.   Had pastrami on rye.   Nothing special.    2 stars for slow service.  I was not in a rush but sat over 10 before approached. Restaurant was 60% empty.  Servers hanging out gabbing in front of kitchen.    Not sure I would waste my $ for poor service and ok food.  Small salad, soda and sandwich w/fries $25!!!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a drink here before my flight took off. Bartender was fast and courteous!  They do have the flight schedule rotating on a separate TV with times and stuff on it, very helpful!  Menu looked really good, unfortunately I wasn't hungry.  Def would go back!  And def would go here over Fridays!"}
{"text":"Can't expect much from an airport but it is owned by an iron chef so what the heck, I had to try it. I wanted to go healthy so I ordered a salad with a burger on top. The vegetables did not look or taste fresh. The burger was fairly decent. I also ordered the Rosemary fries and asked for their famous ketchup. I inhaled the fries. Love the thin cut fries. Probably stick with the burger and fries next time. Going healthy is not worth it here."}
{"text":"We went here before our flight to Texas and we're pretty underwhelmed for what the namesake is known for. We didn't have a very friendly experience with staff and felt like we inconvenienced them when asking for refills. The food was okay but for a quite bite before a flight - not sure we'd go back."}
{"text":"So I can fly into Philly or Newark for work....Always has been Newark until this week.  Moving forward it is Philly...so I can eat at Bar Symon in the airport!  I am serious.  Seriously.  Great great great sandwich!  And that Lola Ketchup!??!?  Some entrepreneur is missing the boat by not bottling that...I could drink it by the gallon.  Loved this place!"}
{"text":"On par with every airport restaurant out there (I've been to JFK, EWR, LGA, ORD, CHA, PIT, etc). Overpriced, cramp seating and all the seats with outlets are taken.  This place however has poor phone service and no network connections.  Beers are overpriced, service is slow. You just want to grab and go."}
{"text":"This place has quite a way to go if it is to catch up with the Divine Chef S's other restaurants.  THE FOOD:  I understand this is a casual Michael Symon place, but even on that level, the food was just good, not great.  From Michael Symon, I have come to expect nothing but spectacular.  The pork chops were very thick and juicy and wonderful, but my side of 'shrooms was just , well, just some plain old oily sauteed 'shrooms.  The chicken wings were dry and bland.  How sad.  Mon cher chou did not like his fish, although I thought it was well seasoned.    Dessert was awesome-- peanut butter pretzle chocolate heaven.  So the food is good, very good even, but not great.  THE SERVICE:  The front of the house was comically incompetent.  This is really unacceptable in a place that does not take reservations. (one star off for no reservations, automatically!)   First, one woman takes your name, then stares at a book for a really long time.   If you ask her how long the wait might be, she will tell you one hour, always.  Then, when it's time for your party to be seated, she whispers to another hostess.  That hostess stands there, terrified.  She then meekly walks about the room until the first hostess gets impatient and points out the proper party.  The second hostess then stands there looking at the party to be seated until said party eventually stops talking and wonders why there is a woman silently staring at them and eventually asks her why she is staring at them.  Our waiter was all right.  He was personable and knowledgeable, if a bit forgetful.  At the end of the meal, he ordered the busboy to reset the table and asked us if  we were ready to order yet.  This is just downright odd for a Symon place.  His wait staff and front staff are usually top notch.  I'm going to chalk this up to growing pains and hope that in time, this place works out its opening inertia and grows into what it absolutely could be."}
{"text":"We were inexplicably out at Avon Commons this afternoon, and in dire need of sustenance decided to make the quick trip over to Bar Symon for a late lunch.    We walked in at the perfect time just as Dinner was starting and the place was mostly empty aside from a few tables and the bar area.   We were promptly seated at a comfy booth and began to peruse the menu.    The House chips appetizer was ok, but the real star of that show is the beer-cheese fondue the chips are served with.  A little more of both would have been welcome.    As I write this, I must confess that I didn't want to brush my teeth so that the lingering flavor of the Michael's Glory sandwich could stick around my mouth a little longer.  Beef Tongue, Pierogi, Horseradish and \"marrownaise\" on grilled bread with a side of fried Brussels Sprouts.   It  was heavenly.  Gf really enjoyed her Lola burger as well.    An increasingly fussy baby (ours) and a couple of full bellies (also ours) kept us away from the dessert menu, but I hope we'll be back soon.    Overall it was a very pleasant experience, and I am really glad that Chef Symon is diversifying his restaurant portfolio to include some moderately priced options.   Food this good for this reasonable of a price is a wonderful thing to have in our supposedly miserable city and its adjacents."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lola fries with rosemary and parmesan, and the grilled chicken breast sandwich. There were sparse showings of the rosemary, and the parmesan looked like it was just dumped by the bucketfuls on the fries. The flavors were there but they didn't stick on the fries and seemed like a waste especially for how expensive these ingredients are. I ended up using the coffee bbq sauce and lola ketchup, both of which I enjoyed. If you order fries for yourself, be aware that there are enough for 3-4 people. As for the grilled chicken breast sandwich, I asked for no cilantro. The waitress did hesitate for a second and then replied that they could do that though I said to her I would order something else if they couldn't. When I received my sandwich, there was still remnants of cilantro in the guacamole (I'm not allergic but just thinking if I were!). The sandwich was big though didn't have a lot of flavor. And the waitress was slow throughout the service.  I just came off of reading Michael Ruhlman's The Soul of a Chef which features Symon in the second section so I was excited to eat here but left disappointed and $30 poorer."}
{"text":"You'd expect an airport restaurant to have fast service. Not the case with this place. It took 20 minutes to bring out food by which time I had to eat and run."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations for airport bar food.  This will be my go-to place when passing through Pittsburgh airport.  I even ate all the coleslaw, and who does that!"}
{"text":"Hate to give such a low rating for any place.   Burn here is the deal   2 star down for food. Ordered veggie burger and what I got was similar to frozen pattie at Burger King. Onion was so big and raw , no cheese or dressing. It was dry. Probably Burger King ( which I hate ) could have done better job.   2 star down for service.  Had to find server after ten minutes to find it whether I will be served. She was not sure Soni ordered at bar. When food was ready they called me to pick it up. While others were being served.  There were 8 people in kitchen and 6 on serving. More than total customers. Not sure what's up with them.   One star up for fries and ketchup."}
{"text":"Nice to have a good spot in the airport. Nice breakfast selections not run of the mill. Great burgers nice staff. Worth it for sure in an airport. Thanks MS"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast before a flight. Ask for gravy with your eggs - very good! Coffee is nice as strong. Service is attentive. Love having breakfast here."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Michael Simon does it right.  You have to try the fried brussel spouts!"}
{"text":"Only at the airport do you pay $12 for just a burger. With that being said, this is my favorite place if I have to eat at the airport. The Parm Rosemary fries are delicious, service is always good and the bartenders are even better."}
{"text":"They seem to have changed their menu a lot in the past few years, with some good results: the burger I had, which had goat cheese and an egg on it, was tasty. And the non-alcoholic mixed drink (a mojito, if I am spelling it correctly) was enjoyable.  But the best part was that the server, and the chef, were very helpful with assisting me in selecting an item given a nitrate allergy; I got an item without any nitrates in it and therefore had an enjoyable time. They showed a greater awareness and concern than most restaurants I have encountered. I'll go back if I get the chance when I am in the Pittsburgh airport."}
{"text":"Meh. My turkey burger had no flavor whatsoever. The parmesan thyme fries were okay, but nothing special. And please, if you're gonna try and get fancy with your ketchup, do it right! Their version of ketchup was not good. I'd like my Heinz please!  Service was prompt, so that's a positive if you're in a hurry. I guess what truly disappoints is that I passed by here all the time when I was in a rush to make a flight, thinking maybe I'll eat here someday, looks good. But then when I had the opportunity to, it just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I fly through Pittsburgh it is great. Good selection of draft beer, oversized sandwiches and good burgers. The fries and pierogies are also excellent as is the tomato soup. You will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Michael Symon's third Cleveland restaurant gets two thumbs up from this guy.  This place has really great food and a really neat decor.  You can tell some of the stylistic elements from Lolita's are carried over but the restaurant still has its own feel.  They have a long list of unique beers all the way down to the coolest bar feature. $1 PBR drafts all the time.  While I don't know that I'd ever order it, I think its nice to have a permanent special for those who might be interested, especially at a nicer restaurant.  I would say because of the location it is the most casual of Michael Symon's restaurants but that doesn't mean the food is anything but good.  Now to the good stuff, the food.  For appetizer I had the Bone Marrow which I first experience a few weeks prior at Lolitas.  For those of you who are freaked out by it let me first say that the taste is not very strong at all so if that is what is keeping you from trying it then I say dive head first and try it.  The only potential hold up is if you are finiky about textures it does have a gelatinous texture that some people may not enjoy.  That said, it isn't all that noticeable on top of the toasted bread they give you to eat it on, which is outstanding.  Our table shared the double cooked chicken wings, which I'd say were the best wings I've had, EVER.  They stand on their own wonderfully without being smothered in sauce, they were very meaty with little fat.  For Dinner I had the Pork Butt with the side of the Bacon Creamed corn.  The Pork butt was very tender, moist and tasty, but not the largest portion, however it was more than enough after all the appetizers we had.  The pickled cabbage slaw was a nice twist, even with be not being a huge fan of cabbage.  The bacon creamed corn I thought was outstanding, for those of you who get scared by the notion of creamed corn it was nothing like you'd expect, not super rich, it was more like bacon corn with a bit of cream.  The corn was nice and sweet with a nice citrus finish.  Dessert, yes we had dessert too, was the Guinness Pretzel Sundae.  The bitterness of the Guinness ice cream was complimented by the sweetness of the chocolate sauce and saltiness of the pretzels.  Overall I'd recommend, I made the trip from the East Side and I would make it again to try it again."}
{"text":"I am really paranoid when flying because I'm always afraid that I'm going to miss my flight... but I had about three hours before boarding, so I decided that I could sit down somewhere to eat. I chose this place since airport food is always super overpriced, so you might as well go somewhere that's worth it.  I got the Fat Doug with a side of rosemary fries (the fries were extra). The Fat Doug consisted of a burger patty, pastrami, and cole slaw. I thought it was super delicious and even though it was a little on the smaller side, it was definitely enough to hold me over for a while. They also give you a lot of fries but I wasn't really a huge fan of the rosemary. It didn't taste bad but I'm one of those people that would just prefer plain fries. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and am glad that I chose to eat here because it was really tasty. I think I paid $18 for the entire meal to-go and not including a drink; so it's definitely not the cheapest option, but it was tasty."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place and was super excited to try it. We came here very early on a Monday morning, and the experience was rather unremarkable.  As a moderately health-conscious person, I had a hard time finding a good option, but I blame that on myself - I should have known what I was getting myself into. I finally decided on the granola, but when I ordered I was informed that they were out. I had to scrap with my plan to get in a healthy, hearty breakfast and went for the Spinach Feta Breakfast Sandwich.  The OJ took a while, so we sarcastically questioned if they were hand-squeezing it. Well, they were, and it was well worth the wait. The breakfast sandwich was also very good, and the side of fruit was nice and fresh.  I think I would be happier here if I were able to drink (which I am not in the habit of doing at 6am before a business trip), so I should probably come back for dinner sometime. I will update the review if I make it back."}
{"text":"I think Michael Symon should have to eat here weekly as punishment for inflicting this restaurant on the flying public.  This looked to be the best solution for dinner on my unplanned routing through the Pittsburgh Airport.  Things looked promising, but went kind of downhill from there.    I was seated quickly (the one plus).  Sat down and was greeted by a waitress who seemed to lack any enthusiasm for the job and wanted to get away from the table as fast as possible.  After I looked around at all the other waitstaff, it seemed to be a common affliction.  None of the waitstaff seemed to have the least bit of interest in being there.  As for the food.  It was embarrasingly bad.  I expected more from a restaurant than this.  I ordered the Lola burger and the rosemary fries.  The burger was a bland mess.  Starting with the patty, which appeared to be pre-formed  standard, institutional looking uniform patty.  Overcooked and totally lacking in flavor.  It had some good looking thick sliced bacon on it and I was excited.  It  didn't last long, as it was flavorless too.  How do you mess up bacon?  The fries were right in line with the rest of the meal.  They seemed slightly stale (i know they had just been cooked), a bit chewy I guess?    I would say go to TGIF's or McDonalds instead.  You will pay half or a quarter of the price for food and a tenth of the apathy.  I really wanted to like this place.  Good airport food is lacking all the world over.  Hopefully, they pay attention to Yelp and make some improvements."}
{"text":"So I travel all the time for work. And have been oddly waiting for a flight delay so I could finally get a chance to eat at the infamous bar symon! Obviously a big cleveland fan and was pretty pumped to get to try this one out. I had the perogies and kielbasa. SO GOOD! What was even better, is they served platform beer! So good and so pleasantly surprised. Great job Michael Symon. We really needed a nice spot in CLE."}
{"text":"This just happened a moment ago.  I was going bAck to ATL after 3 weeks of the worst food ever.   I decidedvto go to Bar Symon's.    However, I didn't eat here.    Told the hostess I wanted to see a \"to go\" menu which was right in front of her.  She directed me to the menu on the wall.   ?????  I then told her that I was ready to place a to go order.  She advised me that I could sit at the bar and a server would be there or I could sit at s table.  Did she not understand?  I repeated myself twice.  At this point, I didn't want to eat here.  Just sensed that I wasn't welcomed to even place a to-go order there.   Too bad. I was a fan of Michael Symon.  Looked forward to trying this award-winning burger."}
{"text":"Tried breakfast there today.  Had the pancakes and bacon.  It was OK, the bacon consisted of just two pieces.  I asked for black tea, but they were mysteriously out of black tea and only had green tea - how does that happen?  My colleague got a number 1, which was toast, potatoes, and eggs.  Her toast was served completely burnt (black).  I called the waitress (Melissa) over and said this was not acceptable and ask for a replacement for my coworker.  There was no apology or explanation, though it was promptly replaced.  Breakfast, for 2, with tip was almost $38, kind of pricey."}
{"text":"Parmesan fries, 1.5lbs chicken wings and a Mule. I can confirm that I boarded my flight a happy man."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to checking this place out on my recent trip from Pittsburgh to Atlanta.  But sadly it was quite disappointing.  The food was good, but nothing short of average.  It's definitely better than any other restaurant at pgh int'l airport, but I thought it would be something special since it was a chef symon restaurant.  We got a turkey sandwich and pulled pork., A order of Parmesan fries and siracha wings.  The best thing was the siracha wings, very interesting and unique.  However after a few the taste got kinda bleh."}
{"text":"Awful.  The food is average but service and detail are very lacking.  As a frequent flyer, I've visited this location probably 5 times, but today will likely be the last.  Understaffed, overpriced and lacking in almost every way.  I witnessed the manager and wait staff scrambling around the restaurant in a sad attempt to keep up.  And there was probably only about ten tables full, less than half the restaurant."}
{"text":"Writing this review seems almost futile, because this place is closing on October 30th, and since all of the suburbanites decided to forgo eating at chain restaurants once the closing date was announced and make sure they ate here once before it closed, the wait for a table might be somewhat long.   However, if I didn't write this and encourage you to drop your dinner plans for the next two days and do everything in your power to eat here before it closes, I would be doing my fellow Clevelanders a disservice.  I've been to Lola once, Lolita twice, and B Spot four times. None of my meals at any of those places have been anything less than spectacular. My meal at Bar Symon, though, beats them all.  We went there on a Thursday to celebrate our 6 year anniversary of being together, and the wait was an hour long. No biggie--we put our name in and drive down the street to John Chris Winery (which I've reviewed as well) and shared a bottle of wine. We would have waited at the bar but it was packed 2 deep...and there is NOTHING I like less than eating\drinking standing up for hours at a time. When we got back, our table was ready.   I had heard from everyone imaginable that their fried chicken was great, so we got that. It was as good as advertised, with a subtly sweet breading and a delicious sauce. The fried chicken came with cheddar biscuits and some sort of greens that I didn't eat because I was too busy eating the next dish I'll describe...  We also got the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich. When our waitress described it to us, it sounded like something we could get from Panini's, and I wavered, but my wife (Sheila F.) said it sounded great, so we got it. I am so glad we did. Seriously, this pulled pork tasted like it had just come straight from the smoker...I can't describe how good it was.  I would have loved to devour the entire dish but I was too full...and I know that now that all of the flavors have had a night to soak together, the sandwich just might turn into the best leftovers ever. It also came with a side of dill pickles (probably homemade; Michael Symon has a recipe for them in his cookbook), his awesome homemade chips, and pickled red onions, which were unique and yummy.  The fact that anonymous, cookie-cutter, sterile, unimaginative restaurants at Crocker Park like Brio, The Cheesecake Factory (which is the Milli Vanilli of restaurants...it's just a big fraud), Hyde Park, T.G.I. Fridays, and Applebee's are packed on the weekends while places like Bar Symon are closing is a crying shame. It's not like Bar Symon is any more expensive than those places, and I cannot fathom why people would not want to pay decent prices for mind-blowing food. Michael Symon deserves better and I hope that he is able to re-open this restaurant in an area where people have the willingness to venture out from the ordinary and the inclination to try new foods and make their eating experience glorious exciting instead of simply something that one does in the evening when they get home. Sure, I was part of the problem--I knew about it for years but never went there (mainly because it was a very far drive) However, I was going to all of his other restaurants in Cleveland while most residents of the western suburbs who live minutes from Bar Symon were busy enjoying mass-produced cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory, warehouse-made Italian food at Brio, and factory-made burgers at T.G.I. Friday's. This is a harsh review, but I think it's disgraceful and disgusting when a high-quality, reasonably-priced, kid-friendly restaurant closes and places like The Cheesecake Factory and T.G.I. Friday's that are the Nickelback of restaurants remain open and thriving."}
{"text":"We live in NYC, but our heart is in Ohio - Go Bucks!  The Cleveland area has always been home to excellent dining and this is an excellent example of what it is capable of. It is is some random shopping plaza in the western burbs, but is worth a visit (if it doesn't actually close)."}
{"text":"Bar Symon seems to be the epitome of hearty gourmet at least as far as airport food goes. I recently dined here with my mother, and I have to admit it is our go to place in the Pittsburgh airport. The ingredients are quality and the food is definitely tasty, but there's nothing truly light about this restaurant. Even the salads are massive and loaded with protein. I always leave Bar Symon feeling heavier, which should be expected especially if there's a sandwich with pierogies involved. Don't get me wrong, even though my stomach was bulging, I'll still go back for another burger!   *Important: the cocktails and bar are great! Not to be missed if you're weary traveler in need of a quick pick me up."}
{"text":"I was heading to LAX from Cleveland Hopkins and was excited to eat at Bar Symon.  It was such a huge disappointment.  Great beer list. However, ordered a cheese burger with bacon and it came out in about a minute.  I said how did they cook it so fast?  Bartender said it was probably cooked for someone else. Bacon was raw. I took the bacon off. Cheeseburger was cold.  It probably could have been good if it was hot.  I didn't complain or send it back because I didn't want to be late for my flight.  All the condiment bottles were filthy. Michael Symon would have been appalled if he had the experience I had.  Someone needs to oversee the restaurant.  It was awful.  I will never go back and I fly out of that airport at least once a month.  They need to be aware that the quality fell very short of Michael Symons standards.  Horrible experience."}
