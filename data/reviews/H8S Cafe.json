{"text":"Locals all and sundry waxing poetic at the first café to open in Lachine. All fine and good, but their choice of Phil and Sebastian ethical beans from out West is not bitter, it is sour. As in lemon juice could have been added and I would not have been surprised. As there is only one bean on offer, you had better be prepared to like it."}
{"text":"Tout ce que j'ai à dire : ENFIN un petit endroit chaleureux à Lachine où il fait bon savourer un délicieux café!"}
{"text":"Tout petit café à Lachine sur le bord de l'eau. Personnel sympathique, café délicieux et pâtisseries de chez Rustique. Ils ont ajouté plusieurs tables à l'intérieur pour l'hiver et un menu du jour avec soupe, grilled cheese et salade. Pas mal pour le latte art aussi. Option sans lactose pour ceux qui préfèrent."}
{"text":"J'adore !! Bon café, beau décor. La petite Annie était très sympathique. Je recommande"}
{"text":"Cute and small cafe in Lachine along the water. Great location to stop for a coffee while out on a walk. It is pretty small and there is limited seating inside and outside, so this is more for a quick stop or to take on the go during a walk. We grabbed some coffees and then sat in the park across the street right on the water."}
{"text":"Yay!! Coffee shop in Lachine, to my knowledge it's the only one. Well it's sort of a coffee shop, they don't offer coffee here, it's not that kind of coffee shop. They do not make cold brew here either, or frappiccinos, or mochas, and they are only open till 5:00pm. So don't plan on coming here after work or as a bike destination in the summer.   Yay!! I guess it's an espresso shop in Lachine with weird business hours.  To their credit, they partnered with Rustique bakery and no joke, because of this genius business move, this coffee shop now has the best sweet treats of any coffee shop anywhere in the city. I just wish I could get a cup of coffee or some cold brew to go along with them.  This cafe has also partnered with its neighbor to offer affogoto's! There is a short, short list of people selling this product in this city. It's just kinda weird they have different hours and you have to get your ice cream from one place and run next door for the espresso.  The title \"cafe\" evokes an image of a place that sells coffee and sweet treats, possibly a small snack (they do sell grilled cheese Sammie's and they looked good). I can't recommend this place yet, not until they sell coffee, and enjoy selling the cafe, coffee culture.   Americano's are not a substitute for drip coffee, I don't know where this idea came from."}
{"text":"Joli petit cafe ouvert depuis à peine 2 jours. À proximité du canal Lachine et des pistes cyclable, le café est le seul endroit dans ce secteur de Lachine ou il est possible de savourer un bon cafe dans un bel atmosphère. Une petite terrasse est aménagée juste sur le trottoir. Le décor est simple et moderne. Le service fut amical et chaleureux par la Barista. Mon café était chaud mais un peu trop amer a mon goût. Ou amer même pour un cappuccino. Il faut faire attention aux merveilleux parcomètres sur le boulevard saint Joseph. Ils sont très gourmands."}
{"text":"Small cozy coffee shop just off the water.  3-4 tables with 6 bars stools.   Small selection of breads, muffins, squares etc."}
{"text":"Chouettes produits vegan, bon service, belle ambiance!"}
{"text":"Cozy and nice little coffee shop by the water.  Went there the first week it opened and wasn't wowed by the coffee...2 other tables sitting outside were not impressed by their coffee either.  I will give it another try later and see if any improvement."}
{"text":"I've been going to this cafe for about a year now and i dont want to change places. The lattes are great, they now offer vegan pastries as well as normal pastries. Their coffee was my favorite thing about this place until they changed it however it still tastes good and their hot chocolates are creamy  and decadent."}
