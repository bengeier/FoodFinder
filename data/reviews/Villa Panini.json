{"text":"Classic Panini at its finest.   I was checking out the Instagram posts for the past few weeks and I had to come in for a bite with a friend.   At first I didn't seem to be to impressed with the place other than it had a cute patio and a nice sign.  The management behind the counter were extremely nice and the food coming out looked really good.   We had the Chicken and Eggplant Panini with the works. Including the homemade Bomba.    The food is fresh and yummy.  And did I mention that it was a full size portion. For the area you are getting a sandwich for the Hungry Man.  This is no wimpy Panini.   Then there was the rice balls. Wow. Big and with 3 choices.  We had the classic cheese only and a second one with Rapini.  Covered with the house sauce which is a simple and again classic.  And I am quite sure it was home made sauce.   The coffee here was an excellent finish to a meal I could barely finish.   I didn't see any sweets on the menu but a biscotti or canolli would have been a nice way to finish this meal. (Hint hint)  At the end. This place is not fancy at all but you get great food, price, value, that you can not go wrong.  An excellent lunch place in Maple."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place at work, and ordered a chicken breaded panini with eggplant and mushrooms for lunch.   I believe the only sauce is the tomato sauce (but I could be wrong) and you can adjust the spiciness level. I got the medium and it was the perfect amount of spice for me.   When I opened the foil wrappings - The sandwich was huge and fully stuffed with toppings. It was perfectly cut in half to make it easier to eat.   Normally I'm not a fan of eating sandwiches for lunch, but this totally changed me...it was delicious!   I'm planning to check out the shop the next time I'm in the area and have my boyfriend try it :)  I wish it was located downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"OMG... These veal sandwiches are so delicious... I inhaled it!    I am so impressed with the veal sandwich.  Treat yourself and get the extra toppings.  You will for sure be happy you did.  The generous serving and heaping toppings will make your tastebuds dance!    The hours closing hours may disappoint you.  However, you must understand you are getting fresh, hot, quality ingredients and an amazing bun to indulge your veal sandwich and tomato sauce.    The sauce will not leak through the bread.  It IS the best tasting veal sandwich!    I can't wait to have this again.  For any veal sandwich lover out there, like myself... This is \"the\" gem.  The price is reasonable for what you get... a masterpiece of flavor and texture and I am going to dream of this tonight for sure!  Thank you and my tastebuds and stomach thank you too!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch before our flight.  Ordered the grilled chicken panini with onions, a hot pepper based spread and the provolone cheese with BBQ sauce. Chicken was cooked perfectly and overall it was an enjoyable meal.  My only criticism is that the panini was larger than the filling so there were some bites without chicken and the other toppings.  Good place, very friendly and good service."}
