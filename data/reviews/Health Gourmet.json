{"text":"Food here is advertised as MSG free but, not SALT-free lol.  From the taste of the dishes we got, it does seem like they hold true to their advertising.  

We came here Sunday night for dinner and the place was pretty busy.  Dishes came out pretty slow and the portions were slightly smaller than other restaurants.  I do have to point out that Sunday (Sept. 7/14) was a special occasion in the Chinese Calendar (Moon Festival) and reason why it was so busy there.  

They have 2 different prices on the menu.  If you purchase the VIP (for $20) card, you automatically save about 10-15% on the regular menu prices.  The VIP card does make sense if you order about 5 dishes or more (it pays for it self already).

The peking duck (in my opinion) is pretty good but, not as good as Dali's but cheaper.  Other notable dishes, the sweet and sour pork which came in a half fresh pineapple and the beef cube with broccoli.

Will I come back... yes.  I will try to come here on a non-Chinese celebration time to see how good the service is.  Today was not fair to judge the service of the restaurant."}
{"text":"0 star. I would go lower than that if I could. Worst dining experience ever in Toronto. Bought a 45 dollar value coupon of dinner for two. One of the three dishes came with ONLY four thin slices (size of small Doritos chips) of eggplant on a iron plate which was not even heated. Never going back."}
{"text":"Ive never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. This is the first time I've ever not given tips. I went here with my mom and we ordered our food. We got food that we did NOT order. And were FORCED to pay for it. Our food that we actually wanted did NOT come and no one even told us. The waitress was actually YELLING at my mom. She purposely gave us our change back in quarters. I can't believe how terrible the service was. Never coming back, DO NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Please do not waste your time and money here. After my previous experience (when I posted the tip during our 45-min wait for the food), my dad decided to give it another try because he reasoned, \"maybe dim sum will be better^. The staff were rude once again, nothing changed there.. I had to wait for someone to take my filled dim sum sheet (even though the place was practically empty) and after 20 minutes of just waiting for our food, a server asks, \"have you ordered your food yet?\" ARE YOU SERIOUS?? We ended up getting up and walking out. This place does not know how to do business."}
{"text":"We were attracted by the ad and their name, healthy and no msg. The decor is ok and the waiter has no smile on his face but its ok , we come for the healthy food. We order a combo which included steamed fish, bumpkin with mushroom, steamed chicken with cloud mushroom, wok fried squid with celery and soup of the day, with tax and tips, we pay $ 85 for 4 of us. The price is not the lowest, but its still ok if the food is good and as healthy as its name mentioned. The food is worse than average restaurants in Scarborough, its still ok if the food is healthy. When we come back to home, I was so regret we had gone there. I was so thirsty than ever  I had dinner in other restaurants before. If they are what they stated no msg, they must put a lot of salt in the dish.
If you want service, dont go there. If you want taste, dont go there. If you go for the price, dont go there. If you want healthy food, you must stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here.

Need to highlights few things, first off...they have a \"VIP\" membership that cost $20 to join to get special discounted pricing on the menu.

It's full price if you do not purchase this \"VIP\" membership, this involve you just paying up $20, they don't care what you fill out on the so call form they give you to fill out. 

We had dinner for 4-6. \"VIP\" pricing $48 dollars, non-VIP $68.

This dinner includes:

Vegetable soup 
Peking Duck (2 courses)
Scallop (canned) mushrooms with baby bok choy.
Gor Lor Yuk
Deep fried salmon belly with Salt and pepper 
Sweet tofu dessert

Only dish that was descent was the peking duck itself. The garnishing vegetables the provided was dry and old. Looks to be prepared from a day or so ago, the scallions and carrots were dried out. 

Salmon dish was dry, very dry. Over cooked.

The gor lor yuk dish...no meat to little meat. It's like eating a sweet sour dough ball.

Definitely not going again, once is more than enough.

As for decor, sea foam green, plenty of empty walls... Of sea foam green. A few \"chancellors\" to scale up the place.

Check out the photos from other reviewers and you will get the idea."}
{"text":"Never again.

While the wait staff were friendly the kitchen is slow.
In a Chinese restaurant, the food usually comes together and everyone has a feast. This place is SLOW. The food trickles in one item at a time, the next item not coming until you've finished the previous and have waited awhile.
Been waiting 1.5hours for our entire order to arrive. When the food does arrive it isn't even hot!!!
The portions were small and we are leaving hungry.
The restaurant wasn't even full, it was half empty.
Avoid this place unless you enjoy waiting and leaving hungry.

Edit: 2hrs now and been told we still have one more item coming when I asked for the bill. I asked why it's so slow and got a look that says...\"I know but....\""}
{"text":"Bad service. Slow and disorganized in serving food. Servers don't clear dishes when you're done causing tables to be full one more food arrives. Two of my items actually never even arrived. We went up to the cash and that took about 10 more minutes just to cancel the two items. Dim sum is traditionally a very quick affair during a very busy serving time. However this place took forever to bring out each item even if they were very common dim sum items. When they arrived at your table the servers take forever to check the items off of your list.  Chinese restaurants are mostly known for gruff but efficient service. But the service here was gruff and really inefficient.

They use some kind of system where they put receipts on top of the steamers so when the items arrive the receipts or slips of paper are really soggy on top of your cover of your food. The food itself was actually good but I would not stand another visit here because dim sum took twice as long. 

Beaware - don't bring any relatives from out of town whom you want to impress with Toronto's dim sum scene. Totally not typical of Toronto's Chinese restaurant offerings. Will not be returning again."}
{"text":"???? ??? ??...?????...???????? ??????????... we got here at 1:10 and waited until 2:00 before the waitresses even served us a single dish. Super slow service and food is very subpar. Also had to remind the waitresses that we were still existent"}
{"text":"Servers here were so rude! They put us at a corner table next to a huge crowd of diners and we were squished against them. We saw that there was another free table elsewhere so we asked them to switch but they refused because they said it was too busy (it was a Saturday but the table was free, so it shouldn't take that much effort on their part!). They even told us that we should be grateful to have a table at all! The food was okay but the service sucks!"}
{"text":"My only experience at this dimsum restaurant is a lot different from other reviewers' experiences. I came here with my family (there was 8 of us) and the staff had no trouble accommodating a table for us (although this was during a Monday early lunch). The food was good and service was OK. They didn't ignore my table (probably because my father is quite loud and gets attention easily lol). Dimsum here is relatively cheaper than a few places I've been to. So far, I would give it 3.5 stars. I might go back just to see how my next experience differs from my first. Hopefully there is a consistency."}
{"text":"Misleading advertisement. 
1. They mention all dim sum $2.38 each, but actually it is only for member. 
2. They have a daily special, but only after 10:00am. 
3. The dim sum order paper is complicated, there are different price all over the paper.
I won't go again"}
{"text":"This place is brutal on so many levels.  

No greeter.  You walk into the restaurant, tables are not cleared.  This place honestly has no staff.  My family sat for almost 30 minutes and no tea.  Seriously?  How are you even in business? 

We ordered a set menu at a very reasonable price.  I guess you get what you pay for.

The free soup was lukewarm and for a table of eight people, each person has enough for half a bowl.  The table next to us had two people, and they were served the same sized serving of soup!  This made no sense to me at all.  

These were the dishes that came in the set menu:

Mixed veggie plate consisted mostly of celery.  A few snow peas, thin king mushrooms, and a sprinkling of some sort of nut/bean?  I guess this was alright.

Duck Peking style.  This was decent.  Served with mediocre crepes and accoutrements including cucumber, onion, carrots, fried things, and hoisin sauce.

Beef.  Not tender but it was edible.  Served with broccoli.  Average dish.

Sweet and sour pork.  I didn't eat this but it looked pretty generic.  

Steamed fish.  Not fresh.  It tasted dirty.  

Fried lobster with little fishies.  This was decent as well.  How is this healthy though?  It's clearly fried!  

Fried rice with lobster...  What's that word???  You know, the greenish stuff inside?  This dish was alright.

Duck, second course.  In sauce with tofu.  The presentation of this one looked like slop.  However, it tasted pretty good.  

The main problem comes back to this place being totally understaffed.  People had to get up to ask for more water for tea, for containers, for utensils, etc...  So many tables were not bussed because they just didn't have any workers.  Do you expect customers to come back when the service is so slow and inefficient?  

This place offers a VIP card so you can get discounted prices on set menus and 10% off on regular menu items.  I guess that's the only way they get repeat customers.  

I feel sorry for the few people who do work here though.  I wish your employers would get you some help.  

I'm not coming back here."}
{"text":"The dim sum is good.  It's made WITHOUT MSG, which is always a plus.  Healthier dim sum that is still tasty.  Multilayer cake is so delicious."}
{"text":"Was there on the Saturday of the Father's day weekend.  First impressions were not impressive.  The decor was plain and bland.  Oh yes, the food was plain and bland also.  The decor reminded me of an extra-large food court which was not appealing for a sit down restaurant.  Service was average given there was a full house.  I'm not a fan of this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is decent enough for my family to come back about 4 times when other restaurants are full. All four times we came they're always out of stock on something. Today, they were out of chicken and told us to choose another dish from the menu. Countless of selections later due to many items being out of stock, we ended up getting cheaper dishes.. I don't understand how as a business you can run out of items on a holiday. Do they not expect the amount of people coming in for holidays? I do not recommend, please stay away. The place is not very healthy gourmet at all."}
{"text":"Came here for a dim sum breakfast this morning (Sunday). Got here at around 10am and there was no wait for a table!  They have a large selection of dim sum for you to choose from on an order sheet. On weekdays, most dim sum items are $2.58 each and on weekends/holidays, it goes up to $2.78.  On the order sheet, it has a lower members price, but I am not sure how one can become a member.

Food was average.  The har gow had good flavours, but the dumpling skin was sticky and it started falling apart when I went at it with my chopsticks.  Their molten egg yolk bun was below average as the filling was watery and not very flavourful.  The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf was good and had lots of filling. The tea provided was not very hot.

I probably would not come back here for dim sum as I can get much better food for the price I paid."}
{"text":"So. Terrible.

1) Awful customer service - angry, inattentive, sloppy waitresses. They all had expressions on their faces that said, \"Why am I working in this hell hole\". No smiles were to be seen. 

2) They have \"VIP\" pricing vs. regular pricing displayed blatantly on their menu - who wants to see that?? It's unprofessional. 

3) We went for lunch at 12:30pm and they had NO fish, lobster, or other seafood available. Granted, this is when diners generally have dim sum but wouldn't you want at least the option?

4) When we were seated and they gave us spoons, they literally threw the spoons into our bowls from shoulder level, chipping one of them!

5) Food was mediocre at best. 

The environment was generally uneasy and uncomfortable. I have never eaten at a restaurant that made me feel like I wanted to leave immediately."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like it's vacant because the windows seem to be taped with cheap paper. Came here for dim sum yesterday morning around 11am Saturday. The place was busy but there were several empty tables. 

The decor is kinda tacky. Chandeliers, high ceilings, green coloured walls and exposed wooden beams was just a weird combination. They even have an outside sink just in front of the washrooms for you to wash your hands.

Decor aside, this place is clean. Service is prompt. Price range is from $2.78 - $3.99 for S-XL dishes. Membership at this place will give you a approximately $0.20 discount per dish. 

Not a bad place, but nothing to write home about either.  I may suggest this place if you're craving for dim sum and don't wanna wait forever on the busy weekends. My dad frequents this place and says 90% of the time you'll get seated right away. I guess not a lot of people are aware of its location, and if they are they probably think it's a closed business."}
{"text":"Dim sum here is average. It's a made to order dimsum restaurant and quality of the items are ok. Prices are cheaper if you have their vip card... which I believe is 20$ a year.

Lots of mainlanders here and the staff speak mostly mandarin so if you speak canto it's a little hard to communicate. Staff are not happy all the time and will sometimes not take your finished dishes away.

Lota of tables and can get busy on weekends for dim sum."}
{"text":"Very bad service it took 35 min for the first item to arrive and this is dimsum. The dishes are dirty and poorly cleaned. The hostess gave our table to another group even though we were there first, she gives us a bs excuse saying they were a larger group but our table was the same size. They need to improve"}
{"text":"Well, there is nothing really special about this place, let's be honest.  Health Gourmet prides itself in creating dishes without a lot of salt or MSG, but honestly, I did have a taste of salt in my mouth after the experience. For dim sum, the selection were pretty standard. I would not say that it has the best dim sum I ever, but certainly it was not the worst. The service was very average, at best, depending on the time of day it is when you dine at the restaurant.  The interior of the restaurant is very spacious, but I wish they can still do a lot better in terms of creating a more classic environment in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not the best dim sum but not the worst. 

Food: You have to know what to pick here, not everything is great and not everything is bad! I would recommend the deep fried dough rice rolls, durian pastry (tastes like durian but the usual durian taste isn't too overpowering) and the custard buns (I order this every time and it never disappoints, the custard melts out of the bun). The usual hai gow, siu mai and rice rolls are fine. I wouldn't recommend the pineapple bbq pork buns though. I've ordered it twice and both times I wasn't impressed.

Service: It's typical Chinese restaurant quality service. Yes, the servers aren't smiling and yes, you will sometimes need to stick your arm up or out to get some service but you will always get what you need. 

Tip: Make sure to check that everything you have ordered has arrived before you get the bill. Some dishes take forever to come out and on many of my visits I've had to ask them to cancel certain items as I was done all my other food and feeling full and didn't want to wait for the last dish. The servers never put up a fight about it and will remove it from the bill.

Full disclosure: My parents have a membership card there and we get 10% off which is why it's sometimes our default dim sum place to go."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. I have gone to this restaurant around twice with my family and we were treated respectfully. 
However when I went with a group a friends, the staff and esp. the waitress showed us no respect. When we walked in there was no one there to greet us, the service was absolutely horrid. Twenty minutes into our meal, we were presented with the bill, which was completely rude. The meal cost around 70 dollars flat but I paid 80. After paying the bill, I was not given any change as if the waitress thought that they deserved way more than 10%. This service was not even worth 5% of tips. 
After forcing us to pay for the food early, they proceeded to forget one of our orders and left us waiting for 20 minutes for one dish. As the meal was coming to the end, no one was there to serve us at all. Towards the end of the meal, the place had also forgot to serve us our dessert. 

Honestly, the food is decent but the service is terrible. I would not recommend going here there are so many better Chinese restaurants in Toronto. The staff did not treat my friends with any respect and we left feeling angry and upset. Needless to say, my day was completely ruined because of this crappy service. 

I would have given this place 0 stars if that was allowed."}
{"text":"I'm a major potty-mouth but I'm going to keep it clean for a fine website such as Yelp. Decor is whacky. Place is spacious. Lack of employees. Even the servers complain. Service takes way too long. Why I am here? I have no reason. Maybe it's something called Family Day. - Update: Confirmed. Owner is from China. The servers are complaining that they're 'worked to death'. Typical and shameful. - Second update: Reduced to a one-star rating because one dish did not come and they still added it to the bill. They did not get a tip. No offence to the employees who work there. To the owner...YOU SUCK - TOTALLY! (Trying so hard to refrain from curse words) - The people of this city...Oh heck...This country...Do not deserve your ways of operating a business. Total shame on you!"}
{"text":"This dim sum restaurant has a special setup: it is a mainland Chinese managed restaurant that specializes in Hong Kong style food. Given this background, however, they have mastered the dim sum cuisine very well. The English name \"Health Gourmet\" is unfortunately a misnomer, it has nothing to do with healthy foods and the like. I only ate lunch here so far though, so I cannot say about the dinner experience.

Ambience: this restaurant has a different atmosphere compared to traditional dim sum restaurants - there is a lack of ornaments and style that makes it seem like a fancy canteen, which it is not. There is definitely a northern Chinese influence in the decorations of this restaurant, and the intent of this design, in my opinion, is to show that they provide quality foods at an economical price. The washrooms have an amusing setup as well, with the tap and sink installed outside of the washrooms.
2.5/5 stars

Service: Servers overall appeared courteous. Most of them only speak mandarin, and would not understand if you speak any other languages. The food was promptly delivered and it did not take too long for the bill. However, do not expect a fine dining experience.
3/5 stars

Food: I came to this restaurant several times and I never had the negative experiences that some of the Yelpers had. There is a great variety of dim sum choices compared to other Chinese restaurants of this size. The siu mai (??), and har gow (??) were ok. I really enjoyed the durian pastry (???), it was a delight blend of durian paste inside a crispy dough exterior. For those who don't like durian, the deep fried tofu with spicy salt (?????) was a very nice treat. The tofu is quite airy inside (imagine the aero chocolate, but instead it's tofu), and the tofu was dipped in the sweet and spicy sauce, while maintaining its crispy exterior. As for dessert/sweet dimsum, I really enjoyed the steamed bun custard (???), the paste actually flows into the mouth as you bite on it, so be aware of it getting to your clothes! The delivery time for the foods was definitely not bad, it was standard timing. I would say the food is actually the strength of this restaurant. I would not call it an exceptional quality, but definitely decent quality food.
3.5/5 stars

Price: very economical, especially for dim sum of this quality. 

Health: eating dim sum is of course not the healtiest, with much of the meal portions consisting of protein and carbs, and less vegetables. However, it is a personal choice of which dim sums to eat and manage. If you are looking into healthy options, I would get the chiu chow dumplings, Japanese style steamed tofu with shrimp, and the seafood dumpling in soup. I can't really say if they avoided putting MSG into their foods as they claim, as I can't tell by the taste alone. 
3/5 stars

Overall: This restaurant is an enjoyable experience to those who enjoy decent quality dim sum at an economical price. Best suited for the family gathering or the small family lunches. Recommended dim sum: dumpling pastry, deep fried tofu with spicy salt, and steamed bun custard for dessert.

Overall rating: 3.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"So much for \"health\"...

It was advertised that it did not add MSG, but I think it contains a lot of MSG, or a lot of salt or some kind of additive. I came out of there very thirsty.

I can only give credit for the Peking duck.

I'm not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"I feel that their regular customers aren't the type to leave or read yelp reviews. This is why I was dragged here and saw a full restaurant, despite the 2 star rating. This place is like typical mediocre Cantonese restaurant. Their customers, servers, decor, and music are all Cantonese diner style. The best part is that there is no line-up for weekend brunch times.

I recommend: shrimp dumplings, custard buns, ribs"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews that people have posted for this restaurant, it made me feel that this isn't the place where I want to be dinning in. But as for my experience this time, it was actually very good!!

I came here on a Sunday night for grandparent's birthday. We had called earlier to make a reservation and also telling them what we wanted to order since we ordered off one of the set dinner menus for 6-8 people.

The location of the restaurant itself isn't hard to find at all, literally just the first one to your right once you turn into the plaza. But as for the entrance, it wasn't big or obvious and only had a little sign on the door saying Health Gourmet. There's a lot arrows along the side of the building leading you to the entrance and it's exactly like that with the restaurant beside it too, so it makes it a bit confusing.

The place inside looks extremely empty like a food court, interior design is none, no decorations whatsoever and just boring green paint all around. They have a seafood tank on the side near the entrance to the washroom, which looks kinda sketchy because it's dark and looks musky too. The bar/cashier looks unfurnished with no additional lightening showing that it's a bar that serves alcohol.

The dinner combo we ordered came with soup, Taiwanese tofu stir fry, stir fry mixed vegetables, 2pcs of big lobster stir fried in garlic, steamed fish, honey garlic beef cubes, Peking duck, stir fry Peking duck and vegetables and sago taro coconut milk dessert.

Peking duck and lobster were my 2 favorites:

Peking duck - they roll out the freshly cooked duck on a trolley and you can see the waitress thinly slice off each piece of duck along with the crispy skin onto the plate.  Then they bring a bamboo steam basket with small pieces of wraps for the duck, it's steaming hot, so it's so soft. They also provide with condiments that you can choose to put inside your wrap, like hoisin sauce, green onions, carrots and crispy wonton strips.  It's like building your own taco but with cripsy duck skin and duck meat!!

Garlic lobster - the portion size of the 2 lobsters that we had were plenty, we had 7 people and we could hardly finish it with each having over 5 pcs. They chop up the lobster into smaller pieces where it's so easy to eat, you don't really need to get your hands dirty. It's fried off first then stir fried with garlic afterwards which makes it so flavorful! 

The dessert was disappointing because it was flavorless and tasted watered down. But like any other Chinese restaurant, you can expect the dessert to taste good when it's free.

Since it was my grandmother's birthday, we told the waitress before dinner and she timed it perfectly to give us a complementary steam bun stuffed with red bean for her birthday! 

***Steamed bun with red bean that looks like a peach on the outside is more of a traditional Chinese dessert for older people meaning to wish them a longer life***

Overall, the food wasn't bad, especially for the price we paid. The whole dinner set cost $138!!! I would definitely come back to eat if it's with a group of friends that wants cheap, good, Chinese food.

And as for service, we constantly had waitresses checking up on our table refilling our tea pots with hot water, clearing empty plates from the table, switching our side plates filled with lobster shells. 

I also saw their menu for lunch where they serve dim sum, I would say it's the cheapest in town, $2.18, that I've seen. I would be coming back for dim sum if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"First of all the name of the restaurant is called Health Gourmet....there is nothing healthy about dim sum..So it's a weird name. ( So after reading others reviews, notice that they are trying to be a healthier dim sum place, less salt, less MSG and oil. But I still find the food lacks flavour.) The decor is also totally a mix mash of everything....warehouse ceiling and fancy chandeliers....the only good thing is the restaurant is very spacious.
 

They are way under staff on Family Day...the dim sum itself is mediocre. Service is not that friendly either. Staff themselves are complaining they are overworked and under staff.  

We arrived here at 9:45am or so. Order was punched in at 10:19am...we are still here at 11:15am and still waiting for the rest of our order. We decided to leave and didn't want to wait for our last order of Haw Gao. But they charged us for the dish that didn't arrived. We decided to just not pay tips and leave. Even though they had service button at each table. No one comes when the button is pressed.

Oh another thing was, we were missing 2 bowls and spoons when our food arrived (we just noticed it).  The waiter came with the bowls but didn't look happy to give it to us.

I also went to the washroom to check it out. The toilet paper wasn't even in the toilet roller. It was just left on top of the toilet. The tap water was cold, no hot water at all and there wasn't even paper towel or a hand dryer at all. 

We also notice they using the bottom cart to transport food to tables. I think it is kind of unsanitary to use the bottom cart....cause it's way too close to the ground. People walking by, dirt and dust can get all over the food.

There was also another table that I noticed that came later than us. We ordered before them and they got all their dim sum and even left before us. While we were still here waiting for the rest to arrive to our table. Plus their table was even a bigger group then us.

Don't think we will come back again..since we can get better service and food elsewhere."}
{"text":"The owners are so nice and friendly. The food is great and I love the fact that it's healthier (less oil, less salt, & no MSG)."}
{"text":"Was here during the snow storm and we almost had the restaurant for ourselves. Ordered the $108 dollar deal that feasts 6-8 people. The offer was found on their advertisement from the newspapers.

Comes with fish stomach soup, broccoli beef, zucchini and fish, garlic vermicelli lobster, whole chicken, tofu shred lamb hot bowl, mushroom efoo noodles, and comes with rice and dessert.

Pros:  Overall, the good was pretty good, as compared to my previous visit a couple of years ago. 

Cons: The only concerns are the air temperature being too cold, and the washroom had a distinct foul smell.  The lights were half turned off.  This could be due to cost energy saving tactics.

Decor: local Guangdong province restaurant feel"}
{"text":"Came back here recently. I think they got worse but people still cram this restaurant on Sunday. They don't have much staff so you'll find yourself waving them down for more tea or even the bill. The owner is really nice to her customers, she always comes by asking how the dishes taste. But I have to lie that it tastes good."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. We were a group of 5 on Saturday night. Place was fairly busy, but not full. Ordered a steamed fish and three other simple, straightforward dishes. The steamed fish arrived 30 minutes after ordering, but It took us an hour from ordering to get the rest of our food -- and we still were missing one dish! We finished all of the food before that last dish arrived, so we sent it back out of pure frustration over how long it took.


The food couldn't be more polarized. It was either bland or ridiculously salty, though the fish was decent. The supposedly healthy dishes were not palatable, while the marginally palatable dishes didn't seem to be healthy. I don't know what these guys are trying to accomplish. As far as service goes, it was pretty standard, and courteous as far as Chinese places go.

They have some serious work to do in their kitchen. Too bad I won't be able to see their progress because I've vowed never to go back."}
{"text":"We went there on Christmas day, and this decision ruined our Christmas completely.... We were kind of surprised to see what they put on our table."}
{"text":"3.5 stars; we enjoyed it more than other reviewers. This place is not that fancy with plainer decor, but dim sum was decent with reasonable prices and portions. Appeared to be run by mainlanders. There was a discount for earlier dining (pay your bill before 11am). Located in a plaza; no problem parking."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in years. The staff is rude. We were inexplicably denied switching tables to one of the numerous empty ones not in front of the gusty door area (it was so cold we had to eat with our winter coats on). How did they watch us eat in misery and not care at all. 

Food is mediocre but took a long time to arrive. Never cleared out empty dim sum plates, but instead just piled on new food on top of empty plates. Asked twice for a fork, and only got a plastic one both times. The reason was that they didn't have any clean ones left. Over the course of an hour, they couldn't wash one fork to give us. 

Would not recommend to anybody and definitely will not frequent again!"}
{"text":"It sucks, the service sucks, the food was meh and I'm never coming here again

We ordered a set meal so we had no idea what type of dishes to expect, the waitress gave us the wrong order and didn't realize until later then asked us to pay half of the wrong dish, even though it was their fault in the first place. She insulted us by taking the half eaten dish away , because she rather throw it in the trash. 

The place was very deserted during dinner hours, restaurant vibe was cheap, not only did the waitress try to argue with us she did not apologize for her actions."}
{"text":"Do not come here. This place is ghetto and the food quality is very low. Cleanliness is low, even for chinese restaurant standards. HARD PASS."}
{"text":"January 2014 jot notes:

2 stars. Nothing extraordinary. Everything is just 'meh' from start to finish. Kitchen staff dropped off the complementary soup for us and left. We figured we had to it ourselves? lol. Another staff saw us and quickly came over to serve us but seriously rushed her way through, spilling soup all over the table -_- I rather just do it myself, thank you very much. Kitchen staff continued to flop down the dishes and left without saying anything. Found a piece of plastic in my food, yay. Extremely short staffed this evening consider that this is the day before CNY. No one really checked on us throughout dinner. My mom gave in and joined the VIP program for $20. Lots of discounts for dim sum and dinner. Expires in 2 years. But can't use towards holidays including the Chinese ones. WTF. It was not even the acutal CNY Day. Expensive meal.

March 2014 jot notes:

2.5 stars. Friendlier service and much more attentive!! Staff carefully served us hot complementary soup, and later offered to refill our bowls instead of doing it ourselves *thumbs up*! Dishes promptly arrived right after we finished our soup. With the VIP card, the ??????? (Peking duck 4 course meal) is only $48 #greatdeal (non-VIP is $68). First time I had it, the duck was tasteless. This time around, the duck had more flavour - I'm glad they made improvement. But I'm still shocked (both times) to find out that they don't have or serve plum sauce for the duck! RAWR, I want my sauce :( Other dishes were pretty much average stuff. Oh, the sweet and sour pork felt like it was reheated - the meat was tough and was drenched with yucky, sour sauce. Complementary red bean soup at the end was served hot but it was too water down for my liking. Sigh. Let's hope my next meal gets better."}
{"text":"After hearing the bad reviews I was indeed skeptical. The interior decor is above-average for a Chinese restaurant and quite clean. In terms of dinner, the stir dry mushroom and beef we ordered was overpriced and small in portion, made to look larger due to the large plates used. The pork with celery and mushroom was a better deal though. The food not bad but was rather bland (perhaps in support of the healthy eating/no-MSG eating the name refers to?). The tangsui was dilute and cold. The service was really bad, given how simple dishes took a half hour to be doled out to us. Overall, good decor, overpriced, bad service, and average food."}
{"text":"This place is spacious, lots of seating. Decor doesn't really make sense with fancy chandeliers and bright green chairs but that's not the worst thing about this place. Came here for dim sum and the service was so painfully slow. Not enough servers and the employees they do have dont have a clue about anything. Dishes that we ordered two of only came out in singles. Food was mediocre at best. Rice rolls were the best thing that came out (when they eventually came out). We ended up leaving and asked for the dishes that never made it to our table to be removed from the bill. This was a painstakingly long procedure even though it was just two items. This place is just really disorganized. 

There's this VIP card program which you can buy and allows you a 10% discount off the food for a year. Even with this discount, it's not worth it.

You know this place is bad when a worker here serves you your food and asks you why you're even eating here when there are better restaurants nearby with similar pricing and better food. Thank you for your honesty lady and your recommendations. Would not come back here."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. We waited for almost an hour, and we made a reservation! The waitress only gives seat to people who speak Cantonese, and those people arrived after us and they don't have a reservation.  So we just left with really bad mood and starving. Never gonna come here again. The waitress also have a quite attitude."}
{"text":"3 star, extra 0.5 for Durian Pastry...... 

Health Gourmets promoting health eating by using better ingredients, less oil, salt and no MSG. 

Interior deco is quite pleasant with spacious, open concept with green and white colour theme. 

Dim Sum serves till 3:30 pm with a smallish menu but quite sufficient as it has my favorite durian Pastry!!! Price is on the higher end in the area $2.50 (VIP card holder at $2.30) and $3.50. 

Steamed Shrimp and Chives Dumpling ($2.30)

Steamed Beef Roll ($2.30)

Durian Pastry ($3.50)
- Freshly made and I can smell its aroma feet away.. 
- So flaky and puffy.... And the creamy filling just oozing out
- LOVE, finger licking good...

The other 2 are quite standard but the portion is good since it is the healthier version, the taste is more subtle. 

They also serves Cantonese dishes during dinner time. 

I probably will come back again for dim sum... Healthy dim sum...."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum with my family last weekend on Sunday afternoon. Apparently the place is supposed to be healthier than most other Chinese restaurants, as they try to use less oil, less salt, and no MSG in their cooking. After reading multiple Yelp reviews, I went in with really low expectations, but it turned out to be okay. The dim sum food is pretty average, but not terrible. I can't really attest to whether it was actually healthier, but it wasn't too oily or anything, and it still tasted fine, not too bland. Prices are a little bit steep though compared to other dim sum places ($2.80/dish) and also considering the whole look of the place... I mean, it's kind of interesting that they don't have it decorated like a traditional Chinese restaurant, but everything about it just looks so... tacky. Lime green tablecloths, fake leather looking green chairs, peeling/cracked walls, plastic curtain things over the front door (like those ones you see in the fish/meat section of Chinese supermarkets). It basically looks like a converted warehouse (exposed piping and vents on the ceiling and all) that they filled with really cheap, tacky green furniture. I know it's the food that should matter the most, so for that I would give it 3 stars because it's pretty standard and supposedly healthier I guess. But given that I could be getting similar quality dim sum at cheaper and better looking places, I can't really see any specific reason for me to come back to Health Gourmet."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a Wednesday night cause we wanted to avoid the weekend dinner crowd. As suspected, the place was quite empty and so we assumed service will be pretty fast...boy were we wrong. They served the first few dishes really quickly and then had a huge wait gap in between for the rest. Most of us lost our appetite waiting. We had to ask several times for the food until we finally got it. The food was at most mediocre and not even really \"healthy\". The real cream on top though was they HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL US OUR TIP WAS NOT ENOUGH and we needed to leave more. I don't know what world they live in but TIPS are for good services AND UP TO CUSTOMERS DISCRETION. never coming back here again!"}
