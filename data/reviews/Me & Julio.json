{"text":"This place is so great. The shrimp bang bang tacos are a 5 star for sure! Friendly staff, reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and the whole place is underwhelming. Nothing here is exceptional in any way. Cuban sandwich is ok. Burgers are piled so high that they are hard to eat. Cocktails are basic run of the mill stuff, but the staff struggles to get them right. It is hard to sit on the west-facing patio in late afternoon due to the heat. Parking lot is a little tight so cars spill over into neighboring businesses. 

I am really hoping they survive in this location as Fitchburg needs more dining options but they have work to do here."}
{"text":"Would you enjoy a little animal cruelty to go with your tequila? What's next, cock fighting? Unbelievable that not only did the owners not quickly escort their friend out of the restaurant, but in fact appear to be only concerned about the safety issue. Apparently there were no worries, after all, their jaws were TAPED SHUT. This is disgusting and cruel. It speaks volumes of the characters of the owners. They should be fined, and the money should go to a wild animal sanctuary.  My money won't be filling their coffers....."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now (all for Tuesday night trivia). Overall everything has been quite positive: The tap beer selection is plentiful and diverse, the trivia (Tuesdays) is entertaining and competitive. The decor and ambiance works... it's got the tex-mex type flair but in a tasteful way. You'll see. My wife and I regularly decide to get the nachos which have yet to disappoint. I am telling you - get the half order only. Seriously, the half order is PLENTY and you would easily be able to share it amongst four people. 
Yes, the half order can and should feed four. 
We did have one instance of shotty service - the waiter was awkward, ignored us for a portion of the night and we ended up reaching out to another staff there to get our last round of drinks and then pay our tab. Other than that we've been pleased. I certainly intend to go back."}
{"text":"There was 4 of us in our party.  We started with the cheese curds.  Best tasting cheese curds in Madison!! They were freshly battered and fried.  We tried the different flavored margaritas, I loved the spicy one the best.   I had the buddy bowl.  It included grilled chicken, seasoned grilled walleye, and seasoned grilled shrimp, served with fresh flour tortillas on a bed of seasoned rice.  I loved the flavors of each item and it was drizzled with a rich cream sauce that was very tasty.  Others ordered the chicken burrito, grilled chicken salad with avos, and a taco bowl.  They all loved them and I took pictures because I was SHOCKED at the SIZE of the Taco Bowl.  HUGE!.  We ate outside and it has an AMAZING FIRE PIT."}
{"text":"Only been once, and wanted to give it a few weeks before coming to let them work out the kinks. First impression was the decor, which was cantina done well, with a partially open view of kitchen. Came on a Sunday evening and had to wait 30 minutes, which was expected since it's quite new. Bar service was good, and the house margarita was decent--reasonably priced since it was happy hour (all day).  Popcorn while you wait was unexpected, but tasty and made with coconut oil, so at least it was done right.

Overall the food was pretty good, and priced for what it is. Fish tacos weren't exceptional, but the chicken fajitas were cooked perfectly and not smothered in sauce. I enjoyed the refried beans, but the borracha beans were lacking, well, beans. Rice was a little bland like rice at Mexican restaurants always is, but wasn't overcooked like most of them. No complaints about the service though.

Menu could use some focus. It was half Tex-Mex, half American, with some Cuban inspired dishes sprinkled throughout, along with classic Wisconsin fare (curds of course). My advice, take 10 things and make them amazing, instead of a smattering of 30+ dishes you can find down the road. Won't be a regular, but will give it another go at least."}
{"text":"Not so hot... I ordered the chimichanga and it wasn't my idea of what it should of been. My pinto beans sucked and the veggies on the side were decent. My friend got a burrito that looked good, so if I do go back (unlikely) that's what I would try. Since I'm not knowledgeable about \"authentic\" Mexican food I can't say for sure, but my assumption is probably not. The manager was very nice, but our waitress was mediocre."}
{"text":"So far the food has been delicious, the service has been terrible.  I think this place is still figuring out how to run smoothly and has yet to weed out the slacker servers.  Don't come here if you're in a rush, you'll be frustrated."}
{"text":"We live in the hood, and REALLY wanted to like this place. After two visits here's what we came away with:
The refried beans taste like hot dogs. Seriously off putting.
The rice is always cold
The prices are ridiculous. 13.00 for two enchiladas, cold rice, and beans that taste like hot dogs. No Bueno.
They're lunch prices are the same as their dinner prices ( except the soup and salad combo)
On the upside, my shrimp tacos were pretty good. Overall, we may come back for a drink... But probably not for the food."}
{"text":"Great take on south western food and fabulously friendly staff! The outside patio is a great time and best of all, dog friendly. I see only good things for this place as they get into their groove."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the steak fajita. Broad selection of items. Large generous portions. Delicious popcorn. Very friendly service staff, especially Jaime."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for the half price classic margaritas on Tuesdays and Thursdays! The free popcorn is a nice touch. The food is hit or miss. I enjoy the sweet potato fries, puffy tacos, and quesadillas. The LuLu burger and breakfast tacos were pretty bland. I will be back since this place is close to my house and affordable."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Southwest and know what Mexican food is supposed to taste like. Me & Julio reminds me very much of Pasquale's, and not in a good way. Both try and be all things to all people, bridging the gap between Mexican and American food. Neither delivers on their goal and what I have always ended up with is very unmemorable Mexican food. The Buffalo Bites appetizer was the best thing we had but otherwise, meh!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way back from Milwaukee to Iowa and absolutely loved it. Their salsa is so fresh, unique and delicious. The soft shells used for their bang bang tacos are homemade and pull it all together for the perfect bite. Then move onto the margaritas...the lemon basil Marg is fantastic not to sweet and tons of flavor. The jalapeño one is the perfect amount of spicy. Great atmosphere inside with amazing seating outside. If I lived here this would be my new spot, go check it out!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Amazing! My husband had the fish fry, he is a fish snob & he loved it, as well as the slaw, tarter & beans. I had the bang bang shrimp tacos, fresh & delicious. This place is a must."}
{"text":"We enjoyed eating here. They did a good job with the decor and ambiance. We ate outside on the patio, and while it wasn't great facing Fish Hatchery, the road noise wasn't awful and trees and flowers and such were nice.

I'm a bit surprised by some of the other reviews that gave such negative reviews of the food. We had the fish and shrimp tacos, and they were pretty good. Fish had a nice crispy crust, and the shrimp had a good sauce. Service was friendly, prompt. We also had a couple margaritas and they were good. Passion fruit was a bit sweet but not over the top. I had the platinum one and it was good and strong.

The food seemed a bit overpriced though. Not terribly outrageous, but enough that we probably won't come back too often. The happy hour deals are a bit more reasonable. If the food was a step up more, the price would have been ok, but just seemed a bit over. Would have given 4 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"I've been here 6 times since my original review, so I think it's fair to give an honest review of our experiences. I've eaten here for lunch and dinner, and have had dinks with each dinner. The chicken tortilla soup is great, the Reuben is serviceable, but everything on the Mexican side of the menu that I've tried is awful. The last experience was steak fajitas, and they were covered in a sickly sweet sauce, more like a Chinese meal than a Mexican or even Tex-Mex dish. That will be the last time we have food here. It's also worth mentioning that the menu is overpriced by about 20%. There's a lot of overhead built into their pricing. 

Table service is consistently good, but the bar service is definitely lacking. That's different than most other establishments, and is worth paying attention to for management."}
{"text":"We try to get together with our 2 children and their \"significant others\" once a month and decided to try Me & Julio. They open for brunch at the atypical hour of 9:00am and they offer a wide variety of both breakfast and lunch menu items. For traditionalists they have an omelet bar and the standard egg and meat platter. For the more adventurous they offer breakfast tacos and two very unique \"hash\" offerings. The food was very tasty, the service good (even though out waitperson was helping to serve a group of 14 next to us) and the portions were very large and potentially shareable. The down sides were the high ambient noise level which made conversation at a table for 6 a bit challenging and coffee that was overly strong and served with grounds in the bottom of the cup. Other than that we'll probably add Me & Julio to our list of brunch stops in the coming year."}
{"text":"Seemed kind of dead at noon on a Wednesday.  Food was OK but that's about it. Even though its close by, not sure I will come again soon."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. The restaurant was full on a Friday night. Food and service was just fine. Perfect for a night out. Love the front porch."}
{"text":"I wasn't disappointed with the food at Me & Julio, but I wasn't overly impressed either. I had an orange margarita- which was very tasty, and not overly orange-y. We started with the chips and queso/guac, which I also enjoyed. The chips were light and not too salty. However, the queso was lukewarm at best and the guac had started to turn brown. It was half price at happy hour though, so I guess you get what you pay for.
For a meal, I ordered the bang bang shrimp tacos. Again, not bad, but not entirely impressed either. They could really up the flavor if they added more cilantro and bang bang sauce and if they pickled the carrots. 
Not sure if I'd come again. I think there are better Mexican food options in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times since it has opened and have never been disappointed! They have a great mixture of Mexican and American food, and a variety of margaritas and other drinks. I love the atmosphere and the patio is big with a beautiful fire pit. I will definitely keep visiting!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were down here on a business trip. We are from the twin cities area and have been to the Me and Julios in Hastings MN. We started with cheese curds and burnt pork ends. Both were amazing. The portions are large so don't be afraid to split a meal. We split a beef chimichanga and it was excellent. Our server Heath was good and very courteous. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"As most have said, the refurb was done with great attention to detail and style, shame they neglected the food.

We tried the Mexican side of the menu and was severely disappointed. 

I had the fish fry and the fish was clearly frozen and deep fried, the fries were also frozen and most were not cooked through. The beans were defiantly out of a can. 

My wife had the fish tacos and she barely ate them. Again, all frozen-deep fried food! 

Odd that a chain Mexican is just down the road and all the ingredients they serve are freshly produced. Why can't this establishment raise the effort and do the same. 

I fear for the long term future unless they up their game. Right now they are surviving on being able to sit outside, come the winter and based on current offerings, there is nothing to bring me back when the temps drop."}
{"text":"Sorry, but Me & Julio fell way below the standard for even mediocre food.  First...  What's up with the popcorn?  Okay... so it is a balance between Mexican and American... well maybe, but isn't it so American to understand that you always get a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa at an American Mexican restaurant? Even my 11 year old grandson wondered about it, without my commenting first.  Enough about the popcorn.  

My son ordered a burrito.  He said it was okay.  It was prepared opposite of what is typically expected...the vegetables and salsa on the inside the meat served over the top of the burrito.  My daughter ordered chicken fajitas.  She had nothing good to say about the dish.  The chicken looked and tasted as if it was prepared in a bag cooked in a microwave. It was not fizzling hot when it was served.  The tortillas (which we assumed was flour) were awful.  No one could not tell what they were made from. The beans had an extremely odd texture.  Probably the worse plate of fijitas we have ever experienced. 

My mom ordered French onion soup... really... haha.  What is French onion soup doing on this menu?  Doesn't matter, but of course it received a mediocre rating as well.  She also had a taco salad.   She did not comment on it.

I ordered the salad with chicken, goat cheese and figs.  Dressing on the side.  Of all the dishes served, this was actually pretty good. Not excellent, but good.  

All in all, we all agreed this was the last time we would be dining here.  We all agreed, Me & Julio's has been the worse Mexican restaurant we have experienced."}
{"text":"Wishing they pureed the salsa with those delicious chips and didn't charge $5 for them. It's more like pico, but worse. Wishing they flavored their taco meat and shredded chicken better. Super bland puffy tacos. I was sooooooooo excited about them because nobody nearby makes fried crunchy shells and I make them at home often. So I was obv disappointed . Even the guacamole was bland. I don't understand. Also, beware, they put raw jalapeños in the salsa and guac and the rice was clumpy and had weird, dark things in it. It made me think that it was scraps from someone's previous plate. I wouldn't even try it because I was scared. And I love trying everything! My husband got the chicken chimichanga and it was actually pretty good. Hence the 2 stars, but we won't be going back. Ambience was cool for a happy hour gathering but skip the food or just be drunk first. Sorry owners. I'm not usually harsh but I had my hopes up about you. My bad, I guess."}
{"text":"We came for the live music, which was great! I love that they have bands there on the weekends. But the food and drinks weren't great. I had a margarita which was way too sweet. I sent it back, and they remade it the same. They are pre-mixed so there's no room for change. The thing is, in Madison, there's an incredible craft cocktail scene, so the competition is stiff and many of us don't want an overly sweet pre-mixed drink but a legit, tangy, margarita. The chips and salsa were also mediocre (compared to places like Eldorado Grill, Tex Tubbs, Laredo's). I'd try it one more time for dinner in a pinch, perhaps after they've had a little more time to grow."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and it's always good, nothing amazing, but good.  The food is decent and consistent, and the staff is always friendly and attentive.  It is very kid friendly (they have a kid's menu and give coloring crayons, as well as a big bowl of suckers at the front door).   The bowl of popcorn is great to tide kids over until the food comes as well.  The food is good but don't expect to be blown away.  The portions are good sized as we always leave with enough leftovers for another meal.  It has become a staple in our lunch routine simply because it is fast and we know what to expect every time."}
{"text":"Me and (my husband) Julio had to come here JUST because of the name!!! I love Mexican and American food and this place is amazing! The fajitas were on point- fresh, super hot and the tastiest Mexican food we've ever had! Definitely recommend this place! I also got a t-shirt!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch today and was really impressed. The place is gorgeous and they did a really nice job on the remodel. We got there at Noon (Friday) and were seated right away. Our servers were really friendly and service was quick, always full drinks. 

I had the Cuban sand which and my friend got the pulled pork tacos. Portion sizes were huge!

The tacos were 3 very large tacos, tons of meat. I was impressed. The Cuban and sweet potato fries were delicious and more than I could eat for lunch. 

We had no service issues, our food was speedy and delicious - we both said we'd definitely go back. 

And you get free popcorn when you sit down!"}
{"text":"We went as a group of six, so had a chance to try quite a few things. They were quite busy for opening night and everything seemed to run quite smoothly and was very tasty. Fried pickles and burn ends apps were amazing! White sangria was super yummy. Bang bang shrimp app/tacos were also very good...I thought they were a little too spicy for me, but my hubby loved them. Chicken fajitas were well seasoned and the BIG burrito was in fact huge! Younger daughter loved the Mac & Cheese. Older daughter got the beef quesadilla app for dinner...she didn't like the \"sauce\"...it was the marinade and was quite tasty, but seemed a bit greasy. We will definitely be back and can't wait to try brunch this weekend."}
{"text":"Food was AWFUL.  Tasted like cafeteria food.  Life is too short to eat food this bad.  Overcooked and flavor was just horrible- definitely not house-made.  Could have cooked a better Mexican-American meal at home ourselves.  Also, the margaritas were gross- very salty, low on alcohol.  Will definitely not be returning to this place, and definitely do NOT recommend it!  Waste of money and a Friday night.  The one star is for the service- friendly and efficient, that is the only positive comment we have about this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice twist on same favs (eggs in the Spanish Rice) and jalepeno's in the beans.  Great blend of Tex-Mex and American (though I prefer the Tex-Mex). Went for lunch and food was quick (food ordered and in front of me, cooked from scratch in less than 8 minutes)."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for an early lunch during the week after Christmas. We had been to the location when it was Veranda, and knew the building had changed hands a few times, so we were cautiously optimistic. The new owners did a fantastic job with the renovations, and the inside was thoroughly and tastefully decorated for Christmas. 

Now, the food was good but not great. I don't have much to say about it. What did send me here to Yelp for a review was in the bathroom. Imagine my surprise when I went to the restroom to change my baby's diaper and found a FULLY STOCKED changing table, complete with diapers, wipes, and hand sanitizer. I was floored. Talk about going above and beyond. Someone was in the stall of the men's room when my husband went to investigate, but I imagine the same exists in there. As a parent of two small children, extra touches like this are greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a much needed reunion with some friends. Our waitress was so sweet and very personable. She stopped long enough to chat with us, and we never felt rushed. Music played in the background, and whoever was picking the music, knew the right tunes to our 90's hearts.

I ordered the jalapeño and mango margarita, which sounded tasty in theory but fell kinda short for me. The cheese curds were excellent, fluffy and cheesy, just how I like em. For dinner I had Boom Boom Shrimp tacos with a side of rice and beans and the tacos were were SO amazing!! I also ordered a smaller dish of loaded mac and cheese, and holy cheese, broccoli, and bacon heaven!

We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, decor and service.   Suburban location is no  excuse for chain like vibe.   Yuck."}
{"text":"Their weekend brunch menu is great. I always get the Cajun hash that is an omelet full of chicken, shrimp and sausage covered with hollandaise sauce on top of hash browns. Yum. Way too big for one person so I always ask for a box and take half of it home. My husband loves the breakfast burrito and says the chorizo in it is perfect. That is also so big he also takes Home half of it. 

When the weather is warm, we like to sit outside. The patio is really nice but could use some umbrellas."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place out for a while since it opened up just down the street from us. The restaurant has a great atmosphere when you walk in. The layout is meant more for gatherings and casual encounters than it is for a romantic date. The bar is smack dab right in the middle of the restaurant.

My wife and I both started with some margaritas. They have several \"special\" drinks but we opted for the standard. The drinks were pretty tasty for rail tequila and they were mixed strong.

I ordered their wings with Sriracha honey and my wife got the chicken tacos with their \"Bang Bang\" sauce. The wings were good but not great. The sauce however was very good. The \"Bang Bang\" sauce was also very tasty. We both were very disappointed the tacos came with a chicken tender in the middle instead of shredded chicken.

We finished with some fried ice cream. Vanilla ice cream, fried shell, drizzled with honey.

Overall, the food was decent and the drinks were good. I was impressed with the sauces. Nothing had a \"wow\" factor to it. I would go back mainly for the proximity to my house and have some of their Happy Hour specials."}
{"text":"Opened only 1 week. We decided to give it  a try despite some reservations about wait times. Patio area looked full when we drove in but we were surprised. Read on. 

First, finding their parking lot wasn't as straight forward. You can get to it via the children's dental center or CDW. We took the latter. 

We were asked if we want to sit outside or inside and we opted for whichever is first and got our booth inside right away. 

In less than 10 mins we were served by a smiling bubbly waitress. She said she is learning and she could have fooled me. Efficient in taking our orders and checked in continuously throughout our meal. We are not dessert people but she convinced us to try the fried ice cream. It was good. So good service and no wait time even though the place looked crowded. There were a lot of wait staff also. I noticed tables were cleared quickly as well. 

On to the food. Two of us shared an appetizer of pork burnt ends and an entree (buddy bowl). The burnt ends served were real meaty. I'm used to the fatty, caramelized ends so this was s change. They serve the good stuff. Buddy bowl came with shrimps, blacken catfish, chicken, rice and 4 flour tortillas. The latter looked home made and smallish. Tasty food. 

I would come back to try the other dishes. According to the wait staff, the owner likes American food and her husband likes Mexican food and thus the theme. Very nicely decorated inside and out. Check it out."}
{"text":"Ok nacho lovers. I dare anyone to find a better, bigger plate of nachos for a reasonable price anywhere else. And if you get them at Happy Hour? Oh my!!! Half off. 

Went to their breakfast twice and enjoyed both."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back! We were greeted at the door with a smile & seated quickly. Served fresh hot popcorn which was surprisingly delicious. The service was quick, friendly and attentive all throughout our meal. Dinner was great. The best cheese curds, chimichanga was cooked perfectly, the steak for the fajitas was nicely seasoned and tender, and if you've never tried the borracho beans, go for it. They are amazing! Save room for dessert, trust me!"}
{"text":"Living nearby, we come here often for happy hour. 

The Good: Their house margaritas come out of a tap (like a beer) but are actually quite delicious. Not super sweet or syrup-y tasting. Appetizers are discounted during happy hour and everything I've had off the app menu (except the chicken tenders) has been delicious. Tuesdays and Thursdays are 1/2 priced margs all night long! They also offer free popcorn, which is quite tasty. Their Mexican rice is probably the best I've ever had and they offer vegetarian beans, which were also good. Service has always been pleasant.

The Bad: The rest of the dinner/lunch menu. Nothing stands out, which is why we had visited so many times but never stayed. When we did, we were completely underwhelmed. My cheese enchiladas had clearly been sitting around for a while because the cheese sauce on top was coagulated and the enchiladas themselves were barely warm. My fiance's  burrito was flavorless. We were actually perplexed on how something with so many ingredients could taste so bland. To top it off, the chips and salsa we ordered as an app, came out after our meals.

We'll just stick to happy hour here and venture elsewhere for our Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Omg. We are from Texas , displaced for Cinco de Mayo day. First off they brought us a bowl of popcorn  what? Chips and salsa was not even on their radar. We ordered fajitas, puffy tacos , burrito. The refried beans tasted like ground up ranch style with rose water on them. The rice was god awful. Everything was bland and needed salt. The margaritas were ok. Take me back to Texas. Amen"}
{"text":"My wife & I have been here twice.  Knowing this is at least the 3rd restaurant to open in this building, I had high hopes for Me & Julio.  I still hope they become a nice place to eat.  Right now they aren't quite there, but nothing sticks out to me as a deal breaker.

It looks like they spent an awful lot of money on the interior.  It looks very nice; a large room with decent tables and a nice warm-looking bar.  Both times we visited the service was friendly and on-point.  More than anything else, these factors push me just above the 2 star level and into 3 stars.  Décor and service matters.

The food falls a little short, though.  On my first visit, I tried the fish tacos.  They were dry and had little or no sauce to spice things up.  Essentially, the recipe consists of a couple round fried fish sticks in a soft tortilla with some lettuce and pico.  Boom, fish taco!  Sorry, but there's a little more required for them to be considered GOOD fish tacos.

On my 2nd visit I backed off a little bit and tried the enchiladas.  It's hard to screw these up.  Every American-Mexican restaurant in the country has essentially the same recipe.  Indeed, I received what was expected.  Nothing more, and nothing less.  It was a bit underwhelming since I could get the same thing at Laredo's across the street.  But that's what I asked for.  It was fine.

My wife got the club on our first visit. She reported it was good.  On our 2nd visit she got the Taco Salad, which was huge.  It looked fantastic, but the bed of lettuce was thick and the toppings a little thin.  I'd pay an extra dollar for more toppings.

We will likely visit Me & Julio again.  Next time I'll try something a little more adventurous.  Hopefully the food will begin matching up with the Décor and the friendly service."}
{"text":"I was very happily surprised with this experience. My friends and I wanted to grab a bite to eat for the night and one of them had said that they smelled the food coming from this place across the highway. Happily sold, we headed over and I was shocked to see that it was only 2.5 stars. The place was crowded and we got a nice booth along the side of the wall. The menu features lots of tex mex, american cuisine and some specials. I went with what was mentioned on yelp and got the Buddy bowl and we all shared some chips and queso. Now, the size of the chips and queso was huge. The three of us shared and we were basically stuffed by the end, but we trekked on because as soon as we were done our entrees came out. 

Now, this buddy bowl, first of all is HUGE. I don't think there is anyone that could really finish this entire thing. but also, make sure you get some of their delicious white sauce on the side in addition to what they generously give. The flavors of the rice, cheese and all meats were scrumptious and bursting with flavor. I love making my own tacos so the fact that it comes with some nice and hot tortillas got me. I was very happily surprised with this meal and could only finish half. I asked for a box and the waitress was very nice and gave me some more sauce to go with it. SPOILER alert: this dish taste just as good the day after. I was definitely surprised by how much I liked this place. It just goes to show that it is as much about the overall experience as it is the food and the company that you had. The restaurant also had a DJ playing some great throwbacks and got us all in a great mood. The only critique I will say is that this place is a little more pricey than I would like to spend on the meal, but since I got two meals out of it and had great company to go with it was a good time. Additionally, just know what you're getting yourself into when coming to a tex mex place. note: this is not usually going to be the best mexican food of all time, so just adjust your expectations a bit. 

Happy eating yall!"}
{"text":"Cute spot; I was impressed with what they did with the place. Unfortunately, service and food wasn't great. 
We had chicken wings which were slightly under-done with soggy skin. Then we both had chicken enchiladas. The chicken was dry and there was just enough sauce to make the tortilla soggy, not enough sauce at all. 
This may sound crazy, but Laredo's is soooo much better. If you're in the area, go there."}
{"text":"Our return visit, this time with my parents, we all really enjoyed ourselves. The food was delicious and arrived quickly despite it being 6:30pm on a Saturday night, and our server was helpful and attentive. The margaritas were amazing, we each tried a different one and the blackberry one is especially dangerous--they make their own infused tequila and you hardly notice the alcohol, my Dad actually asked to make sure. We will be going here again, it's quickly become a favorite even tho we're further away"}
{"text":"How can you not like a little bit of everything?  All I have to say. Go there. And be square. It's a great place to eat and  hang out with your family, co workers or friends!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to treat me to dinner as she had gone to Me & Julio's with coworkers. I was immediately surprised by the decor of the restaurant, tastefully rustic and inviting.  Our waitress greeted us in a timely manner, we ordered our drinks and entree and we received our sodas immediately. Unfortunately, this is where the enjoyment of the evening ended. Our entrees arrived and low and behold my wife's burger was not at all what she ordered and her smashed potato was loaded with sour cream, not as ordered. I don't know if this was the kitchen, the server or what, but it was returned. In the meantime I dined on my corn shell beef tacos and non vegetarian Spanish rice alone. I don't quite get the difference between the rice I had and the vegetarian as there was no hint of any meat in my rice, if there was supposed to be. The corn kernels in the rice were overcooked and chewey, the rice was dry and the dish overall lacked any distinctive favors, bland and disappointing. As I picked up my first taco, red grease dripped from it onto the stainless steel taco holder accompanying the small pool of red grease that had already solidified on my serving platter.  My corn taco shell was obviously a standard food service shell and not homemade. Not only was the beef saturated with grease, it was also bland and flavorless. Good ratio of lettuce but lacking in cheese. In the meantime the manager stopped by and refilled our sodas. After waiting over 10 minutes my wife's replacement burger arrived, not as ordered with tomatoes on it. The manager again passed our table, this time noticing my wife had an entree in front of her and inquired how our meal was, which our waitress failed to ask. We calmly explained our experience thus far and he did the right thing by offering to replace the entree and then comping her meal. In the meantime I'm done with my meal, my wife is just starting hers and our waitress is AWOL other than delivering the check. Overall our waitresses service and attentiveness lacked and in my opinion, she was not at all deserving of the $2.70 tip that my wife so generously provided. Needless to say, our experience was not an enjoyable one and our meal was at best sub standard. The ONLY reason I rated Me and Julio's a 2 was the manager did what was right. Overall, disappointed, dissatisfied and probably not a repeat customer despite the pleasant environment."}
{"text":"I drive by Me & Julio's often. Out of curiosity, I dropped by this place without consulting Yelp. I wish I hadn't.

The ambience is classically Americana, as is the clientele. The menu is split between American and Mexican-inspired offerings.

I got the country ribs, expecting a nice generous platter as I watched waitresses deliver a gigantic taco to another table. Instead, I got a platter half occupied by my side. The other half was covered in two lettuce leaves and four sad little rib nuggets. For $16.

\"These better be some amazing pieces of meat,\" I thought to myself, remembering that I'd once been served similar-looking hunks of meat in a delicious Turkish restaurant. I bit into one. I immediately noticed that the meat was hard and dry. Disbelieving that rib meat could manage to be dry, I gave it another chance with the second nugget. Nope. Still dry.

It was a pity, because the sauce honestly had some good flavors to it, but it was difficult to forgive the texture. This problem was compounded by a serious lack of water: the cup they gave me was half ice, and waitresses didn't give refills so much as they replaced entire cups... which they never got around to offering me before I'd finished all I could eat. The only upside to the meal was that the sweet potato fries were consistently good.

After I took some leftovers home, I noticed that the leftover rib nuggets were pretty good with a glass of whole milk. There was that, at least. But my visit to this restaurant was full of disappointment."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here, food was yummy & my house margarita was NOT just another limeade! Really tasty, pretty strong so be warned. I had the Chimi sans their cheese sauce (on the side, nice chipotle heat & flavor) since I'm not a cheese sauce fan & really enjoyed it. The Husband had the pastor tacos (pork w/pineapple) which are hard to find, he really liked them. Beer selection was good, lots of tequilas on the menu, too. The patio was open, several folks were outside enjoying the sunny day. We stayed inside, FUN cowboy bar vibe & our server was charming & helpful. Plenty of TVs for sports, views from all directions. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in the Madison area for Sunday morning brunch. Huge portions for a reasonable price! If you like cheesy hash browns (who doesn't) then this is the place to go. My wife, two year old daughter and I have been here many times for brunch. The service is so quick. We were in and out in 30 minutes. They have good coffee and good bloodied as well."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from my house, and I love that it is so close because the variety is great! Whether I'm feeling Tex-Mex or a burger, it's a great, family friendly place. The drinks are delicious as well! I love the different choices for margarita flavors. The complementary popcorn is a nice touch and yummy!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was instantly impressed with how pretty this restaurant is. That is where I stopped being impressed. We were served popcorn as an appetizer. I was looking forward to chips and salsa. Those were 3.99 if you wanted them. 
I ordered the lunch special which was 2 tacos and I thought rice and beans for 7.99. It was actually 7.99 plus 2.99 for the rice. The waitress did not tell us that. The tacos were good. Rice and beans were the average processed sides. I ordered an Ice tea that cost 2.95. Overall a 7.99 lunch special cost almost $16.00 by the time I left. Service was not stellar. 
This place will not make it if they do not lower their prices and hire more attentive staff."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican place in the Madison area. Great for large parties and kid friendly. 
They have a band play on weekends and the margaritas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Space is larger than I expected with a big bar in the center of the front room.  Check their schedule for live music.   Dining room in the back is quieter.  Food was decent and reasonably priced.  Good, prompt service."}
{"text":"Good bar with excellent margaritas that aren't too sweet. The food is typical pub fare with a Tex-Mex bent, but my husband and I stopped there recently for a very good Sunday brunch and to take advantage of their outdoor seating. I had never had chilaquiles before, but would recommend it. I got a huge plate of what I can only describe as a sort of gigantic, super deluxe, deconstructed tamale. All the luscious white corn tortilla was on the bottom with salsa verde, red beans, scrambled eggs, pulled chicken, and cheese on top. I ate about a fourth of it and took the rest home for some delicious leftovers. His Cajun hash - more moderate in size -
 had a nice sauce, tender shrimp, and chorizo. He said it was tasty but thought perhaps a little heavy on the potatoes, but then he almost always thinks that.

We have since been back for dinner a couple times and continue to enjoy their menu and great bar. The front room is a little less noisy than the main area, if you're eating inside. Margaritas are homemade. It's becoming a favorite."}
{"text":"Just okay. Went on the recommendation of a friend. Better options abound."}
{"text":"For how great the place looks, I wish the food was much better (especially for the price). I gave this place a few tries before reviewing to try to give it a fair shot. I want very badly to like this restaurant as there aren't many this close to where I live, but I can't say I'll be back anytime soon. 

To start, the entryway is a bit confusing. I always felt like I was in the way when trying to get a table as the only place to stand is immediately in front of the door that people are leaving through. It's too close to the seats at the bar and there isn't a clear reception area. It could use at least a host stand. 

The restaurant looks great, but is very noisy, especially in the main room with the bar. The room in the back didn't seem as loud. I didn't get a chance to sit outside (the hostess told us there might not be any tables cleaned off yet -??) so I cannot comment on that area. 

Each time I went, my server commented on how backed up the bar and kitchen were. While it's nice to know ahead of time that it might be longer than expected, it's a little frustrating to hear every time, especially to be reminded several times in one visit. Service itself otherwise was decent except my table sat with empty drinks for over 10 minutes before anyone came by to offer more. 

Margaritas were excellent. There's also a good variety of beer and other drinks. Fried pickles were also quite good. 

I'd stay clear of most of the Mexican food. The best comment I heard about it was \"It's okay...\" Fish tacos were less than exciting. Taco salad was enormous and average tasting at best. Others didn't have much good to say. If you're looking for good Mexican, head up the street less than a mile to Laredo's. 

We decided to give the American side a try, hoping for better. I went with the classic cheeseburger and fries, hoping they could at least do the basics well. I was quite disappointed when the food came out. Fries were cold and burger was lukewarm at best. It tasted okay (nothing special - standard issue frozen burger patty from what I could tell) but it had been sitting long enough for the bottom bun to be completely soaked through with grease from the burger. Another at my table had to wait several minutes after the rest of us got our food before hers even came (she got a burger as well). 

After our initial feedback, the manager did bring fresh fries out, but they were very crisp and dry inside. It was difficult to even break them in half. We were then checked on no fewer than 5 times between our server and the manager. They took a couple of drinks off of our bill, which we very much appreciated until the server reminded us of this (a bit strongly) when our bill came out. 

I really hope they work on improving the quality of the food and simplifying the menu (or at least improving the layout of the menu). The physical menu itself is quite large and I didn't have room to set it down on the table with my party of four. This restaurant could be great if they switch to simple things done well - even a build-your-own burger with options shown instead of listing 10 similar ones. Separate the burgers from the sandwiches. Use clear descriptions (is the cheese curd burger actually a burger or is it smoked ham?) and don't abbreviate (the classic burger comes with leaf and tom, the black & blue comes with a blue cheese dress) 

There could also be some improvements with staffing. Even at my most recent visit, there were several empty tables with dirty plates still sitting there. This time, the server was attentive enough to take our plates out of the way (an improvement from a previous visit when we sat with every plate we were given until we left). I also wonder if the kitchen is large enough to handle the size of the restaurant. 

Really hoping for better in the future..."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. I thought the beans and rice were bland, and my pork taco had no flavor. Good salsa and margaritas.  If I go there again, I'll try the burgers."}
{"text":"First visit here since the remodel. Beautiful! We ate at the bar and had an excellent ice cold beer in an ice cold glass. Very good. Thats the end of the nice. The Mexican food we got was terrible. My enchilada dinner looked great but had an overpowering taste of something very strong and may have been vinegar or lemon. It was in everything, the rice and refries and the enchiladas. I could not see anything that would cause this so it must be something built in. A shame because everything looked perfect, just tasted bad. Someone added too much of something to my dish. Maybe this is the normal way they do it. I would not come back to try it again. My wife had the quesadilla and was equally un-happy. There was lots of onions in it, the chicken was in big chunks rather than shredded and had so much cheese in it that it overpowered every other taste. Our server/bartender was very nice and attentive but did not come back to check to see if we liked what we got. She also didn't seem to notice that we did not eat much of what was on our plate.The taste of the enchilada gave us an unpleasant taste in our mouth that stayed with us for way too long. If you want to have a drink and enjoy the beautiful bar do so but I would avoid the food. At least the Mexican side of it. I don't know about the rest. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended, so we stopped for lunch.  I never came here in any if it's previous incarnations, and was very impressed how nice it looked inside.  The menu has quite a few choices, mostly split between American (burgers and sandwiches) and Mexican (tacos, enchiladas and burritos).  My wife nearly ordered the taco salad, but changed her mind when she saw someone else get it, and it was really big.  She ordered the pork pastor tacos.  I got the puffy tacos, and the kids got cheese enchiladas and the hickory burger.  The Mexican dishes came with rice and borracha or refried beans.  My wife and I thought the rice seemed a little dry, so we mixed it with the borracha beans, which made them taste better.  Overall, this place is just ok, and maybe a little overprice for what it is."}
{"text":"Your typical Mexican restaurant gone Americanized. Really nice classy looking decor. Alright service. Nachos were huge, but not flavorful for me to come back. I came for the margarita happy hour on Tuesday 1/2 price, which made me remember why I do not drink margs. I had two, which were good, but way too sweet, you'll be paying for it in the morning.

Weird to see they give free popcorn and charge for chips and salsa. I'll stick to my whole in the wall grocery store Mexican joints."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try this place for awhile and tonight was the night. I had the blackberry margarita which was superb! For food we had the bang bang fish tacos and the beef enchiladas. They really hit the spot. I don't normally like Mexican Restaurants but the food was soo good. We are definitely coming back. Service was great! 

Few reasons why this was a 4 instead of 5: The table was unsteady, the band duet (which sounded awesome) was a tad too loud, and there isn't a signature dish. If I could give half stars I would give 4.5.  

Try this place out!"}
{"text":"I almost *always* research a place before I go, but this one was a choice of a group of friends for dinner on a Saturday at 6 pm.  We got a large table in short order (first concern).  Then we watched a band start to bring equipment in one piece at a time (concern #2).  I figured they were going to start maybe later around 8 or 9 for the bar crowd, but nope, they were going when the food arrived.  Made it very hard to hold a conversation which was the whole point of our gathering.  And then the food arrived in waves, except for 1 person.  We waited for the last meal to arrive while our food died on the table.  It was easily an 8 minute delay, to the point where the one guest missing his meal was pleading with others to start without him.

The food was average to low.  Not much taste in the \"Boom Boom\" tacos.  It was like TGI Friday met Cheesecake Factory and Pedro's and none of it was very good.  

It just proves I should do my research before going out, as the 3 star average rating is accurate and perhaps generous.  My bad."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work for dinner, place was busy but not packed.  Food-wise this place is a standard Tex-Mex joint similar to Chili's. We had the fajitas and a burrito,  was OK but nothing special. We didn't have drinks, maybe that's the appeal of this place (or the cool firepit outside)?  Service was slow, but that's understandable given the recent opening."}
{"text":"There has got to be something good about this place ... but we haven't figured it out yet. It's just down the road from us and is pretty busy, so I really want to like it ... but I just don't. 

Pros: Decor is great; super cozy but spacious. Popcorn is a great touch. 

Cons: The food is just not good. Food service burgers and chicken for sure. I had the mac and cheese and the chicken on top was flat and rubbery. Nothing I have ever had has been memorable. 

We hadn't been there in a while, so we thought maybe it had changed. Nope. Great atmosphere and decor. Bad food."}
{"text":"This is a great property with promise.  The owners did an interesting renovation and utilized space well.  I was hesitant to go here after the alligator incident as it spoke to choices of the owners of a food establishment.  

The restaurant is ...well....kitschy.  Confusing atmosphere, poor wine choices, margaritas that are programmed, and nachos that have no refried beans or pinto beans.  The ambiance with the high boy tables resembles more of a bar than a restaurant. Maybe that is what the owners wanted.  It's not what the community needs. They claim to want to become a chain.  That is not what we need more of - we need local restaurants with less \"biker bar\" feel that more mirrors the community.   I, for one, am not a fan."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Good service.   Yummy food and more than I could eat in one sitting!"}
{"text":"They have a large menu which is mostly reasonably priced and is well executed.food has gotten better over the past year. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Drinks are average, nothing special. Still seems like a training store."}
{"text":"On a beautiful Thursday, they were on a wait for 20 minutes at peak. I think part of their challenge is they are understaffed on bus staff. I noticed tables empty slow to be cleaned and seated. Hopefully, management will invest in more staff hours quickly, before reputations are solidified. 

Food wise, we appreciated the better than normal popcorn (when the tray was not falling on the floor). Certainly, salsa and chips are often better, but good popcorn is better than bad chips.  It also helped solidify the American side of the Tex-Mex theme (as opposed to full Mexican). A little surprised that enchiladas come as a pair, not triplets but the best tasting of the bunch with real flavors layered. The fish tacos (3) better than expected (although I would prefer a little heat in the ailoi/mayo). My pork burrito with green chili sauce was fair - the pork chunks are large but overcooked, therefore dried out. I asked for more green chili and waitstaff brought chihloula sauce. The rice tasted pre-packaged. The borracho beans were good with a heavy garlic flavor. All the prices seem a few dollars higher than typical for the area and portions.

Iced tea was brewed not 'off the gun'. I hope they keep up with cleaning to keep the flavor clean. Kitchen is half open. Many big screen TVs playing a wide variety of sports (personally, I find it distracting but they seem to be everywhere these days). The place felt very spacious, and in fact felt like they had removed a few tables from the floor. I really appreciated being able to move around comfortably, and more importantly having the staff be able to move with ease and speed (it is a large place with a fair amount of space to cover) with fear of them bumping our table that is often a challenge at smaller spaces. Bar has new taps with a wide selection of local brews as well as sangria (white and red) on tap. No wi-fi and seems to be a cell light area (plus the metal ceiling).

Next trip, we are thinking of checking out the full portioned nachos that look like they could feed a few people as a meal. 

A place to enjoy some of the brief days when sitting outside is pleasurable in Fitchburg."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. They have an amazing selection of both food and alcohol! Heir nachos are GIANT and they have great specials. I especially love their patio area for nice summer nights. My favorite meal are the Sunday fajitas for 12.99 paired with a 1.00 off margarita ! Highly recommend. 10/10"}
{"text":"Holy crap, these margaritas'll knock you flat on your arse--no joke!!  Go on Tuesdays--they're like $3!!  All you need is one. I'm not kidding.  I didn't believe the waiter. My friend had to drive us to Target to sober up (sidenote: drunk shopping in the clothing section with 2 other women is not a good idea if you're on a budget).

The food was good--I had a veggie fajita. I wouldn't say it was the best Mexican I'd ever had, but I was pretty far gone by the time I started eating, so it might be fair to say that half my tastebuds were dead by that point. haha

We sat on the patio, and that's where I'd suggest you sit, too. It was so darn pleasant!

There's a big, private lot out back, but there were so many people I had to park in the office building's lot behind. No matter: it didn't seem to make our wait any longer. We had a very attentive waiter who was awesome (we dished it out and he gave it right back, poor man), and never felt like we were left waiting--nor did we feel rushed to leave.  Perfect!

The bathroom was clean and tidy (though I did find the \"holsters\" sign on the ladies' room a bit... jarring?  Slightly offensive?  Yeah... something like that. The men's room stated, \"Pistols,\" btw).

That's all the news that's fit to print. I'll definitely go back. But next time, I'll leave my credit card at home and only bring cash for the trip to Target that will most surely follow."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Had lunch here. Server was not up to par. Portions were big. I had fish tacos. They were unremarkable and \"Texas\" chili had beans. There are no beans in texas chili. Also though it was odd that they brought out popcorn. All in all not a great experience."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Me & Julio's, hard to believe we found it on a whim from listening to a local radio station praising the food and the team at Me & Julio's so we took the time to drive over and see what all the fuss is about - we are glad that we did.  Me & Julio's is located on Fish Hatchery Rd - this was previously the home to Tomas Ballesta's L'Escargot and La Paella.  Me & Julio's is the current reincarnation of this stalwart restaurant locaction, led by Mike Shaul.  Mike took time to visit our table and talk about his personal journey as a restaurateur and introduce us to his diverse Tex-Mex style menu and the charming decor they've created in the space.  Lunch was spectacular - she tried the shrimp enchiladas and I tried the Brisket sandwich. We got started with some deep fried dill pickles - perfect sized pickle chips and freshly made ranch dipping sauce. She loved the enchiladas and proclaimed the refried beans, \"the best ever\".  The brisket was perfectly presented on a ciabatta bun with crisp cole slaw - I also tried the Boracho Beans - Black beans stewed in carrots and onions - delicious flavor.  Of course we tried the 1/2 priced margarita's for the Tuesday special - delicious...oh, and almost forgot one of their signature offerings - a freshly popped bowl of popcorn was immediately brought to our table by our friendly server, Freedom, as soon as we were greeted and seated by our hostess Melinda.  Kudo's to everyone at Me & Julio 's for the friendly service and delicious food and making our first visit fun & inviting - we are looking forward to our next visit - maybe a Wednesday to enjoy the Blue Gill dinner.  Give Me & Julio a try, I know you'll enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"Best place in Madison for margaritas. Great atmosphere. Really good service. Food is always good. Its not going to wow you with the food but it's definitely good. Nice kids menu. Free popcorn while waiting. Good specials. Live music, plenty of TVs to watch sports, and trivia on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Every restaraunt that is new and opening will have some sort of glitch. Maybe the food isn't perfect or the service isn't that great but remember It's only the second week they're open. Food is pretty good from what I've had. Buddy bowl is amazing and the shrimp tacos are a must. Give this place more than one chance."}
{"text":"We stopped by for Mexican food.  Certainly the easiest cuisine to prepare.  They served popcorn instead of chips (available for a price). My $12 chicken enchiladas were bland and very overpriced!  The margaritas were lousy.  They must use the cheapest ingredients available - it tasted like licorice. How can you screw up a margarita? They took it back and removed it from bill.  LOUD music.  Not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I understand some frustration with the service from others, but come on people they just opened. Any new restaurant takes time to work out the kinks. I want to take a step back and really analyze this place for it's long-term potential. 

First off, the space is BEAUTIFUL. Anyone who has been to this place when it was Continental or Veranda will be blown away. The old restaurants here had many different rooms, making the place feel disjointed. Me & Julio has gutted the place completely and now it is open and HUGE! The bar is fantastic and large, bartenders are incredibly attentive. For drinks, the Diablo Paloma and Platinum marg are both well made.

The outdoor area is awesome, has a ton of seating and a great setting, even with Fish Hatchery road in the near distance. 

They give free popcorn to every table, which I think is a nice touch. I have seen some reviews complaining that it's popcorn and not chips and salsa, but this place is as much American as it is Mexican, so that makes sense to me. 

The mix of both American and Mexican dishes is one of my favorite things about the menu, there is something for everyone. 

Service kinks aside, I hope this place makes it, as South Fish Hatch is really in need of a good go-to spot."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical walking into Me & Julio's on a Friday night. All the way out in Fitchburg, this Tex-Mex place doesn't have the best online reviews or a great grandiose presence from the outside. Nevertheless, this place was hopping! The menu is filled with a mixture of Tex (burgers and the like AND Mex (tacos, enchiladas, etc.). Started off with the chips/guac/queso combination, and, while it wasn't amazing (and was pretty expensive at $10), it eased me and my company into the fun atmosphere. My Julio Burger (beef patty topped with an additional chorizo patty, grilled onions and pepper jack) tasted a little more charred than I would have liked, but the Buddy Bowl (rice, chicken, shrimp, grilled vegetables and cheese) was on-point. Friday night had a DJ who played anything from 60's jams to today's stadium country hits. The staff was kind (although it's clear that very few of them LOVE their job), but they were very helpful! If you've got a budget ($20-25/person) and want a chill Friday night alternative to Downtown, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Protip: Tuesday's are trivia night (7:30pm) with half price margaritas (lime and strawberry). I especially like that things usually wrap up at about 10pm. Which is important to me because I need to get home to get my 8 hours of Zzzz.

The food is decent, not a revelation, but definitely adequate and meets expectations. The margaritas, on the other hand, are on point. I highly recommend the blackberry margi.

The space is really open and airy with a giant bar, lots of screens, and nice bathrooms with extras, like lotion, hair spray and lady products. I really appreciate when a business doesn't forget to dress up the bathrooms."}
{"text":"My family is thrilled to have found this gem. We really like the atmosphere and the awesome menu. Our server was very helpful and sweet. The other staff around was attentive to us as well. Genuine good folks. I had puffy tacos for the first time. Chris had a chimichanga. We really enjoyed the food! Yummy! Now if there was going to be a glitch it would have been my 10 year old coming right from the dentist office next door to this place. What would she be able to eat? Well, the menu has most everybody covered from Mexican to great sandwiches, burgers, and other entrees. My 10 year old daughter chose mac n cheese off the kids menu because it had to be soft. Instead of crunchy fruit on her teeth she asked for cottage cheese. They gave her a plentiful heap. She loved it. She was raving that the mac n cheese was the best EVER. The prices were very reasonable and we all loved it. We will be returning! We actually stated this is our new favorite place. It really is a good one."}
{"text":"The outside patio seating is nice and the drinks are pretty good, strong and tastes great. Would definitely go there for happy hour and appetizers. The food is oversized, large portions, maybe to make up for how average it is."}
{"text":"Executive summary: good selection of American amd Mexican food.   Vegetarian and gluten free options are possible but a bit hard to navigate.  Plan on ordering with exclusions, like: salad without chicken, or items without flour tortilla.  Decent size parking lot on site.

Half price classic and strawberry margaritas on Tuesdays and Thursdays, a bowl full of dum dum lollipops at the door, popcorn while you wait...Yes please!

Decent menu and a nice outdoor patio with fire pit table make this a great summer hang out.  Especially on half price margarita nights.  And, fair warning, they are STRONG!  If you think you'll drink two plan to hang around for a while to sober up."}
{"text":"Cool place packed to the rafters. Menu is pretty neat, sufficiently staffed by competent servers.  

All proteins dry. My Diablo chicken was burned hard at the edges and all other meats (burger, two pulled chickens) over cooked, chewy and dry. This seem systematic as it is so very consistent, in multiple visits. 

Drink here or have a salad- they might not burn that."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger medium rare and a glass of wine. Wine was reasonably priced and the burger was over-cooked but otherwise good. Service was decent and food arrived quickly. BUT...

Watched one of the bartenders break a glass in a tub of ice that I think was used to chill beer glasses. He took out his phone and used his flashlight to help pick out a few broken pieces of glass, never replaced the ice, then grabbed his jacket to go outside and (guessing here) have a smoke. 

I paid my bill, let my bartender know what I saw and let him know I would not be back. 

I understand it is a pain to empty and clean an ice tub, and re wash a handful of glasses but the alternative is never acceptable. Awful!"}
{"text":"Highlights/Lowlights

1) good queso
2) nice atmosphere
3) very meh food

Stopped in to Me & Julio on a sunny Friday night in September. We didn't have to wait at all as the space is pretty big, however it was busy! We chose to eat outside on the patio. The atmosphere outside is really nice! They have a big patio with a fire pit, pergolas etc. 

I don't know if I love or hate the concept of Me & Julio. It is essentially Chi Chi's meets Applebee's. The menu is literally split between American food like French fries, burgers and Mexican like tacos and fajitas. Free popcorn is served (yay!). I wouldn't recommend coming here is you are looking for true authentic Mexican. 

We got a bowl of the free popcorn (obviously) and then ordered our drinks. Our server forgot our waters and will all of the salty food we were parched! Our server wasn't overly friendly and we didn't actually see her all that much. It seemed like a different person brought our appetizer and then someone else brought out entrees. 

The food is what ultimately made this a 2 star instead of a 3 star. Quite simply it just wasn't that good. My lemon basil margarita was probably the best part of the meal and I'm pretty sure it still came from a mix. We ordered the queso and guacamole appetizer. It was fine. The queso was decent. The chips were overly salty and the guacamole was worse than what you could buy at a grocery store. We didn't even finish the app, and for anyone who has met me that is saying a lot. My fiancé and I split the chicken fajitas. Again, very sub-par. We both agreed we probably could have made better at home. On top of that, the prices are nearly the same as El Dorado Grill so it's not even that cheap. 

Mexican is my favorite type of cuisine and I'm always open to trying a new spot but I don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"I like the concept and the space. Service is fine. 

The menu could use some clarification. One reviewer said it, and it happened to someone in my party too: some things come with rice OR beans not both, and people used to both, say it on accident and end up getting three bucks added to the bill.

The rice and/or beans have meat in them, can't be had without meat, and it's not clear enough on the menu. That's going to piss some people off. Vegetarians in the Madison area? Nah, it'll never happen. Don't worry, you'll be fine. 

Surprisingly, the bacon/pork belly in your rice didn't help it at all. 

The food is bad.

The steak in my fajitas were all the bad stuff that steak could be: not hot, tough, very bland.

This place serves huge portions and everyone leaves with a box. Some people like that, but it's not as good the next day, and now I've got baggage to carry around. Honestly, I'd rather pay less for an appropriate ampount of food. The last time I was there they got to watch my ass turn around and walk right back out because they refused to sell me a lunch portion for weekend lunch."}
{"text":"My husband & I went here for the 2nd time & the food is soo outstanding, but our waiter Robert was just terrific! He was so attentive didn't miss a beat on anything. So ask for him he's amazing & chicken nachos are to die for yum!!"}
{"text":"Rude and inattentive wait staff, very unprofessional. Food had little flavor and was not cooked properly. Music cut on and off. Myself and my friend got sick immediately after we left."}
{"text":"At least the beer was okay. The \"fish\" tacos had one little breaded fish stick (mostly breading) in a tortilla filled with Coleslaw."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Me and Julios- a first experience.  They were able to make accommodations for a gluten/dairy intolerance and our waitress, Diane, was awesome! The white sangria was refreshing and the other drinks were great. Our kids loved their kids' chicken tacos. The turkey melt was incredible, as well as the enchiladas! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I went they forgot my meal entirely and I ended up just sharing my fiance's meal. I decided to give it another chance since it's in walking distance of my house and has a great outdoor patio. 

This time, I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were delicious. However, within 20 minutes of leaving the restaurant I started vomiting everything that was inside of me. I did a bit of research on food poisoning from shrimp and sure enough, it can hit within 30 minutes of eating. 

I called Me and Julio the following day, left a voicemail with my conact number, letting them know what happened. I haven't heard back from them but I do know I will let that be my last experience here."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. Pretty pricey also. Up charged $5 for asada upgrade on a 13.99 dish. Thought that was a bit much."}
{"text":"A few nights ago we stopped into Me & Julio. We were not disappointed. The inside is warm and inviting. We were seated immediately and our server was friendly and helpful. I liked how the menu was organized into American and Mexican food categories. I had the BLT and it was really tasty. I loved that they offer a side of fruit instead of fries if you want it. The fruit was fresh and yummy. My sandwich had delicious thick cut bacon! The portions are large and so it ended up being two meals for me. The prices are moderate and I feel the food is worth it. We will be going back!!"}
{"text":"Went last week with my mom for the first time. She had been here to other times a couple weeks prior to that. I was very unimpressed with the Mexican food. It didn't taste authentic at all for a restaurant name that makes you think they would have really good Mexican food. We sat outside and had ok service but it wasn't anything spectacular and it wasn't a very busy Monday night either. My mom had two margaritas and couldn't drive home afterwards. So watch out for over pouring! I'm giving it three stars because the food was not spectacular by any means, same for the service, but the decorations set a nice ambience!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like it, but pretty let down. We got the house made chips with French onion dip. The dip was good, really good actually, but the chips were cold. They were definitely \"house made\" and \"fresh\" though likely a day or two ago. I got the chimichanga with ground beef. Bland as can be. Preparation was good, the fry was perfect, but the execution is just so lackluster when it comes to the actual flavor. Partner got buffalo tacos, which were described as \"okay...not amazing\". The burracho beans? Ick! Stay away. The wait staff markets these as \"beer marinated beans, kind of soupy, but good\" so I'm thinking baked beans style dish. No. Try plain black beans with some salsa in what tasted like water. Oookay then. So $45 for two drinks, a small app, and two dishes. Maybe happy hour drinks here in the future, but not much else without some serious changes to the dish. Yet another miss in the Madison area's Mexican cuisine arena. Too bad because we came here with excitement and a desire for a new neighborhood spot. May try again down the line because it wasn't bad, but certainly wasn't great."}
{"text":"not real mexican.  food is ok a bit expensive for what it is.  service is hit miss.  dont have expectations high and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Not sure why I went the second time. Drinks and food was pretty bad. Better places nearby to get food."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night at 7:00pm so we expected to wait was told 30-40 min which was fine. At the bar we had great service ordered Margaritas and then was offered boiled eggs and popcorn as appetizers at no charge. Our buzzer for our table went off 25 minutes after checking in.  Our hostess that showed us to our table was very friendly. Our waitress took our order very quickly and the food  was great!! We could not even eat it all the portions were so large 

Overall great dinner experience and would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local business
Went for lunch on Thursday and the place was about 3/4 full. A Mexican place( I think) and they put popcorn on the table. Had a very overpriced rubbery chicken Caesar salad. Service was spotty but ok .  Very weak tap beer selection, would take a lot to make me go back."}
{"text":"Service: Super nice waitress, very sympathetic of our situation. HOWEVER, the food took 1 hour and 43 minutes to come. She was very apologetic and sweet.

Food: Of 4 people in our family, 3 are vegetarian. We ordered 3 vegetarian meals. Bean burritos with rice, cheese enchiladas etc. When the food came, it ALL of it had meat. Kids bean burritos had rice in it with chunks of bacon and my enchiladas with beans were heavily laced with chorizo. We all went hungry. Thankfully there was a side of fruit salad and some french fries. Oh and we ordered cheese curds to start....and over the course of the 1 hour and 43 minutes we waited....3 ordered of curds came to the table. It was rather comedic. However, My husband had chicken enchiladas and said they were good. 

Atmosphere: LOUD. Really, really loud. Maybe the patio was quieter but it felt like everyone was screaming and we all had sensory overload for sure. There was also a kitchen fire while we were dining...the whole place got smokey to the point we thought for sure alarms were gonna go off.

$$$: Everything was free because they royally screwed up our order (kitchen lost our ticket) and everything had meat...which we had special notes for vegetarian. They also paid for our cocktails. Which was a nice gesture...but we were so hungry, all we wanted was a good meal. NADA.

We won't be going back anytime soon....but if we do, it will be on a full stomach and to try the bloody marys...hopefully they can hold the meat this time."}
{"text":"Service is good but not great. If you're interested in a large group hangout this is idea. A family of four with 2 kids under 10 will probably not get refills in a timely fashion. 

One super fantastic aspect is that they are great with food allergies!  I find restaurants these days are still a bit unsure about how to handle allergies. M&J has a firm handle on what to do and how to ease customer concerns."}
{"text":"I was really confused by this place. Like, really really confused. By the name and atmosphere I felt like it was trying to revive the feelings of the old Tumbleweed restaurants  (something I actually find myself missing occasionally). 

The decoration and feel of the inside is great. It's got that awesome wood fire smell and you immediately walk in/start at the bar, which is huge and clearly well stocked. They have Angry Orchard on tap, which is a **huge** selling point for me. 

We were greeted and sat pretty much immediately which I always appreciate. The menu is where the confusion started setting in. It's a cross between American and Mexican. You'd expect it to be Tex-Mex, and it's not. It's a large burger menu with some exceptionally random Mexican dishes tossed in. Our server stopped by, and dropped of a bowl of popcorn. No, really, popcorn. I think that's an official first. The only place I've ever been given popcorn was a dive bar, and not even a good dive bar. (3 cheers for good dive bars) The popcorn had a nice flavor, but had the misfortune of being stale. 

I asked our waitress, who was awesome, what she recommended. She said their burgers were awesome, so I figured I'd give that a go. My husband opted for a burrito. I ordered the patty melt, because if you're going to try a burger for the meat, always start as simple and pure as possible. You can get fancy on the next visit. The burger was ok. It wasn't anything super special. That's not to say it was bad, but it wasn't anything I'd go out of my way to try and order again or would return to a place based off that alone. It had no seasoning, but once I added some salt and pepper it was just fine. I will say that their sweet potato fries are some of the best I've had, which is awesome. I can't speak to my husband's burrito, because I didn't eat it. I will say that he's pretty vocal about things he ends up really liking or things he really doesn't like. He was pretty quiet and doesn't even really remember anything about eating it, which should say something. I will say that the rice he got as a side was fried rice. It had egg in it. We were confused, and heard confusion  (and anger) from the table behind us for the same reason. 

So all in all, the food was ok, the atmosphere  was good, and the service good. I feel like 3 stars is fairly apt, because it wasn't special or memorable, outside of my Angry Orchard and fries."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a cool vibe, the food was fantastic and the drinks were great!! They serve popcorn as your free appetizer. I had the bang bang shrimp tacos that had great flavor. The hubs had fajita and he ran out of onions before the meat....which never happens. The bacon vodka bloody mary was the best ever!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. A great mix of Mexican food and American food. Their margaritas are delicious and they have great happy hour specials. Free popcorn to the table. Cheese curds are amazing and the enchiladas verdes are my favorite entree there. I probably go here once a month - it is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've visited on three separate occasions and feel as though both the food and service are consistently just okay. Not great, not terrible."}
{"text":"I came here for a Plant night event.  Before the planting started, a few co workers and I got a bite to eat and a drink(s).  I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were very good.  It was a platter of three tacos with rice and beans.  I had the basil margarita and a strawberry margarita.  If you get there before six pm, you can enjoy happy hour.

The place was hopping!  It is a big space but it fills up fast.  I had a good time so I definitely want to check it out again."}
{"text":"Not going to give a lengthy review. This place doesn't really deserve it, feels like a Mexican apple bees. If that's your thing you found the place. HUGE menu, HUGE restaurant. They get you in, get your served and get you out. However the menu didn't really have anything unique, and the food was run of the mill. This is the generic Mexican restaurant, don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"I've been to Me & Julio three times. It's a decent spot for appetizers and drinks but nothing to write home about. The beef tacos were worse than Taco Bell, the chicken tacos were decent, and the bang bang shrimp tacos were good. The prices are high considering the small portions, and they give you popcorn instead of chips and salsa. The first time I went they forgot my order of Al Pastor tacos, but at least the manager comped me a margarita. I'm disappointed because I wanted to like this place. I never thought I'd say this, but go to Laredo's instead for Tex Mex if you have to stay in the Fitchburg area."}
{"text":"We were really hoping this place would be great.   

We waited about 90 minutes for our food, as did a few other tables.  Salsa was respectable, but the chips were pretty plain.  After much anticipation, my burger came out and tasted funny.  Upon closer examination the bun had been burned.  Fries were ok, but salty.  Wife's Mexican was ok, but bland.  

Atmosphere was nice, and our server was great (and apologetic) Meal was comped for our wait.  

Might give it another try later this summer, when the kitchen has some time to sort things out.  

Great outdoor seating area.   Two stars for food and five for service."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! They have the best nachos I have ever had! I thought the prices were very reasonable for the big portions you get. The margaritas do have a kick to them but I like a strong drink."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming menu, obviously Sysco inspired and not locally focused. Atmosphere is too open, too bright and loud. Feels like a cross between a casino, a 90's grill your own steak joint, a cafeteria and a family restaurant. TERRIBLE margaritas that taste JUST like Jose Cuervo pre-mixed from the bottle. Just bad. Was really excited for this place too...outdoor seating looks cool, but not enough to draw me back to spend $100 on a mediocre meal and terrible drinks."}
{"text":"5 stars for the taco salad!!! Mmmmm. Yum. However, the other items I have tried (puffy tacos, burrito) were not very good. The service is hit or miss. They never seem to be busy, so I would think the service would be top notch. I cannot stand when the server doesn't clear empty (stacked!) plates. If they have a free hand, they should always take the plates. Pre bussing. It's easy and appreciated. The prices are a little high, but again, get the taco salad. It comes in a huge taco shell. Great presentation and fresh flavors. I always get it with salsa instead of queso. My boyfriend had the fish fry (baked cod) and said it was good. If you're looking for gluten free, get the chicken over the beef. The beef is mixed with enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food wasn't great. I went there expecting a Mexican restaurant, but it was hardly Mexican food. If you're looking for Tex Mex this is the place to go, but not Mexican."}
{"text":"Stopped in to listen to the live band because I liked the smooth jazzy/blues sounds. (Nine Thirty Standard) decided to get a bite to eat and was blown away by the flavor in the food! Both the Bang Bang Shrimp and Tacos Pastor were delightful well flavored items! Instead of receiving free chips and salsa, here you get popcorn! Side dishes of black beans in a very slightly sauce and Spanish rice were also tasty. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Super busy place but got a table and they were very accommodating for me being a celiac. A bit disjointed in service (they all tried but were slammed we ended up having 4 different servers) and we realized last minute part of our meal was forgotten. Some kinks to work out but pretty good overall. I definitely appreciated how they went out of their way to accommodate my food allergy."}
{"text":"Update:

I've downgraded this from a 4 to a 2 after trying this place twice. I won't be coming back.

This weekend I saw the sign outside saying they served breakfast and got excited. Mexican breakfast is my favorite, and I had dreams of breakfast tacos and burritos. We didn't love our last experience for dinner but we figured we'd give it a second chance hoping it had improved since then, and it didn't look busy.

The first sign of trouble came when our waitress was slow to take our coffee and orange juice order. She then disappeared for 10-15 minutes while another waitress was in and out five times. Finally, we had to ask that waitress what was going on. A guy sitting next to us also had to ask where she was. We never got a \"sorry\" or anything from our waitress, and everyone else was doing her job (maybe she was new? If so, maybe she could have used some help)

Unfortunately, they don't serve breakfast tacos. No big deal I told myself, I'll try the burrito instead (but subtract some awesomeness points in my book). I ordered my burrito vegetarian.

The food finally came and I was completely underwhelmed. The burrito had no flavor, save some \"spice\" in the sauce they poured on top (maybe because I got it without chorizo, but I'm not sure chorizo would have saved this). My \"vegetarian\" burrito had chunks of sausage in it, which isn't a big deal to me but knowing how serious some food allergies are, that's a major red flag that they can't keep food separate. The guacamole was kind of disgusting, and the hash browns with cheese on top felt completely out of place. I didn't finish my meal, which is rare for me.

I've summed up why this place is such a let down: none of the details match the exterior or promise of this place. The menus look *terrible*, like some kid used microsoft word, scaled up the images, and printed them on an inkjet printer at home. As a business owner myself, I would *never* let that fly, it drives me absolutely bonkers! Things like the glasses they serve drinks in make the place feel cheap. The slow service is just unacceptable if you want to be taken seriously.

The thought that millions were poured into rehabbing this building and starting a business, only for every single detail to be missed, is unfathomable to me. I would *never* let this fly at my own business, the second I saw those menus going out to customers I would flip my chair.

I also can tell why so many people are very critical of this place: we expect so much better, and we've been trained to expect so much better. We can go downtown and get some of the best food served by the smartest restaurateurs in the entire state/region/country. Lilianas proved us suburbanites can get good, non-chain food in our backyard. We want flavor and authenticity, and we want to be served by people that really care. We're happy to pay more but it has to deliver.

This place doesn't, not in any way except the *exterior* building design.


Old review:

I live nearby and am really excited about this place and I hope they'll keep improving post-opening.

First of all, the food was pretty decent. My wife had the Shrimp tacos (bang bang?) which I tried and were very good. I had the enchiladas which were also decent. I liked hers more than mine. I also tried a margarita which was average. A bit too sweet and a bit weak (and I wasn't crazy about the glass). I do agree it's overpriced dish-for-dish.

Service was good even though it was busy, no complaints there.

I'm not much of a tex-mex fan, but I felt like it was more Tex than Mex, with only a hint of authenticity. Here's hoping they focus on the Mexican side of the menu going forward and expand it with more interesting and authentic options.

At the end of the day, Fitchburg needs more and better restaurants, and most aren't on par with downtown/willy st quality. I hope this one can become more than just a cliche suburban tex mex restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and Julio have a really complicated relationship. I feel as though it's slightly abusive, but I keep going back. Truthfully, if it wasn't for Tuesday trivia nights and half off margaritas, I would never go. God, I wish I could quit you! If you have to eat here, go for the nachos (a medium can feed two easily)."}
{"text":"I desperately want to like this restaurant. I held off on writing a review because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and really give them a fair chance since they're new. I tried the restaurant 3 times before writing this review. I truly hope they continue to work on the menu and make improvements. We need more good quality restaurants in Fitchburg, and I hope they can turn things around to meet this need.

The owners did an incredible job renovating/rebuilding this place. The inside of the restaurant is really beautiful and spacious. The outdoor patio seems like a great spot to hangout. I can see this being a good place to come for happy hour, but I would not recommend the food.

On our first visit, we tried the Mexican side of the menu. Our group tried a variety of dishes. It was some of the worst Mexican I've ever had.  There was no depth to the favors, and everything tasted kind of sweet. Even the side of refried beans tasted sweet like they added sugar to it or something...I couldn't bring myself to eat the beans because it was such a weird unexpected sweet flavor for refried beans. I would not order from the Mexican side of the menu again.

On our second visit, we tried the American side of the menu. The American side was a lot better. They make decent burgers and sandwiches. Nothing stands out as great. They do a decent job with bar food.

On our third visit, we stuck to the American side of the menu and the burgers/sandwiches were okay. Unfortunately, my dad opted to try the drunk and dirty steak. He said it was the worst steak he has ever had...so bad he suggested it should be taken off the menu. The flavor was terrible, the steak was very tough and chewy, the cut of the meat seemed poor quality. He couldn't bring himself to eat more than a few bites...and I've never seen my dad not finish everything on his plate. The manager was very pleasant and did not charge us for the inedible steak.

Overall, the food is mediocre at best...inedible at its worst.  My impression of the food is that there are too many items on the menu, and they did not do enough with menu development and recipe testing up front to ensure good food. It seems like they are testing out the menu items on customers to see what works and what doesn't rather than testing things out ahead of time. They would be better off having a smaller menu and taking the time to perfect a smaller number of specialty dishes. Since there is obviously work to be done in regards to the menu, it seems like they should be proactive about seeking honest feedback from customers, so they can make improvements or maybe hire some focus groups to provide feedback on recipe development.

As far as the service goes, it has been okay...not super attentive, but not terrible. One waitress got my mom's drink order wrong and then tried to convince her that the drink she brought my mom was better anyway...instead of bringing her what she ordered. That was off-putting. The manager has been pleasant and helpful.

I don't think I'll be back..."}
{"text":"We tried two items recommend by the wait staff. The chicken enchiladas were the best thing we ordered. Nice balance of flavors with shredded chicken. Our other entree was the bang bang shrimp taco. It was marinated shrimp, some carrots, cilantro. It was fresh but felt we could put together something similar easily at home. The tortilla they used was particularly good. We were split on if the Mexican rice with scrambled egg was good or weird. The refried beans tasted more like grilled peppers than beans. Free popcorn on the table was a nice treat but I'd prefer chips and salsa in a Tex Mex restaurant. Ambiance of the place is nice. Lots of big screens with sports. It was rainy so we didn't get to use the large patio but it would be a good place to hang out. I'd give a higher rating if the food was better. Overall if was a little below average in comparison with other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"A new local Mexican / American restaurant that does neither very well.  
I had the Taco salad which was a huge portion, but lacked pizazz. Lot of lettuce, meat, queso cheese sauce (that tasted like it came from a can) and some guacamole (that also looked like it was store bought.) and sour cream. That's it, I think it could have used some beans or Mexican rice to some more texture to it. It was too simple."}
