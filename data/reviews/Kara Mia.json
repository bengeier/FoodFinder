{"text":"My most favourite Italian restuarant in the Vaughan area - and this area is full of Italian restaurant.  This is definitely not a typical Italian though - they have eastern twists in various dishes - which make it different in a great way.  The dishes are simply more flavourful.  I love the various pasta sauces and seasoning that use saffron.  The chicken pastas, steak pastas and seafood pastas are all awesome.  I am not a big steak person and have also heard that their steaks are not their strong point.  The two poutines are really great as well - which again also are different from regular poutines as they have hints of eastern flavours.  Awesome restaurant.  If you feel like having Italian, and want to try something different, this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have been disappointed the last handful of visits.

Most recent visit, my group and I waited for an hour before the first meal was delivered. From there it took another 20 minutes before we all got our food. 

I ordered the peppercorn steak. I ordered it medium well, they gave it to me well done. It was chewy, hard and not flavourful at all.  The vegetable side was a big gloppy mess of green and red peppers - the \"sauce\" they cooked it in tasted like a glue of corn starch and water. There were three small half pieces of roasted potatoes. For 22 bucks I expect a lot more. 

Our waitress was nice - felt bad for her because it's not her fault that the kitchen is so slow, but she had to hear about it from the customers in the dining room."}
{"text":"Bad service. Mediocre food. We waited almost an hour to get our order taken. Then almost 2 hours for our food to come out. What a shame this restaurant used to be my favorite back at their Vaughan location"}
{"text":"perfect food & service
I definitely recommend this restaurant for friends.
my kids like steak and pasta. Italian cuisine with a touch of chif is definitely delicious"}
{"text":"Tried a couple of things on the menu, nothing was that impressing with the exception of the saffron poutine. The best poutine ever! Definitely recommend. Customer service is good other than the fact that they take very long to serve you and bring you your bill."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. It's a guessing game right from when you walk in. No host to seat you or a sign stating to seat yourself. Once seated we were handed the menu. 20 minutes go by and no one comes by to check up to see if we are ready to order. I noticed people walking up to the counter and that's when we realized that it was more of a quick serve style. Again if the host would've told us that when he seated us it would've saved us the guessing pain. While placing the order, some of the menu items were sold out ie ribs and no drink options from their mocktail menu. Finally our order is in and our appi comes out in 15-20mts. Loved the saffaron poutine we ordered! Then it was the waiting game again!! 40 minutes pass by and our main course is no where to be seen. No update from the kitchen as to how long it would be. No apology or check up by the staff. After 50 minute wait I finally got the servers attention. He goes in to check on our ticket and comes out with our meal. The only reason I'm goving this place a 2 star is because of their food. Their dood is good but their service is HORRIBLE!! Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday night and I had the Penne Picante Rosa. Everyone else with me enjoyed their meals consisting of steak and other pastas. 

Definately will go here again next time I visit!"}
{"text":"I don't think I'm going to visit this place again. Made the mistake of going on a Saturday evening during Ramadan. Firstly they had a limited Ramadan menu which is okay. But when I'm going to a restaurant while fasting I expect my food to come relatively promptly. Gave our order at 8:45 and she told us who ever orders will get their food first - ok. We didn't get our food until 9:50.... Totally unacceptable. It wasn't even packed. Food was good but by the time it came out we were just angry. 

Then on the menu it said that all pastas come with bread and salad. Ours came so late and then it came with no sides. When we asked the waitress said it's only if you get a smaller portion of pasta - it said that no where on the menu. She brought some for us after we complained about it. The management of this place sucks and they need to get their act together because I actually enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Today, I went to this restaurant and it is pure deliciousness! :-)  The fettucine kara mia was delish and their cheese cakes are tremendous! I must go back there one day and I recommend that you go there as well if you haven't already! The waiter was a very nice guy who provided prompt and efficient service. What a good waiter! The other dishes were tasty and the burgers were juicy."}
{"text":"This place has really great food and excellent service. They have continuously met my expectations.
I mostly order the BBQ ribs and would really recommend it! They fall right off the bone and have this nice slight acitidy to them. 

So far my favourite place for halal BBQ ribs. I love them so much I seldom order anything else. The price is very reasonable too -  I paid $25 for a rack!"}
{"text":"I guess, being the first to review, what I write will influence anyone looking this place up! If you're reading this then Karamia is a place to try and will not regret. As for how much you like the food, you be the judge!

The location is new, clean, bright and pretty. It was not crowded nor noisy. They have booths and plenty more space than their old location.

The waiter was very friendly and smiley, however, they lost half a star in this category. She didn't check up frequently enough to refill our waters or ask if we needed anything. We found ourselves looking for her on a few occasions (when my friend couldn't take the spice from her plate and needed water!!). I can't complain too much here because it wasn't THAT bad.

Their service was very quick. We had our plates in about 15 minutes, but like I said it wasn't busy. Our plates were hot and delicious.

I had the peppercorn chicken plate and upgraded to the saffron poutine. I was hesitant but my friends told me to try it and I'm glad I did. It was different...creamy and savory and the flavor was not overbearing in any way. The chicken was very tender and flavourful and the salad and dressing were good. My friend had a saffron sauce pasta plate with steak and she said it was kind of dry but otherwise delicious. 

Bottom line if you're looking for a good new halal 'italian' place to try out, definitely come here, eat and be merry :)"}
{"text":"The pasta dishes we had were actually quite good, but the service was extremely slow (although to be fair they were quite busy). The bruschetta was a bit weird - it came with what seemed to be ketchup and hot sauce. The waitress was friendly and seemed busy gossiping with other staff and people in the restaurant. I personally probably would not go back. The prices were quite reasonable though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite halal steak places, just would like the chef to go back to the original recipes he did when the restaurant started and make the food less spicy"}
{"text":"Love the taste of the Pasta! 
Thank you Lynn for your kind service.
God bless you & your business"}
{"text":"~I would this place a 4 but the service was extremely slow~

I took my whole family to check out Kara Mia and Desi Eh! both combined into one restaurant. One brand servers Italian cuisine and the other Pakistani Punjabi cuisine. So we got a spot and you have to order at the cashier and the food comes to your table. The cashier and server although high school kids were very friendly and happy but the kitchen staff was quite slow in sending the food out. 

We ordered a bunch of dishes:

Fettuccine Alfredo - Fettuccine in a rich creamy garlic and parmesan sauce. This was not bad and we went with the chicken option, so they had breast meat.

Peppercorn Steak - Grilled, tender AAA Striploin steak topped with peppercorn sauce wasn't the best and I would get a juicy stack some where else.

Spicy BBQ Pizza  - Grilled BBQ chicken, red pepper, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, onion and mozzarella cheese was quite surprising good and nicely done.

Meat Lovers - Grilled AAA Striploin steak, grilled chicken breast, jalapeno peppers and mozzarella cheese was my favourite one of them all and I really enjoyed it.

Meat Lasagne - Ground beef, spinach, ricotta and mozzarella cheese,served with Caesar salad was just average. 

Chicken Dhaba Karahi - Succulent meat from the whole chicken cooked with onion, garlic, tomatoes, green chillies and dhaba spices, finished with fresh ginger and green coriander. Now this was awesomeness at its peak and we really enjoyed this dish. We ate this with naan, their naan were extremely good.

For dessert we when with Khoya Kheer and Malaee Kulfi both were average.

Over all foodwise it was a good experience but the service was extremely slow.

For my Muslim Bothers and Sisters - they serve halal meat at this location."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to Kara Mia, both my husband and I had had separate bad experiences, but we decided to give the place another shot. Big mistake!

First off our soup was cold. Forgivable I suppose. The appetizer consisting of breaded shrimp was presented in such a pathetic way on a bed of romaine lettuce, that was starting to go bad. There was no accompanying sauce or any real flavour to this dish. When our steaks arrived they looked pathetic. The sauce on both had congealed and my husband's accompanying sauce tasted as he put it like \"white sauce mixed with cheese whiz.\" The vegetable medley was laughable, two large grated chunks of carrot and broccoli just sitting there with roast potatoes. The only hot element of the meal was my husband's potatoes that had to be asked for as they didn't come on his dish and had been forgotten in the fryer therefore slightly burnt! Good job chef. Whoever the head chef was should know that sauce should be ladled right before being sent out not just left to sit there and congeal. My steak was so COLD! I am really frustrated that we paid $75 for this garbage. I know it sounds harsh but looking back I'm pretty ticked off. The service is not that great, I literally had to knock on my table oh so subtly to get some attention and actually be served in the first place."}
{"text":"This place is an Italian HALAL restaurant. That should be filed as an oxymoron. You wouldn't believe they served Italian because it felt more like I walked into a Saudi restaurant. It was a little uncomfortable for a kafir, Western girl like me. 

The cons:
1. No booze. I guess if you serve halal, you wouldn't have alcohol. 

2. Shitty service. We had a party of about 15-20 and all the plates came out at different times. By the time the last person got their food, the first person to be served was already finished with dinner. Not okay. 

3. Creepy birthday music tape that played every 17-20 minutes. 

4. Food poisoning. I got sick right after I finished eating and it ruined the rest of my night. 

I guess if you're ever in the mood for halal Italian food...slaughter the animal at home in the name of God and cook your own chicken Alfredo."}
{"text":"Great pasta and amazing sauces!! You can't go wrong with either peppercorn or saffron sauce. Both mouth watering"}
{"text":"This is a Halal Italian and steak restaurant. The food has a touch or hint of Oriental/Indian spices. Can get busy. Sometimes, may need to reserve a table prior to showing up.

Food: 
- Pastas/Spaghetti: Mostly Italian basic cuisine here like pastas and such. Not the fancy Italian dishes. 
- Steaks: I tried their steak (both chicken and beef). Beef was nice and juicy but the chicken was extremely dry. Steak was nothing extraordinary but when it comes to steak, you know honestly, I would rather go to a real steak place. 
- Burgers: OK. Like those feel-like-home-made patties. But however, the second trip I had and wanted to have a burger, I was disappointed, took them 45 min for my burger and it was terrible, felt like as if they warmed up a left over.

Service: 
- Great, however. 
- Clean location, bathroom included."}
{"text":"Kara Mia is one of the most successful Halal restaurants I have ever experienced. Without a doubt its success has been built on providing quality Italian food w/ a chic modern twist. The amount of Halal Italian restaurants in and around the GTA is scarce if any, so the fact that a Halal Italian restaurant opened up is huge, the fact that the food rivals most Italian restos is even huger.  

Executive Chef Abderrahman Khallouk (Abdul) left England for Morocco to acquire his certification. He then traveled France, Spain, Italy, and Switzerland to name a few experiencing all the different cultures and cuisines. Truth be told his cooking tastes as though it's from abroad, the quality of cuisine at Kara Mia is truly deliciously foreign. 

All the apps are delicious such as the crevette blanc (black tiger shrimp in tomato-cream sauce) and calamari fritti (deep fried calamari w/ dill dip). The pasta is typically al dente accompanied by light tasty sauces. Without a doubt my favourite pasta dish there is the house special, Fettuccine Kara Mia. The pasta is served w/ grilled chicken sautéed w/ sun dried tomatoes and spinach, the sauce is a light cream sauce and the dish is topped w/ fresh feta, then buddy bakes it for a few minutes...ayah.

The Entrées section of the menu consists of mostly meat dishes and stir-fry's. I have tried the chicken parmesan, and although it's not the best I've had, it's pretty damn good. The steaks are well seasoned and prepared to near perfection. Although I typically only order steaks included in the daily specials, the peppercorn steak is a favourite among my friends. The next entrée I must try is the Bisteca Fungui, a AAA steak finished w/ mushroom gorgonzola saffron cream sauce, topped w/ black tiger shrimps or chicken breast served on a bed of vegetables....!

The restaurant itself is smaller than larger. Service is great unless they are absolutely packed. Overall I bestow upon Kara Mia a solid 4.5/5 and recommend it to anyone and everyone. There is also a newly opened location in Mississauga that I'm sure is just as good as the Vaughan location. Bon appetito!"}
{"text":"Kara Mia is a fantastic halal Italian food joint! Love the food at this location specifically. The saffron utine and Rose pasta are my faves! Great place!"}
{"text":"Always a classic go to for a nice dinner, their service is usually good but the only thing is their price is a bit high, I've had almost everything on their menu except anything with Saffron. Their poutine is nice and cheesey, their steaks are cooked exactly how you want and all the sauces (peppercorn/bbq) are made in-house, fries aren't that good though. I have been coming here for years and their pasta is a bit richer than your normal Italian joint but I like that. Their penne picante rose, fettuccine kara mia, cajun steak pasta and bbq steak are among my favourites. Their presentation and taste is always consistent.

*If your getting a pasta ask for baked cheese for an extra $, it takes the pasta to a whole new level"}
{"text":"The worst experience in my life. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant at any cost. We had to wait in the line up just to get the menu. Then we had to wait in another line up to make the order. The food came after 50 mins. Rice were burned and their so called Italian food items were a complete joke!"}
{"text":"FOOD: 3/5 - Not entirely sure why other reviewers said their steaks were great. They really weren't that great of a quality meat and you could really tell the difference by its texture. They were quite tough and chewy, almost like chewing on bubble gum. However, I did enjoyed their sauce, without the sauce, I'd find it very hard to consume. I tried the peppercorn steak in rare and the steak with spinach, tomato and saffron sauce in medium rare. Although, the steaks were cooked to our desire doneness but the rare peppercorn steak was actually chewier than the saffron steak and I couldn't finish it. I upgraded the fries to the Saffron poutine (for $3.99 more) and I loved it. The sauce and melted cheese were a great combo, I actually like it better than gravy since gravy tends to be salty. 

With their dinner special, the entree comes with an appetizer, soup or cheesecake and a piece of Italian sausage for $27.99. Value-wise, it's great since the portion is large and filling. Quality-wise, you really get what you paid for. If you really want a quality steak, I'd recommend to go elsewhere. There's a reason why a piece of steak with so many sides cost less than $30. 

SERVICE: 4/5 - Very friendly, attentive, accommodating and cheerful. Although, our server forgot to mention to us there was a dinner special in the beginning, but he offered to make the adjustment for us later on after he told us about it. 

ENVIRONMENT: 3.5/5 - Contemporary family-style type setting with booths for smaller parties and tables for larger group. Great place for conversation. We went on a Friday and saw groups of people carrying their worships in the corner of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant featured on Breaking Bread. After watching this i was curious.  So after work i made the effort to go and get food. Must say the staff was friendly. As for the food it was very tasty. The only negative thing i have to say the portion's could have been better."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday. We were very pleased!. Service, food, and prices were excellent. The cook is amazing, food had flavour, qulity and good portions.  We will definately be back. I felt bad becauae our group was soo loud and still the server was nothing but kind and professional!"}
{"text":"The quality has gone down since it first opened. The penne picanta is the only thing on the menu that I enjoyed"}
{"text":"This is the only halal Italian restaurant I know of so I knew I had to give it a try. I came here on a Friday evening with a friend after work and it took sometime to get seated as the place was quite busy. The decor and atmosphere of the place was nice and it was very clean.

I ordered a hot spot burger with saffron poutine and my friend got the penne picante rose (hope I typed that right) with Italian sausage. Initially I wasn't sure what the saffron poutine would entail but it was one of the best decisions I made, that poutine was amazing I really loved the cheesiness and crispness of the Fries. The burger itself was cooked to perfection and all of the toppings blended really well together. I will definitely be going back for more as there really wasn't any downside to this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Their Groupon deal was very enticing; for $33, we got food of a $60 value! I came here with my family for the first time this past week and it was delightful!

We started our dinner with the saffron poutine which other Yelpers have recommended. It was served hot with nice gooey melted cheese! It is hard to describe what saffron tastes like but there was something subtle yet unique about the dish!

My brother had the special of the night which was steak and chicken in a peppercorn sauce, pasta in rose sauce and a delicious cream (of mushroom?) soup. It was a lot of food for $27 and the steak was cooked perfectly - a nice medium rare which he asked for! My mom ordered the penne in saffron sauce and I ordered the saffron burger ($11)! My mom enjoyed her meal, the pasta was al dente and the sauce was flavorful and rich. My burger was okay, the patty was juicy, however the bun was a little dry and plain. 

The prices are comparable to Kelsey and Boston Pizza nearby but the food is way better in my opinion so give this place a try and definitely get the saffron poutine!"}
{"text":"What a change in this place from the last time I was here during Ramazan time.  They were full!! no surprise there.  Food is always amazing, but service was slow.  Unlike today, they went out of their way to get my son his spaghetti.  I love the food, but today I noticed they had a little more variety than last year.  They should get more staff too, but in all in good time :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"I hear this Kara moved from the Vaughn location.  I could be wrong?!? I like the fact they are now in some what of a bigger place, ambiance is still the same, decent decor, contemporary classic vibe.  This place would be good to take a date on, without spending more than $50.  some dishes are up there, but pasta dishes are okay price.  Quantity and flavor is still the same.  Italian style but Halal.  This place attracts a lot of young crowd, so it gets noisy.  

The steak isn't thick, like some of the steak houses.  But it's cooked to your liking.  I like the pasta dishes, but I find them too heavy for my appetite.  Salmon is tasty and love fresh sautéed veggies.  

It's not a cheap place to dine.  A family of 12 can cost about $200-$250"}
{"text":"Wayyy way over priced!!! But Great food!! whatever the quantity of the food, it is enough to fill you up. The steaks was enjoyed by everyone, and fulfilling for the men.  Thanks to them for sharing a bit or two ;) with a party of 6 kids and 8 adults, where 3 men ordered the steak, it cost about $350.  Sometimes with the crowd the service is slow. but lately I think with these prices it's quite down a little."}
{"text":"The food taste desi.. I think they put kasuri methi in the pasta.. the Alfredo chicken had sauce that Definitely came from a jar from the grocery store..
Service was not good..  dinner took Very long to come to the table.. 
It was very unhygienic, servers hands were touching the dishes."}
{"text":"Saffron Poutine was amazing!! my absolute favorite - all the pasta's are amazing especially fettuncine Karamia!"}
{"text":"The Peppercorn steak was amazing.  Very Polite staff and great atmosphere.  We enjoyed the Saffron Poutine which was one of the best we have had.  Fries were crispy with hot saffron sauce.  My friends had the rosemary chicken which was cooked perfectly and the sauce was great.  I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, serves halal food, the service is fast and friendly, and the ambience is pretty nice! We came on a Saturday for a late lunch and, surprisingly, it was empty but don't let that deter you from trying this place out - based on other reviews, this place can get pretty busy. 

Since we all weren't that hungry, as a group of three, we got the peppercorn steak special - striploin steak  (medium well) with peppercorn sauce, mashed potatoes, salad, a sausage, and a pecan caramel cheesecake slice - for $27.99.  The steak was so good - I don't know what's exactly in the peppercorn sauce but it was delicious and the mashed potatoes and salad were nicely paired with it. The sausage was a bit random of an add-on for me but it was good too - not as good as the steak but still something to help fill us up. The cheesecake slice was good to end the meal but not the best I've had for cheesecake. I'd say the price you pay for all this is worth it. 

Since we were three, we decided one steak special wouldn't be enough for us so we ordered a saffron poutine to eat on the side ($7.99 but a larger size exists for $11.99). This dish was amaaazing - fries in a saffron sauce with mozzarella cheese. If you come here and had to order one thing - this would be it.  I'd come back (and am planning on doing so) JUST for the poutine.  Saffron isn't a common ingredient in dishes and I am not 100% sure how to describe it - sort of bittersweet... (obviously in a good way) you'll just have to experience it yourself. All three of us loved it. No questions. 

Kara Mia is a great restaurant in the area - great service, nice environment, a good variety of options, and yummy yummy food - it's a recommend from me!"}
{"text":"Went here after many years. Looks like they're under new management. Staff seems very disorganized. Angry customers were seen. People waiting a very long time for their food. Went to place an order and they told me 45 minutes before the food will come out. We walked out."}
{"text":"the place is a hit or miss . the chicken parmesan is my go to dish but sometimes the chicken is overcooked, sometimes not enough sauce, sometimes to lemony. if I am feeling lucky then I go visit this place. I am usually not lucky though"}
{"text":"HALAL!!
Super efficient  service! Place was pretty packed and very loud when we got there. Loved the fact that the food came super quick! Pasta was good. Nothing over the top extraordinary. If you're craving pasta, this is the place to go! 
Price: average 13-20
We had the Alfredo kara Mia and saffron sauce penned."}
{"text":"Overall, food is pretty good. Tried the steak. Was surprised to have marinara sauce on it though, but again this is an Italian restaurant.
Good service. Decor and spacing not so good."}
{"text":"Went there last evening.  We had been to the one in Mississauga and it was terrible.  Since we were in neighbourhood, thought we would give Markham location a try.  

The saffron poutine was absolutely delicious.  When we got our main meals however, it was really disappointing.  My pasta al carne had very little flavour and sauce was very runny.  Probably could have used a bit of thickener.  My husband's pasta dish was devoid of flavour and watery.  

The service started out really good, then went really bad.  I was used to the poor service at Mississauga location, but was hoping this location would be better.


Perhaps it was the dishes we chose I don't know.  Since location is far from where we live, probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is so closed!! There is a Chinese restaurant now in that unit (Unit 39). Update your address, I wasted 30 mins looking for this place."}
{"text":"Totally Not Worth it !!

On several Halal Websites, we had heard great reviews of this place, however we personally had a just ok experience here. 

The space and ambience is good enough and good for groups as well. It includes 2 places Desi Eh and Kara Mia both in one. 

The server was good, directed to our table and handed us the menus. However order has to be given at cashier, it's not taken at your table. Just an FYI, this place is expensive, the rates are higher in comparison to many other similar places. 

So we ordered Multani Chicken Karahi, Naans, Bruschetta with Cheese Bread for Appetizer and Penne De La Casa Chicken Breast! We were 4 adults and 1child. 

Now the worst part is the wait, the food took almost 45-50mins to come, it was good we had company or else we would've been frustrated. We asked the server about the delay and he said they cook one table at a time...

Now the Appetizer is good, but nothing wow about it or much special about, taste wise it was ok as well. 
I was looking forward to the Chicken Karahi, but was disappointed, it's the Multani Karahi, but honestly others are better than this. 
The Pene De La Casa Chicken was delicious, something different to try!

To summarize you will really not feel you got your money's worth ! The food surely doesn't suffice your appetite and the price doesn't provide value to the food !"}
{"text":"I went to Kara Mia on a saturday with my family, it wasnt as crowded as we thought it should be for a sat night, either way we reached at 8:20 didnt get our food till 9:45 and even after telling them several times didnt get water till 9:30. They also didnt have a bunch of dishes, they didnt give us the food we ordered either. My uncle called the manager to speak to him who happens to be the owner. Instead of apologizing he said we should be happy he took the time out to come see us. This isnt the first time we have been to Kara Mia but certainly our last for this location. I gave it 2 stars only because their food is halal and pretty good. But not enough to have me wait hours for my food."}
{"text":"Other websites rated this place highly so I went. Food was very plain. Restaurant was nearly empty at dinner time. 

No wine available as restaurant is actually a halal Italian restaurant. 

\"Italian\" food without wine? That's a stretch."}
{"text":"After hearing a few good things and many bad things about this place, a group of us thought we'd give it a try anyway..

Worst food experience ever!

We specifically ordered early to ensure we got our food before Iftar time... instead it took them two hours to get our  food. (everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be getting their food including people who arrived after us)

Horrible customer service (place seats about 50, but has ONE waiter running around). Any other restaurant would have apologized or offered a discount or something, but even when we asked to speak to the manager, we were told he was busy cooking and to just order an appetizer until our food came.. 

Pasta was nothing special...sauce was too thick and bland, for the price we were paying we were expecting much more. 

Took forever to get our bills, we were pretty much the last table out of the restaurant, they didnt even have change for cash.

Complete waste of time."}
{"text":"The food is good but the slow and bad service make for a poor dining experience. They take 10 minutes to ask for a drinks order and 20 for apps. I've given it enough chances. They need to get their act together."}
{"text":"First time of my life i find a Halal italian restaurant ! Steak and italian sausage on one plate very yummy !! Even tho Its not the most fancy looking restaurant but definately worth a stop with friends and family, the restaurant is clean the only downside is :  its a 2 for 1 restaurants there is italian and pakistani cuisine under one roof so u can imagine the blend of smell in the air :s .. They only accept cash or debit .. In 2016 especially on food where margins of profit are pretty high they should accept credit cards ! For the food i would  say its good and tasty worth trying , but in the same plaza u can find afghani food, burger factory, lebanese cuisine all hallal and attractive .. With such a strong competition these little above mentionned defaults should be rectified asap !! Overall i had a great meal, even tho i had to send bak the sausage because it was cold on the inside, the salad couldve been a little fancier.. I may sound very critical but the competition around is so strong and so the expectations becomes higher :-)  the steak was cooked as requested and melted on my tongue :)! PS : Its not a first date destination"}
{"text":"Food is below average. Tastes 'bassi' (like leftovers) and it is unreasonably pricy. Had the spicy bbq chicken- which was not spicy at all and chicken was so dry and flavourless. Don't really recommend."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Markham Rd. and 14th Ave. in the plaza with Boston Pizza. Ample parking spots in the parking lot because this plaza comprises of a bunch of restaurants and shops. 

[SERVICE] - 2/5
The host/main server was the only person who knew how to manage this place. He was friendly, but this place was severely understaffed for the full house that night, and the wait-time was approx. 45 mins when we arrived without a reservation. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Upscale decor, but there were a lot of tables with large families and kids, so it seemed like more of a casual-to-upscale, yet family-friendly spot. 

[QUALITY] - 3/5
Quality was average, and I feel like they drowned their dishes with a ton of cheese, cream, and other heavy ingredients.

[ORDER] - 3/5
- Fettuccine Kara Mia: chicken breast was average, alfredo sauce was very thick, but the noodles were cooked very well and perfectly al dente

- Chicken Parmesan: one of the few pasta dishes that isn't drenched in a heavy alfredo sauce. Instead, you get a hefty layer of cheese. The chicken parmesan itself was cooked pretty well, but the sauce masked the natural flavours of the chicken. 

[OVERALL] - 2.5/5
Food was average, but honestly, the service was horrible and completely ruined my experience. I wanted to relax and enjoy some Italian food. Instead, after we waited 45 minutes for a table, I felt stressed out as we flagged down waiters for the most essential things like water and utensils."}
{"text":"I have to give them 5 stars in that I'm comparing them to other halal family meal style restaurants with contemporary Canadian menu items. When I compare to other notable options Kara Mia is just better on all accounts -

* food quality and flavour - excellent
* service - so friendly and prompt and attentive 
* comfort - great - enough space, not too loud or too distracting
* portion size and value for $$ is excellent. 

We had two appetizers and 3 main courses (one was a children's entree at $14.99) and the bill was $70 and we had a hard time eating it all.  

The chef always comes to say hello and ask how the meal was.  And they are so personable like family - we have been going for 5 years and they see how my son has gotten taller and has now graduated from chicken fingers to steak.

What more could you ask for?

Highly recommended 

We ate - chicken parm, a spicy pasta of some sort and the kids steak and fries."}
{"text":"I'd recommend this place for their Steaks, but Not their burgers.. The staff were nice and welcoming, the atmosphere and washrooms were nice and clean. I especially recommend the steak with saffron sauce & spinach on top, the price for that was $23, I've tried 2 of their burgers & they just weren't anything special or good.

Have a Beautiful day folks!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends and family. I like the food. There have been a couple of times where I didn't have a good experience. First time, it was Ramadan and they had their buffet which was very low quality food. It seemed as though the food had been prepared well in advance and was sitting there for a while and reheated when the customers came to eat. Second time, it was a Friday evening when I came in with my wife and asked them specifically if they were out of anything and had everything written in the menu. Of course, the lady taking our order told us that the restaurant had everything and that the menu was open for ordering anything. Well, when I asked for what I wanted...she told me, \"Oh, I'm sorry, we don't have that today...we have been out of that for a few days now.\" REALLY? I don't understand how restaurants can function like that. If you don't have something, put that on the menu or tell us that the moment you give us the menu and we sit down. It's that easy!! Giving false hope when you're starving is just plain wrong!!

Anyways, the restaurants itself is nice, spacious, and nicely decorated. The staff are friendly for the most part and the service is good. I won't say that the service is fast, but it's good. The menu selection is amazing though. To get all those different types of meals as HALAL are worth the trip. I had a steak once and it was amazing. There isn't the consistency in their food. There have been days where it's been great and other days it seems like it was whipped up quick without the taste. 

Try it and see for yourself. Lots of great menu options. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Kara Mia is pretty good. I say this for many reasons. Great food, great service, and friendly staff. 

I've been here twice, and both experiences have been pretty good. The first time I went here was on Eid, and miraculously, they were able to seat us without reservations. We ordered several dishes and our food arrived within a reasonable amount of time. Out waitress was very friendly and kept asking us how things were. Her kindness was really appreciated. The second time we went was for my brother's birthday, and the experience was just as good as the first. Friendly staff and good, fresh food. 

Being a Muslim foodie, you could understand why this place excited me! Finally, a halal place that doesn't have the typical burgers or shawarmas or pizza. Some good, fresh, and tasty Italian food for a change? Yes PLEASE! 

The food is a bit on the pricey side, but that's not all that surprising considering the quality of the food and experience. Remember that you're not paying for a shawarma or burger here! :)

I noticed that the head chef was very friendly with all customers, and insisted that they come over and watch him cook. I thought that was really nice!

Some foods I've tried here:
Fettucine Alfredo- 3.5/5
Penne with saffron/mushrooms: 4/5
Regular poutine (no longer on menu) 4/5
Saffron Poutine: 3.5/5
Chicken Parmesan: 3.5/5
Kid's steak (according to brother): 3.5/5
Chicken Caesar salad: 4/5
Mista Salad: 3.5/5

This place is great for a change from the regular halal restaurants you'll find in the GTA, and for that alone, the high rating was given. I definitely will return for some more chicken and steaks! Yum!"}
{"text":"All the taste of food was destroyed by the awful sauce poured on top. The steaks would have been flavorful without the sauce. It could have been put on the side easily. The chicken breast was again destroyed with  store bought canned pasta sauce. Prices are also on the higher side. I don't think we would ever be going back"}
{"text":"This place was awful. Dead quiet on a Thursday night. The server was terrible and never asked if we needed more water or even showed up to take our orders.

This was suppose to be an italian place but it was a mix of south asian and Italian. I had fettuccine with chicken breast, but the pieces that came were not cut evenly, so it seemed like they divide the meat and this was the discard pile. It tasted okay, overly too salty and oily for my liking.

My partner decided to try the South Asian cuisine and it was pretty good. This was their redeeming factor. We paid while we ordered. After we finish the meal, the kitchen incorrectly provide us with two naan's so the server demanded we pay for the extra naan. Since we ate it all already, we paid for it. Though, I don't understand why we should pay for their mistake.  

I will definitely not come there again!"}
{"text":"First time here I had the saffron poutine... Omg it was delicious. Big portions aswell but I still ordered another (this time a family size!). All for me! Yumyum...yum. Service was awesome aswell. Definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"Meh. Don't see what all the fuss is about. The place is nice.. Since it is new.. But the food and atmosphere is meh .. 

If you like screaming children and mediocre wanna be Italian then this place is great. 

Pasta was alright at best, I had the chicken saffron meal and it was also just alright. 

Caesar salad is chopped lettuce with tomatoes and croutons topped with ranch sauce. Yup, ranch sauce and tomatoes. 

2 stars for the atmosphere and nice server. I've had way better \"italian\" food for the same price. This place shouldn't even call itself Italian."}
