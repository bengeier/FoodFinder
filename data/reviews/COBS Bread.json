{"text":"The scones are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!! My favourite is the berry white chocolate scone and it is perfect! Very soft, fluffy, and fresh! The white chocolate is mixed into the batter very well and the berry provides a very good balance between sweet and sour. Makes the best snack/dessert/breakfast!

Their white loaf with seeds (sesame) is also very delicious! I personally like my bread soft and chewy, and Cobs' bread is exactly that! 

Would definitely come back to satisfy my scone cravings and also for their bread!"}
{"text":"Walked into Cob's today to pick up some bread for a dinner party I'm hosting tonight... The place smelled amazing! Fresh bread being baked, and lots of selection.  The lady who served me, Helene, was very knowledgeable with the variety of bread, and even recommended my purchase.  I bought the half baked pizza bread with herbs and olive oil, a great choice for my guests.  Helene was so kind as to offer me a baguette from their freshly made batch, free of charge.  I was amazed at what great customer service this location offered, and I will definitely be back for all my bakery needs!"}
{"text":"First time here. A friend recommended that I buy my bread from this bakery. Usually I just grab whatever on sale at the grocery store.

Bread is fresh and tastes great. I'm no bread connoisseur but this is the best bread I've ever had. Reasonable prices considering quality. Friendly service. I'm surely coming back for more."}
{"text":"This place is fresh and delicious. The staff are amazing as well!  I had the blueberry custard Danish and it definitely hit the spot.  

Will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Always a good experience here. From fresh rolls for Thanksgiving to their delicious lemon-blueberry and pumpkin scones. Spotless store, helpful service every time. :)

Let's not forget all the yummy free samples!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good bread, danishes, scones, cinnamon buns, and pastries. This is my current goto."}
{"text":"Cobs making bread fresh every day without compromise on quality ingredients. Every morning a fresh batch of breads are made to satisfy our hunger for this tasty treat.  All bread at the end of the day are donated to local food banks and charities."}
{"text":"I have tried many types of their baked goods. They are all freshly made everyday. 

I agreed with other Yelpers that their scones are the best! My next favorite is the Tea Time. The bread is so soft and moist with fresh blueberry or apple. Their artisan loaf is very nice as well."}
