{"text":"We come here  every now and then on Sundays after church. It is the quickest thing to grab that actually tastes good.
What I like mostly is that they use real fresh eggs and fry them properly.  At least it tastes like it.

I usually get the bacon burrito and my husband loves the sausage burrito.  The food is consistent and always tastes good."}
