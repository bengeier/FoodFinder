{"text":"This place is the real deal. The chicken shawarma is really good. Great flavour with each bite. Glad they moved to airdrie, saves me the trip back to Calgary. And they deliver. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Ok so those of you familiar with this place know that it is always busy and opened crazy hours to accommodate the cities taxi drivers. The samosas are delicious and cheap and if that's all you want there's no need to wait in line. 
When it comes to the meat and donairs I'm not a huge fan. They only have 4 spits going which means, due to the high volume the meat doesn't cook on the spit. They slice it off and fry it. The sweet sauce is also very runny. I prefer a thick sweet sauce. The taste is status quo and the hours rock if you are dying for shawarma at 3am on the weekend this is the place!"}
{"text":"Shwarma Palace is a solid spot for a decent donair.

Still on my quest for the elusive Great Calgary Donair, I popped into the Palace on 17th on Saturday afternoon.

The dining room is very nicely appointed, a lovely and charming atmosphere for what otherwise appears to be a roadside flyby spot.

The pair behind the counter -- assuming they're the owners -- were delightful. They were cheerful, chatty and pleasant. 

The donair was OK and typical for Calgary, the meat a little on the non-spicy side and the sweet sauce a little on the non-garlicky side.

But the search continues ..."}
{"text":"The place was lined up like  the people are going in  rock star concert.
But amazing the ingredients are incredible,the taste authentic,sooooo goood, feeling after the appetite is fully satisfied.
Try your self.
Feel the speedy-hunger go away.
So deliciously mouth watering."}
{"text":"Delicious!!
I would recommend the beef wrap and that pistachio baklava.
Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Delicious food  but extremely salty. If it was not that salty I would come back.

The staff were nice. My wife asked them too fry everything including vegetables that goes into shawarma and they did that. (She was pregnant and she was not sure about the vegetables)."}
{"text":"If you're look for a big fat meal, get the rice platter, all the meats are delicious, the staff is awesome, freaking love brown people. The food here is great for bulking and I would say lots and lots of carbs, they stack the food real good to the point where you can't finish it, but it's definitely worth every single dollar. If you're around 17th Ave (The Hood one) hit up shawarma palace, cause these people won't do you wrong."}
{"text":"Best shawarma ever hands down. I always go here and get my shawarma. There is always a big line up however they are all very nice and polite people to serve you."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and donairs are fabulous! Ask for extra sauce as you will need it. Hidden gem in forest lawn!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing friendly staff and the food is crave worthy. Can't recommend it enough, but note they don't serve kebabs anymore."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer here. Food was alway great I came back here after 3 months expecting to receive the same exceptional service I always got. But instead I was greeted by a very rude older woman who provided horrible customer service she had a lot of attitude and did not smile whatsoever once. The cashier was also very rude and passive. I will not be coming back to this location again"}
{"text":"I always get the beef donair platter and it is always amazing.  Such a huge portion for only 10 bucks.  Owners are awesome and always friendly when I come in!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! The shawarma wraps and platters are equally good. They offer chicken, lamb , beef and falafel. The meat is very flavourful and the other ingredients are fresh. 

They also sell samosas and baklava if you're in the mood for some extras.

The guys behind the counter are efficient and pleasant. You can tell they try to do a great job putting together every customer's meal even when there is a crazy line. 

I would recommend this spot if you're in the area and want a fast, tasty shawarma for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot.  They are normally open late on weekdays. Always get the #10. It's amazing. They do have a other things but the choices are limited."}
{"text":"By far the best shawarma in Calgary. Chicken Shawarma is great, great price and very friendly staff"}
{"text":"The chicken salad is awesome !! 
The potatoes and garlic sauce amazing !! 
They are always busy when I've been there but they move through the folks in line pretty quickly !!"}
{"text":"We eat at the one in forest heights whenever we come to Calgary. Glad to see one here which is on our way back home with the same high standards and amazing food! Friendly staff as well! Thanks for the baklava for the trip home! It was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I have ordered a large catering order from shawarma Palace twice now and they do not disappoint! The food is high-quality and delicious, the portions are generous, the service was excellent. Honestly can't say enough good things about this place. All of my colleagues at the workshop loved the food and the price can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I ordered their trio platter which was chicken, beef and lamb with veggies and grape leaves (vine leaves) all in all it was ok. The garlic sauce was not garlicky, i felt i was eating mayo and i find that the spices on the meats were a little on the weak side. The hummus was a bit bland. The grape leaves were good. I also ordered a side of hummus, which was about 500ml they gave me one pita bread! Which i was surprised....One pita bread for a 500ml of hummus?? They should include at least three pitas. I actually like Mazaj in downtown...They have amazing garlic sauce and hummus."}
{"text":"First time. Falafel is gross! Baklava is way too buttery, won't be going back. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing taste and open late night! This is our go-to place for good food craving!"}
{"text":"Best swarama I had in Calgary so far. Get the \"Trio\" wrap and enjoy: a) the size - this think big as Swartzi's biceps, b) the taste - yumm - go loaded, no hold back.
The only thing stopping me from givem them the 5 star review was the bathroom's condish.
Update Jan 25: I think all goof things must come to an end.. last visit I wasn't that impressed.. the guy who served me was sweating oven my wrap when he was making it, yuk!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to any one of the Shawarma Palaces and tried one of their platters, you need to get your priorities in order!  I mean, come on, not only will they fill up the plate soo full that you can't help but tippy-tow to your table trying not to drop any of it on the floor but the food is freak delicious!

The service is always great, the food is always amazing, the dining in area is...umm not so great but who the heck cares!

Go try them now!!!!"}
{"text":"Top notch service very friendly staffed and the food is fantastic. The parking lot is very well designed too. And the food is prepared on a production line level of efficiency. Full marks all around from this guy."}
{"text":"Love the mixed Shawarma!!! So good. Would recommend anyone looking for a great shawarma to check it out."}
{"text":"Shawarma Palace is where you go for the best shawarma in the city. I have been a regular customer for several years now and this place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"There was a line-up to order, though the line moved fairly quickly.

Good shawarma place that offers large portions. I ordered the platter ($12.49) and it comes with pita on the side. 
I was also able to ask for hot sauce on the side which was nice of them. 
I received friendly service even though there was a line-up."}
{"text":"Born and raised in the North East, and as a chubby lazy white guy i have eaten A LOT of donairs/shawarma across Calgary and they are pretty damn good, I have had better, but not many..."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, huge portions on the shwarma plate and friendly staff.  Love this place.  Note that my GPS using the Yelp app showed the wrong location in the plaza.  They are actually next to the Macs."}
{"text":"I drove to visit Shawarma Palace on a Saturday Morning, well, MY Saturday morning which turned out to be 12:00 pm.

I ordered their Shawarma and a couple of falafel balls on the side. The Shawarma was adequate in breaking my fast but I have to admit, I've had better elsewhere. Still, the chicken was nicely seasoned and their garlic sweet sauce was pleasantly noticeable. The falafel balls on the other hand, could have used more garlic 

The service was great. It was prompt but a language barrier kept us from having friendly conversation. No biggie, there was a huge line up and they were patient enough to address my questions.

The decor of the place indicated that Shawarma palace used to be a chain fast food joint. They still serve fast food, but in the more appreciated local sense."}
{"text":"BEST SHAWARMA EVER!!!!! Love this place! Meat is always juicy and tasty. Service is great and their thanini is AMAZE!!!! 
You will not be disappointed FOR SURE A STAPLE IN MY
HOUSE!!! 
Mmmmmmm good"}
{"text":"I was home alone so I decided to venture out and try a place I'd never been before, and who doesn't love donairs?!? I've had my fair shake in my life and I'm always very pleased when places have the sweet sauce so that's a bonus point here. Apparently the lamb is mixed with the beef? I was a little disappointed that I couldn't get straight lamb but that's nothing to deduct a star for. I was also disappointed in the wrap job, instead of splitting the pita only halfway to maintain structural integrity he peeled the entire thing back and re wrapped it with little gusto so I was afraid to peel back any more of the wrapper than absolutely necessary lest it fall apart before travelling fully into my mouth. Also my meat was on the flat top for too long and every bite had a slight burnt flavour to it.

Don't get me wrong, I devoured it happily because donairs are killer but this was my most disappointing experience. That being said I will definitely be back in hopes of a better experience."}
{"text":"Slightly ghetto.   A bunch of what look to be regulars. 
A tv above my head blairing.  I like it.   
If you are afraid of the look of the place i wouldn't eat here.   

The shawarma is fantastic.   Just like the newer location in Falconridge.

Yum yum."}
{"text":"I started coming here a while ago.  I was so addicted to this place that I had to force myself to stay away.  It's been a few months since I've ate the chicken shawarma, and you know what?  It's still delicious as ever.  Nobody knows what good shawarma is until they come here.
It's magic in my mouth and food for the soul.  
This place will be a landmark in shawarma history."}
{"text":"Delicious food with reasonable price. But, the place is not clean. If you are looking for a big portion with a low  price I recommend it. I should mention the place is not fancy!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was meh.  We ordered Shawarma platters and we wanted the meat and veggies wrapped up but they would not wrap it for us! They said if they wrapped it they would have to charge us more. They saiid most people eat it with a fork. To me  That's like ordering a cheeseburger with no mustard and them saying u can't get it like that without paying more. 
Also the service was kind of slow. It was a holiday Monday night and there was quite a few people in there but it was not packed. 
I'd probably go bak again cause I really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Love the sauces. The sweet is really sweet. And the Lamb beef is killer - tastes like real steak and lamb."}
{"text":"Very nice food at a decent price. I had the Chicken Shawarma with rice. 

Enjoyed the pickled turnip. I will order this again, and the portions were very good. pictures on the site are accurate for sure.

K"}
{"text":"'Large beef, extra meat please!' is what I always say when I come in. Hidden on International 17th Ave, this place is one of the gems Calgary has to offer.

For me, I always ask for little sauce cause I think they generally load up on that. Every time I eat here (which is very late), I always taste that little crisp in the beef, which I like. I don't recall any other shawarma places in this city that have that kind of texture. One of my two favorite shawarma places to go in this city. My only knock on them is that I wish they would put more spice in the beef."}
{"text":"Shawarma Palace must be popular with multiple locations across the city (including Montgomery, Falconridge and Airdrie). This place has INSANELY good/late hours (1am on most days but 4AM on Friday and Saturday). Perfect for some late night eats.

I came on a holiday Monday just before noon and it was pretty empty. Couple people took their orders to go and that was it. The staff are a well tuned machine; friendly, fast and organized. You order up front and get your food almost instantaneously.

Menu is shawarmas and platters along with a few side items. Don't forget about the baklava!

- Mix platter - chicken, lamb & beef (#11) ($12.49) - I wanted to try all three of their meats so went with the mixed platter. I'm always a fan of lamb but the winner here was surprisingly the chicken; so moist, tender and flavourful. Rice was addictively good along with the dolop of garlic sauce they add to the potatoes.

Portion size is generous and a platter can easily be shared between two. I had leftovers for the next day and even saved the hummus to spread on my bagels.

- Baklava ($1.00/piece) - buy 4 pieces, get 1 free or buy 7 pieces, get 3 free. I went with the former but should have got the latter. Homemade, fresh, delicious baklava. They even let you choose which pieces you want but I let the worker pick for me. All I know is I want more."}
{"text":"Great service! The guys behind making your lunch and quick and understand to your wrap or platter needs! Food comes quick and taste great! I have been to both locations and nothing to hate about it! I love it!"}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for the best Shawarma....and Shawarma Palace is up there. My godchild is just as obsessed with Shawarma as I am so she accompanies me to every Shawarma establishment.  Possibly to add to the experience; should I miss something. 
Anyway, this place is small. It's more about the food than the ambience. Which is what I prefer. Don't get me wrong; the service is great.  Just don't expect to be wowed by the decor or scenery.  
It's straight up tasty food, and served promptly.  It is the best I have had so far.  My godchild ordered a beef donair and I ordered a chicken donair.  Both were incredibly satisfying in both flavor and portion.  
I'm all about flavorful and juicy meat and this place is hard to beat when it comes to delicious shawarma!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy, and for good reason. The food is delicious! All of the ingredients are super fresh, and the various shawarma meats are hot and juicy. 

They offer shawarma wraps as well as platters, and also have a vegetarian menu and lots of sides like salads, samosas, and baklava. I have been here twice and have had both the beef wrap with samosas and baklava and the chicken platter. The platters are A LOT of food, so they are the best choice for when you're starving."}
{"text":"Got a falafel wrap from this place and boy was I pleasantly surprised. Well priced for the amount of wrap you get. My friends got a lamb/beef plate and they enjoyed it as well. The staff seems to be overworked but all three of them were super pleasant and patient with everyone. Thanks for a great quick meal."}
{"text":"I have a good friend who lives in Forest lawn so I pass by Shawarma Palace several times a month. If I have the time I always stop in and get a large \"mix chicken, lamb & beef\" shawarma. It is so freaking good and sturdier than many competitors. 

The sauces are fantastic and they load it on. The selection of veggies is always fresh and good. I have never had any complaints here. The workers are polite and friendly. You can pick your toppings as your shawarma is made. 

I will keep coming back here. Note that because it is so good there is often a line. Sometimes I wait 15-20 minutes but it's worth it!! 

The only downsides are that it is sometimes quite hot in the store, and it can be a little cramped if there is a line and people are eating in. But whatever, like I said it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Now this is what I'm talking about. Finally I have found fresh, delicious, mouthwatering Shawarma that reminds me of my years in Montreal. Shish taouk, mediterranean food, pitas... Whatever you want to call it this is what I've been looking for. This place has awesome food, gorgeous and polite staff, and enough tables to eat in, but not too many so it didn't feel like a chain or impersonal.

Taste, quality, value... This place is an easy five star joint. I was actually so busy eating and enjoying myself I forgot to take a picture of the large pita!! 

It's a dive. It's a busy active dive with lineups usually. We spoke to the patrons next to us and the line never stopped the whole time we were there. It's a little place that can seat probably about 20 people, one washroom... So it's not the place to take the woman you are trying to impress but... Once you have won her heart... Take her here and enjoy food.

We ordered a large beef and lamb pita and a chicken platter which came with rice and potatoes and salad and fresh sauce... It was such good food."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for the past couple years. Never disappointed. 

I've always ordered beef/lamb platter and for $10.50 tax included. So much food for that price. Much better than shrwama knights or whatever it's called down on 17th, plus you get more food. Open late on weekends till 4

edit: prices have gone up. $12.50 I believe now"}
{"text":"This is life! Seriously delicious!!! Staff are very friendly, food is amazing AND they deliver!! Thank you for coming to airdrie!!"}
{"text":"Love this place for late night eats. Always good.
Baklava is awesome. Good prices and deals. Staff is awesome."}
