{"text":"I've came to this place many times, I love the food we get crunch rolls, tekka rolls and eel rolls, the garlic chili edemame and cucumber salad.  The prices are great during happy hour. Usually the service is great when we get served by an asain girl with short hair or a white girl who happily serves us but the last few times we got this bigger guy. I accidently ordered a seaweed salad instead of the cucumber salad last time he served us literally 3 minutes later as i realized it, the server was no where to be found and it was coming to the table oops that was my bad i guess.... (i dont know if it was that because i was so nice and apologetic) we almost felt like he was avoiding us after that the only time he asked if we needed anything was to take our order and once towards the very end, he would fill our waters and leave without seeing if we needed anything else or how it was not even making eye contact. He wasn't busy he had like 3 small tables and was standing by the host stand. The asain girl checked up on us more then him. I work in the food service industry and this was dissapointing how his service was inattentive.  I felt kind of uncomfortable. Oh well ill still go back hopefully he's nicer or we get the girls lol."}
{"text":"It always has been enjoyable eating here!  Good, fresh food - great price. I especially like that they have Asahi on draft. I like to have the Uni here and their sashimi is terrific. I would recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Came to South Point for a three day convention and ended up eating here three times during my trip. The poke bowl and spicy tuna bowl is amazing! The portion is big enough for two! I wish they did a bowl with half poke and half spicy tuna. 

Tonkatsu ramen was also good. The broth wasn't salty. I would not order the udon at this place. It looked and taste like the udon packet we buy at an asian store.

I would have given this place a 5 star if it wasn't for one of their employee. 

The girl at the reception desk was the rudest person my group had to deal with. If you do not like you job, don't take it out on your customers. 

We had a group of 8 and when we got there, there were plenty of seats open. We asked the girl to put out name down and she said its a 20 minute wait. We ask if we could sit separate to make it easier and faster to be seat and all she said was give me a minute and rolled her eyes at us. We waited 15 minute and asked her how much longer do we have to wait and she would not reply. A group of 7 people came and she sat them right away. We asked she why we can't get seated when half the restaurant was free and she said they have a list of people waiting before us. THERE WAS NO ONE THERE! This girl said we can't get seated because the other people are not there yet for their dinner reservations. Ten minute later and yet no one else showed up. We finally got seated after another girl came to take over the position.

Horrible hosted! Other then her, our waiter was great and very informative!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Greeted right away. The sushi is delicious. My favorite was the garlic shrimp. I ordered a second round , it was that good. They were out of uni, but they recommended some other choices that were delicious. The quality of the sushi is fantastic. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Super slow service. Not busy but we waited like 20 minutes to get our order taken. Don't order the chicken lettuce wraps. Don't know what it was, but it couldn't be chicken. When our rolls came we had to ask for wasabi and ginger.  They brought three out of our six drinks. We had to ask for the complete order. Unfriendly."}
{"text":"This place along with Island sushi in Henderson is probably my favorite Hawaiian style sushi restaurant in town. The slight difference between the two is that Zenshin's menu is more Japanese focused. I just learned recently that they're under the same management, what a coincidence!  I'm all about the island fusion flavor so I had high hopes. The layout and seating was quite clean and modernized with a centered sushi bar. We were a party of six, and gorging is what we came for. It's an Asian Hog Feast is what I call it. So the dinner started with Ahi Poke Tacos, Eggplant fries, fried calamari, dynamite green mussels, fried soft shell crab, and tons of mouth watering rolls specifically the 8 second bull ride. The eggplant fries and ahi poke tacos was the highlight of the appetizers. If you're itching for ramen or anything soup base, try the oxtail soup or the Ton Katsu ramen. :)"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Happy Hour close to home. Great, fresh sushi and delicious pizzas. Not to mention the drink specials....a great deal all around. Always good service. Never disappointed here."}
{"text":"Service is poor...I think they need to hire more manager because the guy in black whom I called reasoned out that there is only one server around when they were all standing in front desk and my order was served by their manager... my tonkatsu ramen is at par....I was expecting the pork belly but you can barely see the two sliced portion..."}
{"text":"Although our server was quite polite, she got our order wrong and service was extremely slow. Just to get silverware and soy sauce took a long time...and it was a slow day! Lastly, my wife and daughter's teriyaki chicken was raw and had to be replaced! They tried to make up for it, but there's just to many wrongs to make this right. Sad and disappointing."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times. Love their happy hour. Sushi tastes fresh. Our favorite roll is the Crunch Roll. We get it everytime we eat there. The eggplant fries are SO GOOD! You have to try them if you haven't already. 

We tried the karaage chicken which was just okay, and the teri beef sliders. Those were good but such a small portion. Can't expect a lot from \"sliders\" anyways. 

Service can be a bit better. Especially since it's not too busy. At least that's how it is whenever we go.

Overall, a good experience. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service at reasonable prices. If you like creative sushi, there's a lot to choose from - had the garlic shrimp roll and 8 Second Bull Ride roll, which were very tasty. I'm.a big fan of oxtail, and highly recommend both the oxtail soup and oxtail curry. Try the crime brûlée for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour 2 to 6 daily.  Plus staff very nice. Beer 3. Sake 5. Cocktail 6. Karaage chicken. 450. Best hamachi Kama 6.  Rolls 5/6. And mini pizza for non sushi eaters at 6..... And movie theater upstairs.  Great from anywhere on town but especially us in south"}
{"text":"I really wish this place was even an average level sushi and Japanese restaurant but its not the case. The pork katsu was dry with an unusual batter. The sushi rolls and sashimi were so so but overpriced compared with other Vegas places. I think this place might be just feeding on tourists who dont know better. Do yourselves a favor and go to one of the stand alone all you can eat sushi places in town."}
{"text":"I absoulty love this place my hubby and I eat here almost twice a week its the freshest sushi we have had the baked alasken is our fav.Howver im basing 4 stars on this due to the horrible service we recieved for the first time and it wasent even busy.I ordered miso soup 
had to ask the waiter 4 times for the soup never recieved,our drinks were never refilled had to ask a differnt server to refill our drinks,also the server forgot one of the rolls we ordered and when we asked him.about it he rudely said that we never ordered another roll,when we got our bill the server charged us for the soup and roll we never recieved he argued w us and said its only a couple dollars is it a big deal? My response i told him Im npt paying for something we didnt recieve.So bottom line we will be back and hopefully we wont get the same.server"}
{"text":"The happy hour menu is very well priced. The staff is always very friendly and the service is great. This is one of my go to places when i am craving oxtail soup!!! Delicious soup, if you haven't had it you should try it."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great meal and experience! Chris and Jesse at the bar were fantastic. They really knew the menu- their recommendations were spot-on. We had a couple of appetizers, our favorite was the ahi tacos. Yummy! I had the Kobe ribs and my fiancée had the oxtail curry. It was all delicious! We can't wait to go back. I agree with the other yelps- this a nice, clean, comfortable restaurant."}
{"text":"Here for a tournament at the South Point. Heard about the placethrough friends. The place was packed for a late night snack. Found out they do a late night happy hour. Great meal, great service. Will be back. Great food...great prices."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to eat here after it's been about a year since they've opened. I went in during happy hour around 2:30 PM on a Thursday. Not a busy crowd at that time and it's a pretty spacious restaurant so I'm liking it already. Right away I'm greeted by Leo who is by the way a genuinely very social person and good sushi chef. Whenever I look at the menu I'm never really sure what I want. So I'm always open to suggestions. And Leo made his right away! Most of the rolls were $3-$4 and they had some that were five or six.  I had their 777 roll, Salmon poke, fried oysters. $2 for Asahi beer! Pretty good rolls. I looked over their entire menu and they have a full selection and a few interesting menu items. Overall the service was very friendly. Most importantly though the service was very quick from Leo. Of course there weren't very many people in his section. But I don't know how many times I've sat down in a restaurant that didn't have a lot of people in there, yet the service seemed very slow. And sometimes when I'm dining alone I don't seem very talkative, but he got me to be social. He also let me know what was going on at the Southpoint and not just at Zenshin, such as the $5 movie specials at the movie theater. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"We took our family of four and all of us thought this place was so delicious. Staff is incredibly friendly service is great. My kids ate all of there food and  my son said he felt good as new after a great meal. 
The sushi was amazing everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese food and a neighbor recommended this. I was at first hesitant just by the name Zenshin - it didn't sound Chinese. We soon realized it was Japanese. Ok so our neighbor has some trouble distiguishing between Asian food.  The ramen was too salty. The sushi platter was good though and fresh. The green tea was ok but when it was refilled, they refilled it with room temp tea! I love Japanese food but I probably won't go come back here and I don't think I can recommend this place neither."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend and this place was actually inside the resort we were staying at. I was skeptical because how could a Resturaunt in a resort be good, especially sushi. I ordered a couple of rolls , the Tamago and Crunch roll. Both were really good . I will eat here again before I leave town. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"Lunch Special Wagu Burger was Unbelievable.  It came with egg plant fries that was perfect. Service gets 5 Stars.  Wife had the fried noodles   We shared California Rolls. Burger is hands Dow the Best deal in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had a big group event at the restaurant and cannot say enough about how great management was to set up the event with, food was delicious and outstanding service all night.  Even with a group of over 20+, the servers kept all of our drinks filled without requests and constantly kept the buffet filled, including the sushi rolls!  All the servers and our assigned Manager, Michael, were super friendly and the best team I've ever had at a large group event.

We had Chinese chicken salad, Silverado roll, rainbow roll, yakisoba, rice, garlic chicken and beef teriyaki.  The sushi and garlic chicken were everyone's favorites, although everything was devoured.  The chicken was very flavorful and not greasy, despite it being fried.

The evening surpassed everyone's expectations and we will definitely book another dinner here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service! Our waiter Rory was stellar! So on it! But I noticed the entire wait staff was great and very attentive, even the hostess was polite and the manager came out to check on every table as well. That's class. With that said, the sushi rolls, miso soup, salad and drinks we had were all scrumptious and made to perfection. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, and a decent value. Service was a little slow. Though the manager noticed this and brought over an extra tempura rolls. A good lunch."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times the past couple weeks after a poker session. The food has been very good but the service is just awful. Servers are never around and food takes forever to be served when the restaurant is not busy. 

Food is not so good to make up for the slow service."}
{"text":"Good price on happy hour. The foods are taster too. Must try.. Happy hour from 2-6 pm."}
{"text":"This is a place off the beaten path.... I came there because of all places, my parents raved about the oxtail soup.  Yes, who would think there would be that on the menu? Sure enough, there it was.  Anyway,  I enjoyed the decor and the service. 
Here are the menu items we selected:
Dynamite Green Mussels, eggplant fries, unagi roll, ahi poke bowl, seaweed salad, tempura style banana split...

All I can say is, it was all very good.... I was very happy with all of it, great flavors, freshness, and presentation.  I will come back!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I went to Zenshin on the day after their opening so the wait was not terrible. My hubby and I ordered:

The tonkotsu ramen:
- Braised pork in the ramen was amazzzzzing!

Misoyaki black cod:
- This was my favorite dish! The fish was soooo delicious and the sauce was fantastic! It was served with bok choy and rice. I would definitely go back for this alone!

777 roll:
- I was weary about ordering anything with soft shell crab because I had never had it before but it was soooo good! 

Spicy tuna roll:
- A classic staple. Always good. :)

Len Ying drink: (I think that was what it was called)
- Really interesting. It is a hibiscus flavored drink that was recommended by our bartender. Never had anything like it!

Strawberry cocktail of some sort:
- Also really interesting. Very very tasty! I was skeptical because it had muddled fresh strawberries and a thai chili inside but it ended up being so good!

Green tea tiramisu:
- A nice light dessert after a big meal. :) 

Mini malasadas: 
- Served with a dollop of custard and chocolate, it was the perfect dessert to share along with the green tea tiramisu. 

The owners did Zenshin right. Food and service was amazing! We especially enjoyed the company of Katie, our bartender/server. She was very personable and accommodating. When in Vegas, I would definitely go again!

P.S. They are located in the back left corner of South Pointe Hotel and Casino."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious. Service is great, staff is friendly and gotta love their Happy Hour Prices! Everything on their menu is a must. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Happy hour from 2 pm to 6 pm. The Hamachi  Kama still yummy and meaty. Even the prices keep creeping up. HH menu still ok but limited. Even better if Leslie is your server. She's alway friendly and great."}
{"text":"Food is pretty ok. Service is on point. I order individual rolls include the happy hour rolls and still came out pretty pricey. The creme brûlée was good tho.(one extra star for it )"}
{"text":"The restaurant was an unexpected treat. My husband and I ate dinner there 4 out of 7 nights we were in Vegas. 
 We would have a couple of appetizers and split an order of Sushi. Favorite appetizer was the Mizo Glazed Pork Belly. Favorite dessert was the Mini Malasados.
The service was excellent. The staff was friendly and kept our water glasses full."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi in Vegas. They now have a happy hour menu!  The little Asian bartender is the best."}
{"text":"Probably THE best sushi restaurant I have been to. The staff were amazing from the moment we walked in (and even on the phone beforehand). They were all attentive, helpful and friendly, regardless as to whether they were specifically serving us or not. The manager came around and checked up on us and chatted to us which was a nice touch. 
We had a Travel Zoo offer, and in combination with happy hour we ate ourselves into Food Coma's for less than $30 each including beers. 
Next time I'm in Vegas I will DEFINITELY be returning. 
100% recommend - thanks for the awesome experience."}
{"text":"Wow! !!  Just wow!   The friendliest staff.   Everyone was so helpful.  The food is delicious.   I really enjoyed everything.   I highly recommend this place.   I haven't had REAL Asian food in years.  So glad I stopped in.  Thank you,  Zenshin!!!"}
{"text":"We ate there the other night when the Patriots were taking down the Falcons in the final seconds of Sunday night football and when we all saw Walter White kick the bucket.

Started out with the Mussels. They were probably the best ones we've had in a long time. Better than Sushi Mon, Sin City and Sushi Wa. 

The roll selection was pretty simple but everything tasted fresh and hit the spot after a long Sunday Funday.

I would go back!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant, so I was a little sketchy about trying it out in it's first couple of days of opening, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Food was amazing and reasonably priced, too.  The only thing I was hoping to order, but wasn't on the menu was Tendon (tempura ride bowl).  So, I ordered the rib-eye..... =) =) =)  My advice - try the rib-eye!

Zenshin is a great addition to the South Point Casino!  If you like Japanese food, go check it out."}
{"text":"Took a group of 40+ people.  Great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I love this place! The workers are very friendly and foods amazing. I come in frequently when Sushi Chef Chris is working. He'll always custom an off the menu item and make something fun and tasty!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time last week specifically for their happy hour. There was a small wait (obviously popular towards the end time of 6!) but the hostess did a great job managing and turning the tables for the guests. I have had poor experiences with restaurant food quality during their happy hour periods but this exceeded my expectations. Though I didn't order from the regular menu, all of the items ordered from the happy hour menu were fantastic - didn't get the impression that these were \"downgraded\" versions of their full price dishes. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour ! Our family loves to eat at this  restaurant. We love the sliders. Teriyaki pizza,  crunch roll , 777 roll , and poke.  The waitress was so nice and friendly and  the food was great , Asahi  beer  for only $2.  We look forward to eating here everytime we come to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I am an avid sushi eater. I've tried so many places in so many different cities and I'm yet to find better tasting sushi rolls & appetizers than this spot. I've tried everything on the menu over the span of my last 20 visits and everything is a home run! At first glance, I never would've chosen to eat sushi at the South Point lol. But just trust the kid."}
{"text":"First, I love the menu selection, but then disappointed after trying some of the food..

I'm an avid sushi eater. I know the difference between a good quality fish or not. I ordered assorted sashimi, and it doesn't taste fresh at all. It's chewy. A good sashimi supposed to feel like it \"melts\" on your mouth.

Another failed dish: Spicy Tuna Bowl. Not authentic at all and they smothered it with thick layers of unappetizing mayonnaise-based sauce.

The okay dishes I tried were beef teriyaki bento box and tempura. The bento box was honestly, a good value. Comes with rice, pickled cucumbers, roasted kombucha, and salad. Good portions of food and taste was standard.

Service was meh. The hostess was your typical teenager with attitude. 
The server was friendly at first, but then gets too friendly afterwards. I know she was just doing her job to give me recommendations, but she's pressuring me too much. She offered dessert for like three times and every time she ask, I would have to say 'no' multiple times. 
The chef.. was too slow.. It wasn't even crowded. There were only about three tables out..

Bottom line.. If you have to eat here, just order the Bento Box sets. It's the only one that's worth it. If you want to order sushi, don't expect it to be fresh or in a good quality."}
{"text":"I just spent the most disastrous weekend in Las Vegas. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. I stopped in here to drown my sorrows in a 777 roll and a beer. The roll was delicious and the beer hit the spot; both arrived within minutes of ordering even though they had just gotten hit with numerous tables at the same time. But what was truly 5, no, 10-star worthy was the incomparable service. I was treated with such kindness by my waitress and the manager, Bronson, that it totally turned my trip around. Thank you to the incredible staff. Nothing goes with great sushi better than attentive and generous service. I'll definitely be back, and I hope all of you Yelpers stop by, too."}
{"text":"Love the menu at this new SouthPoint restaurant!  Try the Double Down roll with salmon skin that is deliciously bacon-like with uzu aioli.  No need to dip the whole thing in soy and wasabi.  Also terrific were the specialty sashimi dishes - especially the Jalapeno Yellowtail - which boasts a truffled ponzu sauce - so good.  Finally, don't miss the BBQ grilled beef short ribs -my husband, the non-sushi eater, really enjoyed these.  Next time I go I have promised myself to try the oxtail soup and the coconut bread pudding - can't wait!"}
{"text":"I got nothing against with this restaurant, food is good and service is good. But i noticed everytime i order for pick up, i always missing something, like my soup or salad etc. Its not the only first time this happend. Kinda dissapointing now that they dont check the order before giving it to the customers."}
{"text":"Love it... Went there a few times.  The Happy Hour is pretty good.  it is located in the South Point Hotel about 4 to 6 miles off the strip.  Every time we went the attendants were very nice and helpful.  I love the 777 and the drinks!"}
{"text":"Amazing! This place serves very authentic and delicious Asian food. Our waiter was very kind and knew what he was talking about. I got udon and it was perfect! My whole family enjoyed what they ordered, and I don't think you can go wrong with going here. (Plus, the prices aren't insanely high.)"}
{"text":"We liked the sushi.  It was the best part of our dinner.    We ordered a dinner entree, the rib-eye.  We requested it to be sliced   since we were sharing.  When the server brought it out, it was cold.  It was probably sitting in the kitchen waiting for the server to pick it up, service is terrible.   The soy sauce container was empty, asked the server for some more, he never came back.  It's the little the things that makes a great dinner.  The staff needs more training.   Don't go there for service, you won't get it.  And the hostess/cashier had no customer services skills.  Didn't bother asking how dinner was, took our check and told us the amount."}
{"text":"If you have any sort of food allergies and miss having your favorite Asian dishes come here. I am allergic to gluten, dairy, and garlic and was able to have a myriad of dishes. When I eat here I get genuinely overwhelmed with their options! Great place all around."}
{"text":"We heard the food was good, but when we got in line and after 10 minutes we got to the front, we agreed to the bar and we're told we were next for a table and decided to wait for one to be cleared.   After 4 other couple's  were seated ahead of us,  then we were offered a bar seat, after 10 more minutes, which we took.   Even when no food had arrived, and 2 more tables opened they let us stew at the bar with no food. 
Food was good, but service lacking."}
{"text":"Braised ribs, spider roll, and green tea tiramisu - all were wonderful.  Waitstaff led by Garrett was perfect.  Front desk/host area are too passive with guest waiting at front but that's just a minor bump.

http://tinypic.com/r/30rwa3c/8"}
{"text":"The food here is expensive and is not worth. I found their sushi rolls really bland and they just make me bloat in a bad way. The wait was ridiculous too, we waited about 40 min just for our food, we also had to wait 15 min to get in and it was just not worth the time and money. Their title of \"best sushi\" is just false, and their customer service was a bit lacking also because no one would ever take notice of customers. I wouldn't come here again"}
{"text":"Try the eggplant fries, my friends. Umm, so good. We went two days in a row. The happy hour prices made me happier on the second visit. We tried the sushi the second night-spicy tuna, crunch roll, and California roll. These were pretty tasty and good quality food.  My husband liked the garlic chicken bowl.  Friendly service. We'd visit again."}
{"text":"This place was never that great when it was first opened, but the service was great then.  Now it got worse!  I went there by myself this one night, this hostess refused to seat me...she asked me to rather sit at the counter, or to just stand there to wait while there were many empty tables available.  I asked her about those tables, she told me they were reserved, which was a lied.  Because no ones ever came in for it.  Then this waitress named 'Jane', the biggest rude air head I have ever seen.  And here's come this food runner, absolutely rude, rude, rude.  'Rude' is probably his last name.  I believe those people have never received any kind of training before working there.  Although these two managers were running around the whole place acted like they were real busy.  But then again, if they were doing such a good job/management, why would the place be so bad?  The sushi were not fresh, they should not be serving it at all.  I am the kind of person who look for quality, especially when it comes to sushi.

The only good food in here was this 'Eggplant Fries', and that's about it.   

Overall, it was just a horrible experience!  And Warming...DO NOT go there to eat by yourself!  Singles are not welcome there.  They do discriminate against single customers.  I've read one of the man who wrote a review about this place earlier, and he also noticed about the similar issue.  Wow...isn't that a shame!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food but today my friend with shellfish allergies was individually approached by restaurant management to confirm her allergy and preparation needs. Extra mile much appreciated."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I had high hopes. I ordered the Hawaiian roll... Yes, it was good.. However the time out took to get my order was unacceptable. We were with a large group, that took up 3 large round tables, you would think that the management would have better prepared for this. 2 people at my table had to send their food back due to lack of freshness and incorrect preparation. The 18% gratuity they add to your Bill its a joke.. The Service was not worth that tip...  I guess they figure, I'm getting a tip anyway so Service doesn't need to be good. Getting our Bill paid was a nightmare. We asked for separate checks.. They only allow 2 per table.. Well our group was 7 separate checks..  My portion of the Bill was only 21.00.. Having to pay a tip of nearly 50% for crappy Service just killed me!  Not due to the amount, but because that tip was not with the Service.. I'm giving 3 stars because my roll was good. Will I ever come back? Probably not.. My regular sushi place is bar none, hands down, number one in food and Service."}
{"text":"Being in the F&B industry/management for over 13 years, I am confident to say that this restaurant will do well. The affordable prices along with the quality of food will be hard to beat. The Miso Cod was cooked perfectly and their sushi quality is right up there with the best. Service was efficient, friendly, and helpful with menu recommendations. I like to think of myself as a \"Foodie\" and have no problem recommending this restaurant to my fellow \"Foodies\". Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a big fat \"0\" but in order to write a review I had to give it at least one star..... Unless you want the most horrible customer service don't come here! If  Garret is your server RUN!!!! He is the rudest waiter I have ever came across in these 34 years of my life. I never write reviews but I had to after coming to this place. McDonalds has better customer service! At least McDonald ask if there's anything else I would like! Garrett was just an a@$hole! He didn't even ask if my husband wanted something to drink and when my husband ask for a drink he just walked away in the middle of ordering and just brought our check!  I've tasted better sushi! This place isn't all that! Your better off getting some nachos upstairs. Remember if a big fat Japanese man named Garret comes your way, RUN!!"}
{"text":"My husband has been coming here for happy hour while he's in Vegas for business. I came out and reluctantly joined him to Zenshin as I do not like fish or sushi...or so I thought until I experienced sushi in the hands of Aaron! Aaron is great, his suggestions are spot on, he remembers us and what we have had and liked, and his sushi rolls are beautiful and delicious. 

The happy hour is a great deal. I've been able to try many items at an affordable cost. The crunch roll is my favorite but I am now a big fan of the 777. The garlic edamame is fantastic! The Asahi beer is nice and cold off the tap and refreshing. Jesse is a terrific bartender we are always happy when he is there! The service is always wonderful and we have no complaints. Our visits have been friendly, inviting, delicious, and enjoyable.

I am now the the one begging my husband to take me out to see Aaron, Jesse and the rest of the crew at Zenshin!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was with a friend of mine who knew the owner / manager so of course we were treated like royalty. This time I came with myself and my boyfriend and of course we were 30 minutes before closing. And the waiter wasted no time to remind us about this. The food tasted like it had been sitting out all day long, and despite the fact that we waited for everything it didn't taste fresh at all! I would suggest that unless you know someone who works here and/or are you willing to spend the extra money then maybe it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Best happy hour have eaten there  probably 20 times everything we have ordered was good staff very friendly"}
{"text":"We've dined here several times in the past few years and every time it gets better. From the service to the drinks & awesome cuisine. 
Our waiter Rory was exceptional from suggestions to answering our many questions. We might drop in later for late Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Zenshin is located within South Point, an already great casino hotel.  What would make it better, one would wonder?  A great Asian restaurant, yes!  During my four day reservation at South Point, for the first two days, the family went to Zenshin to try out some good Japanese food.  It worked!  The food tasted great, and it came at a pretty low price.  Also, I know I say this quite often, but I rarely experience bad service: the staff came by, did not neglect us, and did not annoy us.  We never had to return anything.  The atmosphere was like the rest of South Point itself: clean, roomy, yet modern and smoke smell free.
     Food quality:  In Japanese, the literal meaning of \"Zenshin\" is \"advancement, progression, or moving forward\", as can be seen on the Zenshin restaurant page on the South Point website.  This food is truly progressive, in that it makes one consider: why can't all Japanese restaurants be half-decent? Good, tasty, but filling food indeed.  There exists a large selection of selection for but a few dollars per order, and some novel combinations.  Main dishes include such delicacies as Tempura Udon.  I genuinely enjoyed every bit.
     Food quantity:  Again, for only a few bucks, a very good quantity.  I think it's also AYCE, which comes at a great price as well.
     Service:  The staff here are like South Point staff themselves.  Also, cue the atmosphere.  Staff are personable, speedy/efficient, and seem truly intent on living up to the restaurant's name through making progress.
     Atmosphere:  The restaurant logo is a bright reddish sunset, which symbolizes the simplicity and efficiency of the Japanese culture, where the restaurant's dishes hold their roots.  The Japanese flag itself is to symbolize progress, so that's a good job done on Zenshin's part.  The interior itself doesn't reek of casino-ish smoke, which not even the actual lobby does.  The whole thing is modern, should I say.
     Overall:  For an Asian restaurant inside of a casino hotel spa, it sure delivers on its primary message: to make progress in not only Vegas, but the entirety of America.  It's a pretty good restaurant too, with a flair of uniqueness.  Definitely try it out if you're into sushi or different Asian food, which I am!

{"text":"We had dinner at Zenshin last night and it was fantastic. We always go to south point, but it was our first time in this restaurant. It's very nice and clean. The food was amazing . Beef teriyaki entree was very good. We love everything we ordered. But we were more amazed with the service. Gloria is excellent, very fast , efficient and genuinely friendly with a wonderful smile. We ended up leaving her a big tip. All in all was one of our bests experienced. You will be seeing us more often."}
{"text":"I am very impressed! Stayed at south point, for Penn's director's cut kickoff party. Went for the happy hour at lunch time 2pm on Saturday.

We got asahi draught beer on cheap, a big seaweed salad, exceptional pork ramen bowl, and a Philadelphia roll that was generously large and had perfect fish. Amazing banana fosters lumpia to complete the experience. 

Shout out to stellar service from Christine! Fantastic experience, do not miss it."}
{"text":"Walked in with family for some great Poke (Hawaiian raw fish) it was beautiful and awesomely tasty. Followed by a variety of sushi - my favorite was the Ultimate Shrimp, it was so 'ono. We also had the Unagi, the Hawaiian along with miso soup, eggplant fries and finished off with the best malasadas mini size on custard, with chocolate drizzled on top - best I've ever had! Want to go back next trip!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic!  Worth checking out!  We ordered the shrimp and vegetables tempura appetizer.  I ordered the spicy tuna classic sushi roll which was very fresh and tasty!!   I scarfed it down.  I would have ordered seconds but I knew I would have to finish eating my daughter's food.  I ordered the chicken teriyaki entree for my girls to share.  The portion was a good size and it came with soup and a small salad.  Needless to say, we had leftovers.  The chicken was very light and delicious. The sauce was not too heavy or sweet.  Grandma ordered the shrimp tempura rice bowl which my youngest loved!  Grandma said her dish was very delicious!  

Next time we are in town, I would make sure to stop by here again."}
{"text":"Good food at a great price when you go at happy hour and also great service!  Best time to go is happy hour which is held like twice a day except weekends."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant. Happy hour is the best. Half price. Great sushi rolls, fried oysters.salads etc. Great atmosphere and fabulous prices."}
{"text":"It gave my food poisoning, it keeps making me write things so I'm going to keep going about how it gave me food poising for about 3 days missed out on work not bad service just bad sushi"}
{"text":"Had dinner recently at Zenshin in the South Point Casino- great food, as usual. My favorite appetizer is  the ahi poke tacos - I could probably eat a dozen."}
{"text":"Go here, seriously go here.. especially if you are staying at the South Point.  It has the best wine menu seriously affordable during happy hour.   I had delicious Oyster Bay Sauvignon   for $5 a glass and Asahi COLD DRAFT for $3 with some outrageously good crab meat sliders.  I wanted to try the lunch special wagyu beef hamburger which looked sooo good but I didn't have time.  It was around $10 full sized and topped with an egg.
Great ambiance, great service.  Not snobby at all."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since they opened and the food, service and quality have been consistently great.  The sushi is pretty good but their cooked appetizers are the standouts.

The Standouts:  

Dynamite mussels - two savory morsels in every half shell.  So good.
Fried Calamari - crispy fried on the outside, tender on the inside.  Comes with a nice sweet mayo sauce which gives you a great sweet/salty combo.
Mini Tuna Tacos - so fresh, with a little spicy bite from the wasabi guacamole.
Pork Belly - honorable mention.  Very tasty with the little white buns.

Happy Hour prices are great for the above apps."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in town and nicest waitress ever! Good food, good prices. Unfortunately I forgot her name"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my mom, brother-in-law and his wife at Zenshin at the SouthPoint Casino tonight. Mom and I go there every time I'm in town because the food is soooo good. 

What made tonight's visit so terribly bad was the Zenshin manager and his 2 hosts wouldn't allow My brother-in-law in to the restaurant with his seeing eye dog. I guess he doesn't look \"blind enough\" walking around with his new pup- who was wearing a fully labeled GUIDE DOG harness! 

The manager asked for my brother's \"blind\" credentials and after reviewing his IDs insisted casino security come and verify his dog was a service dog and give her a pink tag. The manager said it was part of SouthPoint's new policy. What made it worse is the security guard came and kept asking \"what's the dog for? What's the service?\" To which we all had to reply \"He's BLIND!\" 

The cherry on top was the service was terrible and they didn't even offer to comp my brother a drink, appetizer or dessert for the inconvenience, embarrassment or harassment!! Seriously?! ?

Shame on Southpoint for being so ignorant of ADA rights and for being blind towards a blind man! Apparently, their \"new policies\" include discrimination towards the blind. 

While the food is great, that kind of \"service\" is not acceptable! Mom and I will be looking for a new place for dinner from now on!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by just how good this place turned out.    I had eaten here once previously for sushi, and it certainly fit the bill.   On my last trip, I was craving seafood, but too tired after a long flight to search around and elected to eat in the hotel.     I had the Dynamite Green Mussels and the Miso Black Cod, both of which were fabulous!    Their wines by the glass selection was limited, but had a very nice sauvignon blanc that went great with both of these choices.    Service was vey attentive without being overly obtrusive, and fast.     I loved this so much, it will be on my agenda once again this week, and a permanent addition to the rounds for every trip (I am in LV about 6 times a year on business)."}
{"text":"Zenshin was an unexpected stop due to a cancellation of my flight, but everything happens for a reason. The restaurant is located in the Southpoint hotel which is off the strip. The staff were very polite and friendly. Honestly after a canceled flight and transferring hotels I was starving. I was looking forward to the pork Belly buns that were pictured here on Yelp but unfortunately are no longer on the menu and have been replaced with hotdogs? Considering that they actually have a hot dog stand in the hotel casino I thought this was bad move, but I'm just a foodie passing through :) 
However they do serve sushi! I decided to get two rolls one being the spicy tuna roll and unfortunately I can't recall the other roll, they were ok, nothing special but price appropriate. I also got a bowl of ramen which tasted like it was from the package. This particular bowl had pork Belly and hard boiled egg in it however it tasted old and the bowl overall just kinda bland. The atmosphere was nice, they played great music and I left with a full tummy. All in all I give a 3."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here and I must say, everything from the service to the food was superb! We were immediately seated, food + drinks arrived pretty fast, and the staff were very attentive! You MUST get the Strawberry Bangkok for starters! Tonkatsu Ramen was great too as well as all sushi platters!"}
{"text":"Kapono my server at the sushi bar was awesome!  Smiling face, on top of everything!  

Goat cheese & Pear Salad A+ & an absolute must have every time.  

Rainbow Roll in a Philadelphia Roll, instead of California Roll, not wrapped so tight & was falling apart. 

Katsu Chicken not so good.  Fried chicken on rice, onions & eel sauce, nothing special.  

The hot sake was awesome tho!  Love that salad!"}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour! Ordered a cocktail, beer, two orders of sushi (eight rolls in each order), and edamame all for under $20. Server forgot our 2nd beer but otherwise service was very fast. Food was excellent."}
{"text":"Zenshin asian restaurant (JAPANESE) is located inside of the South Point casino next to Steak and shake. I ordered the fried noodles with vegetables for takeout ($10) add $2 for chicken or $4 for shrimp Japanese-style fried noodles with onions carrots green onions bonito flakes and pickled ginger. The dish was very tasty with good texture not overcooked but after a while was salty and not consistent. Would've loved to give these folks a 4 star but due to the saltiness and three glasses of cold water after my meal I decided to give them 3 star! The folks where friendly taking my order quick and fast! YES I would go back because... I give many places a second chance even after three stars next time I will order but request little or no salt!"}
{"text":"Back at Zenshin again and totally enjoyed my meal once again the sushi was excellent as usual. Always a good just a fun experience"}
{"text":"Planning for a trip to Las Vegas we had to add sushi to our list. Zenshin had some mouth watering photos up on IG so we decided to check it out and I'm am soooo glad we did. Coming from Oahu, Hawaii.. Everyplace in AZ butchers the ahi or grounds it up so we were ecstatic to find their Hawaiian Style Spicy Ahi"}
{"text":"Went here after attending the movies.  Not my first visit but this one did not go well,  food wise.  The service was great and so was the Vegetable Spring rolls.  The teriyaki chicken pizza was very oily and over cooked.  The waitress asked me about it and I told her that it was a bit greasy and she apologized,  no problem.   A few minutes later  a manager was passing by and asked me the same question and he got the same reply from me.  His response was quite different from the waitress.   He looked at me like I had just said \"nice suit\".  He just walked away with a smile.  Nice customer service.  Don't know what I was expecting but not that.  My sister will be staying at Southpoint next week so I will let her know what to expect."}
{"text":"Yummy and inexpensive! My 2 favorite things! Happy hour makes me super happy, the service I should add was great. All smiles, prompt and helpful.
I'll b back!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about every dish we ordered. 3 of us stopped in during happy hour. We weren't aware it was happy hour. We ate several delicious dishes for $65.  I didn't think it was possible to have so many explosive flavors in my mouth at one time. I couldn't stop eating because each dish was just as delightful as the previous dish. Service was great and with a smile.  I will eat here again. I'm excited to try other dishes and revisit what I ate tonight. Get the eggplant fries!!!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic last night. Angel was an incredible server and so personable. We took advantage of happy hour and had four rolls, appetizer and dessert."}
{"text":"I love it here. It's one of my favorite happy hours for food in town! 

It's never too busy so getting a seat within 20 minutes is definitely reasonable. 

My personal favorite roll during happy hour is the 777 roll. And for dessert, though it's not on the happy hour menu, is the fried banana lumpia!"}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday night happy hour, was seated immediately and greeted immediately. Happy menu was awesome, rolls were okay but the appetizers were delicious! Someone came over to let us know one of the items we ordered would take a little longer, working in a restaurant I definitely appreciated that. We were asked by the manager how we were doing as he table touched. The entire experience was pleasant. Great service and good food for a decent price! Rory was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"We came here out of recommendation from one of my coworkers. In her defense she had been drinking when she came here for a late night eat 
We were here during happy hour and  ordered off the happy hour menu along with the regular menu. 

The stir fry veggies were very over cooked and drowning in sauce. One piece of baby Bok Chou that was cut in half alongside non descript over cooked veggies that were drowning in sauce. 

The Japanese noodles had an Indian type twist which was interesting. 

The lettuce wraps were boring.  

The garlic fried chicken was fried perfectly. We paid an up charge for breast meat. The garlic sauce was almost non existent. I could barely taste the sauce and had no sense of garlic at all. 

Maybe if I had been drunk like my friend who recommended this place I would have liked the food."}
{"text":"Best short ribs in town! Paired with kim chee fried rice yum! Nice fresh salad & miso soup was complimentary. Sashimi platter was amazing, really fresh. Eggplant fries were tasty too! Definitely a gem hidden inside a hotel casino. Just wish I didnt have to walk through a smoke infested casino to eat such fresh food!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Deals, Good Food, Nice Atmosphere, definitely recommend this restaurant to hang out for happy hour"}
{"text":"Definitely go during happy hour! Limited menu but great prices and everything we had was delicious. The service was quick and friendly. We never had to wait for a drink refill and food was brought out as it was finished so everything was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise! We were staying next door to the South Point and were in the mood for sushi and decided it'd be easiest to go here, not expecting it to be that amazing! Fast service, great food, not terribly priced! We had the ultimate shrimp roll which was OUTSTANDING, as were all of our bowls. The hot tea was a little bit different than what we are used to, but had a great flavor! We will definitely be returning here and highly recommend it to any sushi lovers out there!"}
{"text":"A while back I reviewed this restaurant, and just went there for lunch today with my friend Keith. As always, the food is so fresh and delicious. I had the Asian Pear and Goat Cheese salad, and Keith had the Poke Salad and a sushi roll (not sure what it was). All were beautifully displayed, and tasted amazing. As always, the service is impeccable and prompt. Very romantic for dinner, and a bit lighter for lunch. If you are looking for a modern style Japanese restaurant with super fresh and beautiful food, try this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  Really understaff. Server doesn't know his own menu.  Can't handle a table of 10+1. Food coming out was super slow. Our first time and will be our last time.  Here a kicker. Private room require 10 people.  We were 10 then idiot host stated that we have to spend a 1,000 in the room.  Wtf"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour with a group of people. We were sat at a large table directly outside the kitchen. So with all the kitchen noise & the loud music it was hard to hear each other. Service was fairly slow. Items on the happy hour menu seem to be the cheaper fried items or spicy. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with this happy hour. Had higher hopes for it."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from the hostesses to the Director of Operations. It was my first time to the casino to see the Oscar nominated films. Between films I wanted to get on my iPad. I learned that Zenshin has access to WiFi. I asked if I could stand by the restaurant to get on my iPad. The hostesses graciously invited me to sit in the waiting room and use it. One hour later as I was getting ready to leave, the Director of Operations came by to offer me a glass of water. If I did not have dietary restrictions, I would definitely have eaten there. I appreciate their generosity and thoughtfulness in customer service."}
{"text":"Serviceable. Service was slow. Server \"niced\" us to death. Very reasonable happy hour menu. The Garlic chx was quite dry. Great onion rings. My sushi rolls were Midland."}
{"text":"Wife and I were staying at Grandview and came here for the happy hour. Staff was great and the sushi rolls were great."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, open late, great price point, amazing garlic edamame! And strangely you may find the best Arnold palmers here! Gotta try it out"}
{"text":"Delicious Sushi!!! Everytime I have eaten at Zenshin, it has always been on point. The garlic edimame beans and Terriyaki chicken bites are fya!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"They have a good menu for happy hour! There was no wait to get seated around 10p and our service was fast and awesome."}
{"text":"While at the South Point checking out the Glass & Bead Expo, I wanted to grab a quick lunch. I noticed the sign for Zenshin and it clicked that I had seen this under recently open businesses on Yelp. I made my way to the menu and was surprised at how extensive it is...they had anything from sushi to ramen on the menu. The prices seemed reasonable and they had bento boxes and lunch specials. I opted to give this place a try.

SERVICE: This is their weak point. Our server was nice, but not really on the ball. He was not well informed on the menu nor the drinks that they offer. When I received my bento box I had asked what the pickled vegetable was...he walked around asking three different people until he found out it was squash. Perhaps it was busy, or they're still working out the kinks, but this is their main area for improvement right now.

FOOD: Reasonably priced and delicious. The fish was fresh, the roll options vast and unique. They had several lunch specials and I really enjoyed my bento box. I had couple of classic rolls such as cucumber roll and california which were priced accordingly between $5-6 per roll. I had one speciality roll Tuna Mango Passion and that was $13. Their speciality rolls were between $10 - 13. I generally don't like fruit on food that is suppose to be savory, but this roll was very well executed. I opted for the Salmon Teriyaki bento box. It came with miso soup, salad, steamed rice, pickled squash, and a generous piece of salmon in light teriyaki sauce. This was a great deal for $11.

AMBIANCE: This is an open restaurant inside of a casino. It is definitely noisy. The decor is very sleek and modern, and the restaurant is spacious so personal space even at the sushi bar isn't an issue."}
{"text":"Great spot anytime I'm stating at the South Point. For lunch the half pound wagyu beef burger is excellent. Great quality, cooked to order - hard to believe one of my favorite burgers is under $10 bucks and it's not at a burger place. I like that they change up the Happy Hour menu from 2-6 p.m. so there's always something new to try and that they keep my favorite sushi rolls on it. I always get the 777 and crunchy roll. The bbq chicken pizza is also good. Friendly staff and sushi chef's. Have brought several groups of friends here and everyone has been able to find something they like."}
{"text":"I was just leaving the theater at South Point when I came across Zenshin. I had already bookmarked the restaurant on Yelp as a place to try and I noticed it was happy hour (2pm to 6pm daily), so I figured I was meant to eat here.

The decor was Asian inspired and everything looked clean and organized. 

The hostess led me to the bar and offered me the happy hour menus. For drinks, I ordered a water and a strawberry bangkok (strawberry colada - patron silver, malibu coconut, fresh sweet n sour, fresh muddled strawberries with a thai chili pepper inside) which were brought out to me quickly. The sushi chef behind the counter took my order of teriyaki beef slider (thinly sliced beef, asian slaw & spicy miso sauce), hoisin pork belly with bao buns (pickled vegetables, green onions & cilantro), and a crunch roll (shrimp tempura, crab, avocado roll, topped with crunchies & eel sauce).

I enjoyed the strawberry bangkok drink and the crunch sushi roll was delicious. I had to force myself to slow down and not inhale the roll. I enjoyed the teriyaki beef slider more than the bao buns. The bao buns weren't terrible at all, they were okay. Just not my style.

Both the food and service during happy hour were a joy to me, especially after the terrible happy hour I received at another place, so I definitely want to come back to Zenshin. Heck, I even want to come back here when it's not happy hour, that's how much I liked it."}
{"text":"The  food  is excellent, and staff is friendly. I try to come here when we are in Vegas. My sister  works there  and makes  the desserts."}
{"text":"Love this sushi bar! Wonderful fresh seafood selections! Awesome service!"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour is from 2-6pm and the menu dedicated for Happy Hour has one side drinks under $6 and the other side appetizers, sushi rolls and pizza..average price is $5. I saw Karage Chicken, Salmon Poke, California Rolls included in HH menu.  I ordered the pork belly bao buns which were really good! The bun was soft, the pork belly was a little too crisp though. 3 appetizer sized came in a fancy platter. Unfortunately my phone had low bat so no foodporn for this review.
 
The menu I was given was primarily sushi and a few beef/chicken bowl options. I didn't see any bento boxes as my choice. Come to find out later that is only on the dinner menu?  So I ended up with eggplant fries and the beef teri as my entree since I don't really care for sushi...(yeah I know blasphemy)
 
The Eggplant fries: YAY!....  The Teriyaki bowl: NAY! ... I really like these fries!!  Veggies dipped and fried in a light tempura batter and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. For sure I would order this again. Very good!  The Teri bowl though, not so much. The sliced beef pieces I had was a little dry and tough and the teriyaki sauce was too thick and salty for me.

Location: Inside South Point Casino next to Steak N Shake. You can either sit at the sushi bar or the tables and booths surrounding it. There is also another dining room but it was not being used at the time.
  
Service: Staff is still lacking in finesse department. Service started out fine but after I got served my entree, I didn't see my server till I got my check. Granted he had to cover a lot of tables in his area, it was not that busy in my opinion.  I needed silverware and couldn't get his attention at all so after a few minutes went by I had get up and ask someone else. I don't expect to be waited on hand and foot but a little acknowledgement can go a long way you know? 

Hopefully the kinks will get worked out cause I really would like to come back and try more items on that Happy Hour menu. That Lychee Martini sounds good."}
{"text":"Since being on a sushi kick lately I decided to grab a happy hour drink and sushi roll at Zenshin.  It's located inside South Point casino and is close to the house.  I tried the fried oysters and California roll.  They were excellent and at $9 for both it was a great deal!  My only regret was not ordering the lychee martini and getting saki instead.  The saki was good but that martini looked better.  Oh well gives me a reason to come back and SOON!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding! Portions were above average and delicious flavors in every dish. 
Just a little loud if you were looking for an intimate dinner or time. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a great Asian joint! The service was superb. Our server (Rory) was very attentive, accommodating and knowledgable about the menu/wine list. He had a nice personality and was courteous without being overbearing. 


The food was tremendously better than expected. I ordered a tempura roll, with the chicken teriyaki entree and my boo ordered the hibachi salmon. Both entrees included miso soup (which I don't like in general), but our server was able to give me an extra serving of salad, instead of miso soup. The salad was exceptionally fresh! Although I'm a sushi virgin, the tempura roll was delicious ;-)  My teriyaki chicken was fresh and cooked to perfection. The chicken wasn't dry, like most dishes. Although I did not taste the salmon, it looked very appealing! The presentation of the dishes was admirable..

I left feeling full, but not heavy...like I usually feel after eating...especially when the good is good. Lol. The food was light, healthy and FRESH!

I will definitely eat here again. Please note, this hidden gym is located inside of the Southpointe Casino."}
{"text":"Food was decent but overall my experience was pretty bad. My friends and I went there for happy hour. We had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated. They never apologized for the wait or reassured us that they will help us soon. The hostess even seemed unsure about the situation when we asked how long we had to wait. It wasn't even busy. My friend was on a time crunch so we were hoping we could eat together for a little bit and she could leave. The wait lessened our time and my friend told the waitress she had to leave soon so she wanted her food to go. The waitress said she couldn't do that and explained that they couldn't let her bring it to go because people take advantage of the cheap price. But my friend didn't have time because of the wait and had only ordered one roll to go which is not taking advantage of the prices They messed up her order also which made her have even less time to eat. Our waitress only came back to us once when we asked for the checks. The only person who was friendly and made it a better experience was the guy who cleared our table and filled our waters.

I ordered the crunch roll which is okay compared to other sushi restaurants. The furakake salmon poke was good but would not be worth the price if it wasn't happy hour prices. I tried other restaurants that serve the same items that are better and aren't even Japanese restaurants. 

I would give the food another chance just because I can't judge the quality based on my 2 items I tried but hope the service wouldn't be as terrible as what I experienced."}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi and sashimi when I tried (2014).  The only thing I don't like is, as any restaurant inside a hotel, it's a bit on the pricy side. But the quality of raw fish I thought was excellent."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely courteous, friendly, and even though the wait was 45 minutes, i thought that a good sign for a restaurant. The prices were decent and the specialty drinks were really fun. However, I was a little disappointed in the food quality. My mother ordered the beef rice bowl which was essentially two vegetables and a mound of extremely sweet rice with kind of chewy beef. I ordered the Wagyu hamburger special, which was delicious and worth the price, but the beef I was served seemed almost imitation, and was spongy like a tofu substitute. I will say though that the eggplant fries were phenomenal and the rest of the burger, including the house made bun, was on point. Just wish the meat in both our meals was a little better quality.  Admittedly I had never ordered this type of beef before, but I'm pretty sure beef shouldn't be spongy. I should have stuck with sushi, which from what I could see looked amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  The food was amazing.  Bronson, the manager was great at making sure the customer experience was amazing.  Jane our server was very prompt and suggested delicious menu items.  I would recommend this place to anyone that is craving great sushi or Asian food."}
{"text":"Delicious me and my friend came here for lunch and was definitely worth the stop to walk in Thur the casino 5 star review for me"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!!!  The sushi rolls are phenomenal!!!  Try the Baked Alaskan!!!  Our waitress was very friendly and kept our drinks topped off.  High quality food at an affordable price!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for two consecutive nights! The best crunch roll!! Their oxtail soup was so delish too!!! Yummmmmm!! My grandparents loved it! My husband and i used to go to downtown LV just to eat  oxtail soup but on August this year we found this place and loved their oxtail soup! The wait is not long as compared to that place where we used to go to (Market Street Cafe).

I will definitely come and eat here again the next time i come to Vegas! I will definitely recommend this place to my family and friends too!!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  Service was excellent.  Prices were average for a good sushi dinner."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience while visiting this place. The prices are high. But I guess that's normal for a good sushi place. The restaurant was clean and has a good setting. It wasn't busy when we were there. Our service was great and our server Rory always checked up on us. Thanks for the great service and food."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very good food. I was promptly seated and treated as if I was the only person in the restaurant. The entire staff was very nice and patient when asked any questions about the menu. Will definitely visit the next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty good. Friendly staff,  but bad service during non - happy hour time. 2 tables were only being served (including our's), but it seems that our server is you busy chit-chatting with other waiters. Ordered Spider roll, not as what I expected from the reviews. Oxtail soup what ok, bland. Can't go wrong with mango mochi, just well presented in a plate. Also, we didn't know we are 10 minutes before happy hour until I heard the other party next to our table. The waitress gave them an option if they're ordering for happy hour, they can wait for a couple of minutes.  That's our waitress,  but she never gave us that option. Anyway, if you have time to drive a few minutes for a great Oxtail soup, I'll go to California Hotel & Casino instead."}
{"text":"my first time ever having sushi. Got the  friendliest waitor. And I'd love to come back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service skills from a gal named Azure. I asked her 3 times regarding seating and she gave me the same mono-toned answer to another question....like a programmed robot. Well, I put that aside and got seated by her at the worse possible seating. Though many booths were available, she put me and my wife at the sushi bar right next to the kitchen door on the end with my seat having no table space for the stack of menus which apparently are there normally. She had a smirk on her face which didn't help. We had a mind to walk out, but timing was upon us as we had pre-purchased movie tickets and needed to eat. So, a fantastic view of folks cooking and washing dishes, not to mention the extra ambiance of kitchen noise. Only good thing about this section was Jesse our server who was great and also two other staff members, even one who looked like the owner or manager in a nice suit came and filled my glass when it was empty. So that made for very good impressions on us. Regarding food, we are from San Francisco (right by the ocean), so we may be what some might consider \"sushi snobs\".....(this being the Nevada dessert), and the portions were rather small and flavor only passable. Too much cucumber in the California Roll, (SF restaurants have only avocado as the veggie, along with the crab and nori......never cucumber....filler?) Again, all our rolls were about 70% the size of what we get back home. After eating we made sure Jesse got a nice tip, and we ended our meal. Now just to make sure I got her name, I said a pleasantry to Miss Azure on the way out so I could see her name tag.......true to form, she half smiled and did not say a word...... So......I will recommend this place for a quick sushi fix but ONLY on Miss Azure's days off from work......not kidding, she really doesn't understand how to talk (or not talk) to customers....too bad she is in a service business. She easily ruined our meal experience with very poor customer service skills. Seriously, does anyone know if there is an opening at the DMV where she can apply for a position? It would be a perfect fit for her.....no lie."}
{"text":"I ordered dessert (ice cream) & when I went to eat it the dessert was soggy and melted. I know I know I ordered ice cream to go at a restaurant but in my defense I stayed in hotel vicinity. We ordered and they gave it a 15 minute wait. Now my common sense tells me u bring it out of the freezer or prep it at that 12-15 min mark but anyways, we showed up waited just a minute to get helped, the hostess told us our food would be just a few minutes. No problem u guys are busy we can see BUT as time went we noticed there was a box of food behind the counter and we got to thinking I wonder if it is ours. Sure enough it was and she had no idea. Then she checked the bag told us I have to get your dessert excuse me. We waited as she asked around, my coworker says I bet $20 it was in the bag the whole time. Well I'm glad I didn't shake on it. It was in the bag and not only in the bag but the first thing placed in the bag. Sooooo not only did u not communicate about our food but u put ICE CREAM at the bottom of a hot food bag... Who does that. I called and got a refund and they were very accommodating asking if I wanted a new dessert I declined but was happy with their accommodations. All my coworkers love it there and we're pleased with their meals."}
{"text":"Awesome!! The wait was not long at all and the staff was very friendly and helpful. First time here and the prices are really reasonable. My husband and I both had the Teryaki Chicken bowl with steamed rice and veggies, Miso soup and Pepsi and Tea. Very filling and the flavors were out of this world. My husband got sweet tea by accident and sent it back and the server was very apologetic and willing to make it right. My husband said no thank you water was fine. When we got our bill the server took that Tea off our bill. We will be back and to venture in trying the different kind of rolls they make onsite."}
{"text":"Cool modern place.  The sushi was above average and very fresh and can stand on its own.  Fresh.  If I couldn't tell by the taste, I seen them wheeling it in air tight bags on ice during lunch.  I think the strengths that put this place over the top are the non-sushi items:

The black cod was crispy, flaked off the fork, was not dry at all.  In fact it is very succulent with zero \"fish\" taste.

Pork belly was totally fantastic.  Just get it is all I can say--find room for it, share it, whatever...  just try it.

The servers are good and an enjoyable bunch.  They definitely know their menu if you are not sure about something and are having trouble deciding.  They will tell you details and have had stuff on the menu themselves.

I am no paid food critic--but I am not some schlub who stuffs his gullet and has no concept of what is going on.  I'm pretty surprised with 1-3 star reviews but notice they tend to be closer to when the place opened so maybe the restaurant was working through some things at their opening."}
{"text":"Its a bit of a drive for me but im always down to check out new spots especially to support the local hawaii community out here in vegas. The menu here was very good and its hard to find good japanese food out here besides sushi and this place has it! The pork belly was amazing and so was the ramen i had. If your in the area of south point hotel this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem within the South Point casino. 

Went for a sushi lunch one day and we were able t get there during happy hour specials, which had a list of great drinks and sushi rolls. 

I started with the tuna sashimi - which i LOVED. It was so tasty and had an awesome sauce. 

Additionally - I recommend the Apple Whisky Mojito - delicious! And the spicy tuna roll. 
A must visit if you ever find yourself at the South Point casino. Much better option than the Steak n Shake next door."}
{"text":"Go during happy hour (2pm-6pm)! Karaage chicken (3/5) and fried oyster (3/5) is okay. I like the sushi!! Better and cheaper than Ra Sushi. I like the Crunch Roll (4/5), and Spider Roll (5/5). 777 Roll (3.75/5) is good. The Pork Belly Bao Bun (5/5) is great. Service is great. Park in the back of South Point. It's next to Steak and Shake. We'll go back again."}
{"text":"Not bad. Wait time was 15 minutes but it's Vegas, better wait time than the other restaurants. The people working were nice. Food is fresh and worth the amount paid. Fairly priced. Would go again! My mother loved the hot tea."}
{"text":"One of my new favorites! The food is great; we've been there twice and service was awesome both times. Prices are also very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food.

I had the miso ramen, my husband loved his oxtail curry. We also had a mango tuna roll (?) which was delish - the fish was really fresh. A bit too much garlic on the chili garlic edamame, but that was good as well.

The restaurant is a lot larger than it looks from the outside and is really nice inside. It looks like they have a private room. 

Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're having a party, this is the place to have your venue.  Michael has done an awesome job to accommodate our wedding venue from start to finish. All the appetizers, sushi and entrees that we ordered were so delicious. Book your reservations here for your venue. You'll be ecstatic with their service and quality food."}
{"text":"Aliscia was so AMAZING last night and so was the food we had to come back night 2 for the service.. thank YOU ALISCIA for making special night you were AMAZING I really do wish wish you worked tonight"}
{"text":"I was very optimistic to go back here because now this place has been opened for a while (not like our first time here, it was during their grand opening). We went and try their late night happy hour and was VERY disappointed. We got 2 rolls of 777, 2 rolls of spicy tuna, and 1 of the Philadelphia. The tuna didn't look fresh (see pic), as you can tell by the color of the fish itself (not bright red but very pale). 
The 777 roll was supposedly spicy soft shell crab but again (please see pic), the majority of the filling was fake crab/kani and not the soft shell crab. The small amount of crab that it was in there was mushy and not have the texture of freshly fried crab. 

Quality was very low for a nice restaurant inside a (busy) casino. And I have to agree with my husband, people will check the restaurant out usually during happy hour. If they actually reduce the quality during happy hour, people are just not going to come back. Just saying.... (IMHO)"}
{"text":"Both the food and service were outstanding as usual! My hostess Andrea was very polite and friendly, as well as the waitstaff. 

I went for a light lunch and got the Unagi Roll and Hamachi Kama (yellowtail collar). So good! I will definitely revisit again!"}
{"text":"Super Vegan-Friendly!! The sushi chef, Chris, was very accommodating and truly went above and beyond to make delicious rolls for me!! Their Mocato is delicious!! I also like their Seaweed salad much better than my favorite sushi place. Great job Zenshin!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. I'm a fan of all you can eat sushi. They don't offer that here, however, happy hour was great, offering $4 rolls. So can't beat that. Sat at the bar area and saw Chef Aaron preparing sushi. He does such a great job and you can see he has great passion for creating sushi for everyone, great job! Service was fast and the staff was very polite."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  The atmosphere is mellow, the service is quick and the quality of their sushi is better than most places. I was pleasantly suprised to discover their happy hour selections as well. One of my top sushi restaurants for sure."}
{"text":"The best customer service I've had at a Japanese Restaurant! My server was from Waipahu where I graduated...and showed big time Aloha! Thankyou zenshin for the awesome food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Yelp Accuracy


I see that this place already has a four star rating. I would have to agree. I've had dinner here many times. From the miso black cod to the 007 roll to sea weed salad and even a cocktail.

The rolls are good and there are plenty to choose from. And the cod has been both excellent and not good. But fish is a delicate dish so let's call the few misses victims of circumstance. 

They are always very friendly and accommodating. And with all the menu options, I dare say even those who aren't down with sushi, will be able to find something they are happy to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered mini malasadas and sashimi... I was told by the server that the sashimi comes with 12 pieces and mine came with 5... wow!  I'm glad it was a free meal but seriously, the staff needs to know what they're talking about."}
{"text":"We were staying at South Point for a few days and had been leaving the casino to go out to places I knew in Vegas. On the one night we wanted some Asian food but did not know what was nearby. I decided to take a chance with Zenshin and was pleasantly surprised. 

We got the teriyaki beef and the teriyaki chicken with the baked California rolls. It was fantastic from the service to the decor to the food. You will not be disappointed except that if you are staying at SP that they have no fridge or microwave in your room for leftovers!"}
{"text":"Tried Zhenshin's special signature entree the chicken Katsu, and BBQ Kalbi beef short ribs and it was good too. Vegetableappetizer and miso soup is also included. I love the baked lasagna rolls is soo yummy! Worth every dollar!!! Love the ambiance of the place and very welcoming staff!"}
{"text":"Small rolls, hefty prices, good fish, and slow service.

I stay at South Point every year, and I was happy to see a sushi place open up.  It's not very busy yet, so we were able to sit down fairly quickly, but that's the last time anything happened in a timely fashion.   Everyone we talked to had pretty much the same thing to say, \"It's not my favorite place for sushi (which is XXXX), but it's here.\"

The menu: It's got a good selection of sushi rolls and nigiri... but not much else.  Very little in the soup and noodles section, and for those who like a lot of tastes, there's only the 2 combinations... one sushi, one sashimi.

The food: The fish was certainly as fresh as you can get in Las Vegas.  The tako with the cucumber salad was just excellent.  The special rolls are small, especially for 12-14 bucks a pop.   Go somewhere else for your teri-bowl, too.. it was teri-ble.

The service: Here's where they really need some work.  The staff was friendly, but didn't seem to know much about how long things take.   We sat down, ordered inside 15 minutes or so, then proceeded to wait.  20 minutes later my wife's teriyaki beef bowl arrived.  15 minutes later her cucumber salad \"appetizer\" arrived.  15 minutes later my two special rolls arrived.   50 minutes from order to arrival... with no warning from the staff except apologies as it kept taking longer and longer... shows a complete lack of interest in setting expectations with the customer.

Another example of the same.  My wife doesn't eat sushi, so she asked about the teri-bowls.  \"They're both great!\" the waitress says, so we order the beef bowl.  It comes, but is very fatty and the meat was tough to chew, which we then mentioned to the waitress.  \"I do like the chicken better,\" she then adds.  Well, where was THAT when we were ordering?!

Finally, we ask for the check... which doesn't have the comps we mentioned both in line and at the time of ordering.  So we wait again for her to come back with a modified check... which only has one of the two comps on it.. again mentioned before.   I walk up to the register to get it fixed, and have the remainder billed to the room, which the cashier does without giving me a chance to tip.   Total time from first check to walking out... 10 minutes.

Will the place get better?  I have to assume so.  They're starting from a good food and presentation base, but it's pretty obvious they've got some kinks in the preparation line, as well as some staff to train better."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!  Runs everyday from 2pm-6pm.

We got there about 5pm and were seated immediately. Didn't get our waiter's name but he was an Asian guy with a bigger build and he was very attentive. Never did we sit around and wait for him to come and take our order, refill our waters, or get our check.

What we got:
777 roll, $6. Spicy soft shell crab inside, with spicy tuna outside topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce. Gotta say I was expecting more like a spider roll as far as texture. Couldn't really tell it was soft shell crab. And with all the \"spicy\" in the description, it wasn't that spicy. 3/5

Hamachi kama (Yellowtail collar) w ponzu $5
They were out of the salmon collar so the waiter recommended this. It was actually really good and had a good amount of meat on it. The skin was nice and crisp, but make sure you eat it fast! 5/5

Fried oysters $5
Three pieces panko coated served with Yuzu aioli and tonkatsu sauce. Loved this as well! The oysters were very silky and still had a nice oyster taste. Some fried oysters I've had were overcooked till they fried the snot out of them.  I couldn't tell the aioli was yuzu flavored though. 4.5/5

Hoisin Pork Belly Bao $5
Served with pickled radishes. I was expecting actual pork belly slices. This was more like pulled pork. Also the Hoisin was very sweet to me. I preferred to use the tonkatsu sauce instead. 3/5

Including tax and tip, the two of us for this light meal was $27. Not too bad. Usually Happy Hours end up costing us at least $40 and then does not feel like a deal at all.  Even if we got drinks, we still would have gotten in under $40. Will def return!"}
{"text":"It took 40 minutes to get our sushi. Not even the pre-course side salad had been served yet. We were pretty patient, but we lost it when the table next to us who was seated 20 minutes after my group got their orders before us. On top of that, no one cleared our plates... standard sushi procedure. Three servers passed our stack of plates by. Our server was not remorseful, instead he gave us attitude when we asked for our bills. We spoke to a manager to report the service and the answer we got was basically \"tough luck\"

Don't waste your evening here. There are too many good places to choose from."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful and the staff was very friendly. We ordered the teriyaki steak and it was tasty. The salad dressing was also very addictive."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! I don't recommend this place at all!! Save your money and go to an all you can eat sushi bar!!! If I could I would give this place 0 stars!!! YUCK!!!!! 6 pieces of sashimi for $15?!?!?! you can go to YAMA SUSHI and pay 23.99 for ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!! I got the tonkatsu and had to even ask for rice, WTF?!? The miso soup wasn't even hot and the salad tasted like it had sand in it!!!! THIS PLACE WILL NOT LAST FOR SURE [BIG THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS RESTAURANT]"}
{"text":"Had no idea there was a sushi restaurant inside the south point. It's in the back corner so it is a bit hidden. Enjoyed a nice ladies night dinner here a few nights ago. 

I guess after going to so many other sushi restaurants and of course AYCE ones I'm a bit spoiled. Nonetheless, the sushi here wasn't bad. I don't think it was amongst the freshest I have had but it did the job in satisfying my sushi craving. 

The service was good. Our server was attentive and friendly, he seemed a bit timid at first but soon enough relaxed. He did recommend a few items which we did try and I'll admit they were good suggestions. 

Might stop by again if I'm in the Southpoint."}
{"text":"I wish I would have paid the extra $15 to Uber to an actual Japanese fusion restaurant... where to begin.. their mixed drinks are good. 

But the food.. first of all... the Thai Shrimp Cevice.. it was 6 pieces of small frozen shrimp in a plastic martini glass with Mai Ploy sweet chili sauce and sprouts sprinkled on top with two orange slices and stale chips. And the waitress even said it was really good, that's the atrocious part. No tomatoes as listed in the ceviche as well, not even any onion as it is normally made regardless of regional variation, so how was that ceviche at all? For $6 I could have assembled that on my own from a quick trip to walmart. Second.. the takoyaki... adequate amounts of sauce but there was medium sized rubbery chunks of octo in the dumpling.... not minced or diced at all so it was an unpleasant surprise to say the least. Third, the tofu was.... flavorless... even though it was in a cute broth. The broth lacked any flavor and I ended up having to put soy sauce *cringe* on the cubes of tofu... extremely displeased with how this food turned out, everything screams lazy or uninformed about how the items should actually be made. 

Customer service was decent at best. The food came out quickly and the drinks were good. Can't expect too much from a casino restaurant but for the prices they should actually make the menu items as listed and not a sad imitation. Was not worth $30 happy hour prices. And the servings are small (HH given). Wish I had never spent my money here. If you have never had any Japanese (fusion) food or think California rolls are bomb then this is the spot for you because it'll be just fine. If you actually know what you are eating then buyer beware. Will only be returning for HH drinks."}
{"text":"Zenshin looks like Island Sushi. It is! The same owners just opened another local location same style sushi, traditional japanese, and local food. The name you would never know but they do tell you on the menu the Chef same guy. I always been fan of Island Sushi. I been too both locations one on eastern and downtown. One thing diversifies this location is much more upscale feel too it. The sushi bar area is easily biggest one of the three. It has very modern current look too it. Overall never know upscale because the prices are very reasonable most of the items are under $10. There is no real dress code seen braddahs going casual shorts and tank top action. The portion sizes are good size goes along with the local style food. It just opened so you could tell that the wait staff still working out the kinks. Overall say the service was great! Some of the sushi took little longer but still got everything that we order. 

The food I ordered the torq fever sushi roll (spicy tuna roll) the presentation was beautiful. The taste was solid spicy tuna roll. I had the tonkatsu ramen. I know why ordering ramen if not the big three. I was in the mood for ramen. It was another solid dish. The broth was Ono! It was filling with all the toppings. Lucky enough that got too try some of my friends dishes. I tried the gyoza, softshell crab, sashimi platter, and eggplant fries. All tasty stuff. The presentations on all the food was really nice definitely for the price thinking something off. It all on point. 

It great addition too South Point Hotel. Hotel that always felt lacking in diversity comes too restaurants. Zenshin not only great sushi and local food. Another part of Vegas and find some comfort local food 808 style!!!! Sure I plan on going back if ever in the area need too get my local food! =)))))"}
{"text":"This place really threw me off today!! I was taking my nephew to the movies and we had an hour to kill, so we decided to grab a quick bite to eat. As we approached the restaurant there was a waiting list for a place that had 12 empty seats with 3 booths open. This made no sense at all!!! I get they were trying to build a hype so it could catch other people attention. But this was so inconvient for customers that normally come to this place!!!! The owner or management should definitely think this stratagy over!!!?? This was a horrible customer experience!!!! What is this a night club!?!? Come on now!?!?"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi lover. This restaurant had great sushi. Plus, the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was modern. I highly suggest the Baked Alaskan - I usually skip over rolls without cream cheese but this one was worth giving that up. The only reason I give 4/5 stars is because the service needs a little help, not sure if they were understaffed both times I went or if it was normal. I visited on a busier Sunday night and a slower Thursday night. Both were the same type of service."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour specials on rolls and drinks. I come here often and the service is always really great. The managers are also very friendly. The only reason I give it 4 out of five because nothing beats fresh sushi that is close to the ocean ;)"}
{"text":"First time here and was excited to try from hearing that it was voted best happy hour in Vegas. We came 3pm one Monday. The service was slow for the place not being busy at all. The strawberry Bangkok drink was really good along with the yellowtail collar. Nothing stood out for me, tasted like an Americanized sushi bar. I've had fresher fish elsewhere and the rolls were lacking flavor. My boyfriend really liked the Cajun pizza, their dough was great. We spent about $80 and I still was not full or satisfied."}
{"text":"Two stars is a little harsh but our experience wasn't pleasant.  

We had a large party of 8 and they didn't seem too busy but the service from start to finish was so bad.  After placing our order it took about 20 minutes for food to begin to arrive.  The California rolls arrived first and D said they were really good. About 5 minutes later a soup and a salad arrived and they were basic. About 10 minutes later everything else arrived.  About 10 minutes later a dinner salad arrived.  

Most had teriyaki, chicken rice bowls that were fine not great.  While we were waiting 20 minutes for the check and discussing how average the food was and how untimely the service was someone from the kitchen brought another dinner salad after we had finished dinner.

Summary: maybe a smaller group that stuck to sushi would be better?  I'll never know."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here with some friends for dinner. This resto is located at South Point Casino near the South premium outlets. We had the following:

777 roll $14

Salmon Skin Salad $8

Spicy Tuna and Crispy Rice $12

Garlic Chicken Bowl $11

Oxtail Curry $17

Creme Brûlée $6

So why i'm I giving this place 3 stars? Well, the salmon in the salad tasted brunt. The bottom of the crispy rice also was burnt. The 777 roll was pretty good. Their garlic chicken was nicely fried and was probably the closet thing to mitsu-ken's garlic chicken in Hawaii.  The oxtail curry was delicious! I liked the pickled and fried potato strings that came with it. I thought their creme brûlée was the best looking dish of the night and it was good. If it wasn't for the burnt dishes, I would give this place 5 stars. We will try this place again during happy hour..."}
{"text":"Good japanese food. They had one or 2 vegan options. 

Most of my group got the teriaki chicken bowls, which they liked.

The  service was good too.

It was a bit pricier than a regular japanese place but it is inside a casino so you pay for that."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night and it was a pretty active night.  Not packed but most tables full.  We were seated quickly and served our drinks pretty quick.  The service was pretty good and prompt and drink refills were attended to as well as periodic check ups on how we were doing.  I had the miso soup ramen and the pork tonkatsu.  miso soup ramen was just the right amount of salty you'd expecct from miso soup.  I thought the corn was out of place in  such a yummy dish.  I ordered some Hamachi sushi and it was a nice belly piece and tasted fresh from the ocean.  I also had some tempura fried California rolls and that was the right mix of crunch.  These guys do it right.  I'd go again.  Maybe next time I will sit at the sushi bar.  Oh, the pork tonkatsu bowl was standard fare.  Nothing different from your typical Japanese/Local Hawaiian food shops around."}
{"text":"Servings were too small.. Pricey yet not that very tasty..
We ordered a to go but waited too long.. Worst of all, not great customer service although there were only a few people they needed to serve..
The staff did not even offered us a place to sit while we wait.. They said they will call the name we gave them when our order is ready.. 30 minutes has passed still no name was called so i asked my husband to ask what is taking too long and they said the order has been ready but they didn't get it from the kitchen..
1 star since i can't rate a zero star! :("}
{"text":"I've always thought that your host/hostess is a business' first impression.  Zenshin's hostess, Tara, should rethink her job choice.  My husband took me out to celebrate my birthday at Zenshin on Monday, Memorial Day.  When we got there we had to put our name on a list and were told it was a fifteen minute wait because they were cleaning tables.  Tara took my name and phone number and said it would be 15 minutes, maybe sooner.  So we walked around SouthPoint for a bit to find some lucky machines.  About 15 minutes later when I didn't receive a phone call I walked over to the hostess desk and noticed that she was seating people who had arrived after we did.  So I walked up to the podium to take a look at the list and saw names crossed out below ours.  I asked what was going on and all she said was, \"oh sorry, your table is ready\".  As we were walking toward the table I told her, we requested a booth.  She completely ignored me and put the menus on the table and walked away.  I decided I wasn't going to let her ruin my celebration.  Granted, the food is fantastic and our waitress was friendly and attentive.  While we were having lunch we noticed that a gentleman with a walker was waiting to be seated.  Tara, grabs a menu and walks over to the sushi bar and realized she couldn't seat him there and there wasn't a table ready.  She says to him, wait a few minutes while they get a table ready and just leaves him standing there and walks back to the podium.  Really? Is that how you treat customers?  What appalling treatment.  Love the food, but your hostess has to go.  She's going to tank your business.  What a shame."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is excellent, the service was very good. We ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl, lasagna roll, and shrimp fried rice. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I had the chili garlic edamame and a rainbow roll both were really good! Price wasn't to bad. Service was great. I will be back"}
{"text":"The pricing to portion is RIDICULOUS here. This is a complete rip off for what I paid for. I ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl with a miso soup and spent $11. Wow!! Never again will I order from here"}
{"text":"Amazing.   That is all,  amazing food,  excellent service.  We stopped in for a quick lunch and we're pleasantly surprised.  We started out with the calimari appetizer which was amazingly seasoned.  I had the teriyaki  salmon bento box and the flavors were outstanding.  My son had the Ramen and my husband had the oxtail soup and were both happy and full."}
{"text":"This place was an unexpected delight. It was our first time at the hotel and we were looking for some dinner choices. A few of the restaurants were closed on Tuesday night. There were 5 of us and one of the wives is a pretty fussy eater. We were not sure if Asian food was going to work.

We checked out the menu at the desk before we decided to try this place. The service was excellent and the food was wonderful. We did mostly rolls and the gals had chicken teriyaki. All in all I would say this is a place I would definitely like to get to know better.

We will return soon!"}
{"text":"Located in south point casino - really nice place with better prices than other Japanese restaurants. Server Rory was great & when he was busy with other tables the rest of the staff made sure to check on me and bring out food. Drinks are good, I recommend the Caribbean Cosmo! The portion size for entrees are big and filling and their creme brûlée was the best! If you come with more than 2 people I would call and make a reservation first. 

Check in for 10% off. The total for 2 drinks, meal, & dessert was $45."}
{"text":"Zenshin offers a great variety of sushi, sashimi, and entrees on their menu.  The seafood is always fresh and Lisa is a great server!  We are loyal patrons to Zenshin and is always on the top of our list for sushi night. Great job!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I have ever had dinner. Everything was perfect! The ox tail soup and the uni were fantastic as well as the drinks and the other rolls. The service is a bit slow with the food, but the wait staff is fantastic and full of advice to help with choices! Will return before I leave Las Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden in the South Point Hotel, this restaurant is really good. The service is great. They have good happy hour specials too. If you are there for lunch, try the Po-Boy soft shell crab sandwich. It's delicious! It comes with eggplant fries or sweet potato fries. I had the eggplant fries. I was here for a conference and ate here almost every day."}
{"text":"Food is pretty ok. Service is on point. I order individual rolls include the happy hour rolls and still came out pretty pricey. The creme brûlée was good tho.(one extra star for it )"}
{"text":"A strange experience.

Were seated right away. Took 10 minutes before someone would take our order. Once they did, service was excellent, food was quick and very tasty. We then ordered dessert and that took another 15 minutes, the server even went back to check twice on what the delay was. Odd considering there were more workers than patrons in the place.

Overall, the ambiance and food were great, we managed to get there during happy hour so that was a nice surprise and the server even gave me the happy hour price for a nom happy hour roll. Was even pleasantly surprised to get a 10% off coupon during checkin.

Would definitely go back, just hoping the service would be a bit more consistent then."}
{"text":"Very good rolls at great size and they come out fairly quickly if the bar isn't to busy. Hidden little treasure in the South Point Casino."}
{"text":"I ordered the House Sashimi and it was delicious.   The yellowtail was excellent and my favorite.  My only complaint was the portion size.  For $17 one extra piece of Yellowtail, Salmon, Tuna would have been better (it came with 3 of each, 9 pieces total).

I don't recommend the calamari.   It's coated in something sweet and it's not very good in my opinion.

Service was fine,  in fact we received our sashimi before our salad and calamari which wasn't ideal but not a big deal.

I might go back just to satisfy my craving for sashimi but not as often as I would like due to the portion size for the cost."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Daily 2-6pm, Sun-Thu 9-11pm, Fri-Sat 10pm-1am

Happy hour specials are $4.50 beer, $6 wine, $7 cocktails.  $3-$8 food specials.

Came in for afternoon happy hour.  Got off to a bit of a rocky start.  They asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or a table.  We said first available then waited over 20 min for them to sit us at the bar that was vacant the whole time.  Once inside we could see there were several open tables as well.  I understand restaurants need to stagger tables.  20 min seemed a bit much.  Maybe I just needed a drink.  Lol.  You can make reservations for happy hour so I will definitely do that next time.  

We started with a Melona Breeze and Coronarita.  Second round was Caribbean Cosmo and Carpe Diem.  Drinks were yummy.  For food we chose Chicken teriyaki pizza, 777, crunch and spider rolls.  Everything but the spider roll came out quick.  Sushi tasted great.  I don't usually think of pizza when going to sushi but the chicken teriyaki pizza was really good too.  We thought they forgot the spider roll.  We were pretty full so didn't mind as long as we weren't charged.  If ended up coming out after we were done with our other food.  Not sure if that was by design.  Food, drinks and value make up for the few minor hiccups.  Zenshin will be in my happy hour rotation."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Worked well because I love sushi but my daughter is still learning... The beef teriyaki bowl and huge, enough for 2 and so yummy. The sushi was fresh and the rolls quite tasty. The staff was helpful, friendly and accommodating. We walked in at 7 on a Thurs night and seated quickly. Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here with Anthony and Sarah-Marie. We try to fit a \"sibling\" meal in at least monthly to catch up; trying out the latest spot @ South Point was a great idea. I'm trying desperately here not to hold it up against my favorite neighborhood Sushi-Ya, because it is a fusion/Hawai'i style location. Never having been to Island Sushi put me at a loss as to what to expect. 

Speaking of lost, holy heck, this place might as well be in CA. The car park was INSANE. I was cursing like a sailor on the phone with SM trying to find a spot for 15+ minutes. Do yourself a favor & go to Self Park. 

Normally, I'd be sitting at the sushi bar, but SM & Anthony procured a table in dining room to right. Kind of glad because the sushi bar area was open to Casino and it was packed Friday night. It is brand spanking new, which showed in decor and some service hiccups (they ran out of menus? So our server had to take away the one we wanted to keep: no biggie, but since we order family style, we might have ordered more with a chance to really peruse it as we munched and gabbed)

We had the Eggplant \"fries\" deceptively light for a deep fried item and the batter was airy, like tempura. We also shared the Ahi Poke Tacos (x2 orders) which were very good, with high quality tuna, guacamole and creme fraiche. The Hamachi Sashimi with jalapeño over truffle oil & yuzu was indulgent. We turned at least 4 over zealous bussers away because we wanted to keep that oil for the House Sashimi Sampler and the Salmon Carpaccio. I did not taste the Dynamite Mussels, but I'm picky about mussels. The fish was fresh enough, cut and presented well. It just wasn't that \"flown in last night, killed in front of you\" quality I've become accustomed to. We all really enjoyed the salmon skin salad: on a bed of super fresh micro greens with a light delicious dressing. The only ding was that the slices of salmon skin were very inconsistent in their cuts, with most being on the thin side. 

There were choices for any palate on the menu, so carnivores, ramen lovers, local Ono style and bowl folks alike should walk away satisfied. My Belvedere with a side of soda (I'm super picky and usually mix it myself: former bartender problems) was only $6. You read that right. So clearly, marking up premium vodka is not an issue here! 

In all, this is a great spot to grab \"Asian\" food in this part of town. On a funny note: I was lost and asked SP employee where the new restaurant was and rolled my eyes when she said \"Oh, the Asian place...\" and very kindly pointed me there. Then I walk up and see a giant honking sign proclaiming \"Asian Restaurant\" so I was getting all non politically correct riled up over nada. 3.5 stars rounded up because it shows promise. And ALL of these delicious dishes were just 30$ each+ tip (split 3 ways which is our style) extremely affordable!

{"text":"I'm a fan of their happy hour. It's everyday from 2pm-6pm.  I posted a picture of the happy hour menu, so you can visualize what you might like.

I came in on a weekday, around 4-5pm.  It wasn't busy, thankfully, because I was starving.  I sat myself down at the sushi bar, and the bartender quickly came by, greeted me, and got my drink and app order down.  I ordered a refreshing cucumber cocktail ($5)... it had a fancy shamncy name, but I forget what it was called.  It was a part of the happy hour cocktail menu, however, so it's easy to find.  For food, I ordered the chili edamame, furikake salmon poke, and spider roll.  Everything was good; delightful for a happy hour.  I also ordered an Asahi, $2 draft.  Will definitely be back to try the other happy hour items!"}
{"text":"Its not easy finding a great Japanese restaurant with:
-Great service
    (water refills on deck)
-happy employees
    (always smiling)
-Instant Greeting
   (greet right when you walk in)
-Nice setting
-Great food choices

Came here during happy hour 2-6pm

Ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl and A Crunch Roll.

Ahi =$12
Crunch Roll= $5 (happy hour)

No regrets.
Im coming back to try their food.

GREAT SERVICE :)"}
{"text":"I like it here. When I'm craving some katsu or some spicy tuna, I'll come here. Pretty cheap. My hubby enjoys this place."}
{"text":"Ate there twice last week while in town.  One night was at happy hour and one regular dinner

Had California Roll, Shrimp Tempura, Fried Pork Tenderloin bowl, fried oysters.

Everything was good.  Service was fast and good."}
{"text":"Awesome food & excellent service. Ordered the miso ramen w/ pork belly absolutely delicious & the oxtail soup was so good loaded with meat. The ahi poke was so fresh. Too full to order the sushi but it was highly recommended by friends. My favorite restaurant at South Point with the best service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here late last night for the final meal of our Vegas weekend. 

I am surprised that such a wonderful sushi restaurant is at South Point. It really is as good as sushi place that I have been to in Vegas or back home in Los Angeles. Just to sweeten the deal, it's inexpensive. Ridiculously inexpensive.

We shared the sushi sampler, an extra order of CA Rolls and had alcoholic drinks...and left stuffed for around forty dollars. The fish was fresh and the soy sauce is house made. It was really delicious.

The staff was extremely personable, with both our server and sushi chef chatting with us and making sure that we were happy. I felt like we were getting a lot of personal attention, like being a regular at a favorite bar. 

Zenshin was good enough that I am sure on future trips, we would make the effort to drive over, even if we were staying on the Strip."}
{"text":"Extremely fresh sushi. The taste was amazing. My wife got the chicken teriyaki bowl which was exceptional. The chicken had a wonderful grilled teriyaki flavor. Service was prompt and extremely friendly and helpful. Highly recommend for an awesome experience. (This restaurant is in the South Point Hotel / Casino.)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the service was really good. The 777 and the sunrise were great. The avocado was perfectly cut on top and both rolls had really well blended and smooth flavors. The only reason not get 5 stars is that besides sashimi, no specialty options without rice."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good.  An interesting menu! I've tried the soups twice and haven't been a fan so not sure. Sushi OK."}
{"text":"First meal we had in Vegas after flying 5 hours from the east coast. Food was excellent and the service was spectacular. I definitely  recommend the Oxtail Curry!!"}
{"text":"*** Update! This was a 3, but I bumped it up, see why below. ***

I Was excited to try Zenshin. Nice atmosphere. (I agree the elevator music is cheesy, but I think it's coming from the casino.) The service was good and friendly.

I had the $5 lunch crunch roll which was yummy and well-portioned. I made the mistake of ordering the shogun burger (who orders a burger at a sushi place?, never again). The eggplant fries were really good. The burger had redeeming qualities, but it didn't appeal to me. I ate 2 bites and left 90% of it on the plate. I mentioned this, but no compensation was offered. *** update! Before I gumshoes my review, the server took the burger off my check, and still gave me the 10% yelp check in discount. ****

Conclusion: The crunch roll, service, my love for sushi, and other yelp reviews mean that I will have lunch here again while I am at the South Point Resort this week. I'll stick with traditional fare and let you know how it goes!"}
{"text":"Friends were raving about the prix fixe menu for 2 for $40.  Four of us went and ordered two of these menus, and the choices were quite varied.  Upon request, they served us both the Miso Soup and the Salad for starters.  I had the Lobster Tempura for my entree and the Young Coconut Bread Pudding for dessert.  Although I really could not taste the lobster, I thought the presentation was good and the portion was generous.  I thought it would have been better if the batter were not so thick.  The Bread Pudding was more like a hard cake cut into squares, I thought it was just okay.  I tasted the mackerel entree that my friend ordered, this was a simple dish, ample serving, and well prepared!  I also tasted the Banana Foster Lumpia, very creative and yummy!  The service was attentive and responsive to our requests. I would come back here and bring more friends!"}
{"text":"Prices are a bit steep, but service is wonderful. I'd come back more often if I could have a bill less than $60. I got a few specialty rolls, and they were delicious!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is great sushi! Sake sampler was great. We tried 4 sushi rolls. Spider roll, 8 second bull ride, California roll, spicy tuna tempura, and desert was banana foster...was awesome! Lisa the server was just as good. Prompt and professional...I recommend them!!"}
{"text":"This dining Experience took place last night after 10 PM on 6/14/2014

As a food lover, I enjoy most foods out there.  Sometimes the food can be good to fantastic, but the service is not the best.  When a mismatch like this happens,  I really have to write about it.  

My friends an I came to the Southpoint Hotel for a Health Convention, we decided that we should come here, since we were here last time and the Chicken Curry Katsu was pretty good.  So we came, had to wait 20 minutes because there were a lot of people.  So we thought wow, must be pretty good like last year.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.

The 6 of us, missing 1 because he was busy winning at the slot machine, looked over the menu and decided we were going to eat light tonight.  Good thing for Happy Hour.  I ordered a Spider Roll and 777 Roll, my friends ordered a Beef Teriyaki, Chicken Katsu Curry and Beef Fried Noodles \"Japanese Style\" w/ Fried Egg.

For me the rolls were excellent in both taste, texture and presentation.  I would give it a 4/5 for the rolls.  My other friend who got her Fried Noodles was not impressed at all.  The fried egg was a sad looking overcooked, extra oily flat ovoid, that was begging to be part of a high school cafeteria unhealthy meal.  This was sitting on top of oily thick egg noodles and thinly sliced beef that was overly marinated with sauce.  To make a long story short she could not stomach it and had to bring it home.  The other 2 friends were way too tired and hungry to care much about the food.

After, finishing, or not wanting to finish the food, we waited for the wait staff to return.  Thinking that it would not take long for the pricing and atmosphere, we were sadly mistaken.  At 20 minutes of wait time, I tried to wave somebody down to get the check, but he said that our waiter will be with us.  After waiting another 10 minutes and my friends asking how come we can't get a waiter,  I decided that I needed to be proactive.  Going to the front, explaining how long we have been waiting, the ladies, said they will look for our waiter.  One came back with the printed check.  The worst part of this communication transaction, was that they did not even apologize have out waiter come to give us the check and apologize for the long wait.  Bad customer service trickles down from the top.  I have been at less attractive meal locations and had the best customer service, to a mediocre meal.

After paying our meal in cash, so we can hit our beds quicker,  we realized something.  They totally forgot the Miso soup that  was suppose to come with the Beef Teriyaki and the Chicken Curry Katsu.  This prompted me to write this review.  I can only say this, like the shadow economy the past year, along with oil,  Service has gone down, way down.  If you are desperate and don't mind to wait and waste your sleep time, by all means this is perfect for you.  If not, invest your time and dining experience elsewhere.  The Customer Service is a 1.5/5.  If you need recommendations for food in Vegas let me know,  I can help.  There is life after bad service.  Take care."}
{"text":"First time here and LOVEDDD it!! From the food to the experience to the set up..everything perfect! Food: hamachi sashimi soooo ono and rich, the hamachi kama was huge and cooked perfectly and the spider role was one of the best! The experience: local vibe. Coming from hawaii had local people working so was very welcoming and comfortable to eat. The set up: loved the floor, the sushi bar, the subtle little design pieces around..sooo welcoming and just relaxing! Totally be back..good thing I live 5 mins down the road!! And my #1 sushi recommendation!"}
{"text":"The happy hour deals are amazing. You get a great amount of delicious food for a good deal. I highly recommend the 777 roll and the lettuce wraps. Nice ambience and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were at Southpoint Hotel and Casino for their Discount Tuesday at the movie theaters, where the movies are only $5 (amazing deal by the way) and we wanted to catch the 9:35pm showing of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it was sold out and so was the 10:20pm, so we chose the 10:55pm one. Anyhow, we got our tickets and wanted a place to eat. Because we've never been here before, we decided to try it. And OMG, so glad that we did. The service was great. It was quick and the atmosphere, setting, mood was sooo nice that it really made my boyfriend and I forget that we were in a casino. It just really felt like a restaurant to us. We wanted a table where we could sit next to each other, but we chose the sushi bar instead because we didn't wanna cause the trouble of the hostess moving tables around and stuff for us. We didn't interact too much with the waiter or the sushi chefs, but when we did, they were so kind and totally recommended us to come back for their happy hour. The food was also really good. My boyfriend got the beef teriyaki and I got the chicken stir-fried noodles and it was not what we expected at all. It was more than what we expected. We thought it was just gonna be a mediocre type of place, but the price is totally reasonable for the food. Awesome experience! We will definitely be coming back here. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Oh wow!!! Ok so I don't even know how to start this review except Rory is the best server!!! No seriously we know nothing about sushi at all!!! He helped us pick out some cocktails and came back to find out we were clueless. Poor guy! Lol. Ok so here's the deal I do not like fish at all. Only sea food I like is shrimp and sometimes a little bit of crab. He pointed out the cooked shrimp rolls. Honestly we tried almost all three!! Skip the garlic shrimp there isn't any garlic flavor really. But the crunchy roll and the deep fried California roll are the best. So yummy!!! 

Rory kept coming over to check on us. So nice and we kept ordering something else lol. Next was the chicken katsu meal. Scott had the miso soup that came with it, we shared the salad and then shared the rice and katsu.  Really good!!! Everything we ordered he could eat because there wasn't any corn in it!!! Yay!!!! I had the island drink and he got the plum wine special. He liked them all except for the one with honey. Two managers came to our table to check on us. Such good service and they give you 10% off with the check in offer!!! Our bill was $65 for all that food!!!!

Next time he comes back to town we will head over here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. Took out some sushi for my mom who is extremely allergic to shellfish and the server who took my order told me not to worry. So I ordered unagi with avocado,  garlic albacore, and salmon rolls. Again, not exceptional but, for the price, not bad either. Miso soup way too salty. Nice atmosphere in a large restaurant on way south Eastern. I may have to give them another try."}
{"text":"Sushi is very good, fried oysters were excellent, happy hour rules!  $3 coronas, $5 fried oysters, $4 California rolls, great place to unwind."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise. Looking for a nicer restaurant, and wasn't expecting it in the South Point Casino. The teriyaki chicken was good, flavorful, but missing some grilling - needed maybe a bit more for nice crunch. The salmon appeared to be very good.

Creme brulee was very good. Loved the nice touch of the sugar netting over the dish.
The yuzu-orange semifreddo was also very tasty.

All in all, nice place, nice servers, nice environment, nice desserts - the entrees could maybe use a little work - they're good, just not the best.

Oh yeah - Yelp check-in was silly. It was a High Five. What was it? Waiter didn't know, had to ask manager - oh yeah, it was a \"high five\" - no food, no discount. Silly."}
{"text":"Honestly the regular Japanese food here wasn't super special, I only ordered a teriyaki bowl and I guess you can't do much with that anyway; but the staff is incredible, super attentive and so nice, the restaurant is beautiful and the dessert is KILLLLLLER. Definitely get the pineapple upside-down cake (it is served warm with ice cream!)"}
{"text":"My favorite local sushi spot! So so so good, and the service was excellent. The manager even came over and greeted our table."}
{"text":"Zenshin has it all! Chef Rex, Chris, and Jason are the best! And Jessie ... the mixologist extraordinaire is amazing!"}
{"text":"Well, what can I say about this place other than it's close to my resort and my family wanted Asian food which we got. Surprisingly the food was pretty good for Asian fusion food. The waygu burger was good, they overcooked it, but it still had nice flavor but hey it's waygu so it's going to be good anyway.  The hot dogs are good, get the happy hour one, pork belly skewer was very goodWe also ordered the oxtail tostada which didn't taste like oxtail at all, it was shredded meat could have been pork meat but ultimately haf no glavor. The family had edamame, spring rolls, and a teriyaki bowl which were just okay. Eggplant fries are good, my wife liked them once she put soy on them. The fries also needed salt. It's only okay. Would come back only if we had to."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Try the 8 second roll.  Sadly it was full of loud drunken douche bags while we were there which sort of ruined the mood.  The table next to us - full of adults - was screaming and catcalling and whistling, clearly disturbing other guests, and management did nothing about it.  

But the food was fine so they would've had 4 stars if they controlled the aholes better."}
{"text":"I've got to be honest I was extremely surprised when our waiter cut me off mid order to take someone else's check. On top of that the specials were awful. The meat on my Korean BBQ short ribs was so tough I couldn't eat it with anything but my bare hands. My fiancés ribs tasted a few days old and were still cold. Don't even bother the waiter who couldn't take time to check on the patrons. Now for high prices and small portions you should expect quality. Not what we received. The best part was the drinks which numbed the pain of feeling ripped off. Sixty dollar one course meal..."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour! 2-6Pm. And always friendly service. Never had a bad experience. Love love love the spider roll and fried oysters. And $6 drinks!"}
{"text":"We came in around 11ish since Steak n Shake had a long line. We ordered 3 miso ramen, 1 spicy salmon roll, and 1 007 roll. The first thing we got was the spicy salmon roll which was my favorite food of the day. It had a hint of spice and the sauce had soaked a little in the rice making it yummy. Then our ramens came. I have had miso and tonkatsu ramen before in other restaurants. What we got looked and tasted like tonkatsu due to its white color and creamy like texture. We still ate it since its ramen. It tasted like normal ramen...nothing special in particular. Afterwards we got our 007 which looks and tastes like a capterpillar roll. So all in all..our experience was so so. Spent close to $80."}
{"text":"Absolutely love going to this restaurant. Food is awesome. Desserts are epic!!! 

Ask to be seated in Christine's section. She's the best server ever!!! Top notch service and super friendly."}
{"text":"Happy Hour from 2-6pm!

Mom and I went on a Monday evening (prior to seeing White Christmas at the Cinemark upstairs.)

We got there around 5:40pm and still had 20 minutes left on the HH menu!  
And what's great is that the HH menu is available in the regular dining area.
SCORE!

So... we had $3 Asahi draft beers, veggie pizza (more like a flatbread that was surprisingly good), potstickers, sweet thai chili chicken and a chicken garlic bowl.
Both chicken dishes were great.  I was surprised.  I figured it was just ... ya know... plain chicken with sauce... nope... both were juicy and had wonderful flavor.
I think we liked the sweet thai chili chicken the best.  It had the whole sweet / hot thing going on.

Service was nice, and the food came out as it was ready... not all at once which really worked for us so that we could nibble here and there.

Since it was Monday... it wasn't crowded. I bet on the weekends it is tho.

We will be back... especially for HH!"}
{"text":"Despite being in a random hotel off the strip, the food was outstanding.  The miso glazed pork belly, crispy spicy tuna and garlic edamame appetizers were on point. 

As far as entrees, the ultimate shrimp and tuna fever were great. As a sushi snob from ny/nj this place gets two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This little sushi place in the South Pointe Casino is extremely good.  I don't know why others say this place is expensive. This place is very reasonable; I would know bc I'm Japanese and eat out to Japanese restaurants all the time. Their quality of fish is much higher than the kind served up at an all-u-can-eat. Obviously noob yelpers can't tell the difference. This place also has delicious fried eggplant fries with a garlic mayo. Soo good. Oh yeah, and their California rolls are one of the best I've had. It was literally a perfect balance of fake crab, rice and veggies/avocado!  Highly recommend for a quick, delicious meal.  I only found it because my family wanted to find a casino that had bingo lol."}
{"text":"Service was great. Booked party reservation for 8 and were surprised to get a private room. Service was excellent and staff were friendly. Food was great!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for non ayce sushi, best quality for the best price! But I will only go if Sushi Chef Chris is working. Don't forget to ask for him. He makes mouthwatering custom off the menu dishes."}
{"text":"I really like the servers here, but the management sucks. They have all of these promos and coupons with all of these dumb exceptions. Happy Hour is a joke...it's still a la carte ordering and you're paying by the dish...and it's not like it's $1 or $2...but you're not allowed to take the leftovers with you! Seriously!?

The servers continually apologize for their rude managers. You almost want to reduce the servers from this hellhole. 

The crab sliders were awful...not even real crab meat; they should at least tell people what it is.

Truly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Conveniently located inside SouthPoint Casino and Resort. It was easy and fast to be seated but service took a long time. Sat for about 15 minutes before being acknowledged. Order also took about 20 minutes. The restaurant wasn't even busy. When the food finally arrive, it was well presented but it wasn't great. Price was a little high for the quality of the sushi. All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. If you happen to be in the casino and just need a place to eat, this would be a good place to go if you want Japanese food in the wee hours of the morning."}
{"text":"Everything was great that we ordered.  Tempura appetizer, seaweed salad, 777 roll, salmon lover roll, unagi roll and dragon roll!  We made a reservation on yelp and got in before people waiting!  Also took advantage of 'check-in' to get 10% off.  Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Zenshin/Island Sushi & Grill catered our wedding Nov 2016. We were drawn to them because of the variety in their menu. From the very first taste tasting, we were blown away at the professionalism and quality of service provided! My spouse and I were coming in from out of state to have our wedding in Las Vegas and had many obstacles, especially finding the perfect caterer, but Zenshin made it an easy choice from the beginning.  The management was extremely personable and detailed in the services they provided. We never felt pressured into anything we did not want and they genuinely made us feel like we were their most valuable customers. Additionally, there was a vast variety of food on the menu, and every single thing we ordered was delicious! It was hard to narrow down the choices because we wanted everything on the menu after we experienced the taste tasting. On our wedding day, the caterers were all set up and ready to go at our venue when an hour before the wedding started we had to move the reception across town. Not only were they flexible, the rushed over to set up at the new location and their execution was FLAWLESS and they did not miss a beat! Everybody loved their food, especially their sushi and desserts! Zenshin saved the day and I would recommend this staff any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Great rolls. Unexpected as we were Grabbing a quick bite before a concert at the property. Great service too."}
{"text":"Nice spot! Service was great and the 8 second bull ride sushi roll was the best roll I ever had!"}
{"text":"Food: I've only come here during the Happy Hour and ordered from the HH menu. I've been here a couple of times now and was disappointed to see that their Eggplant Fries are no longer on the HH menu. It reminded me of Portobello Fries but more tender.  Although there wasn't much flavor to it, the dipping sauce complimented it well. These were probably my favorite on their HH food menu. I've had the Chili Garlic Edamame as well and I really liked the flavor here. It was a good amount of seasoning that really fought out the flavor of the edamame. We also had the Ahi Poke, which was really good, but I felt I could have fresher fish elsewhere. I really like the fact they have a number of sushi rolls on their HH menu, and what now looks like some kind of pizza. I probably will try one of these during my next visit. 

Environment/Ambiance: The restaurant itself is tucked in a small corner of the casino and is a bit small, with booths lining the walls and a large sushi bar in the middle. It's a very open area that's connected to the casino floor. It looks as though they may get a bit busy during their Happy Hour so sometimes there's a bit of a wait.

Service: During my first visit, I don't remember our server being negligent. During our second visit, our server was attentive...at first. But when she noticed that we were just ordering drinks (we had already eaten and were planning on eating later) we saw her less and less. She only checked on us once and that was just to see if we wanted a refill on our drinks. It came to the point where I honestly thought she had forgotten she was our server as she walked by us a number of times without even a glance our way. We were on a time crunch and we couldn't even flag her down to ask for the check.

Tips: They have great deals for the Happy Hour, which is every day from 2pm-6pm, but come early as it can get a bit busy."}
{"text":"Loved the miso soup and my tempura roll! The only thing that keeps me from giving this place five stars was the server that we had -- He was more interested in showing off his bottle opening skills than paying attention to our needs. I would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Salmon was dry, falling apart... not fresh. Tuna was bad too. Veggie Garden roll is great -- but that's not what you go to a sushi restaurant for."}
{"text":"My wife I went here for Valentine's day, and we were amazed by the hospitality and friendliness that we were greeted with. The food came out in a timely matter, and the presentation was awesome. They were quick to answer any questions that we had, and regularly checked on us to see if we needed anything. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Ok I received some food vouchers from the casino due to promotion so figured treat myself to something different. Ok during lunch was fantastic guess because it was slow but dinner time different story. I got a nice quiet booth in the corner  and we ordered  calamari apatizer  which is served with a nice aoli sauce. Mine was braised beef very tender but a bit on the small side for basically crock pot beef with bone. Served  with a fried rice that was done with flair well plated and good presentation. Our waitress was very nice but hostess  seated rowdy  people next to us.  No sense same age demographic should be seated near each other Lisa let us move, which helped but the bus boy kept pestering for my plates guess wanted us out. Ok so quality fantastic value not so much, seats and ambiance varies 3 our of 5 people were great hostess and busboy as I mentioned weren't"}
{"text":"So a friend treated me and others out with a $100 voucher and we were suppose to dine at 8pm but found out about their happy hour from 9-11! We had such an awesome server named Mochi and she sat us around 8:30pm. We ordered calamari and 4 shrimp tempura for starters. Then when 9 o'clock hit Mochi gave us the happy hour menu and we ordered one of EVERYTHING on the top. The garden pizza was demolished mostly by me with sriracha on the side. I didn't really dig the fried oysters just because Im used to eating them raw. Besides water our table had 2 merlots, a beer & a martini throughout our meal and ended with 4 green tea ice creams for dessert. We went over our voucher budget by ~$40 lol This place wasnt hard to find being located towards the back with a huge sign readig Zenshin. I love how the sushi chefs were always yelling their usual Irasshaimase greeting whenever a guest entered."}
{"text":"This restaurant is still awesome. The crunch rolls were so good I didn't even get to take a picture. The pizza was still excellent and so was the ramen. The noodles were firm and the broth was very seasoned. They had the biggest chunks of chasu pork I've ever seen! Most places give slivers but the meat was chunks of pork. Excellent!

The server was nice, the water was always filled, everything came out nice and quickly. I told the manager that we always have an excellent time coming here and how amazing the food always is. 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Definitely surprised by this spot in the South Point. While there are definitely some higher end sushi options in Las Vegas, this spot had good food, fast service and very reasonable prices. 

Sushi Mon may be a better bet if you're not casino bound, but you won't go wrong at Zenshin."}
{"text":"Excellent quality....great service. ... Chris takes care of you.... great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Best and biggest Poke bowl everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Omg I want it every single day. The rice was extra poke delicious too. Awesome service. The other roll I had was incredible as well, shrimp tempura inside and spicy yellowtail inside (chopped, not just yellowtail with a dab of sri racha) on top with jalapeño and cilantro. YUM! Greatest combination. I kind of wish I went back today.... dangit! So so so so good. I want to try many other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"This nice Asian restaurant inside of South Point Casino is a hidden gem. Their rib eye steak is to die for, and it's satisfying when you complement your meal with their awesome lychee martini! Their meat are soft, juicy and flavorful. In my opinion, it's one of the best steak I've ever had! 

Their staff are very nice and the place is family friendly."}
{"text":"The service is great, but the food is not.  The rolls that were ordered were fishy tasting without a lot of fish on them.  You may need a magnifying glass to see the fish.  For 4 rolls, an appetizer, a drink and two green teas, we spent $90, which was a total waste of money.  I left hungry, not wanting to spend another dollar in that place trying to find something I liked that actually tasted good.  I have eaten at other places not in a casino or on the strip and got better food, better tasting, bigger portions with less money.  I love sushi and eat it every time I can, but this visit was disgusting.  Even though the poki tacos were tasty, there was little fish on them.  I could have put all the fish on those tacos on a tablespoon.  We have even ordered  asian dishes in the cafe that were prepared in the asian restaurant that were equally as disgusting as this visit.  My son who loves asian food would not eat that dish.  Great service but the food isn't so wonderful.  I will never eat there again.  Save your money, go off-strip and find a better deal and better tasting food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Chicken karaage tasted like it was marinated in a sour sauce to hide the lack of freshness of the meat; agedashi tofu was very bland; fried oyster wasn't bad; 777 was overfilled with sweet eel sauce; seaweed salad was ok"}
{"text":"Not good. There are so many other delicious sushi spots to go to! Got a couple of rolls & baked mussels that were unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is EVERYTHING! I don't even know where to start. Always amazing service, and always a yummy meal! Their 777 roll is unlike any roll I've ever had. Zee best!"}
{"text":"While in Vegas with friends who are on strict gluten free and pescetarian diets, we ate sushi every day for four days. We found this gem tucked a mile or so off the strip. The menu prices were very competitively low compared to other restaurants in Vegas and the Happy Hour was even BETTER! I did not expect much from the food since the cost usually reflects the quality but I was very pleasantly surprised. The food was incredible and well worth a $25 cab ride from the Cosmopolitan. This sushi was better than any other sushi I got directly on the strip. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We're done with Zenshin. We are locals, live nearby and dine frequently at the various restaurants at South Point.

Second review of Zenshin: called to get a dinner res for tonite at 530, 3ppl..Kaitlyn or Kayla puts me on hold to see if that's doable..Almost 5 mins later she picks up and asks if she can help me. Told her I've been holding for you for almost 5 mins and yet she offers no apology, nothing. Just told her 'you know what? Don't even want to dine there now. And I hung up.

If we want sushi from now on, we'll head to Tides at Green Valley Ranch! Four extra miles but Great food and never have had a mishap with them."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant twice during this visit. Service was prompt, professional and pleasant in all respects.
Food and prices and Zenshin compare to upscale neighborhood sushi restaurants and the product is good quality.
I recommend trying the happy hour menu before 6 p.m. as it is excellent value. Of particular note, try the spider roll, thai shrimp and Ahi poki. All good and the price is right."}
{"text":"I went with mom after hearing about their happy hour menu. Their happy hour menu isn't too extensive, but there are enough things where you can get a varied amount of items still. 

I sat right at the bar with my mom and so the chef asked us directly what we wanted to eat. My mom told him what we wanted and he made it right away for us. Getting that experience right at the bar is always cool and it didn't get any less cool for us. The waitress took our order and got us our chicken lettuce wraps. Those were really good, the chicken tastes like it was cooked over an open fire and that is what made these taste so amazing. The rolls were average compared to a lot of the different places around Vegas where you can order sushi, but you can't be picky when it comes to happy hour, you get what you pay for, but I still enjoyed it a lot with my mom. The manager was personally walking around making sure everything was going great for all the guests and I really appreciate that gesture. I will definitely be coming back after having such a great experience here!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, first time was during Restaurant Week. We were really surprised to find a good but affordable Japanese-Asian fusion restaurant tucked away in South Point. Impressed with our first visit we came back. 

Do not miss the oxtail dumpling soup. The broth has a hint of \"Bulalo\" flavor, if you're Filipino (or enjoy  Filipino food), you'll know what I'm talking about. Must try the garlic shrimp, stuffed shiso with spicy tuna, grilled Scottish salmon and eggplant fries. They also have a wide selection of sushi rolls - the 8 Second Bull Ride stood out and lingers in gastronomic memory. Yum!

Also need to mention the service was excellent. You can make reservations through your Open Table app."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out before or after the movie! Happy hour daily 2pm - 6pm also reverse happy hour too. Friday-Saturday 10pm - 1am and Sunday -Thursday 9pm -11pm 

Recommend Thai sweet chili chicken bites and Hamachi Kama and lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here everytime we visit vegas the past couple years. They have some great happy hour prices! And their service has always been REALLY great! I got their spider roll...$6! ...after eating one, I just had to eat another."}
{"text":"We love their happy hr and been here three times this month so far. Our must haves are the chili garlic edamame, and eggplant fries. They are courteous and accommodating as we are on the keto diet ordered the tonkotsu ramen and wanted more broth and less noodles,no prob at all! Thanks guys, Zenshin is a fav for our fam bam"}
{"text":"Best happy hour near me!! I come here all the time and usually get a beer, a large hot sake and the 777 roll. The rolls are always on point but the appetizers are hit or miss. I've learned to avoid the tuna poke and seaweed salad. The poke tuna is always gray, off-colored and squishy, like they just barely defrosted it and threw it into a bowl. The seaweed salad is always dry so I've stopped ordering it. BUT I still love this place and the service is amazing!! Probably gonna come here for lunch today to be honest haha. Love you guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Happy hours is the best time to go. Food is great. I would give a 5 star but the last time I went, the hamachi was no good. It had a very foul smell."}
{"text":"Was voted happy hour in Vegas! Service was great and so was the food. You have to drive a bit from the strip to South Point, but it is totally worth it. Make sure you ask for Chris or Rex!

There is a good selection on whatever type of sushi or rolls and a variety on sake as well. Apparently, the bar in the lobby have $1 shots or drinks after 10pm? Didn't get a chance to check it out. 

Overall, definitely recommended. 10% off the bill if you check into Yelp!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, nigiri has two important components. The fresh fish, and the sushi rice. They've failed me on both today. The rice was extremely mushy. Way over cooked. It really reminded me of supermarket sushi. Don't ask me how I know. Sometimes when the craving hits, the craving hits. Lol.. 

Then the scallop had a weird taste. Not a fan. 

8 second bull ride Roll.. not worth the $16. The garnishes up top made it taste like dirty grass. The asparagus so mushy and soggy that I forgot it was even there, it just all mushed in together. Very disappointing. 

Would probably never try again. Not worth it.

Odd though since I'm a frequent visitor of Island Sushi & Grill, which is another one of their restaurants I guess? They have better sushi and food imo."}
{"text":"This is a happy hour review.

You know when you step up at 5PM on a Sunday and there is a wait, something great is about to happen.  Hub and I were informed without reservation could be up to 20 minutes.  We took first available seating and got seated only after 10 minutes.  We were attending the Dat Phan comedy show, so we had plenty of time.
Bartender (wish I caught his name) was super prompt.  We ordered 2 Asahi draft beers for 2 dollars....super ice cold.
I ordered the 777 roll for six dollars...it was a big roll!  Hubby ordered the teriyaki sliders.  I think he expected they would be on Bao buns due to some of the reviews on here, but he still liked them quite a bit with a spicy slaw.
We ordered a spicy garlic edamame.  Hub has never had, and after begging him to finally try, I almost had to slap his hands out of it.  He could not get enough.  The bill was so cheap and we had a voucher from southpoint to pay and also payed remainder with points.  Bartender once again was quick with the whole transaction and was able to keep other customers happy too.  This is a must return!"}
{"text":"They have the best happy hour! I love their spicy edamame and the garlic chicken bowl. Every time I  come the staff is always overly nice and helpful, I love it! I would highly recommend. Even being in a casino, it's fast and easy to get to."}
{"text":"Decided to try them out for lunch time. We were seated and services quickly! Our server was very nice along with the people delivering our food. Their menu consisted of Japanese and Hawaiian fusion. I decided on the Shotgun Waygu Burger (not sure if I got the spelling right) on the lunch special with Parmesan eggplant fries! I wasn't even able to take a picture because the food looked too good and I inhaled it right away. I unfortunately didn't do it enough justice. Sorry guys! Let me tell you I don't normally eat burgers unless they are an Asian fusion, but I ate everything! It was amazing and a must try. It also came with onion rings. We tried their crunch roll on the lunch special and it was delicious. I usually get special rolls but the taste was on point! They were very accommodating with the little one when I'd ask for little things like extra cucumbers for her etc. They even gave us another miso soup for whatever reason was wrong with the first that I didn't notice. Lastly the dessert was as equally impressive with presentation and taste! 
Our server frequently checked up on us and the manager was even able to stop by our table to greet us. 
Overall the service was on point and the ambience which I forgot to mention was soothing. We will definitely come back here to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi! The only thing I wish this place had was all you can eat. Most sushi places has the smallest serving for dessert. Not this place! I ordered the creme brûlée for dessert and it was massive and delicious! Great service too!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Zenshin again on our last trip to Vegas on 8/2. We had a party of 9 and couldn't get a reservation via Yelp. But I called and told them we were coming down and wanted to get a table. They made sure we would have a table that accommodated all of us by the time that we got there 30 minutes later with no wait. Our server was very nice and attentive, making sure that the food for the kids came out first as they were both starting to get \"hangry.\" I ordered one of the specials which had the teriyaki salmon collar, miso soup, salad, rice, and came with a glass of wine (which someone else drank cause I don't drink).

Just like our last trip, the food was fantastic and very flavorful. The shishito peppers I ordered for my appetizer was really good, but kind of wish they were spicy. Not complaining though! Over all, great service, great food, very accommodating staff. Will for sure come back again!"}
{"text":"Best sushi on this side of town. I don't eat carbs and asked for Blazing Tuna roll wrapped in cucumber. I attached a picture. Tasted amazing. 

Service at bar was excellent. Very attentive and did not let the empty plates stack up. I'll definitely come again."}
{"text":"The food here was really delicious and I was actually quite surprised. It was a little dead when we walked up and  everyone seemed to be waiting in line at the burger joint so I was concerned that it was due to the quality of the food that everyone already knew about. I was hesitant to try it even when we made the decision because there is nothing worse than bad Asian food. We wanted healthy and not grease so we took the plunge and I'm so glad we did. 
  

I had a bowl w/brown rice and my husband had a beef bowl w/brown rice as well both w/teriyaki  The  sauce they used was so good and mixed well with all ingredients to deliever a very fresh and hearty flavor. It wasn't too heavy and it was the perfect amount. Waitstaff was nice and did their job well. As we were leaving it started to pick up which made sense, we must have lucked out during a down time. If your staying at the hotel, don't hesitate to try it. Prices are very reasonable and they have sake and fresh sushi as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food and service are amazing. Happy hour is our favorite. Everything we have tried is so good. Every trip to Vegas we always have to go here a couple times. They are so attentive to the customer. Definitely recommend this spot. 5 star food and service.."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is awesome! This place is inside the south point which I love! Of the strip and less crazy! Zenshin is affordable and fresh! Definitely love this place. Staff is fast and attentive which is hard to find at most sushi bars. We had a few of the happy hour rolls and the happy hour menu is fairly large. Good selection of saki"}
{"text":"This place has great service but the food was only mediocre and definitely didn't warrant the price. Stars are for the service, probably could have gotten better Asian food at Panda Express."}
{"text":"This is an updated review from my previous post. Love the food and service here now. It seems like the restaurant really improved its customer service. Our server Janessa and our busser Jeremiah were great. They were very attentive and quick. My family and I had a very pleasant experience. 

Must have foods: triple 7 sushi, hamachi kama, and oxtail soup!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour specials for both drinks and food.

I always get the same thing: Hamachi Kama. It is so good. And for happy hour, it's even better.
I drink the monkey jacket, some sort of gin drink (I didn't even know I liked gin). It is so refreshing and tasty, it's all I order.

I've tried so other things, they were good but not memorable.

Hamachi Kama and monkey jacket....that's all you need to know. Oh, and go for happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Hawaii and when I seen they had poke tacos I had to try it out. I'm so glad I did because they were the bomb!!! You get 4 for $10 which is such a good deal! I am used to paying almost twice as much for 3. The poke was fresh and the toppings and won-ton shell were perfect. 

Bad: I LOVE shrimp tempura so I ordered the bowl with onions. The batter they use is very thick  and the shrimp was small. I like tempura done very light and crunchy, this was more heavy and oily. I didn't finish any of it after the first one.

I didn't get to try the sashimi, but I wish I had ordered that instead of the tempura. The creme brûlée is really good here as well. I would return just for the poke tacos and to try the oxtail soup."}
{"text":"I thought this place was fantastic. I went with 3 other people and we were seated in a large booth. The atmosphere was upscale but not froufrou or intimidating. The restaurant was busy but not noisy or crowded. 

We were recommended the oxtail curry which wasn't on the menu but were told it would be added to it in the near future. The oxtail was awesome! It was so tender and flavorful. We also started with the Dynamite Green Mussels...simply delicious!

As far as sushi, we had 5 different rolls: Cajun Albacore, 777, Candy Cane, Blazin Tuna, and Salmon Skin. All were good, but I think the 777 was my favorite. It's a spicy soft shell crab roll, topped with spicy tuna, spicy aioli and eel sauce. The Cajun Albacore sashimi was super good too. It has a great kick for those who like spicy.

I'm a BIG stickler about service and I must say the service here was great. The waiter was friendly and helpful and prompt. He checked in on us sevrel times and we didn't have to wait around for him to take care of the bill. 

Overall, my experience where was awesome and I cannot wait to eat here again. I will make it a point to go here the next time I'm in town."}

{"text":"Zenshin, advertised as an Asian restaurant, is a Japanese sushi bar located in a far corner of the South Point hotel. Upon entry, you're greeted by many enthusiastic hosts, and even the servers passing by will also welcome you. 

The interior is very minimal, which is the popular style in Japan, however, I found that the establishment might have some identity issues. 

As I first mentioned, Zenshin is advertised as Asian, but it's a majority Japanese. Their choice of decoration include the lucky new years cat, Buddha, and metal traditional Chinese garments, which are all things usually seen in a Chinese restaurant. There are a few things Japanese, such as the samurai chest piece, and the choice of wood on the sushi bar, but the vibe I got was more Chinese than Japanese. 

As for the staff, I found that they mainly left their tables to the more experienced staff members, while the younger staff remained at the host stand and the cashier stand. The waiters seemed to have worked there for a long time from their thorough understanding of the menu. I asked one of the host for the name of the roll that I was just given and she was unsure, which left me to believe that maybe everyone who goes into training start off as a host. 

The server that I had was very knowledgeable and when I asked for recommendations, it was very comforting finding out that he didn't point to the most expensive dish on the menu, which is usually the norm of many restaurants. 

I ended up getting the miso soup, gyazo, and the Silverado, all at the recommendations of my server. 

Starting with the miso, it was made with mushrooms, green onions, tofu, and seaweed. The broth was a lot more white than what I usually have and it was made with a lot more filling than most miso soups, but it was absolutely delicious. There was a lot of flavor and the textures really pulled together. The tofu was there but in tiny bits, which I really enjoyed. 

The Silverado came next, which is a bit out of order considering my appetizer didn't come for another 15 minutes. The Silverado is a shrimp tempura unagi roll, covered with spicy crab, salmon, and plated on eel sauce. I have to say..the roll was definitely more sweet than spicy. It did start falling apart a little when I tried to pick it up, but it tasted really delicious. 

The gyazo, which is a Japanese potsticker, came last. It was served with Chinese black vinegar, which I found to be a bit overwhelming mixed with the already flavored pork and vegetable of the gyazo. It wasn't as satisfying as I thought it would be because I don't honestly believe they were made fresh, and chances of it being bought in package is more likely. 

All in all, I did enjoy the service and the food, but I do believe they need to put more thought into their identity. Having a majority Japanese menu but a mixed Asian atmosphere doesn't really work."}
{"text":"Zenshin will always get 5 stars from me! Definitely had been a while since the last time we were there! And I have to say they never disappoint! The happy hour is the best and the drinks are delicious. I love the lychee martini. Such a great taste all around from the food and the drinks. We like reserving a table during happy hour so that we are seated once we get there. The vibe is peaceful and the playlists are great! I love it here and I recommend everyone to try for the best fresh sushi! The miso salmon is to die for also!"}
{"text":"Wish I could've liked this place. I only tried the Ramon. The pork was completely inedible and the egg was uncooked.  The pork belly was the texture of an over cooked pork chop that your drunken friend would've  been excited to cook for you.  I ate what I could but when the waiter asked how everything was, I had to complain.  He argued with me and basically tried to inform me that Ramon is supposed to be like this.  Uncooked egg and inedible pork? Don't think so.  After he checked with the manager they took off a whopping 40%.  Will be my last time coming here.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Great at a good price, especially for the quality & variety. Also, very good service from Garrett & his recommendations were terrific."}
{"text":"Employees here are very nice and courteous with excellent service. The bartender Kapono was very friendly with perfect service. Though they did not have the beer I always come here for (Koshihikari Echigo) *the reason for the 4 star*. I'm assuming the manager, I think his name is Mike, was very professional and made sure we were taken care of. Definitely will be coming back and hoping that they have my beer on hand."}
{"text":"we really enjoyed ourselves. service was excellent and food was good!! staffs energy made it lively and fun! would recommend   there is great selection of food items for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Had to ask for utensils.

LIKE  The lobster potstickers. The filet mignon. The melon and yuzu semifreddo duo. (All three are Restaurant Week items.) The friendly server.

LOVE  Nothing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Entree portions were enormous.  Calamari appetizer was a bit too small but it was still yummy.  My son ordered the special of the day which was the huli huli chicken.  The manager came out to tell us that the dish was gonna take a little bit longer cause the chef wasn't happy with the gravy so he re-made the gravy.  The wait was totally worth it! The chicken was awesome and the gravy was perfect! Will return here for sure when back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"What a great little gem! Nice selections of sushi and typical Japanese options. Hamachi collar was awesome. All the sushi was better than expected considering where this place is. Also got a bento box and really enjoyed the salad. Everything was super fresh. Service was outstanding! Waiter was very attentive and knew the menu well. Also gave us some info on local shopping options to stock our condo. For the price vs quality this place is great. So much cheaper and just as good as anything on the strip."}
{"text":"Once again my wife and I while in Vegas stopped here but this time with our cousins and they LOVED it. Always good food and great customer service. I didn't see the owner this time but hopefully when we are back in a few months he will be there so we can say hi"}
{"text":"Top notch service from beginning to end!

We were having our family reunion at South Pointe Hotel.  It's our 7th year.  Last year, a few of us ate at Zenshin and ordered the Oxtail Soup/Oxtail curry.  The oxtail were huge and plentiful.  We decided to tell the others and make a point to going back the following year.

Prior to our visit, I called to tell them we had a large group coming for oxtail soup.  I didn't want them to run out.  Steve, the manager returned my call and thanked me for considering dining with them.

Upon my arrival, I went to the restaurant to meet with Steve.  He was very nice and professional.  He said he was all prepared for our reservations for Sunday, spoke to the chef and staff and assured me they will not run out of Oxtail.
On Sunday, he greeted me and my family, set us up in their private dining room, and introduced us to our waiter for the evening, Rory.  Rory and the rest of the wait staff were very attentive.  The sushi was fresh and yummy.  The Oxtail was fall-off-the-bone delicious. 
Thank you Steve and Rory!  All 15 of us had a fabulous time at your restaurant with our family and no one left hungry.  We will see you again next year!"}
{"text":"This place was the last stop of the day. Had some grear other grub but had to take the babies out for a little thank you for being so good. This place was conveniently located across from out resort and the fact that it was happy hour was the kicker.

Now, contextually, you'll have to understand that this restaurant is in a casino/resort that hosts alot of rodeos and things of that nature, so, I'm not sure they are going for completely authentic sushi, or sashimi. I'm guess they are going for a wider or broader audience so tje have diluted it, alot. But, I digress.

Obviously, the food was just okay. We ordered a bunch of stuff off the happy hour menu and the lunch menu which lasts until late afternoon. The best items were the pork skewers which were very very chewy, think I'm still chewing it a day later.  The crunchy shrimp roll was really crunchy, I think, due to maybe shells being in there was my guess. The oxtail tostadas were disappointing, didn't taste like oxtails though, and the seasoning was questionable. The waygu burger BG  ordered was killed by the kitchen, totally overcooked. And, it didn't really have much flavor which makes me sad because it's waygu??? The best thing we are I think we're the eggplant fries which were good once we put some salt on them. 

Overall, I would take the kids back here if they wanted to go and it was convenient but other than that, not so much..."}
{"text":"I went to this place because I read all the great reviews. I may have gone on a bad night but it was truly awful and I would never go back, nor would I advise anyone else to go. To begin with, the sushi chef lied and tried to pass off something that was not what he said. When I sat down, I asked the chef if he had hamachi toro, or hamachi belly. He told me \"no,\" they did not. Five minutes later he miraculously appears with a hunk of fish and tells me, \"look, I found some hamachi toro!\" Really? Ok, I guess it could happen at 10:00 pm...He prepares it, hands it to me, I eat it...it was eatable, but it WASN'T TORO!! It was regular old hamachi and by old I mean tomorrow it will no longer be good except for deep fry. My son is a sushi chef. I know my toro!! It only went downhill from there. You would only ever expect salmon skin to be used in very small quantities, almost as a condiment. We ordered the \"double down salmon\" roll, believing by the description it was going to be some great salmon with a sprinkling of salmon skin. Wrong! It was a roll full--FULL--of crunchy, salty salmon skin, with two anemic, tasteless pieces of salmon, but mostly unripe avocado slices on top. Disgusting!! AND, we felt the chef KNEW this was distasteful as he and his fellow chefs were joking about the salmon skin as he was making it. Lastly, we ordered the \"sizzling tuna\" sashimi. \"Sizzling\" apparently is accomplished by passing a torch flame over the pieces until they are somewhat grey and lukewarm. I don't know how this place got such rave reviews, but if someone is going by those reviews as I did, you should know it isn't always so great."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and uncle on Friday around 5:30. Pretty quiet still, but restaurant filled up as we finished.

Food was good. This is Hawaiian-style Japanese. 

Eggplant Fries were the decisive winner. Get these now!  

The calimari tempura was ok. The pork belly was good, but with the sweet and smoky sauce and sour pickle you lose the pork belly goodness. The chicken teriyaki bowl was excellent. Very moist because they used dark meat. The ton katsu was also very moist and crispy. Didn't try the sushi, but looked like they had some worthwhile selections. 

Overall, good experience. Nice staff, not overly loud, decent food. Get the eggplant fries to go if you're not interested in the rest. They were that good!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The yellowtail sashimi was good, but the tuna and salmon tasted refrigerated for quite a while. Did not taste fresh. And 32 bucks for a low quality sashimi special is a lot too expensive. Give me fresh sashimi and I'll be ok with that price."}
{"text":"Nice little Japanese restaurant and very spacious too. 

Wasn't a busy night so we were seated immediately. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and my friend ordered the Spicy Tuna Bowl. Service was very fast and the waiter was really friendly!

The ramen smelled delicious when. He brought it out. However I found the broth to be a bit too salty. There were thick cuts of meat and the ramen noodles were pretty thick too. It was good but not the best. If it was less salty I would have enjoyed it more. 

I also got a taste of the spicy tuna bowl and wish I had got that instead! It was a pretty big bowl too! 

Overall I had a good experience here and will probably come back when it's happy hour :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here one night just to try out a different Japanese/Asian restaurant. 
We were standing by the hostess waiting to be seated for about 15min with no one else in line but us, although we could understand that she was on the phone with another customer who had a lot of questions. Regardless, I wish the manager, who was walking around just asking people how their dinner is, could have given us any of the many tables that were available that night. 
After we were seated, the server took about another 15-20min to get to us and said she thought our order was taken already. She was nice about it though but I still expected a little more than that.
My husband had their beef teriyaki and I had a couple of their sushis. 
His beef teriyaki was extremely disappointing as the beef seemed old and re-heated. It had an ok flavor to it but the quality of the meet was just terrible. 
The two rolls I ordered were just ok and had too much rice packed into it. There was nothing memorable about it at all. Paying more than $70 for a meal that I would have quickly tossed in the trash was painful. 
The one star I'm giving this restaurant is for our server who was kind enough to keep coming back to re-fill our hot tea. Other than that, I would never recommend anyone I know to this place to waste their money. There's a lot of other better Japanese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Love coming during happy hour. Price is good and so is the food and the service. I like the crispy shrimp roll and desert the fudge brownie was good"}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with sushi! Hawaiian style spicy ahi is a much try! Chicken karaage was on point also! Will be back to eat when in town."}
{"text":"A cute place located inside the South Point casino. Service was great & food came pretty quick. I had the tuna fever roll which was very tasty & the presentation of it was amazing
 Very Instagram worthy. Moving onto desert we got the tempura ice cream, which was good but a little bready. Thought it wouldve been a little more crispy but then again it's not the same as fried ice cream. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Great sushi, fresh and full of flavor. Good deal for the prices which are reasonable. Service is great,  writing this review is making me hungry."}
{"text":"Love the food here! The dessert Semi-Fredo Is very very good too. We get it every time we go there. You have to be very specific on what teriyaki steak you would like. The past two times we ordered the more expensive teriyaki steak. But we got the teriyaki beef."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour selection for both drinks and food. Best cocktail ever was the strawberry Bangkok. The apple mojito tasted like straight up Whiskey and the pomegranate ginger was not that great either. Hamachi Kama was small but tasty, rolls were average, garlic edamame was good, didn't like the sliders tho. The beef in the sliders were TOUGH and the bun tasted too sweet."}
{"text":"Our server, LISA was outstanding. Because of her we will be back again and definitely request her section. They have excellent beers on draft and a great happy hour menu. I was shocked to see that their happy hour menu is DAILY!--- great prices!!! It was perfect. Great food, great service. We will be back very soon! Thank you Lisa for being so kind and amazing!!!!!!!!! :) :) :) :)"}

{"text":"Wow!! Great atmosphere, amazing staff & the food... Delicious! Enjoyed every bite followed by a surprise birthday dessert for my Date... which she luved! Would recommended to anyone looking for an amazing evening!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Clean. My husband loves the sushi roll he got. Kingkong size and he had 2, he liked it so much. Me I stuck with my vegan rolls. Only thing tho the rice wasn't really fresh. Rice kernel should be whole and chewy. The sushi rice had been marinated for awhile where it started to break down and lost its chewiness. It was still good though. Service was great, nice people, and I was full, which is rare with vegan diet but I left satisfied with the portions per $$.

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Happy hour here is the best! 
Food is great. Ate there 3 of the 5 days we stayed @ South Point Casino"}
{"text":"our server (I failed by not getting his name) was SO awesome. definitely started off our meal right by making some great drink recommendations. went with the sayuri nigouri sake to celebrate and then followed up with asahi and sapporo beers.

definitely not our first rodeo at zenshin, but we decided to get fancy tonight and ordered the deluxe sampler, and a bunch of different rolls. the miso soup was definitely fresh and delicious just like the rolls. we went with a crunch roll, dragon roll, double down salmon, spicy tuna, Philadelphia roll, and some type of mango roll. we couldn't stop eating!!

they have a great happy hour menu too."}

The bust boys clean up fast and when we're were leaving he even said have a nice evening with a smile ... Check this spot out I hope your experience is as good as mine"}
{"text":"Great Japanese spot in south point! Never knew and never expected this great!! Thanks to yelper that put on here! Really had fun time at chef Chris and Rex they are Hawaiian great chef they know about sushi!!! Very nice looking guys also! Also Bartender making really perfect drinks didn't have chance to say thank you. Tall white guy was bartender . Didn't ask name but he makes really good drinks. They have happy hour 2 time that's really smart idea also!!! I stay in M but I rather come this Japanese place than one have in M. Highly recommended !!!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is excellent. Had oysters and a spicy tuna roll.  Service was excellent. Angel is a keeper as she is so upbeat and smiling.  Not to mention she's on top of stuff. Will revisit."}
{"text":"This place was yummy!!! Sashimi was so fresh and delicious! Atmosphere was great.  This place was just as great as LA spots. I had an amazing drink with strawberries and a chili, jalapeño chili. Great combo. I definitely will hit this place up again when I go to Vegas.  Even if I stay on the strip,  I will drive back over here."}
{"text":"Sushi was expensive but worth every penny!! 

Service: 5/5 Our server was constantly checking up on us and always refilled our drinks. The manager was also walking around to ask everyone if everything was good. 

Food: 5/5!!! FIRST TIMERS MUST TRY:
-Salmon sashimi (THE SASHIMI IS THICK & TASTE FRESH) 
-Rainbow was so good *_* 
-Silverado had fat sashimi on top & man oh man, was that tasty *_*"}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with this place. We went during Happy Hour. Looking at the menu I thought their happy hour prices were great so I was excited until we received our order. My excitement quickly turned into dissappointment. The portions commensurate with the prices. One of the things I really enjoy about Japanese food is the pride and time the Chefs take in the presentation of the food. There was none of that here. The sushi roll I ordered looked as if they were trying to discourage us from coming during happy hour. A 5-year old could have done a better job. I was SMH. Well, it worked. This is our first and last. I will never recommend this place to anyone especially to my Japanese friends."}
{"text":"My favorite place to come and dine-in. A big plus bc it's by the house. Everything on the menu are delicious."}
{"text":"All I can say is that sushi should not taste fishy. We cashed out and left after the appetizers.  Not sure what happened since we have heard others say it was great, but we will pass next time."}
{"text":"By far the BEST uber fresh Uni spot in Vegas. The quality of the fish is outstanding and Alfredo at the Sushi Bar is a delight and truly enjoys his job. Delightful spot on off hours, especially early for the top selection of high quality selection."}
{"text":"Checked it out for the \"late night happy hour,\" and left very pleased.  Enjoyed the garlic chicken bites and the 777 sushi roll.

Shout out to Jane and Jenna G., you gals rock!  Next time I'm there, I'll come see you guys!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The place is inside South Point Casino. I have to say, its not bad. The oxyail curry was very tender, it was amazing. Miso soup was not too salty. Very prompt service when it comes to refilling iced water. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"In the mood for soup so we ate here for the first time last night...exceptionsl. firstly, service was \"over the top\"..never wanted for anything. Ordered Udon,Ramen and a Spicy Mexican Roll. All were delicious and satisfied our cravings. Hot Green Tea was also the best. Will eat here again to try other yummy things on the menu...recommend others do the same."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat at the south point hotel.  They have lots of inventive sushi makis on the menu. Try the hamachi kama.  Friendly staff, skilled sushi chefs. They have a happy hour at 2:00pm - 6:00pm. Everything is fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decent service, decent food, decent pricing. What's interesting about this place is it's in the casino floor of the southpoint hotel and casino.  The southpoint is an interesting people watching dynamic.  A lot of Midwesterners and middle America.  It was my first time eating sushi where I saw everyone around me with a cowboy hat on.  I was dressed in a suit and felt way overdressed by the party.  If anyone thinks sushi is a shi shi experience come to this place and you will see otherwise."}
{"text":"This place is Hawaiian/Japanese-ish. They great you with an \"Irasshaimashae!\" and thank you with a Mahalo. A bit odd..

Service was awesome! Our server was very fast, attentive and very kind! The food runners and host were also very friendly. 

I ordered the eggplant parmesan fires which were super good. Perfectly crispy and not greasy and quite addicting! I also got a few sushi rolls which were pretty good and standard for Vegas. 

Sadly my Miso Ramen, was really really bad :/ Being Japanese and a ramen fanatic and having experienced many kinds of ramen in Japan and America, I kinda have an idea of how it should kinda taste. Basically the broth was like they skimmed all the fat and grease from a fryer and put it in my bowl. It had no flavor and no evidence of miso.. The chashu pork was tender and the noodles were cooked perfect, however I could not taste anything due to my grease broth. It was also supposed to come with tamago (egg) which it did not. 

I let our server know of the nasty grease ramen and she quickly took it away and apologized. I had already eaten half the ramen (I was super hungry and didn't want to be rude) but I felt quite sick and ran to the bathroom and puked. I was sick for the next two days... :( 

Though it was not the fault of the serving staff and I don't blame them, I do however blame who ever made the broth and called it \"miso broth.\" Certainly not a good representation of how real miso ramen should taste, so hopefully they can raise the bar and learn from a mistake. 

I will maybe try this place again since the service and the other food items were good... but... I really hate puking so we shall see.."}
{"text":"Really good sushi and prices weren't so bad at all. We sat at the bar area, great service too. We also checked in to get the 10%. I would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"It is difficult to give a full detailed review of Zenshin since all I ordered last night was an appetizer and a beer but I can tell you a story of that much. 

It all started when I won tickets to a screening of Last Jedi from my bank. It happened to be booked for the theatre at the South Point so I came in from work and prepared to get my nerd on. I had some time to kill before the show so I walked around the casino looking for food. The National Finals Rodeo was in town and the South Point was the place to be for all the cowboys. With all those cowboys over running the casino, most every dining option was packed. But not Zenshin. There were pleanty of open tables and no line. Plus they have happy hour specials from 2:00 to 6:00 PM daily and it was now only 5:00. Since I was a party of one, I was seated immediately at the bar. 

I already knew what I wanted to order having looked through the menu outside. I asked for a Sapporo beer ($4.50) and an order of the chicken lettuce wraps ($5.00). My beer was up within a couple of minutes and was simply a nicely poured lager. Refreshing but nothing spectacular. My lettuce wraps came out just a couple of minutes after the beer. There were three pieces of bib lettuce on the plate each with its own small fill of ground chicken and mushrooms. I could smell the mushrooms above all else. Fine by me as a mushroom fanatic. There was also a small bowl of thick sauce which I spooned over the chicken. Each wrap lasted about three bites.  Not huge portions but it was just an appetizer. Despite the small size they had big flavor. A punch of salt from the sauce. Earthiness from the mushrooms. A hint of spice. It was perfect to get me through the movie. 

At $5 for this app, I am not upset. But I would never pay full price for it, whatever full price is. And the beer at $4.50 was high too. Especially for a happy hour pint. Though I guess it was technically an import. All in all, the beer was cold and the food hot. Service was friendly and the cowboys were not (just kidding guys). And everything came to my table fast. 

Historically I don't really come to the South Point more than once a decade so I probably wont be stopping back by Zenshin. If by chance I should I find myself back here, I'd be happy to give it another go."}
{"text":"Not bad. The only reliable restaurant we found inside this casino. Tried their veggie bowl, was super fresh & filling. Miso soup was average."}
{"text":"5 stars for sergios service he bussed our table and  always made sure our table was clean and drinks were always full!!!"}
{"text":"$6 for 2 pieces of salmon nigiri that took 40min to come to the table. Really over priced and slow service. However, the gyoza was pretty decent, and the chicken bowl came out quick. 

tl;dr not horrible, but not worth it.

**edit** I appreciate the business responded, and that says something about the management. Bumped to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Do not eat at the restaurant!!!! From the hostess to the server to the management all were rude and disrespectful. The food was below average, but it was the attitude of the employees that was really terrible!!!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the South Point for the first time and wanted sushi type of food, so my family decided to try it out since it's inside the hotel and the first time we ate here I knew I would come back. Sushi is just so good. Try to catch them on a happy hour time though cause they have a good selection for great prices."}
{"text":"This little place is located in the right hand side, back of the South Point hotel and casino, next to Steak'n Shake. First time here was a year ago and the sushi was great. Second time here I decided to get one of there signature entrees. Not very flavorful and the portion was a bit smaller than I'd imagine. But lovely service, very accommodating and I don't feel so bad about my experience because I had a $25 off dining coupon from the Grandview."}
{"text":"This was our second time at Zenshin. The food was excellent. I gave 4 stars because we were seated at the sushi bar and I took over 15 mins for someone to acknowledge our presence; not even for water. However, when our server Emiko arrived she was very attentive and our food came out quickly. Service was great after the earlier mishap. Everything was delicious! She offered us dessert because of the wait. Thank you Emiko!  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Soo disappointed.. Last time we were in Las Vegas we received great service and excellent food. But this time we received non of that, our waiter Garret was cold and unprofessional. He didn't pay any attention to us until 30 mins after sitting down (we even made a reservation) and then forgot to bring 3 of our drinks. After we received of food from another server he ignored us until we received the bill. I even tried to flag him down for a drink refill and he ignored me! Will never go back to this sushi place again!"}
{"text":"I came here so many times and I never been disappointed! The menu is perfect! You can pick easily something for all your family! The staff is very professional and nice! They have an happy our menu with the low prices. I highly recommend the Philadelphia Tempura, edamame, salmon cake... !
It's in the South Point Casino, easy to come, easy to park, easy to find! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here in a week! We were looking for a sushi restaurant for our date night and wanted to stay close to the house. I never thought twice about this restaurant before because of the location, which is inside of the Southpoint but when we saw the positive reviews we decided to try it. This will be our new go to local sushi favorite, at least for a while! Everything was very fresh and they have unique rolls. I'm a big fan of cilantro on top of sushi rolls and they had a few to choose from which sold me immediately. The rolls were sized correctly, most sushi places love to make the rolls so big that you can't fit it inside your mouth but that's not the case here. They have good happy hour specials and they're open late which is a plus. They also have a 10% off yelp check in which is always a perk."}
{"text":"The sashimi is wonderful!!!!!  Some of the appetizers can be over sauced at times but they are really good.  Recently they added daily sushi specials which is really nice."}
{"text":"The quick: Service is horrible, food is good. 

I dined here as a party of 7 so maybe our larger party size threw this restaurant off? I'm not sure, but the service was so awful in so many ways. The waitress consistently forgot we were a party of 7 and only brought 5 of everything (plates, silverware, etc). She even forgot to take the orders of 2 of the people present! 

We were so shocked by what was going on that we thought for certain we were being pranked by a TV show...but no such luck.

One of the appetizers we ordered arrived at the END of our meal. The timing of all the food was just awful. The bill rung up incorrectly to top it all off. 

Thankfully the food was good. I didn't expect much of the sushi but it was fairly good. And the bites I had of everyone's food around me was pleasant as well. If you get the edamame, try the chili garlic flavor (or whatever the non-regular flavor is), it's surprisingly delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person that is too quick to only say and share what's wrong with my experience when I eat out.  I'm the type of person that will say and share the positives as well. (Honestly, it takes a little bit more effort for me to be compelled to say or share the positive than the negatives like most people do).  Zenshin's owner and general manager had reached out to me after my negative experience.  I shared my story and they replied that I felt it was sincere.  They handled my situation fair and well.  I am actually impress of how they handled themselves towards me because during our communication via email, I was still feeling the bad taste in my mouth regarding the service I and the rest of my group received in their restaurant.  Everyone knows that first impression counts and they failed miserably on that category but the lasting impression I received left me feeling respected.  Thank you for not giving up on me Zenshin.  I can definitely respect that.  Moving on........here is my final review.  The food is delicious (like I mentioned in my original review).  If service was good the first time around, I would have no problem giving you Zenshin all 5 stars.  So....the fact that I went from rating Zenshin 1 star to 4 stars should probably give everyone an idea that their food is a delight.  Again, thank you."}
{"text":"Good food and we received great service by the team led by Christine! Best server I've had in months!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. The place had adequate  seating and have large booths. The menu was more difficult to read (names of dishes) than what it should be. Service was just fine. The food presentation was decent, but the sushi was ground fish which I do not care for as much. The calamari (which is called something good else in Japananse) were the legs of squid and larger than you might expect from traditional calamari. If you get this know that it will be chewy, but not like leather, more like rubber."}
{"text":"Good food. Quite the wait. The staff are nice. They were a bit busy so no one came by to refill our tea. The food is good enough to try for sure so I'd recommend it but the bar is set pretty high for sushi. We got the nigiri sampler and the 007 (we just saw spectre.) A nice variety for the price and a good amount of food. If you are in the casino and in the mood for sushi you should stop by."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour which is everyday from 2 pm-6 pm, we were seated quickly by a friendly young Asian lady,we started off with Strawberry Bangkok and a Money Jacket,plus we ordered karage chicken, spicy tuna sushi roll, calif.sushi roll, teriyaki chicken pizza, and miso soup all of the food was delicious also on the menu they have specialty rolls,baked & tempura rolls, sashimi, nigiri or sashimi, soups, noodles, & rice and desserts,there is no restroom inside but there is one like 25 feet away,definitely a come back to, nothing over $7.00 HH."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Especially loved the steak that was one of the daily specials."}
{"text":"I tend to go here for the happy hr. It is from 2-6 everyday!  The service is always great and the restaurant is very clean.  The sushi is also awesome.  I think it's a great hidden gem.  

Happy hour prices are no more than $6. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that they had a great selection of sushi, and had PLENTY of vegan options in the menu .  I had the veggie rolls, and natto rolls and they were delicious! They also have great items on their happy hour menu, and we took advantage of few items there.  Our waitress provided my husband and me great service, and we left satisfied and happy with the food, environment, and service."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  We also live Alderon as our server.  He and Rory are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Yuck. This place is horrible, avoid! avoid! avoid! I had been anxiously awaiting for this place to open and it was one big disappointment. We sat at the sushi bar and it wasn't really that busy in the place, I think it was a Monday night earlier this month and they had only been open a couple of weeks. 

The rolls are not rolls, please. They lack quality ingredients and flavor, just .. eh. Extremely high prices, I'm talking $14 or more for a measly excuse of a roll. It's not the strip, guys, and it is no high end Japanese joint. Terrible. We all left very disappointed. Oh, and they don't even bring you those wooden sushi plates or any ginger or wasabe. We finally asked for some ginger and the guy acted like we were crazy. We got a side of ginger but sheesh it should be standard to give that to every sushi customer right away.

and...they..are..SO...SLOW!!!! One sushi chef for the entire place??

Mexican roll - terrible. Not worth $12 an there was nothing inside except old, cold fried crab tempura. Gross. The 777 roll was just OK but it too was not worth $12. I hope the owner or manager is reading this and makes some changes or this place won't last."}
{"text":"Chaya is the bomb! One of the best sushi chefs in Vegas. He makes our night every time in taste, presentation and humor! :-D You won't be disappointed! 
UPDATE: Chaya is still the best! Such a wonderful personal experience every time! We love ALL sushi and usually just let him have fun and serve us anything he wants!"}
{"text":"We honestly came here as a last resort.   The line at the buffet and the Steak N Shake were super long.

We had sushi as an appetizer.  It was great!

I'll admit my party of 8 was not a fan of the miso soup.  I was the only one who liked it.  I think maybe it was the ginger??

My husband and I got the the bento boxes,  the rest of our party had the bowls I think.

The bento boxes were PERFECT!!  Loved the salad too!  Yum!! Great value!!  If I had to change anything it would be that my garlic chicken could use a sauce over it but that's really just nit picking.

We had great service and the place was clean and nice.

Most importantly-  great value!!"}
{"text":"Great allergy friendly restaurant. My allergen is dairy, so I knew I could pretty much have most of the stuff on the menu since Japanese cooking uses no dairy. But my server did double check with the kitchen that there was no butter on the rice or any other dairy containing ingredients in what I ordered. (california roll and teriyaki chicken bowl) I would definitely come back here or any of the other south point restaurants since they are all allergy friendly."}
{"text":"Normally the service is top notch..  Don't know if its a new server but I ordered entree and received no salad or soup.   The service was so slow. Very disappointed..  Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever....took 40 minutes to get food. Server was very incompetent, but we tipped her anyways. My chicken teriyaki plate came with a soup, I got the soup 40 minutes after ordering with my meal.  Food not that great either to wait for such a long time. Never, ever, going to this sushi place."}
{"text":"Beet salad, all the nigiri, foie gras chawan-mushi was soooooo yummy! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese food in Las Vegas. Love the atmosphere. Love the employees. Love everything about this place. Had a great experience with my family. I would highly recommend this to everyone in the Las Vegas area. mmmmmmmm!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the octopus, eel, and sea urchin. Fabulous. Great staff very friendly. Love this place."}
{"text":"Food was fine, and our server was really sweet. My mom and I had an order of a California roll, a Crunch roll, fried oysters (3), and a Hamachi Kama (yellowtail collar). It was happy hour on a Tuesday and it was slower than i expected, which was nice. The only things that were meh was that the Hamachi Kama was kind of burnt, and one of the servers spilled soy sauce on our table and didnt clean it up... Okay...
But not a bad place, especially when it comes to happy hour."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Zenshin Asian Restaurant for a while due to health issues, so we decided to go there last night and I am so glad we did.  We went for the late night Happy Hour and everything was delicious.  The sushi was fabulous, the mini burgers delicious, the salmon cake terrific, everything we ordered came to the table and looked so good we didn't know which one to try first :)   Steve the Manager came over to greet us, and we talked and he genuinely is such a nice person, I'm glad he is in charge of the restaurant, he certainly makes you feel welcome.  So my review is TERRIFIC SUSHI, TERRIFIC WAITER, FABULOUS MANAGER. Looking for a place for a late night Happy Hour or just for dinner, try Zenshin you will not be disappointed..... it is all the way in the back of the Southpoint Hotel so you have to look for it, but it is well worth the effort.  You won't be disappointed.  Absolutely GREAT!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Time to wake up those taste buds with a quick bite!  

We started off with some things that just got our mouth to water: BBQ PORK BELLY, OYSTERS and  SHISITO PEPPERS.  I was hesitant about the shisito peppers cause they were a bit simple, but that was all it needed to be.  The plates were cleared out along with the savory BBQ pork belly and fresh oysters.  The appetizers where a great start especially if its something you just want to nibble on with a drink on the side.

I've been getting into trying new brews lately and the server was very knowledgeable and introduced me to a great beer line up.  Most memorable one was KOSHIHIKARI ECHIGO.  I had to make a side note just so I can find this beer again cause there was no way I could have made up an acronym to remember that.  My friend gave the perfect description feeling of a geisha underneath a waterfall...refreshing and you can't help but say ah!

JALAPENO YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI!! Enough said I savored every slice! Totally fit with the one commercial, \"When you really like something, you just want more. You want MORE!\"   Definitely my favorite next to the dessert! 

 Thank goodness I still had some room for the mini malassadas! They were a warm delight with the dipping sauce finished the meal with perfect bang of satisfaction!  

Definitely need to take advantage of their happy hour on my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Ate solo this trip. My server was friendly and always around when I needed her. Took advantage of the happy hour and ordered some rolls. I ordered the crunch roll with soy paper (it was very good!) but the 777 on the happy hour menu was strange. It said topped with spicy tuna but what came out wasn't just spicy tuna. My server explained they blend the tuna with something to make it spicy. But the result was this strange creamy, fishy paste on top. Not what I was expecting. I'll definitely be back here again though. Nice place, nice service and great prices. I will avoid the 777 in the future, however, and any other roll topped with \"spicy tuna\"."}
{"text":"We visited during the daily extended happy hour that runs from 2PM to 6PM.  My wife ordered a Blushing Jasmine (Grey Goose L'Orange, pama liqueur, cranberry juice, spritz of jasmine water and an eatable orchid as garnish).  I chose the strawberry Bangkok (strawberry colada, Patron silver, Malibu coconut, fresh sweet & sour, muddled strawberries with a Thai hot pepper).  We also ordered a vegetable pizza - a tasteless crust topped with eggplant, mushrooms, tomato, onion, goat cheese and tomato sauce that was undercooked.  We will return for the drinks and take a pass on the pizza."}
{"text":"The service was very bad ! Took them 20 min to bring us a menu. Sushi was served right away, but we had to wait 30 min and ask twice for my chicken katsu and on top of that they forgot the curry. Sad!"}
{"text":"Appetizer pork belly is amazing!!! Hawaii Peeps, it's like home... Miso butterfish is good and OX tail soup is better than Cal Hotel"}
{"text":"Great service. Garrett was out mediator: patient, attentive, suggestive and pleasing. The rolls were delic; I was not sure what to expect, but I definitely will come back again when I stay at The Grandview At Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu!  Only $4.00 for California roll!!  Fast service.  We sat at the sushi bar and were treated with great respect!   I had the crunch roll as was very happy with the sweet crunchy taste.  I can see why it was voted high in Las Vegas.  

Try it!  I know you'll like it!"}
{"text":"We've ate at Zenshin a few times during our stay at South Point. The sushi and entries are all above average - There was one roll that was especially delicious, but I forgot the name (sorry!).  The garlic/chilli edamame was delicous, but may be have a bit too much garlic or spice for some ppl's taste - not mine...I loved it!  Great service as well.  Only downside was that they had no Sake (at all) during my last visit..."}
{"text":"As a newcomer to Vegas, i am very pleased to have Zenshin in such close proximity to my new home as i visit often.  The food is delicious and with a wide enough variety to keep me coming back and trying something new. .  Aside from the great food, I have had nothing but excellent service every visit,  especially when the manager Shannon Tilton ensures your experience is nothing other then the best. ..His attention to detail ensures that your time spent is comfortable and enjoyable.  .I highly recommend Zenshin not only for a dinning experience but as my go to place for special occasions as it has become one of my favorite go to places.   Good job Mr.Tilton and staff...see you real soon"}
{"text":"I gave them 5 stars because 1, my order was delicious . Perfect, I should say. 2, awesome customer service. From the hostess to the waiter. 

I ordered garlic chicken and I'm very picky with mine. I haven't liked any garlic chicken from any other place except for Island Sushi's. Luckily, this place is owned by the same owner (says the waiter) so the recipe was the same. I was very satisfied  

Everyone at my table liked their food as well.  Spicy tuna roll and ultimate shrimp roll."}
{"text":"Elegant and professional restaurant ambiance.  Busy and loud casino but once in the restaurant, calmness ensued.
 The servers were attentive and courteous.  Loved each of the delicious entree dishes we ordered.  It was a pleasant dining experience.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Great service & we enjoyed the food. We tried the soft shell sandwich, poke roll & a few different appetizers. We will surely be back again. 

Try the creme brûlée & the deep fried ice cream. It was really good. Enough for 2 people to share each plate. 

They also have a 10% discount off your check with the Yelp check in.. don't forget to take advantage of that."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! After trying sushisamba yesterday, and then dining here... Soo much better! and it's just downstairs inside SouthPoint hotel. The service was quick, food came out fast, and we satisfied by the end of the meal. 

The chili garlic edamame is the best I've ever tried!!! I could seriously eat two bowl of it in one sitting. (I've already dined here twice and gotten it every time hehe) 

The dynamite green mussel is so bomb! Very cheesy though, but nonetheless so good. The salmon poke (also on the HH menu) was good! Also on the HH menu was fried oysters!! So cheap and good! I also tried the 777 & Spicy Mexican roll. 777 was delicious, spicy Mexican was okay! Kinda plain. The YT sashimi was very fresh! I enjoyed all the sushi I ate here. And let me tell you, I am a picky sushi critic. 

The tonkotsu ramen with pork belly was okay! Nothing toooo special. 

If I lived in Vegas, I'd drive here just to eat this place :)"}
{"text":"Bartender seemed a bit snappy and rushed us to order our food/ drinks. I did enjoy the hot green tea and California rolls. The beef short ribs could have been more tender"}
{"text":"Great food and portions. Had the Teri beef sliders, veggie stir fry, crunch roll and chicken teri bowl. All were devious and more than enough for 2 females. Very friendly staff!! Great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"One the best places to eat here inside the SouthPoint Casino. I use my comps from poker here. They have a great happy hour menu...... $6 and $7 sushi rolls. I had the Chicken Katsu off the menu which is also very good."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the Restaurant. I'd give the service a 3 at best. The martini I ordered was not chilled when served. The waiter didn't attend to our table as I would expect.  The restaurant was not very busy, so I couldn't use that for a reason. When the bill came the server could not explain our bill. He said he would ask the attendant at the resister. The only positive aspect of our visit was the food. Both of our orders were very good. I'm not sure if we would give this restaurant a second try."}
{"text":"Yum! Came here for my birthday dinner. We were seated right away and our waiter was very friendly. 

We ordered miso soup, 2 orders of albacore and about 5 rolls total. I got the unagi roll and the spicy albacore roll. Husband got the rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll and 1 other roll I'm not remembering. Everything we tried was excellent and tasted fresh. Loved it! 

We didn't have to wait too long for the food either. I think the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the ponzu sauce that we got on the side for the albacore. It was too sweet for my taste. But totally not a deal breaker for me. We'd come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Just had the oxtail soup and it was amazing!! The happy hour is also great. You get a good amount of food for only $20. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, service is always great. Closest sushi bowls to ones made in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Great Sushi Bar At The South Point Fresh Sushi Delicious Rainbow Rolls, I also had the Himachi So Tender Like Butter (YUMMM)!!  Great Staff Great Drinks Open Late For Dinner Until 1 Am Perfect After Dancing. You Cant Go Wrong Here Fantastic Place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Even if you are not a sushi lover it is amazing! Hats off Chef Dawson!
If I could give 10 stars I would! 
Also they served a group of 16 so efficient. 

Great sushi in Vegas Served here!"}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone.  My wife and I started going there out of convenience before attending a movie at the South Pointe.  But then we continued going back because we liked the food and the staff is very helpful.  This most recent visit I had sushi for the first time and it was very good - and reasonably priced.  We have company coming and are going to make it one of our stops on their visit."}
{"text":"2 days late but after my experience at tgi Fridays I wanted to post a positive review for a change instead of a rant. First off this restaurant is in a casino so expect a bit of a wait to get seated during dining or late hours. I had the teriyaki steak while my parents had the oxtail soup which is usually their favorite . But while the portion was big the meat was not the usual fall off the bone they are used to , the Teri steak on the other hand was decent but it was the restaurant style where the sauce is separate from the meat itself as a dip, I should have inquired to which way they served it before asking for it to be well done , an error on my part. Also as a side I got a panko style pork belly , 2 small pieces with average taste , IMHO not worth the price. The greeter was friendly as well as the restaurant but due to the average oxtail soup and skewers, it's hard to say it is worth the price charged . Unfortunately there are limited choices within the hotel that serve rice so it is still better than the buffet rice.  I had eaten earlier in the day."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing customer service to the max. Very welcoming extremely helpful, precise service! I recommend this restaurant. Very good!!"}
{"text":"Rounding down from 2.5 sta I would have given if I could. Placed a \"to go\" order and wasn't even offered to sit on the bench inside the resturant to wait for our food. Saw it come out and sit at the counter for 7 minutes before walking over and asking for the Mgr. All Keani had to do was offer us a seat inside or at least call us over when the food was ready for pick up but NOPE, instead she let our food sit on the counter and DIDN'T call us over from the slot machines we were sitting at in front of the resturant (we don't gamble) we just sat there looking over and even getting eye contact with the girls at the counter. Mike the Mgr handled it well, offered us a seat INSIDE and had a new order of tempura cooked up.i sure hope Mike changes the way people get treated here. We were dressed pretty casual but no reason to treat us like that. California rolls, spicy salmon rolls and tempura was very tasty and what we expected the quality to be like. 2 Stars for the good food, 1/2 Star (if I could for MIke making it right). I'll shoot Steven an email and see what comes of it.

Updated review, Mike, Steve and Terrance are excellent examples of Business leaders that take pride in customer service. We will be back to Zenshin for the great food & customer service."}
{"text":"Happy hour is decently priced, but the quality was no good. I would've been real upset if I was paying full price."}
{"text":"I felt like a VIP.  The atmosphere was not stuffy but really chill we got seated we were soon greeted by the executive chef Yoji, that gave us a tour of the kitchen.  Which was not expected but well worth it. The Kitchen  was clean and organized which got us more excited about the food.  

Yoji recommended the Japanese Ox Tail Curry... Yummy... Authentic Japanese Curry with tender ox tail that falls right off the bone served over rice... This was the first dish that came out and it was so delightful.

We also had sushi the Blazin Tuna, was one of my favorites, Spicy tuna with a bit of Cajun tuna topping it off.  All the sushi was great and was fresh.   We had about 5 more rolls and the Cajun Albacore Sashimi ... They all left us wanting more to bad we were full..  

The Service was great and was checking in with us. They made us feel at home.  

We took my cousin that lives in town and she says she told me this place will be in her eating rotation from now on.  

We will definitely be back and will bring more people too....

Its worth the the stop at South Point Casino."}
{"text":"Me and my 2 friends were staying at South Point and came in at about 630pm on a Friday and were seated right away. SUCH great service. Seriously everyone here was so attentive and accommodating, we had a great experience. Miso soup was really good. I got the mango spicy tuna roll and added cucumber, which was delicious, my friends got miso ramen and a veggie rice bowl with curry. Everything was great! Try the chili garlic edamame!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Southpoint Hotel for a convention and found this gem. The sushi was really good, though a bit trendy. But hey, it's Vegas! The service was pretty good and their dessert lumpia was to die for."}
{"text":"I live 5 min away and had seen the signs for the restaurant many times but never stopped by. We love to eat healthy and we were out late tonight. Dining healthy late is almost impossible. We had decided to try it and we're blown away by the food. Steve the manager personally took our order tonight and his customer service was amazing. He's such a nice guy and it seems as everyone liked him. Super friendly! I highly recommend coming here. They even have amazing happy hour prices."}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal at Zenshin. We started with the garlic fries and onion rings and liked them both. I had the crab sliders and they they were delicious! I'm actually craving them as I write this review. My dining companions all had the garlic chicken bowls and they raved about them. Lisa was our server and her bright energy and friendliness capped our meal off. All of the employees were extremely helpful and had genuine smiles on their faces. It was such an enjoyable experience. We will return."}
{"text":"Have had great visits but last night they brought me the wrong entree and after everyone at our table was finished eating and plates removed they said the one I ordered would be out soon. I elected to not have my entree. The manager came and apologized and offered a free drink or dessert. I guess that was to help. Had to laugh. It was my birthday too. I did have some appetizers, soup and salad. They seemed to have more employees than patrons. Not too sure if I will return. We shall see"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always amazing food and excellent service. Prices aren't too and for a casino. I suggest you call in advance around happy hour. It gets so busy. Their Yakosaba is to die for"}
{"text":"Crunchy rolls are the best here!
I can't have enough chicken lettuce wraps!
This place is heaven.
We got here during Happy Hour and price are pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot Its all delicious not 5 stars because service and portion sizes are not consistent"}
{"text":"Janessa was out waitress and she was wonderful. It was my birthday celebrated with my mom and dear friend. Janessa explained any menu questions we had and we noticed the rest of the staff was just as friendly. Thank you to all"}
{"text":"Had reservations the other night and was not seated until 15 minutes after arrival. Place was not busy. Disappointed that they took in others without reservations before us. One star off for that. The food was good. Happy hour specials were the way to go. Hamachi grilled collar was excellent along with the Chile spiced edamame which tasted more like black bean sauce. Had the poke bowl which was more than filling but wouldve appreciated less of an amount with better quality fish. When you want the convenience of eating Japanese food where you are staying then this fits the bill. Otherwise there are better places around."}
{"text":"I came in last night and the hostess sat me at the bar. I was graciously greeted by my server/bartender, Yui. (I hope I spelled her name right.) She was very friendly and helpful when I needed help deciding on what to order. She was extremely patient with me and my endless thread of questions. She was smiling the whole time and didn't make me feel like I was being an inconvenience to her. I ended up ordering the chicken lettuce wraps, Pacific roll, and coffee creme brulee. She reccomended all these items to me and each one was truly satisfying. I ended up ordering a second order of the chicken lettuce wraps. The hoisin sauce with it made a delicious combination. She checked up on me without being overbearing and seemed more than happy to do what was needed to accomodate what I wanted. I will definitely come back with my man and be sure to have Yui as my server."}
{"text":"One of the few times ever that I left a restaurant more impressed with the service than I was with the food. Don't get me wrong, the food was amazing (the happy hour deals are the best in town) but the service was phenomenal. Christina was our server but she had a whole team buzzing about, constantly bussing our table and giving refills. I don't know if either of our drinks ever got lower than halfway gone and they sprinted (no, literally, they ran from table to table) to refill them. 

The food was great. The pork tonkatsu was tender and crispy. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough of the delicious katsu sauce for the portion size. My wife got two of the happy hour rolls-- the 007 and the Crispy Roll. They were only $5 a piece, but were huge. 8 pieces per roll and very flavorful. All-in-all, it was one of the best all-around dining experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ok first of all please note I am not a sushi fan so to be fair if I could rate it 2 1/2 stars I would. We went here as a family birthday dinner only one or two of us liked this place, everyone else was trying not to roll their eyes.
 Guess which side I was on?

  First off we wanted to change tables and they made this big deal out of it even though the place was empty. Trying to say the back room as closed so they had to ask the manager, yet there were people back there already. So that annoyed me. And that was only beginning. 

 Not being sushi groupies three of us figured we would just get the teriyaki chicken bowl, sounds easy. Well the waitress was either making pretend We wanted the more expensive dinner version, or I was simply not clear but we got the dinner one which was more money ( also asked for less sauce and got sold up to with cut chicken that isn't teriyaki for a 2.00 upcharge). And the Miso soup was disgusting and no one wanted it. The plates had a small amount of cheap white rice with some seaweed embellishment on it, two very small cold squash like vegetables, a spring mix style salad and the chicken which was dry as hell. My Cousin who doesn't eat much laughed saying we'd be hungry later. ( He's psychic!)

 They got some eel, and sushi or fish platter that was served on a huge mound of ice. there wasn't much there for the money. It looked fresh though.

We also got ribs, they were good, we ordered another lot and the next round were tough. Also got eggplant French fries these are very good but be warned eggplant in general really sucks up the grease so if that makes you wonky don't order em'.
 The drinks looked expensive but I am not an expert on that since I don't drink. My cousin got one mixed drink and it was 12.00.

 The wait staff were pretty pushy, they were friendly and attentive but obviously trying to pad or bring up the bill at any chance they got. ( which made me wonder about the \"miscommunication\" with the teriyaki bowl thing) She suggested dessert so many times I was ready to scream by the end of the meal \" No we don't want any more of your lousy food\". 

 There is a bar, and it looked nice with nice décor and seating.

They do NOT take points, I think you can get comped but they are considered separate from Southpoint and don't take any points on your casino card.

The plates, food presentation, the atmosphere, décor is not bad, This place is trying very hard to be classy or unique so kudos to them on that. I think people who like slick places and drinking and appetizer or sushi eating might love it here. I would not suggest for family dining as the menu is limited and the portions weren't too big. At least have won ton soup for people who don't like miso! In fairness some meals were not overpriced. You can eat here for 10 or less if so inclined to scan the menu for that price range, not everything was expensive. The bill was over 200 for 5 people and we got about 30 bucks worth of food. A few of us did not even order a drink.

 Honestly this place just strunk me as a tourist trap all the way, there were no lines at all when we went and it was dinner time. The Steak burger place next door had a huge line, and I thought to myself you'd think people would get sick of waiting and just try the new Zenshin place but no one was buying into it. Smart folk."}
{"text":"this place is great and the prices are good. Quality food and service. I frequent this establishment and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Service is so great here!! Food is delicious, no complaints whatsoever. Presentation is beautiful, clean place. Great all around"}
{"text":"Just tried the calamari and California roll. Calamari was very good, surprised normally no one can perfection calamari. It's thick but put some lemon and your good to go! California roll was fresh and good. Did take out and Service was great lady in front was very busy but polite and helpful!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and grilled salmon. Our waiter was great and really knowledgable about the food and gluten free options. They have GF soy sauce and a GF Japenese beer!"}
{"text":"This place seems to get better and better every time i come here. The food is always fresh, and the service is fast. What I really like is the low light ambiance of the interior of the restaurant. Also, there are AC outlets throughout the bar and on the wall by each table.....so if you need to charge your phone or work on your laptop for whatever reason. Great spot and greatly priced!!!"}
{"text":"Went during happy hour. Staff was friendly and even who I believe was the manager approached to make sure all was well. The edamame was amazing and tasteful, I recommend the Thai chili version. Chicken lettuce wraps were the favorite merely because i was looking for a light appetizer. I was disappointed with the Crunch Roll. Felt it was bland and could of been better if the shrimp had a better crunch texture along with a more fresh taste. Because this is a place for sushi and my lack of impression on the Crunch Roll, I could not find myself to rate this a 4 star."}
{"text":"Garett was great. Took our order, then things got confused. After getting our food in the wrong order ...

Our food was fabulous, the Sake flight was tasty (could have had another ) and service got a lot better. 

Oysters were great, salmon fabulous and beef tasty. Desert was to die for. Gotta try the Cream brûlée and baked ice cream. My hubby had the bread pudding and said it was fabulous!

They also gave us a Yelp discount and separate checks."}
{"text":"If you're adventurous and not from the islands of Hawaii, they serve a few 'local' favorites here,  namely oxtail soup and malasadas. It's worth a try! :)"}
{"text":"At first I didn't want to come in because it's inside a casino.  I'm so glad we decided to try it out anyways.  The miso soup and pokey tacos are unique and really good.  We ordered the spicy Mexican the ultimate shrimp and fried Philadelphia.  Each was excellent and and different from other sushi restaurants.  My 10-year-old thought the Philadelphia was crispy and Delicious.  I would come here again even if it's in a casino.  The prices are average."}
{"text":"This place is fucking terrible. Undercooked shrimp and the miso soup tastes like 3 day old fish. And the service is slow as shit."}
{"text":"I came here with friends for Happy Hour (2-6pm) before going to the movies. We had a to wait a while for a table since we couldn't sit at the bar because we had somebody under 21 with us. They finally opened another section of the restaurant and we got seated. The interior is quite nice and something I didn't expect from South Point.

Their HH menu includes: edamame, seaweed salad, kurobuta corn dogs, gyoza, garlic chicken bites, chicken lettuce wraps, karaage chicken, fried oysters, ika geso, teriyaki beef sliders, soft-shell crab sliders, salmon kama, pizza, sushi rolls, cocktails, beer and wine. Their regular menu looked promising. They have oxtail soup, for example. Since we only had a few minutes left before our movie starts, we only ordered a few things: Philadelphia roll, Spicy Tuna roll and 777 roll. I normally prefer un-Americanized sushi but for $5-6/roll, why not?

We told our server that we had a movie to catch so, our food came pretty quick. It was waiting for a table that took forever."}
{"text":"Having tried just about all of the places in Vegas that serve oxtail soup, this place, by far, was the best. I used to come here once a week with the family. Went back last night after a month or so hiatus and was sadly disappointed. The flavor was still delicious but it seems the pricing went up from $10 to $12 and the serving size diminished drastically. We used to get served a larger bowl that contained all of the oxtail you could handle in one sitting; 5+ decently sized pieces. Now the bowl is smaller and all 4 orders of the oxtail soup we ordered contained 2-3 pieces each. What used to be a meal that had you bursting at the seams, now left you yearning for more and leaving South Point still hungry. The flavor was still great but the value is now gone. Sad to say, we will not be returning. A little bummed since we only live 2 miles away. I even ran into some friends at the restaurant whom we made the recommendation to and was embarrassed at the disappointment that was served."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour (2-6) on Sunday as there are not many places offer HH on Sunday. The restaurant had a great atmosphere and the seating for HH was quite open. My mom and I ordered the Edamame, Hamachi Kama, Spring Rolls, and Lettuce Wraps. Everything was good while I am not used to eating the collar of the Hamachi so I probably wouldn't buy it again. However, I suppose it is normal to not expect much from HH as the portions are small. They weren't bite sized but small enough to force you to order a lot or leave not quite full. The sushi looked good and I regret not ordering that. But for those seeking a satisfying Happy Hour, I recommend you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 1 star because yelp doesn't allow me to give a negative star. 

How do I begin. 

Me and my fiancé have been wanting to try Zenshin for sometime now. We read the reviews and it's has a lot of really good ones. 

We decided to check it out before our movie. We showed up around 9ish and walked up to the hostess stand. The hostess was on her phone .. Maybe it was an important business call she was on so we didn't want to interrupt her. We waited and waited until I cleared my throat and at that time she put her phone down and stood there. We had to ask if there were a table available for 2 people. The place was decently busy so we didn't mind waiting for something to open up. She said it would be a 20 to 25 minute wait. As soon as she said that 2 people got up and a table opened up. We asked if that table was available and she said \"it will still be a 20 minute wait\" .. I work in the customer service industry and this place tops the cake. I could only assume they had to go to Walmart and pick up new cleaning supplies to wipe down this table. 

The hostess was very cold and not a attentive. Let's just say we ate next door at the burger place and it was just as bad.

What a shame because we really like going to the South Point for the movie theater."}
{"text":"This place is not 3 stars, the spicy tuna is made hot tasting not spicy with a good taste.  Imo I like it to have flavor not just hot.  A platter of sushi is a choice of California roll or spicy tuna and nigiri.  It was 17.00 not worth it.  Going to sushi mon so much better.   The sukiyaki was decent the beef was tender and sliced thinly so how can it not be tough.  They give you a lot of cabbage a couple of mushrooms and some yam noodles.  Not too sweet like the way I like it but decent.  
This place is probably better for happy hour which we did come during those times.  
Expensive and not very good."}
{"text":"So so good!! Everything is delish!! No kidding, think we have ordered everything and all is so good. Can't sing enough praise!"}
{"text":"BOOORING...same ol' sushi places serving up your typical sushi dishes you see everywhere else.  If you're as tired as I am of the usual, THIS is the SPOT to go with their unique an innovative dishes!!  We had a lot to eat here so forgive me for the long review.

SERVICE:
Greeted with a smile and promptly seated to accommodate our group of 6 as promised with our reservation.  The night we went was pretty busy so I would recommend a reservation ahead of time.  Our server explained all the popular dishes like they were being presented in front of a panel of judges on the the FOOD NETWORK.  Very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  On with the food!
 
FOOD:
I had to say at first thought, how great can a sushi restaurant in South Point be, I mean I see SHISHITO PEPPERS everywhere....WOW...these peppers might be the best things on the planet right now.  A perfect appetizer; their menu is much too humble.  The peppers are nice and flavorful from the grill with a miso sauce that melts in your mouth.  I could eat a hundred of these with the most authentic Japanese beer and liquor selection I have ever seen.  The TOKYO BLACK stout was especially complimenting of the meal.  And EGGPLANT FRIES nice and crunchy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. Truly a great texture experience for the palette. 
JALAPENO YELLOWTAIL sashimi; fresh as it was caught the moment we walked  into the restaurant.  Nice sizeable slices of yellowtail with a pleasant ponzu sauce.
OYSTERS on the half shell, I can't remember which ones they were, but we picked the recommended ones by the server.  Once again, I swear these guys have their own ocean in the back.  Very fresh and subtly sweet with great yuzu sauce compliments. 
DOUBLE DOWN SALMON; I do love my salmon and this roll is perfection.  combining fresh salmon with crunchy salmon skin with salmon eggs with the ailoi cuts nicely through the richness. 
The 8 SECOND BULL RIDE is truly a treat for the senses. Harmonizing the ingredients much like a surf and turf into a roll.  The beef is so tender that its like velvet.

DESSERT:
MINI MALASSADAS are addictive!  The only complaint is that they don't give me a box of them!  I suppose its their lure of getting me back into their booth. (which is working).  Next time I'll have to try their in-house made Ramen noodles."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and good atmosphere. 
Love the happy hour! Super inexpensive and great eats"}
{"text":"2pm-6pm happy hour sushi rolls for $5 ONLY!! The sushi rolls are a few but they are good. Outside of happy hour, they have rollls for only $6 and the rest are still not as expensive as what I'm used to seeing."}
{"text":"I love this place. Its a sister company of island sushi and grill. But I think their best chefs are here now. They have happy hour 4-6pm and a late night one but I can't remember the time. I think its 9-11pm. Happy hour prices are $5-6. Service is great but I might be biased cuz my bf hangs out with them. Definitely order eggplant fries. Try the oxtail curry bowl. Order poke if you love poke. Chicken karaage is great. Tempura ice cream is awesome. Skip the brownie delight because the edges will be hard. Oh and the host manager might pronounce your name wrong so if he's calling out names when you're waiting try to go up and double check."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 
- Amazing service! We had Michael (I think he was a manager), and he was very attentive, friendly, and generous. He even gave us a free tempura ice cream on our last night visiting Vegas! 

Food: 4/5 
- Food was great! I wish the happy hour portions were a little bit bigger for their prices, but other than that, I have no major complaints! 
- Come hungry, because the dinner portions were huge! My fiancé and I shared every dish in my photos, and we were stuffed! 
- If you like sweet and subtle fruity drinks, I recommend the sake sangria! It's not currently on their menu, because they're in the process of creating a new drink menu. However, if you ask for it, I'm sure they'll be able to make it for you! 

Environment: 5/5 
- I really like the convenient outlets on the booths and by the bar. 
- The environment was nice and classy. Perfect for happy hour, date night, or a family dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the sushi is amazing!  Really love the 777 roll!  The specials are amazing and its always a fun atmosphere...this is my first choice for sushi always!"}
{"text":"Zenshin has a great menu overall. I usually go during their happy hour time because they have about 20 items that are discounted. Even when I go during happy hour I end up getting items not on the list. The Ika Geso is delicious and so is their Tiger Roll!"}
{"text":"To be honest, this is the second time we came here... N for a sushi restaurant/local food joint it's subpar. The prices  are a bit high with the not so great food. This is the second time here so it's not like we didn't give it a chance."}
{"text":"First time coming here today from my cousin's recommendation and I was extremely disappointed. My cousins, brother and I were craving some sushi and ramen. My cousins told me this place was really good.

We walked in about 4 in the afternoon. We waited about 5 minutes, not too bad of a wait. As we sat down, our server got us our drinks quickly and was able to take our order immediately. My cousins ordered about 4 or 5 stuff and then my brother and I ordered: miso ramen, teriyaki pizza, crunch roll, takoyaki and a salmon nigiri. 
All of my cousins order came out first and then later my brothers teriyaki pizza came out and then my miso ramen. We were still waiting on the salmon nigiri, takoyaki, and crunch roll. 
After about 10 minutes, my cousin ordered another crunch roll because he thought it would take awhile since our order was. 5 minutes after he ordered, his crunch roll came out. We started getting very impatient, especially due to the fact almost 30 minutes has passed and we didn't get our items from our original order. It was also very aggravating that our waitress never came to see if we got all our food or to see if we were okay.

We flagged down the guy wearing a suit who we assumed is a manager. We told him we haven't gotten our full order so he told us he would go in the back and check it. Few minutes later, he said that the takoyaki and salmon were taking too long because they were doing some \"preparations\" for it and it would take about 10 to 15 minutes. Okay... so in total it would take almost 40 minutes to due prep for takoyaki and salmon nigiri??? If that was the case, why didn't our waitress say that there would be a wait so we can order something else? ALSO what preparation takes 40 minutes for salmon nigiri? Honestly think the guy was making excuses. He didn't even mention an excuse for the roll we were missing. 

Later on, our roll FINALLY came out. And the man we spoke with said that they made the salmon nigiri for me. What happened to the 10 to 15 minute prep???  The guy told us that he didnt charge for the salmon nigiri. I honestly did not care that he did but okay sure I appreciated a little bit. It amused me that our waitress never came back to even apologize to us for the inconvience or even checked to see if we needed anything else or hot tea. When we asked for our checks, she just handed it to us and walked away. No \"sorry for the wait\" or even a \"thank you.\" Okay.. What kind of service is this? I was okay after we got some of our food even though it was VERY late. But then even as we are about to leave, our server didn't care for us at all. That triggered me really hard.

This was the most unpleasant experience I've ever had. I wanted a nice lunch before I went to work but ended up in disappointment. I do know the name of our server and the manager, but I would not rather call them out. 

Also, out of everything I ordered, the crunch roll was the best. I give them the 1/2 a star for the crunch roll and 1/2 a star for the guy who somewhat helped us out."}
{"text":"Happy Hour here is the best! I love the fact that they have oxtail soup. One of my favorite dishes of all time! (Not on happy hour menu.) Hamachi Kama is always good here... Okay, I'm not gonna lie, I enjoy everything off the happy hour menu and the regular menu!!!  So many dishes to choose from!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi I've had in Vegas.  Food and service was excellent.  Definitely will be back for some more dragonfly & 777 roll."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a memorable sushi experience this may not be the place. The food while good was extremely average in execution and presentation. They do however have an excellent Japanese beer selection. I noticed the hostess sat all single people who wanted to sit at the sushi bar, in the rear of the restaurant while there were plenty of seats at the front (Not nice). Noise level was loud. Food knowledge and service was average. It seemed to be a quite night as the restaurant was only half filled.
Trying to pay took a while. I've read how other guest commented on this. 
Possibly an off Friday night?"}
{"text":"a hidden gem no doubt...Hamachi kama, 8 second bull ride, Cali roll, everything was really good and our waiter Kason did a nice job.  Im a fan and Ill be back."}
{"text":"The food and customer service is fantastic here, I usually come here after watching a movie in Southpoint and I am never disappointed. I usually get Rory as my waiter and he is a fantastic server of the restaurant, always alert and in a positive mood. A few dishes I recommend is the oxtail curry with rice and can last you up to a few days to finish since it is so massive. All their sashimi dishes are wonderful and fresh, you cant go wrong with the eggplant fries or shisito peppers. One of the main reasons I choose to watch movies at SP is because I love to dine here."}
{"text":"For anyone that enjoys Asian fusion foods, Zenshin is the benchmark to which other establishments will be measured. All it takes is one meal here and you will completely understand. From appetizers, to drinks, to entrees and desert, this is a total dining experience at the highest level. Our waitress Leslie was pleasant, knowledgeable and on top of everything. I highly recommend this establishment to everyone. Pricewise, it was less expensive than the quality suggests."}

     I've followed Chef CHRIS RECAIDO on Instagram for sometimes now www.Instagram/C_REC, Have dined at his former place SENSEI sushi inside the Marriott Hotel in Waikiki, Hawaii before. I told myself, I will visit him at Zenshin Asian Restaurant at the South Point Hotel in Las Vegas at some point.

    I come to Vegas average 6 times a year, some trip like the CES one last month, I stayed for 8 days, I finally got to visit Chef Chris Ricaido. All I can say is WOW, I'm impressed.

   If you look at their website, no where mentioned his name besides the owner and the executive chef, or their website is so dated, they even misspell the grape varietal. However, be sure to call in advance, to make sure chef Chris is in, you will be in for a real treat.

   Zenshin Asian Restaurant is spacious, you don't have that feel of a cozy Japanese restaurant. It's big and almost feels as you walk into a cafeteria. However, the oval sushi bar, makes it perfect for foodies, you can watch to chef and cooks do all their magic in front of you. Don't the look and feel of Zenshin discourage you. 

   Their HAPPY HOUR is amazing, such a great deal on cocktails and not-so-small-bites:

- Strawberry Bangkok - $6

- Rising Sun - $6

- Beers & wine - $2-$3

- Hamachi Kama - $6 Grilled Yellowtail Collar & Ponzu Sauce, the CHEAPEST in Las Vegas! Order it!

- Teriyaki Beef Sliders or Soft Shell Crab Cake Sliders - $6

- Karaage Chicken - $4.50

    Now the regular menu:

- Jalapeno Yellowtail - Hamachi, Jalapeno, Shiso, Tobiko & Truffle Ponzu - order this!

- Sizzlin' Tuna - Sizzled with Grape Seed Oil, Ginger, Chives & Truffled Soy - delish

- Teriyaki Beef - Marinated in Soy, Ginger, Garlic & Simply Grilled, simply falvorful.

- Uni with caviar, toro, tai, hamachi were all fresh and high quality fish.

- Cucumber roll with tuna, hamachi, salmon was so delicious, fresh, and it was my FAV roll, off-the-menu, but if request on a week day, chef will do it for you.

    I have met many chefs via Instagram and Twitter, Chef Chris Ricaido is 1 of the most genuine chefs, he's humbled, kind, young and very cute too!  And I probably enjoy his company a lot more because he's from Hawaii where my half broski was born and raised, what not to love about him :-)

   Service was very attentive, the price point is so CHEAP compare to everything on the main strip or San Francisco Bay Area. This is why I love to come to Vegas for food. TRUST ME, take a short cab drive to the South Point Hotel to check out Zenshin, it's a perfect sushi spot for a big group or for a family on budget.

{"text":"I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this place, but the truth is that good sushi isn't exactly scarce here, so you'll need a few other points of pride if you want to do well.  

We've been twice.  The first time was right after they opened.  We approached the hostess stand to the right (if you're standing in front of the restaurant) and the girl snarled, \"You need to put your names in over there,\" pointing to the other hostess stand to the left (basically just a counter where menus were spread out).  Okay.  Our visit that time was unremarkable - nice waiter, good food, really dead for a place that just opened.

It was the second visit this weekend that solidified my opinion.  Wouldn't ya know, we approached the \"correct\" counter this time and stood there waiting.  And waiting.  And... waiting.  A hostess approached... no, she diverted to the right-hand stand and began counting out her drawer.  After a couple minutes I cleared my throat, she looked up and said, \"Um, are you dining in?\"  I said, \"Yes, we were hoping to, but we've been standing here for almost ten minutes.\"  Not even the grace for a perfunctory apology, she grabbed two menus and stalked into the restaurant.  I assumed we were meant to follow her, so we did.  Big mistake!

We ordered two apps (garlic edamame and eggplant fries, both good) and three rolls (two of which were very good).  I don't know what to say about the third roll, a baked roll, because it never came.  We waited and waited... our waitress disappeared.  She finally showed up and we asked for the check, which of course, included the missing roll.  We explained that we didn't receive it and asked her to take it off the check.  She was embarrassed, very nice, about it, but explained that \"the first one got burned and they are trying to make you another one.\"  Really, 30 minutes after our food came out?  And no one was going to tell us unless we asked?  There were literally three other occupied tables in the restaurant.  The bartender was eating a pretzel.  It's not like it was too busy to handle the Saga of the Burned Roll.

Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"One would think to give this restaurant one star but I beg to differ especially after what we had to go through yesterday.

Okay we had to wait a minimum of thirty minutes for our table as there was a long line but not compared to the Steak n Shake next door! Next our food did not appear until after 45 minutes of seating. My brother-in-law ordered  sashimi and does that take that long to make? I noticed our neighbors got their food before us even being seated after us. Plus my sister got her soup & salad after her main dish? My sister said her soup & my mother's hot water were cold.

My dish was a chicken teriyaki bowl and it was in a deep bowl that I had to request a fork to really eat it. I enjoyed it even though the HB felt it needed more sauce. My sister's beef teriyaki was flavorful and beef so tender that I had wished I had ordered that instead?! My HB ordered the fried noodles like yakisoba as he is the pasta guy. And that tasted okay to me.

Our cute and most attentive Hawaiian waiter Rory was one of the best servers I have had in a long time. He over compensated by automatically deducting 10% off our bill
(I had a coupon plus checking in on Yelp had it too but he did it w/o me producing it.) Plus he brought us a complimentary dessert after feeling awful of our negative experience. The dessert was very much like the malasadas of Hawaii and they were yummy!!! Underneath each malasadas was some decorative custard cream but edible alongside the chocolate swirl! This was a unique dessert TDF!!!  Okay sweetness can help tremendously but excellent service by Rory (it wasn't his fault but I felt it was the cooks' fault for the delay) really made the difference yesterday.

I would come back to this restaurant on a different trip as we have many other places to try. Don't let my mixed bag experience throw you off!"}
{"text":"I've really been dreading having to write this review....

I have wanted to dine here for quite awhile, and heard that they have great Happy Hour.  So on a Sunday night, before my bowling league, I decided to stop in for some dinner.

It was pretty busy (around 5pm), but the hostess was able to seat me at the sushi bar.  I was approached immediately by a very nice server and ordered an Asahi Draught (only $2!).  I also mentioned to her that I am not a very experienced sushi eater and she offered suggestions for me.  Although I was more than ready to order some sushi, she kind of led me away from that....

I ended up starting with the chili garlic edamame ($3 I think?).  This was a large portion for one person, so definitely enough to share in the future.

I then ordered the Karaage chicken ($5) and teriyaki beef sliders ($4).  

While I was sitting there, enjoying my beer and Edamame, I saw the hostess following a gentleman who stopped by me at the bar.  I heard her telling him that she could not ask me to move - so he stood there, hovering over me.  It was extremely uncomfortable, and after a few minutes, he asked if I would be willing to move over 1 seat so that the 3 people in his party could sit there (again, awkward).  I know that this isn't the restaurant's fault, but it was weird.  I had food and drinks in front of me and I would just never ask someone to move while they are eating.

In the meantime, it took a long time for my small food order to come out.  I hadn't really noticed, but the waitress came to apologize and said that the kitchen was a bit backed up, trying to catch up on the last hour of HH.  No big deal, it came out a few minutes later.

I'll start with the sliders.  There were 2 in the order.  The meat was very dry, but overall they were tasty, especially for the price.

The karaage chicken was a HUGE disappointment.  I took 1 bite and almost threw up when it tasted (and looked like) it was raw inside.  The outside was very well done and crunchy, so I am not sure how this happened to the inside, but it was not appetizing.

My server seemed very busy and didn't ever come back to check on me.  A Manager came by awhile later to clear some plates next to me, and I told him he could also take mine.  He asked if I didn't enjoy the karaage chicken, but I didn't say anything.  I am not a complainer (although with something that could be a heatlh concern, I probably should have brought it up), and I was in a bit of a rush at this point.  I just told him that it was \"alright,\" and that I was just full.

When the server came around, I asked for my check.  She brought it back a few minutes later and mentioned that they removed the karaage chicken since I didn't like it.  I thought this was AWESOME.  I know that the chicken was only $5, and I didn't complain....but the manager recognized that most of it wasn't touched and removed it without me saying anything.  More restaurants should do this.

I gave my server the check, with my debit card immediately, but after about 10 minutes, she hadn't returned with it.  After awhile she saw me still sitting there and said \"they haven't brought your check back yet?!!\" Apparently someone else was running my card because she was busy, and they walked up right at that minute.  There doesn't seem to be very good communication with the staff - while sitting at the sushi bar, I heard many times that people had been waiting 30 minutes or more for sashimi.  Maybe they were just having a bad night altogether.

I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and 3 stars based off of how proactive the manager was, even without me saying anything.  All of the other reviews seem pretty decent, so it could have just been an off night."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more stars only because the staff and service was excellent, but there are just way too many cons that 3 stars is being generous.
Came here on a friend referral who is a local of Vegas. Remind me to call my friend later. Appears most of the locals come here for the oxtail ramen. Sounds delicious and hearty right? Negative. Oxtail was tough. You had to pierce your fork into the meat and kind of fight with it just to eat instead of it nicely peeling off the bone as it should be. Also tried out some of their HH appetizers, none really worth mentioning. The Hamachi tail was actually cooked well. Location is off the strip, inside South Point Casino. Another negative. Not well ventilated, my eyes were burning from the smoke, my poor lungs were working doubletime. Overall, I don't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"Second time here, and just like the first, initial service was quick, even got the first roll out in a few minutes. 2nd roll (simple cucumber) seems to be waiting for the cucumber to ripen??"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after a long day of traveling and wanted some Asian food that was savory and tasty. We started with the fried eggplant fries that we both thought were very good. Served with a light and tasty honey mustard sauce that compliments the eggplant wonderfully.
We were both somewhat disappointed in the two different bowls we ordered. I chose the pork and my wife one of the chicken bowls.
They were both \"ok\", nothing special. The protein was tasty but the onions on a bed of white rice didn't add much flavor.
The service was decent. Especially liked how the servers would keep refilling our water.
I would give this establishment another chance and order something different."}
{"text":"Ordered a few items from the happy hour menu before a movie. It was good, I ordered the 777 roll ,  the soft shell crab cake sliders and the crunch roll. The  sliders were very filling, and tasted fresh but lacked seasoning or flavor of some kind. Maybe a bit of sauce would have helped but regardless it was a nice presentation and overall was ok, 3/5. Both rolls were great and yummy, 4.5/5. One thing i will say that i wasn't aware of was the 3$ fee if you want to box  up your uneaten leftovers. The waitress waived it but i found that a little off putting."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the south point hotel. We actually ate here twice while staying there. The sushi is very good and it comes like the flash. You can't beat that. I had the burger also and let me tell you,  it was one of the best burgers I have had. I think it's soy sauce in the meat. Whatever special delicious sauce they used, It was amazing. I didn't really like the eggplant fries but the dipping sauce that came with them was very good. 

Everyone there was really friendly and to top it all off, you get a 10 percent coupon from yelp when you check in. The sushi was so good we went for lunch one night and came back for dinner a couple of days later. This was one of my favorite restaurants in this hotel. I don't think that you can go wrong here. It wasn't that crowded, which was nice because it allowed me and husband some time have a mini date. I definitely recommend going there if you are at south point hotel."}
{"text":"They're happy hour is great! California and other basic rolls for about $3-4 and other apps like Japanese style corn dogs, deep fried oysters, hamachi, and edamame for about $2-$6. 

I think the happy hour hour is 2pm-6pm and I suggested making an online reservation  during happy hour time because it does get kind of busy."}
{"text":"Lunch specials were awesome!  The eggplant fries are incredible!  Everything was perfectly prepared and presented and the service was top notch and friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!  Great service at the sushi bar with Executive Sushi Chef Chris R. He made great recommendations based on our tastes. Shrimp ceviche app was awesome!  Candy Cane roll was jammin'!  Loved the Dragon Fly!  Stayed at South Pointe for a tournament and went just because it was close, but definitely worth coming just for this!"}
{"text":"3 stars because my shirt ribs were semi warm when served and my fried rice was cold...yuk!!!  Maybe next time I can get some hot food....until then 3 stars"}
{"text":"Happy hours was great! Portions were small but reflected the prices. Got table right away. Server was nice and friendly. Foods were good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls are really good here. The service is extremely slow. No one was in the restaurant and it took forever to get our food. The ramen was okay but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour on a Monday night. We sat at the bar, it was pretty empty. A few sushi rolls prepared nice for the price. Crunch roll was sweet and crunchy. 777 roll was a little spicy and chewy, but delicious. Can't go wrong with the prolly roll. Ordered a pina colada and my wife ordered a lemon drop martini. I would recommend it if you wanted something to do after dinner. Walking around south point was fun."}
{"text":"Service was great

Food was underwhelming- the baked mussels were too sweet, the black cod had a chocolate sauce which was odd since cod is already pretty sweet, the ahi tacos I liked,  the teriyaki chicken was underwhelming and we asked for more sauce on the side,  and with every entree there was a plethora of rice so much so that when we packed up our left overs I felt we had enough rice for a week.  My wife and kids didnt eat much so I had to get them food afterwards. :(  and japanese food is their favorite!

The welcoming staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! I'm a local and I go as often as possible for some garlic chicken . Service is always great and we love getting hot sake and beer for some sake bombs. House salad dressing is amazing!"}
{"text":"Their rolls are amazing! Must try the 8 second bull ride (surf & turf w/ truffle essence) and the eggplant fries!! Service could be better."}
{"text":"This place had been a favorite (probably been there 20+ times).  Yesterday the restaurant wasn't busy and our table of 7 waited 20 mins for drinks.  The food order was messed up and the server argued with a friend at the table insisting he ordered a spring roll (he actually ordered the Spider Roll the waitress messed up this order as well).  Two of the sushi rolls arrived after dessert was served.  Usually this is my go to place for sushi but yesterday was exceptionally bad.  The food that we did receive was okay so I will give it another try but the service has to improve."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the way to go here for your first time. The portions are smaller but so is the price. Philadelphia roll was fresh and flavorful with avocado, salmon and cream cheese. The Crunch roll was a little plain, not crunchy and fell apart when I grabbed it with chopsticks. The lettuce wraps were delicious with little mushrooms mixed in with chicken and savory ponzu sauce. I'll work my way through the menu on my next visit, good first impression overall. Service was excellent. Managers walked by several times to make sure we were satisfied. Our glasses were always full. Plates were tactfully taken when emptied. And our server was polite, even when busy."}
{"text":"gotta say this is probably one of my favorite restaurants! I've tried almost everything on the menu, had all of the servers before and have never failed to have been satisfied with my meal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any food lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. The rolls had decent prices. No complaints! Would pass on the drinks tho."}
{"text":"I can't determine what's worse here, the service or the food? Had a waitress whom I only saw twice. Lack of enthusiasm, didn't ask us how our food was which was awful by the way. Managers walked around without saying anything to us as we waited forever for our check. Most bland oxtail soup I've ever had, saltiest udon ramen and the happy hour specials are worth those low prices all the time because they are nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review on the happy hour menu. We had a team outing here last night and decided to check this place out. We hadn't initially anticipated doing happy hour, but since we got here before the 6pm cutoff, we decided to order a majority of our meal off the menu. They have plenty of appetizers, drinks and rolls for $5 or less on the menu. We ordered a number of different things to share. I started with a Strawberry Bangkok to drink. It was pretty refreshing, nothing amazing, but good for the price. Here is a rundown of what we ate. 

Hamachi kama - Not the best yellowtail collar I've ever had, but it was a nice size portion and at only $5 I can't complain. 

Shishito peppers - A little oversauced, but the flavor was nice nonetheless. 

Candy cane roll - My favorite of the night. Flavorful and refreshing. I'd definitely order this again, despite it not being on the happy hour menu. 

777 roll - Not a fan, despite the $5 pricetag. The flavors were just off and I probably wouldn't order it again. 

Squid legs - Chewy and overcooked. Really not a fan, wouldn't recommend. 

Salmon poke - This dish was just ok, although there was a little too much sauce and it was a little vinegary. 

Eggplant fries - Second favorite dish of the night. I'm not really a fan of deep-fried food but this was light for fries. The eggplant was really tasty and well-seasoned. Skip the mayonnaise dipping sauce it's served with. It was not good. 

We tried a few desserts as well. No standouts, but mochi is always a safe bet. 

This was a 3 1/2 star experience rounded up for their happy hour value. Most of the food quality was just ok and I don't think I'd be too interested in paying full price for most of the items. Definitely a great value and worth a visit for happy hour. They accommodated our large party quite well and service was good until the end when it was time to order dessert and we couldn't find our waitress for a while."}
{"text":"No wait, moderately busy too. We had calamari for the appetizer. The flavor was wonderful. We then had 4 rolls of sushi. Some of the best sushi I've had. This restaurant was in the south point casino. The casino was awesome, too! Bowling, movies, bingo!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I split the eggplant fries and tempura California roll with a friend as an appetizer. I ordered the chicken Katsu as an entre and was very impressed. The chicken was well cooked and the asian BBQ  sauce was tasty. I wasn't expecting a lot out of an asian casino restaurant, but left satisfied with the authentic food and quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"A gem in South Las Vegas along with Michael's & the M resort. Everything about this place transports you to a different world than the South Point, and That is a good thing.

Our party of eight was whisked away to a huge round table the back where we thought we would get subpar service... That was not the case. The whole night the service was second to none. We started with drinks and right after those arrived our server asked if we would like appetizers.

We started with the classic salted edamame, then garlic chicken, and gyoza. The garlic chicken was fantastic, so much so we ordered an extra one as we were licking our finger & chopstick.  I WANT THAT SAUCE!!!!!  It was sweet & garlicky & mildly firery and so much like a crack substitute I am shocked there are not addicts waiting outside the place.  The gyoza was perfect, crisp yet tender & not slimy inside.  

For our main dishes, we were under time constraints so we opted for entrees meals which included soup & salad.  The miso soup while slightly salty for my taste was perfectly presented otherwise as was the simple salad that had such depth of flavor from the ginger vinaigrette that I could have just had a big bowl of that salad & been happy!

I ordered the tonkatsu which was served in a huge portion, was perfectly fried crisp yet Tender inside. It was served on a bed of shredded cabbage with tomatoes on the side a wedge of lemon which I did not use, and a side of Ponzu sauce.  Others in my party ordered the chicken teriyaki, glazed I a deliciously sweet & sour sauce cooked perfectly to a juicy and tender perfection, chicken katsu, Also tried to crispy tender perfection and one of the teens ordered a beef noodle bowl, full of tender moist noodle sans soup which was served in a bowl almost as big as her head!  There was a few more that I wist I had wrote down but all tasted great (we stared tastes).

Zenshin was a surprise find at the South Point Casino (my guests were staying next door at a timeshere & I was at SP) considering one of the guests wanted to go for Chinese takeout. Instead we found a fantastic place to sit down and enjoy even with the time constraints we had.  It's now a must eat every time we come to Vegas.  It's that good!  Great portion sizes.  Killer Service!!!!  

Garlic chicken on the appetizer menu...GET IT!!!!!
Bring mints!!!!

4.5 overall"}
{"text":"I ate there last night and it was pretty good. The Hawaiian roll is super yummy and the portions are reasonable. Went back today for round two. Didn't disappoint."}
