{"text":"Great rolls and good sake deal. Will definitely be back. Especially liked the lion king roll! Remember to checkin to get a slight discount."}
{"text":"This ain't no grimy AYCE sushi place where the service is non-existent and the fish is dicey at best. Now that we are working/real adults, my boyfriend and I wanted to ball out on some sushi for our date night, and Saku was the perfect place for it.   (Don't get me wrong, you won't break the bank - we're talking upper $$, not $$$ or above!)  We ordered the Lion King, Ocean Dream, Boston, and the full chef's sashimi platter which came with a colourful assortment of sashimi. I was a little surprised at the portion size for the sashimi platter given its price point, but the sashimi was rich and delicious.   The service was friendly and very fast; we sat down around 8pm, ordered at 8:05pm, and the food was on our table in ten minutes. I would've liked a little more time to chill out before diving in, but the speed must be useful when this place gets busy!   All in all, solid place with an intimate/romantic atmosphere in a vibrant area of the city. Will return!"}
{"text":"We were on holidays and this restaurant was just across where we stayed at. I love Korean food and my husband loves sushi and this restaurant has both! everything we ordered was the bomb! From tuna belly sushi to bibimbap including octopus balls, chicken udon, Korean BBQ maki. We wanted to come back the next day to try something else but it was pouring. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi for value that I've ever had. I still dream about all the things we ate here. Just wow. The pressed sushi is not like anything I've ever eat. They caramelize the top of the fish so that it tastes like the burnt part of campfire s'mores. Hard to explain but just trust me! Also had the apricot mayo raw fish dish (I forget the name) but that was also incredible. The quality of the fish at this restaurant really shines through in this dish. You won't find better, and where you might, your bill will be threefold what you'll pay here. The rolls are also very good. Get the one with cucumber on top - not usually my favourite but it was recommended and indeed it's super refreshing. You really can't go wrong with any of the speciality rolls! The service was also very good. My only complaint is that they don't have any non-alcoholic drinks, and when I asked the waitress if they could make me a liquor-free mojito, she said they will charge me the same as a boozy one. Really? Obviously I said no. But otherwise, I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality at very reasonable prices. My first time at Saku Sushi and it was on point! The service was great, the fish was fresh and delicious. Rice to fish ratio was just right. Presentation was beautiful. Fairly large portions and surprisingly honest prices. This could be my new fave sushi joint in TO.  Here's what we ordered: - Sushi, sashimi and dynamite dinner set D, came with miso soup and salad  - Uni sashimi - Sunshine or Sunrise roll  - grilled octopus (special, not on the menu) - green tea cake roll - strawberry mochi"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. Their Aburi didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I have discovered this sushi restaurant over a month ago and it is delicious, fresh and the rolls are innovative.  I love this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi, my family and I had a wonderful dinner there last weekend, food came really fast and service was excellent."}
{"text":"My fave so far in Toronto, get the saku roll and ocean dream and the sashimi special, they're amazing!! The service is always good but there was this one time when I ordered an appetizer and they never brought it.. I mentioned it after receiving our sushis and the lady apologized and brought it afterwards. they gave us a 1$ discount, which is funny because they made it sound as if it was a big deal! Also the wine and beer are good and cheap. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend based on her recommendation. It's great! Ordered two platters and the saku roll. It's really good. Nice cozy restaurant. Friendly and polite waiters. Can't wait to come back! The food is great."}
{"text":"Very good selection at a reasonable price... definitely will be back.  Rolls and aburis were really good! Look forward to trying others."}
{"text":"Pretty business for a weekend lunch. There are a few lunch combos available. We got the tempura, sushi set and lunch sake. The sake was on special and that was definitely the deal of the meal. Everything was made fresh and portion size was good. Service was prompt and quick for lunch. One of the better sushi spots on queen street in the area  for sure."}
{"text":"The sushi was absolutely amazing! Had the combo set with the dynamite roll and the Washington special roll. Both were very fresh and delicious. If you would like to share something with a friend I would suggest to order the combo as it comes with sushi, sashimi, salad and miso soup, perfect for trying out the variety that they have to offer. Also, the place was well kept, with a bar serving a various Japanese sake and soju. The prices are pretty reasonable as well given that the place seems pretty upscale and the food presentation reminded me of those upmarket sushi restaurants. Definitely try this place out if you're trying to find a place for lunch and craving sushi at the same time!"}
{"text":"Overall had an okay experience - service was nice but the wait staff didn't seem to know what certain items of food were. For example I go the fried oysters (absolutely delicious) but when I asked what type of oysters they were they had no idea.   I also have a severe avocado allergy that I spoke to our waitress about, when my sushi arrived, obviously there was avocado all over it- but from her reaction and the fact that there was no avocado on my other sushi I think this was a kitchen mistake. - really though this makes me want to give the restaurant 1 star for obvious reasons.   All in all the food was very tasty- with beautiful presentation, there was very nice decor/atmosphere, nice staff- and also  Monday $3.99 pints!"}
{"text":"We went to Saku today and found the sushi absolutely amazing. \"Fresh and taste\". Also, the staff was very friendly and polite. I will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"I went to this place as many friends told me about the assessibility and also it's well priced sushi. After arriving yesterday at around 7:40. The waitress asked me if I had a reservation. I said no, and said she was sorry. I asked how long the wait would be and she said 15 minutes. After I waited a complete hour, at 8:40 we finally got seated. If she told me it would had been more than 30 minutes I would have went to another sushi place. So after waiting an hour my expectations are higher as the food should be worth the wait. When we got seated we didn't get any cutlery, very poor service. Had to wave a waitress down as no one checked up on us until another 15 minutes.   Now for the food. The pressed sushi was average. It had a ton of dressing and mind you I've had it at Jabistro, and Kaka sushi and even if kaka sushi was a all you can eat they had better torched sushi than this. I ordered a chirashi don. It was OK I had better. Spider roll and energy rolls were also average. It was that there wasn't anything special about these rolls that made me say \"Wow, this place exceeded my expectations\". The rolls were mediocre and the taste just tasted like any other sushi place that you would pay 9 dollars for. Overall I didn't like my experience there. I guess some people wouldn't mind it but I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"First off, I would just like to say... This is probably my current favourite sushi restaurant. Everything about it was perfect from service to food to atmosphere. I had a little bit of everything from the menu. I ate the krokkoke (Japanese hashbrown) which was prob the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot). I also tried their saku special roll which was amazing and def worth a try. I also had the pressed salmon sushi which again, def worth a try and lastly I also got the full platter of sashimi. All cuts of sashimi were generous and super fresh. Their service was also quick and friendly. My date and I left this place feeling full and satisfied with a big happy smile on our faces. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I usually go to To-Ne but they were busy today. Thought I'd check this one out. Yes, it's a little pricier and the menu is limited. But food quality and presentation was bang on. Got a 10 piece chefs sashimi (super fresh & tasty), 6 piece dynamite roll (with warm rice, yum!) soup & salad for $16. I'll definitely be adding this place to my roster."}
{"text":"Thank you so much this was amazing sushi we loved it so much!!!   Black cod miso,  Washington roll and the lunch special - what an amazing deal with the sashimi salad.  Mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Quite good for Toronto standards.  Fish was fresh and and tasty and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really great rolls here. I recommend the energy and fantasia rolls. They also have really great daily specials on drinks including sake and pints of beer. The sashimi is fresh and good variety.   If I had to criticize, their choice in background music might not be the best (lots of coarse language) despite serving families.  I think they have the perfect storm for success here but they're hardly on the map yet. Need to up the marketing game but they could be the next La Carnita."}
{"text":"Great quality, good service and amazing food. One of the better sushi places downtown so far."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I called ahead for takeout, and once I got there, I wanted nothing more than to eat in because of the wonderful ambiance. The fish tasted so fresh and there wasn't too much rice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and such good value! I live in NYC and I love sushi so that's saying a fair amount. The fish quality is on par with the more pretentious higher price point places and the flavors/textures here are fantastic. We ordered a ton of food and almost ate it all. Would recommend, in order of priority: assorted aburi, Atlantic queen, flattened salmon, chef's selection A (this one doesn't come with Wasabi or soy so mix some Wasabi into your soy sauce and dab the basic fish into it a little for pop of flavor)."}
{"text":"Rolls and cocktails are their very strong suit. Rolls ars creative and well-balanced in flavor, and also presented beautifully. Their cocktails are sooooooo gooood. I have a mental crush on the bartender because he is so good with the drinks. Get the Irish Carbomb one, comes with an upside down Red Bull can, hell yeah. Tempura is decent, but nothing special. Avoid the sashimi- we ordered premium sashimi and the quality was terrrible. Not fresh."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourite sushi places in the city. Their special rolls are amazing - especially the volcano roll! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came with my hubby, baby and our good friend to fix our sushi craving. There are a vast number of sushi restos in Toronto and trying to find one that you like is NOT easy.   I was so pleasantly surprised tonight. Saku met all my expectations with regards to service, ambiance and food. Servers were quick to help, friendly and made my baby smile. Ambiance is super warm, cozy and fun. Food was delicious and fresh.   I tend to judge a place by ordering my usual favorites, uni and ikura (salmon roe). The uni at 5pcs for $18 was a hit with me and the salmon roe sushi popped and made my tastebuds dance!  The torched sushi was soooooo good and the rolls so interesting and well balanced!   I can't wait to return to try more!"}
{"text":"Very modern decor with lots of warm wood tones. I particularly liked the wooden live edge tables in the booths. The seating is very spacious and comfortable as well.  My friend and I went for dinner and shared dinner sets A and B. I think dinner set A has better value simply because you get more variety of food. Their aburi sushi is particularly noteworthy. Their fish quality is generally above AYCE level, as expected, but some species are definitely better than others. Their food presentation and naming of their special rolls is what really makes this restaurant great. Overall, Saku Sushi offers great value in terms of quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Recently discovered Saku as I work and live nearby and love it!! Great quality sushi, and the presentation is amazing for the price. In this past month I've been there four times already and as a creature of habit I always get the same thing. Try their lion king roll, Washington roll, aburi sushi, and pressed sushi, it's a must!!"}
{"text":"Well priced delicious sushi. Don't have to break the bank.  Kimchi eel bibimbap is delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Got combos A (8 piece nigiri) and B (10 piece sashimi).   Honestly, I'm not sure why this place has such high reviews. The sashimi had no flavour, and the rolls were very generic and average. They also put this garlic-flavoured oil?? on some of their fish, which made it taste weird... On the plus side, their food presentation is very nice.   The general atmosphere is trendy, but loud. Service is average, and I like how their downstairs washroom area is decorated with a bunch of classic anime movie posters (e.g. Princess Mononoke, Paprika)."}
{"text":"I'm typically not a big sushi enthusiast, but I find myself craving their vegetarian Garden roll all the time! It's the perfect combination of grilled zucchini, eggplant and tomato with crispy tempura bits, soft yam and avocado. By far the best vegetarian sushi I've ever had! The service is always great too; very attentive and polite (and not judgemental when I ask for a fork :s)"}
{"text":"Always passed by this place and wanted to try it. I went with a friend. It wasn't that busy, there was no line, possibly 3-4 tables at the time. We had to wait a while to be sat. When we got sat, it took a good 10mins for anyone to acknowledge us.  Had their Sashimi Platter Special which is chef's selection. The presentation wasn't WOW-ing.. there were only 5 different types of sashimi. There was approx. 9 pieces of just the botan ebi which wasn't even that fresh.  Their takowasabi was actually fairly decent. The amount of nori we got wasn't enough for the amount of filling they put out."}
{"text":"Recommend the Dinner A. It was so good (granted I'm an amateur sushi eater). Service was okay, nothing superior, friendly waitresses, however, kinda slow. Overall would recommend."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place and it delivered. Great quality and good value. We had the chirashi don and the sushi combo 1. Every piece of fish was a delight to eat."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have yet to come across in Toronto! The food was sooooooooooo good and so fresh, all of my raw fish was served chilled and fresh, nothing tasted frozen or stale. The rolls are a great portion size ( and beyond reasonable prices) , and presented absolutely beautiful. I went with a group of 10 people, which was a little large for the small space, but the staff handled it really well ,and all of my guests ( who all love sushi and eat it regularly) agreed it was the best they have had in tdot. The drink specials were awesome and they had a large liquor selection.I will def be returning to this place with all of my friends ! Highly recommended if you love hearty, beautifully presented and fresh rolls!!!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Wow! Another great sushi restaurant that serves torched sushi, this is a must try.   Do arrive early as the restaurant fills up very quickly. We were greeted by the server and immediately seated. I ordered an asahi beer (~$5) and an assorted torched sushi plate (~$20). Definitely worth the money as the sushi extremely fresh and tasty. Service was excellent as as well.   Would definitely come back to try the bento boxes and other dishes!"}
{"text":"Tried Aburi ($22) and Uni sushi ($8).   Aburi sushi was good value - 12 pieces in total, 8 variations! The presentation was great, and looked promising. But the sauce that the chef put in the torched sushi was overpowering and made all the sushi taste the same. It does taste good, but you would be enjoying the plating and sauce, not truly tasting the unique flavour of each fish. In fact, it's difficult to tell if the fish is indeed fresh because it's so overpowered.   Uni sushi was slightly bitter and not too fresh. Perhaps just poor luck.   Might come here to try the rolls next time, but fear that I might come back to the same feeling. Not an authentic Jap restaurant, but has great decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in toronto. I'd choose it over miku most days. The aburri (torched sushi) is great and the pressed salmon is awesome too. And 10 dollar Sapporo pitchers... Amazing"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the trendy Queen W. area where most things are overpriced. Knowing that, I was pleasantly surprised to see reasonable pricing on their menu.  If you expect top quality sushi or sashimi, you are at the wrong place.   What you should be expecting from this place are dishes made out of fresh ingredients that taste great, nice ambiance you and your date (or friends) can enjoy and pretty good service. On top of that, all the dishes are very well garnished, which makes the dining experience even more exciting.   It looks like Saku understands the target market very well and knows what to offer. You definitely get the excellent value out of what you pay here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal at Saku.  The quality of the sushi is much better than some of the other popular sushi joints along Queen West.  Saku is a little pricier, but I'm happy to pay for quality.  Came here on a Thursday night, just before 8pm, and got lucky that a table had just opened up.  Otherwise, the restaurant was full, with the exception of 2 seats at the bar.  Looking around, most people had finished eating when we arrived, so in future, I will time our visits to -830-845pm next time to be guaranteed of a table.  Service was prompt, and the kitchen turned out sushi orders very quickly, but there was a long wait for hot food (our order of gyoza, an appetizer, was in fact the last dish to arrive.)  It was nice to not only have quality sushi (particularly like the Lion King (10% off due to Yelp checkin) and the Rainbow Star pressed sushi), but also enjoy good quality stone bowl bibimbap!    Considering all the roadwork on Queen St west right now (watermain replacement, I think) and the lack of parking, I'm glad to see this place thriving.  Clearly they're doing something right and we'll return again."}
{"text":"Very good sushi in a beautiful area, everything was great. The service is a bit on the slow side but other than it's great and the prices are low for such quality. Must try!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and presentation. I ordered a sushi combo and was stuffed. Excellent service. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The freshest fish in Toronto that I've ever had, and reasonable prices to boot.  It's quite a few steps above the AYCE places, in terms of quality and service.  I have now become a regular.  The lunch sets are such a good deal!"}
{"text":"So so good. The aburi plate was amazing!"}
{"text":"This fairly new sushi joint is my secret-not-so-secret go to place for sushi. The staff are super friendly and the deals are INSANELY GOOD.. particularly considering the restaurant's location on Queen west and the quality of the food.  I always order the Chef's selection sushi which is way more food than I need but sooo good. Also, every now and then they have a uni sushi special. TO DIE FOR.   Also love that the sake is a decent price. My friends and I usually go through a few bottles."}
{"text":"Very fresh seafood and the service is great. The atmosphere of the place is good for couples or groups of friends. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was deezed af fam , imagine a yung mandem fished out a salmon QuickTime and leaned it right in front of a mandems face and sent u some. This is probably the equivelant. 5/5 fam nice job mandem"}
{"text":"Friend introduced us to this place, we went in there not expecting much, other than good time with friends.  At the price point they are offering, they impressed us! The salmon sushi pizza was great tasting, definitely our favourite!"}
{"text":"Food was very good: Island Rolls: huge portion and very tasty Uni sushi: super fresh Tofu Cheesecake: not much tofu flavour, but still a legit cheesecake   Service: Friendly, but it took a while for each dish to come."}
{"text":"Loved that they had gluten free soy sauce! Fish was very fresh and the rolls were quite big. Great atmosphere. Definitely will return"}
{"text":"I really  enjoyed my latest visit. My previous experience wasn't as pleasant but heck I decided to come in again. Though I'm not vegetarian,  my guest was and I must say the vegetarian  options were delicious."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome. The food is amazing, the servers are always really pleasant and fun. The food comes quickly even when it is busy, and it's always made properly. It has a really fun but low key atmosphere, great for a nice dinner out, and the prices are incredible especially considering how good the food is. 10/10 best sushi place in town."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Japanese restaurant in downtown Toronto. I've been here for many times!To my surprise, the food here is priced fairly reasonably! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrendous. I went there on a Saturday night, close to 8 pm. There were no spots but the hostess never asked for a name, she simply instructed us to sit on some couches near the front. People who walked in afterwards but waited at the hostess booth were seated first. Keep in mind the hostess only shows up every ten minutes (strange, I know). Seeing 6 seats clear up at the bar, I ask the server working the bar if we can have a seat. She tells me to talk to the hostess. We eventually get a table.  We never got any water. The server brought me a beer with a non-twist cap on and just leaves it on the table. I opened it using a prop. After ordering, and waiting 20 minutes, some other people sit at the table right next to us and get what should have been our sashimi within moments of being seated (we still had no food by this point). The food was great, no complaints there. The sushi was better than average, and the sashimi was amazing. The default tip option was 20% lol like really? For that?  I'd try this place again on a weeknight or afternoon because the service is what made me loathe it enough to write my first review.  Food 4/5, Service 0/5  2/5"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi joint downtown! The salmon pressed roll was DELICIOUS, melt in your mouth goodness (sometimes better than jabistro too) at a price point of 11$, what a steal. Service is good here and my other favorite is the eel fried rice!"}
{"text":"It is my favorite place:) Especially the oceandream roll was amazing and my boyfriend loved the unagi kimchi bibimbab. I've never seen this fancy bar as well."}
{"text":"THE BEST!!  I've always been a AYCE sushi type of person but you gotta spoil yourself once in a  while right? It is the highest quality of sashimi and sushi I've ever had. Their pressed sushi is the bomb! I absolutely love this place: Chill atmosphere, amazing food, and friendly staff. Highly recommended :)!"}
{"text":"what a satisfying meal! We've ordered the premium sashimi platter,  atlantic queen roll, saku special roll, and saku ceviche. Sashimi was really fresh, especially the scallops!! Taro chips that came with the ceviche was decent,  but the atlantic queen roll was to die for . Yummy yummy in my tummy!! ."}
{"text":"Solid sushi restaurant. For the price point, the quality is definitely up there. Good quality fish but I didn't get a chance to try too many rolls. But I will definitely be back in the future, which can't be said for a lot of sushi places in Toronto. For a top-notch experience without breaking the bank, Saku would fit the bill."}
{"text":"First time here, but might be the last time here! I can only said that the pressed & torched sushi tasted great and well priced, however the service was probably by far the worst in all the Japanese restaurant I have been, trust me, I have been to enough Japanese restaurants in T-dot in order for me to say this!   If it had to take 1 hour for a salmon teriyaki to come after we have to followed up with our own order, which was part of the dinner set! And now I just realized that the soup and salad that were supposed to be part of the dinner combo, which were never served either! What more do I need to say about the service there? The server didn't even know that my friend's order was missed! No side plate, no chopstick, no napkin, nothing was given until we have to ask for when 3 dishes of sushi and sashimi have brought to us and sitting there for 15 minutes! Seriously? How do u expect a good tips from the customer at the end of the dining experience like this?   It is not a big or busy restaurant, with 4 female servers working at 9pm on a Wednesday evening, service like this is definitely unacceptable!!! I sincerely suggest the owner to do something about these wait staff, maybe I'm the unlucky one to go a service like this tonight, but I am definitely disappointed especially when I have kept my hope high by coming to try this place out!   Finally, 2 starts was only given for the food and price! Nothing else!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Food came out super fast. I do not recommend ordering sweet shrimp, it's tiny and has no flavor. I have to give stars off because while they were nice enough to switch from the bar to the table for us. They just took forever to get our order and then forever to get us our check. By the end my husband and I were just annoyed. And no one bothered to give us more water."}
{"text":"I went with a girlfriend and we shared 1 appetizer and 2 rolls and we were stuffed - a happy kind of stuffed :) I will definitely come back for the amazing rolls!"}
{"text":"I like this place, I will say that this is not a place for the sushi purist though. If you come here, you come for the aburi (torched) sushi.  While the normal sashimi platters are good and the fish is of a decent quality. It just doesn't stand out amongst other similarly priced sushi restaurants.  Where Saku stands out is their aburi sushi. Delicious melt in your mouth pieces of fish with a slight smokey taste from the grilling process.  I would recommend not using soy sauce as they already sauce it with mayo(?). While it may seem off putting to some, it really adds to the creaminess of the fish and gives it the melt in your mouth feel."}
{"text":"The sushi here is so delicious. I went here last minute, no rsvp, on Valentines. Managed to get a table. I will definitely come back. The food is to die for."}
{"text":"went there on a Sunday night and they had their sake special which is Large for only $6.99 more than one can drink on a Sunday night... ordered the uni and salmon combination and it was delicious. Overall great pricing and yummy food!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Extremely tasty and VERY attentive service. I couldn't name 1 thing I didn't find delicious. We had fairly simple things, but they were very well done and tasted very fresh:  - dynamite roll - spicy tuna roll - crunchy spicy salmon roll - yam avo roll - saku roll (really unique and delicious) - pressed torched salmon roll  The ratio of rice to actual maki filling was beautiful, a lot of cheap places will pack a thick layer of rice on the outside. For the price, I thought the value was really good.  Decor and ambiance were perfect as well. Quiet and yet still buzzing with activity. Nice wood furnishings and a gorgeous bar, with leather booths.  The service was probably the best part. They served my girlfriend the TINIEST seaweed salad I've ever seen in my life. My girlfriend said she did not want to eat it as it was far too pricey for what it was. Apparently there was some mistake with the portion size and they made up for it with giving us the seaweed salad for free + a complimentary pressed torched salmon roll (which was probably my favourite roll of the night). There were no hard feelings, and the servers were extremely gracious about the whole thing.  Anyway, nothing bad to say about this place, definitely recommend! Also $4 sapporo pints? Not sure if it was a daily special, but that was great, too."}
{"text":"Why come here? The sushi. It's very good and the sushi/sashimi lunch specials are especially good for what you get. Disclosure - I go to Japan every year and my wife is Japanese. It's getting better but what still passes for sushi in Toronto makes me wonder why most are still in business. AYCE sushi is a Chinese owned restaurant buffet gone wrong. If you see Bulgogi or Kalbi on the menu, it's a Korean restaurant serving sushi. This is why I was so impressed and so was my wife when I heard the owner is actually Korean. No doubt this chef trained in Japan. Excellent fish and excellent sushi. Great job on getting it done right!"}
{"text":"So delicious. Ordered the Volcano Roll and would definitely come back for this. If you're a tuna lover, the tuna equivalent is the Lion King Roll. They also have $3.99 pints of Sapporo on tap on Mondays and Tuesdays. I LOVE that they don't play music too loudly - I could hear my partner talking and it was just awesome....!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Probably some of the best sushi I've had in Toronto. I like that they take reservations. Came here with bf for his bday (he's a sushi snob) and he loved it too.  Between the two of us, we split the A combo meant for one person and two separate rolls. We ordered just the right amount of food.   The rolls were very fresh and the rice was seasoned very well. You can taste that the fish was of great quality and never pre-frozen.   Would highly recommend and would come back."}
{"text":"For a Japanese restaurant relatively close to the Downtown Core, where you can find only either affordable but terrible sushi or supremely expensive fancy dishes, I was quite pleasantly surprised by Saku Sushi's existence. We came here on the recommendation of a friend (especially after I found out its rating on Yelp - thank you Yelpers!). The ambience was very good - I really liked the candles on the table and the visual presentation of the menu. The waitress was friendly and helpful without being intrusive, we were quickly seated and I was glad to find that the tables had a reasonable distance between one another so the restaurant felt cozy but not crowded.   The food here can't be considered cheap per say, but again given the location and service level the portions were extremely reasonable (i.e., filling). My friends and I all ordered very different things, but none of us - even the biggest eaters and the most skeptical - complained about still needing a second dinner afterwards. The bibimbap and udon dishes, though not their specialty, were up to standard (even if not outstanding). Their rolls came in huge pieces and looked delicious. I got the chief special sashimi and enjoyed every piece of it (the waitress even took the time to describe each kind of fish briefly).   I wouldn't call this restaurant the best I've ever been to or go out of my way to eat here because it seems to be missing a factor that makes it truly exceptional, but I would certainly come back and recommend it to anyone who happens to be in the area."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday with a group of girls for a bachelorette..they were able to save us seating for 10 and service was prompt and food arrived fast. As with other reviewers....food was delicious and the sashimi is fresh and on point. My girlfriends all enjoyed their meals as well..I'd return if I'm in the area:) its definitely a nice change from those lower quality ayce places uptown. For 23 dollars (cheaper than ayce) u can get their sashimi and Maki combo and I was super full without having to stuff myself..which always happens at ayce places:("}
{"text":"I've been to this sushi joint a few times since its in my neighbourhood and quite good! I love their yuzu sashimi salad, their rolls and their sparkling peach jelly sake! Must try their sparkling sake if you like ciders and such! The only thing that I ordered and did not like was the saku ceviche. It tasted like pizza sauce to me with the dried herbs and tomato in it. It just tasted weird. I regret getting it the moment I put it in my mouth. If I wanted pizza flavour I would buy pizza or pizza flavoured chips of some sort. My boyfriend also was not a fan of this dish and I dont blame him, I was expecting something a lot different. Even though I did not like that dish I would recommend this place and have and will be back again. I believe foodora delivers from this place."}
{"text":"Saku Sushi was a great experience. To be totally honest,I was not expecting much from the resturaunt. The reviews online were mixed, so it didn't seem too promising, but it is very close to my condo, and it isn't too expensive, so we decided to give it a shot.   We had the salmon ceviche, the salmon aburi, the aburi sushi platter, and the energy roll.  The salmon ceviche was quite good. The portion is generous, the mango is a nice touch, and the taro chips provide a very good neutral flavor to bring out the flavor of the fish.  The salmon aburi was delicious. It was perfectely torched, and the sauce wasn't too sweet. In terms of salmon aburi, I would rate this almost as good if not equal to the salmon aburi at Kinka Izakaya. Highly reccomended.  Next, the aburi sushi platter was great. At $22 for 12 pieces, the value is quite good for a downtown Toronto sushi restutraunt. Each piece was very good and not overly torched. Also highly reccomended.   Lastly, the energy roll was only okay. It was flavorful, but it was a bit too deep fried for my tastes. I would not get the energy again.  Overall, Saku Sushi was well-worth the money. It is not as good as Miku, but it is significantly cheaper and has a much more casual vibe. If you're looking for a good meal and are only looking to spend under $30-35/person, Saku Sushi is a good bet."}
{"text":"Delicious! Currently this is my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto! The portions and price is very reasonable  For sushi I recommend their pressed sushi. Also, the unagi bimbipop is super flavorful and tasty.  For drinks, if you never tried Hitachino Nest Beer, I highly recommend this Japanese beer to go with your meal."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a weekday during the evening, wasn't really busy.  I ordered: B. Chef's Selection of 12 PC Sashimi + House Maki.  The food was ok. The presentation look great.  However, the white tuna was still slightly frozen.  The red tuna was tough.  Judging by other review it is pretty much a hit or miss.  It was a definite a miss for me."}
{"text":"Yum. The last time we ordered Lion King (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado, potato garnish) and Volcano (shrimp tempura, avocado, spicy salmon, yam, potato garnish). The Black Dragon roll is delicious too! I'll definitely be back to try more rolls. Great decor, friendly staff. I've also done takeout."}
{"text":"Ordered aburi, chef selection combo A, and the lion king roll.  Out of the 3 different plates, the chef selection was my favourite. The profile of the fish seemed different from the generic flavour/texture/mouth feel profile that you may get at most sushi restaurants found in the GTA. For decent pricing, probably one of my favourite places when comparing quality with price. The only reason why I wouldn't give this place a 5 star is I personally don't think the sushi rice had the perfect mixture of rice vinegar and sugar, also was too soft and broke apart easily."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times. For the price point, it's good value. The sushi is of a higher quality on par with Yuzu No Hana and Jabistro. I think they changed the menu a few times and it's gotten a bit pricier but still alright. I usually get their sushi board, this way you get to try lots of different fish. I've also had their cocktails which are really good. I came here for my birthday last year and they were pretty accommodating and helped me out. Service is fairly quick, they're usually well staffed. The space itself is very nicely decorated with mostly booths, some tables and bar area. The owners/staff are Korean."}
{"text":"Need a party platter? Look no further; affordable, fresh and a great variety of sushi/sashimi! Their maki rolls are great, the seared sashimi are even better! Hard to find such an affordable  sushi platter in downtown Toronto. They also do delivery! (from Foodora) If you're craving sushi and don't want to put a huge dent in your wallet, get your sushi from Saku!"}
{"text":"Very impressive! We came here early on a Saturday evening and it wasn't too busy. We ordered a beer, soft shell crab (special), spicy tuna roll, salmon roll, and the special roll--lion king. It was all SO AMAZING!  The soft shell crab was flavorful and also came with these delicious chips. All the rolls were so fresh and beautifully prepared. The lion king was huge and tasted great. I also think this place is pretty affordable. I can't forget the decor as I loved the inside. Very nice! Overall we loved everything we ordered and plan to go back a lot!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, i love going to places where they make great vegetarian versions of sushi. Saku Sushi is one place where they did. We tried a specialty roll and a regular and they both were very tasty and unique though they were made with Avocado and Yam tempura. We had the hot sake too which was really good. The service was great and very fast."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ocean Dream sushi roll. The size was very generous and it tasted really good. My friend got the sashimi seaweed salad, which tasted very fresh but was on the salty side."}
{"text":"This place was so good!   It's a small place but plenty of room for parties of 4 or larger. We ordered a mix of things from the green dragon and red dragon roll, the octopus balls and the soft shell crab.  The sushi was SO soft and buttery and I really enjoyed it. The shell crab was good but a bit oily, and I loved the octopus rolls!! I would definitely order 2 or more of these for larger parties,  4 come on the plate. Service is friendly too! Would return if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Found it guys! I have finally found my favourite Sushi place in town, a place where you can enjoy really good sushi without burning a hole through your pocket!  I was adamant on trying this new place and took Mr. H along, soon we realized it was where the old vegan restaurant used to be. The ambiance was very cozy (not the typical minimalistic look-of-a-sushi-place), we were told they don't take reservations past 9 but fortunately the guy made an exception.   We ordered; Tuna Tataki Shasimi: This comes in a ponzu sauce and was absolutely delicious!  Salmon Tuna Ceviche: There is no lime or guacamole on this one but it was my most favourite dish. It came with a sweet sauce and the fish was so good!  Todays Special Sushi: There were six in total. Tuna, Salmon, Albacore Tuna, Shrimp, Sea Bream and another one I don't remember. I liked it but it wasn't my favourite, I thought the rice didn't have enough vinegar. I personally prefer it when it's served with some seasoning (it's not supposed to be, so that's just me) Mr. H loved it though.  Ocean Dream Roll: This roll was like biting into freshness. It was super delicious, the cucumber shavings on top gave it that freshness and it was served cold which added to the flavour.  Volcano Roll: Mr. H's least favourite but I really liked it! I was served a little warm and had yam crispy shavings on top. The roll was amazing.  We downed all of this with some really good Hot Sake. The serving size was great! It was a lot of food and unlike some really expensive places where you end up paying through your nose and leaving feeling still... a little hungry. The rolls here are huge so make sure you come with an appetite. We enjoyed the service and ambiance so much that we stayed on longer that we expected. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Saku Sushi is the best sushi place I have ever eaten at. The presentation of the food was perfect, the fish was fresh, the rice was cooked perfectly, and was much more filling than expected. Best a la carte sushi restaurant by far. Staff was super friendly, and our food came relatively quickly. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My new favourite spot. The environment give an amazing date night feel. & their sushi us absolutely delicious. I've been a numerous sushi spots around Toronto and this is my hidden gem. Book reservations in advance as it does get busier throughout the evening. Also make time for parking, behind the restaurant is a green parking lot.   I'd recommend trying out their Volcano Sushi (Prawn Tempura, Avocado, spicy Salmon, yam and potato garnish) - $12, great value and a lot of flavour. Love the texture, it's so yummy!  5/5"}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh fish! Came here for my birthday dinner and ordered the following: Uni sushi - my first time trying fresh uni! Didn't expect it to taste like this, and am not a major fan. Objectively speaking, however, the Uni here is definitely fresh! It was firm in texture, not fishy in flavour, albeit still very ocean tasting. I personally find uni too creamy and filling Sashimi full platter - SO MUCH FRESH SASHIMI. The salmon was so good, so firm and tender. Couldn't even begin to identify all the fish, but the tuna and the butter fish were also   Sushi full platter - again, the sushi was amazing! Loved the eel/unagi, but th most memorable was the shrimp/ebi. They were so sweet and delicate!!!  Aburi sushi - our least favourite. Not only was the cooked fish less flavourful, but the different sauces they placed on the nigiri overpowered the fresh flavour of the fish Quite a pricey meal, but we left comfortably satisfied and not too full!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is so highly rated. We came here around 9:00pm on Friday night. The restaurant was busy but we were able to get a seat. We ordered the chef special sashimi, volcano roll, the oshi pressed spicy salmon and the chicken karagee. We really enjoyed the sashimi. It was extremely fresh. However the rest of our choices were ok. The volcano roll was extremely saucy. The sauce overpowered the roll. I didn't care for the potato bits on top. I thought it was unusual but gave it a shot anyway. Service was decent. I would take a pass and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here opening week and thought it was ok but since then the fish quality has greatly improved. I can't remember a toronto restaurant getting better before so this is a great surprise. The toro in particular was sublime and all the fish was cut nicely and presented well. A real pleasure."}
{"text":"Definitely a go to for decent price sushi.   The only thing I would comment is some special rolls there just might be a little teeny tiny bit of too much sauce taking away the freshness of the sushi itself.   All in all, Good atmosphere and great customer service!"}
{"text":"This place was really delicious. We were a bit in a rush so we couldn't experience it to the fullest. The Karaage and The Atlantic Queen special roll was really delicious! We also got the takeout boat since we couldn't stay long enough to continue dining. The fish was fresh and I would definitely come back here with some friends. Our waitress also helped sped along the cooks so that our orders would be finished quickly even though it was very busy as well!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning with the sashimi set... I thought i was going to die. I dont know why i have to make this review any longer to get it posted. Just dont get raw fish related food here. Hopefully it was just me. I had to barf twice last night because of this. The interior was nice and the list of the menu looked amazing. But what does that matter if you get food poisoning i guess."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! It was so fresh and incredible. This is by far our favourite sushi place!"}
{"text":"The salmon avocado donburi was fresh and a steal for its price, but the premium sashimi platter just didn't deliver. Quantity of sashimi was fine but its quality was mediocre for a sushi restaurant in Toronto. Don't fall for the cheap uni - you're better off spending more at the likes of Japango and Jabistro.  I took another star off for the incredibly slow service. We arrived shortly after noon and were the third or fourth group seated, but didn't receive our order until after groups that arrived after us had left. The miso soup on the house was nice but wasn't enough to make up for an hour wait for food.  I'd like to return to try the maki and give Saku another chance, but I don't want to waste my time when there are so many sushi restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"Not as spectacular and as pricey as JaBistro, but if you're craving some high quality sushi without breaking the bank, Saku is definitely a great choice.  I would definitely recommend getting the assorted aburi sushi. it's 22 dollars for 12 pieces of torched sushi. Other notable items were the Volcano roll, Island roll and Atlantic Queen.  We also ordered the breaded oyster as it sounded interesting. Unfortunately, there was nothing exciting about this item although the sauce it came with was nice. The combination of the juices from the oyster and crusted oyster just didn't clash well together.  Good service and good sushi with a nice welcoming atmosphere, I would definitely come back for fancy a la carte sushi on a budget :)"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good casual sushi joint.  They've got a full bar too so it's the kind of place you should go if you wanna go to the bar and get drinks with friends and are also feeling kind of pekish but don't want greasy bar food and instead want sushi.   Volcano roll has a crispy potato topping. Amazing.  Their hand rolls are generous. Yum."}
{"text":"Saku Sushi is delicious and affordable!   A friend and I quickly made reservations online (for a Thursday) the day before, which was confirmed by e-mail soon after. We ordered the Creamy Korokke and Edamame to start. The Korokke came in 3 and they were delicious. We also split the Ocean Dream and Sunset special rolls, along with the avocado salmon rolls and tuna scallop rolls. All of them were great, well presented, good portions and quality fish at a great price. I liked Ocean Dream the best, it was very refreshing, especially with the cucumber on top. My friend enjoyed the Sunset the most.  The service was good, the food came promptly, much faster than we expected and well done. I definitely recommend it and I will visit again!"}
{"text":"I really liked the torched sushi roll and sushi. Very tasty and service is friendly. Price is ok. I would come again!"}
{"text":"I'm dropping my score for this place because since their opening they've significantly downsized the portions of the sashimi salads. However, this is still a pretty good spot for lunch."}
{"text":"First of this place decor is pretty fancy with leon lighting under the bar but they place is too dark for my liking.  The presentation of the sushi rolls is nicely done.  We got the Chef's selection sushi set Full set and 3 rolls - Lion King Roll, The Rockey Mountain and the Ocean dream roll.  Overall Saku serve fresh sushi with   good service.  Will come back again"}
{"text":"Honestly, this was probably one of the best sushi I've ever had. Fresh, yummy, and kinda melt in my mouth. I would highly recommend this place to you."}
{"text":"I usually go to blowfish but they closed so i was told to try Saku and i was very disappointed i broke out in rashes for one.... which has never ever happened to me before... although we got our plates fast the drinks sucked and the service here is awful. The sashimi was WARM! The avocado tempura sucked too."}
{"text":"Food was a little above average and hence the 3 star. Spicy salmon roll was too salty. Boston roll and Saku roll were good but still not as tasty as I was expecting. The premium sashimi plate was very good but came at a premium price as well. All in all, just an OK experience for me."}
{"text":"A very classy flavor of sashimi - I ordered the chef special($20), tuna tataki($11) and spicy salmon sashimi($9) - the portions are a little small but at $24/person one could feel fulfilled.   I'm just used to the spicy salmon sashimi portion in California Sushi instead of the 5pc average. Also, all salmon used was farmed and there are no other options.  Overall quite well."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite sushi restaurant. For the price and the quality, it's amazing. I take all my friends here every time we feel like a good sushi session. They have incredible special torched rolls that are pack with tons of flavour. I recommend going for the special torched rolls compared to the other regular sushi rolls you can find at any other sushi place. I've also received great service here everytime I go!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation online for 11:30am, got a confirmation email and showed up on time but they told me to wait outside in the cold for 30 minutes because the kitchen is not ready yet. The staff didn't even say sorry the entire time and it sounded like she thought it was my fault that I showed up 30 minutes too early honouring my online reservation. It was a bad experience on a cold rainy day. It was such a shame because I was really looking forward to try their food."}
{"text":"omg YUM. Coming from Los Angeles and where I have access to some of the best sushi on a daily basis, Saku Sushi is definitely a great place to get your sushi in downtown Toronto.  I was fortunate to have been staying at an Airbnb less than a mile away and was able to walk down Queen for dinner at Saku. Their combos are a great value and their individual rolls are a great bang for your buck. So so SO good. I miss you, Saku!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but the service is horrible. They used to take you to a table, now they just wave at you from very fair and you are supposed to know where to sit. They take forever to bring you menus and you are lucky if you get your order taken. We literally waited for 20 minutes just to see someone and then another 30 minutes to get our food. I have been to this place several times and I can say that the service has deteriorate with the place's popularity. I have given a few chances and wont be coming back ever again."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest sushi in all of Toronto! Me and all of my girlfriends go here on girls night, no questions asked! Great drink menu, and great rolls! I also love the ginger, I think it might be pickled? Very unique and delicious! Mix it with wasabi and you cant go wrong with the fresh sushi"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have discovered this spot downtown! We got the Lion King roll, torched salmon sushi and a sashimi platter with a bottle of sake (that tasted like makkali: one of my favourite Korean alcoholic beverage) and I couldn't have been happier!  Prices were moderate. Quality was great. Service was great!  Definitely will be returning and recommend it to any downtowner looking for a great sushi spot."}
{"text":"The décor and the ambiance here is nice. There is a lot of really nice wooden pieces - the tables, lights, they all go well band in hand.   Now for the food...!  The food is great and fresh.   We ordered dynamite rolls and Washington roll and dinner combo #1.   The service here is nice. By the entry it was super windy due to the vents but we got moved to the upper deck and it was perfect."}
{"text":"This spot was picked by my dinning companions. I was a bit skeptical already due to the middling reviews by some other yelpers I follow.  Ah well sushi spots kind of fall in the category between OK to great IMO.  This place was a bit of warning sign with a conditional yellow pass posted up front (Nov 16, 2017). Ah well decided to try it anyway. I opted for a tako wasabi starter with miso baked egg plant and a couple of rolls (black dragon and ocean). The beer list is predictable with Sapporo and Asahi represented along with a beer from Japan I wasn't familiar with. Sake list is extensive and with a bunch of options for reds and whites.  Tako wasabi was good, same goes for the egg plant.  The rolls were a mess IMO as rice texture was bit off (almost mushi)  The visual appeal is again geared towards instagram I think. The tastes were off on both rolls with dragon having a strange sweet finish.  Hmm I don't think I will revisit as 2 stars for moi."}
{"text":"had the Lion King special roll, seems to me it is very westernized Japanese food. The roll was flavorful with shrimp tempura, avo and spicy tuna. I personally prefer more traditional Japanese food."}
{"text":"Came here for a new years dinner with a few friends. Unfortunately, they got our reservation wrong but we only had to wait about 30  min and they gave us a free pitcher which was pretty nice. I'm sure they would have thrown in an app or two if we asked.   Overall pretty decent sushi. I got the chef special and the Atlantic queen split with myself and my partner and it was more than enough food for the both of us. I really enjoyed it. Their miso soup and salad were also pretty good.   Wish I knew the names of a few of the pieces in the chef special though, as some of them I had never tried before."}
{"text":"Still one of my favourite sushi restaurants! Today, I had the Chef Selection A ($24), Ocean Dream Roll ($13), and Atlantic Queen Roll ($13). I also ordered the Takoyaki ($6) and Seaweed Salad ($6) - these are appetizers that I tend to order when I come here. You can right away tell that everything is fresh and that the chefs definitely thoroughly thought out the menu because the flavours for each and every dish just compliment each other so well."}
{"text":"I came here with colleagues for a lunch at noon. Considering there was 14 of us and Saku opens at 11:30, there service was great. The food arrived quickly and our waitress was attentive. The sushi itself was good but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Would recommend to anyone who loves to eat special rolls! Must try their Baked Atlantic Queen Roll. I order their premium sashimi (salmon, uni, sake roe, scallop, sweet prawn), Extremely fresh and it's only $22! Probably won't be able to find anywhere else that provides the quality and price like theirs. Takoyaki and Creamy korroke is yummy too Definitely will come back again !  Remember to check in on YELP and you get 10% off for one special roll"}
{"text":"Great aburi platter! Wonderful presentation and tasty too. However, everything else was rather meh..."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night here and I have to say that Saku are sliding waaaay downhill fast.   I never thought that Saku was a place to go for great sushi, but the maki was fun, creative and always tasty. The service was almost always great, and the ambiance was perfect for a Friday night. It was my go- to place with one of my best friends and we visited as least once every three or four months so I guess you could say we were regulars.  To be fair, we didn't make a reservation. I usually do when it gets to be the busy dinner rush time, but my partner and I were having a wander and deciding where to eat. We were given a tiny table that I could't get my fat ass into without shoving it against the table next to us.  Once we had decided it took them a very long time come back and take our order. No one asked if we wanted a drink. We ordered the Lion King Roll, Chef's Sashimi, Meat Gyoza, Soft-Shell Crab and some Sea Roll. Also a bottle of hot sake. When the food began coming out and there was no room on the table, I asked the server if she could wait the rest of our food because there was no freaking room to eat. This was a mistake because the soft-shell crab came out cold. Now, I get that it's not soft-shell crab season and I know they are frozen, but I have to say that the presentation was far from what I'm used to seeing at Saku.  It became clear when they tried to stuff all the remaining items on the table that they are just farming people in and out. I hate this. If I only have the table for an hour, let me know this and I probably won't bother eating there. After a long day I want to unwind.  Rolls have gone from having nice, compact rice with good grain structure, to fall apart, badly cooked maki with ingredients that don't seem fresh and far less toppings on the rolls themselves. Really disappointing and actually a little bit gross. Sashimi was watery, frozen tasting and did not feature the same selection of fish as I have previously enjoyed here.  Of course, the default tip is 20% on the credit card machine. I'm a server and I always overtip. But I really resent only being presented with one default choice on the machine if the service wasn't good. Saku got some really good reviews out of the gates when they opened, but now their just riding the coattails of their previous five stars, and sliding all the way down to the gutter.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Our normal go to place for Sushi is Bazara, but this is just as good with more variety and great cocktails! The sushi is better if eaten at the restaurant, as opposed to take out."}
{"text":"Fast service didnt allay the ubiquitous \"chef sauce\" which drowned out any of the subtle notes essential to good sushi."}
{"text":"Best Bulgogi I've ever had !! Tender strips of beef mixed with rice and veggies....yum yum! This dish comes with spicy sauce on the side. Although I'm not crazy about dishes that are really spicy, I had to try it with the sauce. I'm glad I did!! It added just enough kick to take the dish to a whole new level. Delicious"}
{"text":"The freshness of the sushi is something to take note about. It's rare to find. We ordered four rolls and none of them had an outstanding flavour - they were even slightly mild and boring. The only roll that had a uniqueness to it was the lion king. The ocean dream, volcano roll and saku roll were not worth ordering. I like big, bold flavour and these simply were nothing special."}
{"text":"One of the few mid/upscale sushi places that has a cool vegetarian roll if you're looking! I believe it's called the Rocky Mountain, by the way.  I had an excellent experience here. Generally I feel that mid-tier places deliver on ambiance but often not on taste - Saku proved me wrong! I ordered the spicy crunch salmon roll (10/10 would recommend), the dynamite roll and the yam avocado roll, which came out to $22.60. The first of the three was really the winner (though the other two were great!). I love when sushi rice is warm without being overly so and I think Saku's rolls provide exactly that - really delectable, crispy rolls that are filling and not too, too expensive. 4 stars instead of 5 because I think their rice is a bit heavy in sugar as I felt extremely full 6-8 pieces in (and the maki pieces are just slightly smaller than what I would usually find elsewhere), which is surprisingly fast in my books! Otherwise, excellent experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"Saku has quickly become my favourite spot for sushi. Living on Queen West, there are a ton of sushi restaurants to choose from, however most of them are extremely sub-par. Not Saku. Aesthetically, it is very trendy. The menu is fantastic. I am particularly fond of the Energy Roll, the Crunchy Beef Roll, and the Kimchi Yaki Udon Noodles. I also absolutely LOVE Aburi sushi and they do a great job of it here (with beautiful presentation) without having to spend an arm and a leg as you do at the city's other aburi sushi restaurants (Miku, I'm looking at you). I like to go for the Chef's selection of aburi. I have yet to try any of the cocktails at Saku, but I am certainly a fan of their beer specials. Pitchers of Sapporo are regularly $17, however when I went on Thursday for lunch, they were on special for $11. The only downside to Saku is the service. They are rather inattentive. On my most recent visit there, I had to flag down and ask a server if I could order a drink and then again to order the food. Once finished, we waited forever to catch the attention of a server to order another pitcher, and an eternity to get the bill. Once the bill was dropped, no one came back to take payment and we ended up having to find them. The poor service, however, will not prevent me from returning as the food is amazing and at such great prices."}
{"text":"Everything  I mean everything  Was delicious  Our server was so helpful and actually genuinely helped us pick what to eat. She was on point with her recommendations."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been here many times for both lunch and dinner and the quality of the food and service has always been great. I have tried most of the special rolls, which are delicious! My favorite is the Ocean Dream roll which has a fresh taste. The price is reasonable and it is definitely one of the better sushi places in the area!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food is an understatement!!  Great quality & fresh ingredients with generous portions. Wonderful atmosphere & people!  It's now my go to sushi spot downtown."}
{"text":"Decent for mega big fusion rolls (think of Bazara on Ossington). Good value. Though I enjoy places like Japango for more standard but still (relatively) cheap and cheerful sushi meals, once in a while I feel naughty and want some phat rolls. Saku delivers.  Highlights:  Ocean Dream Volcano  Crunch Beef Saku"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was bustling. We ordered the Salmon Oshi Zushi (pressed sushi), Chef's Selection B (with sashimi and house maki), and the Energy Roll. Some of the sashimi in the Chef's Selection were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The rolls were also really good. Service was also decent. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My expectations and standards have really risen because of all these Japanese restuarants popping up in Toronto recently.   Pros: the sashimi here is good and the cocktails are creative and tasty.  Cons: got their roll set and felt that they add way too much sauce & seasoning(ie. Mayo), which generally overpowers everything else.  Also, they got one of my order wrong, but were quick to correct their mistake.  Overall, I guess it is a decent modern fusion take on Japanese food. Just don't come expecting authentic Japanese cusine and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place and I feel like those expectations muddled my tastebuds. The restaurant is nice and small so I recommend making a reservations because they can get busy. Service was decent - nothing extra but nothing special. We were brought to our seats, they gave us water, took our order and then gave us our bill.   Our food came and the presentation was nice but the taste of the sushi was just 'okay'. Maybe we didn't order the right items to really get the full SAKU experience.  We ordered the Energy Roll ($13), the Ocean Dream Roll ($13) and the Torched Tuna Roll ($11). They were all decent tasting. The Torched Tuna Roll was my favourite because it was the only roll that had a distinct flavour from the other rolls.  The sushi tasted really bland and didn't have any distinct flavors between the fillings and sauce. In reality, it almost tasted like AYCE quality."}
{"text":"I just waited half an hour to do a take-out order and got the wrong order. Got allllll the way home to be really disappointed that I ordered something and PAID for something much more expensive and got the wrong order and it being a cheaper order too.   The sushi is fine- average- to amazing, certainly not bad. But the service is SLOW because they are much more interested in catering to foodora delivery orders than taking care of the customers actually eating in the restaurant.   There was a girl who asked for her cheesecake TWICE and I never saw her get it in the half hour I was waiting for TWO rolls to be made.  If you order online I'm sure you'll get your food faster than if you were actually a customer in the restaurant. Just make sure they get your order right- because they certainly got mine wrong."}
{"text":"I am quite pleased with my experience here tonight. Every piece of sushi was delicious and I particularly enjoyed the torched pieces. The sashimi platter was expensive but understandable because of the nature of the selected variety. My favorite item by far was the scallop sashimi which was fresh, juicy, and tender! The volcano sushi roll was also very tasty - just the perfect amount of crunchiness to complement the rest of the roll. The soft shell crab roll, on the other hand, was only mediocre.. perhaps even subpar. The two cocktails that we ordered were decent but the one with sho chiku bai and peach schnapps tasted a little better.  Service was great throughout the night. Surprisingly though, the restaurant was rather empty on a Sunday evening during prime dinner hours.   Also, note: they hold onto their dishes and serve everything at once."}
{"text":"Delicious. Everything ordered was perfect except their uni. Service is excellent. Try everything.  Uni had a distinct taste like poop."}
{"text":"Saku was a fantastic option while we were visiting Toronto. The menu had a great variety of sushi and an extensive list of tapas, which I don't typically see at many sushi restaurants.  We opted for the Deep Fried eggplant that can with a raw salmon salad on top. The eggplant was fried perfectly, but I felt the entire dish needed a bit more flavor. Spice, salt...something.  The mixed Tempura (veggies and shrimp) was really good and also fried perfectly.   We ordered a few specialty rolls and a couple of the smaller, more basic rolls. Everything was good! The Niagara roll was the table favorite.  Our waitress was very accommodating and had great suggestions on swaps we could make to appease some of the pickier eaters.   I tried the Green-Tini, a Martini made with Vodka, Sake, Green Tea and Brown Sugar. It was a bit sweeter than I prefer but still a fun accompaniment to the meal.   Overall I thought the prices were really reasonable for the area and the quality/presentation of food."}
{"text":"Saku Sushi is a solid choice for Japanese food though it can be a bit pricier than their competitors.  Of the handful of Japanese restaurants I've been to downtown I think Saku Sushi is one of the better places.  The food quality was quite good and the service was friendly though a little slow.  We got the chefs special sushi which consisted of  12 pieces of assorted sushi for $24.  The fish was fresh there was a nice selection of fish.  The chicken karage was also very very good!  Crispy on the outside and impossibly juicy on the inside.  I highly recommend getting chicken karage (maybe to share since it was quite large).  Some other items we ordered at the table include seafood nabeyaki udon, takoyaki, chicken teriyaki, and cheesecake.  The only complaint we had was that the chicken teriyaki was quite dry.  It was a large portion but over-cooked.  Everything else was very good.  Overall I enjoyed my meal and I feel the quality is better than most other Japanese places in the area."}
{"text":"I have came here 3 times over the past year, because of the amazing Yelp rating..  I really wanted to like this place but and I have to say, each time this place manages to disappoint =( so I had to post a review. I'm not a super picky eater but certain things are just unacceptable. The first time we came we ordered Uni sashimi (sea urchin) and literally had to send back 2 times because it was extremely stale and smelled awful (for $19 I expect fresh uni plz). The next time we ordered Yaki Udon and it turned out extremely salty, when we raised the issue to the waitress she looked lost and asked us what we wanted to do.. instead of remaking it using acceptable amount of salt, they took it back and diluted the dish with more cabbage (lol).. just a terrible way of finishing off our dinner.. left with a salty taste in our months and deep disappointment.. word of advice: stick to the sushi/aburi platter since they're the only pleasant items on the menu. Sorry Saku, 3 strikes and you're out. I don't think we will ever return again."}
{"text":"Great tasting fusion but fish is not the freshest. Definitely a good place for drinks and tapas, but probably not to enjoy some fresh high quality fish."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to. The aburi is omakase-quality fish for a small fraction of the price. I will not forget this experience anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed by the value and quality of sushi here. My friend who loves japango even said she would prefer this over japango. You'll definitely get full after one roll, if you're starving though, go for a donburi or an app or another roll to share with your friends. Max I ever spend here is $20 for dinner. If it was closer to the downtown core I'd come here all the time, but Queen and Augusta isn't too far. There's also always space even if you don't make a reservation and on special occasions like Valentine's day they have special menu items."}
{"text":"Came here again and and tried the saku roll, beef roll, eggplant sashimi, and the red bean mochi dessert.   Loved the saku roll! Awesome ingredients, and it didn't require any ginger or soy sauce. Definitely flavourful enough as is. I tried one piece of the beef roll, and it was pretty good, but I liked the saku roll more.  The eggplant sashimi was ok. There was salsa on it which I didn't enjoy, so I ate the sashimi separately (yum). The mochi dessert was interesting, but I don't think I'd order it again.  Great place to eat overall."}
{"text":"Tried Saku sushi for lunch using the Ritual app. I ordered the Boston roll. I thought this roll would have tobiko around it like other Boston rolls that I've tried. This one had fried fish on top instead. It was pretty good, but didn't travel well. I think I'll stick to classic rolls instead next time."}
{"text":"Was asked to sit at the bar since I was by myself. No tv or wifi so staring at the bottles of alcohol was very entertaining.  Tried to order Salmon Avocado Donburi only to be told that they don't have Uni on a Friday night. Not sure when they will have it if not today.   Then ordered Dragon and Spider. Both rolls overpowered with the flavor of the sauce. If I can't taste anything but the sauce, then it is bad. The Spider roll was covered in two different sauces and the soft shell crab tasted really burnt. They also added imitation crab meat to it which is the first time I have seen this. Fake crab meat with real crab?   Once finished, waited for awhile to get the check. Waitresses were always around since I was at the bar but making drinks or filing up water. I tipped 15% as the service was normal and nothing spectacular. Their default is 20% which is absurd when you should expect service on par to it. The waitress was very unhappy with my tip as she gave me a nasty look. You didn't have to refill my water, you were never around to make small talk, and didn't provide a service to warrant the 20%. Plus, providing a negative expression to the customer is the most obvious thing not to do.  Maybe the service will be better and they will have food that I wanted to enjoy and experience but your negative response to 5% less tip is better off trying to ask if there is anything that can be improved. When you do the bare minimum, you are lucky to get a 15% tip."}
{"text":"Never got to try it. Yelp says open until 11:30.  So we drove all the way from the airport after our flight and  when we arrived at 11:05 the doors were open but they told us closed. Try somewhere else Toronto. Thanks"}
{"text":"Since yelp wouldn't give a half star i am rating this place as 3.5/5 and my review can only be based on sushi delivery.  Decided to try this place out via foodora. Read and saw alot of good reviews from this place. We ordered a couple of special rolls.Lion King roll, ocean dream roll, chefs special full sushi set and the salmon roll.  The Lion King roll and Ocean dream roll was flavourful but I find a little over use in mayo. By the time the rolls were delivered to our place, the presentation was broken (because foodora deliveries come in bikes!) The rice was also warm, which in my opinion is a nono when you want to go for good sushi. The Chefs special full sushi set came with about 12 pc sushi and a 6 pc maki. Very standard but the quality is a little bit better than other local favourites like sushi on bloor and etc. Price is a little bit on the pricier side though...   I don't think I would order from them for delivery again but wouldn't mind going in and trying their in person service."}
{"text":"I got the Saku Roll which contained tuna, scallop, coriander, cucumber, and jalapeño.  L ordered the Energy Roll which contained prawn tempura, avocado, spicy tuna, and unagi.  D's Volcano Roll contained prawn tempura, avocado, spicy salmon, yam, and potato garnish.  The rolls were absolutely gorgeous when paired together in the low light restaurant and were decently priced with eight rolls in each one.  I liked the size of the rolls; not too big and definitely you were able to fit one entirely into your mouth if you didn't have too many toppings on your roll.  I liked the Saku Roll.  It was creamy and slightly mushy.  I think the mushiness was due to the rice.  I didn't taste too much of the scallop which was really the main reason for me ordering this roll -- I wanted scallop in my sushi roll!  I liked the sliver of jalapeño on top of the roll that gave it some extra heat.  I tried one roll each of the Energy Roll and the Volcano Roll and thought they were both tasty too.  D really, really enjoyed her Volcano Roll.  Similar to the Saku Roll, I didn't think that the spicy salmon nor the spicy tuna were very apparent in the Volcano and Energy Rolls respectively though.  I did like the prawn tempura in the Volcano Roll.   The Daily Special Sashimi Platter was smaller than I imagined but for $11 was a really good price for amazingly fresh and delicious sashimi.  We all especially liked the salmon sashimi for its fatty cut and smoothness and the hamachi was incredibly soft and melted in your mouth when you ate it."}
{"text":"*GREAT SUSHI ON QUEEN WEST*  This isn't just another sushi restaurant on Queen W. These guys are opening with a bang! 10% off ALL special rolls, $3.50 pints of Sapporo, and if you check-in you receive a free Tempura Ball.   I loved the decor of the place. It was like a nice night out with prices that you would regularly pay at a hole-in-the-wall sushi place. The servers were wonderful and on top of topping up our tea. We ordered 2 pints of Sapporo, the VOLCANO and SPIDER rolls which tasted fantastic and the presentation was nice, and we also ordered BREADED OYSTERS with Garlic Mayo and it was probably my favourite!  To be picky, the only thing I wish it had was spicier wasabi and a better bottle for the soy sauce. It was difficult to come out of the bottle. Altogether it came out to $50 with tax and tip.   We highly recommend this place is you're looking for a new sushi joint to try out. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We both ordered the selection A chef's selection of assorted sushi with maki but our salad never came. The rice in the sushi tasted heavily of vinegar which overpowered the fish completely. Needless to say I never even bothered finishing my plate. The only good thing to say was about their cocktails which was decent. Also, our waitress turned and left before we even finished ordering my date's cocktail and we had to hail her down again. Never seen such poor service and attitude from a waitress before. This is my second time here and neither time managed to impress me. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know if this place is good eats... my friend and I were seated quickly with menus, but never ever served. ..no eye contact. .nothing.  We obviously left due to the fact that we weren't going to get dinner if we stayed. On my way out, I said to the host - bartender \"I guess you were too busy to serve us\".. he just said \"oh...uh...\"  wow! They weren't even busy. Thumbs down.... I am typing this as I eat my complimentary salad in I Love Sushi. WAY better service there."}
{"text":"As per the title, that's how unhappy I am with today's meal.   I've been here a few times now. Their food is always good. The problem that I have with this place however, is their inconsistent service. It tends to vary by the waitress.  Sometimes the service is excellent. Sometimes it's horrible.   Unfortunately today I ran into one of the not so great waitresses.   I ordered my regular, the Chef's Special sushi, and I received something that I've never seen before. The waitress insisted that I was the one who \"ordered wrong\", and refused to change my order.   Upon asking if I could pay extra to have this dish modified into my regular, she sulkily took my plate away and very obviously complained to the others of this incident, resulting in all of the waitresses treating us with the same terrible attitude.   Plates were removed rudely before the food was finished, and requests were answered reluctantly.   I don't understand why such a simple matter of changing the plate (into something that I actually ordered), can be met with such hostility?   Finally after the bill was paid, the waitresses all purposely refused eye contact, and did not acknowledge us as we were leaving.   I left deeply unsatisfied. Even though I love their food, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Saku has been on my bookmarked list for quite some time now. And finally my friends and I were able to go try it out today. We made a reservation just in case Saku would be busy, but surprisingly it wasn't packed when we got there.   We had a little trouble deciding on what to order, but based on yelp reviews :p we ended up ordering lion King, ocean, volcano, energy and the chef selection A. I know...that's quite a lot for four people but we were starving! Three of us also ordered drinks, I had the momo - I don't remember what was in it but it was too sweet for me. My friend had the Tokyo Rose and the other got the sparkling jelly sake - recommend!   Our rolls and sushi came within a reasonable amount of time. And everything was SO delicious! We were not disappointed at all! And our server was so nice, she had no problems splitting the bills. I'd definitely come back, it's a great place for dinner and date nights ;)! Don't forget to check in for 10% off a roll."}
{"text":"I wanna give this place 5 stars, but the person who took my New Year's resolution failed hard. Got my name, time and phone number wrong. So when we got there our table wasn't ready. They were however kind enough to provide a free pitcher of beer while we wait. Service there in general is just okay.   Overall food quality is fantastic and is indeed the highlight of the restaurant. Sashimi and rolls were tasty and fresh. Loved loved the Sushi Pizza! We split the kimchi noodles which I would pass on.   I would definitely go back and would change to a 5 star rating if I get the same quality of food and better service."}
{"text":"Awesome and fresh sushi, cool decor, and playing Tribe Called Quest. What could be better? The sushi was amazing, I got the C - Sushi Sashimi combo and it was delicious. Will be back next time!"}
{"text":"We decided to pop into the first sushi place we saw while walking downtown, and made it in time for the lunch special. This location is quite modern with modern music as well as a chic interior. The lunch menu includes several options, one of which my boyfriend and I decided was perfect which was the always affordable sushi roll set. It came with a California roll, spicy Salmon roll, and I believe crab, all 6 pieces each. It was more than filling and we could've easily split just one order. Everything was very fresh and tasted great.  The only negative aspect is the service. I was actually surprised at the ambivalence and even borderline animosity from the staff. It was so surprisingly bad that I would not recommend going to this place for that reason alone."}
{"text":"A solid choice for those looking for affordable, quality sushi.   With their focus on specialty sushi rolls and torched pressed sushi, this is by no means an \"authentic\" sushi restaurant. However, their specialty rolls are creative with a good rice to fish ratio and the standard rolls are very solid (love the spicy salmon and negi hamachi rolls). I've also tried their yaki udon & rice dishes - also great options!   I usually order the sashimi sample or chef special sashimi which were great the first few times but I found that the value has decreased (less pieces, smaller cut and lower quality selections). Perhaps a la carte sashimi would be a better option."}
{"text":"Go to spot for great sushi at a reasonable price. The location isn't the most central which is probably why the price is good. Highly recommend the volcano roll and the whole soft shell crab if they have it!"}
{"text":"Finally! A go-to spot for good and affordable sushi in Toronto. It's so hard to find a solid mid-tier sushi place downtown as I find the city either has:  1. Unworthy AYCE restaurants compared to the suburbs  2. Upscale, fancy and pricey Japanese establishments  3. Mediocre/below-average joints with questionable levels of freshness  But Saku is such a welcome addition! I was initially excited about this place because it's essentially the rebirth of the original Hub Sushi in Thornhill which I absolutely loved but heard it had fallen apart after new management came in. From what I remember, the menu has largely remained the same although the Special Dinner for 2 (best value) is not offered.  The vibe of Saku is very trendy and hipster. All the elements for a place on Queen Street West. There is seating along the bar and everything else is booths so it's nice and intimate. Music isn't too loud which is great to come and unwind, have a date or catch up with friends.  For 2, we ordered the Lion King Roll, Volcano Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll and Red Tuna Tartare w/ Baked Chip. Be warned that their special rolls are not your typical maki rolls. Its definitely fusion and not just purely fresh fish wrapped with seaweed and rice. They play around with the texture and flavor with the help of various toppings and lots of their chef' special sauce.   Lion King ($11) and Volcano ($11) - Rice is warm, rolls are soft (albeit slightly smaller than I had expected) and the components just work so perfectly together as it all melts in your mouth. SO good. I liked the Volcano (prawn tempura, avocado, spicy salmon topped with yam chips) a little more since it was easier to eat without the shredded stuff but the Lion King (prawn tempura, spicy tuna, avocado and green onion) was pretty similar in taste.  These rolls have a good and bad to them. On one hand, it's delicious but on the other, you know deep down you're not really eating sushi anymore. The salmon or tuna gets lost under all that sauce and really goes unappreciated.  But! The spicy salmon roll ($6) was prepared and presented more traditionally and proved that Saku is capable of serving fresh, well-made sushi. Rice ratio was on point. I look forward to trying their pressed sushi, nigiri and sashimi next time.   My only complaint is the Red Tuna Tartare w/ Baked Chip ($13). Avocado was creamy, tuna was fatty but the tartare was just so bland! I wish it had some zest to it to give it a sweet, slightly sour taste or any flavor for that matter. The chips didn't complement it well either. The dish had so much potential but just didn't deliver.  Positive experience overall. Without a doubt, I'd come back to Saku (although I think Hub was better)."}
{"text":"Seriously good sushi in the fashion district. The aburi plate is a must try - for $22 you get a variety of torched sushi. I also had the island roll and the energy roll, both are lightly torched and tasted fantastic. The ceviche starter is a great fusion dish that blends South American and Asian flavours - citrusy, creamy, and fresh.   Great alternative to the high end sushi restaurants like Miku or JaBistro. Solid sushi restaurant in the downtown core, give this place a shot when you want to have some quality sushi without the high price you would have to pay at some of the high end places."}
{"text":"I had consulted Yelp prior to visiting and was pleasantly surprised by Saku.  Why? It was pretty delicious sushi given the location and price point.  I had the assorted aburi and friend ordered 2 special rolls.  The sushi was aesthetically pleasing and service was fast and quite friendly.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, the place is run by Koreans!   Will definitely be returning for dinner and even lunch!"}
{"text":"Tried the torched sushi, delicious.... And also the seaweed salad,  love it!  Unfortunately the rice is not as sticky as standard rice used for sushi,  thus when I used the chopsticks to picked up the sushi,  the rice was easily fallen apart.... Hope their chef will fix that  The service is good too :)"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for an early dinner after work. I like the ambience and decor a lot. The booths are cozy and intimate. The menu is big with lots of selection. Fish was fresh. Come with friends so you can share lots of things! They have a full bar too and drink menu.   One star off because the bathroom was down these steep narrow steps in the basement and it smelled like faeces in the whole downstairs bathroom area."}
{"text":"Miku is hefty on the price, and less on the portions when it comes to Aburi sushi, but Saku is definitely a contender if you're looking for a cheaper alternative. Came here for the Salmon and Tuna Aburi special, and while it was still fairly delicious - there was a bit too much mayo for me (so I recommend asking them to lighten their hand on the mayo beforehand).   But the chef's selection of Aburi sushi was definitely a highlight for me. The dish was beautiful and each piece was just as delicious as the last. It might not be the best dish for sharing since each sushi is unique. But if you and your date doesn't mind, I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Second time in this restaurant and for sure best sushi in the city!  Fair prices for good and fresh quality of rolls. Would recommend it to whoever is looking for a good sushi night.  Ordered the lion king and hot sake."}
{"text":"Saku is always my go to sushi restaurant! It is always fresh and beautifully presented with very reasonable price. Love the atmosphere and interior of the place. I have been here many times and my favourite is the Lunch Combo A ($13) which includes 8 pieces of sushi and a dynamite roll. If you happen to miss out on lunch time (only weekday for lunch), then I recommend the assorted aburi sushi ($22)! The aburi set consist of 12 beautifully torched sushi that melts in your mouth. The service was good consistently as well!"}
{"text":"We finished our dinner in less than 35 minutes. Everything came out hella quick. This is my first time having sushi in 8 months and I had beyond high expectations (higher than the CN tower). The food wasn't bad it wouldn't say it was super fresh but for that price it was decent. We made a reservation but I really don't think you need to, there are more than enough seats. I wish the servers were more friendly, they were too focused on speed and was rushing everything. Oh also we ordered a spicy tuna sushi pizza, my friend and I didn't even taste the tuna all we tasted was rice. I actually think he forgot about the tuna lol."}
{"text":"Just had another super meal here. Sushi is melt in your mouth excellent. Also nice vibe and great music all at a price that won't kill you. Check it out"}
{"text":"The aburi sushi is so good. So is the pressed salmon. Really good prices too. Went twice when I was on Toronto. Fast service too"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. I've been here a couple of times and I always try something new because everything looks/smells amazing. The ambience is here is tight and cozy, so you sit really close to other parties but I don't mind because their food on the table makes me want what they're having! Not only the food is great, the hospitality and environment seems so non-stressful and happy from both BOH & FOH- it's like they're one big family. I recommend the speciality rolls, get anything with their in house potato garnish.  Remember to post on instagram to get $1 sakura mochi!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and excellent service! I've been here a few times and have tried both their lunch and dinner menus which are both great. Definitely recommend it if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"So fresh! The sashimi is totally worth the price! Aburi is about average level, but the sashimi is shining!"}
{"text":"The chairs are a bit worn down. Usually don't need a reservation for a few people. We were a party of two and seated right away on Saturday evening. The portions are big. We got the kimchi udon & it was the delicious. We got the sake flight and also Sushi. Food was good and we would go again. Bathrooms could use a makeover."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and the restaurant was pretty quiet. Being fans of AYCE sushi, this was a new experience for us. We ordered udon noodle soup (included a poached egg which was a nice surprise), torched sushi maki (salmon), black dragon roll and a red dragon roll (I think). Everything came out pretty good time wise.   Pros: -You can share all of your dishes with another person -You will leave full  -Everything tasted pretty good  Cons: -Menu has no pictures to refer to -No number of pcs for certain menu items -Would have been nice to have gotten a little bowl of miso soup or a small salad as an appetizer -No boat / preset options (only if you're ordering takeout) -Pretty pricey  Not sure if I can say we'll be back - only because we have our favourite sushi places that we tend to stick to. It was nice to try somewhere new, we just didn't find anything that was a super standout by them."}
{"text":"The restaurant came up as brand new in the area that I usually frequent. I gathered a group of friends together and purchased a coupon deal to help with the meal. Based on the website, the restaurant recently moved from uptown where I use to hangout before I moved downtown.  There were daily specials for food as well as cocktails for $8 from 4 to 7 pm. If you see uni (sea urchin) on the menu, make sure you order it as it is only available in limited quantities. Our group ordered the uni ikura don, soft shell crab, crunch beef roll, and the sashimi platter. The best of the meal was the platter with lots of variety of fresh sashimi. The uni ikura don was amazing and we were lucky to order the last one of the day.  Definitely will be back to try other goodies even if the coupon deal has ended. There are many other dishes that I wanted to try including the fried oysters and many rolls that others have raved about. The prices are reasonable without the coupon given the quality of food that you are served. Although I did not drink that night, the restaurant was offering a large hot sake for $5 with an order of a specific roll (i.e. Boston special roll)."}
{"text":"This was so beautiful. I came for my birthday.   The inside was a little squishy but I guess you could call it intimate, which was excellent.   We ordered the aburi assorted sushi and Atlantic queen roll. Aburi was so good, it's exactly like the pictures! We had two people, and they gave two of each piece to us except the unagi and shrimp pieces. The meat was thick but the rice fell apart too easily, and I am not the type to dunk my sushi in soy sauce. Literally when I picked it up with chopsticks, it fell apart. I had to fish out the rice from my soy sauce dish.   Atlantic queen was huge! The salmon on top was juicy, but again, the rice was a problem. This time, the rice stuck to the plate and we had to crowbar that sushi off. Other than that, it tasted great and I would love to come here again! I would just order aburi because that was my fav. It was fresh and the variety really made the dish interesting."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi restaurant downtown. I live in the city and there's literally a sushi restaurant or two down every block. This is my favourite for many reasons: 1. It's is well priced and relatively inexpensive for its quality and selection. 2. The service is always super fast! 3. It's actually tasty!  Give this place a try. It's a great neighbourhood spot and you'll probably catch me there on a Sunday."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Saku Shi on a regular basis for about 2 years now. Must-try: torched sushi and daily sashimi - they're delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Saku yesterday for a Mon-date with the BF after work. I arrived before him and was asked at the door if I had a reservation, to which I said no. 2 minutes pass and realized the restaurant was about 2/3 full. She had split a 4 person table for us and sat us down in the middle of three 2-person tables. The waitress was friendly and placed some water down and asked if I would like anything else to drink. BF arrived and we ordered the edamame as an app and 3 special rolls : Saku, Energy, and Atlantic Queen.   What I'm about to say may come as a surprise but must be said: the quality of this place has gone down. The first time I came here and ordered one of the sushi sets here - that was fantastic. The sushi was fresh and everything we ordered was tasty. My return visit however, was just alright. I don't think I'll return for these reasons: 1. the rolls this time were poorly made..rice was mushy, and the presentation was sloppy 2. there wasn't anything different between the taste of the rolls - it was fish, sauce and rice  =( I really wanted to love you again Saku, I really did...*sniff  Our bill came to ~$25 a person with 3 rolls, edamame and a pint of Sapporo and the Yelp check-in special - I pointed out to the waitress that Sapporo was on special for Monday and she corrected the mistake on our bill."}
{"text":"Food: Not bad, but not good. I don't want to compare this with other places, but their sushi is not that good honestly.   Price: Bit high. Good for group dinner, but I'd not go back.  Service: One of the worst in Toronto. It was."}
{"text":"Large rolls, really good prices, huge wins on a few rolls and pretty standard stuff for the others. Lion King and Volcano rolls, crazy good. Big, packed full of fish, crunchy toppings, dreaming about it all day at work. Yuzu Roll nada. Didn't like the super fishy taste -- and not like a sashimi taste, I love sashimi -- but just this sort of taste I wasn't feeling. Maybe it's the kind of fish or something. The spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls were good, nothing out of the ordinary from anywhere else. Better than most sushi joints. Did a pick up order real quick but the interior looked cool. Only knock was the whole 10% off check in special thing.  Asked if I really wanted another 10% off because take out orders apparently get 10% off anyway.  I do generally, like in life, enjoy paying 90% of my total bill instead of the full 100%. But it seemed like that wasn't an option after all.  All good, Sunday night, new restaurant, he was prob tired as hell after serving customers all weekend, but maybe take off the whole check-in offer deal on Yelp? Great sushi rolls.  Lion King and Volcano.  Win"}
{"text":"Great spot for a birthday dinner with the parents! What I like about this place is that there's standard fare (sashimi, maki rolls, bento boxes, noodles, miso soup, tea) but then there's some really great specialty rolls, fun cocktails, and even stuff like seared sashimi with jelly. I just wish the service was a bit better - we weren't checked up on enough and often had to ask to be served. It was pretty busy so make sure to make reservations!   We ordered: Sashimi sampler  Mango Avocado Salad - lots of avocado and mango Seared Tuna Sashimi - so yummy! Grilled Eggplant - DELICIOUS Miso Soup Atlantic Queen special roll - amazing! Lion King special roll Black dragon special roll Saku roll - this was OKAY  Everything was really good (saku roll was only okay), and we were all full. We also ordered 3 drinks  - everything came to 31$ or 32$ per person, which is pretty decent for a birthday dinner if you think about it. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome special rolls! I'm seriously impressed by this place and it was just as good as yelpers are making it out to be. You will definitely leave happy and satisfied with their special rolls which are the melt-in-your mouth kind of delicious at a great price.  We stuck with the special rolls because they were so well-priced, not saying the other items on the menu didn't sound good but since everyone has been raving about the rolls, we decided to try them and ordered the ocean dream, lion king, and boston special rolls. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. I really like their menu overall, there's a grest selection of things and I will definitely be back to taste the rest  The rolls were delicate, and everything just worked perfectly together. They also don't skimp out on ingredients either. They all taste fresh and there's actually a good amount of fish inside AND outside and for once you can actually taste the prawn/shrimp tempura in a special roll, which is a rare phenomenon I find. Oh, and there's that  sweet, yellow 'chef special sauce' which seems to make everything taste even better. The ocean dream roll was a pleasant surprise, the cucumber on top seems to add a lot more 'freshness' that you would think! The boston roll was a semi-cooked one and was all warm and delicious. Underneath that cooked salmon, there lies raw salmon, I wasn't expecting multiple layers at all.   Atmosphere was trendy and service was great. All in all, this is place is wonderful and you should definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Perfect for dates! I had the assorted aburi and it was quite filling. Even the salads here were a little more high end. I got the diced salmon with seaweed salad, something that you wouldn't normally get with other run of the mill Japanese restaurants. Definitely some of the best sushi I've ever had."}
{"text":"A long day in Toronto... and you head to a sushi bar looking for good nigiri. You order off the menu, and you are thrilled that you are going to end your day with the crisp, saline creaminess of fresh uni. Then ten minutes (!) later the waitress comes back to crush your dreams. They are out of uni. And didn't tell you. Not ok."}
{"text":"The appetizers were really disappointing and I was afraid the meal was going to be a write off but we were really delight by their sushi rolls, shashimi and sushi. For $6 you get four thin slices of tasteless tofu the was made without any thought. The seaweed salad appetizer could not decide what type of salad it was. There were seaweed, carrots, cucumber and arugula in the salad. Sorry but when I order seaweed salad I want just seaweed. The seaweed tasted fine but I was totally confused by the thought process that went into that salad. The assorted tempura was less than inspired. It tasted flat, was not presented well and was not the light crispy delight you expect. I was also disappointed crushed ice was put in my plum wine. Please use cubed ice in the future. The mains were exquisite though. Beautifully presented, fresh glistening fish, delicious and they really saved the day for me. We had the Lion king, ocean dream and sunset rolls. We also had the chef special sushi and shashimi. They were so good it made up for all the ill will the appetizers caused. Overall, the prices were reasonable, service was good and the ambiance OK but I found the stall we sat in a bit tight and uncomfortable. I will definitely return but no more appetizers for me."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night to get some drinks and fill a sushi craving. Really nice atmosphere but there weren't any tables left so we sat at the bar.   We both ordered the teriyaki combos. The teriyaki, salad and miso soup were alright but the rolls we got were amazing!   Food was good, service was good, no major complaints! 4/5"}
{"text":"Discovered this gem a month ago and casual sushi night has never been the same! High quality sushi AND great price point is a rare combo and Saku really raised the bar here.  On Queen street just west of Spadina, they opened up a few months ago and already I have lost count how many times I've visited. I was beyond excited to recognize the same owners as my previous fav sushi spot Hub Sushi before they changed ownership half a year ago.  Dinner set A is a must try. For $21 you get 12 piece sushi and 6 piece maki. The sushi spread is no joke, there is an impressive range of various types of tuna, yellowtail, salmon and even flame torched sushi. Fish is super fresh, at the perfect temperature and the rice is high quality Japanese rice - moist and fluffy. I did not know 20 bucks could go this far with sushi downtown.  For rolls I'm a fan of the Ocean Dream ($11) special roll with tuna, salmon, avocado, cucumber, fish eggs. Freshness explosion in your mouth! 10% on a special roll with yelp checkin is definitely a bonus.   As expected, they are getting busier and busier so would suggest making a reservation. Lately I've been recommending Saku left and right to family and friends and they all come back with the same verdict - love this place!"}
{"text":"Again, wanted to try this place after the great yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. We got the sushi,sashimi ,and chicken teriyaki set. They all came with making rolls which were big and delicious. The chicken teriyaki was not bad but can pass on it, but the sushi and sashimi were fresh and delicious! For a Japanese place in downtown Toronto, they're a great value: portions are big, great selection of fresh and special fish (not all of your typical salmon and tuna), and thick sashimi!  We also got the lion king and ocean dream rolls.. both were really good and we already talked about coming back to try other rolls. For dessert they have $1 mochis if you upload a pic of their food on Instagram or Facebook, which we did. Their mochis are special..they come in a lead and the mochis are pink and you can almost taste grains of rice used to make the mochis,filled with red bean paste...give it a try."}
{"text":"Saku's unagi don is glorious.   Generous fillets of tender unagi basted with sweet teriyaki sauce on a bed of steamy sushi rice (known as \"shari\"). The rice is of superb quality and Saku does such a good job in preparing it as well. Each pellet retains its distinct individual identity and is perfectly vinegared to give just a hint of sweetness. The unagi meat seriously melts in your mouth. Tbh, I was a puddle of happiness.  In my experience to date, this is the only restaurant that lavishly uses unagi. Huge stamp of approval on Saku's rice/unagi ratio. Bravo! Well worth the $17.00. Perfect combo of value and quality.  SPECIAL NOTE: Avoid making reservations online. Call them to ensure you get a spot - especially if you're considering coming here with a large group. 416 368 7258."}
{"text":"My go-to Sushi place downtown. Always great service and the sushi is fresh and so good. The salmon carpaccio and saku ceviche are sooooo good. I could eat 4 servings of it! The miso eggplant is so well done and a great veggie option. The volcano and saku roll are my top faves frm the raw ones. The yaki udon is so flavourful. Salmon pressed sushi is also good. I'm not a huge fan of pressed sushi but Saku does it really well. The assorted Aburi sushi is the thing to go. You get an assortment of sushi and all really well done. It can tend to get busy so try to make reservations if you can. Prices are pretty reasonable for the quality and freshness."}
{"text":"Losing my mind! This place is so damn good!!! Big time recommend this place. I know sushi, and this place is amazing every time! The Aburi combo, is a must! Please trust me!!! AmaIng sushi but they had a chair that had a random nail poking out and it ripped my tights. So upset but they handled it like pros. They reimbursed me for the nylons. I couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi with a modern touch. This restaurant does sushi really well. The fish is so fresh and that's the most important aspect of good quality sushi. The butterfish was the best out of the bunch! The chefs maki is salmon, tuna, avocado and tobiko, and is soo tasty. The miso soup and salad served with the combos are nothing to rave about and the only thing that needed a bit of work is more attentive service when you sit down. Other than those minor things, I will be coming back for more for sure! The atmosphere is very nice, i like the booths. Its also a great place if you dont want to be too full from an AYCE, the combos for one are the perfect portion."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 star but service was so off that I'm giving it 2 stars. I went during a Friday evening and called ahead to make reservations for just myself and a friend. We were dining for the first time here. Staff on the phone said they don't take any reservations and it's only walk in basis only. Understanding that, I went in expecting some wait since it was during the time the after work crowd comes in. So like 6-7pm?   Came in and found only bar area available. Interior is nice, with wood furnishings everywhere and it was quite packed as expected. Wanted to wait for a booth and they said it was a 40 minute wait. Decided to wait at the bar in the meantime. Imagine my surprise when I see a table clearing and ask the staff if I could get that table, that it was reserved! I told the staff that's strange cause I just called a few hours to make reservations and someone told me I couldn't. I don't have a problem with waiting especially since I knew going in they were busy. However, I was pretty annoyed and unimpressed that someone on their staff would actually lie to a customer. Maybe they are doing it as a tactic so they can take more walk ins and avoid last minute cancellations or maybe staff I spoke to was just having a bad day. Either way, no excuse to lie to a customer and I said so to the staff. They were kinda panicking and talking in Korean amongst themselves (I understand a little so I could catch a few words of \"what to do?\" Etc). In the end I got the booth cause I think the ppl who reserved were late or something.    If it was just this, I would probably not review them so badly but my first impression of this place was not great and does not improve after. Continuously through the night my friend and I had to always flag down a server to get any service. It's busy, I get that but no one even checked up on us. We had to always ask for water, refills, or if we wanted to order other menu items.   Sushi was good, I will give you that but the service makes it a turn off. If you go, just try speciality rolls. Yelp check-in gives you a little discount. Will I come back? Not sure, there are plenty of other sushi options out there."}
{"text":"Great vibe and decor, does not feel like your typical sushi restaurant.  I loved the Salmon Oshi Zushi.  I have never seen anything like on menu in Toronto and liked the fact that it was small bites.  The $5 draught beer was awesome too!!  I will go back to this place for sure  Did not care for the loud music, trying to catch up with my bestie and the loud rap music did not suit the mood!"}
{"text":"I've been here about half a dozen times since it's opening. I almost don't want to post this review because I want this restaurant to retain it's obscurity so I don't have to wait :)   But the secret's out. This is the best sushi spot in the downtown core. It's my goto from now on. Amazing special rolls and moderately priced. They've stepped up the sushi game in ways that other joints should've a long time ago. I recommend their Volcano Roll and their Fantasia Roll. If you're more traditional, try their Sushi platter.   Everytime my girlfriend I come here, we leave happy and wanting more! Seriously so happy to see a place that has not only amazing sushi, but amazing service. For some reason, this cuisine seems to have one or the other. The staff here is so nice and super fast. Can't speak highly enough. They don't even need this review. They know they're amazing. Just hope their prices and staff stay the same. Consistency here is key."}
{"text":"2/5   I heard good things about this modern Japanese restaurant. So I was quite excited to check this place out. However it was real let down. We got very thin slice of mediocre quality tasteless sashimi and extremely mushy over cooked rice filed with tiny amount of fish filling stuffed inside. Rolls were big but had not much of flavour. They have some interesting list of cocktails and it wasn't as bad as their food. Overall food was extremely over priced for what they served and service was okay at the best. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Saku has quickly become my go-to sushi delivery (via Foodora). Their party platters are great. The best items in my opinion are sashimi, nigiri, and SIMPLE rolls (i.e. salmon avocado). Their fish is very fresh and even tastes good the next day!? I don't love their spicy salmon roll, special rolls (too much sauce), or pressed sushi (prefer Miku or Jabistro). I also always add on an order of beef udon - even if you're not an udon person normally, YOU WILL LOVE THIS. It is perfectly chewy with flavourful and tender beef pieces."}
{"text":"This place is is underrated! My SO brought me for a date and we both loved it. We got the Dinner B and a couple of rolls, including the Saku roll, all of which were presented beautifully and were delicious. I think this place is such a gem because it offers you a break from the stuff they churn out at AYCE but doesn't have you break the bank for some better sushi like JaBistro would.  The atmosphere and service was also quite good, all in all a very good experience and shall hope to be back."}
{"text":"My new go to sushi restaurant in the area. The restaurant replaces a vegetarian place, where they've kept the decor in place.  Saku offers the best value on their menu - even when you go with their \"tapas\", they always give a lot of sashimi and rice which is sometimes enough food as an entree. I've also had the sushi and sashimi combo which comes with great quality fish. Any dish that comes with their salmon roe is also recommended.   After having been here with my friends and family, everyone had left pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"Saku is a great sushi restaurant. I am always skeptical of sushi restaurants because they typically ride on the easy to please North American taste for sushi.  I ordered the lunch special that came with 6 dynamite rolls and 8 assorted sushi.   Saku's rice was cooked PERFECTLY 10/10.   Dynamite rolls are predictable rolls that are hard to screw up. Nevertheless, these were quite tasty, and I enjoyed them.  I really loved the assorted sushi. It was a chef's assortment. I think I had two types of salmon (one seared, the other regular), sweet shrimp, sea bream, red snapper, and two others that I can't remember. All the fish was extremely fresh, unbelievably tender, and cut expertly.  I would go back 100%. This is one of 2 sushi restaurants in the GTA that I trust."}
{"text":"I'm giving this spot 4 stars because the service and quality of fish was great. The atmosphere, not so much. I popped in for the lunch hour. Loud hip hop music to no doubt appeal to the college crowd, not bad but not chill. If you looking for a quick, delish spot, this is it. If you want the relaxed vibe for a lunch meeting or an intimate dinner, might want to keep looking."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner here tonight. No reservation but they found us a table. Attentive service. Delicious sashimi and tempura. Hip atmosphere. Very good seaweed salad and miso soup. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. Terrible service and mediocre food. I went there for late lunch and I believe it was our server's first day at work. That and some terrible attitude she displayed. But, lets back up.  First the menu does not have pictures, which is strange for a Japanese restaurant, especially that they are using original names for their rolls. If a \"Dynamite\" roll is the same everywhere, using an original name should come with a picture, a description, or at least a knowledgeable server. This was not the case here. I asked the server which roll is the most popular. After rolling her eyes, she answered that \"all rolls are popular.\" I consider this to be the condescending version of \"I have no idea.\" Anyways, I chose Ocean Dream and I asked how is it made. The answer: \"It is written there.\" My follow up: \"So the salmon and tuna are mixed inside the roll?\" Answer: \"Yes.\" I am skipping some more eye rolling and some \"What do you mean 'how it is made'?\" questions. Well, after receiving the food, I realized that salmon was not inside the roll, the tuna was not red tuna as I was told, and, all in all, it was a roll that I didn't enjoy. Maybe if they get their act together and hire some    knowledgeable and polite servers, I might go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Good but not outstanding in anyway. Oh wait, they have many nice booths which is comfy.   Ocean dream roll: 4.5/5. The thin cucumber slices on the top are zesty and refreshing, which goes well with the fish they pair with.  Lion king roll: 3.8/5. Personally not impressed.   Bulgogi bibimbap: 3/5. Overall too sweet which is a hit or miss. Could use more vegetables and less meat. Also the hot sauce is bland to me had to ask for extra Siracha. But since this is a Japanese restaurant so it doesn't matter much."}
{"text":"Best sushi that I had in a long time. I ordered the energy roll for $12. It  was fresh, warm, and flavourful. It did not need any soya sauce. Presentation was great and appealing.   Comparing to other sushi places the price is quite comparable considering the quality of food you get. Definitely one order of a special roll was more than enough for me.   Restaurant ambiance was quite nice and modern. Food took a bit long to come but other than that there is nothing bad I would say about this restaurant and it's food. Would Definitely come back and try more from its menu."}
{"text":"Saku is a casual sushi restaurant in Queen West area. Upon entering is a bar and not a sushi bar. My first impression is that this restaurant is more casual and loud than a traditional sushi restaurant.   Service: Waiters replenished the water bottle when we were almost done. The food however came out slowly. Service was adequate overall.   Food:   Energy roll- this was really bold in flavor. However it was a bit too heavy with the unagi tempura on top. I probably wouldn't this order again.   Chef special sashimi - this was an assorted 12piece sashimi platter. This was great ! Portions were great for the price of $20. I would definitely recommend this as you get a sampler of different sashimi.   Oshi (tuna) - this had a lot of sauce on top. So much it covered the tuna sashimi completely and there wasn't much sashimi. Very bold in flavor with the sauce but I wished there was more tuna on it.   Overall I think Saku is a great sushi joint given it's portions and prices. Would definitely return when I'm nearby."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good sushi for a decent price. it's either top tier splurge, or AYCE bang for your buck Saku Sushi is a good middle ground.   I've been here twice and really enjoy the Saku Roll and the sashimi platter. The Tuna is nice and tender, and not chewy like many other places in the city. The Service is also very good. they're very attentive and not hard to flag down.  Forget the AYCE sushi places where 90% of the make is rice, and the slices of fish or thin and pathetic. spend a few more dollars here. it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good. Fish was fresh but they put some garnish that had strong taste. It ruined the flavour of fish. They were playing loud gang hip hop music. I found it bit odd for this kind of restaurant to play such music. It killed the mood for the anniversary dinner with my husband. Waitresses aren't very attentive. We just wanted to get out after our meal because of the music but it took a while to get the attention from one of the waitresses."}
{"text":"The absolute best bulgogi bibimbop I've ever had! And they serve delicious poke bowls as their special!   My family and I stopped in for lunch right when they opened, 11:30am, to an empty house. However, when we were done at around 12:30, the place was packed full of patrons waiting for takeout and being seated! So I definitely recommend coming in as soon as they open.   Even though my family was the only table, our food took a little while to arrive, but for good reason! Our dishes were absolutely BEAUTIFUL, and tasted wonderful. Around our table was hot stone bibimbop, poke bowl, salmon teriyaki and a volcano roll. Nothing was short of fantastic! I especially loved the bibimbop, the bulgogi was sliced so thin, and marinated so well that you didn't even need a sauce unless you wanted a spicy kick. It had the perfect amount of veggies, it didn't compensate for a lack of protein at all, there was plenty of bulgogi to be eaten in every bite.   This restaurant's ambience is very nice and cozy. Perfect for a small dinner with friends or a date. It also looks to have a full bar, and a huge sake selection! I would love to come back for dinner and drinks next time I visit Toronto, but I must warn that the stairs down to the washrooms in the basement are a little rickety and steep, so it would be a challenge after drinks lol. The bathrooms themselves are super beautiful though!"}
{"text":"Seems like the West Coast torched sushi train has finally arrived here in the East. First claimed to fame somewhere out in the Vancouver area (or so I've read somewhere) this stuff has set ablaze the sushi food culture as of late. For all you new age folks in fear of consuming raw fish tainted with mercury, lead, worms...etc -- this may just be your calling.   Our moment here was brief; cut short only by the ridiculously uncomfortable chairs (yes, they are THAT uncomfy I had to mention it. LOL). These chairs bring back childhood memories of your parents screaming at you to sit straight as a pole at the dinner table. That aside the food was alright. I can't comment too much on the freshness of the sushi as it was...well torched but I am going to assume that it is pretty good. What did disappoint was the lack of balance and mouthfeel. My sushi was very oily and I can see why. Torching mayo causes it to melt, releasing it's glorious oils (yes, mayo is made of about 75% oil hence why it's so delicious!). The oiliness combined with a heavy serving of mayo really made the dish quite delicious in a sinful kind of way. However, ultimately you don't really taste anything else; especially the fish. The sushi rice really did disappoint, it was quite novice in it's approach. A little soggy, clumpy and almost \"wet\" in some areas.  I do have to commend them though for the good service and excellent decor (tastefully done by their forebearers -- a former chic bar in this space). I also think they offer great value for their relatively low prices.  So for the purist, I would say this may not be your thing however for the ones seeking to break away from the traditions this is your calling. As for the rest of us, it's worth a visit if you are in the area and really craving for some affordable fishy thrills."}
{"text":"Great sushi and sashimi. It took quite a time to wait for the food but our food is really delicious. Defenitelt come back here again!"}
{"text":"4 stars for great food. Sushi was fresh and delicious. Atmosphere was modern and clean. Docked one star for mediocre service. Overall, would recommend to friends and return."}
{"text":"Saku Sushi was quite awesome! It was better than I expected! I here for the first time yesterday with a friend for her birthday and we got the Ocean dream roll x 2, black dragon roll, and Spider roll. The sushi was definetly beautifully  plated/presented, and the ingredients tasted really fresh!  Rolls were between 11 and 16 bucks each, 8 decent sized pieces per roll."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. It's not like mind-blowing or anything, and it's definitely fusion, not purist sushi. But it's tasty, it's fresh, it's well made, and it's pretty cheap! We were looking for redirect sushi, as we were still craving it after the bad sushi we returned at Shio http://www.yelp.com/biz_share/hb96UNwF1bvkueiXDsfe8A/review/CR_H8UnHT6lABIeuRmMhpA, we needed to eat some better sushi! We ordered the Volcano, Energy, and Island rolls, thinking we were just getting started. Three rolls here is a ton of food - the rolls are huge. We ate all three and the server actually told us it was impressive for us to finish them! At $12 per roll, this is a great deal.   Very Important: I advise that you absolutely DO NOT come here for date night - I had food all over my face the whole time I was here. It's impossible to eat rolls this big and look cute. Lucky for me we had just seen Star Wars and my love was too dreamy and geeked out to even notice the food on my face. ;p  If you are looking for \"real\" or \"authentic\" sushi, go to JaBistro or Japango. If you are hangry or drunk or it's late or you just need a bite - go here. It's good. And it's a pile of food for the price."}
{"text":"In terms of affordability and quality, this is definitely my top choice for a la carte sushi in downtown Toronto. They have such an extensive menu and everything my friends and I ordered was absolutely delicious and presented beautifully. I was surprised at how quickly the food was served yet how fresh and visually pleasing it all looked! They also have different drink specials such as $15 for a pitcher of Sapporo. I would recommend this place for anyone that loves sushi but doesn't care to spend a huge amount on it."}
{"text":"Gorgeous place and food to match!   When I walked into the restaurant, I took a moment to take in the decor; the place is a combination of vintage chic with nightlife vibes. The hostess seated us right away and the service was friendly throughout.   We ordered a lot of food there was one dish that stood out for me:  - Lobster King Sushi Roll:: You better come hungry for this bad boy! Made with lobster, cooked salmon, avocado, asparagus, and yam, this roll is huge and delicious. The sauce was lovely and the roll itself made you want to dig in immediately!  I will be back to check out the rest of the goodies! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh quality and very reasonably priced sushi for the quality and portions you get. We got the Dinner Combo C with 8 sushi and 8 sashimi for $21. We also got 2 special rolls: Energy and Lion King; plus the BC Tuna Torched Pressed Sushi. Everything was very fresh and the sushi melted in your mouth. The tuna belly was very fresh and presentation for everything was great. I was really satisfied with my meal and can definitely see myself coming here many more times. The service was also very good, everyone was very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great rolls and super fresh sushi! The atmosphere is more on the trendy side than a real Japanese feel. It's a little hard to find on  Queen street. But wort a second try. I wish the tables weren't so close together or small. It was hard to fit all the food with the big decorative stone plates they use."}
{"text":"Food quality is good. Their seafood soup was at great tempered but could use more seafood. It's kind of disappointing they claim to not accept American Express as a payment method."}
{"text":"Came here two nights in a row while visiting Toronto for work. Great servers, food and drinks . This is the legit Sushi spot to come to. Atmosphere is what you want . Not outside setting however . Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Saku is new to the neighbourhood and we couldn't be happier. Amazing food at reasonable prices. This was our 3rd or 4th time eating here and every time they've been on point! The Saku roll is fantastic and the sashimi is the freshest!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants in town. When I want quality sushi that won't break the wallet, this is always my go to spot. The price quality can't be beat and I often order delivery on foodora as well. I've had a variety of items here - all sashimi and nigiri are solid and most of the rolls are good too (some a bit too saucy). I'd advise against the miso eggplant and softshell crab though. They also have a uni, salmon and salmon roe bowl that's limited quantity."}
{"text":"Our most favourite place for sushi. I personally don't eat fish sushi, but my husband swears it's the best he's ever had. The vegetarian and meat (beef/chicken) sushi is soooooo good, beef crunch roll is astonishingly delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience overall. Extensive menu featuring apps, special rolls, sashimi, rice/noodles. The interior is sort of upscale casual like Nome.   Korokke - was feeling potatoes that night so got this order of croquettes. As my sister describes, it's like hashbrowns. Creamy potato with corn inside. Not bad but could use more sauce (rosemary mayo in the description - couldn't taste it)  Aburi Sushi - 12 pcs, variety of salmon, white fish, shrimp, 1 pcs beef, 1 pcs eel. Thin fish but overall combination of rice & sauce was good. Could actually taste the 'torched' flavour.  Tuna Tataki - messy presentation but good, thick-cut tuna with ponzu sauce and julienned cucumber."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner and I find it to be pretty consistent in quality. It's pricier than many other spots and I don't know that it's justified...I'm not sure either if I'd return should I have a sushi craving on Queen West.   The atmosphere is very hip and trendy and it gets packed quickly but still feels cozy and quaint. There are low hanging lights up at the front bar and the lighting is dim throughout. One thing I noticed was that there are a lot of booth-style seats in here.  Recommendations from a regular (not me): volcano roll, unagi kimchi bibimbap and salmon pressed sushi.  I recommend coming in a group and sharing - my friends and I split the bibimbap, the volcano roll (roll topped with spicy salmon) and salmon pressed sushi (torched and not bad but I've had better) and it came up to about $15 pp which is very reasonable, unlike my previous visit.   We came on a Friday night and it got pretty busy. Throughout our meal, we got the sense that the waiters were too busy/trying to rush us out.   2.5/5"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Go hard or go home when you come here.   I got the chef sushi spread (omakase style) and was not disappointed. The sushi stood along without needing soy or any other flavoring.   The service from the servers was bad. I had to go to the counter for everything.   Cool anime wallpapers on the way down to the washroom so check it out :)"}
{"text":"Update: they have a new chef or something, the quality of the rolls/sushi went downhill big time. I might stop coming here altogether unless they improve soon.     The special rolls (island), fantasia, energy, etc, are amazing.  Their lunch special are lackluster, small portions, and overpriced.  Go for the special rolls!"}
{"text":"Really like this new place! It wasn't too small like most of the Japanese restaurants in town. The sushi and sashimi quality was good, without it being too expensive. The lobster roll was excellent :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday around 8:30pm. We were hoping to have dinner at Rock Lobster but regrettably they closed and I yelped this restaurant. I saw the positive reviews and was so excited to try their sushi. We entered the restaurant and were greeted immediately. She mentioned that we could sit anywhere but all the tables we uncleared and grabbed a table by the kitchen. The first thing I noticed was the temperature difference, it was much warmer closer to the kitchen than the bar. Perhaps, that could be due to the warmth from the kitchen. We then waited 10-15 minutes before getting a place setting for my boyfriend and menus. The waitress walked pass us several time and I wasn't sure why we weren't being served. We then ordered dinner set A and D and asked for tea. Our first server forgot our tea. I then saw other guests being walked to their tables, being seated and asked for their drink order. I wasn't sure why we weren't getting the same attention, maybe those guests were frequent visitors. Our food and tea arrived quickly but it wasn't anything special. Their rolls were sloppy but their torched sushi was decent. My sashimi had a fishy taste and I didn't finish my portion. Overall, this restaurant is located in such a great neighbourhood and was very modern inside however with the poor service I received, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We order a lot of food and we tried their gyoza, crunch beef rolls, California roll, salmon roll, chef's special sushi and sashimi dinner special. They were all good. Overall experience was pretty good and service was not too bad either."}
{"text":"The prices are very reasonable and portions are very big (even the rolls were huge). I am a sucker for aburi sushi, so this hit the spot.  A group of 10 of us came in on a Friday night. Being completely starved and not having lunch that day, I wanted to order everything on the menu. we shared a few items. I loved how the soft shelled crab was served with lotus root and the rolls were all very creative and seared.  My friend had made reservations for 6:45pm, however the restaurant elected to tell us that the table was reserved for another group at 8:00pm. If we had known we would have selected a different restaurant. We were fine with it however the food came out extremely slow, as well they gave us dirty looks when we wanted to order more as we were very close to the 8:00 cut off time. On top of that, they kept reminding us throughout the hour and fifteen minutes that the table needs to be cleared by 8:00pm, pretty much pushing us out when we weren't done eating.   Summary, food was great, service was not"}
{"text":"Blown away by that Lobster King roll, time and time again. Well priced, great quality for what you get. Not the typical sushi joint. I've come back to this place with friends 5-6 times. Staff could be a little friendlier or more attentive, but I didn't have any seriously bad experiences with the service so not really a fault. Must try in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. The restaurant was not busy and got a table right away. The food was excellent. We ordered a lion king roll, a volcano roll and a spicy crunchy salmon roll. The special rolls were incredible and very tasty. The spicy salmon was very good as well. There was a lot of salmon inside. I'd like to try something new next time I go but everything I had was so good that I'll want to order it again. Oh well, guess I'll just have to come with more people. :)  Definitely my new favourite spot for a la carte sushi in the area."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and being a frequent (weekly or more) sushi-devourer I can't always afford the cream of the crop sushi restaurants around the city.  So for good quality food at a reasonable price, Saku is my go-to.  The menu includes the usual maki rolls such as red tuna, spicy salmon and dynamite; a really good aburi platter (although JaBistro's aburi is still my favourite); salads; fusion foods such as tuna ceviche and carpaccio; and warm Japanese fare including beef yaki udon.  Their wakame salad is a refreshing twist on the typical wakame-in-a-bowl that you get at most sushi restaurants.  The yaki udon (both beef yaki udon and seafood nabeyaki udon) are delicious comfort foods.  But I have to say that by far my favourite items on the menu are the raw special rolls.   I can't say enough about these rolls!  Picture a maki roll on steroids!  It's basically a roll filled with fish, topped with more fish, and garnished with added flavour.  Drool-worthy!  They range from $12-$13 and they are definitely the best bang for your buck.  I personally am satisfied after one of these, but somehow I always make room for more :)  The ambience at Saku Sushi is pleasant.  It's not too loud, which is very conducive to lunch/dinner conversation, and the restaurant is clean.  The layout is good for a Queen St W venue with a fair amount of seating.  There is a decent amount of natural light coming in if you're near the mid/front of the restaurant, but it's a little bit dim if you sit further back.  The staff is also very pleasant and attentive.   This place is great value, good quality and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My favourite sushi restaurant. The service is awesome. They have an amazing selection of fish. My husband and I absolutely lovvveeeeeee this place"}
{"text":"Really excellent sushi! Chefs special is great, a good value and tasted awesome. Fine cocktails, great selection of sake. Service is friendly but a bit scattered sometimes. Overall would definitely make it a regular of mine."}
{"text":"I was in downtown Toronto for the day and In the mood for sushi so went on yelp for the reviews of the best places around.  For the budget this seemed to make the most sense and the place was highly reviewed.  I wasn't impressed by the service or the food.  I would try to find another place for sushi in the city."}
{"text":"Where to begin with this jewel of a sushi joint?   First of all the atmosphere, and the entire ambience of the shop had this very cool hip vibe the moment me and my friends came here on a Friday night, we immediately got drinks and that's where the fun began.   After a few drinks and about 15-20 or so minutes the food came and my god I don't know if it was me being tipsy, hungry or both but the food was great!   Great choice for a downtown eat, very clean place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I am floored. What a gem, a fantastic meal, and a spot we'll definitely come back to over and over again. And did I mention the awesome sushi?!  Super trendy, contemporary, very cool vibe, intimate and romantic - but still a really casual feel - I loved this place. We visited on a Friday evening (we called ahead and made reservations - don't worry if the phone number takes you to a weird Rogers personal voicemail, it's okay to leave a message - they'll get it and reserve your table! ;)), and the place was packed on a Friday - space is a little narrow, but it's intimate without being too constricting.   First, parking. We managed to snag free side street parking along Augusta Avenue just east of the restaurant.   Second, 'check in' on Yelp. As of the date of this review, you get 10% off any special roll (our sweet waitress made sure it came off the more expensive roll).  Third, the food. We ordered: a) the Rockey Mountain (yam, avocado and a really crispy sweet potato garnish - basically the veggie version of the Green Dragon without the prawn tempura, which I unfortunately can't have because of my shellfish allergy - $11.00), b) the Crunchy Spicy Salmon Roll - $6.00, and c) the Crunch Beef (yam, avocado, sliced marinated beef, and crunchy tempura bits - $10.00).  The rolls were a godsend. Also, portion size is pretty generous! I absolutely loved the different textures that came with the rolls we ordered - it's something you don't experience too often at other sushi joints. Crispy, crunchy, the rice was soft and warm, the ingredients tasted so incredibly fresh - everything came together perfectly, and they obviously put a lot of effort into plating and presentation. But there was substance to those looks - what we had was absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced.  What an awesome experience. We'll be back. For two people, with tax, and tip, we paid around $34.00."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, fast, and friendly staff!  I wish I made a reservation but bar was fine.   We will return again for sure! Great value!"}
{"text":"Went here on a triple date and here are my thoughts:  Crowd: young professional Atmosphere: hip, modern and intimate Presentation and Sushi were phenomenal! Price range was very reasonable as well.  Can't say much about drinks as I'm not an alcohol consumer, but they do have this one interesting beer drink that you consume with a shot of tequila lol.  No severe reactions from my friends from that experience.  Would recommend this spot for meet ups/ dates.  Good food + Good vibes"}
{"text":"I came here while visiting Toronto for a few days back in March. I loved their sushi! I ordered the Chef's Selection and it was worth the price and more. I couldn't even finish it. I am from New York so these prices are more than affordable for the quality of the sushi they serve. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the service leaves much to be desired. I will definitely come back if I visit Toronto again!"}
{"text":"I've had been here a few times and the food is great. Sushi is always fresh which is good. And they have specials during lunch time where some of their menu items are at have price."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite place for a la carte sushi!  For it's price, quality and taste, there's nothing else on the market in Toronto right now that serving sushi as amazing as this. The amount of friends I've brought to Saku has been ridiculous as each time I visit, I bring someone new with me.   When you're at Saku, make sure to try the torched pressed salmon/tuna rolls, Saku roll, Energy roll and Ocean dream roll. For apps, I strongly recommend their sushi pizza, takoyaki and karaage. Also, for mains, please try unagi kimchi fried rice. That is most underrated item on the menu. Absolutely delicious!   Service could be better, however, with food this great you will honestly forget about the service!   Japango, Jabistro and Yasu are great quality sushi but for it's price, not everyone can dine on that sort of budget. Saku is a MUST try for sushi lovers in Toronto who enjoys an amazing meal at an unbeatable price."}
{"text":"Short Review:  I was on the hunt for excellent sushi, and found just ok sushi. Although they are friendly, they rush you out of there. Oh, and remember those AMEX commercials in the 70's? Well, leave home without it, cause you can't use it here!  Long Review: So I figured in downtown Toronto you should be able to get excellent sushi. I mean, right? Its fricken downtown Toronto - a tourist trap at the least! Well, so I go searching...on Yelp of course. I always rely on my fellow Yelpers...until now.   The pictures on Yelp made this place look amazing, so I tried it. Got a nice Kirin Ichiban bottle of beer, a seaweed salad, and a special roll called The Lion King (shrimp tempura, avocado, topped with spicy tuna).  Nothing outstanding, but I'd say good solid \"regular sushi\" fare. I wasn't disappointed by any stretch. Then... the restaurant started getting crowded. Since I was a party of one, I was saddled up to the bar - but now they were seating 2s and 3s there to accommodate everyone. I was finished with my food, but my beer was only half gone...and my waitress brings me the check! \"How do you want to pay for this?\" she asks, as she's literally holding the card machine in her hands. \"Uh...ok...here\" I respond as I give her my American Express card.   You know that deer in headlights look? Well, she gives it to me and then smiles: \"We don't take American Express.\"  Well...you can't even guess what happens next. After I tell her its all I've got on me because I left everything else back at my hotel, she goes back to the deer stare. I'm thinking, you can't be serious...then she runs to get the manager.   Now, in my head I'm thinking they will just make an exception and swipe my card. I mean, come on, its downtown Toronto. This has to have happened before...right? So, the manager comes over and again the statements about how they only take Visa begin. Only take Visa?  After I say, again, that all I have is an AMEX, she stares at me. I honestly thought I was going to have to go wash dishes in the back room to pay for the meal. So I tell her that I'm happy to go back to my hotel and get a Visa card, to which she responds: \"you know there's an ATM machine next door.\"   Really?   So I say again, I'll go back to my hotel and grab my other credit card. She is really unsure now, so then she responds, \"well you have to leave your drivers license here then.\"  I comply and hand it over, although I was a bit annoyed. But hey, I get it. So, then I begin to grab for my beer to finish it, and they begin clearing my plates - AND TAKE MY BEER!!!! They wouldn't even let me finish it! Before I could even walk to the front door, they were getting out 2 menus to seat a couple waiting. O H.  M Y. G O S H!!  Then, I walk outside and hail a cab. Thank goodness he was really nice and made me laugh about it. He said he'd been driving a cab for 10 years and had never heard a story like this.   3 stars for the initial good service and the food. Minus 2 for not taking AMEX and not letting me finish my beer!"}
{"text":"Good sushi in Toronto, although a little on the pricey side for Canada. The restaurant seems more casual/bar-like than most high end sushi places, but the sushi, plating, and presentation are all flawless.  Fish quality and preparation were excellent as well, and service was good.  The menu included all the standard Japanese sushi place fare, and some creative (but not crazy) rolls.  I don't know that much about the Toronto market, but I'd probably be back if this place were in Seattle."}
{"text":"Very reasonable American-style sushi. Gyoza were a bit weird (crispy) but good. Sushi was Americanized, tasty but not dedicated to the flavor of the fish.  All in all a pretty good lunch but not really for traditional sushi lovers ;)"}
{"text":"We went there for a birthday. There were no open tables unless you had a reservation and we were just two people. We sat at the bar. The service was polite and friendly. The food was great and I will definitely come back to have more. We ordered a seaweed salad that actually never came (...But mistakes happen and I understand that.) The spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls as well as one of their specialty rolls. I really liked the fact that the spicy rolls were spicy enough for my taste and the actual tuna/salmon meat was spiced up instead of just served with spicy mayo on top as most places do. The space was a bit dark for my taste but the food was so good that overcomes the fact that I did not enjoy the apace that much. The verdict is that this place is worth trying and what I tried was excellent."}
{"text":"The first impression was alright. We called to check there was any available seating, but the guy answered the call said no reservations and they were busy. But we got seated in seconds at the upper level when we randomly show up at the restaurant 15 minutes after initially calling for a reservation.   *SPECULATION - I think the guy, who answered the call secretly wants to sabotage the business.*  Decor - was dark and modern  Food - was great! Must try the Queen Salmon Roll"}
{"text":"My new favourite sushi location in downtown. Must try the salmon pushed sushi and the black dragon roll!! The waitresses were all very nice. However, i don't recommend the sunset special roll (very odd tasting)."}
{"text":"This place is like hipster meets Japanese food and I love it!   The cocktails are very sweet, so it might be advisable to ask for them with no sweets (which one person in my party did and hers was perfect, still sweet, but not syrupy). I had the yuzu Toronto and it was delicious with bright hinds of yuzu and lots of mint. The green tea martini was lightly sweet with notes of green tea (get this one with no sweets, and it's still quite sweet). The Rose something just tastes like peach schnapps, so that one can be skipped. Cocktails are 8$ and pitchers are 11$ at happy hour!!!!  The sushi and sashimi were amazing, nice big pieces of fish, and all beautifully presented. The agedashi tofu is not really agedashi tofu, but still tasty, the takoyaki is delicious and super hot and fresh! And the bibimpap is hot, fresh and large (it was a lot of rice, but the super delicious).   The service was friendly and attentive and food came out quickly. Definitely a place to eat with your eyes and your stomach!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening and were seated at the bar right away. The place has a fun vibe and an interesting sushi rolls. We got the torched rolls which were excellent!  Prices are slightly on the higher side but portions are generous and overall a great experience. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love this place - I have been to Saku a number of times and I plan to keep going back on a regular basis. Their Sashimi and (huge) Maki Rolls are the highly recommended. And they all come at a very reasonable price.  This place is always busy - you will need to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and very private seats. The food is fusion Japanese and Korean. We ordered a salad and salmon tartar as starter and 3 roles for main course. The roles are larger than usual ( I think 12 pieces) so all together it was too much for 2. While the food is good and interesting it lacks that wow factor to make it a five star. Basically not good but but memorable."}
{"text":"The sushi here is actually pretty good. I got the half order of the chef's special and the fish was fresh. I like that its Japanese style in the sense that the sushi doesn't  have a huge block of rice. It's a delicate pinkie-fingered size amount, allowing you to enjoy the taste of the fish and not forcing you to fill up on rice. I'd definitely order from there again... and I'm a bit of a sushi snob!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening at 7:45pm for a light dinner date. Restaurant did not seem very busy. They gave us a jug of water with only one cup. Took us a bit of time to flag the waitress down for another cup.   Ordered the Dragon roll and the Washington roll and a few orders of salmon sashimi. The food was really fresh and nicely prepared. The sashimi was my favorite.   The bar area was nicely decorated and the rest of the decor was well done.   I wish the service picked up a bit more but the food was well prepared and came quickly and the decor was nicely done. I would recommend this place to my friends and I would come back again."}
{"text":"My sister wanted sushi and found various reviews so decided to try Saku Sushi.  Quick service and they were friendly.  Sashimi was fairly standard but the rolls were incredible. The one that knocked my socks off was the beef crunch roll which I anticipated by the description would be mediocre. It was inspired! We did not manage to get a photo as it was consumed too quickly.   We also ate a volcano roll and another roll I can't remember the name of. Really nice fish quality and affordable.  I wouldn't bring a really huge group here but for 2-4 it would be a top choice for me."}
{"text":"So good! The price is also decent for a la carte sushi.   I got the daily sushi sampler ($12) and my friends got lunch dishes without sushi that were similarly priced. The fish and rice both tasted fresh and the portion size was pretty much what I expected.  We went right when they opened so there was no wait, but soon after, the restaurant filled up. It's quite a small space, so go early or be ready to wait!"}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend for lunch right when they opened. The place was pretty empty and we were greeted warmly by the servers, who were talking in Korean before we came in. We ordered 5 rolls and chefs special sushi set. Yes.. we ordered way too much; we would've been very happy with just 3 rolls. We got the standard California, eel and cucumber, spicy tuna, and salmon and avocado rolls. We got the special volcano roll, which was a yam and shrimp tempura roll loaded with spicy salmon on top. I thought it was okay but my boyfriend really enjoyed that one. The chef's special sushi set was pretty good. Fish was fresh, you get a whole assortment of different sushi to try. The set that I got included raw prawn sushi, scallop sushi, amongst many others. This was the highlight of the meal for me. The rice was a little on the warmer side, maybe just because we went right when they opened...   The sushi here is pretty good, and this would've been a 4 star review if it weren't for the worn out leather/faux leather seats... For me, sitting on worn out couch immediately transports me to the basement of some sketch house in Chinatown where countless drunken college/university parties took place... I'd much rather sit on hard wooden benches, at least it wont constantly remind me of the countless butts that came in contact with these seats."}
{"text":"Very well made sushi. We tried a salmon roll, a dynamite roll, shrimp tempura roll, and a red tuna roll. They were all great, atmosphere was nice and quiet, and the service was good. Would come back when I visit the city again. Not a 5 because it didn't exceed my expectations, because it was everything I expected it to be."}
{"text":"Love this place! The restaurant has a very casual but still hip ambiance. Honestly, the hype is real. After hearing multiple recommendations to Saku, I finally got to try it out. I opted for the Combo B for myself and was super satisfied with the amount of food. I found the quality of the fish to be very good and worth the value. I think the prices are super reasonable for what we are getting. I've also heard great things about the speical rolls here and can't wait to try next time! Service was also good which made the whole experience great. Can't wait to come back for future sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"Cute little sushi place with great decor and friendly staff.  The food was also delicious and filling.  The drinks are also so unique! I tried the Blushing Dragon and it was amazing"}
{"text":"I moved from BC a couple years ago, and I have been struggling finding decent sushi. Saku is one of the best sushi places I've tried so far in Toronto. Price is very reasonable for the quality they offer. On average you will spend 25-50bucks/person on food."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place after seeing all the amazing Yelp reviews on this place and they did not disappoint. Was very impressed this evening.  We made reservations just incase we couldn't get seating if we came during dinner rush. My friend was able to easily make a reservation for us. When we arrived it didn't seem too busy. Shocking because it was about 7:15. When we left it was quite packed!   First impressions, very hip spot. It is actually a good spot for any occasion. Could be with friends or even a nice place for a first date or date night :) We got seated right away at a nice comfy booth in the back. Our waitress came by and told us some specials and let us decide. My friends got a few drinks (can't remember them all but I'm sure one of them will Yelp about it later =P) We also ordered our rolls. We were a hungry bunch so we went with Volcano, Lion King, Ocean, Energy and the Chef Dinner A. Omg - Chef dinner A did not disappoint. Such an amazing selection of delicious sushi! I would definitely order that again. Some of the rolls tasted quite similar, but they were quite delicious as you can see from the album posted by others. Most of the prawn rolls were the best - it wasn't crappy prawn tempura that you get at mediocre restaurants, this was like a full piece of shrimp per piece we ate. I think that's great quality and all sushi restaurants should be this good and not cheap out. Portion sizes were great and prices are very fair.   I love this place. I will be back. We did order a lot because we were a hungry bunch so 4 rolls + sushi + 3 drinks was about $30 a person. You could totally be full off the Sushi Selection (because it comes with 6 maki as well) and a roll for two people. I hope this restaurant keeps up with the quality because they will definitely have a huge following!  Ps. Used the 10% off one of the rolls checking in on Yelp :)"}
{"text":"This place was close to our condo so we decided to come try it out. We tried the 10PC chefs special plus an order of Uni. This place definitely was delicious and would come back again!"}
{"text":"The fish is fresh, the edamame is salty, and the Volcano roll is a decadent beast that is difficult to conquer in one bite (but so worth it if you can)!   Good Sushi, good price, great time. Plus, $4 Sapporo  on Monday's!    ALSO the house hot sauce is fire ."}
{"text":"Came here with two of my friends and had a great time. I ordered a black dragon, my friends ordered salmon pressed sushi roll and assorted aburi sushi. The sushi came out relatively fast and the roll had just the right amount of rice and was on the bigger side so I was very full. I was also very pleased with the amount of sushi in the roll. My friend's aburi roll looked AMAZING! It was $22 so I thought it was slightly expensive but when it came out I realized that it was cheap considering the quality and amount of sushi given. We all had a great time overall; the waitress was kind, the music was great, and the food was very satisfying and surprisingly high quality."}
{"text":"Their shashimi is great and fresh. The price is reasonable. We ordered the chirashi bowl and the house sushi. They were both amazing. $55 including tax in total. Not a bad deal."}
{"text":"New and in a pretty competitive sushi area of the city. The staff is honestly so lovely, and super helpful with ordering.   The menu is pretty limited compared to some places, but everything is really good. You can definitely get more food for less money at a few places nearby, but this is higher quality and the lunch combos are great.   Highly recommend the veggie rolls, and the salads are way better than your standard sushi shop iceberg (like the mango avocado on mixed greens).   Depends a bit on what you're into sushi wise, and how big an appetite you have, but totally worth a try, and especially during Sapporo special time :)"}
{"text":"Friday nite date with the wife.  Great uni shashimi.  Wasn't a fan of the rolls as there was too much cheese sauce on it. Attentive service and great entrees of Sushi and Shashimi."}
{"text":"Great place to spend a cozy evening (or lunch) with your friends. The prices are a little bit steep but their sushi rolls are pretty decent size and really good! I absolutely love the atmosphere and the customer service. My only concern would be that their rolls are always felling apart and they do not have enough vegetarian options. They have only two vegetarian specialty rolls (Garden and Rocky Mountain roll) but they are both so good!! You can also order avocado or yam tempura rolls, though. On the other hand they have this delicious Green Tea Cheesecake. It's definitely a must try if you prefer your dessert less sweet."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like that place. This place came highly recommend and we decided to try it. It's slightly better than AYCE sushi but not that much more appetizing. So far Miku wins and I am scared to try the other places in Toronto now.   We ordered a bunch of special rolls, the daily sushi, tataki, tempura and miso soup.   The portion sizes are were very big but not very tasty. The ratio of rice, avocado and fish are not proportionate.   We had a lot of leftovers and decided not to pack it.   If you don't mind the mediocre quality, might be wort a try for the price. I personally pay more and have better sushi."}
{"text":"Downgraded upon visit for lunch today!  Food is o-kay, but service is inconsistent, can be moody depending on which waitress you get, & they didn't have at least 2 beers off their menu.  I tried to order a Sapporo, they didn't have that, then I asked for an Asahi Black, & they didn't have that either.  This is on a Saturday for Lunch.  Who knows whatelse they didn't have.    Once we were seated, neither tea/water was served while EVERYONE else that was seated had both drinks.  And we had to ask for tea.  We also asked if we could substitute a roll off the Lunch Specials menu for another one of the same price, but waitress just shook her head and said they don't do substitutions.  Waitress had a very sulky attitude.  Salad also never arrived with Lunch and we had to ask for that.  Other waitress was friendlier, but lots of gaps in their service, overall.  Food isn't that special that I'd go out of my way for especially with the attitude...and menu items that aren't actually available!"}
{"text":"Well. Couple of issues out the gate. No sushi bar. Just a regular bar.  Fish selection is pretty basic, so I'm not sure why this is so highly rated. Waiting for my first order, but I can tell. This is a 3 out of 5 almost guaranteed. I'll wait for food before I post, but believe me, I know what's coming.  Well, I was, sadly, correct. Mediocre at best. These guys are trying, but they just don't know what they're doing. 4 pieces of sushi per order?  Why? Rice is good, but far too much per nigiri piece. They don't know how to handle Ama Ebi heads.   Just, blah."}
{"text":"This place was great. I loved the waitstaff service. The rolls were amazingly fresh! We ordered a decent amount of rolls. The Lion King was really good! We had a lunch combination thing, it included a spicy salmon roll. Let me tell you, not the typical cheapo roll. It was just delicious.   The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the uni. Everything else was just perfect.  The slices of sashimi were nice and thick. I would recommend this place if you're traveling and you're nearby."}
{"text":"Saku Sushi is a cute little spot on Queen st that serves one of the best sushi in Toronto! The prices aren't too high but the quality is on par with high end spots.  Like all the other reviews, I definitely recommend the Aburi sushi. I also recommend the fried eggplant tempura. Crispy and sweet. They also have several sushi combo options that are fairly reasonable in price and look and taste exceptional. I should mention that they are usually busy during dinner times. Be sure to make a reservation! If not you might find yourself waiting over 30-45 mins."}
{"text":"Literally as good as it gets for the price. Got the sushi combo. Quality and quantity on point. So worth."}
{"text":"My first review but I've been to Saku before. Fresh cooked rolls (I don't eat raw) and service as you would expect from a Japanese restaurant. Cordial and attentive when needed. Had the spider roll which was top notch. Creamy crab meat alongside crispy crab. Another enjoyable meal in the tummy."}
{"text":"Saku Sushi is one of the best sushi experiences i've had in Toronto. The rolls are extremely unique and well crafted, while the fish is incredibly fresh. My suggestions would include the Island Roll, Ocean Dream and the Salmon Pressed sushi. Definitely my new go to spot!"}
{"text":"I have been to saku quit a bit now so I figured I should at least leave a review.   They have AMAZING sushi for a good price. Their aburi sushi is a must try!! Their chicken karaage was delicious and I would also recommend their lobster king roll!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sushi snob, so maybe you should take this with a grain of salt, but I prefer the sushi at some AYCE spots (August 8, Ginza) over this one...  I had their gyoza (good) and their special pressed sushi (mediocre).   The service was a bit spotty, as we were kicked out of our table despite the place being a quarter empty. I also felt a bit sick after eating here, so I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a definite hit! Saku is a great place for some reasonably-priced, fresh, quality sushi and specialty rolls. The decor is hip and modern; the full-service bar also makes it the perfect location to catch up with friends over a few drinks pre/post dinner. One thing we thought could improve was the service as we felt pushed to order quickly, our dishes were not cleared and towards the end, we felt rushed with the bill. However, that won't be enough to deter us from this yummy sushi joint! We only wish it was closer!  https://teamdesman.wordpress.com/2016/02/02/saku/"}
{"text":"Saku sushi is one of my favourite sushi restaurants in downtown Toronto. Came here for dinner for a couple of times. The vibe is different from a regular sushi restaurant as there is a bar/lounge at the front and they serve a wide selection of sake/beer/cocktails. The sushi, sashimi and rolls are also great and given the quality of the food, it is not overpriced in my opinion.   Will definitely come back for their sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I've been three times and keep coming back for the food but they have to fix their service issue! Very slow service, have to chase waiters down for water or refills, or meals come out of order (ex. soup/salad arrives after everything else). Has happened each time I've been. Hope they fix it because it could really be an exceptional restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant a couple of times. It always extremely busy even on a Monday or Tuesday. So it's best to make a reservation to ensure a seat and no wait.   One of my favourite things at this restaurant is their creamy croquettes. They were absolutely delicious. The filly was smooth, creamy and cheesy.    I've also tried the aburi sushi set. It came with a variety of different nigiri. They were all torched and paired with a different sauce and topping on top. The Sushi was pretty good. They were fresh and flavourful.   Sometimes I also order the unagii aburi Sushi on the side because it's extremely delicious. But there's addition charges to make the regular unagi nigiri into an aburi unagi Sushi. I think it was an additional $0.50-$1? I don't remember the exact cost but it's good  We've also ordered the salmon oshi and the tuna oshi. To me I felt like the tuna oshi was way better than the salmon one. The salmon oshi was meh, it felt like something was missing. It has a different flavour to it compared to miku and jabistro. But price was pretty reasonable for the portion.   Two thing I would not recommend ordering are the wasabi tako and the island rolll. In my opinion, the wasabi tako wasn't really worth it. I didn't really like the taste of it. The flavour was really strong, it went up my nose. But if you like wasabi they it's worth a try. As for the island roll. To me it was just bad. I didn't like the texture of it because of the sweet potato that they topped it with. It tasted like baby food and didn't blend well with the roll.    Overall, decent place for some sushi but better for beer and drinks because they have nice specials depending on what day you go. Service was alright but the waiters weren't too attentive the times I went."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good sushi. My review is solely based on takeout since I work in the area.   The interior looks nice (from what I can see when I drop by to pick up my food)  Their menu has a wise variety and selections to pick from. & lunch is until 3 so you can order from their lunch menu too.   The pricing is decent for anyone willing to pay a few extra for freshness."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is a gem. The sushi was incredible. Nice, warm rice, and absolutely gorgeous and delicious cuts of fish. I wish I lived in Toronto so I could eat here every day.   We only tried the sushi, so I can't review everything on the menu, but it was really phenomenal. We had the spicy scallop roll, which was great. We also had the Toro (+++), Himachi (++), and Salmon (++) nigiri.   This place was fantastic. So delicious!"}
{"text":"This place really disappointed me. It's a 2.5 - It's in between ok, and i've definitely experienced much better in Toronto.  The place looks virtually the same from post the glory days of previous restaurant Grasslands. They did a good job making the place look good and i'm sure Saku got a decent deal out of it. So service and interior wise, this place is good.  Where they fall short is in the food. A few problem areas:  1) Sushi rice is just terrible. Doesn't hold up at all. Mushy, gooey - i'm not sure how they're not getting this right.  2) Flavours: very underwhelming and confused. It's not about the quality of the ingredients here and there's little focus on the fish itself - it's all about dressing up the sushi with way too much stuff. Maybe it's just too modern for me personally - but it just confuses more than impresses.   3) Torching sushi with mayonnaise -  really done poorly - why do that with mayonaise? Additionally, the pressed sushi is also very poorly executed. Somewhere between what it's meant to be and normal (North American) sushi.   All in all, i will not be coming back here. But hey, it will work for some."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found the reincarnation of Hub Sushi. Ever since my last visit to Hub, I've been so disappointed in the quality of the food. Saku on the other hand is the same (if not better) than what Hub used to be. Located on Queen, this new restaurant has very modern decor and an overall comfortable setting.  Saku has a number of special rolls which I found were all really good. We tried five different rolls: Lion King, Saku, Volcano, Ocean Dream and Island. All of them were very nicely presented and portions were great for sharing.  Unfortunately, the server forgot one of our rolls which is where this restaurant loses a point. We posted pictures on our Instagram and also got free Mochi for dessert.  If you're downtown and looking for sushi, give Saku a try! Reasonable prices and excellent quality food!"}
{"text":"Came here with a intense craving for aburi sushi. I made reservations online a week in advance and only got confirmation two days before my reservation date so I don't think their service is very automated.  Walking into the restaurant it reminded me of may of the adjacent restaurants along queen west more notably bar chef as it had the bar in the same location inside of the restaurant. There is a larger seating area after you past the bar located behind the restaurant with very hipster booths.  We had for dinner: -Sake flight -One Day Black cod -Assorted Aburi Sushi -Volcano Roll (10% off special rolls when you check in with yelp) -Salmon pressed sushi  For the flight it came with three sake pairings. Off the top of my head there was on plum (Sweet) a dry and a well rounded sake, Nice to sip on while waiting for your food  One day black cod was very delicious and very smooth but the portion size was much smaller than anticipated and looking back was not worth the $14  The aburi was very good and I would compare the aburi to a more affordable version of Miku. There was a good range of fish and flavors.  Volcano roll is very filling but it's something I would get one time to try but probably not the next time i go. The roll is massive (two bite sushi)  The pressed salmon sushi was most impressive, it was very boxy and tasted very smooth aburi style.  Would get everything I got again except for the black cod and volcano roll the next time I visit"}
{"text":"Really good sushi located on Queen street. What I like about this place is the prices are not ridiculously expensive and the quality you get is fantastic. The rolls are quite unique and tasty. Prices range from $13-15 for special roles. You also get your food quite quickly. I do suggest making reservations because when it gets busy you might be out of luck. Make sure you check in on yelp. You get 10% off a special role."}
{"text":"If you don't want Overpriced Omakase, this is what you should go for!  - Chef's Selection  - Aburi Chef's Selection  - Ocean Dream Roll  Nice sushi & great environment!:)   Check out my instagram: https://www.instagram.com/torontofoodiejournal"}
{"text":"when I first walked into this place I thought to myself.. what a hip modern looking sushi joint. I was pumped and excited, only to find that the flavour did not deliver.   The atmosphere of the resto was super chill. I loved it. the details of the decoration, the lights and colors at the bar. The music that they played really put a nice touch to my experience.  I ordered the spicy salmon crunch rolls, chicken kaarage, and the beef yaki udon, all of which were bland and need heavy seasoning. This place was pretty pricey considering the rolls I ordered were no special than any other sushi joint. I definitely had better chicken karaage before and my beef yaki udon was bland. The presentation was super cute, and very eye appealing, but the food just lacked flavour.  I would say 2.5 stars, I was not feeling the food, it was all basic stuff at high prices, with little wow factor."}
{"text":"Somewhat of a fusion sushi place with lots of maki rolls on the menu ranging from traditional to speciality including aburi style rolls which were phenomenal. Service is great and friendly. Prices are below average for similar places downtown."}
{"text":"Service and sushi are both top notch! It's amazingly affordable for it's quality and my go to rolls are the Volcano Roll and the Torched Salmon Oshi Sushi (it's so heavenly, it just melts in your mouth)!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, nice place, the salmon pizza was amazing! Not my favorite neighborhood though"}
{"text":"Chefs special sushi and the beef roll were excellent. Try their litchi drink red rose something!  Also their service made the experience even better. The ladies serving us were helpful, smiling and accommodating."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! We basically ordered the whole menu including the creamy korroke, takoyaki, bibimbap, crazy sushi roll, and another roll that I can't remember the name of. Every single thing was delicious. They even gave us free soup because the food was taking awhile (it wasn't even that long of a wait!). The only thing I didn't like was the smell of the restaurant, kind of a weird musty smell haha not super appetising when you walk in."}
{"text":"Really love this place! The sashimi was fresh, the staff was friendly, and the place itself looked very pleasant! We all loved what we ordered and everything came right in time.  Totally recommend this place! If I lived close this sushi joint I would probably eat here every day! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Japanese restaurant in downtown Toronto. I've always been a sucker for Torched sushi so I was really excited to try the torched sushi here!  We got three rolls of torched sushi. They exceeded my expectations as they instantly melt in my mouth. The fish was torched perfectly.   For dessert, all of us got a different cheesecake. My favourite was the raspberry cheesecake. It had a subtle raspberry flavour that didn't overpower the actual cheesecake taste.  To my surprise, the food here is priced fairly reasonably!  Will definitely come back! Be sure you make reservations."}
{"text":"Came here this past Friday with the BF. Made reservations for 8 for 2. Read a few reviews on Yelp where the suggestion to make reservation would be best. Sure glad we did as the place was packed when we arrived. The atmosphere of the place pretty poppin'. With the many reviews online, we were eying on the Ocean roll. Ordered it and it was on point. The waitress suggested the drink special - a pint of Sapporo and a shot of tequila. The food was tasty, fresh and the service was pretty good.   Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Favourite sushi spot in Toronto! When friends are looking for a recommendation for sushi this is always my go to. As Aburi sushi is becoming more and more popular this place offers great options that are comparable to places like JaBistro and Miku, but way more affordable. I have tried a variety of things from Saku but my favourites would have to be the Assorted Aburi Sushi, Atlantic Queen and Chef's Selections (B). Extremely fresh, good portions and overall one of the best sushi places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"WOW. amazing sushi. I found this place before coming to Toronto and bookmarked it. What I was impressed by was the plating. It's a little on the pricey side (rolls 11-20$) but very worth it. I highly recommend the ocean dream roll & lobster king roll. Everything was so delicious and filling. I liked that their don't use much rice and use more fish, another big plus for a good sushi spot. I will definitely come back when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Saku has always delivered in my books with its unique rolls and great starters.  I personally enjoy the baked rolls offered here - the Island roll at $12 which has avocado, prawn tempura, scallop, and yam is delicious. They are a bit heavy compared to standard rolls, so I'd recommend ordering a few and sharing between friends for some variety.  The chirashi don at $25 is a great dinner option. The fish and uni is very fresh and worth the price you're paying.  In terms of sashimi, the best value would be to order their take out offers. We found it strange that they didn't offer any \"boats\" at the restaurant, but had them available for takeout. We ordered a 50pc sashimi platter which was $55. It was fresh and great quality fish.  Overall, Saku is an excellent sushi pick in general (especially since they offer items like bibimbap for anyone who isn't a sushi fanatic) but maybe go elsewhere if you're looking to gorge on sashimi."}
{"text":"Saku sushi is my go to place whenever I have a sushi craving. There is no comparison downtown when it comes to getting the most value out of your money! It is more of a casual dinner place, so don't make the mistake of coming here for birthdays. Highly recommended and will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"The number one thing I have to say about Saku is that their dishes are fresh, tasty and decently priced for an à la cart sushi restaurant -- definitely above your average sushi. Apart from that, the hosts/hostesses were very friendly and efficient. Even after we were done eating, we talked for at least another hour and they never rushed the bill over. And personally, I loved the atmosphere. The restaurant had an energetic yet intimate feel, probably because of the dim lights, house music and buzzing chatter.  We ordered the Chicken Karaage, Atlantic Queen roll, Salmon Oshi Zushi, Chef Special Sushi, Energy roll, Ocean Dream roll and the Premium Sashimi Platter. For our party of 3, this was enough to stuff us!   Although I wasn't expecting to order the chicken karaage, I'm glad we did! They gave us generous pieces of crispy-on-the-outside, juicy-on-the-inside chicken that tasted amazing with the sauce provided. Out of all the rolls we tried, the Atlantic Queen was the best -- super flavourful and only $12!! We couldn't see or taste any tuna in the Energy roll, but it was still really good. The Chef Special Sushi ($22) came with 12 colourful pieces of nigiri, one of which included TORO (fatty tuna)!! The Premium Sashimi Platter ($22) also came with a great selection of fresh melt-in-your-mouth high quality fish, and was totally worth it!  The only dish I wasn't particularly fond of was the Ocean Dream roll. It was garnished with pickled cucumbers on top, which I'm not a fan of. And when I took the cucumber off, the roll was quite plain.   Overall, I'm glad I found this place! I find downtown sushi joints be misses more often than hits, but Saku is definitely not the case! Also, I wouldn't compare Saku to top-notch places like Jabistro and Miku since they're on 2 completely different levels, but Saku is definitely up there for it's category.   *I wasn't planning on writing a review, so the only pics I have are snapchat-quality.. Sorry!*"}
{"text":"In a sea of below-average sushi joints on the small stretch of Queen St West, this place is a shining beacon for sushi lovers everywhere!  We ordered a sushi/sashimi set, Energy and Volcano rolls, grilled octopus, and 5 pieces of uni to share. Rolls were HUGE! Pretty sure there was more than 10 pieces for each roll. Everything was fresh, and I liked that we got cuts of fish outside of the typical options you get.   The only small thing I'd suggest to their drink menu is focus. Quality over quantity. Some drink choices were a tad ambitious. Case in point - my old fashioned did not need to be lit on fire.   Fresh fish, creative rolls, and a good price point, I hope this restaurant is here to stay."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other night with my boyfriend and I've got to say, they have delicious sushi.   5/5 for the decor and atmosphere. Great vibe, beautiful bar and great seating areas; Nice and private with comfortable booths.   4.5/5 service was exceptional. Very helpful and tentative. Servers have great suggestions and Food came out quickly. Minus .5 because they forgot to apply the Yelp check in discount. Hopefully they can apply it the next time I go.   4/5  for Sushi. Fresh and good quality and portion. We ordered uni sushi (good portion), Aburi sushi- very flavourful, lion king- tasty, but not my favourite roll.. tasted more sweet potato that sushi and a soft shell crab appetizer- really good and glad it came with salad.   3/5 wide selection, but their cocktails are really sweet. The old fashioned was tasty and flavourful, but way too sweet for our liking. Their sake flights are ok, but the servings are really small. $11 for 3.   3/5 Dessert- good portion of green tea cheesecake was good but not the best I've had. Was looking for more matcha flavour and tarte taste, but instead it was drenched in condensed milk sauce.  Overall, I would come back again and would recommend others to come here.. hopefully I can update the drink and dessert rating to a 4."}
{"text":"Best and freshest sushi @ \"Saku Sushi\" - Queen West just a couple blocks west of Spadina. Consistently everytime delicious sushi in a casual elegant nightime atmosphere. The Aburi slightly-torched sushi and rolls are some of the best sushi I've tasted in downtown Toronto, highly recommended!! Thank you Saku."}
{"text":"Went recently and was disappointed by the changes made by the chef. I always order the assorted aburi sushi. There's usually a variety of flavours and textures for each nigiri. On my most recent visit they flavour and method of preparation was the same for all the aburi. No point serving different fish if it's all going to be covered in the same mayo sauce.  The maki rolls are still good, though I'm apprehensive. If they continue to dilute the quality of their dishes I probably won't return and would pay the premium for consistency at miku instead. Previously would give Saku 5/5."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on Saturday afternoon for lunch, based on Yelp reviews.  The space is very modern and trendy, with fun lighting and decor.  We ask for help ordering, and our waitress could have been nicer but it was not a big deal. Whom I assume to be the manager came out many times to check on us and serve us, and was so pleasant.  For the food we ordered a lunch combo of dynamite roll, spicy salmon roll, and California roll which came with one miso and a small salad which we shared. The spicy salmon roll was our favourite, warm and delightful.  We also ordered the volcano roll and a large version of the dragon roll. The rolls were soft and tasty.  We've been to a few other sushi spots since coming here and we've always said this is the better. They pay attention or plating and the flavours are good and the selections creative!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of dt TO (where all the amaze eats are these days) . A hidden little gem with some big taste sushis and sashimis (and hot food!)   Not too pricey for what they offer. Their bar area was quite pretty with their lights, and doesn't get overly loud like a lot of bars can get. If you sit further into the restaurant though it does get a bit louder, so if you want a slightly more quiet atmosphere ask to sit in the front half of the restaurant. Word of advice: do not sit in the booth seat closest to the bathroom stairs; not that there's any smell but that was a fairly cold spot, like the ac was jacked up specifically for that booth.  Onto the service - very nice, efficient, and courteous. Staff was patient with my order and questions, and was helpful with descriptions of the dishes.  The food - very fresh and presentable. Unfortunately, some of the dishes that I saw here were no longer available, which was one of the major reasons for my visit, so that was a disappointment. However, the other dishes kinda made up for it. Ie. their raw sweet shrimp, sashimi platter, dinner combos, ocean and volcano rolls were all well done, from flavours down to presentation. Personally I would've liked it more had they presented everything on a black, stone dish as opposed to some being black stone and some being white plastic. Just a consistency and presentation thing.  Not much of a selection on desserts so we skipped that.   All in all, a great place for some yummy sushi. Would return!"}
{"text":"Extremely fresh, their dinner combos are great and staff super friendly and goes out of their way to help. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give this place a 3.5. Coming from Vancouver, I wasn't expecting much for sushi in Toronto in general but my friend recommended it. It was better than what I expected of Toronto.  First time I came we got the ocean dream and salmon pressed sushi. It was a good amount of food because of the rice for both of us, and I was impressed at how quickly we got the rolls.   Second time we got the fried oyster, tuna pressed sushi and the volcano.   Taste:  Fried oyster - there were 3 huge fried oysters but it was mostly just the breading/panko  that made it look huge although there was plenty of oyster too. Not my fave as I'm not a huge fan of eating that much fried food all at once.  Rolls: nice presentation, a little too mayo-y on the tuna pressed sushi. The tuna was pretty thin in comparison to the rice but the one night we got salmon pressed sushi the ratio was good so maybe it depends on the day. Volcano and ocean dream were both decent.   Store: We came here on a Wednesday night and had to wait about 10-15 mins to get a booth seat. Good ambiance with a bar to sit/eat at for those who don't want to wait.  I also came back on a Friday night and it was pretty busy so my friend and I are at the bar."}
{"text":"Yes. Ocean Dream was a fav of the group. Personally, really liked the Lobster King! Music and ambiance was pretty on point. Staff was also pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Went for take away today and got Ocean dream roll. Very tasty: juicy and good size. Great."}
{"text":"Didn't think that some places besides Miku could master aburi sushi. For a cheaper price, Saku has pretty decent sushi and if you're craving for Miku aburi but not willing to drop $20+ per dish, Saku is a good option"}
{"text":"Got spicy crunchy salmon  roll. Confused because it was not crunchy. Smooth salmon and was fresh. Tasted good  but I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've always been the AYCE Sushi kind of girl but Saku Sushi changed my life! Top quality food with exceptional service... AYCE sushi is never the same to me anymore ever since I've been to Saku.   My boyfriend and I came around 3 pm on a Saturday - it wasn't packed at all! Not surprising as there was a snow storm going on (bad weather still can't stop me from getting sushi). We were seated every fast in one of the tables in front of the bar. The decor was really sophisticated and modern - but even with the door closed, it was still very very cold. Saku should put a heater somewhere near the front tables during winter! Sushi is so much better when you don't have to wear a jacket and constantly think about how cold it is.   For food, we ordered:   - Salmon Pressed Sushi: AMAZING! It was so soft and melts in your mouth. I'm drooling just thinking about this. I already thought pressed sushi was good at AYCE, but Saku proved me wrong. I'm always getting this every time I come here!   - Lobster King Roll: I don't even know where to start. The rolls were GIGANTIC! I really loved that they put a lobster shell on top of the rolls .. presentation was A1 for my snaps LOL! I usually hate avocado in my sushi but there was so much in this roll that I can barely taste the avocado which is a big plus. It doesn't look very filling but you'll be surprised lol. I didn't eat anything prior to coming here but after eating and sharing this, I was already quite full. Definitely get this if you are down to try another type of roll that isn't too out of your comfort zone but not your typical AYCE special rolls.   - Kimchi Yaki Udon: I may be completely bias here, as I am a major Udon and kim chi fan but this was my favourite dish. The portion was huge, and the combination of the sour taste of the kimchi and saltines of the yaki Udon really put the whole plate together. The problem I find with most places is that they always put way too much onion in their yaki Udon, but that is not the case here! There was just the perfect amount of every ingredient to balance every single taste out. I usually prefer meat with my noodles but this was so good I didn't even mind it. If I wasn't so full, I would've gotten another one LOL!   - Premium Sashimi Platter: uhh if you're an adventurous person, definitely try this. This came with scallops, shrimps, king salmon, sea urchin and fish eggs. I'm more of a basic sashimi kind of gal, I prefer the regular salmon, white tuna and surf clam. Despite my protest to not get this, my boyfriend thought he was the shit and got it anyways. I barely touched it! I mean everything was still good but it just wasn't the same as the typical sashimi. The sea urchins was untouched :P ITS JUST NOT OUR THING! Someone with more of a back bone to try new foods would definitely enjoy this.   Food is definitely 5/5. Service is also 5/5, my boyfriend was sick and kept coughing throughout our time here. The server noticed and she offered tea and even a Tylenol in the end! I've been to many restaurants, few times where me or my bf was sick and never have I experienced or seen this. She really went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable! I wish I got her name to give her a proper shout out.   If you are looking for a restaurant with awesome food and feel taken care of, DEFINITELY COME TO SAKU! This is now my favourite sushi restaurant  everything was just perfect!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ordered mine to go and had to wait and watch while my friends finished theirs. Clearly they don't care about treating all of their customers equally. First and last time I'll be going there."}
{"text":"Decent sushi in a nice ambience - raising the bar in a sea of crappy Japanese joints on Queen West. At first I was skeptical that this was another overpriced Asian-inspired hipster lounge but Saku exceeded expectations and is becoming a go-to spot for me.   The main draws are the specialty rolls which are far from traditional style. They are filling and densely packed with ingredients so picking a roll each is a good way to try different ones with friends. My favourite is the Ocean Dream but those who like crunchy rolls will also enjoy Volcano and Energy. The small plates were also surprisingly up to par - the Chicken Karaage especially was lightly battered and crispy.   TAKEOUT IS 10% OFF!"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating. I think i've been spoiled by too many good sushi places so I might be slightly bias.  So, prior to coming I saw on their instagram posts there is a picture of their board stating \"$3 uni every friday\". Well that certainly caught my attention since i did go on a Friday. Turns out on the menu it says $4 for 1 piece(sushi or sashimi), and $6 for 2. Don't get me wrong that is still a good deal, but that false advertising definitely did not give me a good first impression. If you changed the price, maybe you should consider deleting that picture off your instagram.  Negitoro ($7) It was shocking to see that the negitoro was bursting out of the handroll. The negitoro itself was really good - minced really well and the portion was there but i would have preferred the negitoro spread through the entire handroll, meaning all the way to the bottom. When I reached halfway of my handroll it was all just rice.   Chef's Selection A ($21) This came with 12 sushi and 6 pieces of maki. This definitely was a good deal as there is quite a variety for the fish - included salmon, red tuna, unagi (bbq eel), hamachi, and torched sushi. One thing I found slightly odd was, there were 2 pieces of red tuna but one had a lemon on top and the other didn't..?? Same with Hamachi, there were 2 pieces, one had a piece of lime on top and the other didnt...?  Saku Roll ($13) Saku roll has tuna, scallop, coriander, cucumber and a piece of jalapeno on top. Considering this roll was named after their restaurant, I would assume this would be the best roll they offer but i personally thought it wasn't that great. There wasn't really flavor in this roll. I couldn't taste the ingredients - it just felt like everything mushed together. I wasn't sure if the scallop was inside the roll or part of the piece that was on top of the roll.   Red Tuna tartar ($13) this was a disappointment - the tuna sashimi was fresh but the tartar lacked flavor. Essentially it just tasted like chopped sashimi mixed with avocado. The dish was served with 6 pieces of taro chips which was definitely not enough to go with the tartar.   On a side note i didn't really like the service of our waitress - she was so inexperienced. I wasn't sure if it was because she couldn't hear me or she wasn't sure of what i was asking? She just sounded so unknowledgable when i asked her questions. I asked if they have toro, and she responds \"uhhh, i think so, yeah sure\" ....???? what exactly does that mean? I just find it odd as she looks at me like I'm speaking in a language she doesn't understand. Anyhow, apparently they do have a separate menu of all their fishes so you are able to order a la carte. This is what she said \"We do have an a la carte menu but we don't give it to everyone because it's just a sheet of paper that gets wrinkled and dirty.\" lol? I asked her \"can you guys do negitoro? If so i would like a negitoro handroll\". (negitoro was not on the menu) Her response was, \"um negitoro? hm yes i think so, i will ask for you\". ??? and guess what, she never came back telling me if it was possible. It was only until the handroll actually came, then i realized it was an available item which i did end up ordering not knowing the price.   The ingredients are fresh but for some reason it just felt like they weren't put together well and lacked expertise. The price is decent considering it is a downtown location, so can't complain about that. but if i were to think of a go-to sushi place, this would not be on the list."}
{"text":"Fav sushi place in Toronto!! Every dish you get here is SO GOOD  I've tried their sushi, bibimbap, karage, drinks, oyster, etc. and they're all so good for the price!!"}
{"text":"After finding Saku on Yelp I decided to try it out for a friend's birthday dinner and I am definitely coming back! The sushi was fresh and very reasonably priced.  For the four of us we each ordered a miso soup, the ceviche (YUM!) and a couple special rolls which totaled to around $30 each including tax and tip. They even had a $3.99 Sapporo beer special which we took advantage of! I am a big eater and I left full! I would make sure to make a reservation before hand because the place looked full even for a Monday night. Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Ordered takoyaki, chicken karage, and torched salmon maki.  The takoyaki and chicken karage were good. They're what they're supposed to be and nothing over ambitious to be something else.  The torched salmon was pretty good, the main thing I didn't like about it was that you can kinda taste the flavor of the propane or fuel they use. It's the most subtle thing but I noticed it."}
{"text":"Walked in no res @ around 6pm on Friday and seated right away.  So glad we found this place. We munched:  Combo A, sushi: amazing presentation and tasty, fresh sushi. For $22 it seemed like such a good value for the quantity and quality.  Combo B, sashimi: huge quantity and quality. So good for $22  Uni: on sale special, 2 pieces for $6.99. Pretty sweet, from vancouver.  Green tea matcha cheesecake: presentation was spot on, chocolate cigar was a tasty touch.   Yuzu cocktail: sweet, minty, easy to drink  Green teaini cocktail: easy to drink, sweet, would recommend  Overall, really enjoyed the food, value and the great service. Best sushi in the queen portland area. It's legit."}
{"text":"This is a 4.5 rating ****' I came here to celebrate a coworker securing a position coming out of night shift, upon the recommendation of a fellow sushi-addict. In short, a very high quality modern/fusion-type sushi place, for the price you pay. The rolls, nigiri, and sashimi were generously portioned, gorgeously plated, and very delicious. The rolls in particular were unique and made skilful use of aburi/torching, sweet/fruity flavours, and of course the freshness and savouriness of the fish. The bar and modern furnishings make for a very chic ambiance. I'll definitely check back again to explore their lunch combo offerings that I've heard others rave about. Great food, great value, solid experience---recommended."}
{"text":"a decently priced sushi bar with yummy sushi. their special rolls are very filling and quite unique as well. for those who don't eat raw fish, there are plenty of options to choose from. the only reason why it doesn't have 5 stars is because the takoyaki barely had any takos. Maybe 1 little piece per ball."}
{"text":"We got Ocean dream, Atlantic Queen and volcano rolls! Deliciousness:) big portions and fresh fish. Highly recommend this place :) also like their cocktail menu"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner  I had the chef's selection of 15pcs sashimi (I opted out of the side brown rice) which comes with miso soup and salad. I also had an order of uni gunkan.  One of the best places I've eaten sashimi at  None of their fish needed soy sauce (I used some initially). It's my first time having uni and it's not for me. The texture is great but the aftertaste not so much. Glad I tried it though!  I also had an order of the Spider roll which were bigger than the big rolls I'm used to. I couldn't eat a piece whole so I had to deconstruct it  They use real soft shell crab which is great! But $11 for the size of those rolls is a good deal! I Hikari's Godzilla roll trumps it any day   I am definitely coming back here for more of their delicious fish  EVEN THEIR SALAD IS GREAT?!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but not worth spending $100 per person.  I've had better sushi in town for cheaper price."}
{"text":"There is an abundance of sushi joints in Toronto, but good sushi joints.... I can only count with one finger.  I'm glad to be adding Saku to that list. Skeptical at first, but reassured by all the good reviews pointing to a consistent experience, we went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Surprisingly not busy at all around 1pm, the restaurant has a modern and sleek vibe to it. Our waitress was friendly and gave us some excellent recommendations. Between 3 hungry people we shared:  From the raw sushi menu: Lion King - prawn tempura, spicy tuna, avocado, green onion Energy - prawn tempura, avocado, spicy tuna, unagi  BBQ sushi menu: Island - prawn tempura, yam, avocado, scallop  Tapas: Breaded osyters with garlic mayo - this is meh. large pieces of oysters, heavily breaded.  Torched salmon pressed sushi  Food arrived quickly and nicely presented. My favourites were Island and Torched salmon pressed sushi. They just melt in your mouth, the combination of ingredients work really well for my taste.  We did note that since it's fusion there are a lot of sauces used and it got a little empowering in the end. It would've been nice to order two fusion rolls and a mix of their regular sashimi cut to find that balanced flavour. Most of their rolls use prawn tempura and avocado as base, reminiscent of green dragon.  Their prices are very reasonable, with most rolls averaging $11. They are huge in size too, we were really full at the end of our meal. I would definitely recommend going to Saku if you ever have a craving for sushi. Location is quite convenient and easy to find, I don't even think there are decent sushi spots around Queen St."}
{"text":"Went to saku on a late night cruise after visiting the infinity mirrors exhibit. I'm tired of the cheap Izakayas on queen west and wasnt looking to pay ja bistro or Miku prices either. But it's difficult to find something that falls right in between.   That being said, we ordered the karaage appetizer, the Chefs selection A (10 pieces sushi + 6 pieced house Maki, soup and salad) and B (12 pieces sashimi and 6 pieces house Maki, soup and salad) and a pitcher of Sapporo and all that cost 87$  Everything was really tasty and fresh, the portions were generous and we were both stuffed at the end.   The ambience makes it feel like a king west bar but without the douchery.   Since it was busy, we kind of were ignored in the beginning but after most of the tables emptied out the waitresses were very attentive.  Definitely coming back 10/10"}
{"text":"Not bad for downtown sushi at decent price point. The rolls were not as flavourful as they sounded. They could also be more generous with fish portion on their sushi. Overall not a bad place for a night out but not the most amazing sushi."}
{"text":"--- Food ---  First time trying this sushi place with my partner and we were very happy! :) We started off with Daily Special Sake Flight (3 kinds) $10 - my favourite was the Takara plum wine, delicious, the others were stronger and tasted pretty good as well. By the way, it was nice they didn't charge for hot tea (we thought usually Japanese restaurants would).   For the rolls, we ordered: 1) Lion king $12 - this was recommended by the waitress, it was fun to try as it had potato garnish with spicy tuna, but we would probably try something else next time.   2) Atlantic queen $12 - the seared salmon was delicious! We would definetely order this and the mackerel roll again.  3) Saba bow sushi $15 - we love mackerel! Try this! Each sushi piece was delicious.  We got 10% off one of the regular rolls by checking into Yelp. Overall, this meal was delicious because the sushi were different from the norm and tasty, while not being over priced.   --- Atmosphere ----  The atmosphere inside looks great. The decor is modern, great place to hang out with friends and family. Street parking available outside. Green P parking also available nearby. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. It was really nice that they don't rush you into paying the bill after you finish eating (we chatted for an additional 20 minutes) before we asked them for the bill (thanks, appreciated that!).   --- Overall --- We would definitely come here again. :)"}
{"text":"First off, love how affordable this spot is for the specialty rolls. I absolutely love that they serve the pressed sushi (the rectangular ones), and they give you a lot of pieces! I got the salmon pressed sushi and I would've liked for the salmon to be more raw rather than torched, and had a bit too much mayo in it - but not to say that it wasn't good, just could've been better. That's the reason for docking a star, but otherwise, I think it's a great spot and I've been meaning to find some time to return and try different things. We came on a Saturday early evening around 6pm and it was really easy (surprisingly) to find a table for 4 without reservations. Perhaps we got lucky because the restaurant was fairly packed."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi addict and this place seriously satisfies my cravings! Great location, super clean, and always busy. The vibe of the restaurant is great and I always take a couple of friends with me and we have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for sashimi and had good experiences with the overall ambiance and food quality. The Chirashi had a good variety of fresh sashimi, and the portions were decent. I preferred that to the Perfect Combo for One (Sashimi + sushi) which was a similar price point. The menu is quite extensive and the restaurant seems to be meant more for drinks and apps, but I am pleasantly surprised by their good quality sashimi."}
{"text":"Good sushi for decent prices! Ordered a volcano roll, sunset roll, salmon avocado roll, and toro nigiri. The rolls were delicious and for the price it was worth it. The toro nigiri was alright. Slightly fishy. I enjoyed my sake tini which basically tasted like candy. I didn't mind it but if you're not a fan of super sweet cocktails, the cocktails here won't be for you. The servers are also super friendly. Overall it was a good experience. I'd definitely come here again to satisfy my dirty sushi cravings."}
{"text":"Got the aburi, the fish was fresh and it was prepared with great attention. That was clear. But I understood that torched sashimi is not my thing. But I go to sushi places in every city I visit, this is the first time I heard of taco wasabi, made with chopped octopus and wasabi. It was unbelievable. Best appetizer in a sushi place. I highly recommend it. That thing made my night."}
{"text":"My Chef's Dinner came with sashimi rather than nigiri, which was odd but a welcome surprise because you should never turn down good sashimi. All the cuts were good quality, plus the house roll and Saku Roll were great. My husband got a diced octopus appetizer which was quite slimy and unappealing; should have just ordered grilled octo instead."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends, they seemed busy but were able to quickly seat the 6 of us. The layout of the restaurant is quite nice, love the decor out at the front of the place; not so much of the back where the booth is leather seating with part of it being cracked.   We ordered the aburi assorted sushi and energy roll, both i really enjoyed. The rolls were the size of a baby's arm with lots of filling as well as topping! I loved the selection offered with the aburi, def getting this again if Im ever around the area.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there for a late bite with friends. The food was good, but the service was not that great. As they were sitting us, the staff had told us to order quickly, as the kitchen was closing soon, but it took a good 10min for a waitress come take our orders...and only? because we asked her to.   So again, the food was good, the little service we got was slow, plus when paying by Interact, the machine defaults the tip to 20%...which you can modify."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey compared to the other Japanese restaurants around but the quality of fish is very fresh and they have some pretty good lunch specials.   My favourite is lunch c, which I believe is the salmon sashimi, sushi, roll lunch combo. They give you really thick slices of sashimi like an inch+. I've tried their chirashi and its $18. Really expensive for the amount they give you, but quality is fresh. I'd still rather get it elsewhere around the area though.   Service is a bit slow based on the last three times I went. Servers are the same but seem to be a bit clueless at times."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of my co-workers. We made a reservation ahead of time. They were great about it and accommodated the party as some people came late.  Inside the decor is great.  You'll notice the bar and the colorful lights when you come in. In the back they have booths and it looks pretty chic. A lot of natural wood is used but works great with the look of the place. Music is good and on point. The night I was here was good lounge music. Menu could be a little bit bigger but there's good diversity in the food.   My main course was a combination of sushi and sashimi and a roll. The presentation was one of the best I've seen before.  Fish was good and fresh tasting.  Pricing seems fair too.  I would recommend coming here on a date. The lighting and booths set a nice intimate mood.   The kitchen could have been a little faster but I understand.  My group is large. When you pay the sever brings a credit card machine to you. Maybe it's a Canadian thing. I'm from the states. Enjoyed it and it hit the spot with the group."}
{"text":"Wow! Just what i expected, amazing food, great presentation. The rice pizza cakes are bomb! Just dont sit beside the kitchen its kind of annoyoing."}
{"text":"Good sushi for the price. Wouldn't say it's the best I ever had but it's creative and tasty for the price. I would recommend the energy roll, ocean roll and the rocky mountain roll. Torched sushi was also good but tastes like every other place that has torched."}
{"text":"Came here off a recommendation from a friend who claims that this is the best sushi joint in Toronto, and I'm so glad that I did! No, this is not \"cheap\", but you're getting HIGH QUALITY sushi for a very very reasonable price in comparison with other sushi spots in Toronto. The special rolls are only $11-$13!!! Whaaaaat... These are practically food court sushi prices at 10x better quality.  Corn Karaage: Looks and sounds better than it tasted tbh since I had such high expectations lol but still yummy. I wish it was cut into smaller pieces so that it would be more crunchy and crispy.  Tako wasabi: Basically octopus with wasabi sauce. Comes with seaweed which you're supposed to wrap it with. Also yummy though I wish they put a bit less wasabi since my wasabi-tolerance is low  Panko soft shell crab: huge portion but not worth in my opinion. Kinda dry.   Ocean dream roll: my FAVOURITE ROLL. The cucumber on top of the roll was so refreshing and it was a nice change from all the other sushi  Lion king roll: this was my friends favourite roll. Has tuna, potato garnish, and avocado, so you already know it's gonna be creamyyyyy  Premium sashimi platter: presented beautifully and came with my favourite things ever: shrimp, scallop, and Uni (lots of it). I was happy with this.  Assorted Aburi sushi set: 12 pieces of torched sushi for only 22$ WHAT. So tasty. This is a must try and a big reason for the 5 stars.  Salmon pressed sushi: Creamy. This is a staple  Green tea-ni: tasted like Arizona green tea but with a hint of alcohol. I liked this and would order this again next time. Never had any alcoholic drink like this!  Service: the bartender was very friendly and greeted us when we came in and again when we left. Our server was kinda curt but still provided good service. No complaints   All in all, check this place out if you love Japanese food!! I will definitely be returning for that assorted Aburi set and to try more items :)"}
{"text":"This place has great lunch and weekday specials. The food is satisfying and the service is always friendly.   If you are a takoyaki lover, try the takoyaki - I think this place might have the best takoyaki I've tried in Toronto so far! This was the first place to not disappoint.     I've been here 4 or 5 times so far and I've tried some of the special rolls, spicy rolls, sashimi, aburi, takoyaki, gyoza, korroke and yaki udon. The korroke and yaki udon stood out as especially tasty! Nothing was bad, but the aburi was pretty underwhelming compared to the standard aburi (at Miku, Minami, or Jabistro)."}
{"text":"Perfect place for good value, good quality sushi that will fill you up without putting a hole in your wallet. All of the sushi/sashimi was fresh and flavourful,  especially the scallop sashimi included in the daily sashimi platter which also had Hamachi and ebi that day. The chef's sushi selection was a great way to have a bit of everything including several torched pieces. As for rolls we ordered a volcano roll and a spider roll. With its crunchy texture, the volcano easily lived up to my expectations based on all the other reviews while the spider fell short,  being just standard among many others made around the gta.  Service was great from start to finish,  although the drinks did take a while to come considering it was a quiet Sunday night."}
{"text":"Saku is home to some of the best sushi I've had in Toronto.   The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was quite personable.  I ordered the sushi dinner set and received a generous portion for $21+tax. We also got the Saku roll and Aburi sushi as a side. All were melt-in-your-mouth delicious and well worth the price. I would definitely come back. Highly recommend the Saku roll and Aburi.   In addition, the decor is what sets this place aside. It's a bit different, dark and hipster. It feels like a dive bar, and they play a variety of music. Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Solid sushi restaurant. Within budget for not ayce!   Fast and friendly service. Unique rolls. Neat decor. Surprised I haven't discovered it before!  The sushi rolls are pretty unique and they got all sorts of interesting tastes to it. And they also have a lot of very interesting appetizers. We got the eggplant appetizer and it was very delicious!!"}
{"text":"Excellent variety in menu and beautiful decor. The prices were, surprisingly, low and comparable to other sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"What to try?  Their special rolls.   We came here the second time and I have to say the special rolls are great choices if you want something light but tasty. Remember the yelp discount!  We tried the volcano roll and the Atlantic queen. They're not too out of the ordinary or too extravagant, but you get a good amount of the roll - 8 pieces!   For the price and convenience of the place, it is considered passable! Don't expect too much but don't be surprised you will be getting something the same quality as somewhere else.   The volcano roll had the spicy salmon on top of the sushi which I liked a lot. The crunchy bits were kind of stale though, like it was either fried in old oil or the bits were sitting for weeks! I hope they improve on that.   The atmosphere is generally very nice here. However the tables are relatively close together, so be prepared not to have such an intimate conversation or try to opt for a table booth instead.  Last tip?   Don't forget the yelp discount for checking in because I always forget to show them by the end of the meal! Have it on the table and ready to show! Also the starters are really meant to be starters and not fill you up. Don't be like my friend and was shocked how small his salmon carpaccio salad was! Order more!"}
{"text":"I think I just found my go-to takeout place! Absolutely loved the rolls and sashimi I received. I find it to be a bit overpriced, but overall very good."}
{"text":"Love this place when I'm not hungry enough for AYCE because the rolls have huge and great amount and quality for the price. It's nicely decorated inside with cute booths. For dinner I'd suggest making a reservation so you ensure you get a booth because it's much more intimate. Would strongly recommend the aburi sushi omg. Just melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"This place is great !!! Opted for the dinner special of salmon teriyaki , sashimi and sushi . The quality of the fish was soooo good ( especially the butter  fish). It included a soup and salad . So much food for 22 dollars . We ended our meal with some green tea ice cream .   Overall the service was amazing , the food was great at an amazing price , and i would definitely go back and enjoy the rest of the roll selection"}
{"text":"Good restaurant. Good food, but got too busy during rush hour. There is only one waitress."}
{"text":"OMG? Yum. I ran across this place... (Literally ran across to get out of a thundershower...) I am so glad it started to rain heavy that day because I would have never tried to get out of the rain!   These rolls are THE BOMB. Super friendly service, and I think this place has ruined me for other mediocre sushi. I am constantly thinking about this place if I go to a different sushi place. They have really good daily specials on drinks and I will definitely be back... It's a shame I don't live that close to it."}
{"text":"Soooo Goooood!!! Love their sashimi salad, and lobster roll!!!  Ordered another sashimi salad!!!  Flavour is rich! Atmosphere is cool and dim, service is good."}
{"text":"If you've heard a lot of great things about this place, I can confirm Saku serves some pretty bomb sushi for the price you're paying.   We went on a busy night (New Year's Eye), and they did not have enough chairs for our table. One of the server (or Manager), went back home in the cold and rainy weather to bring extra chairs back to the restuarant to ensure all our party guests were properly seated, and not sitting on the floor. This was too-notch customer service I rarely experience, and our tip reflected that.   If you're looking for a great sushi spot that won't leave a hole in your wallet, this place is definitely worth checking out. For the Instagrammers, be prepared to work with the restaurant's warm and intimately lit ambiance."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here, really great quality, and interesting specialty rolls.  Staff are hit or miss, but the atmosphere and tastiness of the food makes up for it. One of my new favorite places in the city."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi rolls and appetizers, some of the best (for its price) in Toronto! When you go make sure to order the oshi pressed sushi (the salmon is especially good). Atlantic queen and energy are some of my favourites from their special rolls. The takoyaki for an appetizer is always on point. I ordered the agedashi tofu once and was disappointed, the coating of the tofu was mushy and almost like gelatin.   Overall excellent sushi, and very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Will definitely be coming back! The rolls were generous in size, and very creative. The aburi is cheaper than most in the city, but still tastes good - not the best but good for the price. They put sauce and mayo on a lot of the dishes but I am totally okay with that as I love saucy goodness. We ordered the saku roll (a bit tasteless - would not order again), lobster roll (very filling, good buttery taste), torched salmon pressed sushi (my fave) and the chef special aburi (would order again). Split between two people came to ~$30 each (before tip), which I found was very fair for sushi. We were both full and actually had about 6-8 pieces of sushi left to take home. Would recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"Aburi sushi heaven! Saku sushi is a new hipster-friendly restaurant on Queen West that offers quality torched sushi that is both inexpensive and delicious. The music isn't bad either if you're a hip hop aficionado.   We decided to try the Assorted Aburi Sushi after reviewing all our options. The dish came with a variety of fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel) all topped with unique garnishes. They all tasted equally yummy. Not on the same level as Miku and Jabistro, but for this price point you can get your sushi fix without emptying your wallet.   Would come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant that serve some very unique and delicious maki rolls. Quality is better than the average sushi joint in the downtown core. I found the prices to be very reasonable as a result. The place has a chic and casual vibe to it-with dim lighting and top 40 music playing in the background.   My favourite specialty roll here would be their Volcano Roll. They garnish it with fried potato sticks that provide an amazing crunch and texture. Their Spider Roll is also better than average, as it contains perfectly deep fried soft shell crab that you can actually see and taste!   Other items on the menu are also unique and representative of the fusion nature of the cuisine. The Miso Eggplant was a pleasant surprise for an app, as it was a silky and tasty preparation of eggplant that you wouldn't find on most Japanese menus.   They serve aburi sushi here as well which I would describe as being decent. Not the best I've had in this city, but would suffice for any cravings you might have for some blow torched sushi.  All in all, a great spot for fusion maki rolls! As a bonus, you can check in on Yelp to receive 10% off one of their specialty rolls =)"}
