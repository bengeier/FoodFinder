{"text":"Food, service, and atmosphere - all worth going out of your way for!  Check out the bocce ball dessert - made on site. Delicious!!  The fireplace was gas. I prefer wood-burning, but otherwise it was everything I expected."}
{"text":"Awesome building, extremely poor service. Kind of cancel each other out. Would go again and put up with the bad service."}
{"text":"Not sure why someone said the place is filled with \"no locals\" because I met more than a handful when I visited. Food is good, be sure to check our specials. Bocce Ball and the patio are my favorite when I visit. Be sure to check out this gem in Gordon Square."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and nice people. I would go back any time. If you get a chance play bocce ball."}
{"text":"Food is good, the patio is great but the service is sub-par.  Lack of follow up from the server to order to refresh drinks, check in to see if everything is ok or if anything is needed.  The food runner just brings the food out and places it in front of you even if it not yours.  We had to hunt someone down to get the check and still had to wait forever! Food would be a 5 stars, service is 1 star"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks. Food can be hit or miss. Great decor. Good atmosphere. service can be bad, but it can also be good. I would avoid food and have drinks."}

{"text":"Two words: Stay. Away.  What a terrible experience. To preface, I've worked in the food service industry. This was by far the worst experience I recall having, and the first time I've left without leaving a tip.   Problem #1: We showed up on time with reservations for 7:30. We'd asked for the patio. When we checked in they informed us that they don't reserve space on the patio. This would have been useful information when the reservations were made and the person on the phone said it wouldn't be a problem to be seated on the patio.  Problem #2: They weren't ready for us when we got there. It was Sunday evening. I'm not sure how you can take reservations, and not be ready when a group arrives. We ended up sitting at the bar while they took over 40 minutes to find a space (that had been available from the time we walked in) to seat us.   Problem #3: While at the bar, I ordered an Old Fashioned. The bartender, who splashed liquid all over anyone in the \"Splash Zone\" (this area being located anywhere along the bar) gave me his version of an Old Fashioned. Bourbon garnished with an orange and a cherry. It was pathetic. I tried paying him several times, but he never showed me the attention to even get paid, so I didn't pay for it.   Problem #4: We were finally seated nearly an hour after arriving, again, in an area that had been available from the time we had arrived. It. Was. Stiffling. No AC. No fans. We were right by the kitchen. Very uncomfortable. We kept out menus to fan ourselves.   Problem #5: The waitress finally took our drink order nearly an hour after we'd arrived. When you order pop there, it comes in a 7.7 oz can. You have to open and pour your own. They charge per can; no free refills like every other restaurant anywhere.   Problem #6: The menu was tiny (less than 10 items). Before we ordered, the waitress (whose poor service I'll address later) informs us that nearly half the items are unavailable, but that more expensive options were. One appetizer that cost about $9 was gone, but there was an $18 replacement. Some people call that bait-and-switch. Others, fraud.  Problem #7: This was the first of our problems with our waitress. We had a party of only ten. We asked for separate checks. This would have led to five separate checks, total. She informed us that it would just be \"too much work\" for her, and that at most she'd do three separate checks. This was when I decided she'd be getting less than 15% for a tip. As a former server, I learned you don't inconvenience the table. Had she split up the check as we'd asked, she would have scored at least 20% from me.  Problem #8: One member of our party had ordered soup. She asked that it be brought out before her meal. The waitress informed us she was too busy (there was only one other group seated in our area, and the patio was not busy), and that she wouldn't bring the soup out early because it was \"just too crazy.\" Again, I've worked in food service. You know how to serve soup? You pour a ladle-sized scoop in a bowl, put it on a plate with some crackers, and take it out. It's not rocket science, and it takes 45 seconds.   Problem #9: The restaurant wasn't busy. No one in our group ordered anything complicated. With the exception of one burger, everything was wraps and salads. It took over an HOUR to get our food out. I've made salads and wraps. It doesn't take long. By the time our food came out, we'd already been there TWO AND A HALF HOURS.   Problem #10: Our waitress was remarkably inattentive. Drinks sat empty.   Problem #11: When the food came, it was unexceptional. Mostly bland and flavorless. Several items had to be sent back because they were sitting on an unheated area of the dining counter and were cold.   Problem #12: Their home fries, which I'd paid an extra $3.50 for, were freezing. They also weren't home fries.   Problem #13: When my salad arrived, I was informed no eggs were on my salad (they were out). The only things listed as being on the salad on the menu were eggs, bacon, tomato, and dressing. I'd like to know ahead of time, if not shortly after I place my order that 25% of the ingredients are missing.  Problem #14: After spending nearly 3 hours there, mostly waiting to eat and sweating, we finally got the bill. Just one check. The waitress told us we could split it up ourselves. For ten people. One member of our party took the 20 minutes to do what our waitress couldn't while we waited nearly 90 minutes for our food. During this time, she repeatedly came to the table to see if he was done, and smirked over at us from the corner while she stood around doing NOTHING.   Problem #15: This was for a birthday, and we'd brought cupcakes. They tried to charge a cake-cutting fee. FOR CUPCAKES.  What a poorly-run business. Doesn't honor reservations, give proper service, or serve good food or alcohol, but will try to charge bogus fees. I'm glad they didn't have a mandatory tip. We left none. Will never return again. Stay away!"}
{"text":"This is two stars for one reason.  The service is terrible.  The good: The atmosphere is amazing.  Clearly, the owners spent a zillion bucks turning this into a great place to sit with your mates and have a pint, maybe listen to a traditional band.  The patio is incredible!  The carved stone seats and tables are just incredible masonry work.  The food is pretty tasty.  My friend got a French bread pizza with pepperoncini and pepperoni (more on this later) and a pint of Guinness. By all accounts, it was tasty, very zesty, but not uncomfortably so.  I ordered the turkey club sandwich which was very good.  The turkey was real slices of roasted and then grilled turkey, not some shady luncheon meat crap, and the bread was thick, crusty goodness.  It also comes with bacon, 2 kinds of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo.  Very tasty, if a bit hard to eat...it's a very tall sandwich.  The Odd:  The sides available are kind of strange...specifically, they don't have french fries for their sandwiches or burgers.  There are \"homefries\" that were crispy, lacking salt, and just strange.  When I asked our waitress, \"you don't have french fries?\"  she replied, \"we don't have a deep fryer.\"  Which I though was odd.  A pub that ignores the Fryolated Arts (thank you, Tony Bourdain!) is strange to me. But whatever...when in Rome.    The bad:  While I cannot speak for the bar or inside seating, the service on the patio is horrible.  When we arrived, our waitress spilled a glass of water on the table.  No big deal, right?  She apologized for the error and disappeared for 20 minutes.  When she finally came back, I asked \"Are there any specials tonight?\"  A perfectly reasonable restaurant question.  As if she was burdened to answer the question, she replied, \"Ha...yah...ah..NOPE!\" and walked away.  Finally, she came back, took our drink orders and 15 minutes later, they arrived.  As we had plenty of time to make our selections, we said, \"OK, we're ready to order, too.\"  She sighed loudly, and walked away, to return another 10 minutes later.  My sidekick ordered his \"pepperoni and pepperoncini pizza,\" and due to the challenges of alliteration, tripped over the word \"pepperoncini.\"  The waitress, clearly some sort of linguistics expert, again let out a very annoyed *SIGH* and said, \"Just so you know, it's pronounced \"pepper-on-CHEE-nee.\"  That was it for me.   I finished my meal and drink, and voted my displeasure with the gratuity, or lack thereof.  I personally do NOT believe the axiom \"The customer is always right.\" In fact, when I was a waiter in high school and college, I know the customer is seldom right...you just don't ever make them feel like they're wrong.  If I wanted service this bad, I would have gone to \"Dick's Last Resort\" in the Flats, circa 1999.  Great atmosphere, decent grub, but the service is so overwhelmingly bad, take your pub dollar to any of the other Irish pubs on the West Side.  It'll be much more appreciated."}
{"text":"I don't think I came on a particularly good day at all. I don't know why there's such a hype about this place other than the location. When we went into the restaurant, I was pretty disappointed in the fact that there was a wait. I definitely wasn't in the mood for a wait, and I was having some major back pain from the bench inside. Then, we were seated outside on the patio. The stone seating and tables were awful for my back and completely threw off my night. I guess that appeals to some people because it's unique, but I was really uncomfortable and in pain the whole night.  The service was so-so. We were at the restaurant far too long because the service was so slow. When the servers arrived with our food, I was pretty disappointed in it. My salad was pretty good and I'm glad they had a good selection of salads. However, the pizza everyone raves about was dry and burnt. I split a small pizza with another person and we couldn't finish it because we didn't like it at all. The crust was awful and the toppings didn't make up for it. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. At least there was great parking!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Bar! Amazing stonework and intricate tile work in bathrooms and beautiful designs in the bar.  Too bad that was all tarnish by the terrible, apathetic, and down right horrible service.   I went with my mother and her friend for cocktails before actually going to a place with good food.  They wouldn't let us pick any table in the EMPTY patio. The waitress was inattentive but the lady constantly cleaning our appetizer plates off was buzzing around us. I actually had to tell her to go away because she was trying to clear my plate with food still on it. The cocktails were mediocre, the waitress didn't know what my drink was (dark and stormy) a fairly common drink, and tried to persuade me to change. She then charged me for each individual ingredient in the drink totaling $9. I asked her about her butchered bill and she just argued with me. Needless to say the tip reflected the service... I'll never be back and left livid.  I'm not hard to please, but common decency was lacking in every aspect of that sad excuse for a pub.   If you go... Go sit at the bar, the bartenders are friendly and helpful. Otherwise you'll have to deal with brain dead bitter waitresses."}
{"text":"The snow covered patio was scary to me reminded me of cemetery headstones. Two bartenders and an overgrown stationary bar-back to serve a just a few folks. Lovely hand blown glass behind the bar with the exception of the added disco-ball. Lazy music was supplied by an ipod behind the bar. Thank goodness Austin \"Walkin' Cane came in with his guitar and harmonica. Lots of imported beer by the bottle. Two bottles of beer + two draft beers= $18.00 before tip."}
{"text":"Stone Mad is one of those gems that are popping up in that area of Cleveland right now... as long as you're looking for a drink at the bar or a game of bocce ball. The drinks are good, decent selection of beers (not great if you are into the stouts or nitrogen tap beers). The interior is gorgeous, with an Irish-themed bar and dining space with a fireplace to the Italian-cafeteria themed back dining room with the bocce court.  And that's where the appeal ends. I went to Stone Mad for dinner twice (disclosure: i'm a fish-eating vegetarian), and the food is atrocious.   1) they have 2 items on the menu that are pescatarian-friendly: a salad, and the Catch of the Day. I've now had both of those items, neither impressed, least of all the CoD which wasn't cooked thoroughly.  2) And what of my carnivorous friends? Here was their experience: - another salad, with egg and beacon, looked good, but there was too much lettuce and the dressing was watery and flavorless - steak - you are presented with a piece of meat (though it WAS yummy) on a plate, with a knife. There is no sauce. There is no side. NONE. Who serves a hunk of meat without at least a small scoop of mashed potatoes or fries?????  - chicken wrap - this was decent and came with a side of coleslaw and french fries, which were just OK. No major complaints there.  So overall, if you are going for a drink, and to enjoy their beautiful stone patio, then do go. But not for dinner."}
{"text":"The food, drinks and staff was really nice. A nice environment for anyone. I will definitely go back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Just had the pork sausage and wild mushroom French bread pizza off the happy hour menu for $5.00.  It was excellent.  The bread was light and crispy, and the meat and mushrooms were plentiful.  The French bread pizza had a nice tangy mild spice to it that was excellent.  Yumm"}
{"text":"For a truly disgusting dining experience, be sure to visit the Stone Mad Pub on w.65th in Cleveland. Tonight, I attended their \"clam bake\" with family. Recently, at \"Oysterfest\" held there, (luckily manned by mostly outside vendors) I made the grave mistake of getting a last-minute burger from them, and was treated to a pasty, pink-slime-esque, incomprehensively greasy slab on an ice-cold bun coated with a layer of pus-like white cheese- the \"only way it's available\" according to the \"chef.\" \"If you don't like it, scrape it off!\" I was told. But that's another story...  Tonight was no better. Strike that- FAR worse... The clams were obviously microwaved to warm them up because I had to spit out most of them I tried due to extreme toughness and dryness- like old, cold chewing gum. The clam broth was grey and impossibly, shockingly salty and devoid of flavor. The chicken was also lacking in seasoning and disappointingly dry and old-tasting, like wet cardboard. This trait was shared by my wife's bland, tough steak, (ordered med and delivered rare) which she sent back because she couldn't even cut it- WITH HER STEAK KNIFE. She then waited an additional half-hour for another that was basically the same. the rest of us had long since finished eating (what we could.) No apology offered by staff. I might add, the one ounce of steak sauce she recieved was so vile (like ketchup, mustard, and cigarette ashes mixed together) that we had to stop at at Starbuck's to get something to cleanse our pallettes. (Now THAT'S desperate.) Not including drinks, our tab was over 77 bucks. The waitress apologized, and suggested we talk to the owner, Pete. \"No,\" I replied, noting he was drinking and entertaining friends on his indoor bocce court, \"looks like he's busy...\" Besides, if he cared about what customers thought, things would've gotten better over the past couple of years. (A friend of mine was the chef there, but he left because of \"creative differences with the owner.\" Yeah...) Anyway- Moral of story: DON'T GO THERE... EVER!!  PS- Various other things: Brisket- overpriced and underseasoned. Wine pours- averaging around $9.00 per (!!) in a working-class neighborhood. Our server, (sarcastically) \"You pay for the ambiance.\" Wink-wink. Pickles on the table instead of bread/rolls?? Perfect with wine/beer- if you want to vomit before dinner, that is."}
{"text":"For one, the patio is amazing. Celtic- inspired and gorgeously lit by a fire, it's a sure place to visit during the summer.   The happy hour menu is delicious and very cheap. Expect $5 food & beer/drinks; unfortunately it is only available at the bar, which I feel is the only draw back. The food during regular hours is decently priced and delish as well! Try the mac n cheese, it's one of my favs along with their burgers.  The staff is friendly, helpful and cute! Becoming a 'regular' at this bar is not hard when it has such a 'local pub' feel!  One of my favorite places in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I have been to Stone Mad several times, and have yet to have a bad experience. All my friends and I love the fact they use fresh food, and don't have a deep fryer and microwave. Anyone can cook french fries, and you can get them anywhere, so it's refreshing to go to a place that doesn't put them with the burgers.  Their sandwiches are pretty good, and i think their seafood linguine is great. The burgers are fantastic, and most would agree, pretty big!!  The ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic, still wanting to play bocce ball on that court. But I have had the bocce ball dessert, and it was pretty good!   I recommend to everyone I talk to!"}
{"text":"I so wanted Stone Mad to be better.  We live only a few hundred yards away and watched the construction with excitement.  However, we hardly ever go there despite the close proximity.  On the good side: The space is beautiful with all the glass and stone work reflecting an artisan spirt that you just don't see in new build anymore.  A summer drink on the pation is relaxing and refreshing.  But the bad outweighs.  Mostly I guess it just has a weird vibe.  The service is pretty consistently slow, but there's something more than that....hard to put a finger on but .... vaguely unwelcoming.  A door guy who seems both overly familiar and subtly hostile simultaneously.  And the food.  OK.... but as many others have noted.... the home fries just aren't very good.  Just get some french fires already.   You'll catch me here 4-5 times a year. Drinks only. Summer only.  But I won't go if I expect to need table service for food or in the winter."}
{"text":"Friends brought me to Red Stone for my birthday.  It was a great time.  I have no complaints. The kitchen made an error but then generously over compensated for their mistake. I was amazed by how seriously they handled their error. Even the cook came out to apologize.  I like the place and I certainly intend to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Stone Mad Pub today for lunch. We were very pleased with the food &  service. The food we ordered was excellent. Best Corned Beef sandwich in town!! We will be back with friends !"}
{"text":"The only redeeming thing about this place was the amazing device from Emma and remarkable atmosphere.  Let me say how excited I was to go to stone mad tonight for the first time, the weather was fantastic and I was totally looking forward to a great patio experience. Well let's just says that didn't happen on any level!  It started when Emma brought my first glass of wine clearly under poured so I ordered another the next glass came out more than double the size of the first one ! Then after sitting at the table for more then an hour for food Emma came over and explained the kitchen was very swamped due to a huge reservation and she was so sorry that our appetizer has still not come out and it had been over an hour. My thought is if you know you have a big reservation then call in more staff. Finally at an hour an fifteen minutes our appetizers arrive some pathetic cold excuse for a pork slider not even one bite on our food came that clearly had been sitting in a window or on a grill side for a long period of time. Needless to say the manager comped only the appetizer I payed almost $100 for food and and all around evening I hated!  There are plenty of patios in Cleveland do yourself a favor skit stone mad the only thing it will make you is being mad after a BAD experience !!!"}
{"text":"Ok overall loved this place! I loved how it felt a little hidden and magically sort of Harry Potter dark In a cool way. Prices higher than the average pub but the food was excellent. Loved the little pickles they brought to th table. Had the salmon and cream corn both were great. It was a little loud in the back dining area which I didn't like. I feel like that part was made for dinner and the bar atmosphere shouldn't have been so dominant. The service was good. Waitress very friendly and timely. Overall a cool place!!"}
{"text":"I strictly come here for the pecan bourbon with ginger beer. Aside from this, I would come for the ambiance - not the food. The patio is pretty sweet. Anyways, I recently added a puppy to the mix. Many patios in the Gordon square area are dog friendly. I walked the pup here for a drink and when asking if they allowed dogs on the patio, the waiter was aggressively rude. It's cool - but no need to be a jerk. Not puppy friendly. Moving on....won't return."}
{"text":"ignore the groupon review. If you are using groupon you don't care about anything other than free (note: i have no issue with budget hawks just freeloaders who complain)   the trout is AWESOME! the mac & cheeze kick ass! the whole menu is amazing. simply & very tasty. if you have a problem with your meal let your waitress know. they are patient & understanding. PLEASE NOTE: the food takes TIME!!!! if you are looking for a run & go beer & burger joint go somewhere else! you will ruin my time. this is a nice place to go to enjoy company & go out. time tables will ruin your evening. don't come bitching here about it either you have been warned.  also the outside fills up FAST! plan ahead & you'll be happy with the results.  be sure to order any appetizer! right portions & great timing every time.  peace!"}
{"text":"I went here to enjoy the patio on a lovely fall day with some work friends and it was great. We got happy hour prices inside at the bar and sat outside to enjoy the great weather. The staff was super attentive and the prices were great for happy hour. The pub had a great Irish-feel, and did I mention how great the patio was? When we got hungry, we went inside and grabbed some happy hour specials from the bar. I share a pizza and some cheesy potatoes with my friend, and I can't say it enough about the cheesy potatoes - they were the best potatoes I have ever had in my life. The only reason I am giving it 4/5 is because the happy prices were only at the bar inside and not on the patio, and we were resigned to like 2 high top tables on the patio because we weren't getting served because we wanted happy hour prices."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5...well, but maybe the full 4, because I had, overall, a 4-star night even though it wasn't fully Stone Mad's doing (I was with a great group, and....heavily imbibed!).  Good for a group outing when you aren't really on a time crunch and want to partake of the Detroit-Shoreway area.  Pros: -Open, expansive atmosphere. Many rooms, one of which boasts bocce ball but I did not lay my eyes on it. -It has one of those distinctive \"good smells\" (not sure of what: mussels? bread? butter sauce?) that permeated the place. -There is a parking lot, although it was too crowded for us to find a spot. -Pickles for the table! -A number of good beers on draft and even more in bottles. -Delicious appetizers: try the brie (OMG), the banana peppers, and the (grilled) buffalo tenders. -Seafood special--linguine with shrimp, mussels, and scallops--was finger-licking good.  Not that I ate the pasta with my hands.  I did use (and lick) my hands, however, while eating the deliciously garlicky bread it came with. -Affordable. -Really nice bathroom! -Just an overall good atmosphere, an attentive bartender, nice stained glass windows, and a waiter whose face didn't ENTIRELY give away how impatient he was with us.  Cons: -An hour and a half wait.  Are you kidding me?!?!  This caused me to probably order much more to drink than I needed, so I didn't really notice it.  But it was in the back of my mind. -We were cranky when we finally did get a table so it was rough-going (see above re: waiter) until we got some apps in our gullets. -They were out of about half the beers requested by us -- mostly seasonal Oktoberfests.  This caused a loud clamor at our table, and the ladies had to shush the men.  Embarrassing but funny. -Not a huge selection of food.  Also a rather limited selection of wine, from what I saw on the menu. -NO FRIES.  Kill me now.  According to the waiter, they had no deep-fryer (and no microwave, not like I care about that), and everything is made to order.  Good concept...but bad when you consider the lack of yummy deliciousness they could put out and don't.  They had home fries.  Fail.  whatever.  I like them for breakfast, but not alongside my burger.  Oh, and they were extra, of course."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this bar and I absolutely LOVE their patio.   The food is hit or miss- some items are delicious and other items are lackluster. I don't understand how an Irish Pub has italian food items on their menu (at least on their HH menu)? I think this is where I was a bit thrown off."}
{"text":"I really want to like it more than I do. The food is fantastic! As others have mentioned, they have great happy hour specials. And, the patio is one of the best in the area.  However, I feel the need to call out the service. Every time I go it is inconsistent. We are either waiting forever for someone to take our drink order. Or, we have 4 different people coming by to check on us.   There seems to be general nervousness about service, as if no one knows how to best create an enjoyable environment for the customers. I've observed servers being herded and reprimanded by management on multiple occasions, which just gives the whole place a feeling of stress and everyone is on edge.  My advice to the management - loosen up a bit. I really want to come and just relax, but it's hard when you and the staff are so wound up."}
{"text":"Ever since my stint in a Bocce league, I have been a fan. Stone Mad gets 4 stars just for that. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is I have not tried their food. Also, there is something cold about the place. I just never feel completely at ease. There isn't anything wrong with that, but I just generally like warmer places. Everything is quality about this place, from the patio, to the handcrafted bar, to the wait staff.   Stone Mad is for grown-ups looking for a fun, yet sophisticated experience.  They have cider on tap."}
{"text":"I'm stingy with the 5 stars, but after a series of terrible Cleveland restaurant experiences this place was a real breath of fresh air!  We came for lunch on a weekday and there was almost no one else there, but we didn't mind. If it had been warmer we would have sat on their awesome patio. We had a turkey club and a burger, as well as a few beers. The food was excellent. It was the first time in a long time that I actually felt like it was worth paying to eat out! Our server was friendly, drinks were great, the place was cool.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly service with Irish flair. This place has great food and some killer lemonade. I have been here on several occasions and it has yet to disappoint. The salmon BLT and buffalo pizza are some fan favorites when it comes to the food menu and there are even more favorites when it comes to specialty cocktails.  Also who doesn't love a happy hour from 4-7 with drinks specials and some killer apps.  This spot is especially ideal for summer days. Their stone patio is one of the coolest around and has ample seating. Or stop by during the colder months and enjoy their cozy interior. This Irish pub is tucked away from main roads but is well worth a visit."}
{"text":"The place is cool but the food is boring.  Nothing special about it. It wasn't bad but it just wasn't good either.   Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was so jazzed about trying out Stone Mad on our Thursday night date night (before catching a showing of Jurassic Park at Capitol Theatre) and even more jazzed that we had time to have the whole \"Stone Mad Experience\" - from patio, to food, to the crazy cool potty in the basement, to oh yes, bocce ball. It was lovely.  First things first: parking. When we got there it was kinda early (6ish) and I noticed a number of spots out front on the street - some of them would have required parallel parking - but that's no big. We ended up parking in Capitol's lot (probably would not suggest this on busier nights because its rude to steal other people's spaces, but I figured we were headed over after dinner so why not).  As we sauntered down w.65th toward Stone Mad it was a scorcher - must have been at least 90 degrees and some ridiculously high level of humidity - so we decided to have a drink at the bar before grabbing something to eat on the patio. We entered through the front door - and as per usual I was confused, do I push, do I pull, do I bust through with both arms? It was like a swinging door type thing but with two sides and I must have looked like a fool trying to make my way through. Once inside there wasn't like a hostess, just the bartender, and a few people milling around the gorgeous warm toned wooden bar, the place just felt very authentic.  They had some happy hour pricing going on so I had an unauthentically Irish rum and diet and the boy toy ordered up some of his favorite, Strongbow. As we sat chatting at the bar I noticed other people were coming in and making their way to the back of the restaurant to seat themselves. To make truly sure it was a \"seat yourself\" type deal we asked the bartender and he said that was cool for inside but that outside there was probably someone to seat you. We picked up our drinks and headed back through the restaurant to make our way to the patio. We were greeted with even more beautiful, warm, and inviting woodwork with cozy little tables spread about. Making our way through the side entrance we headed out to the patio - greeted with a beautiful stone fireplace, plenty of stone seating, and a waterfall. We were given the option to seat ourselves and chose a nice shaded area toward the back of the patio. Was such a great atmosphere that even in 90 degree weather - it was still enjoyable. We then ordered a couple more drinks - a blueberry thrill for me (Stoli Blueberry vodka infused with fresh lemonade, shaken and trimmed with fresh blueberries) and another Strongbow for the man. With our drinks came a cup of pickles - a few tiny ones, a few regular slicked dill spears - I was loving it. Since we had a lot of time before the movie we decided to space out our meal and ordered the Stuffed Peppers (peppers stuffed with chorizo, served atop house made marinara sauce) as an appetizer - so yum. Once it came down to our dinner selections we decided to share and ordered up a Turkey Club (hand carved turkey, with bacon, Irish cheddar, havarti, lettuce, tomato, and mayo), the Famous Beef Brisket (slow roasted, hand-carved, and served on a dusted roll with horseradish sauce and au jus), some creamy mascarpone polenta, and home fries. Everything was delectable.  After dinner we were dying for some A/C so we paid our bill and made our way back inside to take another look around. Since it was pretty empty, we made our way to the back to check out the bocce court. I was super excited because nobody was playing and there was only one table of four seated back there so I wouldn't be embarrassing myself in front of too many people with my poor bocce ball handling skills. I asked one of the waitresses if we were allowed to just play, and she said \"of course!\" so we (drinks in hand, since the sign doesn't forbid it) headed into the court. Of course the boy and I had to google bocce ball rules (thank god for iPhones!) and after some reading up on it decided that we didn't have to be too technical about it. And in case you're wondering - you're supposed to take the smaller ball (the pallina) have someone throw it (underhand only) and then try to get the bigger balls (each team has four) closest to the pallina without touching it or hitting the back wall (alternating turns). Whoever ends up with the closest ball (or balls) to the pallina scores points. Long story short, the boyfriend ended up beating me (but not by much!).  Since I had perused Yelp before coming down - I knew I had to check out the amazing downstairs bathroom before we headed down to the theatre. I just had to figure out how to get there first. So, we ended up asking the bartender and were told that \"its the coolest thing about the place\" and then pointed in the right direction (you get to the stairs through the front bar area to the left of the door that leads back to the dining area). The bathroom is as cool as the pictures make it look.  All in all, great Irish experience. We shall return. Sláinte, Stone Mad!"}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience the other day. The service was excellent (Thanks Pat) and the burgers are outstanding. So far my favorite burgers in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love the terrace, the drinks, the super sweet staff and the cobb salad with Salmon. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"The patio is beautiful and the inside is gorgeous. The drink menu is impressive.   . The burgers were delicious and this was the first time I had a burger cooked exactly how I wanted. Melt in your mouth burger! We thought they gave us two but they did split the burger. If u order the full burger it's 12oz! If u split its two 1/3 lb. burgers  I gave them a four because they brought us two burgers instead of the one like we asked but truthfully it should be a 4. 9 stars. We will be back in cooler weather to play bocce for sure and can't wait to enjoy the patio again real soon."}
{"text":"Although beautiful this place lacks one important factor...... great bartenders. I expect to walk into an Irish themed bar and at least have smalltalk with the staff. We were served our drinks and that was it, the bartenders seemed more intent on nursing their hangovers than earning their tips. As a worker in the service industry it's Bartending 101... guess they missed that class."}
{"text":"A pricey but incredibly charming pub in a great neighborhood!    I had no idea that this place existed and it's tucked away in a neat little pocket of Cleveland. The inside is BEAUTIFUL and there is a nice, big selection of draft beers. They were, however, quite pricey. We had 4 beers and the tab came to almost $30 with tip.. Not the best price.   The best thing about this place is the bocce ball court in the back! This place is quite big and definitely an older crowd but very neat. We met one of the owners and he was very polite and friendly. Their patio looks AWESOME but it was very cold when we went. I plan on going back in the spring, for sure. We were told they'll be expanding and opening a cheaper pub behind it, with $2 beers, so I'm excited for that as well!   I did not try the food but the menu looked pretty good so I plan on going back for dinner sometime but anticipate a big bill!"}
{"text":"Dear Stone Mad,  Please add something vegetarian to your menu. My husband and friends love visiting the fireplace on your concrete patio, playing bocce ball in the back, and sampling the variety of great Irish beers you have on draft.   I adore you as well and would have given you a 4 or even a 5 if there was something besides salad for me eat.   Some friends and I spent last St. Patrick's Day on the patio and enjoyed the sunshine and fun loving energy of the crowd. The patio was full of friends and families taking in the great atmosphere and live music.   Have I mentioned the awe struck beauty of the bathrooms? Yes I said bathrooms. Beautifully pristine antique tiling in both the men's and women's. At a recent visit, both of our guests came out of the restrooms remarking, \" Have you been in there? They are so neat!\"  You are a favorite destination for a great patio night. I love the energy o the place, but you menu leaves me hungry.   Cheers! Angeline"}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious food, nicest bartenders around (Nick, Joe, Pat, Jared all the best) and the patio is the coolest. Recommend the pizza and whatever their daily special is."}
{"text":"Nice place poorly run. My wife and friend just left after being rudely hit on and offended by a regular.  The bartender and manager were informed multiple times and did nothing until a third woman complained.  Poor management."}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for a late Sunday lunch. It was fairly quiet/slow when we arrived at 2:00pm but that quickly changed when people started to gather for bocce. Definitely avoid the back room if you have any hope of holding a conversation.  The service was good. It was an odd arrival due the layout - basically no hostess stand so you have to find a server or catch the bartender's attention to be seated.  They had a decent selection of beers, and I have the Monks Sour Ale a try. I'm not normally a beer drinker, but I've liked the lambics  I've tried. I will definitely be enjoying the Monks again. They also had a small selection of wines and ciders, which is cool. The menu is impressive and my companions loved the peppadew soup, salads, and macaroni and cheese. I was torn and decided on two appetizers to try: the Brussel sprouts and the brisket tacos. The sprouts were amazing! They are lightly roasted and tender, served with bacon, goat cheese and balsamic. The brisket tacos were a total fail for me. The horseradish was just so overwhelming.  Service was fine. The decor was interesting. Inside you definitely get the Irish pub feel, until the bocce room.  The patio is impressive with stone tables and seating around a stone fireplace. There's some interesting ironwork as well. But the bathrooms downstairs steal the show. The most stunning tile work I've seen in these parts. Even if you don't need to use the facilities, you should make a point of checking out the loos. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"First I have to say that our server Michelle was great!  Attentive, pleasant, helpful and just very adept at her job.  The place is nice- patio is awesome, but definitely tight and on the small side.  Inside is dark wood, great light fixtures, pleasant atmosphere.  Food suffers a bit- the mussels were very good, and please do ask for more bread than they give you with an order.  The pizza we got was not cooked thoroughly- and for having a pizza oven that is just not right!  I don't know if they were rushing them out, or just didn't have enough training.  My salad was ok- missing a couple of ingredients from the menu.  My daughters sandwhich was the same- ok, nothing she would order again.  Others had crab cake, burger, brisket all of which were described as good.  No one raved about anything except the mussels.  I would come back for drinks and atmosphere, but go elsewhere for food since from reviews it appears very unpredictable."}
{"text":"I had to do a wedding today for friends at The Stone Mad Pub. I have to say, I've not seen a more beautiful pub/eatery in a long time.  The place is absolutely awash in warm woodwork that makes you feel like you're in Ireland, and the drink selection (quite extensive) is replete with scotches and interesting concoctions that will tickle the fancy of many a refined palate. The food selection is mostly old world fare, with a few twists; steaks, burgers, and great sides like the apple/fennel coleslaw make it tasty, and on Sundays they have a fascinating brunch menu with things like red velvet pancakes in warm pecan-laced syrup, as well as breakfast sandwiches that are truly impressive.  I was told that one of the owners is a stone cutter, and his skill shows in things like the outdoor stone patio, and the truly AMAZING tile work in the bathrooms. Very nice:)  The service was good, and although the food took a bit, it was very well done and tasty when it arrived. I'm going back to Stone Mad as soon as I can, because it's charms are many, and charmed I was indeed."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio.. Good food.. Too bad the service is terrible!! Server never smiled or introduced himself... Never told us the specials until we asked.. When our food came a girl brought it and I asked her for blue cheese dressing and her response was \"your server will take care of you\"... Everyone pretty much acted like we were a nuisance to be there.  What a waste of a beautiful place"}
{"text":"After bouncing around a few bars, I was hungry and bored. I'm so glad I decided to come here!  There was decent parking, which actually surprised me.  When I went in the side entrance, the waitstaff was extremely nice even though I decided to eat at the bar. I decided to have the daily soup (a bisque with corn and meat) and the daily pizza (goat cheese and bacon!). The food was served very quickly- I think it took the kitchen staff less than a minute to prepare the soup.   The food was really good and definitely worth the price. ($6 and $12, respectively). I decided to try an irish coffee, but it wasn't for me. The care that the bartenders had for promptly and expertly making drinks was nice. They also definitely know their booze!  Overall, this was a great end to an otherwise boring night."}
{"text":"OK the happy hour here is awesome. $3.50 for a cocktail. OMG.The $6 mussels were delicious . Butter, tomato and onion sauce and toast points to soak up the juice. $6 Pizza tasty tasty!!  Nick our bartender is terrific!"}
{"text":"Probably better off just skipping this one all together. Patio very nice, decor is amazing. We came here for my sisters birthday, we had 12 people in our party, had the whole dining room to ourselves. There was only one server on and no other guests on this very slow night. From start to finish it took is 3 hours to be served and they don't split checks if there are more than 10 people. He originally said he would split it 3 ways for us but when it came time to pay it was only one check! So we spend 400 dollars and you make us do all the math splitting what everyone had. I finally go to a \"manager\" but she tells me to wait while she collects all the sugar off the patio. Then is rude when I asked why they just couldn't split the checks. She finally agrees to split them but tells us it's going to take a very long time. She wasn't kidding because 30 min later my family finally got to leave. Finally found out the \"manager\" was the owner. Wow if that's how you run a business I am shocked your still open. Probably just because of the cool decor. The owner originally sat us and never once came to see how everything was. The shame is this place has great potential but lacks anything that is in the guests best Interest. They don't have a website, charge  . 50 for steak sauce on a burger that is tasteless, they don't have bottled ketchup, mustard or mayo! How cheap can you be?? Lastly the customer is always right don't get into a argument with the guest because they want you to do your job and provide a service, because just a reminder  you are in the service industry!"}
{"text":"Great food! Their mac and cheese is superb. Our waitress, Char (?), was excellent! We noticed they grew a few of their own herbs were grown outside. Definitely a nice touch. Only down side was that unfortunately, there was no soap in the women's restroom yesterday."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and probably won't be back. It does have a cool patio, but the food and especially the service are nothing to get excited over. Last time I ate there we had to wait 45 minutes for our appetizer and the waiter didn't apologize or anything. Also, there were maybe about 4 full tables at the time so there was really no excuse. Because there are other good options in the same neighborhood, I'd rather try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Never a bad time here.  Great atmosphere, beautiful room, good food, and reasonable prices.  What more could you ask for.  As far as the one reviewer's comments about the \"Pub\" not being very \"child friendly\", since when was that a function of a Pub??????  Bring the kids to Chucky Cheese if that is what you're after!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! This was my first time here and it was nice to discover that Stone Mad had their own private parking lot. There was even a nice man helping the cars park. I met a few friends there and we were on a waiting list to be seated outside on the patio, so we grabbed drinks at the bar to kill time. We didn't have to wait very long to be seated, which was nice.   THE PATIO WAS AWESOME! The tables are made of stone, hence the name. Super cool idea. The bathrooms are also decked out with an artist's touch of tiled unicorns and such. I enjoyed the decor.  As for the food, also a treat. Loved the Brie appetizer! The Salmon BLT was delicious and the apple fennel cole slaw was also very good. The prices weren't too bad either.  The reason I'm giving Stone Mad 4 out of 5 is because the service was slow as molasses. Also, if you sit outside on the patio, don't plan on inviting anyone else out, bc they don't have extra sitting space and can't bring extra chairs outside. I guess that's what i get for assuming. Bummer..  All in all, I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I think this is one of my favorite places to chill if you'd like to go somewhere with friends. It's a great irish pub with an amazing outdoor patio / fireplace. I think they had an oyster festival here one summer as well.  When you enter, you see the bar, which is made of a dark wood and old world. The middle section is dining / drinks, and the back is an indoor bocce ball court. We always get confused because we order at the bar and try to sit in the middle section (more chill) at a large, beautiful wooden booth, but then we end up ordering appetizers or desserts. The servers really don't like it if you order at the bar and bring it to the middle, though the bartenders say that it's cool. The servers are actually not that hospitable, but we make the best of it. I haven't eaten anything else besides the dessert, which are a 3. The guinness chocolate cake isn't bad.  I can't wait until it gets warmer so that we can hang out on the patio!"}
{"text":"After 3.5 years of construction and 3.5 million dollars of invested capital, Stone Mad has opened (sort of). As of late April, the bar is open but the food is still on hold. The Irish pub is the masterpiece of Pete Leneghan and Eileen Sammon who also own The Treehouse in Tremont.  No corners have been cut, and no expense has been spared. The interior is classy and traditional, with modern accents like hand-blown glass fixtures. The walls are covered in dark wood.  The patio is mind-blowing (and it's still not complete!) It's surrounded by a massive stone wall, the base is stone, and the tables and chairs are (you guessed it) stone! Gates are made of custom wrought iron. And, a massive wood-burning fireplace warms a handful of tables.  Service was top-notch. We chatted with the manager for quite some time and learned the finer details of building an indoor bocce court (by the way, they have an indoor bocce court.) Going well beyond the call of duty, he escorted my group back to our cars at the end of the night.  FYI: According to Elaine Cicora at Scene the name Stone Mad \"comes from a 1977 memoir by Irish stonecarver Seamus Murphy, recounting his seven-year apprenticeship among the country's masons.\""}
{"text":"Food has been good to very good. The hostesses are really rude... Good luck. Wait staff usually helpful. Atmosphere is amazing, very well done, cool. Cooks have difficulty with medium rare meat. Usually overcooked. Brussels sprouts are so yummy!"}
{"text":"LOVE Stone Mad!! Great summer spot for hanging on the patio having a few drinks...also awesome in the winter! Bocci ball court inside is always fun. Also the food and service is always great."}
{"text":"Stone Mad is the type of place you go to for endless conversation and a good social time.I sat and enjoyed the conversation with some people and we could of talked all night.The service is very good and the pizza I had was decent.Stone Mad is a place where you can take a date or a group of friends and talk all night long.I will most def be back in the late fall just because of the patio fire place.Stone Mad is a must on anybodys to do list in northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"I have so many good things to say. Where to begin.  There was about a 45min wait on a Saturday evening. So someone else must like this place too. The waiting is painless though as the bar area in the entrance is just a bar, lots of barstools, a lot of standing room and a little wall shelf running along all the walls so that you can get a drink and sit at the bar or claim a small area of the wall and have somewhere to put all your stuff. I had a winter margarita that was really different and good, the rim was sugar and it was...had to explain but good.  We got seated and there was a fireplace right next to our table to keep us warm. The salmon I got was wonderful and the curried cream corn was so amazing I had everyone else try it.  Once it's warm out I would love to go back and sit outside. They have an area entirely made of stone - the ground, tables, benches everything. And in the middle of this area are multiple fireplaces with big stone chimneys. Apparently some people will even sit out there and drink whiskey by the fire in the cool evenings.  They also have an indoor bocce ball area and an outdoor area in the back. They have bocce ball tournaments there and a trophy by the bar."}
{"text":"Excellent pub with great service, awesome patio, and superb craftsmanship in everything from the stonework, to the stained glass, to the iron gates. Even the bathroom has a crazy amount of detail in it! Have eaten here before and our meals have always been good-especially the pizza and potato leek soup. Try to stop here whenever IMO the area, worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've been to allota bars in my day. Never have I been to a bar so gorgeous. And in Cleveland.   I've heard millions were spent to furnish and decorate Stone Mad. It's obvious where the money went. Even the bathroom tiles will wow you. I've honestly never seen such eye catching bathrooms.   The patio, while not very comfy in the physical sense, was lovely. But yeah, my ass was frozen after sitting on that stone bench for a few hours. The fireplace was delightful and provided the sensory comfort that the stone furniture did not. I couldn't stop staring and marvelling at the gates that enclose the patio.   It's hard to describe the surroundings at Stone Mad in writing. I just won't do the place justice.   Stone Mad has an extensive beer list and friendly staff. It's really a shame that they don't seem to get much business. It was nearly dead on a Friday night. What gives? Could it be the location? Do people not know about it? Very curious. I think you should go and check it out for yourself. It's worth it."}
{"text":"In two words, Absolutely Beautiful. I stopped in after spending an extremely hot afternoon Downtown Cleveland for happy hour. A good friend and I popped in as storm clouds rolled in from the West.   Back to Absolutely Beautiful. The bar from the outside looked like a mini-castle to me. Glimpsed the patio from the street and immediately wanted to sit with a bottle of wine, chess board, and comrade. We stepped into the bar as the rain was coming. Love love love all wooden bars. This one looks as if its been hand-carved from a few giant Sequoia trees.   Wait staff and bartenders were charming and perfectly attentive. I drank Smithwick's and perused the menu. Immediately realizing that I only wanted an appetizer. Everything looked good, yet large and pricey. Ordered the 4oz Filet with Corn Salsa. Was cooked perfectly and tasted really good. Hit the spot with a couple beers.   Crowd is upscale, mature-adult, and locals from the Gordon Square area hang around as well. I will definitely return to try out the patio as well as more of their menu."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and decor in this surprisingly large restaurant. Big patio with stone tables and seating (padded) roaring fireplace, fountain and fairy lights to make a summer evening special. Too bad the smokers ruined it. The smell from those smoking nearby was more than off putting which is why I give this only 3 stars. House salad was decent, would try different salad, side of brussel sprouts with bacon bits and malt vinegar was fair, not too flavorful honestly, side of home fries was forgettable and the braised pork belly over polenta was beautifully presented, the sauce was like bbq sauce with mustard added which was a little disappointing. Our waitress did not come around to check our meal nor check on the status of our drinks; felt we should hurry on out although it was not busy. I'd go again, sit inside and try the daily special."}
{"text":"For pub fare it's a little pricey, but IT'S DELICIOUS!  So, I went post-show on a Thursday night. There were quite a few people but not too crowded. We had a group of 7 and were able o be sat immediately.  The place is awesome, it looks like a real pub and it's deceptively large.  They have a great selection of drinks (wine, beer, and cocktails) and the menu while limited has a little bit of something for everyone.  That night the chef's pizza was artichoke, goat cheese, bacon, and tomato with garlic oil so 5 of us got that. The two others got the burger and the mac'n'cheese. Both looked delicious but this pizza was drool worthy. So good.  Afterwards we got dessert, the coffee creme brulee, the molten chocolate cake with peanut butter ice cream, and the Guiness cake. They were all super yummy. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here as part of a group; we had the bocce court room. Thought the court was a great idea, and the food exceeded my expectations from what I typically expect from a pub. The pizzas were absolutely delicious. I had the crabcake sandwich and was quite satisfied with the quality and taste."}
{"text":"i'm so glad i finally came here! i will be back often. must be back for bocce ball of course, and the patio. wow the patio. our foods: curry creamed corn - the best! brussel sprouts - too vinegary for me, but my friend liked them home fries - perfectly crispy ravioli - yummy, but could use a few more for the price  will def be back. our bartender was super nice too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Restaurant and its atmosphere .. Staff very friendly .. Drinks were good, my Burger was Outstanding, tasted my husbands Beef Brisket and wasn't impressed at all , reminded me of being cooked all day in Grandmas Slow Cooker with potatoes and carrots .. Very disappointed that it wasn't cooked slow and low over a smokey wood with a good rub on it.  The Bocce Ball Cake we shared was delicious and surprisingly light. Enjoyed our dinner, will go back for another burger, or their Cod ~ which the the gentleman sitting at the table next to us said, \"it was really delicious!\""}
{"text":"I recently visited this charming west side pub on a Sunday afternoon. While I loved the outside patio with the concrete seating, we opted to eat inside. I loved the darker atmosphere and we were sat right by the make shift fireplace. I was able to enjoy the nice breeze coming from outside while still feeling toasty.  The menu wasn't as great as the atmosphere but I did enjoy the mussels. My other half decided to go with the chicken legs and corn. While he enjoyed his Guinness, I was disappointed to find that Pinot Grigio was not on their wine list. However I'd go back for the atmosphere any day."}
{"text":"The Pub Spuds are delicious and by far my fave thing on the menu! The staff is very polite. The food is delicious everything everything is pretty fresh and delicious! This by far has one of my fave bathrooms! The tile work is amazing."}
{"text":"I had a date take me here just so I could see the bathroom, and wow, did it deliver! The place is amazingly gorgeous, historical, and cozy. I came here in the wintertime and the large fireplace helped set the mood. Through it was crowded that night, it felt intimate.   Our service was great and the brisket sandwich was melt in your mouth good. Stone Mad is a staple of the area and deserves a visit, even if it is just to see the bathroom."}
{"text":"Went today for happy hour with a group of 6 people around 6pm. The bar was full so we couldn't get seats. Ate on the beautiful patio Instead. Food was very tasteful but took FOREVER to come. Also happy hour pricing is only for the bar, which sucks because the patio is the reason people go there. Overall a great place for dinner but a horrible place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Eat outside on the stone patio on a warm evening.  The inside decor is worth the visit to appreciate."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place.  In the front:  Awesome and knowledgeable bartenders.  Patrick is especially helpful and takes his time to help you find the drink you would like.    The patio?  As said in other reviews....possibly the best in Cleveland.    The food:  Great apps, pizza, entrees, and sandwiches.  We had a family event here in 2012 and the owner was very easy to work with.  Can't say enough, just the best spot for a drink in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Beautiful original interior. Take the tour of the basement and all the rooms. Back room with bocci court and hand painted ceiling is amazing. Get a beer and sit at the original bar. That's all you should do. Flavorless burger is big and juicy but served medium well done regardless of how you order it. Mussels are a little more flavorful but not by much. It's served with two small pieces of overly buttered garlic bread. Two more small pieces will cost you $1.50, which is crazy. Every specialty drink is sugar-based. Staff is nice and service prompt but skip the food."}
{"text":"This review is 100% based off of their staff. I went to this restaurant the other day and was told I could sit on the patio, I had a dog with me and nobody said anything until the server came around. The male server came to our table and the first thing he said was 'dogs are not allowed on this patio, you need to leave'. I've learned now that this is their policy, and I respect that. But I do not respect the way the server delivered this news to us. He was unbelievably rude and not understanding. Unprofessional in every way!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Stone Mad, it was very early October and a perfect night for a fire in the outdoor fireplace. While they normally only do that on the weekends, my friend asked nice and boom... fuego! We had many drinks and an excellent time.   Forward six months to the second visit, this time joined by three lovely Yelpers at our Newbie Event. We were invited to sit at the large half-circle booth near the back (no outside fireplace option this time). Our server was attentive and friendly and I made new friends with the bacon and apple vinegar-sauteed brussels sprouts as well as the incredibly delicious polenta in addition to the Yelp folks.   It's lovely and quiet during the week, the bar is a lovely spot to gather but not really great for groups. It's large, but you'll mostly be standing as the seating is all parameter. If it's nice out, go to the patio. If it's not, stay in because it's really cozy in there."}
{"text":"Strangely enough, I've only been here to drink a few brews, but after my last trip with my neighbors, I can't wait to come back for the food!   First off, the patio is incredible. Winter, summer--it doesn't matter. In fact, my friends say sitting in front of their patio fire place in the winter with some whiskey is probably the one of the coolest things to experience. I've never done this, but it sounds amazing. Obviously an entire patio, furniture and all, made of stone is already amazing. Plus, the fountain is beautiful!  I just can't wait to come back and get my grub on, but make sure it's a cheat day if you're dieting. It's all comfort foods, for the most part. And it's a la cart, so just keep that in mind. I did have a chance to munch on the amazing pickles they set out at the tables--and being a pickle fanatic, I'm sure you can already tell this made me happy.   I have to give 4 stars without trying the food, though. Why? Because just grabbing a beer or cocktail on their patio is worth the rating."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food, can't wait to enjoy the patio next summer.    Woodwork and tile in this place is absolutely incredible.  What a great place.  Drinks were great, Guinness was perfect."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Stone Mad Pub.  It was another cold Cleveland winter day, but being seated next to the fire, I felt like I was at a ski lodge surrounded by the dark wood furnishings.  Service was a little on the slow side, but well worth the wait for the thick-patty Stone Mad Burger, which definitely qualifies as one of the better burgers I've had in Cleveland.  The beef brisket sandwich was also surprisingly large and looked equally delicious.  I couldn't help but be a little disappointed at the lack of any french fries.  The home fries were okay but just didn't hit the spot the same way."}
{"text":"Ok, where should I start..... First let me say I love the fact that they had a fire going on the coldest day yet.12/15/2016.  The decor was beautiful! The food was quit another story.  First I wanted to sit in front of the fire, that was obviously a problem for the bartender.  We settled on the 3rd table in the discussion.   It's not like they were busy only one other table taken. The table I wanted was reserved.  My associate ordered a well done hamburger with mushrooms.  The meat was only cool, the bun tasted stale.  I had a salad with chicken, the chicken was barley warm.  The people next to us had steaming hot food served and hot bread.  We were not even asked if we wanted bread.  I asked the waitress for bread and butter it came to us half stale and cold.  The split pea soup was wonderful though.  This place is by know means cheap, my bill for salad with chicken and a cup of soup was $34.00 with a 20% tip.  Personally, I think the bartender had a bit of an attitude. I know, I for one, will never go back."}
{"text":"The good: Good taste, front area indoors is nice, great patio, the Guinness chocolate ball a must! The bad: The menu is a single page of basically steaks and burgers (no sides included), all around 10-15 bux. Beer was pricy. Service was average.  The ugly: worth checking out at least once(don't confuse it with the rundown Red Stone bar down the street, yuck)"}
{"text":"Meh. I'm not sure what hype is with this place, but that may be because I came for dinner on a cold night, and not for drinks on the patio in the summer.  For that, I'll be back some time. For dinner, I won't.   For starters, the service was pretty terrible.  We stood at the hostess stand for 10 minutes before even being acknowledged, and even then were barely communicated with. We were told there was a wait and the waitress then disappeared. Instead of continuing to stand uncomfortably in the doorway we went up to the front room bar to have a drink while waiting (something the hostess/waitress should have offered) and eventually were seated for dinner. Unfortunately the food didn't make up for the lackluster start. I had the beef brisket sandwich which was only good enough to be edible. They need to at least invest in some real breads/rolls for their sandwiches, not a cold and limp grocery store version which is what this one seemed to be.  Maybe this was an off night so I may give them a try again, at least just for drinks when the weather warms up. In the meantime, I'll remain confused as to the glowing reviews I'm reading from my fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"Got to say this place is wonderful. Inside or outside you can't go wrong. Large party room, upstairs private party and they even have Bocci ball too. The drinks were excellent they had a little twist of an original Bloody Mary with beef broth. Had a full brunch meal and all super. The service was great too. The prices won't kill you... Make this a stop and you'll won't regret..."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars, not because it is necessarily the best bar or restaurant in Cleveland (specifically the Detroit Shoreway), but because they are very good at what they decided to be: a pub.    The place is beautiful, the service was friendly and welcoming from the moment we stepped in the door, and the happy hour is unbeatable.  $3 drinks.  $5 apps.  I had Tangueray gimlets and the mussels.  The mussels were small, but the sauce was great and so was the bread for dipping, so for $5 who cares how small the little guys are?  I was delighted with the broth.  They do good business here, and it is no wonder.  They CARE about their business: what they do, how they do it, their neighborhood, and how they treat their customers."}
{"text":"The food is unique but still familiar, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, the building is beautiful, the patio is fantastic, the staff are competent and they pour the Guinness properly and with pride!"}
{"text":"After an earlier disappointing experience we went back because we live nearby and wanted to go somewhere with a patio to enjoy the nice weather.  We were greeted immediately and seated at one of the high tops since we were not interested in dinner. To our surprise the review I left earlier did not go unnoticed and it was taken seriously. We were offered a drink on the house and also an apology about being understaffed the other day.  Kudos to being sincerely interested in your guests opinion and making them feel like every single one counts.   We had a great time that night and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried Stone Mad. I will definitely be back. The atmosphere is quite, warm and intimate. The dress is casual. The food is fabulous. I had the brisket. Tender, moist, and flavorful. My wife had the shepherd's pie. They use actual shredded lamb in their pie. A great assortment of beer and wine. The staff is very friendly and helpful. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We first spotted Stone Mad Pub while trying to find parking to go to Sweet Moses. The building sits far enough down the street on 65th that I thought we were completely into the residential area. But then we spotted the stone chimney of the patio fireplace and had to circle the block to make sure we'd seen this magical place.  Tonight we finally went to the Pub. It was definitely not a sit-on-the-patio day, being so cold, but the fireplace was providing warmth for the smokers. Still, we wandered longingly about on the patio. We will definitely be hanging out there come spring.  Inside, the pub area is warm and inviting, with a fireplace and cozy tables. We chose to eat in the pub area, rather than in the dining room. (They have a bocce ball court in the dining room! How cool is that?) The service was quick and friendly, and the food was quite good. Ferrett and I each had the prime rib special, and our friend Bec had the Caesar salad with flank steak. The meat was all tasty and tender, the French beans that accompanied my prime rib were cooked to perfection, and the dressing on the salad was light and flavorful. My only ding on the meal was that the plates had not been warmed, so my prime rib was a little cool and the au jus on the plate got cold quite quickly. Otherwise, it was delicious and a very nice evening."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place, as I've had totally different experiences the times I've been there.  I was loving this place after having been on St. Paddy's day. I had an amazing corned beef sandwich that came out FAST considering how packed the place was. They had the fireplace on the patio going and it made the outside area considerably warmer. I wanted to go back.  I went back for a friend's birthday and we were charged to bring in cupcakes that were a gift for our friend. Ok...not totally startling and I was prepared to pay the fee. We had excellent meals and great drinks. However, we were practically kicked out toward 11pm. The waitresses kept giving us dirty looks and gave us our bills before we asked. Perhaps we were only one of 2 other tables in the dining area, but couldn't they have suggested we move up to the bar area? The pushy staff made my experience bad.  I went again and this time, the patio was almost empty. Yet, they didn't let us choose any table on the open patio because one member of our party was on their way and not there yet. So, we went in to the bar to grab drinks. I must say, their happy hour specials are fantastic and the pizza is delicious. After the other member of our party arrived, we went back out to the patio. We were quoted a 40 minute wait for the now crowded patio. We went back inside for drinks at the bar. After one hour, we were finally seated. The service was incredibly slow and the waiter failed to bring the bill after my friend asked 2 times.   Overall, the glowing experience I had here was the food and drinks. An unfriendly staff is the downfall here and can totally break an experience."}
{"text":"Very strange indeed.   The girl and I are wandering around the neighborhood off of Detroit...nice day...walking down some old side streets in the shore-way area.   Italian flags spray painted everywhere, little shops, some closed, old Italian businesses, light industry, some tired old homes, kids playing in the street with the lake in view..   Then we saw it...what the hell!!! Stone Mad Pub... a fortress in the middle of nowhere. This was a bizarre experience to say the least.   We arrive at this crazy place surrounded by a thick hand-layed wall..with an iron gate and Celtic style writing in the middle of italian-land. Over the wall are numerous stone table and chairs, a stone 2 story fire pit, and mosaic tiles... cobblestone parking lot   So we go inside to this fabulous walnut bar that has been rubbed with boiled linseed oil... hand blown glass fixtures ,walnut wainscoting- rich rich rich!! . Further in is the middle bar, with small intimate tables, art on the walls, more blown glass.. and then the last room...fashioned as an old trattoria, hand painted ceiling, with checked table clothes and a full indoor boccie court!!.......huh?   We order the signature Guinness...poured from a special station in a ritualistic way.  Impressive!!!.... $6.50 each...Shitty!   We move outside, order a cheaper beer for Gods sake, and split a sammy...pulled pork.   Dry, like scrape-the-plate dry. Big. No sauce, drippings, mayo...just BAD.   A richly dressed waiter tells stories- 3 years to build, 40,000 pavers ..millions of dollars.   Seated next to us is a family with crying children...the hamburger looks awesome.... too bad, and the kid couldn't finish it anyway ( should have snatched it off his plate)   Anyway ... Romantic for us to be there!...  Until -   Bill time:  $38.00 for 1 sammy 4 beers... and a tip.   The older crowd starts to arrive on this late Saturday afternoon...we escape this very odd, schizophrenic high priced white elephant.   No Sir...I will not pay for your construction bill...let the others do that.   Out."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Cleveland, and our friends decided to bring us here to enjoy a beautiful afternoon. The patio was perfectly shaded, and our drinks were great. I tried several cocktails and enjoyed them all, and my friends both tried and were happy with several beers. The staff was friendly and  personable. I couldn't have picked a better place to enjoy the weather with good friends!"}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor eating. We ate the rib-eye and baked Brie. Would definitely recommend for a Friday night meal!"}
{"text":"Unique ambiance of an authentic Irish Pub. Efficient and friendly staff, helpful with suggestions. Excellent drinks, delectable food. The place has a magic of its own. Beautiful interior, the love and hard work put in to this place is exceptional. The Stone courtyard is a masterpiece. Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, good service and the absolutely best rib eye steak I have ever had!"}
{"text":"PLUS:  Very good Guinness. Cool bartender Clean and well kempt Indoor bocce court  MINUS:   No music and/or tv"}
{"text":"I've been struggling for a while to find inspiration to review Stone Mad. It's not that I don't like Stone Mad, because I do, it's just that I am having trouble mustering up any inspirational anecdotes or parables to help describe my time here. Perhaps, at least to me, Stone Mad just doesn't offer much else beyond it's stone face value.   First of all, I will echo others in praising the intricate masonry & glass work. As a person in the construction business, I can appreciate all of the hard work and vision it must've took to create. This Irish stone fortress is really something to be marveled. I am confident there is nothing else like it in the world. The millions invested to recreate this space seems like money well spent.   My favorite thing about Stone Mad is the patio. It's secluded behind, you guessed it, layers, upon layers of stone. A man made waterfall and wood burning fireplace add to the ambiance. The benches, also made of stone are about as unconformable as an old Catholic church pew. I suppose wicker rocking chairs with comfy cushions would look out of place here and would jive with the whole stone theme though.  Overall, Stone Mad seems more of a novelty than a place I'd frequent on a regular basis. While this space certainly promotes good conversation in a classy environment, it seems more fitting for groups than a date spot or a solo venture."}
{"text":"Sucker for outdoor patios, and I love the convenient but semi secluded location.  Food is definitely above average bar food to,  check it out!"}
{"text":"I happened on this pub courtesy of a vendor who was taking me and a coworker to lunch. I had no idea what to expect when we pulled up the cobblestone drive and iron fence.  First off, let me tell you: this is no place for stilettos. My party was practically seated as I carefully maneuvered my way across the cobblestone and brick drive, trying not to break an ankle or a heel. Yes, I take full responsibility for my choice of sky high footwear but I also don't encounter walkways reminiscent of old England that frequently, either.   The restaurant itself is interesting. The front of the house is all shiny dark woods, stained glass, and a cozy fireplace. One would expect peet on the fire with a ratty irish sheepdog sleeping near by. The back of the house is bright and airy; light woods, lots of windows and a bocce ball court.   Wait - a bocce ball court? I thought bocce ball was Italian? And I thought this was supposed to be an Irish pub? I'm still confused on that one.  The menu is pretty small; small enough to be entirely written on blackboard on one end of the wall. I felt bad for my vegetarian companion who had basically one option: salad. I ordered the turkey club, it came with a side of cole slaw. No fries here unless you order them on the side. The turkey was very fresh and very real; no compacted deli meat here. It was delicious although very salty. The cheese and bacon added to the salty factor; I think had it not had that overwhelming saltiness it would've been quite outstanding. I don't like cole slaw but my companions said it was good.  I wouldn't waste your time with the home fries. The thinly sliced potatoes had no crunch and no seasoning. I saw them from a distance on someone else's plate and thought (hoped)they were more like homemade potato chips. You can imagine the disappointment when I spooned some of the limp slices on my plate.   Overall, I'd give it another chance. Probably when not with a vegetarian friend and won't feel guilty about ordering the brisket sandwich. Also, when the weather warms up and the outside patio open and I can sneak in a nice pint!"}
{"text":"Great patio and drinks! Small menu and portions but good so plates are clean when you leave"}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews on the food, and being that I've never eaten anything here I can't comment on the chow. However, I can comment on the bar! I bartend and often work til very late. When I get off work around 12 or 1, I love to hop in my car and drive to Stone Mad for a drink and a good time! The bartenders are top-notch and make me feel at home!  What I love is that  they don't treat me like I'm holding them up because they want to get out of there already! They're open til 2, no matter what.  I have to give a big shout out to Giuseppe and Steve, my two favorite bartenders! So stop in on and let your experience speak for itself!"}
{"text":"Another boring Irish gastro-pub, hint, hint there are plenty of them around the Westpark and Lakewood areas.  This one near Ohio City - Gordon Square, filled with school teachers, hipsters and very few locals.  The patio decor is bizarre and the food and service are pretentious prices for what you get.  We have had better, although it is not one, it has a distinctly chainy-franchise feel to it."}
{"text":"Hit up this place late Saturday night for drinks -- what a great hidden gem in this neighborhood. It's within walking distance of the also-fabulous Capitol Theater, so you can totally get sloshed here after you see some indie film your girlfriend wanted to see but which actually put you to sleep.  Anyhoo...the outside decor of this place is stunning, although we could only take it in for about 10 minutes before a hellacious thunderstorm. I'm glad to say that the inside is also cool and a bit more my style. We sat near the bar, which is one of those 1950s-style bars (complete with bartenders with black ties) that will make you feel self-conscious about showing up in cargo pants. (Look, I'm a schlub, I'M SORRY.)   The ambiance was great, the food that other people ordered smelled great, and the waitress didn't even give us shit for staying and kiboshing well after we were finished with our drinks. Solid place (literally)."}
{"text":"The service was great and we had 12 people in our party. Our meals were all served together, hot and done to perfection. Our server was friendly and made our experience worth repeating!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed by the lack of any food being served at Edgewater for the 4th of July, we started trekking around the area looking for whatever was in walking distance. I'll be honest, Stone Mad wasn't our first (or second, or third, or even fourth) choice based on the reviews. I'm really glad it wound up being the only viable option because it was phenomenal!   The patio space is excellent and worth coming for alone to grab a couple of drinks. We had a small feast and ordered several things off the menu to split -- crab cakes, sliders, pizza, and a burger, along with four beers. The crab cakes were easily my favorite. Everything else was really good, although I wasn't crazy about the pizza. My less picky husband was very happy with it, though. I was pleasantly surprised when our bill only rang out to $75.   If I'm being perfectly honest, I wouldn't be giving 4-stars without the great patio atmosphere. I'd probably skip this place in the colder months, but it's well worth a visit during patio season."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the  first time we decided to try appetizers and a pizza  Appetizers Seared pork belly.   A+  Brisket tacos C  the brisket was dry and tasteless  Brussels sprouts. A+  CRAB cakes  F real fishy taste and smell we did not finish them   And last by not least the pizza was the mushroom spininch and it was the best pizza we have had I'm awhile.    We will try it again"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for the RNC and decided to find a good place for lunch outside of the main convention area.  My friend brought me to Stone Mad Pub and I had a fantastic meal!  We sat on the outside patio which was made completely of stone.   I had one of the best burgers of my life - the Black and Blue Burger along with a Black & Tan.  Our server was Nina who was absolutely charming and offered exceptional service.   A great dining experience overall - Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight. The soup came out cold but tasted good.  Unfortunately our hamburgers were ordered medium rare and came out rare cold in the middle. We sent them back thinking they would cook a new burger but no after peeling off the cheese bacon etc they mushed...the burger back together   Now the burger is well done. Horrible experience. The waitress was adorable the food poor."}
{"text":"I come for the bocce & great happy hour specials. The front bar often has live music, the patio is awesome, and the back room has the bocce! Beautiful bar tucked back in a increasingly popular neighborhood.   Major League Bocce Cleveland sponsors seasonal bocce leagues here and the bar runs their own tournaments throughout the year."}
{"text":"Never really hung out around the Detroit Shoreway but this bar is changing my mind. Went for happy hour on a Thursday-relatively crowded but not annoyingly packed.  List of appetizers including mussels, pizza, and quesadillas for $5!  Some of the best mussels I've had.  Pizza was delicious too.  Quesadilla was good, but I'm not a huge lover of them initially.  I believe there were wings and a few other things on the menu as well.  They had a list of cocktails and wine between $3-5 dollars for happy hour as well.  I will definitely be back.  I heard the stone in the bathroom is beautiful and theres a bocce court that I want to check out."}
{"text":"This hidden jewel was a great find. Went there as a part of a group. Although no one greeted us at the door or even asked us where we were going, we found are way and the staff handling our group greeted us and was very personal. Omg can I say the Brisket sandwich was AWESOME!!! It is now one of my favorite dishes. I was a little upset that the gratuity charge was not explained up front and was added to my bill after I received the check. But over all I really enjoyed my visit and will be back for another Brisket Sandwich soon."}
{"text":"I have come here several times for dinners and social parties and have never had any issues, but \"the first day of nice spring weather,\" the owner herself doesn't know how to properly treat her customers. 5:30 and the patio isn't packed. We are here for a birthday party where people will be trickling in and we get accused of \"holding a table\" when we have five people - three at a four person table and two people at another four person table. Where are we supposed to sit and eat if there isn't a 5-6 people table open?  She continued to argue with us that we needed to move to the \"cocktail\" standing area (and we had to move for about 2 minutes). How am I supposed to eat my pizza in a standing cocktail area (it's possible, but that's my dinner!)? She finally gave up because she said I didn't appear happy and didn't want to argue with me. Not only was she arguing with a customer, trying to move us to the cocktail areas, but she points out my attitude?! Ugh - not coming again. I'm in marketing, I deal with clients every day. Treat customers like they are always right and if there are underlying circumstances, at least be professional. There were positives for the night - great friends, decent food / drinks and an awesome server (shout out to Nichole!), but if the owner of the establishment doesn't have the same appreciation and respect as her employees than hopefully she was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"A really lovely neighbourhood pub. I had a blueberry lemonade martini.... so good! Cool atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Our first visit -Great service / Great food - Katelyn is one of the best waitresses ever and The Beef Brisket was excellant as advertised - Very cool patio"}
{"text":"Wonderful outside seating area.  Wonderful service.  Our waiter was very attentive and just the right level of friendlyness."}
{"text":"First of all drink prices are a little steep (3 stars) but don't let that keep you away from this gem of a place!   The stone patio is unlike anything I've seen and is the super relaxing atmosphere you'd want for a cozy summer night. The clientele is mid-age and older but I didn't feel out of place here. The bar when you first walk inside is large and inviting, reminding me of the bar from cheers. Keep going back and you'll end up at the indoor bocce court and open kitchen. This unique bar is worth your stop!  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"We ate on the patio on a warm evening....the service was very slow and the food was ok   We had a margarita pizza.  We asked for some plates that took three requests to be delivered....by the time they came the pizza was cold and stiff.    We had the brussel sprouts that we fine.   We also had the roasted chicken drumstix appetizer that were pretty good.   Not much meat, but something I hadn't seen before.  Atmosphere was kind of cool with a lot of stone tables, benches and seats.   Maybe the inside is a better dining experience but imust be a long walk from the patio to the bar/kitchen because drinks and food took a long time to show up.   I guess it is just a pub where you shouldn't expect to have much of a dining experience.  They have Bocce which I guess is a draw...."}
{"text":"WOW! I am not sure where to start with this place... We tripped upon this place quite by accident - which unless you have previously heard of the place and are heading there as a destination - is really the only way you'll find it. We had stopped in at Gypsy Bean for a coffee and since it was such a beautiful sunny/crisp afternoon, we decided to go for a walk. To say we were surprised to find this beautifully crafted pub in the middle of nowhere would be an understatement. We weren't really sure what we had come across, but decided to go in and have a beer (or two...) Having read Mike M's review (nice job, honey!), I won't go into another description of the beautiful decor - inside and outside - or the fact that you can play bocce ball inside the restaurant while you wait for your table (how fun is that?!) I will say that I love this place. I'd give it 5 stars if the beer was a little less expensive and the food had been just a little bit better prepared - although it may have just been our selection. Our service was impeccable - both at the bar and on the outside patio. The dinner menu looked reasonably priced and well rounded. I'd like to go back for dinner... SO -  I love this place. I'd like to have a reason to host a party there. I will take my Seattle friends there when they come to town for a visit.  I say try it - you'll like it. Just be prepared to pay a little bit more for what you get."}
{"text":"I have been to Stone Mad a few times now.. I must say this last time I was a bit disappointed.   First - not very child friendly. No kids cups, no kids menu, no crayons... no nothing for kids.. the waitress was so nice to make us some butter noodles for free.. that was very nice!!!   Second- I remember their burgers being so yummy .. but last night it was a bit nauseating.. way to fat/thick and greasy.. Not to mention they got my order wrong .. i asked for no bun, onion, or tomato.. it came with all three ... the sautéed peppers and caramelized onions we so greasy and not tasty at all..   The home fries were pretty good! And everyone else in my family seemed to enjoy their meal...  Oh and the decor of the building is beautiful!!!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent first experience at Stone Mad. The staff an environment are welcoming! I located the restaurant easily and there was ample parking on the street out front or in their lot. Very conveniently close to the Capitol movie theater.. great place to eat before catching a movie. That's exactly what my friend and I did.   The staff was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu as well as the numerous specials.. and the service was JUST RIGHT. They were there with everything we wanted without being overly attentive either. That is how service should be!! We sat in the middle bar area and it was very cozy!  The was a few moments of confusion about our reservation when we arrived but that was no big deal.   I had the pork chop and it was superb, as were the steamed veggies I subbed in. My friend had the fish fry and liked it but said it wasn't mind blowing. Our shared app of mussels were divine!  Also the pickles you start out with are excellent and made in house. The kosher and dill are both SO good I got some to go!  Can't believe it took me this long to try this place, I will be back soon. ALso looking forward to enjoying their patio... VERY cool looking....all stone and fireplaces too!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"This is a short and sweet review: I have to agree with the other patrons--the food is absolutely delicious, but it is a bit overpriced. I think they have an amazing happy hour though and I will gladly take advantage of it on any given day."}
{"text":"We stopped in a couple of times since we moved in the neighborhood a month ago and brought some friends and neighbors.  We spent well and tipped well and liked the place.  My wife and I stopped in today and decided to sit on the patio.  With an empty bar/restaurant and a mostly empty patio we were relegated to an L shaped seat in the corner.  I asked for one of the empty booths so we were at least facing each other and was told that there were only two of us so we couldn't have a booth.  Never mind that of the other two occupied tables one was a party of two.  We left, won't be back, and will steer others away.  Shoddy way to treat customers"}
{"text":"I would have to say that Stone Mad is a pretty okay place.  The patio is absolutely beautiful.  It has been totally build out of stone.  There is a fountain at one end and an outdoor fireplace at the other.  I loved sitting out here having a beer.  However, the rest of the experience didn't floor me.  The beer selection was actually pretty good, and they serve their drinks in what can only be described as a \"beer chalice.\"  It was a fun drinking experience.  Prices were pretty good during cocktail hour and not bad after.  Be careful if you order a Guinness, it is more expensive than all the other beers.  The service was my big issue with the Stone Mad Pub.  We sat at our table for about three hours and saw a server about 3 times.  It took quite a while for someone to come over and take our order.  The food was also not worth the price I paid for it.  I ordered buffalo chicken tenders, and I got about $3 worth of food for the $8 that I paid.  If you're looking for good bang for your buck, get the Stone Mad Burger.  It's 12 oz. for $9.  It looked pretty good too.  Not great, but good.  I would go back to Stone Mad again, but I would stick to only beverages next time."}
{"text":"I can not say enough great things about this restaurant!! Everything from the drinks, to the food, to the wait staff is extraordinary! Not to mention that they have the best patio in Cleveland. :)"}
{"text":"Just beautiful.    Summer or any other sunny days are obviously the best time to wander about the Stone Mad Patio.  It's a great atmosphere with tables and benches and also high tables better for mingling.  The restaurant is nice, as it's broken up into a few different dining areas as well as a rather large bar area when you first enter.   I took my mom here as she really appreciates patios and anything outdoor, however it was very cold and very rainy on the day that we had planned.  It wasn't the same sitting at a table inside and not really enjoying anything outdoors aside from looking out the window.  SO, what do I do?  Give her a tour of the bathroom.  Well, actually, the door man walked us downstairs, into the women's room, and talked with us for a good 20 minutes about the tile in there as well as all the renovations that were made.  As well as his childhood.  It was uncomfortably hysterical.  Probably the best part of the dining experience.  When you go, make sure to inquire, or at least appreciate all of the fine details from the sinks in the bathroom to the doorknobs.  They put a lot of thought into the beauty of this place; and they're so not even done yet."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best patios in Cleveland, absolutely love it! I went there for a weekday lunch. The food was great and the summer drink specials were very yummy! I had the turkey sandwich and the raspberry lemonade complete with booze! Yum!"}
{"text":"What a gem !  Met a friend from long ago here and was truly amazed at how great it was.  So nice to be at a real local hangout.  Food was amazing. The patio was rustic and inviting.  Service was quick, polite and very gracious.  If I lived in the area this would be my to go to place!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time and was not disappointed!  I had the Shepards Pie which was fantastic, my husband had crab cakes and shrimp gumbo.  We were both very happy with the meal and atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back in the summer!"}
{"text":"Stone Mad has a lot of things going for it, and over the last few months I ended up there one way or another several times.  The interior really nails the look and feel of an authentic pub, and the outdoor Flintstone-cum-Stonehenge patio is the greatest of all henges (at least in Cleveland).  If you go, make sure to visit the beautiful, but oddly psychedelic bathrooms downstairs.  The bocce ball court in the back is a neat touch too.    They seem to have a good selection of beers (I don't drink so...) and the menu though limited, has been pretty good in my experience.  The burgers and salads are large, and the baked brie and strawberries are a nice appetizer.  The reason my review isn't better is mostly due to two things.  No soda on tap, so $2 get's you a mixer sized can of pop, and no refills.  For a non-drinker like me, this is a drag, plain and simple.  The other thing I have found is that the service can be hit or miss, and in one case downright rude to my family.  I wasn't present for this incident, but have no reason to disbelieve them.  I have been back a couple of times since then and the service has been passable to great.    Regardless, it's a place with a lot of charm, and it appeals to old and young alike.  I would not hesitate to return, especially if someone was in from out of town and wanted to see some of what makes Cleveland great."}
{"text":"Patio is different. Although all the stone and cement furniture outside look real nice, your ass will be numb if sitting for more than 30 minutes.  Food is real good but a little pricy.  I like the wood interior, a nice old school touch.  Bocce court is a joke if you've ever played the game."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome place! Very friendly owner who has hired a great staff. The restaurant has such character, gorgeous woodwork inside and a really cool stone patio. The food was very good. We came for brunch, I ordered an Irish dish a little out of my comfort zone and was not disappointed. Everything was so tasty and cooked to perfection! We will definitely return to try more!"}
{"text":"As a east side of Cleveland native I never really venture to the \"West side\" but on a recent trip home a friend invited me to Stone Mad and I was impressed. We sat outside on the patio where all of the furniture was made of concrete which would seem uncomfortable but was surprisingly not. Since I only went for drinks I cant comment on the food, though those in the group that ate seemed to enjoy it.   The atmosphere was nice, as there was low music, a water feature and colored lighting.. One of the owners (or a really drunk man) stopped by to talk about how the lights in the water could change colors and that the porch of the neighboring house would soon become a stage for local bands.   Drinks were decently strong and refreshing. This place deserves a return visit the next time I make a trip back home."}
{"text":"I would not recommend going here especially if you are planning to do happy hour. My friend and I arrived a little after 4pm and wanted to sit outside on the patio since it was a nice day. We asked the bartender if we could go outside and drink and we were informed that it was fine. Once we went to the patio to be seated we were asked if we were going to eat or not. I informed the waitress that we planned to have a drink and appetizer. The waitress than informed us that it was fine for us to sit outside since we were having an appetizer, but if we had not we would have had to go to the bar. According to the waitress it was going to be a busy night and due to that anyone drinking and not eating would have to drink inside. I would like to point out that when we arrived, only 2 other tables at the patio had anyone sitting at them and there were tons of tables open. (Even by the time we left the patio was still only half full.)  Once we sat down my friend and I began to examine the menu. A few minutes later the waitress came back and told us that if we wanted any of the happy hour specials we would have to go to the bar. Due to this my friend and I moved inside to the bar.  At the bar my friend and I order a drink and I order the chicken fingers appetizer as a light snack. The drinks were okay and what I expected from a pub. However, when my appetizer arrived I was severely disappointed. The chicken tenders were suppose to be lightly bread. But, it looked like they were not breaded at all. Additionally, the chicken was dry and was placed on top of lettuce/cabbage mix, which was not mentioned in the description of the food. Due to this I ended up picking at my food. Shortly after my friend and I left.   Overall, I would suggest not going here for happy hour."}
{"text":"Coming from Mentor on a recommendation, turned out to be super. Only draw back, stone high tops feet dangle! Highly recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland this weekend for a wedding with my boyfriend and whenever we go to Cleveland we visit this place. My boyfriend use to live in Cleveland and is a friend of the owner. We went there sunday afternoon and had drinks and food on the patio. The service was not the best but it was very relaxing and peaceful time. We will continue to go there when we are in town!"}
{"text":"To begin with I don't really mind paying 6.50 for a well poured Guiness and the gent behind the bar pours the best pint I have had since I was in Dublin.  According to the bartenders in Ireland the foam should be just as wide as a bishops collar and the pour here is spot on.  5 stars for the beer.  I have not tried the food so I can't comment on that.  Why did I take two stars away?  Apparently the owner enjoys his Guiness.....a lot.....at the bar.....drunk.  No no no no no.  It ruined the evening.  Loud, obnoxious, and drunk.  I will be back, but I won't step in the door if he is there again."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place as they have a nice patio and it was nearly empty.  We had our dog with us - she's a well-behaved, small Lab mix.  We asked if she was welcome on the patio, and we were told absolutely not.  Probably won't go back.  Many other patios in the Cleveland area do allow dogs."}
{"text":"We had been driving around looking for a place to eat and didn't realize this pub has food..we had eaten across the street and kept seeing people going back and forth and a lot of traffic.. so after our pizza..we decided to Check out this place and after looking at the menu we will be back! So we had a beer and they have extensive selection. Service was quick and friendly.  We loved the patio with fireplace and cannot wait to be back."}
{"text":"We strolled by stone mad and stopped for brunch. They do not have a large brunch menu at all and I think the bartender was hungover and ignoring us as we stood there to be seated. Anyways moving outside to the large patio that we soaked up the sun and a mimosa. The food was ok but because the brunch menu was so small we opted for the Brie and Jam app which was really good. The patio is awesome with a large stone fireplace and the seats are rocks and look built into the patio as a part of the setting, pretty unique. They also have indoor bocce ball courts which is the main reason I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Won't go back. The patio, decor, and beer list are the true stars at this place. Everything else was so subpar. We went on the 4th of July and although there were only a few items on their \"special\" menu for the holiday (read: all but one of the items on this menu is available on the regular menu, not sure what made it \"special\"), it took us almost two hours to get 4 pints and two entrees. There were an army of servers standing around on the patio, but only our server would help us, every 1/2 or so. There were so many employees, doing nothing but talking and gossiping with each other. We ordered grilled chicken buffalo tenders and a grilled brat, both were totally underwhelming. I had potato salad as a side, but it came in a giant mound that covered half the plate and was so cloyingly sweet, I honestly couldn't eat it.      We had high hopes for this place based on the sort of cool space and the giant beer list, but it was so disappointing, I would never go again and would tell anyone else I know thinking about it not to bother. I'm a great home cook and I really believe restaurant food should be significantly better than anything I can whip up at home, or at least be something that I can't make myself. We totally regretted our meal here."}
