{"text":"5 stars to Americana and their brunch. If you are looking for a great bottomless special and awesome service then come see Natalie at Americana!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this restaurant for lunch with my wife and we had the sliders and the southwestern burger.  All of the food was fantastic!  Burger cooked just right, and with the brioche bun - PERFECT.  The fries were delicious.  Even the coffee was better than expected for a \"pub\" type of fare.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Americana is cool. It's not exactly the most impressive thing I've seen, but it gets the job done. Kinda like that girl who will do stuff with you that you don't want to tell your parents about. Natalie gets it, when it comes to bottomless mimosas-- but she doesn't let you push the envelope. What an above average experience this has been."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I was pleasantly surprised because the restaurant that was in this location before didn't do very well. I've been here about 3 times already and every time got something new and it's been awesome. They have great burgers and the loaded tots were so amazing! The service was really good even when they were getting a little busier. The place was newly redesigned to fit the brand of the Americana theme and it's really cool. It's very well priced and they have some good happy hour deals. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food , great service . Our server's name I believe was Hailey and she was great. She made me and my friends feel welcomed and at home! Definitely my new place on mill"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Best eggs Benedict I have ever had. Our server was Sarah and she did a great job. The manager Matt was also great. When I'm back in town I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"went for brunch, could have stayed for dinner! excellent service (thank you brooke) and awesome food! we'll be back... with more family and look to make more friends here!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I got this salad, you can tell it was made with love. The atmosphere is frickin cool, they got drums hanging from the ceiling.  I've never seen any ting like that before. Americana is great for pre gaming, post gaming, day drinking, night drinking, taking a date to or even dumping someone at. I look forward to going back. If you want to try one of the best restaurants in Arizona go here. If you are lucky enough to get Cally as a server you'll have quite a spectacular time... I mean I'm sure the other staff is great but Cally for Pres."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick happy hour drink and some appetizers! Americana is relatively new on Mill and has a very nice interior and outdoor patio! 

The food and drinks, while a good deal on happy hour, are average at best. Drinks were watered down and wings were average. 

The service on the other hand was great!! Paige is the best! 

They also have $15 bottomless mimosas on Sundays or if you're really adventurous they have a huge fishbowl drink that 5+ people could probably share! 

I wish them the best as they get their start on Mill!"}
{"text":"You have to try this place out and ask to be seated in Mercedes section! She is AMAZING! I assure you she will take care of you! The vibe was pretty cool except the 90's rock that was playing!  ... honestly it was great! I highly recommend this place. Food was great service was amazing and the vibe was very casual!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to rate this place higher. The food we had to eat there was awesome! The staff was really friendly. Our waiter was new, but good & the manager came to see if everything was going well. I had the French dip, my wife ordered the Benedict Burger, my son got the macaroni and cheese burger, and we shared the tater tots appetizer. All really really good. My wife ended up taking her burger to go & when she went to eat it, the meat was nearly raw ground beef. Pretty gross. She couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"We strolled down Mill Avenue to grab a bite and a drink before heading to ASU for the basketball game. We found an open table at Americana on the patio where we soaked in the perfect temperature and fresh air.
I had a sweet beer and my husband had a margarita.  I appreciated getting to sample the beer before I ordered a nice large mug.
We ordered the traditional macaroni and cheese to share.  It was the perfect comfort food and was the right size to share as an appetizer.
We had to chase down our server for water and later to close out our tab.  
The waitresses and greeters were friendly, however, they were texting throughout our time there. Once while we were actually talking to her.  
I would not recommend this location for family dinners due to the overtly sensual clothing of the women.
There are many restaurants along Mill Avenue and we will not go back to Americana next time."}
{"text":"What a great place! Good service. Quality food and beer. And what a great patio and bar. I'll be back to enjoy more items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Great vibe and even better food. Our server Hailey was so upbeat! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"First, great location. We sat outside in February and it was hot. Given that there was a snow storm back home we were not complaining. Very large menu. Good kids menu. Inside looked more like your typical college bar.  They have Tator Tots!  Even Sweet Potato Tator Tots!  Sorry..."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since it was new and offered brunch.  The food and service were definitely good. 

Checking in provided a free appetizer. I went with the wings. The wings were crispy and flavorful. A great start to the meal. 

Wanted to order the shrimp and grits but they no longer carry them :(. Went with the meat lovers scramble. They have plenty of meats in the scramble so you'll be happy. Comes with amazing potatoes. I think the potatoes are the star dish. 

Also opted for the Bellini flight. They had some great flavors. My favorite was the kiwi apple. The staff was friendly and helpful. If you are looking for unlimited mimosas they offer them for $15."}
{"text":"Food: Awesome Burgers/Sandwiches 
Atmosphere: Super Cool Bar & Dining Area 
Wait Staff: Could Be More Attentive/Long Wait for Check

I stopped in today for lunch with my boyfriend. We were greeted at the door upon walking in and were sat at a high top near the back of the restaurant. The lights and overall style of the place is super cute! Our server greeted us promptly and we told her we would need a few minutes before ordering. Everything looked so good! I ended up ordering the Big Kahuna burger with sweet potato tots and my boyfriend ordered the Pesto Club with a side salad. The Big Kahuna burger tasted amazing. It was thick, juicy but not overly greasy. The sweet potato tots were alright. They really tasted like brown sugar, which I personally  don't care for when it comes to sweet potato fries/tots. My boyfriend finished his Pesto Club before I could get a bite, but he said it was also delicious. Our server came out and ask how everything was just once throughout the meal. Since we checked in on Yelp we got a free dessert and chose the cheesecake. We waited about ten minutes after ordering it before it finally came out. I would've rather opted for the appetizer instead as the cheesecake was super hard and chunky. 

It was not busy when we tried getting the check. We had to ask another server to find our waiter and then waited about ten minutes before the check was brought to us. I feel like it might have been because she needed a manager to adjust our bill for the free dessert, however, I had showed our waitress the check in offer right after we ordered so that she'd have time adjust the bill before we asked. Oh well. 

Overall, we had a great time here with great food. I really hope Americana stays open through AZ's slow summer season. Their food and drinks are delicious. I can't wait to return on the weekend or for dinner to see what it's like at that time. The wait staff just needs to be a little more attentive."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT time today at our local Americana on Mill Ave in Tempe, AZ! So tired! Walked in and they were so friendly and so pleasant. Bloody Marys were perfect for brunch. We had a great time with our server Calloway. The manager needs to take our suggestion about shirts for their men. ;)"}
{"text":"This could've been a 5 star review because I mostly enjoyed my visit this time.

The downside was that it took about 5 minutes for a server to come to our table to greet us and an additional 13 minutes (I timed it) for our drinks to arrive. The bartender was just not working the service well at all... even the third round of drinks our server went behind the bar to pour the pitcher of beer. 

Nevertheless, the food was delicious. She was awesome with bringing me a ton of ranch!!! The quesadilla was bomb and the wings were definitely delicious, too! 

Hopefully next time we come it will be 5 stars. We will be back there again soon. 

Tips for management: make sure customer service is quick and attentive- I've noticed on Mill that restaurants severely lack quick and diligent service. Our server was awesome the whole time once she was informed that we were sat in her section- hence the wait for service at the beginning (she was training a young gal, too)."}
{"text":"The appetizer wings are bomb! In case you didn't know, they smoke their wings. They have a mesquite taste to it, but it does not overpower the wing sauce at all. Also, their burgers are cooked to perfection and they came out quick from the kitchen! Overall, they had fast service and good music playing. This is a fun place to hang out and watch a game/ fight!"}
{"text":"Two words: loaded tots.

Nuff said."}
{"text":"Lets start with seating really enjoyed sitting on the patio and people watching with our beer/bellini and mimosa flight. We got a beyond burger which was Vegan and it was wonderful and a waffle which was average and definitely hit the spot. We also got the hummus plate which was definitely tasty and help soak up some of the alcohol. This is definitely a brunch place for younger people but if you're feeling like you need a bit of a youth refresher it's not too crazy it's still good food"}
{"text":"Aside from the confusion with our servers in the beginning, this place is awesome! Great food and great drinks. We went in on a Sunday when they had a brunch menu and they were kind enough to give us the regular full menu. Will be back! The only thing I would suggest is half orders of the appetizers. The loaded tots and nachos were too big even for 2 people!"}
{"text":"A great new option on Mill Avenue that is steps from the ValleyRail station on Mill Ave.  Guests have inside or open-air options for dining/libating while watching a few sporting events on their ample number of flat screens. Great Daily and Happy Hours Specials worth looking into.  Our party went once for brunch and another time close to \"happy hour.\"  For brunch, we didn't want to order a large platter of breakfast, just something light from the Side Order section.  The avocado toast itself was thick, fresh and good!  The avocado that was spread on top was very thin  and had some slight dark discoloration on some of the toast, but some bacon saved the day! The other breakfast \"specials\" would probably have been a better option than ordering from the side dish menu?

Second time at Americana was at happy hour on Burger Monday.  $5.00 dollars for a fresh and large charbroiled burger!  (Also included is a domestic pint of draft for $1.00 more!) The burger was outstanding, fresh ground beef cooked and lightly seasoned perfectly on a pretzel bun.  The (burger set up) of fresh green leaf lettuce, thick and ripe tomato slices, purple onion, awesome pickles also includes any of thier sauce condiments that you wish to add.  Servers are outgoing, attentive (attractive) and hard-working!  Unless you crave something different, I don't see any real reason to go anywhere else?
THIS IS TRUE \"AMERICANA!\""}
{"text":"I work on Mill and I've been here 4 times since it opened. It has been anything but consistent. 

I get the same burger every time I go. Medium burger with cheddar and nothing else. It's pretty simple.

Visit #1
Cook doesn't seem to know what medium is. It was basically well done. The meat quality was great though.

Visit #2 
Burger was perfectly cooked. Pink in the middle, just as it should be. Meat quality was good.

Visit #3
Same experience as visit #2. Good work.

Visit #4
To start off, I ordered my burger and the waitress said, \"Are you sure? Our medium is pretty pink.\"

No. That's not how medium works... It's a temperature. Just because some idiot ordered a medium burger and then complained that it was pink doesn't mean you need to tell every customer that medium is pink. I know what medium is. Your medium shouldn't be different than any other restaurants medium if you are doing it right. 160º every time.

Im pretty sure the meat was a less quality prepackaged patty. Maybe it was frozen before but couldn't tell completely. It was a perfect hockey puck shape. The texture of the meat was not like the meat I had previously had here. Pretty awful compared to visit #2 and #3. 

Luckily there are a lot of other places on Mill that make burgers. Rehab Burger Therapy is very consistent. Five Guys is the exact same every time. The Chuckbox is amazing and always consistent. My co-workers and I will start going elsewhere for a while. We may give Americana another shot in a couple months if it still exists. The restaurant at this location seems to go out of business more frequently than others on Mill. They get rebadged and open up again with more mediocre food.

Ill update if I go back a couple times and things are different or more consistent.


Edit to reply to business owner's comment:  Again, that isn't how it works. It is pretty much set in stone. There is no opinion on medium or any other meat temperature. Doneness is a temperature, not a color. That is why we have \"meat thermometers\" and not \"meat color checkers\". The people that understand shouldn't have to deal with other people's ignorance. A possible solution would be to put a temperature chart on the menu. 

I've seen really good wing sauces taken off of menus(Venezia's) because people complained too often that the sauce that was labeled, \"Honey-Hot (It is really hot)\" was too hot. It's not really fair to people that aren't stupid. If you choose to cater to stupid people instead of educating them, this is what you get.

Of course you don't plan on going away...that wouldn't be a very solid business plan. I'm sure none of the others before you planned that either."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, huge TV screens, tasty food. We had the grilled chicken sandwich with fries and grilled cheese, tomato soup and tots. Our food was delicious! Even good lemonade & iced tea."}
{"text":"Walked into Americana and was throughly impressed with the decor. They have a super cool drum set that rotates on the ceiling and makes a cool vibe in the inside. Another cool thing is you can sit bar top on the patio or inside! Plus they have two bars, so drinks always come quickly! I highly recommend sitting at the bar with Savannah. She is such a sweetheart and will treat you like you're family and Americana is her home. Will be back for the good vibes and to see Savannah again!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and always looking for a new lunch spot with my co-workers.  The staff was super friendly and very attentive.  Came on a Monday and lucky they had lunch specials and Monday offered $5 for their burger, fries were 1.50 extra but nice to find deals for lunch in that are less than 10.00.  We all order something different and we were all very please with our food.  We got our food right away which is nice since we are there during our lunch hour.  The manager came to our table asked how our food was and apologize for the construction noise in the restaurant as they were building a stage.  We all really like the atmosphere they have a great lunch special and happy hour starts at 2pm.    

Note: Yelpers if you check in your get a free appetizer.  Also, Groupon offers 20% off your bill but you have the use a credit card that's associated with Groupon."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new in Tempe and found this place on yelp! It's right off of Mill which is the center of town; the perfect location! It was pretty dead so we had our choice of table which was awesome! There was a coupon when you check in for a free app or desert so we have the fried Mac n cheese balls and they were INCREDIBLE. The Mac had a side of jalapeño ranch which was amazing as well. The service was great and the food and beer was even better!!!!! We'll be keeping this on our list of fav places. Also the atmosphere was SUPER COOL. You have to go to know. So worth it. Would recommend to ANYONE."}
{"text":"We have been back 4 times since and it's been great everytime! The manager is great and always engages with us and has even sat down with us and gave great food suggestions. We live nearby and they make us feel like this is our neighborhood spot.we feel very at home here. They are busy but they take time for us."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger (not fast food) and chose this place to try something new. I knew I would be paying extra for this type of restaurant but it was the small experience that outweighed. I am disappointed with their happy hour. Nothing special on there to draw me in. I ordered a michelada $6HH and it wasn't that cold and the garnishes were an embarrassment. It satisfied my michelada fix. For food, I ordered $5HH mac cheese ball HH, and $13 decent Sante Fe burger - the guac was good. I got the salad on the side to cut the richness of the meal. Overall, I could have picked another place that I would have enjoyed a more foodie experience but the resturant was there and it was alright. I like trying new restarurants and overall it was good but not one I would make an effort to return to."}
{"text":"Still working out the kinks as it's a new business but the foundation is starting in the right direction to survive on Mill Ave.  Some fine tuning from management on the youthful staff will make a big difference.  Glad to see them hustling patrons on the street to bring people in and create a good environment and boost sales.   Food was good and they have plenty of food and drink specials for anyone's wallet.  Keep it up we'll be back again."}
{"text":"Food was good. Very long wait for someone to show up to seat us. Our waitress was terrible. Thank goodness there were others willing to help out."}
{"text":"Best burgers you'll ever eat! Service was amazing! Shout out Mercedes Benz, she was great!"}
{"text":"We came on a Wednesday around 2:45pm just to kill time before heading to the airport. There were about 4-5 employees and only about 4 other customers besides us two. Took about 10 minutes to receive service at the bar, the drink wasn't prepared as stated on the menu, then it was at least another 10 minutes to wait while our two drink tab was settled. No greeting or thank you. Not a friendly bartender at all. I'd advise stopping somewhere else down the road!"}
{"text":"Paige was my waitress and she was honestly incredible! She had all of my food out in a really fast manner and she was so friendly! She answered all of my questions about the menu and I really enjoyed what I ended up ordering! Can't wait to return! Would like to be served by paige once again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, HUGE DRINK BOWLS!! Would recommend to brunch and burger lovers everywhere. Great location on mill"}
{"text":"First timers - Yummy and great service!! Nice crunchy fries and tots with delicious blue cheese dressing to dip. The burger was juicy and the French dip was tender! Best part was our server's knowledge of the menu and her recommendation for Sparky Punch! Scored a free app of wings with Daytona sauce - PERFECTION - we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Natalie is life.   If you want a great experience in Tempe then you need to come to Americana and she will help guide you through the food and beverage menu!  We had a great time and can't wait to come back to Americana!"}
{"text":"Living the Americana dream!  That pretty well sums up my recent visit. The beer selections, delicious food, service and overall atmosphere were all on point. 

Atmosphere - This is a very cool spot right in the middle of the happening area of Tempe. The large bar with three roll up garage style doors, allows for the best of the indoors and out on a nice evening. Between sports on the TVs above the bar and the people watching on the sidewalk, Americana is the perfect drink spot. I witnessed about a 50/50 mix between college students (wish I would've have a hangout like this back then) and tourists. There is also a second bar located on the interior as well as a spacious dining area. 

The food - Regrettably, I only had the sliders from the appetizer menu. My small sampling was however enough that I'm fairly confident that there's no going wrong on any food choice here. The sliders are served, three of your choice with Angus, pulled pork, shaved steak, buffalo chicken or fried chicken. I choose two Angus and one steak. The shaved steak slider, with Provolone and au jus was very good. The Angus sliders on the other hand, we absolutely delicious. The thought of the robust flavor of the well seasoned, perfectly cooked beef in conjunction with the grilled onions, 1000 Island, pickles and cheddar on a pillowy top, bottom toasted bun has my mouth watering even now as I think back on it. Surprisingly the flavor of the beef maintained prominence despite the rich accompanying toppings. The menu consists of a handful of appetizers. My neighbors ordered the nachos (they come in a huge portion) and they resulted in some serious food envy. In addition to the appetizers, the menu consists of eleven different specialty burgers, all of which sound intriguing and a nice selection of \"premium handheld\" (sandwiches). There are also salads. While I'm sure they're great; don't do it!; not here. Then there are some gourmet Mac N Cheese options, a flat iron steak, shrimp skewers and a country fried chicken. I like that tots and sweet potato tots are in the line up as side options. Lastly, the brunch menu looks very enticing as well. 

The drinks - The menu boasts a handful of specialty cocktails and wines, both bars are well stocked and the tap options are extensive. I'm doubtful that any beer person won't find something here that will make them happy. The drafts come in 16 oz. or 32 oz. which is essentially a mini pitcher. I'm used to ordering the larger beer option when given a choice, but never pay attention to the ounces so I was a little surprised when my mini pitcher came out. Not to worry though, I handled it in quick order. 

The service - I couldn't have asked for any better. A shoutout to Adrienne (a named I remember thanks to her colorful Rocky reference) and her partner for being friendly and attentive. Despite the bartenders being fairly busy, I never waited on anything. 

In summary, if you're looking for a great place to catch a game or have happy hour in Tempe, this is a solid option. If burgers and beer speak to you, this is a winner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and nice brunch menu...the hostess, waitress and manager were all very friendly and they went out of their way to make our meal enjoyable. The food was very good with huge portions( four pancakes the size of your face) and great flavor on the salmon cakes and potatoes. The kicker was that I forgot my credit card and they emailed me right away and the manager agreed to deliver it to me after his shift -excellent service snd they will do well!"}
{"text":"Wow still amazing and only getting better. First things first....the Chili is spicier, Awesome. Ordered the Benedict Burger with Sweet Potato Tots and glad I didn't discriminate the Sweet Po's. However I should have consumed the Benedict open faced. It got messy..certainly a fork and knife situation. My kind server was awesome and not intrusive, she checked in on me at the right times."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family and I have to say the food was delicious, plus great service. We had the chicken wings, old school burger (yummy), tequila shrimp skewers (delicious if you're looking for a healthier option) and grilled chicken salad. Loved the outdoor patio, super cute! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here for the old school burger. Everything was delicious and very tasty. I cant wait to come back soon.
Awsome food and great happy servers"}
{"text":"This place was great! Hailey was our server and she was super helpful and enthusiastic the entire time! I would definitely come back again  food was amazing, get the loaded tots!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now.  We like the outdoor seating option.
They have a huge beer selection.  Happy hour specials.  I ordered 2 sliders for $6.00. Angus beef and pulled pork.  They were delicious and served with a smile. 
One night when we were at another bar,  one of the Americana servers recognized us and told us she'd give us a free round if we returned on the weekend during her shift.   We showed up on a Saturday, but she wasn't on shift yet. It didn't matter.   Another bartender gave us a round.  :).  Nice guys.  
The restaurant is huge. Lots of sports viewing on the big screens. 
Clean bathrooms.  No wifi, but I was able to scam it from another source.  
Nice view of the Tempe hill.  I'm not get to call it a mountain because I live in the Rockies.  Still, it's nice."}
