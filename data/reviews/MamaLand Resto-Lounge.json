{"text":"Mamaland is much more than an African-influenced restaurant and bar - It is a vibrant cultural centre. 

DJK, the owner, is one of the most genuinely good natured people you can meet. His goal is to make every patron feel welcome. The moment you walk in, you'll be taken by the rich and colourful decor - There are a number of thought-provoking quotes and African proverbs on the walls.

A number of different events are hosted at Mamaland - mostly with no cover charge. Live bands and DJs are frequently invited to get the crowd moving with music from all over Africa, the Carribean and South America.

I've been to a Brazilian dance party; grooved to soca and calypso rhythms during Caribana month; watched a stellar band celebrate Congolese independence and sang pop songs on Mamaland's karaoke night. There's always something fun going on! When people aren't on the dancefloor, DJK will bring out the pool tables. 

Now onto the best part - the food... There aren't too many restaurants in Toronto that serve meals from West Africa, so I'd encourage you to give it a try.

My favourite dish is the goat and plantain. The smoky goat has been seasoned and roasted to perfection and the plantain is sweet and tender - it practically melts in your mouth. Another favourite is the \"Poulet DG\", which is a spin on a popular chicken dish from Cameroon. If you'd prefer a typical Carribean meal, Mamaland serves up some hot and spicy jerk chicken. Whatever you order, you're guaranteed a huge portion and everything is reasonably priced. 

Regardless of whether you come for the music, the food, or just the atmosphere, you are guaranteed to have a wonderful time at Mamaland."}

{"text":"Went there after seeing such great reviews on yelp but was so dissapointed. We went on sat evening and it was so empty. Ppl didnt start coming in until after 9. Considering it was sat they had no  chicken and two menus to share amongst all the customers. The food was not fresh and all of us got violently sick afterwards...never again"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend on a recent trip to Toronto. The food is good, the music is great, and the drinks are cheap. It has a small stage in the center with lots of room for dancing. My problem, though, was with the management. When I complained about a particular male customer who was harassing me and my friend, the manager just shrugged it off.  We wound up having to leave early to get away from the jerk who was bothering us.  It's a shame because we were having a good time until then. I don't think I'll be going back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!!!!! Food taste amazing, great atmosphere. Found this little treasure by accident but it's definitely a staple now. Service is quite slow but it's worth the wait. I recommend the goat meat."}
