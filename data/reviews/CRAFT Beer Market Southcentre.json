{"text":"Great place and worth the wait! Went there fist week opened and few kinks but generally good. 
When arrived told it would be a 30-40 min wait but we could go to the mall and they would text us. This worked great and was only 20 min. 
Beer selection good. They were out of my original selection but recommended one and brought a few samples. 
Food arrived within 20 min and service very attentive. Only complaint would be the fish tacos could use more fish but the beer can chicken was fantastic. 
Definitely a welcome change to the area."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a large group, 19 ladies. I have to say the service and food was amazing.  They also were quite busy but are waitress never got flustered nor did she make one error. All our food came out together and promptly. I had my usual if it's on the menu fish tacos and they were great. Can't wait to try again"}
{"text":"I like craft! Amazing choice of beers plus the rotating tap. This place will satisfy any beer lover! The food is good! I'd say in pub standard probably some of the best! Long day and you are with you kid? No problem just take them in as it is a kid freindly establishment. Good quality food with some local sourcing which is great to see."}
{"text":"The staff are clueless- they tell you the wait is more than half hr so you leave and you get text not even 10min saying your table is ready.  The food is very small servings.  The price is on high side.  Tables ate awkward.  If you order nachos is comes in a metal let lid and the edges are sharp so be careful you don't cut yourself."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this location to open for like ever. They allow children in here as long as you get in before 9 p.m. 
I was here this Tuesday evening just after 5 p.m. The place was already busy with a 15 min. wait. Tonight they had fish tacos on sale for $3 each. They should call them soft tacos with hide and go seek fish. At our table my boys had a flatbread pizza, and a classic burger. I ordered one as well. My burger meat was a bit chewy, but my son said his was alright. I ordered mine with a mixed green salad, my son had the kale Caesar salad. They had a mix up and mine came out with soup. The waitress was quick in correcting the mix up. 
I asked for ketchup to put on my burger, and it never did show up. I was disappointed since I really like ketchup. Oh well, I had high hopes for this and was unfortunately let down.
Sorry but don't think I'll be back, at least for burgers.
On a side note, the kitchen is located upstairs. I guess that's why my ketchup never showed  up. The waitress said it had to come from upstairs lol.
The waitress was friendly enough, but the person that seated us looked less than thrilled about her job."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for a table.. average as the first time was 50.

Their Food was better the first time. I had the burger with bacon and blue cheese..... there was so much topping this time that it made the bun super soggy. I had to eat it with a fork and knife. fries were good but preferred the Mac and cheese as a side.

Buddy had the side salad with kale and he mentioned it was great.

I think their problem is that they're trying to pump out as many tables as they can and it's having an effect on their food quality. It'll hopefully improve over time but I don't see it happening any time soon.

The only other thing is the music is very loud. Loud to the point where you have to basically yell if you want to chat."}
{"text":"A bit of a disappointment. Small food and beverage portions for the price. Had the Mezze Platter and it was terrible. I normally think of platters as something to share but there wasn't enough food for one person! It was laughable. I wish I had taken a picture."}
{"text":"The beer is always good. The food was too. We were here for the grand opening. The place was busy and service left me with no empty beer and a smile. I will return. Sometimes I think the business of a place like this gets in the way of fun. With so many beer options I would like a better way of trying some of the MANY different beers they have to offer. Cheers"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic get together with friends here, great atmosphere. The only thing is that the music was way way too loud, it was hard to carry on a conversation.  I would go back though, fantastic selection of craft beer"}

As a result of the previous review I wrote regarding my visit to Craft Beer Market. The manager contacted me and asked me to give it another try. I came here today with my family, we were a group of 5 to see if it would be different. We ordered cedars to drink, white sangria and flights of beer which were local and a good deal- $9 for 23 ounces instead of $12. We got the barrel of nachos which looks deceiving because of how it is served but is still quite a bit. However, the nachos were not served t our liking such as on the menu it says tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc all comes on the nachos and for some reason it all came in a bowl on the side instead of on the nachos or being baked on the nachos. I don't know if they always do this but then we just dumped it all on. Other than that the nachos were good. 
We also got the fast-food sushi which is interesting. 
The patio outside is amazing. 
My rating now moved from 1 star to 3.

I had been wanting to try this place for a while because I live in the Deep South and the closest craft is downtown which sometimes is not the easiest to get to. I was happy when this place opened a while back but I wasn't able to try it u til now because I was hearing it was so hard to get into with long wait times etc. Finally my friends and I decided to go on a Friday at 3:00pm. There was 9 of us so we got arable for 8 (with 4 chairs on each side and put one at the end). Eventually most of us decided to leave (to be specific 3 of us left so there was 5 of us left at the table). We decided that we would all pay our tabs at the same time to make it easier on the waiter and the 5 of us who were staying also ordered one more beer and just told the waiter to add it to the bill so that we wouldn't have a beer to or bill to pay later. He said that was fine and did it. After our 3 friends left and there were 5 of us left the acting supervisor or manager. Came over to our table and asked us to leave ...? We were sitting there talking to each other  and had no idea why she would ask us to  leave? She said we had our bills in our hand so assumed we paid. We said that we did but we had our another beer on our tab and we're waiting for it to come. She was very upset and said that she had to. Heck with the waiter to make sure and sure enough she checked with him and he said that yes we had one more round coming. She told us this was unacceptable for five people to take up a table for 8 people because she had a huge waitlist of people that needed seating. Well that's not our fault. She made us very uncomfortable especially after 9 of us just being there had a huge bill. 
They have officially lost our business as a result of this."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Excellent service. We sat at the bar while we waited for our table and were very impressed by the selection of beers. The bar tender was helpful and friendly too. We ordered wings which were good but nothing special. Our meals were fantastic though and the service was great. Only complaint was that the music was quite loud so it was a bit hard to talk."}
{"text":"We were there for Sunday brunch. The food was nicely presented and delicious. The servers need more time on their feet to be more organized.  Also, the servers need more training on handling dishes correctly. I did not use my cups after the were brought to the table as he wrapped his fingers around the rims. Will go back in a few weeks to see if there is any progress."}
{"text":"Food was good. But the service was very bad. 

Ordered food appetizers and meal all came at once. They said they would take mains back and bring new ones which was nice.  2 people asked if I wanted another club Soda. Neither brought one.  Must have 1 non alcoholic drink policy.   Got to sit beside 6 drunk loud idiots."}
{"text":"First time to Craft Beer at South Centre and experience very similar to the downtown location. 

Very lively bar with loud music and lots noise. Haha. 

Huge and I mean huge beer selection. 

Food menu is equally impressive. Staff are very friendly and attentive. 

Lots of seats and booths (bonus). 

Great place to go with friends for a night out. 

Overall pricing is fantastic and can't go wrong with Beer Craft."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place was hopping when we stopped by. I was looking forward to another CRAFT opening in the south closer to my place, we stopped by during the rush of holiday shopping and since CRAFT is in Southcentre Mall it makes sense things were busy, they'll text you when the table is ready though so you don't have to just hover at the entrance. Great long list of beer to choose from and the same menu as the downtown location. We ordered fish tacos and a crispy chicken sandwich, both were great. Our server was also very friendly and chatty, when we're in the area or shopping we'd definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood so were excited to see Craft set up shop nearby. 

We initially tried to eat here a few weeks ago, but were turned away at the front desk due to a private party (no signage on the outside to specify that). So we gave it some time. 
We tried it out tonight and it was pretty good. What with the place being packed and really loud music, we didn't get to kick back, relax, and chat because we couldn't hear each other (and we're not even deaf, go figure!). I had the crispy chicken sandwich and thought it was awesome. My fella had the Classic burger and thought it was \"just ok.\" We started with the fried pickles, which didn't disappoint. Our server was really kind and quick, and we didn't have to wait long for anything at all. She was fantastic. 
The food was good, but I don't think I'll make this a regular haunt because having to yell to have a chit chat is exhausting on a night out after a long day. I will say though, for being a new spot, they're doing well overall."}
{"text":"I have been here twice this week, mixed experiences. Monday burger was good but we were sat next to the doorway and stairs servers use and had to listen to them yelling corner nonstop. Today 3 of us had the fish tacos and they looked great but were lacking fish!! The other 2 meals were good, korean chicken wraps and a beef dish. 

Room is nice, service just ok. Beer cold and plenty of choices. All in all it's mall food."}
{"text":"So Craft is a lot of wonderful descriptive words but quiet isn't one of them.  
Craft has an interesting venue with stimulating decor, excellent food and a huge selection of brews.  There is a reason as to why this establishment is so busy.  And I have listed all of them.

Now, to tell you about my experience.  I wanted to make a reso on a Friday evening.  Now they do not accept reservations after 4:45 on the weekend.  The only reason I needed one was because my mom is in a wheelchair and needs a table that is of regular height.  There were also 6 of us.  Anyway, I spoke to the manager and she was so great about my request:  she did say that she'd put a note in for the hostess to ensure there'd be a table for us.  By golly, when we rolled in there at 5:30 they took us to a table immediately.  What a relief and how happy I felt knowing that there wouldn't be a problem having my mom enjoy such a venue.  
Our server was professional, courteous and gracious.  The place was bustling and the kitchen was reflective of how busy Craft was at that time.  Now, a word to the wise, if you want to go there for a pint or a glass and enjoy a meal chatting about the meaning of life, this is not the place on a Friday night.  Don't even try.  The music is super loud over the high quality Bose speakers and there are no sound absorbers for the \"over the music\" loud talking that surrounds you.  That is the only complaint I have of the place.  Other than that, I will be back; maybe on an early Sunday afternoon or a Tuesday afternoon because the food is excellent and the atmosphere is hip."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this new location! Love the atmosphere and decor. Staff have been great on my two visits. On one occasion I had lunch (butternut squash ravioli), my mouth is watering just thinking about it. It's nice that Southcentre now has a nice sit down restaurant conveniently located attached to the mall (entrance is from outside). 
The only disappointment is that you cannot make a reservation after 5pm on a weekend. We had wanted to plan my 35th here, but we went elsewhere so we could reserve at 7pm."}
{"text":"A dark place with noisy atmosphere.  I asked for a quiet table and was informed that since I was alone I should sit at the bar even though it was mid-afternoon and only a handful of tables were in use.  The bartender took my order, another person served it by handing the bowl to me - from behind, with a scowl on her face.  No one asked how it was or if I'd like anything else, like another drink or dessert. I had the Ahi Poke Bowl, which was served at room temperature and by the time I got home I was incredibly sick.  I was so hungry as I had yet to eat that day so I did eat half of it even though it was bland and everything was chopped up into small pieces as if prepared for a toddler.  The wine is served in 5oz portions instead of the standard 6oz and mine came in what looked like a small pop bottle, which was not clean.  All around horrible experience.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"20 min wait and I counted 7 tables open?? Very understaffed, like 12 groups waiting to be seated.  The upstairs was completely empty. If I was an owner, watching people leave my eatery because there are many seats open??  I would lose my mind!!  5 groups left and we still waited.  I understand when the place is full, it's my choice to wait, but open seating just sitting there begging me to spend money??    Fail! It's a new place, lots of choices out there craft!! 

Home of the $17.50 hamburger.  Prices are very high for a pub.  $8 for a beer!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here the other night. I won a couple of passes for their grand opening celebration.

Walking in I was greeted by a couple of ladies who explained how the event worked and gave me a couple of tokens redeemable for any drink under $10 (no beer floats, sad face).

They had food stations setup throughout the restaurant so you could fill up small plates of samples to get a taste of their menu. 

The event was self seating so at larger tables you had to cuddle up to strangers. This was fun though as my brother and I ended up sitting beside a 60-ish year old couple from Texas and chatted for an hour about beer...and Trump of course.

Craft had a ton of staff working. Our server was right on things with keeping our glasses full and getting us some of the food we ordered off the menu. There was a little bit of confusion with the runners bringing the beers out to the tables as when you have a few different groups at a large table it's hard to tell who ordered what. But they did a great job nonetheless.

I gave the fried pickles and wings a try. The pickles were great as well as the wings. For the wings they keep it simple, you get a choice of salt & pepper or hot. 

The space itself is pretty large with two levels and a small patio out front. The front of the building out to the patio is wide open with tall windows so even if you're not right out on the patio you can still get a breeze and the sunshine. Upstairs there's tons of TV's to watch the game and the kitchen is also located there. It's open to the dining area so you can watch everyone's meals being prepared. 

So many great things to talk about and I haven't even talked about the BEER yet! They have around 100 on tap and they're all craft selections (duh!). They're not only just craft, but the majority of the selection is local within Alberta. They do have some some great options from elsewhere too like Jerkface 9000 (Vancouver) and The Dutchess (Belgium).

Great to see Craft opening a second location in Calgary finally and it's awesome to have something like this at the south end of the city so I don't have to go downtown to enjoy some awesome craft beer."}
{"text":"Happy to see a \"non-major-chain\" restaurant open in South Calgary. Nice to be able to drive 5 minutes from home rather than 20 to get down to the Beltline. The food was pretty good, although the wings were not meaty enough. The beer selection is always great, so you can't go wrong there. Will be back!"}
