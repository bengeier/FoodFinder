{"text":"\"So, are you going to eat a steak first?\"\"You might want to sneak some meat in with you.\"\"Enjoy your...vegetables.\"

These were not uncommon responses from folks when I said I'd be heading to Live Food Bar. I too was skeptical but went along for the ride anyways when a friend suggested we go. While perusing the online menu, I was genuinely stumped as to what I would get. I already eat at least one - but generally several - vegetarian meals a week, so I'm not opposed to eating a meal with no meat. But Live is a vegan, organic restaurant that features recipes without gluten, without sugar and certainly without any animal products which is outside my culinary experience. If you happen to feel the same way, I suggest you go with an open mind as Live has an excellent reputation and it is well earned. 

I settled in to the table at the front, which has a great view of the world walking by, of the bright, cheerful restaurant. While I waited for my dining companions, I had a look through the drink list and eventually settled on a bottle Mill Street Organic. (Should I come back in the summer, I will definitely sample the cocktails on the lovely patio!) When the ladies arrived, we ordered a bottle of organic cabernet sauvignon and started going over the menu for the millionth time. It is an extensive list with dishes that should appeal to just about all diners. Appetizers, salads, bowls, mains, pasta, dessert: Live certainly does not lack for choice. The three of us agreed that we wanted to try the chick pea fries, so we ordered those while attempting to make a decision.

Finally, we made our choices: raw sushi with pumpkin & sunflower seed nori rolls and a detox salad; \"Bacon Cheese\" burger; and tempeh cakes with a warm corn, avocado and white wine salsa. Orders placed, we tucked into our wine and the chick pea fries which arrived shortly thereafter. Crispy on the outside, piping hot and soft on the inside, this non-traditional take on a staple hit the spot, especially with the homemade BBQ sauce on the side.

Our mains arrived in a timely manner, and we hungrily tucked in to them. The sushi roll had a great combination of flavour and texture. I was a little jealous of not ordering that one for myself, but my giant plate of food was more than enough. The tempeh (an Indonesian soybean product) cakes were piled high on top of the wonderful salsa that was accompanied by a spicy chipotle aioli. If you're hungry, get this dish. It was undoubtedly for the best that I did not order an appetizer, as well as the cakes and sides were so surprisingly good that I was nearly scraping my plate. 

As for the \"cheese bacon\" burger, it passed the taste test. The patty consisted of chick peas and had macadamia cheddar \"cheese\" and eggplant \"bacon.\" I can see your eyebrows raising. The eggplant had a smoky flavour and was quite good, though certainly not bacon. The cheese in question was a bit of a head-scratcher, though not unpleasant. The gluten-free bun was nicely toasted and the BBQ sauce was a great touch.

Since we had already gone through much of the menu, we thought we should give dessert a whirl. All the desserts are kept on display in near the back of the restaurant, and there is quite an array from which to choose. We opted for two: the tiramisu and the Black Forrest cake. Now, my Italian friends would be horrified to find a tiramisu without real cream, but it really was quite good with a strong, but not overpowering, taste of espresso. Similarly, the Black Forrest cake was rich, creamy and cut nicely with the cherries on top. No complaints - I certainly didn't feel like I was missing out.

Live has a great vibe to it and customers were constantly arriving either to have a seated meal or to pick up their take-out orders. The music is at just the right volume and the staff is friendly and accommodating. We were there for several hours and never felt rushed, nor got the idea that we were no longer welcome. Food arrives promptly and with a smile, water bottles are refilled, and the service is relaxed. So take your vegetarian friends, take your carnivorous friends: they will likely all be satisfied. The portions are well-sized and, most importantly, the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Very pretty restaurant!

Judging from the Paleo Bowl, it is possible to be well satiated here.  Pick wisely-- Look out for ingredients like avocado, sweet potato, tofu and tempeh.  I found the Detox Salad to be on the small side.  Also on the salty side.  But then I did dump the entire contents of the dressing container.  Note: Don't do this.

They have a deceptively large and gorgeous shaded patio out back."}
{"text":"I really like Live. There's a beautiful patio out back - perfect for enjoying a tea or beer or a cocktail of tea and beer mixed together (barf). 

One of the things I like is that there's a real sense of pride about what they do - they make delicious, unbelievable food out of beautiful raw ingredients. There's no goofy funny vibe, like oh, haha, this is so crazy, I'm somewhere that serves RAW food hey waiter I think the chef forgot to cook my meal hahaha hahhahahahahha somebody punch me. It's not a novelty restaurant that you just \"try\" for \"fun\" - this is a nice meal out at a nice place.

And it is. The preparation is always beautiful - the sandwiches, wraps, and raw plates all have bright greens in accompaniment, and things like \"dehydrated onion-flax bread\" are earthy-looking and pretty. Nothing here is bland, vegan mush. I'm not saying that as a carnivore who hearts bacon too much to give tempeh a fair chance - I was a vegan for months, and I happily cooked myself and ate PLENTY of mush. It was tasty! Just not very pretty. The food here looks like Tyra Banks. It is fierce.

It also tastes great. I've been here a ton, and almost everything is good. My favorite is the burdock burrito - the kimchi in it is amazing, and I'm pretty sure Live makes their own. The wraps and sandwiches are all good. I find their 'burger' patties can be on the blander side, but the sauces and extras more than make up for it. Definitely recommend trying to raw platter, too. At $20, it's  kinda steep, but you get a lot of food (be warned though, that it's hard to split...messy....) but if you're eating here to try cool raw things, this is what to go for. In many times eating there, I've only had one thing I didn't like - raw gazpacho. There was barely any tomato in it, and it was syrupy and sweet. Do not want, would not eat again.

The smoothies are ok - I'm not big on smoothies anyway. Desserts are delicious but REALLY heavy and sweet. And I think that's my one big criticism. I feel that icky full/sickish feeling after eating here - they don't use butter or cream, obviously, but there's a lot of cashews and lots of sweetener in the desserts, and the sauces on the dishes can still manage to be quite rich. I wish they had a few options that were still flavorful, but maybe a little lighter."}
{"text":"Tonight I had takeout from Live, paleo bowl.$20, I was very very very  upset when I reached home to find that a spoon full of food is what I got. I will never go back to this establishment. Way to overpriced. The customer service is terrible, it's not the first time I've had a problem there."}
{"text":"Would still give 4 stars for their food. Prices are reasonable, especially for their juice. Usually organic juice bars are expensive. For here, all juices are 10 and you can sit down, the vibe is fine."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The pulled burdock wrap is fantastic. Very spacious back patio & cozy interior."}
{"text":"I went to Live in April 2008 with a friend who was visiting from out of town. We both ordered entrees that came with salads. We were served our salads and finished them. My friend got her entree, but about half way through, I still hadn't gotten mine. They were sort of busy, so I assumed it was just taking awhile. However, the waitress eventually came with the bill and I still hadn't gotten my meal. We told her and she went back to the kitchen to \"work something out\". A manager or something (a blonde, tanorexic type) came out and gave us our bill. They discounted my salad 10% and my friend's meal 10%. That's right, they still charged me for my salad. The woman also told me that \"next time\" (as if I would go to this ridiculous place again) I should let them now that my food hadn't arrived, essentially blaming me for them screwing up my order and leaving me hungry! I have worked in the food service industry for years and I'd never experienced anything like this before. I was supposed to assume they were totally incompetent as opposed to totally slow? Okay, I'll be sure to do that \"next time\".
I understand that mistakes happen and sometimes orders can get misplaced or whatever in a kitchen. It would have been fine if that woman hadn't tried to put the blame on me. She should have just apologized and admitted they made a mistake. I also can't believe they thought 10% off my paltry salad was adequate compensation. It was so tacky and lame."}
{"text":"Today was warm and sunny, a perfect day to enjoy Live's backyard patio under the shade of its purple umbrellas and leafy trees. 

Bright orange tables and chairs, lively abstract murals, hanging plants and wooden benches add to its naturally cheerful environment. 

And there are trains. One reason I chose Live was because my grandson loves trains and I thought the tracks running along the back might be kind of cool, but the high fence and wall of trees keep the trains out of view. 
 Of course we could hear them passing by, which was a pretty nice bonus if you like that sort of thing.

Deciding what to order when one of the group is under the age of 2 took us a while, but we opted for the root fries [$10] and the Big Bowl Salad [$12].  Good choices!

He thoroughly enjoyed the very thinly cut crispy curls of sweet potato, taro, potato and celery root, although he did not use the chipotle aioli or wasabi mayo. 
Frankly he may have enjoyed those too; we just didn't give them to him.

We chose the tangy umeboshi dressing to top off the Big Bowl of mixed greens, sunflower sesame hummus [really tasty!], shredded carrot, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, seeds and more.  And we got to throw on some of the root fries for added crunch.
It's nice to share.

Previously at Live I've had the Uber Protein Bowl [$13]: chickpeas, tempeh croutons, cranberries, goji berries, seeds and quinoa on mixed greens.  That's a favourite.

The service was very good.  We did understandably have to wait for our meal - everything is prepared when you order - but our littlest guest was kept amused by birds and airplanes and other diners, so it all worked out quite well.
A lovely lunch at Live."}
{"text":"Probably top raw food in Toronto!

I've tried many Live Raw foods at grocery stores, from their juice to their raw crackers and breads, and recently was able to come for lunch. It's location in the annex is right by Dupont station and the restaurant itself is airy and light, with cozy wooden booths and little flowers on each table. They offer packaged foods for sale in the front and have an extensive dessert counter for take-home or eat-in foods. I purchased the raw black forest cake to take home and it was absolutely fantastic. For the price it was so worth it.

Although it's called Live Raw, there are many cooked options on the menu to suit doubters of vegan cuisine. I shared the nachos as a start; they were perfect and very filling. Plating was nice and the guacamole tasted fresh. For my main, I had the sunshine wrap while my mother ordered the tasting quartet. The sunshine wrap was good, served with a size coleslaw. It was very big and I found it to be repetitive as I tried to finish it. The wrap was strong in taste and I found after a while it was quite boring to eat, but maybe that's just me. It was very good at the beginning, though. The coleslaw was fine but seemed to just be doused in oil, and the menu said it would come with a side kale caesar so I was surprised. The raw quartet was good value and seems like a good choice for anyone who gets bored easily. It came with the manicotti, pizza, tostadas, and mushroom. The manicotti and mushroom were very good.

For dessert, I shared the pecan pie. It was quite tasty but compared to the black forest cake it was not nearly as flavourful!

Overall I recommend Live Raw, whether you're vegan or an omnivore it's great."}
{"text":"Took my California cousin there for lunch with my daughter, who is a vegetarian. We sat in the back patio which is well hidden, but is a great sunny space in the middle of the city. It was a beautiful day, not too warm and the shade provided by the umbrella was more than adequate.  Our server was very pleasant with a wry sense of humor. I started off with the cream of mushroom soup and had the portobello steak, my daughter had tacos, and my cousin had the burdock burrito. All were excellent! The drinks were also intriguing with my lime seltzer being delicious as was the smoothie. The server thoughtfully poured it into 2 smaller glasses rather than having to share it in one large glass. I had eaten there before and the food that time was also very good. I highly recommend this vegan restaurant. It serves the goods without any sacrifice in taste."}
{"text":"This place is the best! In summer and in the winter. In the winter their soups cant be beat, and in the summer their back patio is like a little oasis in the city - I promise I could sit there all day. Their teas and ice teas are strong and delicious, their salads are super tasty, and the fresh almond milk that they serve with the coffee? Yummmmmm!
My only complaint would be that they got rid of their soup and salad lunch special during the week, which was a great deal - but honestly, ordering the same two items separately isn't too much more expensive.
This place is the place to go for a fresh, healthy, satisfying meal any time of the year!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Live Organic Food Bar many-a-time, but last night was the first time I sat in the back on the patio.  It is a lovely space with plenty of room and was perfect for a mild, pleasant Monday eve.

They did keep forgetting to bring us water, but the food came out quickly, so no complaints.  We ordered the nachos with guacamole.  Yum.  It was colourful, flavourful and a great appetizer to share with a friend.

Now before I continue, you need to be warned that you have the choices of Raw or Cooked vegan food.  I always order from the Cooked after eating off the Raw menu a couple of years ago and feeling very unwell for a day or two afterwards.

My friend ordered the chickpea burger (Cooked) and loved it.  I ordered the Chipotle Grilled Tofu sandwich (that isn't what it's called, but you'll find it, also Cooked).  It was also very tasty.  What I noticed about all sandwiches and burgers here is that they crumble.  It doesn't bother me, but may bother some people.  All sandwiches and burgers come with a little side of sweet potato chips.

The food here is very fresh and tasty, but I noticed the prices have gone up since I last ate here.  I was not a happy camper when my bill came out to $26.00 (after tip) for a burger and half an appetizer.  The price is the only thing that will keep me from not coming here as often as I would want to."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! So worth trying out they have tons of options nd u dont feel guilty afterwards bcus its all mainly raw  the nachos were especially good!! So worth getting it all tastes so fresh and flavourful  love this place cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"This is without doubt the best vegetarian/ raw food restaurant in Toronto. The desserts here are also exceptionally good."}
{"text":"I love this place they have the freshest food most unique meals and I can taste my black bean burrito for hours after I've eaten it. I don't even want to eat anything else until the next day because I want to taste to linger in my mouth!. It is so amazing I'm going to post a photo but the photo of course won't do it justice. Then you have to try their kale chips my favourite being the cheese ones! No or can you find kale chips as tasty as these or is crisp and fresh as these. Unlikely we can now find these in grocery stores to though I was check the expiry date since some people aren't is into healthy food as I am so they can linger on their shows a little too long in the stores. And you don't want to miss that organic vegetable drinks either. Trust me. Unless of course you have a juicer at home but hey why not have a juice out as well in the middle of your day ! 

Lastly their chocolate. I don't know if you could call them chocolate truffles since they just melt in your mouth or what they call them I can't remember. It's probably the coconut butter in them but there's something about how they're made that makes them just melt in your mouth unlike any other all natural chocolate truffles that you could ever try period. They're very addictive though so be careful.

 I'll add more later the next time their menus in front of me and I can't remember what else I've eaten that blew me away. My only wish is larger portions for the price but yes when you're cooking organic it cost a bit more!

No and I'm just glad I can find some of their products including my favourite the sweet potato noodles with vegetables at the big carrot and other major health food stores as it's hard not to get my weekly fix!"}
{"text":"Extremely expensive. Had the raw combo for $22 and had the tiniest portion ever. The food tasted weird. One nice wait or buy another really nice waitress. Expensive desert but that was good. Left hungry."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Just absolutely deliciously fantastic.
A lot of people don't think you can get much taste out of a raw-food joint, but Live really nails it. 
They have a takeout counter in the front, a sort of cafeteria vibe inside and a gorgeous garden back patio that is absolutely serene in the summer.

it ain't cheap, but neither is your health. Get the maki appetizer coupled with any one of their bowls (they are all delicious) and make sure you don't leave without taking an E3 Live shot. That's the stuff dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Great for people with food restrictions however my first expierience they forgot about us on the patio for an hour I served my own water.Second visit had pho thanksiving everything just tasted salty not enough flavour choked back my food my blu tini was nice though  had hemp hearts great to get your omega three with your alcohol. My friends black bean burrito was much better with house salad which was tasty would choose fresh in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place. The back patio in the summer, the organic wines and yummy cocktails, the food and the service are all pretty damn good. Great to  take your meatatarian friends and let them relish a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to visit live because of the rave for the restaurant on this site. When me and my friend went in, we were greeted with slightly cold, snotty waiters. Then looking at the menu, we both decided to order the detox salad. Despite the appealing description, the salad was everything but.
The kelp noodles were absolutely disgusting, extremely over salted and there was nothing in the dish except a large lump of kelp noodles, some seaweed and an avocado. 
Since we took the food as takeout, we weren't able to complain but if we could, we definitely would have. Usually in love with raw vegan food, this was absolutely the worst tasting shit I've ever had, and an extreme waste of $12. 
The seating was also extremely cramped, I could literally hear every word of the conversation of the table next to me.
I'm going to give live the benefit of the doubt, since some other dishes looked promising, hence the 2 stars. 
But based on the salad, service, it's a definite 2. 
DO NOT ORDER THE DETOX SALAD!"}
{"text":"I am a bit of a skeptic in most this type of food but I have to say that food here was very good. I had a chickpea burger and corn chowder. I think the mix of cooked and raw is great and allows for people to choose.  Easy parking and bright location. Service takes time so do come with time to spare. Good eating!"}
{"text":"Super quick and friendly service. I had the Kale Caesar salad and the soup of the day. Both were delicious and amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Desserts are almost excellent  (tiramisu, strawberry cake, lemon cake, carrot cake) but too sweet for me, but thankfully no stevia.  
Will change my review to four stars if Live would please make their delicious desserts about 50% less sweet.  Thanks."}
{"text":"This place had a nice atmosphere and my desert was delicious. My Ceaser salad was disappointing however. Too many sundries to,a toes and not enough coconut bacon."}
{"text":"So many options on the menu! My sister and I shared the nachos and the mediterranean plate (the cashew cheese is so delicious) and it was extremely satisfying and filling. This place is great even if you aren't a vegan, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent! I love the food! Customer service is great. You will not be disappointed. Location is a bit of a challenge but you can park at lcbo. Overall 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome!  For enthusiasts of healthy, raw and vegan food, Live is as good as it gets.  The organic juice and smoothie selection is delightful and the food is even more impressive.  The menu is filled from top to bottom with gourmet-quality raw and cooked vegan dishes that are creative, diverse and delicious.  The portions are generous and the prices are quite reasonable when you consider the high level of quality.  The staff is very nice and accommodating and the overall vibe of the place is mellow, serene and happy.  This is a special little restaurant!"}
{"text":"I thought the omelette, coffee, and salads were excellent.  If you are vegan, my opinion is that you will really appreciate the food.  I don't care much for small cramped restaurants where you can hear everyone's conversation, but for some people, eating out at such restaurants is a performance art - laughing loudly, tossing the hair.  All they're missing is someone to film them.  OK, apart from that, I mostly hate small restaurants because you have to observe so much work going on and it's not always pretty. Uncleaned tables pile up.  The incompetence with the table bussing really bugged me.  I hate looking at an abandoned table's dirty smoothie glasses for 20 minutes when I'm trying to eat my meal - it makes me gag.  It's worse when there are three or four tables like that all around you.  And oh boy, watch them actually clean tables - it's like watching a 12 year old child with ADD try to do it.  For future reference, Live, don't remove glasses by sticking your fingers in the glass and for sure if you do that, please don't be the waiter who brings me my meal two minutes later.  And on a final note, if you're serving tables, don't just wear a camisole with a bra showing underneath.  Learn some professionalism and remember, we're trying to eat."}
{"text":"The Best Vegan restaurant in Toronto hands down, I love this place-how could you possibly complain about healthy, luscious food that is good for you topped off with great bevy's and dessert that rocks.  I am having a bro-mance with Live, its official."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for business meetings. Our clients always rave about their meals. The food is exceptional and worth the price. Their deserts cannot be out done. Stellar dishes are the Kale Caesar Salad, Raw Dairy-Free Grain-Free Manicotti and Butterscotch Ripple Smoothie. Favourite desert is the Sinfully Black Forest Cake. 

The creativity and artistry of the chefs is outstanding. Everything is so beautiful!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend on a sunday afternoon. As a full time vegetarian who also enjoys vegan food, i am so happy that more and more vego friendly places are cropping up. Makes going out to eat much more enjoyable when i can order something other than a vegie burger! This place had a relaxed atmosphere and was not too busy at all. Our server was welcoming and polite and seated us immediately. I had the huevos rancheros and my gf had the english breakfast. Both were generous portions and yummy. My gf wished there was some sort of jam or spread for her english muffin as it was a bit dry on it's own but other than that small preference the food was great. The chai lattes we had were good too (almond and coconut milk options were nice!). It's a shame they don't do coffee but they do have a coffee alternative.. I wasn't game enough to try it this time but maybe next time as we will most certainly be back to try out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Live Organic Food Bar is tasty!

I enjoyed lunch there about a month ago with a friend and her SO and it was great.
I left there feeling very healthy and energized for the day.
i tried the vegan \"pad thai,\" lots of crunchy nuts, a super-yummy thai inspired sauce, julienne zucchini and other veggies. It was amazing. My mouth is watering right now as I write this.
My friend had the \"lasagne\" and it looked great.
I also had an excellent americano coffee with rice milk.
Our server was attentive, knowledgeable and also laid back giving us enough time to savour our meal.
 I'd def. go there again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Came here for my birthday and my non vegan parents loved this place and the food :) We've been to fresh on spadina and this place doesn't even compare oh my goodness...the food is bursting with flavour and truly shows HOW GOOD VEGAN FOOD CAN TASTE! Many gluten free and nut free options. Wish the service and wait time for food was a bit faster, but the yummy dishes make up for it"}
{"text":"Visiting Live was my first raw food experience. I was open-minded and tried a variety of things. I had the liquid plumber plus maca to drink, shared the sample appetizer plate with my sister and then also one of the warm rice bowls. I ended with the tiramisu. My sister had the coconut cleanse plus milk thistle, shared the appetizer/main with me and had the pecan pie for dessert. We ended it all with herbal tea and an almond milk latte.

Overall we both weren't blow away. My sister has been to many more raw food restaurants and had eaten better, whilst I was just a newbie trying to figure it all out. The best part of the meal were the drinks and the dessert. The appetizer was a 6 and the main was a 7. The menu price was a bit disappointing too.

Nothing too spectacular with this first experience but knowing how good for my body the meal was made up for it. I'd definitely give this restaurant a second chance but try completely different things.

Also, the staff are all very friendly and helpful. Another reason I'd go back."}
{"text":"The chef is truly gifted... how she manages to make everything taste like its cooked counterparts I'm not sure. It is quite amazing! My mother and friends had almond dream bars and tiramisu cake and had no idea it was my \"rabbit food\"!!! My favorites are: sushi w/ pecan pate and nacho chips!... and ALL the desserts!!!! Esp. the strawberry cheesecake:)

I did buy the un-cook book!

Staff are friendly and accommodating, the restaurant is bright and trendy.
Don't know about the cooked, but the raw food is fantastic! 
I did have to drive around to find parking, but I'm not familiar with the area."}
{"text":"This is the best organic restaurant in Toronto - the menu is diverse and savory, and the food is an amazing blend of healthy and hearty."}
{"text":"Being new to Toronto, and having not figured out the transit system, I walked an hour and a half to get to this restaurant. To be sure, it was worth working up and appetite for. As a woman who is already a fan of raw food and taking care of herself, I have to say this was effing amazing. As a woman who used to eat highly processed, fried foods and lived by her taste buds alone, I have to say this was beyond amazing. Wanting everything on the menu, I got the \"Raw Combo Platter\". Pizza. Steak 'n' mashed potatoes. Tacos. Spaghetti. Things I haven't eaten in months and far tastier and more satisfying than I can ever recall the original versions being. I was stuffed to the brim after having dessert, but felt completely rejuvenated rather than weighed down. The service was wonderful. The atmosphere was casual enough that I felt at ease eating on my own. I was exceptionally glad to see that there were many nut free options on the menu and my meal contained very little flax. Most of the raw restaurants I've been to seem to rely too much on both. ;) In the end, I would walk another two hours to make it back there tomorrow."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the flavour of the food was good, but everything else was beyond disappointing. 

The spritzer was warm, flat and the cup was only 3/4 full. The juice was bitter and tart considering it was supposed to be fruity. I ended up mixing it with my own berries at home to sweeten it up.

The guacamole was literally just a large tablespoon of guac accompanied by 5 crackers. Taste was great, but the portion was a ripoff. I also kept finding small blue plastic hairs stuck in my teeth. *Gag*

The taco was falling apart. Whatever the soft shell was made of couldn't hold the weight of the contents of the taco. It was literally ripped into multiple pieces the first time I picked it up. The \"refried beans\" were completely cold and the consistency was unappetizing. 

Overall, I'm super disappointed that I ordered from them."}

{"text":"So yeah going to Live was my first raw food experience.  I never really would have considered going before say 3 months ago.  but i recently became a vegetarian ( so a little more open minded ), and it was my girlfriends turn to choose where we went to eat on date night....

The atmosphere was colourful and welcoming.  Very vibrant!  The staff were very welcoming, and obviously used to people coming and eating raw for the first time.

For a starter we shared the polenta fries with chipotle aioli ( one of the newly added cooked options ) which were amazing, very simple, but an excellent option.  


We then had the Raw Combo which is a sampling of all the raw mains.  i highly recommend this. it gives you a chance to try everything, and it's the perfect portion for 2 to share.  I can't say i fell in love with everything.  the crust for the Pizza M'On left me wanting more, but i really enjoyed everything else, especially the Spaghetti\".

And finally dessert.  I'm not really much of a desert guy, i lost mt sweet tooth long ago, but i went for it anyway and was presently surprised.  i can't remember the names... we had a lemon square type thing, and this chocolate desert that resembled a REESE'S Peanut Butter Cup.

So all and all a great experience... and i would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! We had brunch and were totally satisfied! The best kale vegan Cesar salad ever! Hubby had breakfast burrito and loved it. We topped it off with a delicious Black Forest cake. Yuuum!!! Vegan food at its best!!!"}
{"text":"Oh dayummm, y'all. Sometimes I find excuses to go to Dupont, just so I can hit up Live. Actually, my latest excuse to go to Dupont is just \"hit up Live\". It's divine. 

I love their big salad bowl, I love their juices and smoothies and refreshing spritzers, I love their raw lasagna and I'd probably love their desserts if I ever had any room to try them. I'd like to love the spaghetti but I've yet to try it (there is so dang much to choose from).

A few years ago I used to think raw was silly, but I was ig'nant. SO VERY IG'NANT. Not everything on the menu is raw, but a good portion of it is. Plus: they've also got a lovely brunch menu! 

In conclusion, life is better now with Live in my world."}
{"text":"On a long layover we stopped here to grab some authentic organic veggie food. We were able to have an amazing three course meal. It was a bit pricey--even for Toronto--but the presentation, taste and variety of ingredients was just right. The service was great and they let us crash there for a couple of hours too. This is perhaps the best restaurant I've been to in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to eat in Toronto! I've gone countless times, and it's always amazing. I especially love the Sunshine wrap, Seoul Bowl and Alkaline salad."}
{"text":"I have been always wanted to go to an organic raw food restaurant. Moment was right when we celebrated our friends Bacelorette party in Live Organic Food Bar. Our table of 6 was the only table busy at 1 PM. Later few other tables become occupied.

Nice server came to take our order of drinks and later delivered water for those who didn't have anything. We got to try our friends smoothies and teas, which tasted fresh, energizing and smooth.

Menu was short and sweet. Something for big hunger and a small snack. I felt hungry and went for the TRAINERS BOWL. I think I made the best choice, as I had plenty of food, it tasted so good and it lasted for long. It had fresh salad, tempura, tofu, sweet potatoes, chickpeas, beans, quinoa and something which I am probably forgetting. It all came with a nice almond dipping sauce. It was warm and a true comfort food. I was so happy that I made the choice of this $15 bowl. I am used to much cheaper meals, and we always share, but this was totally worthy of the price. I heard that Woody Harrelson is the fan of this place and I imagined him enjoying this :))

If you are thinking of sunshine wrap, then be aware that this is not half as filling as any of the hot bowls. It is good, but not enough food to kill the hunger. It looks good and tastes again fresh, smooth and energizing.

Of course a nice meal ends with a nice dessert. We found varieties of different mock Nanaimo bars. Original is my favourite, at Raw we could choose from three different kinds. We had strawberry and mint bars. Mind that the strawberry one is much sweeter and nicer than mint one. I definitely was missing stevia or maple syrup or whatever they are using to sweeten their pastry....but I kept in mind that this was the healthiest bar I have ever eaten :)

There are not many places where to enjoy raw food in Toronto. After being to Live Organic Food bar, I can definitey recommend this. This is a lovely spot and the food takes care of your body. Peace, love, happiness...and Live Organic Food Bar :)"}
{"text":"I'm definitely more of a fan of their cooked food menu rather than the raw side. And I do eat it 2/3 meals raw in a day. I just find that a lot of these gourmet raw food places offer foods that claim to have superfoods and nuts and oils like crazy which make it so high fat and does not satisfy your hunger. Then when you order a salad as an entree it's not even enough greens and veggies to be even considered a meal (especially if your used to eating raw vegan salads that are huge because you know it's important to get a lot of carbohydrate calories as opposed to ones from fats). 
I usually opt for their cooked menu."}
{"text":"I'll try to keep my rant short and to the point.

Who went: 3 friends who haven't seen each other in a while (2 pescatarians/1 carnivore)
Atmosphere: cold, borderline freezing (I don't think they have heating)

Ordered: 
Chickpea Flour/Cornmeal French Fries (tasted horrible, the \"mayo\" dip at Fresh is MUCH better)
Potato Corn Chowder (the taste was decent at best - but - what's the point of calling it chowder when the consistency was NOT of a chowder)
Detox Salad (came with kelp noodles and an abundance of seaweed - it was one of the worst tastes I've ever experienced)
Some sort of pasta primevera dish with olives and other veggies (tasted bland)
Some sort of almond-y loose leaf tea (was awesome!)
Strawberry-Lime Daiquiri (really had a bad aftertaste to it)

Honestly, I think people live in denial when they highly rate this place. Yes - I feel places that try to serve sustainable, ethical food should be supported. BUT this place has horrible tasting food with ridiculous prices. 

Now onto the service...
I ordered the detox salad ($12) and I spit out the first bite I had. It was disgusting to me - a combination of the smell of the zoo and grass - all in my mouth.
I informed the waitress of the situation and asked to order something off the menu. She told me her manager doesn't allow that but offered to give me 10% off another dish I ordered. I told her that was unacceptable and have never heard of such service at a restaurant (I've done this only twice in my life at a restaurant with no problems, and another time I chose not to say anything but the waiter saw I didn't touch my meal and took it off the bill). She said sorry but its her manager's policy and I couldn't speak to the manager because she wasn't there. She went to talk to another waitress and offered me a FREE dessert. This made no sense...why can't they just make me another meal - their desserts aren't cheap anyways. I said no to that and asked her to take away my plate. My friend shared her EXPENSIVE pasta dish but we both agreed it was rather bland. 
When we got the bill the waitress had taken 30% off my salad. That was nice...but I felt I was getting lied to. First she only offered 10% off a new meal, then she offered a dessert....just poor customer service. I don't blame her - I blame management.

Anyways, my friends and I won't be back - poor service, high costs, and mediocre food at best.

Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Live. We checked out the menu prior to our dinner experience and were really excited at the plethora of options. The space itself is quite lovely, and we were able to grab the spot at the windows at the front, which initially seemed like a great place to sit....but as the place filled up, the line of other diners waiting to be seated hovered right around our table.

The Space
I quite like the space itself, it was warm, welcoming, and not pretentious. The bathrooms were clean and di not smell of mould, which for me these days seems to be a bonus when they are located in the basement of the building
The restaurant however is not wheelchair accessible and/or barrier free.

The Food:
Had a pitcher of Sangria with Orange Juice, Blueberries, Hibiscus and Sparkling Water to start, and it was delicious!
Started with the Cesar Salad, which was also tasty..especially the croutons, and for my gluten-free friend this was such a treat, considering the bread options our there for folks living with Celiac.
The main was rather disappointing. I had the combo platter ( a sampler of \" their most popular dishes\" according to one of our 3 servers). This combo was comprised of cannelloni, a pizza topped with artichoke and arugula, a Mediterranean tart and the tostata. Honestly, the tostata was the only item on that platter I enjoyed, the rest was incredibly salty...and I usually love salt! I can't really be sure what exactly was the salty culprit, but it was curious that it was so strong in 3 of those samplers.
For sweets after our meal, I had the cheesecake and my friend the carrot cake and they were ok, nothing special. 

The service
The servers were quite friendly, but continued to want to removed plates that were not yet finished and even asked to take away our pitcher of sangria when there was still enough left. 
The place grew to be quite busy with people waiting for seating, so my sense is that the servers were quite eager to move us through... we were looking to enjoy our dinner and sangria and some conversation, so not in any rush, but there were times where I felt rushed.
Live is not cheap, and there were definitely some great moments during our experience there. I would return and try some other items on the menu before I make my final decision about this place."}
{"text":"The food is good. The  kitchen is unapologetically slow. I waited 35 minutes for food and the lovely wait staff never saw fit to offer a glass of water. What was most troubling is there is no system for how orders are processed. I met and conversed with two very nice ladies who arrived 15 minutes after me yet they received their food first. My advice is order by phone in advance. 

Also anyone allergic to nightshades needs to be careful here. The kitchen staff was genuinely unaware what is and isn't a nightshade vegetable."}
{"text":"I'm a meatatarian, I took my raw food spouse here for a surprise. However I was the one really surprised. The food was excellent!. The nachos were great. I had the chef's special of the day, brown rice with lentils and tofu on top. It was really good. The portions were large, we couldn't eat all the food. there was lots of sharing going on.

For desert, I had the pistachio Halva and shared some of the almond chocolate brownie (forget the exact name) Both were superb!

Plan on going back.

-=- update -=-
I wasn't going to mention this until I saw Antonella's review. But of the four of us that ate there, two people had the spaghetti and meatballs and the those two started feeling nauseous before finishing the meal. None threw up, but it was touch and go. 

Originally we had suspected, because of the timing that it could not have been anything we ate at Live. But....now I'm starting to think it was. Specifically the spaghetti and meatballs.

Having said that the food was great. In fact I'll probably risk going back."}
{"text":"Great food. Smug, inattentive service.  I'm a server who understands the hospitality industry, but the service ruins the experience a little.  Change the staff and it would be worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Really nice and flavourful food. Really enjoyed the burdoch pulled sandwich. 
The ambiance is good, service is quick and friendly, prices are right."}
{"text":"I have recently gone raw and decided to drag my bf to a restaurant where we both could eat. It had a nice atmosphere and the menu seemed perfect for the both of us. Our server seemed less then excited to do his job, but we got water and menus right away. I had the Soft Shell Tacos and he had the Black Bean Burrito.The menu is a little pricey but worth it not to have to do i myself. Everything arrived at a reasonable time and i enjoyed my dish, my bf was craving meat in his but all in all it was good food. I would have excused the servers attitude (sometimes we all have bad days) if another server with a similar \"better then you\" attitude didn't come to take our plates. When i asked if they had a desert menu, i was told in a very rude tone \" ahh, no.. you can go look at them over there\" as if this was common knowledge. I could have understood this rudeness if i had walked in wearing a dead cow carcass draped around my shoulders with snake skin boots, but in all seriousness they need to work on there customer service eeek!"}
{"text":"Acai bowl was amazing! So fresh, top quality ingredients, quick, and served in a convenient to go container with a lid. What more can you ask for?! Such great food at this place!"}
{"text":"COME, YOU WILL NOT REGRET. I love meat and eat it everyday - just saying. I was skeptical about trying out a place I felt couldn't fulfill my insatiable desire for protein rich food but boy was I wrong. Ordered the raw combo platter and got to sample the manicotti, pierogies, sushi and mushroom reuben. EVERY item was a hit and tasted refreshing and clean. I particularly enjoyed the tahini dressing which had a lemon zest to it. I left more than satisfied and will definitely be back for round 2!"}
{"text":"probably one of my favourite spots in the world.

vegan food that non-vegans appreciate.

so many ingredients go into each and every dish you can feel the love and nutritious goodness radiate throughout your entire body during and after each meal here.

the best is getting a bunch of plates like the kimchi fries, and the burdock burrito with a salad or two and ravaging them! OH and the chocolate avocado cake for dessert is the stuff of dreams

so much gratitude goes out to this place and the crew. thank you for supporting good health, local farmers that work their butts off, and an awesome atmosphere that makes you remember all the goodness there is to appreciate in this world."}
{"text":"Les restaurants végétariens, dans toutes leurs déclinaisons, ont la fâcheuse habitude de proposer des plats bien trop salés. C'est bien le cas de Live qui combine le chlorure de sodium en quantités industrielles avec un piètre service suintant une certaine arrogance : celle de ceux qui sont des végétariens ou végétaliens accomplis, véritables ceintures noires du déni omnivore. 

Vous ne verrez donc aucun matière animale dans ce restaurant ou dans les plats, à l'exception des chiens et caniches cachés dans des sacs à mains de clientes un tantinet extravagantes et exigeantes. 

Dans la salle, le regard hagard de ces nombreux mecs donne l'impression que leur présence en ce lieu de privation est un passage obligé pour être accepté par certaines demoiselles, adeptes de ces pratiques alimentaires intolérantes et idiotes."}
{"text":"I've been to Live! many times while living in Toronto, and now that I'm in Vancouver, I'm realizing Live! is not the kind of place to take for granted.  Yes some things on the menu are a little pricey (talking to you sweet potato fries), yet others are very reasonable (burgers, wraps, salades, etc) expecially considering the decent portion sizes.  
Very friendly people, wonderful food, great selection of raw and non-raw make this a 5* in my book (or at least yelp profile)!"}
{"text":"Raw food is a growing trend among the health-conscious and celebrities alike, and Live Food Bar is a great place to start.  Their friendly, approachable staff and their bright, open-concept space is at once welcoming and informative.  A word of advice: try the Sunshine Wrap if you really want to experience what sunshine would do to your tastebuds if it was really food."}
{"text":"Only visited the liberty village location. Great food. Good prices. But they were out of stock on items 2 times in a row."}
{"text":"People love to detox. Especially after a weekend of abusing one's liver. What better way to rejuvenate your body than by filling it up with some uber healthy, gourmet, sugar free (yes!), vegan delights? I'm in, I'm first in line, I'm snatching up a menu and perusing the meals that are made with both local and organic ingredients. Just by typing this, I can feel my body being cleansed. It must be magic. What is seriously magic about this place is the quality and freshness of everything. After all, most of the dishes are raw, which ensures that the nutrients are kept in the food and are not lost in the cooking process. 

I am drawn to anything that contains guacamole (It is in fact, my bff), so straight away, my food senses directed me to the soft shell tacos. The spiced ground walnuts are genius, and being an occasional meat eater, I definitely felt its affect as a replacement for meat. Not that it is meant in this way, but when topped with salsa, greens, my bff and wrapped in a lil corn flax tortilla, you do not feel like anything could possibly be missing. And it's not. The salads are equally filling, healthy, and interesting (ie. eggplant 'bacon' - what in the peanut factory is this?) and their mains are nothing if not appealing. However, whether you order a raw or a cooked dish, it's gonna cost you. Literally. Live is a wee bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. Fresh food, interesting options, and of course, a detox... but that's free of charge."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because I live right around the corner.  It has improved a lot over the last few years - the first time I went for dinner it was all (or almost all) raw food but now it's a 50/50 mix of raw and cooked food.  In my opinion the cooked food is much, much better.

The service can be a little slow, but nothing terrible."}
{"text":"Patio on point. Food on point. Presentation on point. Service on point. 

Thanks to my vegan friend who was visiting Toronto for the weekend, we found this little gem on DuPont. With all the construction and chaos going around this area, it was a bit hard to spot the restaurant. 

The inside looked cozy and cute, but since the weather was nice out, we sat outside on the patio. It is right beside the train track so it can get nosy at times but it's still nice!

One of my friends and I ordered the same thing - the burdock burrito. I asked for recommendations and this was one of them. Zero regret. So tasty and flavourful!!! My other friend ordered a burger (forgot which one...) and he really enjoyed it. 

Drink menu was short but that's always helpful for someone like me - most indecisive person when deciding the menu..

Looking forward to trying some other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Live Organic Food Bar is absolutely awesome. 

Vegan, vegetarian, raw food - check
Alcohol - check
Great staff - check

What I liked about this place is that the food is absolutely delicious. Fresh, tasty & good for you. 

And did I mention they serve alcohol? So unlike some \"vegan/raw/organic\" places, Live Organic Food Bar does not have a vibe of judgement or \"look at how amazing we are for being vegan.\" Nope, they don't care about that - they just want to serve you good food & have you enjoy your meal. 

The staff is great. They know their stuff are friendly & relaxed. I can't recall our servers name from my visit in mid January, but she was awesome."}
{"text":"Am I a pig or are the portions so baby small ? Mind you the sunflower wrap was to die for and I've been craving it since. The so called root chips on the side were so small and now what I expected. Pickles were super addictive though. The doors were both open making the already cold night colder. My poor friend is a tiny little thing and was shivering so I asked for the doors to be cold. I can't imagine we were the only ones ? Had a lovely green tea which was just what I wanted and friend had the burrito but as a bowl so no wrap. Delicious food but smaller portions compared to fresh restaurants. Server was kind and checked up appropriately."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and atmosphere!! We had the 7 layer dip for an appetizer and it was so fresh and delicious! I had a burrito which is filled with tofu scramble, black beans, onions and other great stuff! Wonderful and very filling. I also had a white wine Sangria which was very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best raw/live foods restaurant in Toronto.    Spoken from a US Southern-country-girl-recently-turned raw vegan.

Let me say that as a raw vegan, I love this place so much, I would move to Toronto just to eat here!  I went to Toronto for vacation in September, and I not only dined in here twice, I also ordered delivery three times!   Yes, it is a little pricey (especially if you go through orderit.ca, but trust me:  You'll stop caring after the first bite!  It is DELICIOUS!  I absolutely detest beets, but their beet burger is out of this world.   I even ordered one to eat on the plane ride home.  Their salads are hearty and savory, too!   Unlike many raw restaurants, they put a lot of food AND though into their salads.  You can actually get FULL off of a salad here.   I got addicted to the detox salad (I'm a seaweed addict) and ordered it with every meal I had there.    The big bowl salad and the alkaline salad were yummy, too.    The dill tahini dressing is so tasty that if that I'd ordered it as a drink if I could.   The desserts are delicious.   

Only complaint is that the credit machine broke on my last visit, and I had to use an ATM not from my bank to get my final-by-so-worth-it meal.  That was a HUGE inconvenience, but eating the food helped ease my pain.

Next time back in Toronto, I'll make I stay in a hotel close to this restaurant.   (:  Message to the locals:   Appreciate what you have.   We NEED this place in the states-  seriously."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. 

Tad on the expensive end, but you pay premium for fresh, healthy food which is fine by me. I got a Paleo bowl via OrderIt for lunch at work, and the staff even drew me a lion king doodle to match my OrderIt nickname haha. Can't wait to try their other items :D"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Live last night with my wife and we absolutely loved the place. Tons of variety on the menu and although most of it is raw, there are some cooked options too. I try to eat mostly raw but my wife liked a cooked item on the menu. I had the Beet burger with added guacamole and coconut bacon. It was unreal, especially the cashew based cream sauce on it. My wife had the Burdock Burrito. We also both got a Whirl Pearl tea which is Green Tea with peppermint and jasmine. Once the tea cooled down enough to drink it was awesome, great aroma and felt good finishing it after I finished my food.

Everyone working there that night was really accommodating and nice. Great energy there with the environment and the staff. Everyone at the other tables on the back patio seemed to be really enjoying themselves too. Highly recommend this place. Even if you are an omnivore or a regular vegan. Raw vegan food is shockingly tasty."}
{"text":"Great selection of vegan and raw vegan healthy and comfort foods. Had a burger and it tasted great! Loved the presentation as well! What I didn't like about this place was the customer service! Place was super busy with only one server!!! Waited a long time when I got in and wasn't even acknowledged. Had to walk all the way through the restaurant to ask to be seated and server wasn't very friendly. At the end I asked for desert menu and he said they don't have one! That's it! He could have at least recommended something or verbally list some desert options. I will not return because of this unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"So I went to this last night and it wasn't amaaaazing, but it wasn't bad. I had the \"raw platter\" I think that's what it's called. It was bascially 4 samples of the main courses for $22 which I think is way too much considering the portion size which was tiny. The platter could be a main for one person but if you were thinking \"oh this is gonna be big I'm going to share it with someone else\" yeah no, both of you would only get a bite of each minus the greens. The platter consists of \"manicotti\" (surprisingly great pasta, but didn't like the red pepper sauce that much), \"pizza\" (looks nothing like pizza and the red pepper sauce does not go well with the crust which is really good cause it's made with some sort of nut, I forgot which. The \"cheese\" made of cashews is really good), \"kebab\" (the kebab part is really hard and just not good at all but the other greens that are with it are pretty good. Check the menu, it lists everything), & \"samosas\" (I love samosas that come from The Samosa Factory which, to me, do not taste \"indian\" but this samosa is terrible omg. It is filled with black pepper and that's the only thing you taste. Also disliked the greens with the sauce that comes with it. This one's a no no). I believe you would be able to switch out the 4 and have different ones? Not sure. Anyways, I wanted to try more so I ordered the \"soft shell taco\" and tbh, it was quite good but a little bit too much for me as in too stuffed. The sundried carrots were amazing! I wish they added more of those as there was only 4. My friend ordered the \"quinoa-black bean burger\" and he couldn't finish it because it was too spicy for him. I tried it and it was too spicy for me as well so if you don't like that then I wouldn't recommend it. Also, the burger was waaaay too soft. It felt weird in the mouth but anyways that's all I tried. Hope this helped."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and i have not been that impressed I've been to other raw vegan restraunts like Rawilicious which I love, but this place was not so good the place is way to pricy for what your getting. I after got a strawberry smoothie and a green juice and they both tasted watered down but the strawberry smoothie was okay.. i WOULD get it again though. The place is a little to pricy and I will not be coming here so frequently I'd rather make raw food at home, while I was there I didn't even bother to get any dessert because first I remembered I had made the same exact thing at home and second it did not look as appetizing (not fresh) and all the desserts looked exactly the same they looked as if they all contained coaca powder and nuts (not much variety). overall I did not like the place as much as Rawilicious but the atmosphere is nice so are the bathrooms lol :) but the resteraunt is a little too small and not that open you practically have to shove yourself against the wall to let someone get past you lol."}
{"text":"This place lit me on fire to go raw vegan for quite a few months. Their cuisine blew my mind, and the smoothies and juices were delicious. Definitely a good spot for raw vegan or just vegan eats if you're ever in the area."}

Will definitely be back for more."}

Food
sushi maki- 2/5  nothing like sushi
black bean burrito- 3/5

{"text":"Another vegan exploration adventure! I have been here twice already and have enjoyed my experience both times!

It's a small place tucked away beside some other shops but they have decent amount of seating. Both times I went, it was not too busy with maybe approximately 2-3 tables being served. They also have patio seating but I have yet to sit out there.

The first time I came here, I ate in and ordered The Detox Salad. It tasted awesomely refreshing, citrus-ey/lemon-ey, crunchy (in a good way) and filling! The avocado really helped neutralize your palate whenever the lemon-ey tang was becoming a bit too strong for your tongue to handle. At least that was the case for me...regardless I still loved it and would order it again! The wakame also was a plus because I just love it ever since I discovered it! For those of you who may not know, wakame is the better version of the seaweed salad you get at most sushi restaurants. I think it is similar to, if not, kelp?

The second time I came here, I ordered take out and had the Big Bowl Salad. It was just as amazing as the last and everything tasted great! Fresh ingredients it seems like for both times too! It was not as filling but regardless I still devoured it quite happily!

On both visits, I was greeted by a friendly waiter/waitress and the wait time for food was not long! I'm really happy to have discovered yet another cool yummy organic vegan restaurant. I honestly thought vegan food would not taste the greatest but I have been proven otherwise! I would definitely recommend this place to ANYONE! Vegan or not try it out!"}
{"text":"i'll keep this brief. i ordered the blue fusion smoothie and the raw platter which comes with the daily dish, lasagne, pizza, thai spring rolls and a heaping mound of salad in the middle (with my choice of creamy ginger dressing). tasty it was but it felt like i was just eating a giant plate of salad. i'm a vegetarian but i feel a bit cheated. at $18 for the platter, i would prefer a little more oomph than rabbit food."}
{"text":"Very cute place...friendly quick service. Some things were great (quinoa bowl, pizza and tacos) some were gross (don't even know what they were...came on the 4 item sampler plate)

Urban herbivore has similar food...but infinitely more tasty."}
{"text":"The space is rather tight and the food smell sort of overpowers the ambiance. I had read reviews about the lack of service but we were greeted perfectly (we're generally treated as second class citizens with the toddler and stroller). The space was of course filled with over-aggressive-raw-lifestyle-judge-everyone-that-eats-meat sort of stereotypes, but of course we won't hold that against them.
What I will find them accountable for however, is their food. Too bean based! Too much cumin! Cumin should not be handed over to people that do not know how it is culturally used. Cumin is an extremely powerful spice and when used in the middle east (this coming from a middle eastern), the tip of a tea spoon is used as measure (that's how small an amount one has to use to spice up the food). I felt a kilo of cumin was in my food. What was kind of worse was, I believe it was to cover up the bean/lentil based burger patty that had started to go a little bad.
I hope the next time we're in (we're the type of people that gives businesses many chances), we can try something that reflects what they do a little better."}
{"text":"A nice try but I have to say that foods here are just not the my cup of tea. 
...And received an astonishingly high final check."}
{"text":"Please note: I am NOT a vegan (I'm Italian... If I love it here, so will you); I brag about this location and their items to everyone. 

Their Liberty Village location is great for pick- up/ lunch/ or a guilt-free meal between meetings. 

The Dupont location is sweet, delicious, clean, and always welcoming. 
Live has consistently offered delicious food that is *filling* and beneficial. Water is served promptly in rustic mason jars, with fresh cut flowers on each table. 
They offer an outdoor patio around the side/ back in the summer that is darling come summer. It's humbling to enjoy cruciferous greens amongst a live garden just steps from the hustle & bustle of Dupont and Spadina. Live is a peaceful escape for your gut flora ;) 

This is a great place to meet friends, a casual date, or catch up on a good read. 

Vegan desserts at the front are a must-try!! Who knew avocado could taste like chocolate mousse? 

My Favourite Dishes Are: Alkaline salad (add tempeh), Sunshine Wrap"}
{"text":"Whoa. Went here yesterday with a friend of mine and was super impressed. For one, the menu has changed since I went last and is all gluten free. Most of the menu is soy free, and this is indicated next to each item. I ordered the pizza to split with my friend (doesn't look like a pizza), which tasted fantastic. I also ordered the black bean burrito (a classic). My friend ordered the soft taco, which I taste tested, and was not disappointed. We ordered the cheesecake to split, which really put the icing on the cake. It was out of this world. It was creamy, decadent, but not too rich. I also ordered the blue fusion (I believe that's what it was called) smoothie, which was really good, but had a touch too much vanilla, but that didn't ruin it. The service has improved as well now - wasn't slow at all. Looking forward to going next time."}
{"text":"Waitress and waiter seemed very annoyed by our presence, were unaware of needs, such as which drinks we were going to have or even the smallest request we would have to wait for them to notice and fullfil it.
Food is ok but definitely does not justify choosing this place."}
{"text":"After having eaten a bunch of \"junk\" vegan food I was really excited to eat here. I was not disappointed at all. The place is really clean, bright, and comfortable. I had the three sisters bowl and it was delicious. The kale was massaged and warm, the sweet potatoes were super flavorful, and the corn salsa with avocado were a nice fresh cold topping. I had it with a tahini dressing instead. My boyfriend had he huevos rancheros which were really good also. We shared a blue fusion smoothie with almond milk which was delicious as well. The meal was extremely satisfying and didn't leave me feeling weighed down like the vegan junk food I'd been eating that past weekend. Definitely recommend and I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, its so tasty and vibrant and makes me feel good after. I find that some days it's a little better than others in terms of service and presentation. Last time we ate here, two things that usually come with the Italian platter weren't there and we weren't told. I usually wouldn't mind, but its a $20 appetiser! Still, it was super tasty and fresh. My favs being the Italian and Nacho platters, Kale Caesar Salad, Sweet Potato Stir-fry and all the unique raw deserts! The raw tiramisu is too good."}
{"text":"Super lovely patio around back! Helpful servers directed us to the most popular food items. Raw Nachos and cannelloni were amazing! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.

I've been twice, and loved it both times. It's pricey, but it's so worth it. I've tried the Alkaline, the raw platter, the butterscotch smoothie, and the raw vegan poutine. They were all amazing. The butterscotch smoothie was the best smoothie I've ever had! The poutine was yummy, the alkaline was the best damn salad I've ever had at a restaurant, and the raw platter was PERFECT. They've got my business."}
{"text":"Great for vegan/healthy eaters. I ordered the chocolate smoothie to start with a splash of oil of oregano (I'm currently fighting a cold) bad idea, it made the whole smoothie taste of oregano. My boyfriend ordered the blueberry/strawberry smoothie no add-ons, delicious! Just made a mistake on the potency of the oil. For an appetizer we got sweet potato hush puppies. So good and filling. For dinner I got the Alkaline salad, it was so good. So many interesting flavors mixed together, dressing was a little strong but delicious. My boyfriend got the broccoli tofu teriyaki, it was really great, maybe could have used a bit more sauce, but so yummy. Get it with quinoa, it adds an interesting, unique flavor. Great restaurant if you are feeling adventurous!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has take out and dine in options with a lovely and opened seating area. The staff are friendly and prices are fair. I had the detox salad which was awesome, but you'll definitely need to eat something else with it since it wasn't very filling. I also had a kombucha, which was quite pricey. I usually get the same bottle for half the price at other places."}
{"text":"Love the quaint outdoor patio in the back.....very comfortable and doesn't feel cramped.

The service is friendly and relaxed, and even on a Saturday night they servers aren't trying to push you out after you've finished your meal. Over all the ambience is chill and inviting. 

The food is creative and adventurous. I've tried a few raw dishes here and may try something cooked next time. I do want to rave about the desserts. They are delicious and very satisfying. I had some sort of lemon cheesecake-esque dessert and it was to die for.....it was also filling : ) 

The 'by the glass' wines are excellent.

It's pricey but worth it for the quality and creativity."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and the food. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but occasionally would love to have a cleanse. The brunch was yummy and filling. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Overall it was a good experience, but slightly disappointing on a few things... First, the server seemed to have forgotten our first dessert order, went to do his prep work instead soon after. Only til us reminding him again 15 minutes later, the orders came. I know people said expect slow service from this place, but if we are spending ~$200 for the food, I would hope the service to be at least good and efficient, if not excellent.

Second the portion for the juice order was a bit shy for the price. Even 'Fresh' has its double portion for similar pricing. 

Food was great and exotic, tasty! No complains there. So perhaps being a bit more proactive asking for server's attention, this is a great place for a meal that's good for the body and soul."}
{"text":"I know it's called \"Live\" and the food is home grown, but salad should always be soaked in salt water before serving otherwise you will find lots of interesting insects.  I, unfortunately found a live baby worm in my meal, and it completely threw me off. The place is clean, and the ambiance lovely, but I just can't go back. :("}
{"text":"The good - great ambiance, relaxed feel. The \"Lychee Flurtini\" was very tasty, as well as the \"Trainer's Bowl\".  The bad - a bland \"Starter Poutine\" and mediocre \"Starter Sweet Potato\" fries. As well, I didn't feel \"sick\" right after, but my friend felt sick as she finished eating.  MOST disappointing was the lack of timely service during a dinner rush. We finally got our own water after waiting for 15 minutes after we were seated, and watched two couples who came in after us get served their meals while still waiting for our cocktails. Our indifferent and inhospitable female server seemed unconcerned about the whole affair.  Message me for pics."}
{"text":"The food is brilliant, seating space is quaint and service is friendly. The hot chocolate was just sweet enough to not taste the cocoa. The ingredients felt fresh and I loved how the food was plated. The food fills you up and is very filling. I would definitely visit again the next time I m in Toronto."}
{"text":"I never knew vegan food could be so damn good! With only fruits and vegetables, they manage to make their desserts taste like key lime pie, tiramisu, mint chocolate cups...unbelievable!!! highly highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is amazing and well priced for the quality and quantity you get. I love the big jars of water they bring you when you sit down. Service is excellent and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Nice to have an 'almost' raw place with so many options.  Had the kale salad and guacamole with gf bread.  Bun was good, guac... well I've made better, however, the Kale salad... super good!  Really good.  Finished my meal with the carrot cake which was so rich, definitely made for two, but very satisfying. I left there feeling light and satisfied... definitely returning."}
{"text":"I ate at Live a month or so ago and was really impressed with the food and service offered at this little place on Dupont.

My friends and I shared a pitcher of red wine sangria. The sangria was loaded with deliciously fresh fruit. It was surprisingly strong too - usually, I find places just pour more juice than alcohol into sangria so I was pleasantly surprised when I sipped my sangria that I was able to taste the alcohol bouncing off some yummy juices.

I then ate the vegetarian stir-fry with tofu and quinoa. It was simply superb! A ton of veggies, nicely cooked (and firm) tofu, and a rich sauce on top. I'd order it again!

I'll hopefully be returning to Live soon :)"}
{"text":"I came here to get take out and it's been a place I've been meaning to try out for a long time. 

Mostly vegetarian here, except you'll find some eggs on their brunch menu.

The food selection is really good, and I love the space and friendly people, except the food is really expensive! My Kale Salad was $11, and it was an okay portion, but that was one of the cheaper things on the menu.

It's just that I can' justify paying for something I can make at home with ingredients from bulk barn and the grocery store!

Great for a quick meal, if you're willing to splurge a little."}
{"text":"Live Organic Food Bar was on my to-do list for years. Actual years. I used to live in the area and pass by it regularly but for some reason it just never happened for me and that was silly. Now, I understand they did go through a makeover and overhaul their menu at some point too. Something about faux grass previously?

Live offers a great raw and cooked vegan menu. And it's a really nice dining space, with a large patio in the back. I regularly come here for dates or bring my family, when I want to make them have a healthy meal. 

I'm especially fond of their brunch. The waffles are really delicious! I also really like some of their raw dishes like the layered dip that has ground nuts, guacamole and salsa. I *highly* recommend trying anything that has guacamole in it here. It is heavenly! Think about it, they specialize in raw foods and guacamole is raw by default. Not a raw recreation of something else.

They have a large selection of smoothies and juices that each include at least one ingredient you've never heard of or definitely don't have at home. They're licensed, which is really nice because it allows you to satisfy the health nuts and those looking for a classy evening meal all at once.

Do not skip dessert! If they have it, get either get the raw Jos Louis or the ice cream sundae. The sundae is rich and decadent as it melts a bit and the Jos Louis is really nice for sharing."}
{"text":"As someone who normally eats meat, i was a bit hesitant to try a vegan restaurant, given my experiences with vegan food not always being the best. However, being optimistic (and due it being for a friends birthday dinner so i had no actual say in the matter) i went along and was presently surprised. To start off, the environment itself was very welcoming and while the restaurant generally speaking was a tad small, it still managed to remain charming and cozy. The time between ordering our food/drinks and receiving them was normal so no issues there. It took us a little bit of time to order, not because of anything bad, but because there were just so many options to choose from. I ended up going with the sweet potato noodle stir fry and was not disappointed. The food was warm upon placement and not only tasted delicious, but was heavily portioned. Normally i would assume vegan food to not have such large and filling portions, but i honestly felt full from the food. Not to mention, the fact that the food as mentioned in the restaurant's name, is organic. For once i felt full but not sick at the same time, which i think was due to the freshness of the ingredients. After we had our main part of the meal, we ordered dessert, which you are able to go to the front (not too far as our table was situated right near the entrance) and see for yourself before ordering. I actually cannot remember exactly what i ordered nor could i find it on their online menu, as i believe the desserts change and are made fresh daily. What i do remember is that it was a very good coconut chocolate dessert. I also noticed each different dessert had its own uniquely designed plate, which was a cool little touch. Great food, cozy atmosphere, and friendly staff, i have no complaints!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant in the specialty line of raw foods - veggies, nuts, fruits, grains and seeds.  On the expensive side, but always a healthy meal and always feel great after eating there.  They do not have a ton of seating so you may have to wait from time to time.  Also be aware if you are sitting outside that they back onto a busy freight line with a fair number of trains passing back and forth.  It is a very short walk to Dupont subway station and a reasonable walk up to Casa Loma."}
{"text":"Such a great place! My fave is the black bean burrito...I can taste it vicariously now...wish I had one right here!! Oh, and the chocolate almost fudge is outta here his world! As are the cheesy kale chips...thank god the Big Carrot sells them too!"}
{"text":"consistently great food withbawesome portions.  who ever thought a salad could be fulling? well thats why this place is amazing becsuse u feel full of goodness and couldnt ask for more.  incredibly satifying no matter how many times ive been here.  the big bowl is delicious."}
{"text":"If you thought you ate healthy, you have not until you've eaten here. Preread the menu on the way there because I spent a good 15 minute going through the menu and reading the ingredients. I didn't even know what some of the ingredients were. You have to be really open to try new things here cuz they have some incredible stuff that you can't find else where. 

This restaurant is right across from DuPont station which makes it very accessible. The decoration were simple and modern. Not as hipster as I thought it would be and it had bright lighting which is good So you can admire their work of art! 

The servers were cool and extremely helpful with explaining the menu and ingredients."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a cozy, wholesome vibe and performs wonders with unprocessed food.   Like many raw-food restaurants, Live is great for those who cannot eat gluten. I enjoyed a chocolate-coconut cupcake (the coconut somehow tasted like cream cheese or maybe my mind was playing tricks on me) and a slice of almond-crusted cake that was nicely sweetened (not saccharine).  I also bought some cinnamon-raisin, gluten-free \"bagels\" to go, which, although tough to chew, were tasty. An additional plus: Live is close to the subway."}
{"text":"I never thought it'd be possible: delicious, filling raw food!  I've tried raw food before, at events throughout the city, but this has been the best raw meal I've had by 
far.  Moreover, they understand that not everyone is into raw, so they have some cooked options too!

I came here with a group of 4 and we all tried different things.  My wife and I both stuck raw.  I had the tostadas and she had the pizza.  Both were excellent!  The tostadas sat on a crisp base and was topped with corn, gauc, ground walnuts.  The pizza was made with a walnut crust, topped with herb pesto, arugula, artichokes, mushrooms, cashew chevre.  These aren't replicas of their cooked compadres.  The pizza doesn't tasty like pizza, but the flavours and textures they accomplish make them excellent dishes on their own.  

Oh, a couple added bonuses:
-The chocolate-avocado pie is absolutely decadent.  
-Our friend ordered a glass of wine and it was enormous...may be the largest pour I've ever seen at very reasonable prices
-decor and service were wonderful.  It has a great hip and relaxing vibe, as well as a patio, which we avoid due to heatwave of a summer we're having

Truthfully, I'm not sure the meals was actually that healthy, but I can at least try to convince myself that it is."}
{"text":"I had the \"crabcakes\" back in August (and as it has not reappeared on the menu so far, I'm guessing this dish is one of their seasonal entrees or something) which were absolutely delicious/fragrant and perfect. It tasted just as good as real crabcakes and was a filling, hearty meal. Everything was perfectly spiced and the sauce was lovely. The vegetarian crabcakes even tasted a bit like the real thing and were positively delicious. 
It was made as I ordered it so the food really is fresh from the kitchen.

I also tried their raw kale chips that they also sell at Whole Foods. I can't speak for the other flavors but the sour cream one was just......bloody ghastly. It tasted like a combination of sweat and someone's ass crack (or as I imagine those things would taste). Really, don't try it. Maybe the other flavors but definitely not the sour cream."}
{"text":"The best vegan restaurant I've been on my entire life. 
Excellent service and presentation.
Try the tiramisu for desert"}
{"text":"I got the three sisters curry and it was amazing .You could taste all the flavors and not to mention it was healthy as well and a beautiful scenery of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a bit bias because I'm slightly obsessed with raw food right now, but I had brunch at Live last week and thought it was fantastic. 

I love food that is an adventure, and that's exactly what Live provides. An amazing culinary adventure in innovation, wonderful fresh ingredients, and feel-good nutritious dining. 

I especially appreciate how much love and care goes in to this kind of food.

I had the raw french toast and loved it, and all of the meals at my table looked equally exciting. I can't wait to go back there. The regular menu looks great too, but it's the brunch and the desserts that I think are the real winners. 

If you've never tried raw desserts, you absolutely MUST. They're life changing, I swear. :-)"}
{"text":"Venturing in vegetarianism this past month, I was really excited when my friend recommended this raw bar around the corner from her house.

Listen, if you roll your eyes at the pale looking, yoga practicing zen people in your life who tell you about all things organic, then come here and show off to them, though why would you want to.

Anyway, I shared a sushi roll, which was sans fish, my friend had tostadas and I had red pepper \"crab cakes\". Everything we ate was well seasoned, tasted earthy and came beautifully prepped. I suspect the meals were high in fat and carbs, so don't fool yourself, raw doesn't mean diet! But nonetheless I loved what I ate and would come again.

My beef with the place, oh relax I said beef, was the fact that the waitress was slow, yes its a weekday and I'm off, but if this was my lunch hour then I'd probably lose my mind, regardless if I came from yoga or not, patience has it's limits. To think we were one of 6 customers, how do they keep up on weekends?

Anyway, if you wanna feel good about the grainy, organic lunch you had, then this is your place.

Drinks looked good and I hear they have a good brunch as well."}
{"text":"Nachos and chips were outstanding! A wonderful variety of desserts!
Service became slow because they could have used one more server when the place for completely slammed at 12:30 on a Saturday!
Friendly people and a wonderful variety of juice blends that will satisfy anyone serious about fresh juice!"}
{"text":"I love this place, where eating healthy it's not boring or limited. Great service!! 
 If you are at home and you are feeling lazy (like us last week) you can get delivery!! From orderit"}
{"text":"The food was good. My boyfriend loved his sandwich. Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction with mine. The sandwich that I had it calls  something Korean, I honestly did not like the taste so I ate in parts from what I liked to don't."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The food is of exceptional quality, delicious, healthy and creatively composed. 

I had a small bowl of the carrot ginger soup, small alkaline salad, cucumber Collins and mocha nanaimo bar. It was all so tasty, and served in a friendly and timely manner. It was a perfect meal. 

As a vegan it was such a delight to look at a whole menu and know I could order whatever I want! The setting is cute and lowkey, but very bright, clean and inviting. 

Full meal with alcoholic bevvy (2 oz by the way!) came to under 30 dollars before tip. Excellent value. This place is going to be on my regular rotation of restaurants for sure."}
{"text":"First time visit.
I started with a kale juice with other amazing great ingredients. My partner had the 100 mystery tea which he said rocked.
Our entrees were the trainer bowl and burrito. Oh my Devine, every bite was wonderful."}
{"text":"I was very pleased to hear of raw food restaurants in Toronto. I picked this one because it had partnered with orderit.ca to deliver to my hotel. It was a bit of a pain to get to the area of town the restaurant is in, so I got delivery to my hotel near the CN tower. I had the pizza and a green juice. Yum! The food was good raw food and I should know having tasted raw food from restaurants in Seattle (there are 2 mediocre to bad ones), NYC, and San Francisco."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find a vegan resto that doesn't serve junk food. There's no Yves® Ground Round used here for taco 'meat', but seeds instead. The food is delicious and higher in veg than many other places that load up on corn, corn tortillas and other fillers. I've had almost everything on the menu and highly recommend the Burdock Burrito. It has a gluten-free wrapping that's not as clean as their LIVE® wraps, and it is fried, but if you can manage that, it's very tasty. The tacos are also a great choice.

To get 5 stars, I'd take nutritional test, gluten, rice and fried offerings off the table and replace Tamari with coconut amino acids."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto last summer and I was quite nervous to try this place.  I'm a vegetarian and have several vegan friends and have often ended up liking vegan places but a raw place?  I had my doubts.  Anyway, I was so wrong.  We ate outside as it was a nice day in August.  I feel like I had a Ruben but I can't find it on their website, it's very possible they've changed the menu.  Anyway, this was the best food I had in Toronto and there is a lot of good food in Toronto."}
{"text":"We were here today, and it was delish!
We had brunch/lunch - the burrito (cooked) was ordered, the tacos, and the sunshine wrap.  All were delicious (I've also had the rainbow salad before which I also enjoy).  Their deserts are to die for!  The chocolate dream was great, and we also had the chocolate mousse - double yum.  I think this is the best raw food/vegan resto in the city!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to too many organic vegan restaurants, but I do like vegan for the most part, I don't mind raw and I certainly LOVE organic food.

I was a bit disappointed because it was highly recommended by a friend of mine.

Juices are great. Very tasty, and I love the selection of drinks, gluten-free beer, saketinis, martinis, shakes, etc. I would try more the next time around.

Detox salad, very disappointed. It looks better than it tastes. It was TOO salty. The natural sweetness of the seaweed is lost.

Curry Noodle, spicy and earthy tasting. It's either you like it or you didn't. It felt like it had too many peas, not enough noodles. 

BBQ Tofu Burger, flavour is there but the tofu was too dry.

Ravioli, it was probably my favourite dish of the evening.

Perhaps I didn't order their better dishes... but I would certainly drop by for a drink or two if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Live Organic Food Bar continues the tradition of offering healthy food; they have gluten free, sugar free, and vegan dishes.  The location is on the small side and not accessible.  If you can't deal with a small, packed place, Live may not be for you.

I'm a big fan of the raw, vegan, organic food trend. However, when frequenting these restaurants, I ran into a few problems such as huge portions and ridiculous prices.What I find unique about Live compared to the other healthy, vegan places is that they offer a lot of smaller options.  I can't eat a lot, so being able to have a meal that I don't waste or have to take to go is really nice. 

In terms of the menu, the selection is fun.  The average meal price is $15.  The menu is comprised mostly of the typical staples of the vegan/raw places such as salad bowls, wraps, burritos, burgers, rice bowls, quinoa bowls and smoothies.  

I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Spending a lot of my time in California and New York, I'm spoiled by all of the vegetarian and vegan restaurants, so it's nice when I find a vegan restaurant in Toronto that actually contains edible food. 

I've been to this place on numerous occasions, my favorite salad is the kale Caesar which I always order with extra \"bacon.\" (The dill tahini goes great with this too) 

Their tacos are also pretty good and if you go on a weekend the hue is bruncheros are delicious. Ditto for the French toast. 

The portions aren't too large which I guess some people like but if you're a glutton like me you'll wish they were a little larger. You can usually find street parking but sometimes you'll need to circle the block a few times to get it. The servers are sweet and all in all it's a pretty solid vegan option."}
{"text":"Had a great appetizer to start and had this amazing wrap. I felt so energized and happy to see so many vegetarian and vegan options available. Friendly staff as well and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"a horrible deep fried mess
Keep in mind my first review was removed...

Considering it is a \"Live Organic\" restaurant you think they would stress which items were deep fried on the menu.

I had the kale caesar salad... the \"croutons\" were hard as rocks and the salad was so dissapointing."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by my first visit, which was around 6pm on a Friday night. When my friend and I walked in we waited at the front for 5 minutes with no one to seat us. Eventually we walked into the restaurant towards the kitchen to find the waiter. It seemed like there was only 1 waiter for awhile, but later in the night another joined. I ordered the Caribbean Bowl with rice and it was okay. I did not like the sauce that came with it as it did not taste fresh, and it was too sour for my taste. My friend ordered the pad thai, which was extremely disappointing. She said it was extremely sour and tasted like glass noodles in vinegar. We shared the kimchi taro fries appetizer which I thought was the best dish of the night and was very tasty. My friend however thought that the kimchi combination with taro fries and \"nacho\" cheese was kind of weird."}
{"text":"This isn't something I'd ever prepare for myself as it takes so long. We couldn't believe how tasty and flavourful the food was. Amazing. We had the Paleo Bowl and the Black Bean Burritos. Highly recommend. Except the desserts. We got nanaimo bars in strawberry and coffee flavour and I thought they were pretty bad. No balance of flavours, unlike the rest of the meal. The rest of the meal was incredible. Will definitely be back. Won't order the nanaimo bars again, however!."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, bf and I went out for dinner and ended up at the patio at Live Organic Food Bar.  We decided to have an all raw dinner since we've never had one. Since we are completely new to the whole raw food scene, we decided to get the raw combo and a miso burger to share. I also got a \"In the Pink\" juice that has apple, pear, beet, ginger and lemon as I try to order juice that includes fruits and veggies that I don't eat often (apple & beets) so this was the perfect choice and it was really good!

The raw combo had a bit of all the mains and that inclues \"Steak and Potatoes,\" \"Spaghetti and Neatballs,\" \"Pizza M'on,\" the special of the day which was \"Pad Thai\" noodles and a salad (we had it with agave mustard dressing.) 

So what makes it raw? well, nothing was cooked! The \"Steak and Potatoes\" are actually marinated portobello mushrooms with almond/cashew puree. \"Spaghetti and Neatballs\" are zuchinni spaghetti with red pepper/tomato sauce. The pizza is a dehydrated buckwheat cracker-like crust topped with a pumpkin puree, red pepper and onion. And the \"Pad Thai\" was the zuchinni spaghetti again with a cashew/sesame sauce topped with mango. My fav was definitely the \"Spaghetti and Neatballs.\"

After dinner, we ordered 2 small desserts to share since we just HAD to try something. I wanted to get the chocolate/avocado pie but it was sold out. We chose the almond dream bar and hazelnut chocolate cup. We definitely liked the almond dream bar more...it was SO good.

Even though the idea of raw food is slightly intimidating, we were really glad we tried it. It was the perfect summer night dinner and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Now the problem of having a memory about a particular place is it has to live up to the experience. When it doesn`t , girl! There is a problem.

The first time around I had two really tasty things: a pesto pasta and a strawberry cheesecake. Both unavailable at the time.

I`m no vegetarian. Nope. I enjoy me some meat. I can`t quite deny that so when I knew I was coming here again,I checked out their menu available online.  I had the hardest time picking particularly because much of the food is raw. When I go out for dinner I like my entrees warm.

My partner is a vegetarian and suffers from celiac disease. A tough combo for finding satisfying and safe food to eat.  It`s always a dangerous affair but all of that is taken care of by asking a server to clarify what is and isn`t safe to eat.  The dining experience for her was wonderful - the kale salad and brown rise fusilli were spot on and filling.  She made great work of the chocolate raspberry dessert, too! Two thumbs up!

For me, I was still hungry and felt after eating my meal just unfulfilled. I ended up getting some chicken elsewhere.

So....yes, I will agree this place is a healthy alternative for those seeking a raw diet or those with specific dietary needs. However, be wary my meat eating friends."}
{"text":"Had a date here last Saturday night with my boyfriend. We had a \"very nice time\", but sadly the food was not a huge standout. 

We ordered: Sweet potato fries ($10!) with  BBQ sauce...these were tasty and plentiful (more like rounds) 

Detox Salad: this was the low part of the meal. It looked BEAUTIFUL. But I couldn't eat it. This is very rare for me! The seaweed was too salty and too chewy...totally overwhelming the delicate kelp noodles and avocado. Sad :(

The tasting plate was interesting. It is a taste of 4 of the entrees. It was tasty, but I had no idea what I was eating other than the Thai zucchini noodles (bland). It would be helpful if the server pointed out which was which. 

Dessert- avocado chocolate cake thing- lovely- rich and creamy

Cocktails- Delicious! And don't shy away from the booze! 

Atmosphere: cozy and relaxed. I liked it. 

Service: totally fine 

I would come back here and try some different things. Again, once the favourites are discovered, I'm sure this place is stellar."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's always a great place when you want some clean food,  especially when you've just visited the holistic clinics next door.  They have a selection of food to go too,  as they have a brand of products as well.  Also,  they carry other products from Matcha,  to desserts.  

Convenient to the subway, as it's across from DuPont station,  and it's licensed.  Summertime they have a nice patio as well.  I enjoy their bowls,  and dips.  A lot of work goes into the food,  and it's qaulity organic food,  so the price points do reflect that.  So,  be prepared for that at the end, but overall dining experience, I would do it again.

Friendly, knowledgeable staff was helpful with food choices.  Just wished they can fix the front,  as steps are uneven/tripping hazard,  and there's low visibility at night there. So,  sometimes I don't know when they are open."}
{"text":"I am not vegan but this place rocks. I would eat here every day. Loved the mushroom bigger and pad Thai. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Fabulously healthy vegan good in the Annex and conveniently close to Dupont station. I had a Rejuvenation Bowl which was delicious. It is a little on the pricey side at $15 but I struggled to finish it so it is essentially two meals. The juice is also good.

The restaurant is smallish and fairly relaxed, so are the staff so you don't feel very rushed. I'd like to try the chickpea fries next time as I hear they are highly regarded."}
{"text":"I feel conflicted upon writing this review.  Why?  Because a delicious meal at Live, two out of three of us immediately fell ill and one of us threw up three times.  Right outside, on Dupont St.  And then once more a half hour later.  What gives?

First of all, the friend who repeatedly threw up started with an amazing Kale soup, which I tasted.  Followed by the cold spaghetti and neat balls, which I also tasted.  We then shared an amazing slice of \"cheese cake\" and that's when it hit.  My other friend, Robert H. did not experience any sickness whatsoever.  He tried all of our food except for the dessert.  

I dry-heaved on the street (TMI?) which NEVER happens to me since I have an iron stomach.  I was actually shocked we became so ill after the meal.

I should note that every single dish that was ordered between the three of us was mind-blowing.  The service was fantastic and their patio is lovely.  The music was faint, but awesome (Bowie? Yesss) and the overall vibe was really relaxing and casual.  I would recommend this restaurant to all vegan and vegetarian friends with a caution: skip the dessert."}
{"text":"Food was great, took a while for waitress to remember to bring our food but she did compliment us with dessert. Place was small but again food was great, fresh, and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is trying waaaay too hard. It seems like all of the ingredients are fresh and healthy, but there is no flavor when they're composed together into a meal. Our group had the uber protein salad, the tacos, and the breakfast burrito (all from the brunch menu), and no one was overly impressed with anything. The prices are steep, and you're really not getting anything worth even half the price. Skip this place!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Def not the best raw vegan in the Toronto area. Food is either over-salted to the point I couldn't eat it (and I HATE wasting food), or else it's bland. Overpriced for the quality but great to see healthy options in the city."}
{"text":"I was originally going to give this place 4 stars maybe 5 but sadly I can't. I found out about this place from there takeout dishes at The Big Carrot. I had a few & really enjoyed 99% of them. To break down my views on the actually restraint..

Atmosphere- It's a smaller space for a restraint. On the main floor of an old Toronto house. Very hip, trendy, relaxed kind of a feel. Neat place for a date. Has a café sort of feel almost. 4/5 

Food- The food is pretty damn yummy! I really enjoyed all the food I've had from here. I prefer the raw dishes but the cooked ones are good as well. For the price I'd rather get something that is more unique. I adore the raw pizza. Super yummy! The prices are a little high in my opinion but you have to remember that everything is organic. I will say you might not enjoy the food if you're not use to vegan food. If you eat a typical North American diet this might be a bit to much of a shock. It's a very different menu 4.5/5 

Service- this is where it all falls apart for me. I really dislike the service here. Especially for the price of everything. I'd like attentive, helpful service with a smile. The service is unbelievably slow. Took us over half an hour to get are drinks one night! There was 12 of us but that's still utterly ridiculous! This place could be a real gem if they improved the service! 2/5

Overall I would come back on occasion. I would recommend this place but only to certain people who are more accustom to vegan food. I would warn them about the service however!"}
{"text":"This is NOT usually my fare but Nice's night out. I'm a Swiss chalet,Harvey,California sandwich, Gabardine, pizza libretto etc type of guy! Service with a smile, restaurant had a buzz, food was fresh,tasty. I recommend the burrito. So thanks to all this place deserves two thumbs up! Bill"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place because I was dying for some veggies and it was close to the metro stop. I'm so glad we stopped by. We liked it enough to return a few days later. 

The first time, I ordered the bibimbap bowl. It was not quite what I expected but it really hit the spot. I expected something more greasy and less healthy. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. I was very happy with the food. 

The second time, I was tempted to order the same dish but ended up getting the three sisters bowl. Like the first dish, it was delicious and very filling. I realized that I could probably figure out how to make this one. I preferred the first dish to the second one.

The ginger carrot soup of the day was very gingery. 

My boyfriend ordered the kimchi burger. It tasted great. It came with some homemade crackers and dip that were good, too. All in all, I'd probably order any of these three entrees again."}
{"text":"I'd just like to add that I actually dream about the food here sometimes."}
{"text":"We loved the food here! Too bad we are not from here, otherwise we would be coming for lunch every day! The stuff was super friendly and attentive as well! I just love this place! I filmed a video while we were having lunch, you can see it here http://rawismyreligion.com/gourmet-raw-day-in-toronto/

We had
ENCHILADAS
Not my fav, but good.
MEZZE PLATE
My favorite dish. I love falafel, tabbuoleh, hummus, olives and greens. The sun-dried olives were wonderful. Beyond wonderful. The regular olives were way too salty for me after not eating salt for month, I would ask for more sun-dried instead the next time. 
PIZZA
This Pizza ($16) was my hubbies' favorite dish. The crust was wonderful, the sauce and the topping too, especially the nut cheese. First I thought the big fresh tomato slices on the pizza were a little to salady on the pizza, but actually it balanced the dish perfectly. The artichokes were so great on it.
FALAFEL AND TACO WRAP
We took the 2 wraps to go to eat on the plane later that day. The falafel wrap was basically the mezzo plate wraped into a red wrap. The taco wrap was hearty and smokey, really delicious. The wrapping veggie paper itself wasn't so great after caring it around for 3 hours, the next time I'll make sure to eat the wraps right away."}
{"text":"Cute geek-chic girls eating overpriced Quinoa.

Expensive haircuts bobbing in and out of bowls of goop.

Mind numbingly expensive for what it is.

You do, in fact, win certain friends with salad."}
{"text":"Went to Live tonight and was so disappointed in our meal (especially since I had been looking forward to going for years). I had the Bacon Cheese burger because it sounded interesting and I just felt like a veggie burger but what I got was a bland, small and flavourless patty. It was suppose to be topped with all sorts of delicious toppings (eggplant bacon, sesame hemp mayo etc.) but all that I could taste was the chickpea patty (which completely fell apart after the second bit) and the bun. If there were toppings, you could hardly taste them. It was accompanied by a few soft (stale) veggie chips and a pickle (and it cost $15!). My boyfriend had the tofu and chips which came with nice tasting chickpea fries and some uninspired deep fried tofu and a bland salad ($16).

The place was quite busy, so they must be doing something right or maybe the area is just lacking in vegetarian restaurants but I wish this place could have been better. The service and decor were very nice though."}
{"text":"Live Organics had a good night and I'm turning that into 5!

First off the food was amazing. My friend enjoyed the trainers bowl which I sneaked some tastes from. The tempeh was great and I don't usually enjoy it. The mix they chose for the bowl works well.

I had the Mezze Plate. Perfect. The exact amount of tasty goodness from all angles. The raw falafels were awesome. 

We finished with a tasty oat cookie.

There are many many other great options for you to choose from. I would call this a better version of fresh.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Being a new vegan I've taken an interest in trying all the vegan friendly establishments in the city. This place is my NEW fave. It was incredible. The dining room and visible kitchen have a cool welcoming vibe. There is SO many choices on the menu I couldn't believe it. Not everything is raw. I would say maybe half of it is and half is cooked. Everything is clearly marked (nut free, gluten free, cooked, raw etc.) and they have a bunch of daily specials, and a full tasty drink menu. Everything is organic! 

Me and my dining buddy had a \"shrimp\" tempura sushi, that was so amazing I am craving it... just like I used to crave actual sushi. We shared the cooked black bean burrito and the raw special which was a coconut curry kelp noodle bowl with 2 loaded  and large cucumber almond spring rolls. This food is so gourmet and inventive. I was inspired and had my mind blown. It opened up new ideas for me in my own kitchen. AND the cashew sour cream that was served with the burrito was even better then real sour cream.

The desserts are also incredible. They taste like indulgent desserts, not something that's good for you. But they are! And they have a huge selection of raw desserts.

The only issue I have is that the serving staff didn't seem to know much about the food they were serving. I feel like its a reasonable question to ask what others around you are eating, and how they might make something... but no one knew a damn thing. I really need to know how they make that cashew sour cream. I would kill to know.

I can't wait to go back here again."}
{"text":"The place is kinda small and charming, liked the decoration. The menu is really a hook, so different and creative, seems to be delicious! Lot of options of vegan food and desserts too!

I didn't like the food too much, the tastes in my salad were not really matching.. or even without taste, as the dessert was. I got so frustrated. But, the beans burger was good, nice size of sanduíche and the side sauce was different and good too.

The service is slow, I know they don't have many people, but the restaurant gets busy (I went there in the lunch) and they need more servers. I almost gave up of the dessert because it took sooooo long.
I will give it another change and hope to be able to update this review with good news."}
{"text":"I don't think you can find better Vegan options in Toronto than this place. They have literally thought of everything. If I could recommend anything on their menu, it would be the Reuben. Very good."}
{"text":"Just because I like vegan food, and I am willing to walk all the way up to Dupont St to have lunch on a nice sunny day, doesn't mean I have all day to wait for my food, to search for a salt shaker (which you hand to me empty), to wait for the bill and to wait even longer to pay the bill for my slightly overpriced salad... means I won't be coming back any time soon:-("}
{"text":"Raw food is hard to like when its being manipulated into menu items that were invented with baking, frying and boiling very much in mind. Nonetheless, Live does a pretty good job. They are seriously expensive if you`re going for a casual meal though. The service can be a little uptight but only at times and it`s a little uncomfortable inside so make sure to score yourself the most comfortable looking spot. If you are craving a seriously healthy dessert and a freshly squezed juice that will send you and your liver on a three minute detox then your in luck.

I`ve spent time in their kitchen and it`s relatively clean and the chefs really seem to care about what they are serving.

NEVER, order the raw sushi; you think you like it for a couple bites before you realize you are eating a paste resembling mashed compost that is sour and pâté like.

The simpler the better I think in this case, don`t order the mystery items."}
{"text":"Tried their chickpea burger and loved it. The chickpea flavor was heightened by the perfectly spiced chipotle spread. The bun wasn't chewy or doughy, had great flavor.
It has a cool covered patio, the indoor seating is great too. The desert could have used some more sugar or naturally sweet flavoring. Would definitely go again if I find myself in Toronto."}
{"text":"Would definitely go back. Found the portions of the mains slightly small and definitely could have done a starter or a full desert. Particularly as I realized that the desert was the real star.... AMAZING. Definitely do not make my mistake and share it with a friend. You need it all. All. They all look awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the last year and I can't say that things have gotten better. The trouble is, the menu changes, portions get smaller, and prices go higher. Service has taken a bit of a nosedive - I came here for dinner last night and I had to flag down a member of the staff when I was lucky enough to have them whoosh by my table without so much as a side glance. On both recent visits I wanted to take the rest of my food to go but the waiter didn't even ask us how our meals were, so it was hard to get their attention.

Some of the food also seems to be getting very oily. The sweet potato \"fries\" were really not \"fries\" so much as sliced up rounds of fried sweet potatoes covered in oil. Not impressed with that, although my tempeh was very good. 

Worst offenders: I paid $7 for a very TINY glass \"smoothy\" of pineapple juice mixed with coconut milk. I mean...REALLY?!  The basement area (where the washrooms are located) smelled so badly that I ran up the stairs as fast as I could. Service gets slower and more indifferent each time I come here, regardless of customer traffic.
 
I think the management has become complacent here. They took a long time to respond to an email I sent them earlier and there seems to be less of a concerted effort to impress. Doubly disappointing since now I'll have to take this off my list of favorites. What a shame."}
{"text":"The Black bean burger with tempeh was amazingly fresh, delicious, and satisfying. Burger was topped with fresh micro greens and guacamole. The meal included yummy and healthy root vegetable crisps! Service was excellent. Will be back with all my friends!"}
{"text":"My review is very mixed. 

The overall  atmosphere is clean, modern and enticing.The food was excellent but the service was lacking to the point that I am not sure I would return.  

They have a wonderful and extensive menu of healthy drinks and juices.  The entrees were creative, tasty and well presented. The deserts however are not on the menu but in a case at the front of the restaurant and looked like they had been sitting for sometime. I can not attest to their flavors as I could never get a waitress to return to the table for me to place an order.

The main issue here is with service. Upon entering, the hostess was too busy playing with the music and could barely greet us, eventually stating that we could just sit anywhere. Initially the  one waitress was fairly quick to bring menus and the entrees that followed. But as she and the hostess drifted back to the kitchen, basically everyone in the restaurant was being ignored for their gossip time. Efforts to make eye contact, wave or gain their attention in anyway was simply impossible.  Other patrons had to literally get up and walk back to the kitchen to even get a check. 

I had hoped to cap off my meal with a coffee and desert but gave up in frustration and found a very nice cafe up the block. The food and concept at Live is great, someone simply needs to supervise the children, who would rather play then attend to customers."}
{"text":"Open to all sorts of deliciousness and recently trying on vegan pants, my friend suggested I check out \"Live\" with her for weekend brunch. Initially I found the prices to be on the higher side but for 100% organic smoothies, juice and food, it is actually quite reasonable. The juices are mostly $10/glass but they have other drink specials that sound divine and are a lower price point (coconut water, lime leaves, coriander, sparkling water - or something along those lines at $6.50). 

The menu is extensive making the choice difficult - the vegan waffles with cashew cream, maple syrup and fresh strawberries? Or the black bean burrito with guac and all the fixings (my friend ordered this and enjoyed it)? In the end I went for the \"Full English\" - tofu scramble, beans, \"bacon\" (tempeh - was hoping this would be crispy/blacked and with a smokey flavour but it was literally just slices of unmarinated/seasoned tempeh - rather disappointing), grilled tomato, roast potatoes (bland - could have used a squeeze of lemon and more sea salt/crispiness). Not the best vegan brunch I've had (still a fan of the crispy polenta brunch at Aux Vivres in Mtl) but a solid plate of delicious organic food overall. And while there were many coffee alternatives it would have been nice to have the option of pairing the \"Full English\" with a cup of strong fair trade joe. 

For dessert we shared the Tiramisu and it was pretty divine. Raw, coconut based with a hint of espresso. 

I will most likely return to try one of their salads or possibly just another hit of that Tiramisu..."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service was bad enough to keep me away forever. 

We were seated at the patio and ignored for 20 minutes, while a server took 3 trips to sloooooowly clear one table around us.  (There were 4 tables around us that were dirty and hadn't been cleared yet either).  When someone finally took notice of us, she asked if we had ordered yet, even though we had no water and no menus.  It took them another 30 mins until another annoyed server (that I had to flag down) reluctantly took our order.  It took them the course of our entire meal to not bring us cutlery at all.  

If they had shown any urgency or the slightest care about serving us, it would have made a world of difference to our dining experience.  Bye Live!"}
{"text":"You don't have to be a raw vegan or even a vegetarian to like this food. I love everything I've had, and I have been there a few times. The setting is cafeteria like, the service is totally blasais to say the least, but the food is the thing, and I happen to like it. The price is prohibitive for my budget yes thats true enough, but the premise is raw (or cooked) organic foods, most of which they make in house and also distribute to heathy grocers. They have an unexpectedly nice washroom."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time with a friend last week. I ordered the kale caesar and the bacon avocado burger. I also tried the strawberry cheesecake and a chocolate macaroon for dessert. I thoroughly enjoyed the kale caesar. The portion was large enough that I thought I was going to have leftovers but tasty enough that it didn't happen. The burger was very flavourful and I love the way the burger is topped. My only complaint would be that both the bun and the burger were falling apart by the end of it... but I managed. ;)
For me, the dessert was the real MVP. Don't skip out on the strawberry cheesecake, it was probably one of the best I've had. Great spot for vegans like myself, or vegan and gluten free, like my friend."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I don't give a shit about how healthy my food is and, before visiting Live, I thought raw food was a total gimmick. I say this only to emphasis that anyone can enjoy Live regardless of the type of diet or food philosophy you subscribe to.

The various dishes have been described by other reviews so I won't go in to too much detail. I will say that after several visits to Live I've never had a bad dish and each time I'm impressed by how fresh, inventive, and delicious the food is. It totally amazes me what can be done without actually cooking anything. Live scores very high on the \"there's no way I could make that at home\" scale. And, despite my above comments on health, I must say that I always feel excellent after eating at Live.

Two complaints about Live cause it to lose one star. First, I find the prices too high. This probably has something to do with the irony of raw food: it actually takes more to NOT cook food. But, at ~$10 for apps and ~$15-$20 for mains, it seems like a lot to pay for vegetables. I would visit Live A LOT more often if dishes were a few dollars cheaper. This goes for just about every vegan place in the city.

My second complaint is more minor. When it comes to dessert, ignore everything I said above about Live being a place anyone can enjoy. I've had 3 or 4 different desserts and my conclusion is that unless you're a sprout-eating hippy the desserts are weak. Further evidence for my theory that good vegan desserts are a highly elusive commodity.

Probably my favourite vegan/vegetarian restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"It was a rather unusual way to celebrate Valentine's Day this year lol. No blue rare steak, no seafood platter, no alcohol. My date and I both agreed on eating a bit more healthy recently, so we have decided to explore this cozy raw/organic/vegan restaurant up in The Annex neighbourhood.

Definitely very different from what I have expected. A bit on the pricey side but I really enjoyed the food (some were a bit off for me!), and service was very friendly and attentive. I love how they also have an extensive drinks menu with lots of smoothies and fresh juices to choose from. Alcohol is also available :)

The Pulled Burdock Burrito was the highlight of my meal :D It was packed with so much flavours and the tortilla wrap was crispy ^_^ I couldn't stop eating it and I didn't want to share it with my date lol #hogs. I also loved their use of so many variety of veggies that compliments so well with each dish.

The use of mock meats were quite interesting. Not a big fan of the \"bacon\" on my crunchy kale caesar salad, but they certainly did a good job on the \"parmesan\" cheese! Their version of manicotti was very good too. The stuffed \"cheese\" was light and creamy, and was wrapped with a layer of cucumber to replace the pasta :) Love it!

The Chocolate Avocado Mousse cake was a nice final touch to end our meal. It was really light and smooth. And according to the server, it is actually super easy to make - just whip milk, avocado, and cocoa powder together! The chocolate chip cookies on the other hand were not my favourite... I love LOTS of sugar in my cookies, sorry lol.

I'm still very new to vegan options. One con about after having a healthy meal like this was that my date and I both felt bloated afterwards because of all that fiber we consumed. High soluble fiber foods tend to produce gas while we digest. Apparently it is very common for people who are not used to high fiber meals, so don't be alarmed if you feel the same way! Just let it out lol.

I would definitely revisit Live for brunch next time,  still have a lot to explore :) But it is definitely not something I would eat regularly... maybe once in a while would be a good cleanse for my body lol. #carnivore #carbslover"}
{"text":"The food is generally fabulous. I got their infamous Black Bean Burrito, and although the brown rice tortilla was greasy beyond belief, the filling was fucking ambrosia, so the greasiness was no biggie for me. My friend got the raw pizza and I just wanted to keep eating and eating and eating that thing. Urrrggghhhh sooooo gooodddd.

Imma girl who is big on protein, and need a fair amount to feel full and satisfied, and after having our mains, I still felt like I could pack in another main (the menu is heavy on light fares and clean eating, honestly it all looked so good.)  I also wanted dessert, so I settled on the raw \"pecan pie\" and a chocolate surrender smoothie to wash it all down. The pecan was a touch on the too sweet & rich side (but still pretty delicious as far as vegan desserts go) and the smoothie was pure heaven.

I felt pretty full after this so that was A+

Now, the reason Live Food Bar only gets 3 stars from me because their service is hilariously relaxed. And by that I mean, the servers aren't all that observant. We very obviously grabbed a table with dirty plates with leftover food and sat there waiting for about 5 minutes as servers passed us by again and again before we literally had to wave someone down to have them clear the table. No Beuno. Then, after we got menus and put them down, indicating we were ready, 3 different servers breezed past us a total of 15 times before we had to wave someone over again to order. So that was slightly annoying. But the food is delicious enough to warrant my return."}
{"text":"At first I was put off by the fact that my reservation wasnt ready for me (I had made a reservation for 8). The waitress kindly put a few tables together for me, and I waited and waited. doh! Turns out I was an hour early!!!  But I get the feeling that they had totally forgotten about my reservation....so good thing I was crazy early!!

I had the Raw special of the day. It was ok, but didn't amaze me and it came with a disappointing side salad. If you are a vegan raw restaurant you should do a side salad better (it was just just your normal plain spring mix with a few julienned carrots added and dressing - geez put some sprouts and other vegetables in there!!!) . I found myself very envious of my two companions that had opted for the cooked options (the pasta and the grain bowl), they were both satisfied with their meals.

Negatives worth noting:

The appetizers cost as much as he mains, so sadly I will never try them. Appetizers range from $10 to $16. 

They give you a big hassle and try to guilt you if you ask for separate bills. \"Oh its going to be really hard to do that.  How will I do this? It's going to be really difficult. Maybe I'll have to get your names or initials....\" Honestly I don't care how you do it. It's a restaurant so give me a separate bill!! This is my #1 pet peeve in restaurants."}
{"text":"This is the first time coming here and will definitely be back! I ordered the tostadas which i could believe how delicious they were. So much flavour in each bite. I have had a lot of different tostadas in my life but it doesn't compare to the ones that I have had here. For desert I had the pecan pie, it was good nothing to get excited over but than I tasted it with the strawberry garnish and it was even better. Overall I will be back soon and will recommend Live to everybody!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a unique dining experience and LOFB fits the bill. 

Not a raw foodie, I ordered the beet burger and was shocked by how much flavour was packed into a plate of uncooked vegetables? I'm coming back.  Also had one of the green juices and I felt like a million bucks. 

Staff are friendly, atmosphere is relaxed & pricing reflects the quality of food served."}
{"text":"It's pretty cool that a place like this even exists. The menu was all delicious and not as scary as some place can be. I don't eat meat alternatives so it was nice to see a menu with options that had food I recognized! The meal was tasty and well price. Hope to get back and try more."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy. The service can either be really good or really bad. Once they completely forgot about me outside! Not cool. Their cooked menu is definitely not to be overlooked, it's quite delicious. Their food is delicious. Their salad dressing is made in-house so depending on who's working it tastes different. Once I went and it was absolutely amazing and another time I got the same one and it was only so-so. The salads are big and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. They're organic. Their tea menu is ok, but nothing too impressive. Their cocktail menu is quite interesting--they use their juicer to make mixers for their cocktails, it seems. I do this at home already. They try to be healthy and cater to drinking people but their drinks, though creative, aren't all that great. They don't put enough alcohol in the drink last time I went for a drink. They have a nice back patio which is nice in the summer. This is my go-to healthy spot whenever I feel like I need to snap out of my poor eating habits and start eating healthy."}
{"text":"I am usually a really big fan of their food and I enjoy the taste of what they make. However, I recently bought their bread at a health food store and it was completely mouldy, although it was expiring in one month. They mentioned that it may have been the stores fault that they didn't store it properly, which is understandable. As such, I had some email exchanges with Live Organics regarding their bread and refunds. At the bottom of the email, one of their representatives, Liz, responded my email and ended with calling me a \"stupid extortionist\" because I had checked if they were able to do anything other than a refund for this situation (I think she meant to delete it but she accidentally left it in the email). This was an incredibly unprofessional email and as a frequent consumer of their goods, being called this term was both unpleasant and uncalled for (screenshot attached)."}
{"text":"This place has the worst food I have ever tried. I understand Live has organic, and raw foods, but that doesn't mean i shouldn't have flavour. I went with a friend and we split the chick pea fries. They were so disgusting, I would have rather have had plain chick peas. The \"spicy mayo\" that it came with was actually just a Dijon mustard, and it also just came with a pretty boring and bad salsa.
My friend and I also had the chick pea burger and that was so gross my friend couldn't even finish hers. The patty was just mush with no flavour, it had the nasty \"spicy mayo\" on it, one tomato, lettuce, and a \"cheese\" that was more like a bad cracker. Overall the food I tasted was awful and definitely not worth the price. Their
drinks are also extremely overpriced, and I understand that they are organic, and they have to make some sort of profit, but seriously, a smoothie for around 8 dollars is just ridiculous.
horrible, horrible, horrible."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS ONE OF THE BEST. PERIOD.

The food is freshly made, super tasty and light on your stomach.

The service is superb and friendly.

Their patio is amazing in the summer.

How can you not love this place? Seriously? It's heaven for any vegan or vegetarian."}
{"text":"You wanna hear something funny? I didn't even know that this place specialized in (ie. served at all) \"raw\", \"vegan\" food until someone told me afterwards. Maybe it's because I only stumbled in with my friend, who needed to sit down and have some tea (was feeling ill).  I thought it was a simple juice bar, and didn't even realize it was a sit-down restaurant til I went in.

It was like a whole other world. A bright and cheery, meatless world. I loved the vibrant decor, saturated green and orange everywhere. Only when I noticed the quotation marks around words like \"meat\" and \"cheese\" and \"burger\" and \"bacon\" did it clue in that they were even vegetarian. Maybe this is because I just didn't want to know. Ha-ha. I kid.

I am a weirdo and a lush and not equipped to give a proper opinion, since all I had was a, *ahem* margarita at 3 in the pm. It was called \"Purple Rain\" and was pretty good. Made with an organic vodka, at an organic price. I would have tried something more, had I not just eaten before going in. Since I have a hard time with merely *vegetarian food* a raw vegan restaurant is a bit of a hard sell for me- but if I decide to take that step, I'll be going back. They played Marvin Gaye and Elvis albums in their entirety, after all."}
{"text":"I just cannot do it... I just cannot watch my \"Vegan for Lent\" friend to eat beans boiled in water with rice while I eat my meat.....

Now is her turn at Live Organic Food Bar where she can proudly announces that she can eat anything and everything on the menu!

Chickpea Fries ($10)
- the cornmeal gives the fries a hint of sweetness
- quite filling.. and enjoyable

BBQ 'Pulled' Burdock ($15)
- Gluten free buns tasted like over toasted bagels
- Burdock has this fully taste and texture which I find it meh... the tofu though tasted good! 

Gnocchi with Rose Cream ($16) 
- pretty hearty and tasty
- the sauce is surprising good with sun dried tomato and argula 

S'more ($8)
- I am not used to healthy dessert.... without butter, egg and cream.. the \"cake\" itself is rock solid hard... we just stabbing at it trying to break that apart
- dark chocolate makes everything OK...

I am not converted.... I can eat Vegan food once in awhile but I don't think I can make it my lifestyle... BTW, I hope my date is not going to be on a Vegan, Raw and Gluten and Nut free diet, if so I'm going to just buy some organic lettuce and carrots and feed that to her instead, at least that will be way way cheaper!

The beer and cocktail list seems to be ok, I think I can handle those! Maybe I am just go on a Vegan drinking only diet!"}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for 7 years. It has had its ups and downs. Last couple of years though it has really pulled it together. Consistent quality of organic food and really tasty. The Pulled Burdock is really amazing. Great atmosphere to enjoy and family based. Jennifer has put her energy in all the right places. Definitely one of my most favorite restaurants in Toronto!!
Good organic smoothies and elixers"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ran into each other in the parking garage one night after work, both feeling tired and famished.  A bad combination when your plan is to hit the gym.  Our bodies were begging us for nourishment.   We knew the workout would take the back seat this time and we would succumb to our hunger, grabbing food somewhere.   The compromise - we needed to choose something  healthy.  This sounded like the perfect opportunity to try the Live Organic Food Bar, a raw vegan restaurant who offers \"an array of gourmet, gluten and sugar free, vegan dishes to invigorate and cleanse your body, mind, and soul\".    Those are their words, not mine.  So we put them to the test and made our way to Dupont St (you can't possibly feel guilty eating at a place called \"Live\").

The Menu:   It was very similar to Raw Aura in some respect.  Kale salad and \"sushi\" made with sunflower pate were a few of the familiar items, but there was no shortage of menu options.   The menu offered an average of 5 items under each category: Appetizers, Salads, Rice Bowls, Sandwiches, Burgers and of course, Shakes and Desserts.   I was so engrossed in the menu and deciding what to order,  that I didn't realize the menu caught on fire!   Apparently plastic and candlelight don't mix.  Hee, hee...oops!

 I made my decision to go ultra healthy with a bowl of steamed greens topped with hemp oil, dulse, sprouted mung beans, sunflower seed sprouts.  I paid a few extra dollars to add some tempeh and extra protein to the dish, and boy am I glad I did.  I expected to see a visible portion of dulse (seaweed) but had to squint really hard to find the 'dulse flakes' that were merely sprinkled on the bowl of veggies.   The dish was what I was looking for...a guilt-free bowl of goodness but I still disappointed.  Why?   I was suffering from food envy.   My boyfriend had ordered the better meal and I wanted it. 

Sunshine Wrap ($10) -   This was Keith's order, and the result of my food envy.   The wrap, made from sprouted flax seeds, sun-dried tomatoes and carrots was the perfect balance in terms of texture.  Delicate enough to cradle the abundance of veggies (sunflower seed hummus, cucumbers, kale, tomatoes, red onions, avocado and sprouts), hearty enough to keep the contents together and give the wrap some substance.   Keith and I did our usual taste exchange (he tries my meal, and I try his) which was a big mistake.   His was better than mine and I wanted it.    Hence my food envy.  He must have been sick of my pouting , because halfway through our meal he offered to switch plates and let me enjoy the rest of his wrap.   Now that's love.  I was thrilled but tried not to make it obvious, quietly savouring every bite.   So long food envy!


Raspberry cheesecake ($10 - I think) -  We debated for 15 minutes whether to go for dessert.  Afterall, we bailed on working out and should have 'punished' ourselves accordingly.   BUT (yes there's always a but when it comes to dessert), Live's desserts are all homemade without any flours or refined sugars.  The excuse - we HAD to compare their cheesecake to the AMAZING version we had at Raw Aura.    The verdict - It was good.  But not as good as our first non-cheesecake experience.   The serving was about 1/3 the size which hurt the rating as well."}
{"text":"I have a gluten issue and due to this, Live has become one of my favourite restaurants as it caters very well to the gluten free diet. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful, service staff friendly and the food is divine and fresh. You MUST start with the nachos YUM!"}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of good vegan/vegetarian restaurants.  This one is the best, in my opinion.  It's slightly more expensive than its competitors (Fresh, Urban Herbivore), but the quality of the preparation here is better, as is the presentation.  Having said that, I've only tried the salads.  Anyway, highly recommend this place- the desserts look amazing."}
{"text":"Lovely patio at the back, but the periodic train passing through may startle you. 

We has the full English Breakfast and the Pad Thai. The portion sizes are very big and the dishes were very tasty (and very yummy according to our 9y old!). 

We tried the Earl Grey iced tea with maple syrup and the organic turmeric lemonade. 

Parking is a bit tight in the area. 

The service was prompt and efficient."}
