{"text":"Get family own resurant. I wish the customer service was a little better but other then that I ate my food left with my belly full and happy."}
{"text":"Googled Italian restaurants near my hotel in Calgary while on a business trip.  Glad this one popped up.  Cozy spot.  Very very nice people - great service.  Had an excellent carbonara and Caesar salad.  I'd come back if ever in Calgary again."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here with my boyfriend! I recommend the moscato wine if you want a delicious white wine! They give you complimentary bread and butter and the bread was so warm and soft. We got calamari as an appetizer, which was good. The main courses were delicious, I had the chicken. Overall, it was a great experience and the restaurant has a great atmosphere and ambiance."}
{"text":"Sandro's is now named Rea's Italian Cucina. After the fire, they rebuilt and they are back with a vengeance! 

I went there for my birthday a few days ago and I must say that I'm sad I never knew about this place before!! 

We had made reservations and I'm glad we did, the place was full of happy dining people. The atmosphere is cozy and warm and full of life. Our waiter was very attentive and funny throughout the evening and he was very efficient and quick which I always appreciate. 

I ordered the bruchetta to start. It was so delicious! It wasn't too garlicky,but was full of flavour and crunch. Next up we ordered some calamari. WOW. It was the stewed kind, not the deep fried kind. It showed up piping hot in a tangy tomato sauce that was herbaceous and made me say mmmmmm with every bite! I had never had calamari this way before, I might not be able to go back to the fried variety! 

Our main meal was two medium pizzas. The first was the Michelangelo pizza which is smoked salmon, capers, onions and olive oil. I was in pizza heaven! First off, I have issues with smoked salmon most of the time because its too 'smoked' and you don't actually taste any salmon, NOT on this pizza! It was cooked perfectly and the salty treasures of the capers were just perfect. I am currently dreaming about this pizza day and night. 

The second pizza we ordered was the Rea's Special. It was Pepperoni, capicolla, mushrooms, olives, green peppers. It was full of flavours, a bit spicy but perfectly cooked. I can honestly say that I won't be able to eat pizza again and not compare it to Rea's pizza. 

With a couple bottles of wine and a free shot courtesy of our kind waiter for my birthday, it was a wonderful night. I would recommend this place to anybody. Go out for a romantic night with your honey or take all your friends and get into the Italian mood of good food and drink.

{"text":"Great local hole in the wall place, small and quaint. Huge portions of good honest Italian food, big menu. The lasagna is delicious, the tiramisu is ok. Most ppl at my table ordered pastas and they all were great. The place is busy only even a Monday, so if the locals love it then it must be a great neighbourhood staple. A tad expensive though IMO."}
{"text":"Just went there for dinner tonight. The service was very good. The server was very attentive. However, the food was hit and miss. My friend and I shared the calamari appetizer and it tender with a tangy tomato sauce. Was it the most memorable calamari I've ever had? No... but it wasn't bad either. It was decent/acceptable. The entrees were a little strange. Both my friend and I ordered veal. He had the vitello marsala which was basically veal with a marsala sauce. The marsala sauce turned out to be a lot sweeter than we were expecting. I had the vitello francesco which was veal with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce. It was decent. The veal was very tender and the sauce was flavorful. However, both entrees were paired with their pasta of the day which happened to be penne in a tangy tomato sauce topped with parmesan. The pasta itself was decent..  nothing spectacular.. something you could have ordered at one of the pasta places in the food court. However, pairing that tangy tomato with either a sweet marsala-sauced entree or a brandy cream-sauced entree was a very odd combination. I wish they could have served something else for the side pasta to make our dining experience more pleasant.. I could have enjoyed the simple pasta on its own or the veal in brandy sauce on its own, but definitely not both on the same plate. And I don't think I could have enjoyed the sweet marsala sauce as an entree no matter how it was presented.

For dessert, we had their tiramisu. That was very tasty!  Almost enough for me to give this place 3 stars. The tiramisu was very creamy with the right amount of alcohol. I'd definitely order the tiramisu again.

I had high hopes for this place. I read rave reviews and I've had friends who been there and raved about this place. Perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes?!? This place is supposed to be famous for their pizza too. I think I'd be willing to go back to give their pizza a try... although I didn't see a wood oven there like at Pulcinellas... so I wonder what Sandro's pizza would be like. This isn't a bad place if you're looking for something closer to a home-cooked meal. The dishes are good value. However, it is a place to \"write home about\" either."}
{"text":"Rea has a very warm family atmosphere and the folks there make you feel welcomed. 

The place is simple and unpretentious, not very big, but tasteful. They have numerous veal dishes, pasta dishes and pizza. The veal is quite good and cooked well with a nice creamy sauce. The pasta, I must admit has an excellent tomato sauce (the veal normally comes with pasta with tomato sauce on the side).  I was impressed by the quality of the tomato sauce.  Unfortunately, the pasta was ruined by being overcooked (a mortal sin in Italy).  This happened all three times I have been there. Rea, if you are reading this: please, please, please, make it al dente per favore!!!  The only other comment is the quality of the mozzarella cheese used on pizza and some veals which is mediocre in my view. The bread is quite good, warm and abundant: perfect for \"scarpetta\".

Overall, I found myself going back there twice more after trying it the first time, even though is far from where I live and work.  Is not that I consider this place \"authentic\" Italian; rather, when you taste something and the flavour brings back memories you thought you forgot, then I think something must be really good about it.  That, and the fact that I have pretty high standard for Italian food, means I'm giving Rea's a fairly high score :-)"}
{"text":"4+ for food, 2 for service - averages 3?

We arrived earlier than Friday dinner rush, without a reservation. Three of us, myself and two children 14 and 11. Other families inside, so great to know we picked a family-friendly place. Seated quickly. Handed menus, no introductions, no specials, no real communication, or welcome. 

Food was AMAZING! Garlic scampi and calamari to start - delicious! Pizza was real Italian style! Fettuccini Alfredo (which besides pizza is one of only a few other kid friendly items on the menu) was ordered without mushrooms for a child. Don't do that!! It was very plain/boring. Like noodles with butter. Had to request Parmesan on the side. 

No offers of pepper, anything else?, No check-ins through entire dinner. Took some time to notice we were done. Took leftover food away to be packed. We had to ask about dessert, which we then ordered. Tiramisu- AMAZING! My 14 year old son tasted - and loved - the booze... :)

Bus boy came and cleaned up around us. And then we waited - and waited - and waited - for a bill. 25 minutes. A few staff, but hard to get anyone's attention. 
They all seemed busy with new guests. One table of 6 guests had 3 servers/staff hanging around, socializing, discussing wine and menu. etc.  Kids got tired of waiting, gathered them up with leftovers, and went to front bar/reception to ask for bill and pay. 

I was honest and I expressed my REAL pleasure for the food, but that it felt service really dropped off at the end, I was met with cold, rude staff. I paid debit, said again that food was amazing as payment was processing. No eye contact - 4 people at front area - and apparently I was now the bad guy. I left 10%, and left the restaurant. IMO that 10% should only go to the kitchen staff, as the food was truly delicious!

I will go back for the food, and will be open to a better customer service experience."}
{"text":"Service was good
Food was Excellent
Lunch hour seems a bit loud but expected the place was busy. 
Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with friends.  I went with a friend who was a regular and wanted something different. So they made something special and all 3 of us ordered it. Veal wrapped with shrimp and prosciutto in their pizzianola sauce.   It was very good with side salad.   We also had bread and shrimp scampi for appetizers which was also excellent.   The pace was great as the food came out quick but not too fast where we felt rushed to complete our meals.  We have a great time and the entire staff was friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"A few days after I wrote this, the place burned down in what the FD determined was arson. I feel great having just called the place a \"Sopranos hang out\"."}
{"text":"Weird location but awesome find.

A group of us went here for dinner Friday night. Like other Yelpers have said, reservations are important because the place fills fast. There were so many things I liked about Rea's.
First of all the mood of the place. Upbeat, friendly, warm, like going to an old friends for a dinner party. People around us were laughing, smiling and engaged in conversation. Sometimes you go out and you feel the need to be reserved, proper and calm. Rea's was so comfortable it was easy to relax and enjoy the evening.

The food. Oh the food. Simple Italian food made with real, tasty ingredients and care. Home-cooked goodness with restaurant feel. We had the homemade sausage appie to start. Basically sausage in a rich tomato sauce. It was quite good. I then had veal in a lemon wine sauce. It was very good too. I had it with the side pasta which, while simple, was cooked perfectly. Their tomato sauce is so good I could put it on anything. I found the portions to be quite reasonable. I was full at the end but not overwhelmingly. The man had veal in a mushroom cognac sauce. He quite enjoyed it and loved how homey everything tasted.

The decor was nice casual. My partner really liked the murals. He said often in Italian or Greek restaurants with murals he's though a high school art class did them. He commented that these seemed quite professional and well maintained. The restaurant had a cozy feeling without being too dark. It was loud but you could still hear everyone talk.

The service was good too. You can tell from photos around the place they are all family or have been there long enough to be family. Always nice to see that kind of employee engagement. Our waiter was also a great help in ordering wine, helping us decide as a group what would be the best value. I love that. Also, despite our group being 88 people, there was no 18% auto gratuity! Something SO many other Calgary establishments could learn from.

We didn't end up trying dessert which I'd like to do next time. They all sounded so good!"}
{"text":"I'm here on business for 2 weeks and have driven by this restaurant a couple times but never went in because of the location and the exterior looks a bit like cheap rent. One of the guys I'm here with said he was told by the company we are visiting that this is the place for good Italian food. We made our way there today for lunch. Wow, all the Yelp reviews are pretty much spot on! The food outstanding, the service, not so much. But I am definitely coming back. I tried the lasagna and was amazed that they make their own sauce and pasta for this dish. Nothing like home cooked meals.
Was a bit surprised they serve white bread with butter instead of an olive oil dip. Not a deal breaker for me though. Amazing selection of meals on the menu so you shouldn't have any problem finding something for your taste on any given meal. 

We were seated at the bar because the place was packed for lunch. I had a few issues with this. One, from where we were seated, we looked straight into the kitchen watching them do dishes, and 2, the bar is super small and all the while they are washing glasses and dumping old drinks in the sink in front of you so you catch a bit of smell from splashed waste. So if you can help it, don't sit at the bar, that's really all I can say."}
{"text":"The food was decent, although a couple of pasta dishes we got were a bit too oily (especially the carbonara). Tiramisu was excellent and was the highlight of the evening, white chocolate desert felt grainy and not something I'd get again. Was not very happy with the service - it's a bit slow and the waiter forgot to bring my drinks twice."}
{"text":"Rea's is an institution amongst the guys I work with.  They would eat there daily if they could.  I love when I get a chance to go with them because it's like visiting family.  Everyone who works there is family so you always see familiar faces (which I love).  We also like to take our entire family (including kids) occasionally for special occasions.

Make sure when you go to get the \"bullets\" to eat with your rolls.  Roasted garlic and jalepenos make up the bullets and though you will stink to high heaven the next day...they're worth it.  My husband's favorite dish at Rea's is the pizza.  I lean more towards the carbonerra or the seafood pasta (can't remember the name).  We always get tiramisu for dessert.  

Rea's is not super high end, cutting edge Italian.  It is, however, great service and great food.  BTW...make sure & make reservations when dining for lunch or dinner because they are often booked solid."}
{"text":"This place was such a great surprise. I received a gift certificate from a friend for a gift. Never heard of it but she raves about it all the time. 

I finally used the gift certificate and wish I would have used  it sooner. It really was that great, from start to finish.

The place is small and cozy and it is a bit of a trek to the NE. When we arrived for our reservation we were greeted by such a friendly bubbly girl. Great start. She seated us. The decor is your classic old school Italian place and was dim and cozy. Our waiter was so friendly and recommended a few things to us since it was our first time and won't be the last time either. He really knew his stuff.

Started off with some wine....

Ordered for two: Calamari (to start). Baked lasagna and Veal Parmigiana (dinner) Tiramisu (dessert)

Everything was incredible. It would be hard to pick which was the favorite since  it all was done perfect and very authentic Italian food. Great portions too.

They have a very extensive menu and I need  to come back to try the other things that caught my eye. Well done Rea's. I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent pasta, outstanding veal, chicken is just average. Make a great thin crust pizza, and an excellent and very spicy Penne Arabiata. Service is attentive and friendly. Atmosphere is relaxed. Can go in casual to Tux and tails and feel comfortable.

Lunch at 12 or most evenings you will need reservations as this small restaurant fill quickly. Been going here regularly for 8 years, only once have we ever had an issue with food. Sent my wife's gluetin free pasta back because it wasn't cooked enough. Was back out in a jiffy and not only did they not charge for her meal, they covered the whole bill, drinks and wine included. Now that is someone that cares about their clients being satisfied.

Mid priced, excellent Italian fare. Well worth trying out."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time. Four of us started with the mussels in a tomato sauce. Very nice. Good sauce. It seemed homemade. And then ordered an antipasto platter. It was a little bit small for four. Then I followed with a main of veal with mushrooms and cognac sauce, served with penne and tomato sauce. The veal was wonderful and tender. It's no wonder, I took some home and after it cooled, I saw exactly how much fat was in there! Still delicious. I'm a salt maniac and felt no need to add any salt to the dishes. If you are sensitive to salt maybe the tomato sauces aren't for you.

The service was attentive and playful. I was a little unsure when our server gal told us \"you have to decide, if you haven't by now, you never will\". I thought that was an odd joke? but seeing as I was buying two $75 bottles of wine, I didn't know what the hurray was. It was already after 8pm. We didn't rush either way.

The location is odd and parking was very limited but I think I'll be back again to try the pizza next."}
{"text":"This is definitely place not to going to business meeting ,very unprofessional staff almost comical very rude way they talked
I understand it's they  culture maybe but in front of mixed company with women sitting at the table disgusting 
rude comments 
the meal was over salted
I will never attend again"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Kind of weird location but great value.  I think it's family owned, you know, when Mom cooks and the kids wait the tables..excellent pasta and especially the pizza!  Very lively best to make reservations.  Get the sasuage starter and the Big Guy pizza!"}
{"text":"Our meals were spectacular.  Great sauces and decent portions. Best and biggest portion of tiramisu I've had in Calgary."}
{"text":"Delicious! Best veal I have had in a long time. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner. Service varies depending on the server but the food keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little hidden gem! I absolutely adored their veal-stuffed crepes and the relaxed atmosphere. In addition to the crepes, the charcuterie-style appetizer and veal tortellini in rosé sauce was to die for. The restaurant is well kept and the music isn't too loud. The servers were well trained, attentive and dressed nicely. I can't get enough of the easy, timeless feel of the restaurant you can tell that there's been a great deal of love and time invested into the place. It's also very refreshing to not feel like you have to wolf down your meal in fifteen minutes or less. Although it's a little ugly on the outside, it's definitely worth stopping for!"}
{"text":"I was here with coworkers for lunch recently as my one coworker thought we would really like it. We sat upstairs, so I cant comment much for the downstairs decor. The upstairs decor was tacky - but I think intentionally so. I mean, if you plan to paint the Mona Lisa on the wall, surely you cant take yourself too seriously. 
I ordered the Penne Arabiatta. The potion size was substantial, unfortunately the pasta was very average. One of my coworkers had the lasagna and loved it.  Like many have said on here, the food is ok - some would eve say really good. The problem is the service. Now in our case, our server was friendly and pleasant, however the wait for food took forever. All tolled, it took almost 2 hours from start to finish for 5 people, no starters or dessert.  For that reason alone,  I would not return. During the lunch hour, and especially with this restaurant being frequented by business people you would think they would speed up the service. :( Sorry Reas, I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"In town for business and always look for local treasure and found it. Family run, home made! Great service! Started with the shrimp in a lemon wine sauce and found myself dipping my bread after the perfectly done shrimp were gone. Wanted the veal pescatore but went with the lasagna with their home made sausage. Kinda of halfway between sweet and hot, just right! My dish was great! Leaves me wanting to know how good the pescatore would be. Not a large place but very nice. Call ahead to be sure you don't miss it."}
{"text":"Clams and linguine in tomato sauce was delicious. Shared a veggie pizza and had a few bites of other things at the table. Everything was pretty good. It was a friendly environment. I definitely had a lot of leftovers. I would come back :)"}
{"text":"Great little  Italian place, family owned  and friendly. The food was hot and fresh, very well done."}
{"text":"Amazing family run restaurant. Authentic Italian cuisine in a nice intimate atmosphere. I had the fettuccine alfredo and it was perfect. I took a pizza home to my Husband and it smelled so good in the car that I almost pulled over to eat it."}
{"text":"Excellent home style Italian food. Nothing fancy just plain old good Italian food. The service could be improved but overall great price for great everyday food! Definitely get your money's worth as portions of the main are large. Mussels have a great sauce. Can't wait to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Solid family Italian restaurant. The inside is different than what you would expect seeing the outside of the building. I went here on a Monday night for family dinner which consisted of a party of 9.  We ordered a large vegetarian pizza to share for the group and everyone ordered their own dishes.  The portion sizes here are huge. I got the fettuccine pescatore for myself. I didn't enjoy this as much as my husband's penne primavera dish. It has no meat but the dish was fantastic.  Some of the guests got the linguine tutto mare which is one of the signature dishes; they all loved it. The pizza was also very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"It's amore! Taking it back old school with Godfather worthy decor, Rea's is a classic that just does it right. Sure, innovative fusion cuisine is all the rage but you just can't go wrong with a plain old bowl of spaghetti and meatballs and Rea proves that. 

Servers are passionate about the food and quick to tell you what their favorites are. The servings are large, rich and decadent. If I could eat this all the time I would but for the sake of my waistline and heart health I have to limit how often I come here. That aside, I haven't had a bad dish here. It's grandma's home style Italian cooking and it's done SO well. My favorites are the bolognese pasta, fettuccine Alfredo and the one with the seafood. The pasta is always perfectly al dente and the sauces mouthwateringly delicious. I walk away each time with leftover pasta, completely satisfied.  

Not convinced? Try for yourself and come here with an appetite and stretchy pants. You're going to get saucy, cheesy home style Italian so don't expect a cup size serving of pasta with some shaved truffle. This isn't that type of restaurant and it's absolutely perfect. Also, the house red wine is darn good."}
{"text":"Again a wonderful dinner, from the great food to the amazing people working there!!!
Thanks again Rea's!"}
{"text":"The place smelled and felt like a giant dishwasher. You know the smell of that steam that comes out of a dishwasher when you open it mid-cycle? The food was bleh. The pasta is NOT made in-house, which is terribly disappointing. The server said they get their pasta from somewhere else. I had their ravioli ($25) and I found that the vodka cream sauce didn't taste like vodka at all. Honestly, I could definitely make something better at home with Costco cheese ravioli and I have no background in cooking. My husband liked his veal though. The cognac sauce was nice. The server was really sweet but she didn't notice she dropped ice on my boots while pouring my water."}
{"text":"I've passed by Rea's many times over the years and just assumed it would be a dive based on the location and exterior of the building.  Wow, was I wrong.  I was here last night with a party of 8 and my jaw almost dropped when I walked in the door.  It is rather quaint and was buzzing with patrons.  The seating is cozy so even though the restaurant was rather loud, I could still hear my friends at the other end of the table as long as they spoke up a bit.  We dined and visited for several hours and by the end, a few of us were finding the backs of the chairs to be uncomfortable.  They just don't have any support, but this is a minor detail, really.  How often are you in a restaurant for more than 2hrs?

My spouse and I shared the Calamari Adriatica, which is an authentic dish.  I'm not a huge seafood fan so I only had a small portion.  I'm just used to eating breaded calamari and if you are too, understand that it's not what you're getting.  It was good though and my spouse really enjoyed it.  My main dish was the Ravioli Panna and I added the home-made sausage.  This meal was unbelievable.  That in itself deserves 5 stars.  The ravioli was very flavorful and well stuffed, the sauce is made with vodka and was deliciously rich.  The sausage has some kick and was a great accompaniment.  My spouse had the Vitello (veal) Parmigiana and said it was just okay.  I usually complain about being served white bread but they must make their own because it was warm, fresh and delicious.  They are also very generous with the bread and we were served more than we needed.  

I'd definitely recommend eating at Rea's at least once.  Service was friendly and based on my first experience, it's a Highland Park hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Amazing how busy this little outta the way place is on a Tuesday for lunch. Glad I made a reservation for our group of 8...... Veal and various pastas were tried and enjoyed by everyone, reasonable prices and great service make this place a winner. Just don't forget to make a reservation, even for lunch on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Family-owned Classic Italian restaurant with some of the best Italian food I've ever had outside of Italy. Food was outstanding from pizza to pasta to vitello. From the outside, It looks like a plain pipe-rack place near an automotive store, but the interiors are very nice, prices are good and ambiance is very pleasant. Definitely a great stop."}
{"text":"It's good. Fancy. Authentic Italian food. Pricing is typical to good Italian dishes. Wish our pizza had more on it though, need to try more dishes. The linguine was great and flavour spot on. Would go again. Fresh bread a plus. Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend on September 14. The service was terrific, my water glass was never empty. Had scampi appetizer in a simple butter/wine/garlic sauce and it was divine! Then sopped it up with the lovely bread provided. Ordered Fettuccini Pescatore (shrimps/scallops in a vodka creme sauce) which was pitch perfect. I was pleased that they could substitute spaghetti for fettuccini. Very generous portions and reasonable prices. ($22 pasta fed me for 2 meals). The atmosphere is perfect for a leisurely lunch. The only thing I was disappointed with was the caesar salad...limp, bitter, room temperature and the croutons appeared to be from-a-box. I would have sent it back but didn't want to make a fuss in front of my friend. But this place still deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and more great service. I started with a Cesar salad with home made dressing, which was awesome, and then I had the Vitello Pescatore (Veal medallions served with prawns and scallops in a light spicy tomato sauce). I've never had veal before so I had nothing to compare it to, but really it wasn't anything special. That being said, everything else was great and the service was the best I've had in months. I've been told their pizza's are awesome so if you're going here, that's what I would recommend trying."}
{"text":"Rea's has been a staple in Calgary for a number of years, this is my first visit here despite being told by a number of people that I should make this a regular stop. Authentic Italian cuisine decent portions and a great atmosphere make this a place I will definitely return to."}
{"text":"Miserable, horrible, ugly service! How could I forget about Rea's and not dedicate a nasty review to it...

During a lunch time this place is packed. Simply because there's nothing \"Italian\" in the surrounding area. Public is mostly visiting office folks that moved outside for a long lunch, without too many nearby options in the industrial zone.

Food is ok. Nothing amazing, nothing to dream about - but not bad. Portions were reasonably filling for a price, but I can't recommend anything.

Service is a real Rea's killer - hopelessly failing to sit you, get the order, bring it to you, get you a bill... everything is wrong with those guys! And when you pay at the counter, they show attitude and throw nasty looks - for that they squeeze a moment, but not for anything they're supposed to be in there.

I solemnly discourage you from visiting Rea's. Not that you'd find it easily in that crumpled corner next to the tires store and such anyway, but even if you will - just keep on driving, there is plenty of Italian places in Calgary, and most of them are better than Rea's."}
{"text":"Great Italian faire. Good food. Good experience.  Enjoyable family atmosphere.  Book ahead to ensure you get in."}
