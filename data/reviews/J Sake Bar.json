{"text":"I found this lovely place by accident and I'm glad I did. A nice variety of sake along with Asashi beer on tap. The atmosphere feels exactly like other bars I visited while visiting Japan. My friends and I make it a MUST to visit at least once a week. With a smoke free environment, great Japanese music playing, and the extremely kind  and lovely Keiko serving I cannot hype this bar enough."}
{"text":"The best Sake bar I've ever been to! Keiko was the best. The best customer service I've ever received  definitely my spot now"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Cozy, nice music video mixes, not too loud where we can carry on conversations.  Best feature: friendly bar tender and host Keiko.  Will definitely come back.  Great hangout place."}

{"text":"I love Cocokara and this place has the same owner! When I first walked in I saw a large party having the time of their lives singing Japanese karaoke.   I went straight to the bar to order some sake! My boyfriend and I ordered the sake sampler that was $18. It came with three different  2 oz sakes!   I loved them all! Each one wasn't too dry and two of them were sweet,   They also serve food from Cocokara if you get hungry! The service was very attentive and the owner was very welcoming!   I love the ambience here! this place really had a Japanese vibe going on and I loved it. I will be back soon!"}
