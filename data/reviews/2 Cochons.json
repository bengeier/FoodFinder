{"text":"I thought the sandwiches were ok... they were pretty hard. We also got the buns and only the lemongrass beef one was good. Wanted the duck banh mi but they were sold out. Don't get their bbt because I had a sip and threw mine out lol. Overall I would only come back if I was really craving banh mi and since this place is only 7 minute drive away, it isn't so bad but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Beau petit bijou qui a poussé récemment dans le quartier! Bons sandwiches variés, poutines qui mélangent terroir et saveurs exotiques (coréen, antillais, etc). S'apparente davantage à une sandwicherie et donc n'a que quelques places assises. Ils font la livraison. Super petite place qui a de l'avenir, je recommande!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat sadwiches \"Banh Mi\" very quickly, few tables and many choices.

Just need nicer light and nice music...

Just beside of St Michel subway."}
