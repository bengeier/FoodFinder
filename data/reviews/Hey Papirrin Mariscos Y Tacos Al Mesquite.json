{"text":"This place was terrible. The meat had no flavor and the salsa tasted like jar salsa. Overpriced. The server was very pushy as well."}
{"text":"Not horrible. Out of the 3 joints in the near by area I'll drive past this place and Salsitas and go to Jackie's. Every time."}
{"text":"Large menu selection. The lengua tacos are amazing!! Also the breakfast burritos you cannot go wrong with. Very good service."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint! The service is great, it's well priced and food is flavorful. I love that I can call my order in and just pick it up. Ask for their \"black salsa\" for any sea food...it's delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty average experience. I've had plenty of food truck food by now and this particular one falls right in the middle. My wife and I weren't blown away by the food, and the prices weren't as generous as others. I can say that the young girl taking orders and serving the food was kind. Aside from that, we aren't planning a special trip out to this quaint little place on the outer reaches of the west valley again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very great authentic Mexican food. Cow tongue taco was tender and tastes great. Ceviche was also awesome. Owners are very humble. Actual coke too!"}
{"text":"Very Very good Mexican food. First and foremost is their flour tortillas, they actually cook them! Meaning tortillas come packaged almost raw and require some cooking to get them browned but still pliable for burritos. Almost ALL the Mexican restaurants in Buckeye serve almost raw tortillas. 
Second, their cheese is the authentic \"queso quesadilla\" Mexican White cheese. This cheese melts perfectly in all of their dishes and it's not oily like the cheddar cheese Federico's, Ramiro's, La placita, Salcita's and Filiberto's use. 
$$$$ their AFFORDABLE menu is extremely extensive more so than the above mentioned restaurants. Service at a food truck?? You feel like you're in a regular restaurant maybe even better, the servers greet you as you walk under their covered area and take your order and before you know it your food is ready! Quality food, quality service and authentic Mexican food. Did I mention THEIR corn tortillas! Made on site fresh every day and better than you can imagine. Bravo Bravo \"Hey Papirrin\"

{"text":"I have been here 2 times and so far I have not been disappointed. I  ordered ceviche tostada and it was very good. The price was just right too. 3.00 for a couple small sized tostadas. Perfectly refreshing. Ceviche was fresh and authentic. You do get a lot of shrimp and just the right amount of vegetables. I did want to try the fish ceviche but they were out. Maybe next time. Oh I did happen to try a fish taco. If you are in the mood for a good fish taco try one here fish was not heavily battered. It was lightly coated and cooked on point. Again very fresh light and tasty. 3.00 can't beat that. With fresh home made tortilla.... mmm  mmm good. This is now my spot for some good mariscos. Will update more with future visits."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Finally we have some good Mexican food in Buckeye! Homemade authentic made to order dishes. They start you off with some chips n salsa made in house. Their Aguas frescas won't disappoint! Tacos are made with homemade tortillas, nuff said. 5 stars all day on the tostadas! 3.5 stars on the asada (slightly better than average). Do your self a favor and pass on anything \"bertos\" n give this place a try!"}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed!! The flour tortillas are delicious and this place is also very clean and the service is wonderful. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"This place is great number on here is incorrect for them, if you need to call there number is 623-853-9035! Love the breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Huge, filled burritos & quesadillas. Ordered an al pastor burrito, ham & egg burrito w/ beans & cheese, and asada quesadilla....and they did not skimp you on anything! Pastor & asado were served w/ a salad and limes. I was stuffed....which usually takes a lot for me. Lol Their pina juice was delicious! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was a regular for us. Almost every week we tried to make it out for a special treat for our little one. We're pretty picky on refried beans, they're a make or break for us when finding a Mexican restaurant. This place used to be spot on, worth their prices, but the last time we went I'm pretty sure the beans were canned beans.  no thanks! Too bad. We were becoming regulars."}
