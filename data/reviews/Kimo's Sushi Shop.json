{"text":"Wake up and go to Kimo's, people!   Kimo is from Hawaii and he used to be the chef at \"Century\",  the sushi bar at the Ritz Carlton. Now, he's got his own shop and it's the cutest thing ever. Very mom-n-pop style. You'll hear peaceful Hawaiian tunes in the background as you enjoy your meal. The food is awesome, and affordable. He's got fresh, delicious sushi rolls made to the highest standards. You can even order Hawaiian barbecue as a catered gig for large parties.   Kimo's was my favorite spot for some GOOD sushi when I lived in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is a little sushi restaurant in Ohio City. There are probably 3 or 4 tables in the whole place. The sushi is fresh, but limited selection. This is one of the few places when you can get Hawaiian food.  Its pretty good. The portions are huge for two. The hours are limited, but worthwhile. Parking is street. If it busy, you have to spend a few minutes to locate a good spot."}
{"text":"Good sushi in Cleveland is hard to find....  GOOD STUFF:  The Ritz Carlton used to have great sushi...if the other reviewer (Cheeky T.) is right that its the same sushi chef that's a definite plus.  I've been twice....both times really good sushi at fairly cheap prices.  Nice place too with good location in Ohio City.  Most importantly they let me BYOB which I absolutely love.  BAD STUFF:  I recently called there and they were closing early so turned me down for a take out order...worried that this place may not make it and you can't close down early when you're a restaurant....  PRICE:  fairly cheap especially if you go BYOB  OVERALL:  The best sushi place I have found so far in downtown or the west side of Cleveland.  BYOB if you ask nicely and really solid sushi.  Worried about the closing early thing...I hope they make it."}
