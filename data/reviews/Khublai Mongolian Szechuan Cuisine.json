{"text":"Decent food. Poor, unfriendly service. seemed irritated by the presence of kids and did not even offer us drinks.  Had only 2 highchairs in the whole restaurant and one had a broken seat belt. Will not be going back with my kids."}
{"text":"I've gone here on and off for a few years and have always had good service and amazing food. My last visit was yesterday, for dinner. I admit the price can be a little high, but considering how much food you get, it's worth it.  I was particularly impressed with the quality of the salmon, as well as the selection of ingredients. Everything was delicious and it was a lot of fun putting everything together.   My meal ended up costing $23, and I ate until I was stuffed and had plenty left over for lunch."}
{"text":"Way overpriced - no menu so therefore no  items prepared for you except for what you put together yourself. If you are not a chef or don't know what goes well together then you are not going to like Mongolian."}
{"text":"My major complaint is they don't put enough effort in their food.  Squid Ink Ramen: pretty nice flavors, but nowhere close to an authentic Japanese ramen. There was a Chinese spicy sauce, BBQ pork, and instant-noodle style ramen. Very confusing item for $14, which is wayyy overpriced.  Taiwanese popcorn chicken rice: This is the worst version ever. The flavors are wrong, and they dared serve a $10 plate with only the chicken and rice (no veggies on the side or anything!)"}
