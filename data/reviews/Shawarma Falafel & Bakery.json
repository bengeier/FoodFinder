{"text":"Absolutely delicious shawarma! All sauces and deserts are home made and are scrumptious! Definitely one of the best shawarma restaurants in Brampton. Very affordable prices, and portions are very generous. Definitely recommend to other shawarma lovers!"}
{"text":"Delicious every time, most hidden gem I've found in Brampton! The falafel and sauces are made in house and the veggies are super fresh. I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Chicken on sticks (aka shawarma chicken pieces and fries) as well as the chicken shawarma was very good. I have to commend the light, fluffy wrap as it was exceptional. Large portion of fries and chicken, was shared by 2. The wrap filling was equally generous. Definitely Worth the visit."}
{"text":"First time getting a chicken shawarma from this joint and it was delicious! 

The man taking our order was sweet and told us to call ahead of time so we don't have to wait in line if we're in a hurry. 

Ingredients tasted fresh and the sauce was pretty good. Not a bad place for affordable and yummy food. 


Would come back again! 

Tip: wouldn't really come here with a group of people as there are only 3-4 tables. Take out is just as good though!"}
{"text":"Not what was expected with the decent reviews. The food was pre cooked and the chicken was taken out of a container.. nothing fresh about it."}
