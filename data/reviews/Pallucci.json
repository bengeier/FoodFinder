{"text":"Small, yet cozy relaxing place.  I thought it was a bit small, so if you have a group of 8 friends gettin together for dinner, i dont think this is the best place for you.  Food was pretty good. A lil' on the pricey side- $32 for Tuna dish-a price in which the server failed to mentioned- or maybe t'was my fault not to ask, or was I even supposed to be asking for the price? err....  My friend had some meat dish for about $34.. Anyways, the service was nice- didnt have to wait 2 hrs for the foods to arrive, so that was good. Although, my tuna came out somewhat too salty, but the dinner rolls made up for it. Their thin-cut fries were amazing- reminded me of the way my grandma used to make fries for us- home fried french fries mmMMmmm   Will I go back? um---maybe. And i will be sure to order the foods w/ the prices are shown."}
{"text":"Pallucci is a quaint Italian restaurant located in the Mount Pleasant/Davisville area.  If you weren't a local, you probably wouldn't know it was here.  The decor is simple but modern and the servers are all very friendly.  The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance, with lit candles lining the rear wall.  Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests.     There is plenty of free street parking nearby - just one of the perks of being away from restaurants in the downtown core.  The menu has a good selection of Italian dishes.  I did fell however, that the entrées list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta.  The house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co. featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio).  These are both wines from the Niagara region, and I highly recommend them.  The server was even kind enough to bring over the bottle so we knew what it looked like before we head to the LCBO.  Wine purists may be scoffing at me, but I like hybrids!  The starter bread basket was warm, and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto.  For starters, it was warm.  It got a sprinkling of salted herbs and a dousing of balsamic vinegar.  It was hard not to devour the entire thing.  The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven.  We opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg, cherry tomatoes, red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big, and the salad itself was pretty bland.  The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts.  For mains I opted for the meat special, a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries).  I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour.  The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare, but unfortunately a bit lacking in the seasoning department.  The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up.  The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine, not too oily, and thin-cut just the way I like them.  I'd come here just to have these again.  My dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp. The tomato sauce was very fresh.  I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more.  The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish.  To finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7).  While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up, it was well worth the wait.   The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  The interior filling was dense and rich, with a raspberry centre.  Verdict:  The staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house.  They're warm, and serve you with a smile.  They were always around if you needed something, and quick to remove your plates when you've finished.  I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing.  The food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy, and is very fresh.  With that said, the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! I went here with my gf because she had a craving for risotto and I hear this restaurant made some good ones.  We started with the caprese salad and squid salad.  They were both excellent but the squid portion was a bit small. Still tasted fantastic.  Then she had a beef and mushroom risotto which was pretty damn good.  Dessert was also fantastic, the creme brûlée inside was custardy and the top crispy as it should be.  If you want good food they have it but my only issue was the lack of people, especially on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Came for dinner, $70 coupon clutched in hand. One server--the owner--coping with a growing crowd and doing very well. House wine is cheap and good, appetizers (warm funghi salad) excellent, but my steak frites was way overdone and piled atop what looked like frozen fries. My wife's pasta ($17) was, she said, very good. Our shared dessert--a lime tart--was excellent. So overall, pretty good."}
{"text":"What a gem!!  My husband and I LOVE Pallucci.  If you're lucky enough to get Chris (and most are) service is a 5+!  He knows his stuff, is happy to recommend, and sets a great pace for your meal.    Ambiance is cozy and comfortable - never too loud.    Food is excellent!  So much to recommend.  The sweet potato fries with balsamic glaze are a must.  The funghi salad is sooooo good, and my husband swears by the caprese with bocconcini.  Last time we went I had the tuna spacial and it was delicious!!  Everything is fresh and prepared to your liking.  This is a great neighborhood spot......give it a try!"}
