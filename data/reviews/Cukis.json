{"text":"They are still located on the corner of Blue Diamond & Decatur. Just one street south of Blue Diamond behind Dignity Health."}
{"text":"Really really good Mexican. The couple running it have been for a while and have been nothing but nice!  Been going her for a few years and this place deserves kudos. (Go early before they run out of carne asada). Their potato tacos are on point and are available till the run out. Almost hate to add this review as my secret spot may become too busy!!  That's all I'm sayin"}
{"text":"A religious experience! Seriously, if you are visiting or live in Vegas, the carne asada burrito and street tacos are the best in town. Lived in San Diego for years and Cukis is equivalent to the famous Los Cuatros Milpas in Barrio Logan-fresh food prepared with love!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this taco truck. The carnitas/asada/pastor tacos are delicious,... asada mulitas were super good also... Nice people working which is a bonus. This place is super busy during lunch time, so plan accordingly.... Check this taco truck out, best taco truck in town  I think.. decatur and blue diamond."}
{"text":"Located on Decatur and blue diamond.. On the side street.. Every time I crave for tacos I would stop by here to get at least 3 pastor tacos. That's my favorite, tried the beef but don't really like it. Kinda bland and chewy..

Tacos are $1.25 each..I haven't try anything else here beside the tacos..This food truck is always pack. Which means it's good, unlike the truck on the opposite street."}
{"text":"Super fresh and flavorful tacos. Al pastor was full spice and flavor but not greasy at all. Lengua was beefy and tender. Carne asada was lean and predictably bland for those with tamer taste buds; My 3 year old loved it though and ate two tacos before I even sat down. 4 salsas to choose from, all very different flavors and with varying heat levels. Next time will try the mulas and coctel de camarone - saw someone else order them when I was there and they looked awesome. 
Should be noted they have breakfast items and hamburgers, sandwiches, chips, sweets, drinks, etc available too."}
{"text":"Trust me when I say this is best taco truck on the south side of town. If someone knows of a better one please let me know! Don't play yourself and go to the red tack truck that is parked in the same location as Cukis. Cukis is 100 times better with essentially the same menu. Also don't be intimidated they speak both Spanish and English and are very friendly! Do yourself a favor and Grove then a try. My go-to is the carnitas burrito that is always very moist and flavorful and their avocado salsa is to die for!"}
{"text":"This little taco truck has become my latest addiction!

Cukis parks just south of the intersection of Decatur and Blue Diamond, behind the Hospital, from about 11AM to 2PM on weekdays

BRING CASH BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY TAKE! But I promise you won't regret it! 

Carne Asada Tacos; that's all I have to say. Carne Asada, Onion, Cilantro, Cheese, Corn Tortilla, side of Lime. These tacos are fucking heavenly...And they're so inexpensive! 

Cuki's also has way more than just tacos, but what are you waiting for? Stop reading this review and go indulge yourself!"}
{"text":"Just found this spot while dropping my son off at daycare. Seriously the best tacos I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Located on the south east corner of Decatur and Blue Diamond.  They open from 9-2pm Monday through Sat. This is the busier truck out of the 2. Had the grilled Tilapia tacos today. I would order them again! Ask for the grilled jalape√±os. They have 4 options for the salsa bar. All are great. Authentic food and nice staff."}
{"text":"Why am I giving it a one-star review? Isn't the food any good? I don't know, because the place isn't there! I can confirm that it isn't (reliably) at the location given during the hours specified. That makes this Yelp entry worse than worthless; it's misleading. If you're hungry and this comes up, don't drive there thinking you're going to find it."}
{"text":"Anyone know if they are still around? I tried twice and it is not there. For years we would go and it was on the east side of Decatur. Did it move? So sad not to see them, miss getting fish tacos....the best!"}
{"text":"I drove by hundreds of times. It's a Mexican catering truck close for construction workers and unemployed men looking for work. Needless to say I never felt the need to stop, especially since I'm not taking my chances with street food I have heard nothing about, I want to enjoy every meal. My husband is more adventurous for he began to frequent this place about maybe a year ago. One morning after dropping me off at work and tackling a horrendous hangover his usual cure, In N Out was not yet open. He made that left turn on Decatur and Blue Diamond towards Southern Highlands and there he decided to stop at Cukis in desperation! He was so pleasantly surprised. He would not stop talking about it. He got, as he said the most f****** delicious breakfast burrito ever!! He began to go at least twice a week. Sometimes before I was leaving for work in the morning.

     He started to bring me this shrimp cocktail, that I refused to eat along with everything else he got from there.  He would take my 6 year old there every morning, She would always get the quesadilla. They would sometimes eat it there. She loved it  there! He began to be well known there, they call him the \"Gringo\"!  Well i broke down and tasted his burrito (and yes it was very very good), and then the tacos also very tasty and fresh. but it wasn't until I had their shrimp cocktail was I so regretting not trying it!! They call it Cocktail de camarones, although I thought it was a ceviche. Whatever it is it's so so good. Fresh chunks of avocado, beautifully clean tasting tomato sauce, crisp tiny onions and wonderful seasonings and cilantro! It's s light yet so satisfying and healthy. I might be wrong but it really seems that they really take a lot of pride in making it!!

     So in conclusion, I had to share this and put this business on our Yelpy map for they really deserve it! By the way, I haven't personally stopped there myself but my husband tells me their clientele has changed a great deal. Sadly, he is not their only \"Gringo\" anymore and they are a lot busier. 

Sorry  I don't quite know the hours or days. I'm assuming they are open very early on weekdays and maybe they are done by 5."}
{"text":"best tacos in town.. hreay food for a great price.. the shrimp cocktails are on my list for next time"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place every day for a year and never stopped. What a mistake. Carne asade that tastes like Philly cheesesteak meat, melt-in-your-mouth braised pollo, sinfully greasy chorizo and earthy pastor tacos for $1.25 each - amazing. And four salsas to choose from including a green tomatillo that was legitimately spicy by my standards.

The best tacos come off trucks. Count on that."}
