{"text":"Some of us came from the distance and straight out of work, we travelled just to see the newly renovated, modern-looking food court at Yorkdale. We planned on visiting the first restaurant we saw, SU&SHI Noodle Bar. At the get-go, we were greeted by a loud shout of KONICHIWA by its staff, which echoed across the lavish space that lasted 10 seconds and slowly diminished until we were sat down. Our souls were slightly traumatized to say the least, but we were entertained simultaneously.  Instant food, the faster the better: Their service was quick (two thumbs up), and the food was great. The Ramen bowl had the width and depth of a grand canyon, the size was just perfect. Savoring the sushi pizza, which came in three bite-sizes were just as amazing.    I hypothesize that with intense rivalry of other great restaurants around the food court, SU&SHI Noodle Bar can survive alone in the intense theatre of competition."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at this restaurant. The bf and I were waiting to be served for over 10 minutes. Our server finally acknowledged us only to tell us she will be with us in a couple of minutes. I had ordered the sweet and sour chicken Japanese style and the rice was cold so was the chicken which was semi cold/warm (the portion is very small for the price). When I informed the waitress she told me she would warm it up, which she did.... In the microwave.  I had tried my boyfriends seafood ramen which we both agreed had little flavor.  We were both not impressed and don't plan on coming back.  Food: 1.5/5 (since my food was cold,ramen a bit tasteless) Atmosphere: 2/5 (it's very noisy) Service: 2/5  The atmosphere is noisy and it gives a cluttered vibe.."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls isn't really my thing so when my friend picked this place for lunch yesterday I wasn't totally enthused - wasn't bad though! The tempura veggies were a bit too oily but their black pearl sushi was good!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, I regretted that I had suggested to my family to come to this place. First of all, the waitress brought my food and my fiancée's not at the same time, so basically one was eating while the other ons was watching. Finally when we were about to leave I had only cash with me so I paid the full amount and like 6 % tip....guess what happened....the waitress slapped the bill on the table and threw some forks on the plate with very harsh attitude telling me she wants at least 15% tip.....I was so surprised...how rude...unbelievable...I just left....I felt attacked....man o man.....I'm still in shock about her attitude....the food was average and not even that close to OK....I had the 601 from their menu."}
{"text":"I was with some friends when we dined in here. It was good at first but then i don't know but i don't feel satisfied with their service. The server seems doesn't have any care. The way she talks to us wasn't really in an approachable or friendly type.  food was good anyways. But if ever i'm thinking of eating at Yorkdale, I'd rather have some foodcourt's foods."}
{"text":"On Black Friday, my friend and I decided to just have a quick lunch before heading back downstairs for more shopping.  I had a pretty good experience with Su & Shi at Square One and I know the Yorkdale location has been around for sometime. I thought I would give this location a try, but I was pretty disappointed.   I tried their bento box, which is pretty much like Manchu Wok where you pick a rice/noodle, a meat and a veggie. I tried their spinach noodle and it was horrible. All they did was toss it in a bit of oil, without any salt. The chicken wings were okay.  The worst part is the food did not come hot. It was lukewarm and by the time I got to my seat and had a couple bites, it felt like I was eating a salad.  My friend enjoyed their seafood udon, but I'm definitely not coming back for their bento boxes."}
{"text":"Cautious customers: you are walking into a very insidious place! The waitress there tried to trick me into paying double tips. Read your bills carefully people! The bill already included 15% gratuity then the credit card machine prompted you to tip on top of that amount. Also, when I first walked in,  it took them 10min to serve me water. The waiter waiting on tables across the aisle doesn't want to serve me because I'm not sitting in his zone. He just waved impatiently and asked me to wait for my waitress to come."}
{"text":"Funny enough, when I first came across this restaurant name in yorkdale mall, I was with a Japanese friend. He was surprised that a restaurant would be named vinegar and death. I thought this was funny! Anyways, I went here recently with said Japanese friend and we both had Ramen. I had the seafood Ramen and he had the chicken miso Ramen I believe. Overall, the food day average. Nothing exciting to stimulate the senses. The broth was sufficiently flavoured and the portion size was hearty. Our food arrived quite soon after ordering and was nice and hot.   Like I said, overall everything was OK. The flavours could be enhanced, but then again, this is a restaurant in a mall so it is what you would expect. I think next time I'll try the sushi."}
{"text":"Avoid coming here. Poor ramen and poor sushi! Thought we'd give this place a try because it was conveniently located in the mall. The prices are high but we figured it's gonna be worth it. Yikes! We were wrong. The soup is pretty tasteless, nothing like real milky pork broth like Kinton on Baldwin or even NYC's Ippudo. I had to douse my ramen with chili seasoning to add more taste. The sushi is also abysmal. Giant in size so lacks finesse of true sushi, the quality of fish was also subpar. We just didn't finish it because it was so bad. The service is spotty, ramen came fast and the sushi came a good 20 mins after which left for a disjointed meal. $50 for 2 ramen, 1 roll and a pop. I'm never coming again...."}
{"text":"We were at Yorkdale mall for some shopping and stopped at the food court to pick up some late lunch. Picked Su&Shi as we've never been there but it always looks packed so must be good.  The Sushi/Sashimi and Karaage we had were just okay, nothing special and not really mouth-watering but better than average.   The place itself is clean and the service was fast and crew polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Both my fiance and I are having stomach ache after eating at this place tonight! We ordered a Home Chili ramen and a BBQ Pork ramen. Taste was so so, we didn't expect good quality from a mall's foodcourt anyways. But serving food that are unclean / raw/ with bacteria are really unacceptable! Please avoid to go to this restaurant! Good that we didn't try their sushi or else we will be in the hospital now!"}
{"text":"Don't call yourself a noodle house if you can't make a decent noodle bowl.   Ordered the house noodle, soup base taste just like water with some salt, the meat is very chewy, or too chewy for a Japanese BBQ pork standard. And it comes one of the most important part of the bowl, the noodle... they were bundled together due to moisture before cooking.  The most disappointing noodle bowl ever. A home made instant noodle bowl would be much better than this. And they are charging you $11 for this thing. No wonder they can keep opening more stores.   If you really want a good noodle bowl, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst place to have ramen, it's like what I can cook at home...or even worse..."}
{"text":"I know that this is just an eatery in a food court base environment. But service here needs to be improved. I can see a guy working hard to serve the tables or customer outside his service area. But there were 2 waitresses that blanket ignore me when I was prepared to order. This is offensive to customers and put-off. Lucky for me the waitress servicing the section is good and polite. So to the rest of the team and the manager on the floor, you need to look at your service and do the best for your team."}
{"text":"The ramen is mediocre. In fact I can make better ramen out of instant noodles by Nissin.  The chicken in the ramen is made of rubber.  Yes, it is that bad."}
{"text":"Prices quite decent (especially at end of day), quality very decent, customer service reasonable.  M'lady and I passed via the stand at the outside of this restaurant, where they were advertising that their sushi was from my recollection 30% off as per of their end of day sale. They were also filling containers with their different dishes, and pricing them very attractively. We ended up getting 1 sushi container, and 1 of the animal meat & condiments container.  I quite enjoyed the sushi, as well as the other container we shared, where even though it was end of the day, the food was very fresh and delicious.  I'd definitely come back for a meal at this venue in the future."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister, we shared 3 items: 1) Seaweed salad-$4 Was as expected- normal seaweed salad- they don't try to skimp by adding lettuce to the bottom and seaweed salad on top, like some sushi restaurants 2) Salmon and ginger sushi- $12 This came with only 4 pieces for the $12 (that's $3 per piece for those of you bad at math). The Maki was wrapped with salmon instead of rice and had an extremely large dollop of mayo on top. It looks like too much mayo but these rolls were delicious. Great unexpected use of flavours. Not worth the price. 3) Sweet potato tempura sushi with mango and cucumber-$12 Also was an interesting and delicious combination of flavours. HOWEVER- These rolls were GIGANTIC. There is no possible way ANYONE could ever fit the whole thing in their mouth in 1 bite. Not possible. We had a lot of laughs trying to eat these (with chop sticks, forks, and hands- all of which was very un graceful and flat out messy). YouTube-ing videos of people eating extremely large sushi ensued. Not worth the price. All-in-all I would never go back here, and I haven't said that about very many restaurants. The flavours are interesting, but the sushi is not particularly fresh or high quality for the price. Plus, who wants to eat fist sized sushi? Not I."}
{"text":"I would like to rate the service separately as a 5-star because our server was so nice.  As for their ramen, I completely agree with Jennifer K's review. The House chili ramen was not spicy at all and the ingredients were confusing. There was chicken, spinach, bean sprouts, shrimp tempura and really thick and tough Chinese BBQ-ish pork. I couldn't even chew through it. The chefs were speaking Cantonese so I'm guessing this is a Hong Kong run ramen place. I don't suggest this place at all if you're looking for authenticity.  I asked my server what kind of pork was used and she apologized advising that the pork is sometimes thin and sometimes thick. So basically pretty inconsistent food.  The manager offered us complimentary dessert after I brought the poor quality of their ramen to their attention. I think I'm doing them a favor by letting them know.   My friend gives his chicken curry katsu a 3-star. The rice was authentic Japanese rice, the curry was thick but not enough was given and the chicken was very tender. The portions are very small for the price.   Food and service combined, I'd give this place a 2.5 star.   P.S - don't expect your food to arrive at the same time either. My friends rice was cold by the time my ramen arrived.   Overall a big disappointment for a such nicely decorated place."}
{"text":"Went to Yorkdale Mall to kill time with my dad and I told him he just HAD to see the new food court. I haven't been to the mall in nearly 2 years and I went to it twice in a week. Anyways, he wanted to just pick up a few trays but I wanted to sit in, so I suckered him into it and it was a very enjoyable experience.  Cute and attentive servers. Delicious food in huge portions.  I love the design of the restaurant, sleek, modern, and cosy. (all the way up there, kind feels like a bird's nest).  I got the Seafood Ramen and My dad got the B combo (various sashimi, sushi and a roll). We had a hard time finishing our plates.  I'm going back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Takes a long time for your food to get to you. You have to ask to be served. After I ordered my meal I wanted it to go and they threw it out. They don't care. Don't waste your money or time"}
{"text":"Have to say, really had a fantastic waitress...I believe her name was Mai or May. Super friendly, checked up on us and was eager to help. She deserves 5 stars just for that.  But this place sucks. When it's busy, you have to compete with mountains of shopping bags and coats. People take chairs to put their things on which means not enough chairs. Space is tight.   My fiancé and I felt like sushi and decided to try this place. We were brought to a corner table for two but one of the stools was used for a bag by another table. Than another man started cleaning out a table meant for 6 and gave us a speech about how normally this table is reserved for 4 people or more blah...listen buddy, either ask the other table to give up their stool or shush. We just wanted to eat (I was HANGRY!)  Food is cheap. Sashimi is cheap. Quality is Walmart-grade. Portions are huge though - this one table ordered some rice or ramen dish...the size of that bowl was like that of a toilet bowl for potty training. And I think for $8-9 bucks.  The man at the \"kitchen\" kept on coughing...nice sprinkle of germs with our food.  Wouldn't recommend this place. If you really want sushi, make the drive out. If you are really hungry, really, there are so many other better options."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the negative reviews of this restaurant as I had a great lunch here today.  We had passed this many times while on the way up to the yorkdale food court because I assumed it would be overpriced and can't compare to the many options I frequent in Markham.  I was pleasantly surprised!! This will be my go to lunch spot in yorkdale from now on.  Food:  - Sushi sashimi combo A was $16.99.  2 pcs each of salmon, eel, butterfish sushi, a salmon advocado hand roll, and a few pieces sashimi.  This one was a bit overpriced, I think they can include better sashimi or sushi for this price. - Tuna poke bowl was $12.99, this was good value.  Portion size was bigger than the photo looked, it was impressively yummy with a mixture of seaweed salad, ample tuna pieces, advocado, cucumber, rice, etc. and the sauce was delicious.  Really enjoyed this dish and hope they keep up the quality and portion as I will be back to try the Salmon poke bowl and Ramen next time.  Service: food came fast, we arrived 11:30 so no issues with getting seated right away for lunch either.  Place: great sit down spot for lunch or dinner before or after shopping.  Much preferred than looking for a foodcourt spot when it gets busy.   Would definitely recommend their poke bowls, and I'd expect the sushi burrito to be just as good."}
{"text":"Most of the servers are super nice and pretty young so they're all cool too.  Now the foods pretty good especially for food court quality. I recommend looking for torched mini salmon, tom yum soup and Moscow or submarine roll. Also the new bento boxes are awesome and will fill you up. But honestly you can't go wrong with most of the stuff there. The servers are always honest and will let you know how they feel about everything.  The absolute best part is the alcohol. You can get a large can of Sapporo for 7.99$. GET THE ALCOHOL. And don't forget to tip these cool servers at least 15%"}
{"text":"They are operated by Spring Rolls. I had their House Ramen and the meat is similar to Vietnamese style grill meat. Noodles are pretty good."}
{"text":"My experience here was a pretty pleasant surprise since I came in with extremely low expectations. I chose to stay away from the ramen cause I was sure they would be unable to meet the high expectations downtown ramen joints have set. So, I ordered the mini unagi don and was pleased to find that the eel didn't have that gross taste you get when the eel is not prepared right. However, I did find that the eel was a bit on the cold side, probably because it was also meant to be used to make sushi. I was also happy with the portioning, because I was concerned that I wouldn't be full with a \"mini\" don. When I got my order though, I saw that the word 'mini' is debatable in describing the dish since I was more than full when I finished it (keep in mind though that I ate this for lunch, when my appetite is substantially smaller). In addition service was quite excellent, as if I was in an actual restaurant! Overall, it's not fair to judge this place from a restaurant stand point b/c at the end of the day it's more like a cross over b/w food court and fast food restaurant. With that in mind then my high score is more justifiable. I was also surprised that it was affiliated with Spring Rolls, which in my opinion has always butchered Asian food and charged a ridiculously high price for it. This place however is ok in books. More like a solid 3.5."}
{"text":"well seems like we don't have many options at Yorkdale.  I don't think the soup is really made of chicken/pork as they said. Too salty, makes me want to drink lots of water after.  Meat portion was fine, chile ramen came with pork chicken and tempura shrimp."}
{"text":"Overall great service and ambiance. However, the food is kinda average. My boyfriend and I ordered the kalbi bento and red dragon roll. The presentation was pretty but the food was ok, definitely had better sushi elsewhere at a much more affordable price."}
{"text":"Overall ...meh. The food was really really bland. I wish I had ordered the sushi! A friend and I ordered the chicken and shrimp teriyaki with rice, and the avocado rolls, and everything just tasted like it had absolutely no seasoning or flavour. We weren't too impressed with the service either, as the staff cleared our table of soy sauce (my only option for added flavour) and water glasses mid way through our meal. I get that they were closing in an hour, but really....I think paying customers should be able to finish their meal with the same treatment provided to other customers who came a bit earlier in the day. Won't be back, at least not unless to try something new! I was actually more disappointed finding out that this is owned by Spring Rolls. Do better!"}
{"text":"Best sushi i think I've ever had!! came with a friend for lunch on Thursday. Got the only two vegetarian sushi options & they were so amazing. The staff was friendly and very observant. Price is very average. I would 100% recommend this place"}
{"text":"Bad and slow service. Over priced food (felt like CN Tower/Trump prices) for small portions - especially the sushi. Appetizers took forever to come. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Colour me surprised.   I usually avoid Spring Rolls like the plague. I generally find their pseudo-Asian food expensive and offensively incorrect. But I was really really craving noodles in soup and sushi and I just couldn't let that go. I passed by a lady eating a bowl of ramen that looked pretty tasty so I took the plunge.  It's still expensive ($18 for a bowl of chicken ramen and 6 avocado rolls) but it was surprisingly good. The ramen had a good bite to it, the broth was tasty and the chicken was fresh and moist. The sushi was nothing amazing, but it was decent. It took a while to get my order, which kind of annoyed me since I was getting takeout, but I was happy with the meal in the end."}
{"text":"Didn't try the sushi but their noodles are worth the visit.   Ordered house ramen.  Noodles tender and not too chewy, meat portion just right. Soup light is refreshing, servers are awesome. The presentation was the best I've seen.  Price was a little steep, though."}
{"text":"This is a convenient spot to rest your feet after a day of shopping.  The servers are very pleasing and prompt.  I had the steamed BBQ buns and I quite enjoyed it. They also served a wonderful cup of ginger tea.  I even requested a cup of it to go and they gave it to me at no charge.   However, the tempura noodle soup was quite bland.  It tasted very watered down and quite cold by the time it was served to me.  I will probably try to order something else in the future and give this place another try.  The decor is quite cheerful and well thought of."}
{"text":"Pretty average Chinese food: $7.90 with tax for combo #1 which is a side with noodles or rice. The dish is hot but could be much tastier. The sweet and sour pork was mostly the breading flour around it and the noodles were bland. Service was fast because it was pretty empty, but this is just their fast food side not their dine in restaurant. So, I will try their sushi and ramen in the future!"}
{"text":"Su&Shi is a pretty nice place. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Food ordered comes quite quickly. The portions of Ramen, sushi roll, and house salad were quite large so I was pleased I got my money's worth. However the tempura and tornado roll are a bit pricey compared to other sushi restaurants. The food itself was pretty much what you'd expect from any fast food sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow that was bad. Across the board it was horrible. The restaurant was messy at noon.   Sushi was day old fish and imitation crab (they were at least honest on the menu that is fake crab), rice made without rice vinegar, spicy mayo that wasn't spicy but the presentation was great.  Noodle dish was beyond bland and was piss poor. After one bite I could already name three different ingredients that would make the meal acceptable.  Servers were beyond disinterested and didn't care about improving our meal at all. For some reason they were mad when I only left 10%, something about only coming to my table once and not properly clearing it made them feel entitled to 15% or more I suppose.  The real kicker is that the owner/management was sitting in the corner eating food from another restaurant with someone else, but had it plated to hide their obvious shame of crappy food.  Management should feel more than happy to contact me"}
{"text":"It's decent. It's nice to be able to sit in a quite non-food court like area overlooking the mall. When it's busy, I find the ceilings too low in the food court, making it dark and dingy. I like the idea of having a meal in a 'restaurant' per say.   They have table service but don't expect much.   The menu has some ramen, and appetizers from what I remember. There were also specials like sushi but they didn't look appetizing.    The ramen was okay, but not as flavourful as some of the other downtown ramen places. No flavour also means no MSG. The broth was watery and almost tasteless. We also got the crispy fried noodles (basically cantonese fried mein). Really basic stuff $8-10 each.  Also got a gyoza which was terrible. Too much dough, and not crispy enough on the bottom.   Overall, i'd come back for ramen in the mall, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I had the house spicy ramen and it was sooooo bad. The broth barely had any flavour. Noodles were definitely undercooked. I knew this because some were still bunched up together. The instant noodles I cook at home is better. Never again."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! I was skeptical at first because of the reviews on yelp but when taking a view at their menu; it looked promising. Su&Shi also has their own designated area for seating so my friend and I preferred that over the food court space where it was extremely packed.   They have a large assortment of food to pick from but  I was contemplating between the beef ramen (as everyone had some type of ramen when I looked around) or the pork curry. I decided to go with the curry and I was happy with my choice.  PORK CURRY: for the price (~$12), i thought it was worth it! They gave a lot of rice and extra curry on the side. The curry itself isn't overly packed with flavour but was enough and was creamy. Do you ever eat curry where the flavour is so intense your nose begins to water, or you have to take a break? It's not like that with this one. The dish also includes cucumbers, tomatoes, an egg, and cabbage. In addition, the pork is crispy and pairs well with the rice and curry.  I would definitely come here for lunch again!"}
{"text":"I decided to try the ramen at this place because I figured they would specialize in noodles since they are called \"noodle bar\" but it was not what I expected. Service and ambience was decent for an asian place but the food was mediocre. I ordered the house chili ramen and the broth was bland, bbq pork was overcooked/hard to chew and the chicken just didn't taste right. I would not recommend the ramen noodle if you're a ramen lover like me but hey you can't have high expectations for a restaurant in a food court."}
{"text":"This is a spin-off of Spring Rolls, which I am a big fan of.    I've been here twice, just because we happen to be shopping at Yorkdale Mall.    Closest thing to Asian food in the food court. I remember trying the black pearl roll, grilled Japanese sirloin with rice and the house ramen.  The black pearl roll - its acceptable, but the ramen for over $10 is a bit of a rip off.  It didn't taste homemade and was bland.  However, the Japanese sirloin is decent and tastes good.  Not somewhere I would visit again unless I'm \"forced to:\""}
{"text":"Their ramen and sushi are not very authentic and tastes bland. Expensive for what it is. Also can be difficult to get quick service.  The location is convenient when you are feeling like noodles at Yorkdale. They are located to the right as soon as you get up to the Dine on 3 foodcourt.  They do get points for offering a movie and meal deal. But give adequate time to eat here if you want to make it to your movie on time!"}
{"text":"1 Ticket for the movies + appetizer in here $19.99  1 huge sapporo + 3 appetizers $12 something  We were on the mall after a Sephora scale, without coffee, breakfast, or anything else but a spoon of olive oil with lemon in our empty stomachs. So, while passing through the electric steps that point towards the food court, I guess the smell of food invaded Mateo and he asked me if we should grab some food and leave grocery shopping for tomorrow...   We jumped on the electric stairs thinking where to go eat; I suggested to go look around the fast food but Mateo mentioned in the entrance of this place that in there we could get a cold beer... I just followed hm with the konnichiwa greating while we were entering.  This day I finally felted the Spring, so I wasn't in the mood for sweating more in a soup. We ordered calamari, salmon salad, and Mateo ordered a spicy ramen.  Everything was average but the size of those sapporos...  I mean, if you are waiting for the movies, loosing time, or you want a neutral place to hook up with someone unknown, this place is open; dynamic; convenient; loud; and if you don't like your date, the washrooms are far away, so you can run...  I love the sealing of this spot with all those red flowers, reminded me one of those beautiful Kenzo commercials."}
{"text":"It is a decent food court setting sushi and noodle joint.   I've grabbed food on the go there, multiple times in the past, and usually when I'm at Yorkdale and in a hurry, I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel, and just head over to Su&shi."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch,ordered house ramen,fried calamari,everything seems to be ok but there's hair in my calamari and not my hair coz i have blonde long hair, and the hair is inside the batter, they should wear hair net when in the kitchen.. and the last time i bought calamari from them it wasn't fresh,kinda rubbery..like come on your restaurant is in a very descent location which is yorkdale mall,service and food quality should be good..."}
{"text":"Here is my take on the restaurant:  Pros - friendly staff, made you feel welcome. Decor is very pretty and modern - loving those red flowers on the ceiling! The ramen bowls are a plus. The dishes themselves are good too, though they're pretty much like any other dishes at a Japanese fusion restaurant.  Cons - it can get really busy and you'll have to wait a while for your seat. Service can be slow at times.   Would I recommend this place? Yes, but come only when you know it's not going to get busy and come for the ramen."}
{"text":"I'm not a Spring Rolls fan by any imagination...i actually avoid them. However, i have to say that this version is surprisingly good. They were very accommodating as the specifications were rattled off.....ramen with udon noodles instead, sauce with no fish or any meat or egg......spicy enough to burn the roof off. My usual basically, i was really craving the soup. My friend ordered the chicken non spicy version of my order and veg Tempura. Tempura was light and varied, the noodle soup was fantastic. Huge portion and we both finished our bowls that is how good it was. The wait staff was very attentive and chatty, took the window view, which was really nice. The price was very reasonable considering we also ordered dessert(less than $50)(spent more at Japango on just a few Salmon rolls and one udon soup).....pass on the tempura cheesecake, but the fried bananas is always a yes. My only surprise was that my green tea was a teabag.  Next time I'm craving noodle soup and have some spare cash, definitely going to Yorkdake Su&Shi noodle bar."}
{"text":"Headed to the food court for lunch while at Yorkdale on a Monday and walked around but ended up coming back. It is located right at the front of the food court on your right as you get off the escalator. There is a takeout counter at the front and seating inside. The restaurant was modern, bright and clean. I wasn't expecting much in the way of food and just wanted something quick and filling. It wasn't very busy and the service was good. I ordered the house ramen combo with karaage chicken. The ramen came with bbq pork, chicken, tempura shrimp, bean sprouts, chinese greens and corn. The soup can be done regular or spicy. It was tasty, the noodles slightly chewy and I enjoyed the spicy soup. The karaage was just ok and comes with a side of spicy mayo and a lemon chicken wedge. If you're at Yorkdale and want a quick meal and feel like Japanese do stop by, an average food court offering."}
{"text":"worst service ever. We went there at 5-6pm on saturday. food was okay. but the waitress who served our table was very very rude. she served our food to other table. seems like they don't care about hygiene of the restaurant. cuz we didnt satisfied with their services, so i gave her 10% of tip and then she looked daggers at me and threw  receipt to us. i will never ever go there again. I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone!! !!!!!!!!I hope i can give zero star."}
{"text":"Bought a box of spicy california roll here - it was hard and tasteless. Even supermarkets make better sushi. Sorry to say but I will not be back."}
{"text":"Gross. I was in a mall and had a sushi craving. I wasn't expecting quality, but was surprised to see such high price points (rolls range from $12-15, so you're looking at about $30). Compared to other restaurants in this price range this one is a total fail. Compared to mall sushi in general, still a fail. The sashimi arrived in oddly shaped blocks that were too chilled. Also they seem to treat their fish with something that dries out some of the moisture and kills the flavour. The roll was awful.... too much rice and totally the wrong texture. Don't make the same mistake.... save your money and grab a fast food burger instead."}
{"text":"Overpriced, Chinese food. Got their chili chicken bento box and sweet and sour bento box. Shrimp tempura batter was thick and soggy. Food is not served hot. Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Ramen was OK, but server was rude and service was terrible. It took forever to get seated, served and then get the bill. Portions are relatively large though."}
{"text":"The soup was bland. The noodles were lacking the chewiness it should have. The only really positive thing I could say is that the seafood ramen came with a generous portion of mixed seafood and was fresh. Service was also pretty good."}
{"text":"Wow, did they do something to their recipe recently? I came here for lunch with my family and we all got different bowls of ramen and they were all really really good. Like, the soup was perfectly hot and flavourful kinda good. And the seafood ramen was loaded with toppings. And the bbq pork ramen was overflowing with bbq pork which were fatty and tender and sooooo gooood! If I recall, it was like 5 or 6 pieces compared with 1-3 that you get at other ramen places.  I also love the added bean sprouts and the corn in my soup. The ramen is priced at around $10-12 each and it was so yummy and filling. I'd totally give them a try if you haven't recently. I can't say it if it was fluke because I wasn't very impressed previously but my last visit made me a fan. It's definitely high quality fast food."}
{"text":"I am quite surprise to read the other reviews.   Now, that restaurant is inside a food court therefore, you shouldn't have crazy high expectations. It is not an upscale sushi place but it hits the spot.   My boyfriend and I went there for a quick dinner while shopping at Yorkdale. They had a promotion which is 12.99$ for sake or beer, plus three tapas.   The fried calamari had a great taste to it and was well seasoned but wasn't crispy enough. The vegetable tempura was the complete opposite: bland but very crispy.   The sushi rolls are absolutely delicious and the salmon is extremely fresh. I personally didn't like the red tuna as it tastes like it has been frozen before.   Overall, a good place if you're craving sushi while shopping."}
{"text":"It was not bad for a restaurant/food court type of deal sushi. Combos were good. Decent mall food. Not a melt in your mouth but something you'd go again for mall food"}
{"text":"I got the beef ramen, and it was meh. I've had way better for cheaper downtown. The soup base didn't taste authentic, but the portions were large which I guess is a plus if you're really hungry. My boyfriend did like his seafood ramen soup. It's more spicy and adds better flavour. Overall, it reflects spring roll. Asian fusion food for the masses, but not the place to go if you want authentic Chinese food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Over priced and poor quality.   I was not impressed by this place at all.  I thought it would be better than what it was, simply because it's in the Dine3 section of Yorkdale.  Maybe my first mistake was ordering sushi.  It looks like this place is more known for it's ramen.  If I ever try this place again I'll go with that instead.   I had the sushi combo A - which came with sushi and sashimi (mostly salmon). Sushi was ok however when I have to pick out bones, that is when I get annoyed.  I've had WAY better sushi. To top it all off - for 2 combos it came to $41. no miso soup, no salad, no complimentary tea.  Totally overpriced for what you get.   I probably won't be revisiting."}
{"text":"In the busiest mall you'd often pass by this gem of a Resturant. But... You SHOULDN'T! Take a break from shopping and sit and relax! The menu is pretty extensive for a food court and reasonably priced. I don't recall the name of our waitress by she was a RAY OF SUNSHINE.... Energetic, outgoing so sweet and knowledgeable. The food is 10/10. Any noodle dish you get will be the bomb.com and the fish is FRESH!!! My new go to."}
{"text":"We came here close to closing time, but they were so busy, I walked to the other side of the Dine on 3, go to washroom, come back BEFORE they take our order. Within seconds after the server left, she came back to tell us it is last call. No problem. Food arrived, my wife's Miso Soup was lukewarm at best, Noodle was barely cooked, and 70% of the BBQ Pork was fat. The saving grace was the egg and the tempura shrimp. My Chicken Tokyo Mee Noodle....sauce was runny and under seasoned, and the vegetable was undercooked. The saving grace was that the Noodle was actually crispy without being burnt. We used to really like this place, but....yes, you can argue they are closing, but should not the first dish just as good as the last one?"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve half a star. If you are hungry while shopping at Yorkdale, stay the hell away from this restaurant, save yourself."}
{"text":"I was a little worried when I saw the 2.5 rating on yelp but was convinced to go anyway. We waited around for more than 5 minutes and no one came by. We left."}
{"text":"Went in today for a meal (dinner) seen a deal for the movie. So i had the chicken soup meal. It came with a salad.   Staff very nie and friendly no complaints. Setted right away!  FOOD:  Postive It was served up hot which is a Pluse for me.  Big amount looks fresh I got the Pop and the staff seen it empty and they kept refilling or asking! This i like!   Negitive  -Salad was over dressed I would ask for it on the side -Main dish: seams like its pre set up casue it came out really fast. Perhpas its cause only 5 people in the place at the time i was their. (not sure)  -Why did the meal not come with a dresert? Most other places do the samething and it comes with it!! I would strongly recoment it!  Over all its a ok place to go. Would i go back in a group so you could try other dishes.   A bit over price i think but with the move deal its about the same all over the place!"}
{"text":"Presentation of the Pork Ramen looks good but the taste is disappointing.  The soup is watery and flavorless, the texture of the noodle is mushy and the pork is too fatty.  Takoyaki (Octopus Balls) is smaller than usual, with tiny amount of octopus inside. The taste is ok, but the portion is unsatisfying.  Overall the food is what you would expect from a mall food court."}
{"text":"Su &Shi is in the Dine On 3 food court @ Yorkdale Shopping Centre. Food court's always crowded so hard to find seats but this is a good little sushi & bento noodle bar. Enjoyed Rainbow Roll (why only one soy sauce pkg though? There should be 2), seaweed salad (generous serving) & something new: canned Pokka Jasmine Green Tea (Nice!) Over all, good fresh Japanese lunch takeout."}
{"text":"My friend was visiting from BC and she really wanted to go to the Cheesecake factory. It was already 8pm and we were told that it would be almost a 3 hour wait so we came upstairs to Su&Shi for dinner.   I didn't mind Su&Shi because I was a huge fan of their ramen and their specialty rolls. I always get the same thing, the chilli ramen. For some reason, my ramen was just warm. Not even hot. I love my soup to be piping hot especially when it was super freezing outside. It kinda bothered me how my soup was warm but I didn't complain because we were starving.   This place is okay for a quick fix but I have tried better ramen in the area. Maybe it was just that day or that we ordered late? I can't really justify why. It's still a good place to eat at."}
{"text":"The fried meat here is definitely old and poor quality. I had kalbi ramen spicy miso and it was great. Noodles just right and broth pretty flavourful. Good option for mall food. Sushi - we had green dragon good, salmon sashimi just alright. Would retune again for ramen."}
{"text":"Had the house ramen :) Was yummy. Not too long of a wait. Service and prices weren't amazing, but they were okayyy."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst sushi and food I have had in Toronto.  The food was bland and tasted old.  They also had little black flies flying all over the restaurant. Gross!!! I'd never go back!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto with friends for Caribana and our hotel was across the street. Anyway I'm a huge lover of all things noodle and especially when it has eggs, chicken and all those other amazing veggies in it (drooling ).   This is a very cool spot and looks very authentic to be in a mall. I don't do the pre made food that sits in a window so I was excited to find this gem. The staff was very nice and from what the locals tell me the sushi is fresh and amazing. NOTE this place should rename themselves \"Amazing Eats\"   Anyway check out this spot, good food."}
{"text":"2.75 Star?   Was my Chili Ramen ($10.99) a really good ramen??   Not really... The soup has not much taste to it and usually how I complain about broth being salty, not happening here!   The bbq pork though is really dry and does taste more like a \"Chinese\" BBQ pork more than the Japanese version.. but I guess this is an \"Asian Fusion\" restaurant?   The shrimp tempura just looks a little sad... Chopstick look a like....  The noodle though cooked al dente with a good bite... If they would not improve the other aspect of the ramen itself, it will be quite decent!  The deco is nice, service is fast...  I might be back, but Dine on 3 does have other places I want to try!!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, and my boyfriend and I really loved it!  He ordered a Spicy Tuna Poke Bowl, and oh my, it was SO good! Super fresh, and a huge portion.  I ordered a Bento Box that came with Sweet and Sour Chicken, Steamed Rice, 2 pieces of Salmon Sushi, Green & Seaweed Salad, and 2 Shrimp Tempura.. and I thought it was delicious! Great portion sizes, and the prices were good too.  We sat down in the restaurant and had great service as well.   We saw many other patrons eating the soup, so it looks at though that's a really popular option.   Would definitely eat here again, and even have the same meal! It was that good!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, def not authentic. The Gyoza was massive and the texture was off. The rolls were also very large and chewy. The best part of our meal was the fried cheesecake. It was awesome!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here with no expectations but surprisingly the food are good. The only problem is no place for jackets, there are only a few coat hangers."}
{"text":"There are times when I feel a meal is satisfying and plentiful, this was not one of those times. The service was slow despite it not being busy. Appetizers alone took well over 20 minutes. I was not impressed with their serving size and their snobby attitude."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday with family for lunch.  Waited in line for a bit for a group of 3 so that wasn't too bad.   Quality of the food was not up to par.  We had a ramen in which the soup was warm at best. When we complained to the server he have us attitude and was not helpful at all.  The teriyaki beef dish was average, it had too much sauce in it.   The place is understaffed with servers who don't care."}
{"text":"For mall sushi, it is hard to do better.  The sashimi is very fresh, and the options are well priced.  I particularly like the seaweed salad, the portion is extremely generous.    On the downside, for inexplicable reasons (its not like they are that busy), they rush you like they have to get to a wedding.  The second you are done a plate, it is taken away and your bill appears.  If you don't pay the second after it is given, they hover until you do.  This with hours to closing.  Very odd."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance and not much has changed. Just another bastardization of asian cuisine brought to you by spring rolls. If you have never tried ramen this is an unfair judgement of what ramen should taste like.   Firstly the salty and need for water consumption after having a bowl of ramen signifies MSG. A soft boiled egg becomes a full boiled egg; hardly traditional. The broth is definitely made from MSG powder and the noodles.. Ive had better noodles out of a bag of instant noodles than what they called ramen.   The meats are bland and tasteless I would of expected more from a place using MSG. If it is a ramen noodle bar and the BBQ Pork isnt one of the top dog noodles then you went to the wrong place. Lets say in all my years of eating BBQ Pork whether chinese bbq style or japenese bbq style never once was it over cooked, no bbq flavor or even pork flavor for that matter, and hard to chew. Despite the fassade that spring rolls tries to pull over everyones eyes this place is far from asian food more like the countless chicken ball serving restaurants claiming to be serving asian cuisine.   Leave it to a real asian to review asian food cause everyone claiming this to be legit has got to give their head a shake. Starting at $11.99/bowl and having tom yum ramen as one of the popular eats gives you a clear indication of what this place is like. Over priced fake asian food, even for food court standards."}
