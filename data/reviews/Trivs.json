{"text":"Great dinner.  Had filet and prime rib. Great service. Will definitely be back again. Loved the happy hour drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Great lunch, great service...I was in from out of town, this was a suggestion of a customer and I will definitely be back.  Not easy to spot from the road but don't let that deter you; great menu, daily specials, everything made fresh and outdoor patio seating available."}
{"text":"Utterly Shambolic!!

Recently listed on a must try list for Strongsville, my family tried Trivs for the first time tonight. Service was slow, food was bad to just ok, bus boys were rushing us...it was awful!  My shrimp were burnt on my first plate, but the pasta was pretty good. Sent my plate back because of the inedible shrimp. My second plate had over done shrimp, but edible however the sauce on the pasta was truly inedible. I wish I'd been able to keep my first plate! My husband was waiting for me to get my replacement plate of food when a bus boy came by and asked if he needed a box. Then when I pushed aside my inedible pasta and finished the last three bites of my husband's food...I didn't even have my fork pulled from my mouth before that same bus boy was trying to pull the plate out from under me. When I said please let me at least put my fork down he had the nerve to be offended I'd said no!

Finally, the place is frankly way too small for live music...it was too loud in there! My son's steak was just ok. And for what would have been a $75+ meal for three people (no alcohol) but was $25 less because my twice received inedible meal was comp'd...id have expected a better meal, better service and not to have waited nearly an hour for burned shrimp. 

Avoid this place...I don't see why anyone would have recommended it. Strongsville has better food and service and certainly better value for your dinners out."}
{"text":"Very few places put out delicious food with such consistency. The ribeye I've had twice now, and it's one of the best stakes I've ever had in my life. No joke, and the sides that accompany it are some of the best  renditions of their kind (scalped potatoes and Brussel sprouts with pancetta) . To top it all off, is the best creme brule I've tried yet. All this at a better price then your chain steakhouses, makes it a tremendous value. Hats off to you chef."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a new job and Trivs staff and atmosphere made us feel like we were celebrating with family. The calamari is the best we've had outside of New Orleans and entrees were nothing short of amazing. If you are looking for hospitality done right, Trivs is the place. Thanks Trivs!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Strongsville.  I was pleasantly surprised by the outstanding quality of the good and service given the understated location.

This is a restaurant that features high quality food in a very unassuming local.  

They offer a good variety on the menu inclusive of steak, seafood, and pasta. 

I had the ribeye and was provided with a truly 1st class steak in a great atmosphere.

The highlight was sitting at the bar and being served by an extremely engaging and professional Angeline Jolie look alike.  A truly exquisite bartender with both beautiful looks and charm by the name of Jessica.  What a joy to find such a treasure in Ohio let alone Strongsville."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I thoroughly enjoy this place. We usually come in for their happy hour. Good drinks and awesome appetizers make this a unique happy hour place. I believe happy hour is from 11-7, which in real life America is convenient. Most places are usually until 4 or 5 which most people are still working... Unless I'm the only one anymore.  It is a little dark inside but it's just too hard to stay away from this one. Service is good 90% of the time. We recommend the chorizo Brussel sprouts. We haven't been able to master them at home the way they do them. Yum!"}
{"text":"Large portions, a little pricey but  just split your meals."}
{"text":"Amazing place for fine dining.  My fiancé and I love the menu.  The steaks are top notch and fairly priced.  The drink menu is awesome along with the desert menu."}
{"text":"I ordered the Balsamic Chicken my wife also ordered a chicken dish that was over cooked and the pasta was dry! I  had to ask our awesome server for a stake knife to cut the chicken. The prices are too high for the quality of food and drinks. The tables are way too small for four people. Me and the other couple were partially in the aisle just to give each other room. My wife and i will be going back!"}
{"text":"Cool restaurant ! At  $20 per entree price point we found it quite a bargain based on the quality/taste  The owner even dropped by our table.   Best appetizers ever, try many! Reservations very strongly recommended.    I would return and I would recommend it to my friends and or my family."}
{"text":"I constantly have fantastic experiences at Trivs.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable when it comes to the menu and how dishes are prepared.  They are also very accommodating when it comes to changing entree sides.

The food is usually cooked perfectly, thought a few times it has been only good instead of great.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a well-cooked, delicious meal."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised during our first visit to Trivs's.  We've lived in Strongsville for almost three years and eat out frequently,  but usually venture to surrounding communites for good meals.  We went on a Saturday night during a snow storm and the place was packed but we didn't have to wait for a table.  The service was professional, prompt and knowledgeable.   Our food (almond crusted scallops and a filet special) was delicious and HOT.  I would absolutely go back and would bring my food snob parents with me too."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Had the Almond Crusted Scallops,  wife had the Eggplant parm, daughter 1 had meatball dinner and daughter 2 had cheeseburger. All loved it.  Don't forget to mention the Triv show to get free calamari. If your passing through the Triv Show is a local radio talk show host. The father of the owner.  BTW the calamari was excellent also."}
{"text":"Coffee crusted strip steak is out this world. Scampis are huge.  My wife and I's favorite restaurant in town.  The service and Mike Triv jr complete the evening.  Bring in business guest he rolls out the respect and service. Love this place"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Trivs and it was great!  Our server, Sarah, was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu and the food was great.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I met a friend for drinks and dinner last Thursday. I LOVED the truffle homemade ravioli -delicious!  I even enjoyed the entertainment.  We could still chat over the table so her singing wasn't too loud. Service was quite slow but we weren't in a hurry so maybe the waitress's sensed that. I really like the ambiance at Trivs. I will go again."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing the food is always great no matter what you order. The service is amazing and if you want a great server Gabby ! Wine list is great!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and super high prices. Ordered a ribeye steak, food took over 30 mins to come out, there were only 2 other tables, when it finally came out, they have me a prime rib. Tried a piece and it was totally gross. Sent it back, it smelt very bloody..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and our server was so nice she was making us feel at home I'll defiantly bring my family back here."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in the country. Not just Cleveland, Not just Ohio, the country. To be honest, probably the universe. I mean it's the best restaurant in the world, and the space-food garbage at extraterrestrial eateries are NOTHING in comparison. Come here if you want perfection. Perfectly executed, constantly changing recipes on their seasonal menu, and the best, most helpful, nicest service you'll get anywhere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, and food.  I decided to try the sacchetti which I had never even heard of before and it was sooo good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant one of my favorites!  Before I discovered the place I thought it was a sports bar from the outside as it is located towards the back of a strip center and the strip center appearance screams sports bar.  After entering the restaurant I was shocked.  Trivs is an awesome restaurant with amazing food and one of the friendliest staffs I have encountered.  Of all the times we have been there, the staff has always seemed to go above and beyond what is expected whether it was lunch or dinner.  I have never been disappointed with anything I have ever ordered."}
{"text":"Triv's is a great go-to for a fine meal with excellent service and drinks in Strongsville. The wait staff is the most courteous in Northeast Ohio and the food and desserts are outstanding. 

Had the blackened sea bass which they had as a special last time I was in. Perfectly prepared, with rice, corn and some kind of pesto garnish. Hot and delicious!

Others had the ribeye steak and the Waleye. Everyone was very pleased. For dessert, we tried cheesecake, creme brulee,  chocolate cake and canollis. All the desserts look like they came right out of a picture book. Very good!  

The owner is typically around chatting with his customers and ensuring everyone is getting what they expect. Nice little bar if you're not hungry."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner the other night - didn't know what to expect. Scallops were amazing, steak delicious and the atmosphere was fancier then I would have imagined."}
{"text":"Came here on a recent weekday for a lunch with my family.  was in the mood for steak and some french onion soup, plus we had a gift certificate to use up. ;-)

The service was prompt and attentive, and we settled in over the soup and salad first course. 
 The three cheese French onion soup had a nice hearty flavor, but not overly salty...tons of cheese which is never a bad thing!  Just as i finished up my crock of soup, the main entrees arrived.

The tenderloin medallions I ordered were cooked a perfect medium-rare and were covered in a thick au jus gravy along with tasty whipped potatoes and steamed asparagus.  This meal really hit the spot, glad to have come back here after so many years since my last visit."}
{"text":"Recently got their fish fry for $27.  Fish was hard and overcooked, and thought for that price things would have been housemade....but no. Frozen hushpuppies, waffle fries, coleslaw & tartar sauce. Not good."}
{"text":"Food was fine but had to sit on the patio because we did not have reservations.

Server talked way to fast!

Had been there several years ago.   OK but won't go back for a while."}
{"text":"We started with the calamari. My husband had an excellent rib eye and I had the lobster mac. Food was excellent and the live music was a nice touch. Great time- we will be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience thanks to Gabrielle. We had our kids with us (2 and 4) and as soon as we sat down she asked if we wanted to order something first for the kids. 

We had the ahi tuna special, shrimp scampi, swordfish and salmon and all 4 dishes were awesome. 

I went back a couple weeks later with my daughter and had a great experience again. The $9.99 kids steak dinner is an awesome deal for kids!"}
{"text":"This place is good. We have been here a few times now and have enjoyed each visit. Always seems to be crowded, but have not had to wait too long for a table. Our last visit, shortly before Christmas we stopped in for a couple drinks and appetizers. The servers seem to know a decent amount about their wines and helped us pick a good white for my wife and red for me. I like the bocce ball, calamari and crab cakes for appetizers. I like the Mahi Mahi and the Tuscan Grilled Carbonara as well. The service is always excellent although I sometimes feel a bit rushed as the staff will grab your plates as soon as you look finished. Not in a rude way, but you just don't feel relaxed much. We will keep coming back though as it is one of the best in Strongsville."}
{"text":"I came here for a baptism dinner with my boyfriends family. I had never been here before so I did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was very nice inside and the food was delicious! It was much more fancy and elegant than I had expected! My only complaint is that it was fairly dark in there so it was kind of difficult to see but overall I fully enjoyed myself and will be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"We  came last night as kind of a belated V-day dinner. We were greeted and seated promptly. Wife ordered some kind or mixed drink - she said it was good. I stuck with beer, as usual.

We started off with duck spring rolls, which were good, very crispy. My wife had the swordfsh, and while good, she said the salsa was unnecessary and the fish was slightly under seasoned. I had a medium rare ribeye that was fantastic; best I have had in a while, including the meat grilled at home.

Overall a good restaurant, and we will probably return. Only tiny complaint would be the service was kind of sterile, but it was efficient, so no big deal."}
{"text":"First timer recently at Trivs. The entertainment was on point with a guitar player. The wait staff was pleasant to look at just not pleasant to interact with. 
When you're going to charge me $28-$30 the expectation for quality is there. I paid Pomeroy prices and received TGIF's quality food.  I question what it considered fresh and would love to see what they keep frozen that's passed off as fresh.
I don't think I would be so disappointed if they were not trying to present themselves as a higher end establishment. 
Lastly, a couple things I noticed that didn't make sense. Try dusting the vent in the bathroom. No reason you should have dust caked up in that vent, doesn't anybody clean the bathroom notice that? Also, who advertises on a soap dispenser the contact info for the company that supplied the soap dispenser? Bars in Lakewood, that's who. Tacky for a place like this......
Lengthy and brutal but I had a high expectation when I walked in the door and was disappointed from first contact by the staff and lack of communication skills and friendliness...."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  My wife and splurge on Trivs once per year, and always look forward to our next visit. Our server AJ was exceptional, and the food was amazing. Nice atmosphere with a duo playing acoustic made for a romantic touch as we got started.  Crab cake and calamari as apps, and both did not disappoint. The crab cake was perfect, served atop a bed of spinach with a creamy sauce.  Almost burned my mouth on first couple bites it was served so hot.  Small salad w balsamic was just enough, topped with candied pecans. Main course filet with asparagus and garlic mashed red skinned potatoes. No knife needed to cut the steak, possibly the best I have ever had. Dessert included amaretto cheesecake and brownie w chocolate covered pretzel ice cream - wow!  Excellent service, food to match, but be prepared to drop a Ben Franklin.  Best food coma ever, now time for bed!!!"}
{"text":"My brother and I tried Triv's as a \"change of pace\" in our biweekly lunch together. What a pleasant surprise!  Our waitress Andrea, was tremendous. She was friendly and humorous.  We each had one of the wraps for lunch. They were  very tasty and filling. Overall the experience, food and service should make Triv's a staple for our meetings.  I had a Steak wrap with the tossed salad.  The salad included Triv's homemade Blue Cheese dressing.  It was fantastic.  My brother had a turkey wrap that was large enough to satisfy the biggest appetite.  Andrea was attentive and funny.  Her personality and the food will keep us coming back.
I returned with my wife one evening and had dinner.  The price is less modest at dinner but the steak made up for any cost.  This was simply the best Strip Steak that I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Have been to this location twice.  Not my choice.  First time was a large group.  They do have a party room but the staff did not seem prepared for the large group.  They did not have enough staff.   They where expected the group so they should have been prepared.  It is little pricey and not that special.  

Second time was a smaller gathering for mid day meal.  Food was not much better and still pricey.  Menu choices for those will dietary needs was limited and nothing in menu except for a salad.  They could have lighter items in the menu.  Hamburger was pricey and not that good."}
{"text":"Great place with a great atmosphere. Enjoyed the evening.Was out with friends. Luved the seating at the bar. The happy hour appetizers were amazing. The wine and food selections were excellent. Live music on select days adds to the mood and ambience. Everyone is very friendly and makes sure you are having a good time. Special thanks to Taylor who made it so special for all of us. She has the right personality and truly compliments this place. Taylor thanks again for taking great care of me and my guests. Would most definitely come back. Highly recommend this place. 
Thx
DR MD"}
{"text":"Unimpressed.

I had been wanting to try this place because I am a fan of Mike Trivisonno's radio show on WTAM 1100. I learned from our server that the place is owned by Mike's son, who is also named Mike. 

I had the French onion soup and a crab cake sandwich. The soup was good. The atmosphere of a restaurant influences how the food tastes. I'll elaborate: the soup was good, but not as good as French onion I've had at another place recently--the other place had a warmer, cozy environment. Triv's by contrast, had a cold, dull, almost generic feeling. The bowl the soup was in was not visibly affected by the cheese in the soup to the extent that the cheese stuck to it (which would indicate that the soup was not, say, microwaved to cook the cheese over the top of the bowl). I mention this because in a better bowl of French onion soup, the cheese should be and would be charred to the bowl, indicating that it was baked in an oven, as opposed to microwaved. I realize I'm being nit-picky. But it's important. 

On to the crab cake sandwich: it was a grade below so-so. 

A note about my friend's meal: she ordered the \"special of the day.\" Unfortunately she reported to me and our server that she could not detect too much that was special about the meal. It was fish--I think walleye, with pasta. The fish was reportedly very plain and the pasta was average--with some parmesan and maybe butter or olive oil. In other words, her meal was almost the *opposite* of special."}
{"text":"I really like trivs....their french onion soup is amazing... But today I stopped by myself for a little snack before running evening errands.  I felt very uncomfortable. The hostess ignored me when I came in the door and then proceeded to chat on the phone while I stood there. The blonde waitress also ignored me when I finally gave up and sat at the bar.  She was too busy chatting it up with some men and then was  snappy and rushed me through my meal. I left very disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for the first time for a quick Saturday meal at 5 pm before a movie.  We sat and the bar and we were greeted very warmly by our server. The restaurant is very nice inside and extremely clean. 
We both ordered the 'bocce' ball meatball with linguini.  The homemade large meatball was one of the best I've tasted.  It has the original homemade flavor like it's been simmering all day.  I think this is very difficult to find in the Cleveland area. It was delicious! 
The other menu items looked good but I'm afraid I will only order this dish on our return visit.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Started with calamari that was fresh and cooked perfectly.  Tasty sauce that had a nice acidic touch to it.  Wonderful seafood risotto. Lobster and shrimp cooked nicely and the scallops cooked perfectly (it's amazing how many restaurants cannot cook scallops this well).  Nice lobster cream sauce pairs nicely with the spinach risotto.   My son's ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The server recommended a nice wine by the glass.  Nice scotch list with  good price for a nice pour.  

The service was friendly, and effective = excellent.  Quickly removed used plates and silverware and immediately replaced the silverware for what was needed for the next course.  Refilled water immediately without being asked.

Very nice atmosphere.  Classy look.  Lower volume music playing in the background.   A Few TV's at the bar.  Live acoustic and small group music Wed - Sat.

Definite return !!"}
{"text":"Had a choice to where to go for my birthday. So glad I picked Trivs. Felt welcome from the time we walked in. I was having a hard time deciding between the filet or scallops. Then our server read us the specials. Twin filet medallions with a Rosemary Demi-glacé and an 8oz lobster tail. Fabulous. I hardly ever finish a meal and take leftovers but not this time. Finished it all. Here comes the inevitable question of dessert, which I never have but our server explained that dessert is on the house for a birthday so may as well try it. I'm glad I did. The brownie sundae was unbelievable and I actually almost finished it despite it being so huge. Imagine a molten brownie an inch and a half high topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Great service, great food. Thanks to the staff of Trivs for helping me have an awesome birthday."}
{"text":"Daily fresh seafood selection is always on point ,cooked perfectly and fresh. Excellent value and flavor on the steaks also .  

Entertainment Wed. through Saturday is always tasteful and enjoyable. 

The owner is often there overseeing the already friendly , knowledgeable staff. Whether it's lunch or dinner if you want a clean establishment with daily specials and excellent food Triv's is a place to try ."}
{"text":"Our friends rave about this place so we met them on a recent Saturday evening for dinner and drinks.

We sat at a six-person high top in the bar... the atmosphere is amazing!  The bar area is dimly lit and slightly trendy.  We didn't check out the restaurant.  We DID check out the clientele though... wow!  Woman after woman after woman was barely dressed and left nothing to the imagination - including the hostess.  Beautiful people add something exotic to an atmosphere and we enjoyed the floor show.

Our table shared several appetizers including Spicy Calamari, a Cheese and Olive plate and Grilled Brussels Sprouts.  Everything was good but I won't wake up in the middle of the night craving something that only \"Triv's\" can supply me with.

The wine and beer selection was okay - we found a nice dry Petit Syrah that was acceptable to all of our party.  We drank 2 bottles, it was red, it was dry, my husband drank it... it wasn't memorable.

I should mention here that I saw no hamburgers on the menu (I had no intentions of ordering a hamburger).  Although the menu prices were pretty elevated we were sitting in a BAR; a bar at a high-top table; with our feet dangling beneath us.  If I shut my eyes while sitting there I could have been any number of places -Outback Steakhouse, TGIFriday's.  I'm not sure what all of the fuss is about.

I ordered a ribeye steak (RARE!) and my husband ordered some kind of seafood (perch?)  I had mashed potatoes... ho hum.  My steak, when I received it was LITERALLY an inch thick and dry and pinkish brown inside.  I did not complain because I am certain that a steak that thin CANNOT be prepared rare unless they serve it raw (which actually would have been better.)  How can an establishment that touts such great steaks on the menu serve such a thin, tasteless ribeye?  I have come to the conclusion that you pay for atmosphere and the eye-candy here.

We were offered the dessert menu but declined because our friend had made a gluten-free mocha cream pie for our other friend's birthday... yikes!  This amazing pie was THE BEST PART of our meal - and it wasn't prepared by the restaurant!  It had a dense, black, buttery chocolate-cookie crumble crust that fell apart on the fork but stuck to my teeth.  The deep chocolate-espresso ganache helped to hold the crust together just long enough to lift it from the plate and place on your tongue.  An explosion of rich, thick, chewy, crumbled goodness was elevated by the milk chocolate fluff that sat on the top of this concoction.  Our friend served it to us in a foil pie plate.  

A fitting theme for our evening:  looks can be deceiving."}
{"text":"Very good service and very good food. My steak was cooked perfectly and the crabcakes were amazing!"}
{"text":"The seafood here is usually very good, albeit a bit pricey. Skip the body mary, as it tastes very strange, not a bit tomatoey - this is disconcerting, considering the drink prices. The wait staff is very attentive, which again is reflected in the prices."}
{"text":"I confess that I am a  food snob, and Triv's is one restaurant where I know that I will get an excellent meal.  Have been there many times and love everything that I have ordered.  The seasonal menu has so many wonderful selections, appetizers, soups salads and main entrees. The specials are off the chart.  The fish is so fresh and expertly prepared.  The veal and pork chops are a taste sensation!!  The friendly, attentive and professional staff help to make this even a more enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Couldn't have asked for a better dinner! We went back here for Valentines Day dinner and it was excellent. We had reservations and the table was ready and the service prompt. We started with the fried calamari and roasted red peppers. Very good, not my favorite but still good. I then enjoyed their Lobster bisque and dunked their great bread into the soup. It was perfect. Not to thick and full of flavor. I ordered the Tuscan grilled shrimp carbonera and my date ordered the port seared scallops and risotto. I was very impressed with both. Her dish was actually much better than mine. The port sauce was great and the spinach risotto was almost perfect. My shrimp and garlic cream pasta was very good but I have really come to enjoy risotto and the scallops with the other dish were cooked just right. The service was very good especially on a busy night like that. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, EXCELLANT food, Very professional and courteous staff, and impeccably clean atmosphere! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Triv's was recommended to me by my client here in Strongsville. I'm really happy that I was able to go and enjoy this little gem of a restaurant. I went with the 12 oz. Ribeye that came with potato gratin and caramelized Brussels sprouts. Truly a wonderfully, tasty meal."}
{"text":"This place is TRYING to be upscale but it's no use. The decor and ambiance is dreadful. We started with the calamari appetizer and of course you could tell it wasn't fresh, was tasteless and rubbery. The entree? The veal parm was tough, you could tell it was old. How does that happen?  Idk!  My husband ordered a steak medium. Came out well done. They didn't offer to fix it. Tasteless cocktails, ho hum servers. Definitely won't be back. Just another guy thinking he can run a successful restaurant with no clue how to do it."}
{"text":"We were hoping to go somewhere else but couldn't get a reservation so we decided to try Triv's and were very happy we did!  The atmosphere was nice and the food was and service was excellent.  I had the french onion soup which was delicious and definitely not microwaved as another poster commented.  My husband had the Cesar salad and we both had the 12 oz Ribeye.  The steak was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here last night for a date night, and it was a very big disappointment. We had the stuffed banana peppers and clam chowder as appetizers. The peppers were greasy and soggy. The clam chowder was excellent, however. Entrees were the salmon and the scampi. The salmon was just ok, it was very watery though. The scampi was small and very salty and oversauced. My green beans were very oily and my sweet corn risotto was undercooked and chewy. My husband's rice tasted like plastic, as though it had been pre-portioned and stored in plastic. It was a very busy Friday night, so we paid our check without mentioning the food. We probably won't be back, which is sad considering we had heard such great things."}
{"text":"What a surprise!!  Old school taste in a warm, inviting setting.  Eggplant and meatball over linguini was excellent."}
{"text":"Went with friends. 2/28. Excellent bruschetta. His wife had chilean sea bass. He had strip. They loved their dinners. Wife and I split bone in rib-eye. Fantastic. Jallopeno rissotto excellent. Wife and I went a couple weeks ago. Had rib -eye and clamari. We'll be coming often if it stays this quality."}
{"text":"I can't be the first person to have an awful experience here... 
It was really busy when we came in so we went and had a drink at the bar and enjoyed the live music. The bartender was great!
Once seated, out server was good. However, my food was not edible. It was truly awful. My mashed potatoes tasted like charcoal.. Uhh how does that even happen? Luckily, our server was nice and the manager did comp my meal. 
I may go back and try again because I always hear people rave about this place.. But for the price you pay, you shouldn't have ashy potatoes. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is a personal hidden gem for me. Fantastic friendly service with a very accommodating staff. 

I ordered the French onion soup and CAB ribeye steak. The soup was piping out with the beautiful burnt edges around the bowl. 

The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Probably one of the best steaks that I have eaten in a very long time. 

Great live music tonight which is a big plus! 

Wow! This place is really great. I look forward to returning again. 

Carry on Trivs! Please visit here soon and often!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm passing through, this is the first place I hit before I check into my hotel. The finesse that they put on the appetizers that I've had were top notch. Port wine reduction on the skirt steak for a happy hour dish was more than I needed and I was in a pure indulgent state with the chirizo sausage roasted brussell sprouts. Friendly group at the bar and high level talent on stage for a wednesday evening. Enjoy next time you stop in !!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and menu - highly recommend as the area is saturated with chain restaurants and this unique menu is definitely one to be checked out!"}
{"text":"Looking for good quiet live music (is that an oxymoron?), a good drink, and tasty food - Trivs is the place!  They have live music Wednesday - Saturday.  The talent varies, but I love how you can still carry on a conversation with the person next to you and listen to the music.  This is a great place to meet for a drink.  I have loved every meal I have eaten here and recommend trying the hamburger.  They cook it to perfection and the fries are amazing.  

In summary - awesome bartenders (Heather is the best), love the music, and good food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars at Triv's for holidays and special occasions!  Every meal we've ever had has been phenomenal.  Great steaks, delicious pastas, fun atmosphere in the bar area, and wonderful drink menu make Trivs an obvious choice for us when we're looking for some place to celebrate!   Terrific staff, as well!"}
{"text":"We went without reservations on Mother's Day.  They still managed to find us a table for my wife and 2 kids.  We greatly appreciated that, as we were in the mood for some nicer fare.

The service was impeccable.  Exactly what I would expect from a higher end restaurant.  Bussers to take empty plates almost as soon as you have laid down your silverware.  Servers helping each other out and friendly to each other.  The owner came around often to check on everyone's dishes.

The food was fantastic.  The pasta is fresh, not dried, so it has an amazing texture to it.  Wife got Chicken Parm, and while it's not hard to screw up that dish, it was fantastic.  Fresh tasting sauce without too much punch.  I got the ribeye \"Simply Seasoned\".  It had a fantastic flavor, was tender, and cooked perfectly.  The potatoes with spinach and bacon were amazing, also.

For Mother's Day, they also gave my wife a $25 gift certificate, so I guess we will definitely be going back.

Excellent job TRIV!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here at Trivs the environment was nice and welcoming. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. That said there was definitely some highs and lows. 

I had wanted to do a rather special order, I didn't want a full portion of the lobster Mac and cheese but rather substitute it for a side with my steak. The staff was happy to work with me on this request eventually agreeing they could give me a 1/2 portion at 1/2 price which was acceptable to me. Actually this turned out to be a bargain. It may have been the best Mac and cheese I've had anywhere. It was made with goat cheese and fontina and was spectacular. It was perfectly rich and creamy work the sweetness of the goat cheese really shining through. 

The bad was my steak was rather overcooked. The good news was the waitress apologized and immediately fetched the manager who was willing to replace the steak. I declined so she insisted on paying for our drinks. The hallmark for me of a restaurant is how special orders and complaints are handled. I didn't plan for or expect either but feel Trivs did a great job with both. 

Also the canolli were delicious."}

{"text":"Overrated and wayyyyy overpriced. Staff makes you feel like they're doing you a favor by seating you. Reservations mean nothing to them. If people from their inner circle come in, they're seated first. Food nothing special. Pretty limited menu."}
{"text":"Trivs is an awesome restaurant! The venue is modern and always clean, and the staff are wonderful. They have an outdoor patio during the warmer months, and a private event space to hold events up to 50. I've been several times for lunch, but enjoyed everything I've gotten. The veggie wrap, BLT, and French dip were all yummy. Also, the sweet potato fries are delicious! Perfect combination of soft and crispy. The specialties are the steaks, which I've only heard positive things about. The owner and chef are great people, and I love supporting local businesses. Weekends are busy, so it's best to make a reservation. Locals know how great Trivs is, and are all repeat clients!"}
{"text":"Steak is amazing! The atmosphere is really great, older crowd. I recommend making a reservation in advance, however they did accommodate us and were able to give us a table for 2 hours."}
{"text":"They are overpriced in my book. Very friendly. I wish the owner would wear something other than Jeans if he wants me to pay upper scale prices."}
{"text":"We walked in expecting this to be a hole in a wall bar based on the name. Boy were we surprised when we walked in. The decor was fancy and we felt a little under dressed in our jeans, but no one batted an eye that we were dressed down. The entrees were around 20-30$ a piece and we decided why not and stay for a good Italian meal. We both had pasta and it was delicious and there was plenty left over for the next day. Our waitress was very sweet as well. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant for a casual lunch.  The atmosphere was relaxing(no loud music).  It was dark in the restaurant, however.  Maybe
 a better ambiance for dinner?  We sat for a few minutes before a waitress approached the table. She seemed almost annoyed that she had to wait on us.  The group I was with ordered wraps and salads, not too difficult. Unfortunately, it was 40 minutes before our food arrived.  Luckily, we are all retired and weren't on a lunch break.  My chicken salad wrap was tasty.  The sweet potato fries included with it were also tasty, however, many were undercooked and limp, while others were overcooked. Others in my group said their food was tasty but nothing sensational.  It was a good value, my bill was under eleven dollars.  Not sure I will go to Trivs any time soon.  I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"What a little gem this is! First off, this is NOT a burger place as listed. This is actually a really nice place. Hyde Park it is not, but definitely a tablecloth kind of place. We came later in the evening and had  a drink on their patio. What a perfect place for a date! So pretty and romantic. We had a few appetizers which were good too.

I must say the bar area was off the chain. There was a guy playing the guitar and a singer and people were LOVIN it. 

So this place really gives you any type of vibe you're looking for whether it be a romantic date or a night of singin' American Pie out loud."}
{"text":"Stopped here while in town for business.  My co-worker and I wanted to be seated, but I glanced over at the bartender and she winked at me.  That's when I realized I was really going to like this place.  After calling an audible and sitting at the bar, we were greeted with a big smile from the bartender.  I think her name was Abby.  I asked her what I should order and she said to get the ribeye.  I told her French fries instead of the cheese potato thing and she leaned in and smacked me across the face and said \"no... you're getting it.\"  Boy was I happy with that choice.  It looked like a potato in the shape of lasagna sculpted from the hands of Jesus...with the perfect amount of cheese inside.   After devouring the food, my associate and I asked the bartender to do a shot with us and she politely declined saying that she does not drink on the job.  That's ok, I drank for the both of us.  If I ever decide to move to Ohio and open a restaurant, I know exactly who I'm going to recruit.  Anyways, go here, buy some steak, give Abby a high five, tip well, and wear some nice clothes.  This is a really great place where you don't kick off your flip flops or ask the bartender for a cheap drink.  The well is higher end liquor and the live music was relaxing and enjoyable after a long day's work.  I will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Five - yes, FIVE stars for Trivs.  Our travelling group of 12 came in two nights ago for dinner.  Only kind of knew \"steak house\" from the description.  What we were treated to was outstanding service in a semi-private room, food that each and every one of us said was so good that there were 12 clean plates at the end of the meal.  And my friends, that just doesn't happen often with this ragged bunch of dining misfits.

For my part, I chose to roll the dice with one of the specials.  The way I heard it was \"king click\" - a nice white fish.  Post-meal googling tells me that this is actually \"kingklip\" - a fish with the body of an eel and the face of a fish.  And let me tell you - this was one of the more outstanding fish meals I've had in the last couple of years.  Brilliantly prepared in a light breading with a sauce which, although I couldn't identify, I would have had more and more, were it offered.

But it wasn't just me.  Each of my dining companions, whether they were eating a steak or some fish variation, complimented their meal.  Quite unusual.

And the few of us who had desert were also quite happy!

Should we ever return to Strongsville, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tiny place, not a big draft selection. I am a beer snob lately, they have no craft beers. Not my cup of tea, or beer :)

It was late when I went and Wed night, so it may be better, ill give it another shot. This place sits tight across the street from South Park Mall, I never would have known. 

People were really cool there, staff and customers alike. Atmosphere is cool, ill check it out again."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and the place was wonderful for our business meeting. We started off with the stuffed peppers, and I highly recommend them! My only regret was not ordering more stuffed peppers!

I went simple and just had the Blackened Chicken Wrap, and it was fantastic. My colleague was a bit dismayed with the portion size of his meal, but other than that, everyone loved their experience here. Will plan to be back!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently very good and the service is outstanding.i have been there many times and never been disappointed. I can't say enough about the staff!"}
