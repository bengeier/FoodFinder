{"text":"I recently tried out the Blue Willo Cafe for lunch.  I was not impressed.  I tried the Willo Cobb salad and it just didnt seem to be very fresh.  Neither did my coworkers Veggie Sandwich. I would probably not return, considering that there are many other options in the neighborhood  with much better food."}
{"text":"We are fortunate enough to have Blue Willo cater to the Native American Connections lobby at lunch time. I've only ordered the fruit and cheese plate, but several of my co-workers rave endlessly about the pulled pork sandwiches. The man that comes to sell the food is the happiest, most delightful man you'll run into - at least in our building. I wouldn't think of Blue Willo Cafe as a place to get good barbecue - they should really change the name to Blue Willo Barbecue Cafe or something... but I recommend it. If you're in the Native American Connections Building at lunch time, plan to stop for lunch. I'm going to have to check out their brick and mortar version - surprised I've never done so, considering it's a short jaunt from the building."}
{"text":"Last night, we were planning on going to the TUCK Shop to have dinner but the restaurant was too packed to seat 8 people.  Then we tried going to the Coronado Cafe and SWITCH it was the same scenario.  Driving up on Central I spied the Blue Willo Cafe and decided to try the place.  And I am so glad I did!!
They are doing bbq specials on FRIDAY nights only- open until 10pm and it was the BEST, BEST bbq pork rib I've EVER, EVER had!!  The pork ribs were meaty, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and full of flavor.  Not just the bbq sauce that generously coated the ribs- the meat too!!  It was DELICIOUS!!  If there was no one else in the restaurant I would have been licking my fingers clean it was that good.
The platter was served with 2 sides- we got beans and rice.  The beans were also the best I've ever had.  Full of brown sugar flavor- you can see chunks of bacon and onion.  GASTRONOMIC DELIGHT!!
The owner are from Memphis- super friendly- she was so delighted that I was enjoying her ribs so much that she brought out corn bread muffins for me to try and I could tell they were made from scratch- not \"homemade from a box\" kind!
For those moments while I was eating those ribs, I feel like I was transported from Phoenix to down South where the folks were easy going and friendly and the bbq absolutely mouth watering.
If you are a bbq lover, you MUST try this place.  ONLY on FRIDAY nights open until 10pm!!"}
