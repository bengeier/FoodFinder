{"text":"This was my first time trying Tango Food Truck. We ordered several items...the steak bowl, choripan sandwich, spinach empanada, and fries. The steak in the steak bowl was seasoned so well. The best meat I have had outside of Gaucho in Pittsburgh. It came with spinach and grilled vegetables which were also delicious. I had a bite of my husbands choripan sandwich. It had a very different but good taste to it.  The food took longer than I expected to be ready being a food truck, but once I took my first bite of that steak I realized it was well worth the wait.  There is no doubt I will be returning to this truck."}
{"text":"The fries were good.  After speaking with the chefs here.  I have decided to update my first review.   A big fan.   However there were about 10 of us at the truck but it took 20 minutes for fries.  Everyone was waiting and getting really irritated.   If you get the wait time under 10 minutes.  I would def give it a 5 star"}
{"text":"Tried the Steak Bowl.  A healthy food truck option.  What?What?"}
{"text":"Tried the Tango Sandwich.  It had some nice flavor but was a bit pricey for what it was.   Also, the bun fell apart before I finished eating the sandwich.   The sweet potato fries were very good.   You get a nice portion size for just $4.    I would eat here again, though I would probably try something different from the menu next time."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and well seasoned. I ordered the steak bowl and loved every bite! Steak was tender and had an amazing sauce on top. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Just got the empanadas but they were great! Would defiantly return to have a full meal."}
{"text":"Today I realized I never write about food trucks! What kind of jerk am I that I constantly praise the amazing restaurants in Pittsburgh but fail to acknowledge the deliciously talented trucks we have! Tango is amazing and unique in Pittsburgh. Their empanadas are flavorful and the sauce that comes with them is also exceptional. They have an amazing steak sandwich that if also delicious and fresh! I have also seen theses fries that have chicken and cheese on them... I only let myself drool at them for a second or two before I head to the bathroom to stare in the mirror and talk myself out of it.  Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Best food truck in Pittsburgh, all the food is authentic and tastes great. The empanadas and sausage are my personal favorite but the other foods are good too"}
{"text":"I caught the Tango Food Truck parked up on Route 60 in Robinson Township today, and ordered a few empanadas.  I tried the Spinach, Corn, and Beef (one of each).  They came with a little portion cup of dipping sauce, and they were all very delicious."}
{"text":"Tango has Authentic Argentinian food.  The menu includes Steak Sandwich, Milanesa, empanadas Beef Kabob, Chorizo & salad.   Had the Choripan sausage sandwich with chimichurri, onions and peppers.  It came with a side of rice.  Great sandwich.   Check them out on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tangofoodtruck/"}
