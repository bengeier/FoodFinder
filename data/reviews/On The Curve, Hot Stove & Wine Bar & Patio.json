{"text":"Great place to hang out. Food quality is great and good overall value. Weekends are very busy and this is one of the popular weekend places."}
{"text":"On the curves is now closed. They closed down about two weeks ago and they still have the lights on outside and don't have a sign out saying closed. Oh well next place."}
{"text":"A very limited menu option which has not been updated on there wedsite. The food it self  tastes was if it were reheated, and absolutely no tast,  it was hard to eat half of my meal. Services was horrible, I waited an hour and a half for my drinks. All of meals came out a different times. When wanting to speak with a supervisor they told me she was in a meeting and continued to be in the meeting for the remainder of the evening there. On the website it states live Dj at 9:30pm. The Dj didn't come in until 11pm.  And didnt get started until 11:30 And by that time I had enough!  Wouldn't recommend this place at all. Sorry"}
{"text":"conveniently located around Square 1 Shopping.  Nicely decorated Restaurant area, but we liked the soafs in the lounge.  There's a dance floor, free salsa dance lessons Wednesday, i think?   Appies are 1/2 off M-F - they are yummy.  Had flatbread, bruschetta, mussles, cheese dip.   Service was professional & prompt.    Good wine list, BOYB on Monday = no corkage fee!!!  {Tues-Fri $20corkage} - what a deal?!  Overall, the decor, atmophere, other patrons (after work business atire), food, and drinks were above par.  If I lived here i would dfinately try the free dance lessons :-)"}
{"text":"Caribbean Shrimp Salad?  Why not.  This lonely business traveler needs a decent healthy meal that is not a big production.  Wait, what's that I just bit into?  Gosh.  For real?  It is, OMG, Lichee!  It is a good combination of spicy shrimps, mango flavor dressing, fresh greens and veggies, and, of course, choice fruits.  The portion is enough for a meal, particularly accompanied with the famed garlic and potato soup that is thick, creamy, and teased with some morsels of intense flavors.  This is not a cheap restaurant..."}
{"text":"Good thing it closed down as did not have much curve left in it!  This joint was ok and run poorly. just another place to chill with friends as the food comes very very late and nothing much. Service is a little slow when the food comes to mind and the food is ok as well.  The benefit it used to provide was restaurant, bar and a dance floor all in under one roof."}
{"text":"I came here for a Friday lunch last week.   It's a pretty trendy looking place, with booths or tables up against bench seats for half the place, and more of a bar lounge type feel to the other half (not in use during the lunch we were there).  In addition to their regular menu they handed us a daily special list. Between the two of us we ordered two soups, and two entrees (one each off the daily special menu and the regular menu).  In both cases the regular menu produced better tasting, more flavourful food so I would recommend sticking with that if you go.  The food is a little off beat, for example the soup \"Roasted Garlic & Baked Potato Soup\" came complete with a marshmellow in the middle. I've never seen a restaurant do this before either but they bring your bowl with the garnishes to your table and in a separate \"jug\" your hot soup which they pour into your bowl right in front of you. It's a cute gimic.   The waitress was a bit odd, insisting I do the ordering for myself, and acting a bit abruptly at times but she may have just been having a bad day.  Overall it wasn't bad, I just wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.  **EDIT**   Came back here a second time for lunch. My boyfriend went with the spicy pasta again, and again it was better than the other meal. Also, our waitress was much nicer this time. On The Curve is a pretty decent lunch option."}
{"text":"Can I give this a 0 star?!  The food. Awful. I can't even describe the horror. The wine - It is a wine bar but they don't actually carry wine... seriously? The dance floor - DJ was good, dancing... maybe it was the night but no one was dancing and a lot of older men just staring (not my scene).  Thank you but no thank you. Ever."}
{"text":"This place is the biggest failblog!  My co-workers and I wanted to do a Latin Night. We were told that this place was really good. We looked up the directions, checked to see if the Latin Night was still happening on Wednesday and it seemed like everything was on point. We printed out the information at our work for all of those willing to come.  Wednesday comes - We all get there. We see an 8.5 x 11 piece of wrinkled paper saying: Restaurant is Closed! Then I decided to call the number provided at the front of the venue - number does not exist.   If they are closed then close down your website or at least say on your website it is closed. Don't have your blue lights. NOT IMPRESSED!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once for dinner with a group of eight for a date night on a Saturday when there was dancing but didn't get up :( . Wmy husband and I shared the bbq chicken flatbread $10.77 for appetizer which was crispy and yummy. Comes with 5 pieces which was good for us 2.  Then we shared the Fettuccini: sun-roasted tomatoes, smoked chicken & oyster mushrooms in a creamy white wine Alfredo sauce $17.91 for an entree and it was yummy and a pretty nice portion. we were full from that and a bottle of Ironstone Vineyards Cab -  $ 45 which was very very yummy even with the food we picked that wasn't paired with the bottle we ordered before we looked at the menu. the server was very nice even though we were missing a few people for about an hour. The music doesn't interfere with the dining because it is in a separate room but you can hear the band nicely. It added to the atmosphere and over all it was a good night with really great friends."}
{"text":"Every time I go to on the Curve I am never disappointed. The food is ALWAYS delicious no matter what I order. They pay so much attention to detail, presentation and the flavour combinations are AMAZING!  I always see birthdays being celebrated in large groups which seem like they can accommodate quite well; I usually only go with 2-4 people.   There is always live entertainment on Friday nights with a dance floor which makes it fun and something different to do (I believe there are some drink specials as well; $5 martinis if I am not mistaken).   The wait staff has always been friendly too.    One thing though is that once when we went for dinner after 9pm on a weekend they made us pay a cover charge but told us that we could redeem the cover charge when we left which I found kind of strange. This may have changed since then but if a guest is going to spend $100 on food, don't hassle them with a cover charge just to be reimbursed.   All in all though, a great experience and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is a restaurant and a lounge at night. Near square one. Good area for business.  Came here for a friend's birthday so they had reservations for about 15 people and one waitress attended all of us...so that took a bit of time but she did a good job and good service considering the fact that it was only her.   The food was okay, i got a Caesar salad, chicken sandwich w/fries. The portions are a bit small and the food is a bit pricey and a bit flavorless if i may say so.  Later that night the \"party\" started, the DJ played mostly top 40. The crowd was definitely older maybe 30+. Every night of the week is a different, Wendsday is latin night which i heard was the best day of the week to come because it gets packed. i have yet to go on a wendsday nights.   i had a good time but the older crowd and the flavorless food didn't really excite me."}
{"text":"Nice lil' venue. Food, drinks, patio, dance floor, and a live band which was surprisingly very entertaining. Had a wonderful evening (for the most part). This place in conveniently located near Sq.1 and open late late nite. Nice place for a party/get together/an evening out right in Mississauga. Only problem is service was not so impressive, they took their time, and yelled at my friend for grabbing her own lemon. If they take 15 minutes to pass a lemon wedge, we're gonna have a problem. All in all, I'd probably end up back there again!"}
