{"text":"Sam and Lisa are fantastic night after night.  I stay at the hotel 1 week a month.  Great service.  Wednesday nights Steve and Linda do Trivia, they work at WINT 1330 am, huge crowd and lots of fun.  Steve is right of Attila the Hun but I am helping him see the light.  Tip Well!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience. The restaurant is in the hotel and looks great after a remodel. However, the food was less than what you would expect. The chili was hot and cold. They either microwaved it or it was frozen and and had to subsequently be reheated. The salads were fair - however the chicken in them was bland and rubbery. They obviously put a lot of $ into the remodel - but they sacrificed the very reson you go to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with some friends and was not impressed the drink prices were good but the food was not as described and not worth what they charged got the burbon glazed salmon it was 18 bucks came with a salad which was the best thing of everything. The salmon looked like I went to aldi got frozen pieces of salmon cooked it and put spicy BBQ sauce on it . My gf got a chicken dish which said it was rolled with cheese and baked sounded like it would be a whole piece of chicken rolled up with cheese and pancheta with pasta . Instead it was more chopped up chicken mixed in Alfredo with bacon not even close. Someone needs to go back to cooking school sorry can't pawn things off for what they aren't"}
{"text":"It was later and my husband was actually looking for a desert.  It turns out they don't have any deserts on their menu.  I ordered wine, it was oxidize.  We both ordered salads.  My husband's salad was made with browned lettuce.  I ordered a Caesar salad the ingredients were fresh enough, but if McDonald's served a Caesar salad, this is what they would serve replete with prepackage tasteless croutons and topped with powdery cheese like substance.    I always wondered why a hotel would spend money on what looks like an expensive remodel and serve what is the equivalent to drive through food?"}
{"text":"Can't really rate the food because no one waited on me nor did they acknowledge my presence. I walked in. No one greater me although there was a bartender and one other staff member. I sat at a table for approximately 10 minutes. At that point, I left. I hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and the food was good.  Sam and Lisa were the only 2 working and they served about 45 people without missing a beat. Service was excellent!  Thanks girls :)"}
