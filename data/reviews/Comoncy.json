{"text":"This was probably the worst coffee experience I have ever had. The barista was extremely extremely rude and very slow. I waited ten minutes to put in my order and there were only two people in front of me. When I reached the counter, I tried to order a drink with caramel...they were out of caramel. My friend tried to order a chai latte...they were out of chai. Then I ordered granola and they were out of almond milk... i got non-fat milk instead which was about room temperature. This was 930 in the morning so they were clearly unprepared for the day. Meanwhile, two other guys were working at the coffee shop but just standing around! Go to the store and buy everything you are out of or help make a drink! I will never come back here. In addition, the cappuccino was definitely below average."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but service was horrible. The guy behind the counter was horribly pretentious, and seemed genuinely pissed that we interrupted his morning by ordering food. It also took 15 minutes and 2 reminders to get our drink orders...which btw, were drip coffees."}
{"text":"Overpriced to say the least. $5 for a bottle of water + $11 for a sandwich... Nice little $20 lunch.  No lines and plenty of empty tables but plan on waiting for 15 minutes to get your sandwich. #oldtown"}
{"text":"The immediate area known as the \"District\" was delightful, but the service was limited. When we asked if we could eat indoors in the attached restaurant/bar it felt as if it was ok, but not recommended. While we waited it was clearly felt we should have eaten outside. The feeling of not being welcomed was abundantly clear as our food was bagged to go. Poor customer service!"}
{"text":"I mean....it wasn't horrible. But it definitely does not have that cute coffee shop vibe. The food was good. Coffee sucked. I would come back for the food and that's it. Not the atmosphere of coffee"}
{"text":"Coffee is excellent. Had a regular and vanilla latte. Plus you get a 10% discount if you stay at the W!  Will definitely be back. Sorry Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I have come to Comoncy on multiple trips to Old Town because its perfect design of grabbing a quick bite and one of the juices! (Got to get the i-booster) Dominique, Jesse, Meti have taken care of me on multiple occasions and are nothing but exceptional. They have become my good-morning buddies to get my day started. My only knock is on Brian, I clearly frustrated him on my latest visit by just asking for ketchup; Dominique was making great conversation with another customer and I asked for this small condiment and received an eye roll and a finger to \"hold on\"... He may not of been out there expecting to help people out, but this was a clear turnoff . This set up is awesome! For everyone, this will become your new morning jump start. (just watch out for Brian and that finger!)"}
{"text":"I'm in love with the mocha, and if you ask the barista for a suggestion you'll never be disappointed. The food is great with amazing appearance, taste and I think worth every penny for organic, local products. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is garbage.  25min turnaround time for a sandwich and a salad, with only one other table even there.  Mediocre food, and one bottle water that ended up being $5.  Pass this place up."}
{"text":"I visit coffee shops very frequently and decided I would give this one a shot, as it is located near my office. 

The customer service was exemplary and the barista did a great job with taking my order. However, for the price, quantity and quality of the drink, I am completely dissatisfied. The size of the mocha latte is a standard tall from your local Starbucks. The espresso is very powerful - which may be a positive for some, but in my case it was so overbearing that I could not taste the flavor of the mocha nor the almond milk. It is possible that the espresso shots put in may have sat too long, thus expiring and ruining the entire flavor of the drink.

I will not recommend to friends or colleagues based on my experience."}
{"text":"I have not tried the food, but there espresso is the closest I have had to Italy. The taste, the texture, and the creaminess. The key to enjoying a great espresso is never taking it to go. Always have it in the espresso cup. And they have the cups available."}
{"text":"Weird little coffee counter next to a loud nightclub and only has outdoor seating. My drink was okay..."}
{"text":"I use to like this place but i was really not happy today. For lunch i placed my order on their app and when i went to pick it up, it was completely wrong!! There was no dressing on the salad and the sandwich i got wasnt the chicken panini. I was very disappointed and wont be visiting again. Today was a waste of $12!!"}
{"text":"Right across the street from the W Hotel and they offer a 10% discount to hotel guests. Excellent pour-over coffee and an outstanding breakfast burrito. Bagels and bagel sandwiches are also really good. The service was great both days we went. We ordered our drinks and food and then sat in the Dakota to enjoy them. The guys delivered everything to us each day. Very friendly and helpful. Definitely my go-to coffee place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Staff was so friendly and I will be coming back to try their pastries. Potatoes were delicious and the breakfast burrito was huge and very well balanced. Iced tea had a weird taste at first but taste good now. Great energy, and clean establishment."}
{"text":"Best iced vanilla latte ever created!  My favorite place for coffee and juices!"}
{"text":"I stopped by while my friends ate and drank at Dakota, the adjacent restaurant, and grabbed a Vanilla Latte with coconut milk. The staff was friendly and informed me their food is prepared in the same kitchen as Dakota and I could order at Comoncy and eat at Dakota seeing as they don't have tables. My latte was great and the food options were great considering my limited vegetarian diet. My latte was actually made with coconut milk unlike other coffee shops which will often try and pull the wool over my eyes. Great place to grab a quick coffee or bite!"}
{"text":"My wife Ellen and I had lunch today at Comoncy, thanks to our finding it on Groupon. We sat outside at a shady table and really enjoyed our initial visit there. We will be going back, for sure! 

Ellen had their homemade vegetable barley soup accompanied by two slices of perfectly  grilled baguette. I had the Beverly Hills Club in another superb bread, featuring some amazingly crispy bacon inside. 

Our next stop at Comoncy will be for breakfast. The menu choices look highly appealing. Counter staff were friendly and gracious. You can't miss by going to Comoncy!"}
{"text":"Upon a recommendation from one who knows I'm a huge coffee snob
I love the ambiance and there concept
Very easy to find and a great menu
Upon taking the first sip of this mocha
I find it to be very palate pleasing
Well made not to hot nor cold a happy medium
Great flavor the right amount of sweetness however not overly done. 
A truly excelent cup of coffee"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, french toast and breakfast burrito! If you are looking for an organic and amazing experience go here. Their burrito is truly amazing, not your typical breakfast burrito! Delicious with every bite! Yum!"}
{"text":"Solid coffee shop. Stayed at the W and hit this place up for coffee and breakfast. Cold brew was good and the egg-celent sandwich was even better. Good music and atmosphere too."}
{"text":"This location is attached Dakota. They share bathrooms. There is not really any indoor seating but plenty of outdoor. 

Came here around 8 on a Saturday morning and there were only a couple people here and it was very relaxing. 

Got a couple drinks a almond milk cap and a ibooster juice. The almond milk cap was delicious and the barista told us off the bat that they didn't foam as well. I already knew this but it's good for people that have never experienced almond milk in a cap or latte before.

The ibooster juice was fresh pressed and was exactly what I wanted. Just enough ginger taste but not too sweet. 

I recommend coming here for your juice and coffee needs."}
{"text":"Had the organic cold brew and I was shocked by how smooth/great tasting it was. I am an avid cold brew drinker(mostly from starbucks) and this put all the others to shame. Highly recommend this place for a morning coffee and pastry."}
{"text":"Great customer service, reasonable prices, and superb coffee. This little gem in Old Town is better quality than Starbucks and more approachable than Cartel. Their vanilla latte is simple, delicious, and made with real vanilla syrup. The salads and sandwiches are overpriced for what you get but I don't make a habit of stopping by for lunch. A morning cup with a pastry is all I need from this quaint coffee shop."}
{"text":"This is a great little find in old town.  I'm not a coffee drinker but I love the delicious fresh squeezed lemonade -- homemade every day!  If you're an Arnold Palmer fan, I would suggest the lemonade with hibiscus iced tea.  Their sandwiches are decent and I love that they use fresh crunchy baguettes.  My favorite is the caprese sandwich.

It's a small space with only the barista bar and a display case full of amazing looking pastries.  When it's nice out, they have a some great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This place brings in awesome pastries every day, they also had a nice little lunch menu. All their juices are freshly made and their coffees are top of the line. The best little local coffee place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a refreshing beverage after a morning meeting and ordered their iced black tea! It is delicious! They also serve local doughnuts from Born & Glazed. I will be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee and great food!  I'm so happy I stumbled upon this gem.  What a great little place with friendly staff and excellent coffee/espresso and food.  I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu.  The breakfast burrito was delicious and so was the yogurt parfait.  My Americano with almond milk was perfect...not burnt or too watered down and perfect temp.  I definitely would recommend Comoncy.

My yogurt parfait was very full and I thought worthy of the $6 price.  It seems like they took the posted tip to heart and made changes."}
{"text":"We ordered the picture yummy breakfast burrito which really did not taste anything. 
Since it is also owned by next door Dakota that we could choose to sit indoors in Dakota's dining area which is so much better than what Comoncy offers."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here religiously just about every morning and I get the same thing every time! I love the Comoncy for their great customer service! I walk my dog here with me and they always keep him in mind by giving me an extra water cup! Daniel and Germann are awesome! They provide exceptional service everyday! Unfortunately I'm moving soon but I will still make it a point to stop by often!"}
{"text":"We've walked by this place a while back.  Usually don't buy groupons any more but received an email for this place and decided to try.  We has a chicken and turkey sandwich.  Both came with salads.  Very tasty with fresh toasted bread.  No seating except outside or the restaurant next door.  We selected the restaurant next door as it was warm outside.  Plan to return for a coffee next time."}
{"text":"Yet another hipster coffee shop offering expresso latte and cappuccino. 
They also have a juicer while you wait. 
Service is friendly but slow. It's a counter top service with no seating inside. 
If you insist on free trade and organic, this is your place. 
If your traditional, it is not your place."}
{"text":"Four stars for service and two for the food, for an average rating of three stars.  My friend and I attended a special pop-up event and waited in line for an hour.  The wait wouldn't have been too bad, had the food tasted as good as it looked.  

French toast was more like a toasted baguette with berries and cream.  I asked for maple syrup but ended up eating very little.  Perhaps, they ran out of eggs and cinnamon to batter the bread?  Who knows?  I was disappointed.

Avocado toast was a bit better. My friend and I both ordered a serving. We decided the avocado spread was store bought, which is fine.  I like a bit more seasoning but we were starving and eagerly devoured it.

I might give Comoncy another try if I'm in the neighborhood and stick to chai and a pastry."}
{"text":"The Comoncy in my opinion has the best coffee in the old  town and dare I say even Phoenix as well. They also offer smoothies and organic coffee as well as food. The Comoncy is attached to the Dakota night club and is owned by the Dakota which is another fantastic place no matter what time of the day it is. The staff there is also very friendly and outgoing. The reason I'm not giving this a 5 star review is because of lack of parking. It's on a side street and there is no parking lot. Depending on how busy it is, you may have a little hike on your hands. They do have outdoor seating. The Comoncy and also they Dakota are very stylish and picturesque. Basically if you want great coffe, food, or are wanting to do some day drinking then this is the place to be. As an extra added bonus it's a hop skip and jump from old town and fashion square and convieniently right next to yelps offices."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about this place.  The sandwiches and the mixed green side salad are priced way higher than their worth - though you get like a full quarter cup of dressing for like 20 leaves of lettuce.  The steak sandwich was pretty bland and not very special.  My friend got the chicken sandwich which was better, but they toast the bread so it really cuts into your mouth trying to eat it.  I'd rather go to Jimmy Johns and hit a Starbucks.  Maybe the protein shakes are better?"}
{"text":"I stopped in one morning before heading to yoga and enjoyed an orange and mango juice.  Friendly staff, nice space and tasty, fresh squeezed juice!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for this small cafe. Well worth it. I paid 8 bucks for 20 dollars worth of food and coffee. They are a small cafe attached to a larger restaurant. I ordered the egg sandwich and it was delightful. It was a large sandwich and came with Delicious potatoes. My husband ordered the breakfast burrito and said it was good. He said it would have been bland if it didnt come with a side of salsa. Both dishes were 8 bucks. Their iced coffee was good and cost 4 bucks. I would absolutely eat here again. Their donuts looked amazing!"}
{"text":"First time in, no greeting when I walked in even though only one other customer there and then the coffee ended up being barely lukewarm. Positive was that the guy working was polite and well groomed."}
{"text":"Expensive. But I love the chicken panini. Fresh and tastes great. We do need to talk about the price of an iced tea. 4.32? Are you serious?!? Please lower the price of the tea, that's insane."}
{"text":"This is a to go breakfast place. There are a few tables outside. It's overpriced for what you get. The food was good, but portions were tiny. We were hungry again shortly after leaving."}
{"text":"This is a new eatery that opened up inside of the AZ Galleria.  I had an arugula salad with chicken the other day - it was pricey in my opinion.  It was a lot of greens, barely any chicken, and a strand of hair.  The lemonade was good though.

Today, I ordered Eggs Tartine and a hot chai latte.  The eggs were good, the \"good butter\" didn't taste like anything, and there wasn't any avocado spread.  I actually didn't have anything green in my box of food, a little disappointing for $8 bucks.  My hot chai latte?  For $4.50, it tasted like water.  Was there any chai in it?  I'll never know.

I also waited longer than I should have to get my food.  I saw the cook put my order out, and all the runners just kind of stood around wondering what to do.  One cashier stood next to another lady watching her put ice into a cup while my food was getting cold.  I understand this is a new joint, but maybe the cooks can somehow alert the runners the food is ready?  Like, \"ORDER UP!\"  Or maybe the runners can be more attentive to the pending food orders that everyone is ordering to keep an eye out for it?

For now, I think I'm going to hold off on spending any more money here.  The convenience is great since it's right outside of my office, but the price for the kind of food/drinks you get?  It's not worth it."}
{"text":"This is a huge disappointment. They found a way to make kale and bran muffins even more boring and mundane, the faux hipster vibe does not translate to anything but a vision less menu made by what I can only assume was designed by someone with skinny jeans and clinical depression. Please close this place now and put in some real food. This does not even qualify as a food. 1 star only because I have to."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey, but it's in down town Scottsdale and hard to find for the public, so it's understandable. The food is pretty good, I really like the Chicken Panini and the Egg-cellent sandwich. 

The reason for 3 stars? Simple.. there is one dude here who just seems to suck the life out of everything. Both times I've been here he just seems really depressed. I can understand how life can be stressful and bring you down, but yo have to learn to put your work mode on. It was so obvious it affected the other employees, no one wanted to talk to each other and as a customer it was actually awkward as I waited for food today. 

The basic customer service here is really lacking, but I'm convinced it's due to this one guy. If I had to take a guess he is the manager. He took my order and handed me my
Order but didn't thank me for taking my business here, said nothin about me tipping and I even felt he ignored other customers after me who came up waiting to order and instead waited for others to notice and help. At one point he was literally standing behind the counter, motionless, staring at nothing and not moving for over a minute. 

Not a great look for a customer stand point to seem so completely disconnected from your environment. Whatever was going on in their life I'd have to assume it was pretty major and if it was I hope they are ok. Just know what you do, or don't do, can really be obvious to customers."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Thursday morning for coffee because it was close to where we were staying. No complaints about the coffee, espresso, prices, or friendliness of the servers. But two espresso drinks took 15 minutes apiece to emerge from behind the counter. Yelp apparently has office space here and the place was swarming with Yelp employees, who had their own register and everything. Be forewarned: if the counter looks overrun with hipsters, then try someplace else."}
{"text":"I normally call in breakfast orders when I don't feel like cooking. My husband and I love the breakfast burrito. The price is great for the portion size."}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place was open at 8am because it seems like all of Downtown Scottsdale doesn't open until 11am or later! My friend and I were here for a girls weekend and we are early birds and wanted brunch but we were ready to roll around 9am and nothing was open except for Comoncy. The guys working were super nice and the coffee was delicious! The breakfast bagels were also amazing! Perfect start to a fun, drinking day ;)"}
{"text":"You'll have better luck going somewhere else for breakfast. The coffee (specifically the vanilla latte) was absolutely terrible. It tasted burnt; my blind granny could have made a better cup with no hands. 

The breakfast burrito was mediocre. The chorizo was its' saving grace, but besides that, it lacked flavor. At least it didn't taste burnt too! 

Overly expensive for mediocre food. Save your money for a bunch of lottery tickets instead."}
{"text":"Super dirty tables, trash over-flowing, juice-making station was so dirty that I hesitate if I should drink mine. Sandwich and salad took super long for no one here. Much better options in Scottsdale, especially for the price. Food is good but you need to work on ambiance."}
{"text":"Located inside of an office building, this location's ambiance can only be as good as the location it resides in. So for that, I won't take it into consideration. 

This may be odd, but I hate coffee. For me, it is all about the iced chai latte. Being a huge fan of chai (I get it at every coffee shop I can, and I make it myself with Teavana tea), I generally judge a place on it. 

Comoncy's chai is simply delicious. While it does come from a concentrate (like most chain shops), I find their ratio of concentrate to milk to be perfect. Not to much, not to little. I have been having it every day for the last few months (I work in the building) and it is always consistent. 

The only thing I sometimes run into is the occasional \"meh\" attitude of the staffing. As ambiance and feel of the coffee shop can't be changed, that means the quality of the product and attitude of the staff needs to be top notch. I found that on more than one occasion the staff walks up, takes the order and walks off with an air of burden for me ordering. It isn't everyone, just a few of their baristas. Kind of off putting. 

For full disclosure with this review, I am also not taking into account the cost of the drink. As I work in the building, I receive a discount and therefore don't want to mislead any potential customers based on said discounted price."}
{"text":"This is a nice little coffee shop nestled in the heart of Scottsdale's entertainment district.

I used my Yelp checkin to upgrade my small drip coffee to a large and had one of their muffins which were both OK.

Service was friendly and the weather was nice enough to sit outside at one of the tables in front of the store."}
{"text":"Comoncy left a lot to be desired. I had heard good things so we decided to walk there from our nearby apartment to have breakfast and work on our laptops for a bit. 

When we first arrived we noticed they actually don't have any tables inside, which we thought was odd. It wasn't too cold today so we decided it would be fine to eat outside. The cashier assured us that they had wifi. 

While we were deciding what to order, we let a security guard from Dakota go ahead of us, and he ordered two blended drinks which took the single employee a while to make. So we waited, while silently contemplating going somewhere else, but we stayed since we walked and didn't feel like walking another 20 minutes elsewhere. Once it was our turn to order, I asked how much one of the drinks in the beverage cooler costs, and got a response of \"something like $3, I don't know.\" Ok... So I asked him how a few things were on the menu and again heard \"I don't know.\" I guess he's vegan, but as the only employee at this business, it would be good to at least be armed with some points about each dish even if he hasn't tried them. 

I ordered the egg sandwich with a cup of water and my boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito and a drip coffee. 

We went to sit outside to start working, but the speakers outside were blaring club music mixed with sports reporter/some kind of sports game. We got out one laptop but the wifi was excruciatingly slow - we couldn't even connect. It took us about 3 minutes to decide there was no way we were staying, and we regretted ordering. So I went inside to ask for our orders to go, but there was no one around, so I waited. When the employee came out, he had already bagged our orders for us, which made me feel even more unwelcome. We left, and won't be back.

As far as the food itself. The breakfast burrito was really plain, even with homemade salsa, with barely any cheese or meat (mostly eggs and potatoes). It's served with potatoes on the side (mixed yukon, purple, and sweet potatoes) which were good, however, the sweet potatoes were undercooked. The egg sandwich was also fine but I could have easily made both of these things at home and a better cup of coffee. We felt it was overpriced for what we got.

There are a lot of coffee shops in the area. We came here because it was close enough for us to walk, but I wish we went somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the Old Town area early in the morning and in need of caffeine or fresh squeezed juice, Comoncy is your place!

With the Yelp office just steps away from Comoncy, I find myself frequently visiting for my americano with steamed almond milk or a fresh squeezed juice.

Staff is friendly and there is one gentleman that is super knowledgeable about the earl grey tea!  There are a few tables of outdoor seating, and you can likely take your drink next door to sister-restaurant, Dakota (attached).  That being said, I recommend coming here and getting your drink to-go.  It's perfect for that.

If you're in a pinch for some solid food, they have a light menu as well.  I have yet to order at Comoncy, but I've had some quality lunches at Dakota."}
{"text":"This Comoncy location, located inside the Galleria Building where I work, is a super convenient option for coffee, breakfast and lunch.  I'd guess the majority of the customers here are employees from businesses inside the Galleria, but it likely gets a tad bit of outside traffic as well.  My husband actually comes in on occasion for their quality coffee, convenient location, and of course so he can possibly see me in the middle of a busy work day!

The staff here are pretty friendly -- many of them remember me by name, which is always a nice surprise.  For beverages here, I recommend going for an americano, chai tea latte, or dirty chai.  Hot or cold, you cannot go wrong with any of those.  I typically request almond milk when it's in stock, but they have a variety of milk options to choose from.  You can't go wrong with the hot chocolate here if you want something sweet!

For food, I've had their oatmeal and avocado toast - both pretty decent and filling for breakfast.  I tend to go for their Chopped or Quinoa Salad when I'm too slammed at work to leave the building for lunch.  They are both good for healthy fuel, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for these if I didn't work in the building.

If you're not an employee taking food / beverage to your desk, there is plenty of comfortable seating options in the atrium of the Galleria now... if you're reading this and want to meet me here sometime, let me know!

I'm really happy to have this Comoncy so close by and convenient.  Thanks to all of the Comoncy staff for the service with a smile... especially on days that I come in before I've had my coffee ;)"}
{"text":"I'm visiting on business and got an Americano with steamed coconut milk (awesome) and a BYOB build your own bowl that is even more awesome. You can basically have them put in what you want over egg whites. I wondered if what I selected wouldn't go together but because I selected what I like, it's good!"}
{"text":"A little annex to the Dakota. Delicious sandwiches and tasty Arnold Palmer.
We ate in the Dakota's seating area as Comoncy has no seating, and they must serve all their food as 'take out' as our food came in a bag with the meals in take out containers.
This section of Scottsdale's Old Town is 'Club' row, the entire block is bars with loud music which is great if that's the mood you're in."}
{"text":"Really bad coffee and some of the people are rude that work there. I asked some questions and got a snooty response. There are much better coffee places, this place makes everything way too strong."}
{"text":"Great place!  The Ibooster juice is deeelish!  The mocha + vanilla lattes are incredible!  They have a nice menu with some really good breakfast items. Very friendly service and clean, organized appearance.  Went on a Saturday morning and only a few other people there.  Sorry, here's the bad part :: Parking is *awful.*  I'm not from this area, and almost did not go because of the lack of parking.  I ended up parking over a block away in a restaurant's lot that had a sign threatening to tow non-customers.  They weren't open yet so it worked out.  If you're wanting to get items to go, try bringing someone with you and drop them off while you drive circles."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and friendly staff. Not much in the way of soda. Lots of coffee to choose from."}
{"text":"Visited here the morning of 10/5/2016. Pretty easy review, Location is good, Coffee is good, Staff leaves a lot to be desired. Seemed annoyed, inattentive, not much in the way of customer service, or warmth."}
{"text":"I brought my parents here for breakfast, only because I've seen good reviews, and there was a Groupon available. I'd never been here before, and probably won't return. 
It's an odd place. I didn't realise it was short-order until we came through the door. You order at the counter, and sit outside. There is no indoor seating available. But they do bring your food out to you. 
Make sure you look at the menu up on the wall, because there is more there, than listed on the paper menu on the countertop. I wish I had realized that before ordering, for I was disappointed with the limited selection on the paper menu. 
The Rosemary potatoes that come with the breakfast sandwich tasted a little like dirt, as if they didn't wash them before cooking them. The breakfast bowl was pretty good, but would be better and more flavourful if they used the whole egg instead of just the whites. The fresh pressed juices are amazing, and the organic coffee is very nice, but very strong.
The employees were very friendly, but not very professional. While we were outside eating, the barista left as if she were going shopping, and the only other person behind the counter was outside on his phone. My mom went inside to ask for more napkins and some ketchup. The guy ran inside to see what she needed, while still on the phone, handed her a couple napkins and ran back outside, on his phone, without waiting to see if she needed anything else. She didn't get the chance to ask for ketchup. 
All in all, I wasn't impressed with the food, and it was a little pricey, but I would come back (maybe) for the juices and coffees."}
{"text":"Comoncy is a treat! Wonderful staff with spot-on recommendations.  I had the Sonora salad, and wow! Really delicious.  A great little cafe. As there are so many more salads, pastries, and drinks to try ... I'll be back frequently."}
{"text":"I loved the look of this little place.  No inside seating on the coffee shop side, there is adorable outside seating.  Weather was lovely the day I was visiting.  I enjoyed my blended coffee and meal.  I did feel they were a bit slow to the point that I was wondering if they had remembered I had ordered a sandwich, but over all it was it was a nice refreshing lunch."}
{"text":"the physical size of this spot is small. it's. it really a spot you could sit and do homework. the coffee is great pretty smooth taste right temp. the baristas were very friendly. the large is the size of a medium at most other places keep this in mind."}
{"text":"good coffee.  Tasty sandwich/salad combos for lunch."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for work and decided to stop in for breakfast. The food was great and the coffee was excellent. I am a total coffee snob and wary about trying new places outside of my local spots in Los Angeles (seriously, I won't even go to Starbucks or Coffee Bean). My almond milk latte was exceptionally good. I passed the word along to my Scottsdale friends and will definitely return when I am in town. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I come here maybe 4-5 times a week. Love their cold brew coffee and breakfast sandwiches. The guys are all so nice - hi Tyler! Thanks for amazing service."}
{"text":"I happened to ran into this little gem while exploring old town, it's part of The Dakota which is a restaurant and night club in old town Scottsdale. You definitely can't miss the cute bright orange decor, it has minimum outdoor seating, so if you must you can also sit in the Dakota lounge since they are together. Menus simple drinks, breakfast and lunch which include panini, sandwiches and wraps and also salads. I was in the mood for breakfast, and why not a burrito?! So I ordered the breakfast burrito, and a green tea. The inside is very small so if it gets crowded, then I hope your not claustrophobic. Menu is simple, you have your coffee drinks, teas and food menu is served all day. My serving of the burrito came with a side of potatoes or your choice of salad! I of course chose potatoes, it was really delicious and organic I think they were seasoned with rosemary not sure but it was my fave. Burrito was good, salsa was fantastic! Definitely check it out, if you need your extra coffee fix, and I believe they use local farm Ingredients, not sure about the coffee but I heard it was good, plus they have nitro which is a new coffee thing! Well get into that later on the next time I'll be here which will be soon! So come check it out tho!"}
{"text":"I love love love their muffins and vanilla lattes. I am obsessed ! This place is better then Starbucks. It's well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Gorgeous location! The food at this location is better than the other one and I don't know why people are complaining about prices, they are comparable to Chop Shop pricing but better quality food. Friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. My friend and I were looking for a quick place to get breakfast before our flight. Found it on Groupon, there food was good. The green juice was good too. I have a breakfast sandwich (Egg-celllent sandwich, I think it was called) and my friend had a chicken panini, she thought i was good. I liked that my egg sandwich came with the option of home fries or a lettuce salad, choose the lettuce, good light option. Over all good, I would go back."}
{"text":"Service awful.  Attitude when I ordered.  Didn't get my food order right and got even. more attitude.  No wifi, out of coffee- maybe it was just a bad luck day?? Regardless, I thought the food (salad and sandwiches) were overpriced. I could see why they were selling groupons!
Now for the positive- Delic Americano!! Strong and tasty and several parking spots right at front door for this place which was convenient"}
{"text":"I found their food to be overpriced and small portions. So disappointing in this nice new space."}
{"text":"Comoncy never fails to impress me. I've been on a juice kick lately and can't get enough of the i booster. Thanks Comoncy for making my day better"}
{"text":"This is my happy place. I love their drinks and their lunch and their muffins, I love it all!! The employees are friendly and remember my name. I have never been disappointed with an item I ordered here. I visit this location maybe too often, 2-3 times a week, since they moved into my direct work building. I love you Comoncy. I will never stop buying your Iced Vanilla Latte's. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Super cute space with some potential to be great. We walked up to the counter and no one greeted us. We were the only ones there and there were three workers behind the counter. Once we got our food - one order was wrong and the other one was incomplete. The food was good, but the prices are high for what it is. ($8 for plain bagel with egg and cheese)?! I probably wouldn't return again unless it's in a pinch."}
{"text":"Newest Comoncy location located inside the Galleria. They are still working out things with a new opening but were receptive to my feedback when a mistake was made which I appreciate.

I still prefer the Comoncy across the street just because I've bee going there regularly and the baristas know me and my order. I also notice the food is not consistent with each location nor are the prices. Prices are higher here."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Old Town!! The employees are great so is the manager. They know my order and always hook up their loyal customers. I love the quality of their coffee beans it's worth the price."}
{"text":"I don't usually race toward a chain restaurant/juicery for their coffee, but the pour-over at Comoncy was quite good!"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon and went to Comoncy to pick up lunch.  The parking around there is really BAD and I had to park several blocks away.  I ordered a chicken ciabatta and a beverly hills sandwich TO GO.  It comes with a salad.  Since it was TO GO, I would have figured that they would have put lids on the salad dressing....NO....by the time I got home, the dressing was spilled all over the container soaking the sandwiches and mushing up the salad.  What idiot doesn't put a lid on a liquid that is to go.  Then, the top bread on the chicken ciabatta was so hard that we had to toss out the top because we couldn't bite it and the bottom because it was soaked in salad dressing.  No more for this joint"}
{"text":"One star isn't about the breakfast burrito I had, which was well done (potatoes cubed, eggs and chorizo mixed nicely, balanced by home made salsa). 
No, this is because I ordered a latte, and when the barista started to tell me there were no espresso beans, he was cut off by the manager, who was pouring Ethiopian into the grinder. 

I guess she thought no one would notice. Problem is, I do. The classic espresso bite is replaced by a blasé finish that definitely isn't espresso. 
If you claim to be a coffee/espresso shop, show some integrity."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a refreshing iced latte that hit the spot. The staff were friendly and the fresh juices here looked pretty good too. It's a decent option if you're stuck staying at the horrible Aloft nearby."}
{"text":"What a great little coffee shop! The coffee beans have a nice balanced, but still robust flavor. All of their items have very high quality ingredients. They make their own vanilla syrup in house with actual vanilla beans. Who does that?!?? And their muffins are SOOOOO delicious! The employees are super nice. I really enjoy going here!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop right in the Entertainment District. Shares a door with Dakota. They serve excellent coffee, breakfast and lunch items. Everything is fresh and made-to-order. Their muffins and baked goods look very good as well. Today I had the breakfast burrito and it was very tasty. The salsa was mild but has good flavor. Will definitely keep going back. Close convenient reasonably priced with a helpful friendly staff"}
{"text":"Happy there's another local coffee shop in the old town hood!  Try their excellent cold brew coffee and their breakfast sandwich rocks.  Crisp thick, bacon, greens with egg on hearty bread hits the spot.  The Pastries I have tried are yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a great little local coffee shop.  I used to head over on breaks when I worked at the galleria corporate center. I no longer work there but I still like to head there for a great cappuccino. This coffee shop is attached to the bar restaurant called Dakota. Which is a gorgeously decorated place. There is some seating outside of comoncy but it's really more of a to go place. My boyfriend swears by the iced lattes.  I love the cappuccino with almond milk. Good coffee and prices aren't bad."}
{"text":"Closed the juice bar an hour early. Service was rushed and impersonal. Too many other coffee shops in the area vs. having to deal with poor service from someone who hates their job."}
