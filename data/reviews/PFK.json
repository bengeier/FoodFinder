{"text":"The food is good But the service and the way they treat people is AWFUL  The tables are dirty and Nobody cares about customers!!!!"}
{"text":"Over an 1h30min for my food delivery!!!! They warned me already that it will take up to an he but this is insane. I didn't even call during rush hour... Never again. I'll walk there next time if I have to"}
{"text":"Ok I admit I had to add this business myself. And that haven't eaten here for a long time. But we did this spiritual experience for our success regarding my own business and we \"jumped to an alternate universe\" meditatively speaking where the success I wanted was happening.   And there I met the \"alternate me\" and the alternate of the person I was doing this with and those already successful selves had us eating friend chicken because they said that would help bridge the difference in resonance between their vibrations and ours.  So we did that on the spiritual plane and then they told us all this amazing stuff about how they got the success already that we still wanted.   When I came out I was so motivated. And I thought why not actually eat some fried chicken and that's how for the last few weeks while my business has been changing in a huge way due to that \"inner trip\" I can't say it is also not because I have been picking up a bucket at KFC just about every week.  They really do make delicious friend chicken. OK if you are into raw foods or you fine cuisine this is probably a very disturbing review but I have to admit the spiritual pleasure and fun and the drastic actual change in my business in such a short time has me playing along. So  I just had to review it! I will always remember this KFC when I am living that success we were only dreaming of.  :)  One of the things that tangibly happened from playing with all this is that within days we had designed a new box for our product. http://Elprehzleinn.com And I got to thinking as I went to kfc repeatedly as the weeks unfolded about the success of their business and how the box and the bucket are so much a part of their image.  What was my alternate universe self trying to tell me leading me here?"}
{"text":"Over an hour on a Tuesday night around 9 pm to get cold food and a still frozen dessert delivered. They didn't even get the dipping sauces right.Less than six blocks away from the restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to think 'there was no such thing as bad fried chicken'. I was wrong - when I lived in Toronto, the KFC there was incredibly sub-standard - wasn't fresh, soggy batter, bland - and it lead me to quit it.   Fast-forward to NDG KFC, I decided to try my luck after something like 3-4 years without the Colonel in my life. The good KFC of old is present in this particular chain - they have the magic. Very, very tasty - fried chicken you cannot complain about. In fact, it makes me wonder whether all KFC's have undergone a change - or whether this one is in fact special. 4/5 in light of the fact that we are still talking about fast food fried chicken, and that I still prefer a good Popeye's."}
{"text":"Ordered the four piece meal, three dark and one white piece came in the meal.  The white piece a wing, was the same size as the wet wipe package that you get there( I took a picture). I'm from Vancouver, you definitely get good sized pieces there."}
{"text":"Attendre 15 min pour une assiette de poulet et frites a 10$.  Pire service que j'ai jamais eu dans un \"fast\" food de tout mon existence.  Les employés jase de leur histoire personnel quand que ya du monde dans file. Aucun cr*ss de respect."}
{"text":"Unequivocally, this is the most disgusting, filthy restaurant I have ever set foot in North America. I used to frequent this establishment many years ago when working in the neighbourhood, but what a dive it has become. Seriously, if upper management of KFC/Taco Bell want a heads up on what will tarnish their brand, they need to visit this establishment.  On a recent visit when my family decided to get a quick bite for supper, KFC had not been one of our choices for some time, so with this branch close by, that is where we headed. With dinner on our mind, the last thing we felt the need to check was the cleanliness of the restaurant. However, once inside waiting for our order is when things went south, way south!!  The first thing that caught our attention was the outward view through the filthy windows. Fingermarks on the doors, grease stains from people's hair leaning on the bay window, the greasy counter that serves our meals on trays, you can see the smudge patterns. Then you notice the slippery floor. No rain had fallen for several days, so why are they so slippery?  At the soft drink fountain, my choice for Dr. Pepper dispensed only carbonated water. I advised an employee of this, only to be met with a 'fix it when we have time' response.   We slid down the eating area until we drifted into our seat choice only to find out the unit is not bolted to the floor. Looking around for something more comfortable, we had to stay put. Now for the worst, most offending part.  \"The following description may be offensive to younger viewers...discretion advised.\"  Before I eat a meal at any restaurant, no matter how basic or posh it may be, I always like to eat with clean hands. As I walked down the small hallway towards the washrooms, you can't help notice the walls are filthy, paint and wall surfaces dirty and chipped, looks like the last time it was cleaned, let alone painted was 20 years ago!! Even before opening the men's room, a strong presence of urine was emanating through the crack of door space. Once in the room, a very dirty sink, walls and floor were no match to the urinal that looked like it has not been cleaned in months. The flush device did not work, so lord knows how many guys just did their business with no way of flushing. The powerful stench of ammonia had me gagging that I literally had to breath without my nose long enough to wash my hands after using the toilet.  When leaving the restaurant, you can't help notice the greasy door frames, smudged windows and concrete step outside where traces of grease have collected, along with dust in the air to create an asphalt like appearance. The entrance doors have considerably less grease, since most people are arriving without grease on their shoes.  I work in building maintenance. If I had left my washrooms at 5 percent of filth as a guide from this restaurant, I WOULD BE FIRED!!  I filled out the online survey KFC provides, when asked: \"Would you return to this restaurant?\" My answer: \"NO\". \"Would you tell someone else not to go to this restaurant?\" \"YES\" \"Please provide the reasons for your response.\" I replied as much as I could within the short timeframe allowed by the survey, but heard noting in return.  I will not be back until I have heard from KFC/Taco Bell or will have the chance to see first hand this establishment's makeover of both real estate and management's commitment to a client's most desired eating experience.  I have no choice but to award one star to finish this review even if I wanted to give no awards for the food, since the other elements cancel any merit."}
{"text":"My family and I made a stop here late in the evening for a snack as we were on a road trip from Toronto to Montreal.  We came in to order a bucket of chicken.  When my niece proceeded to order the cashier was very abrupt with her telling her to wait as he was waiting for the person in the drive thru to finish paying.  How did we know that you were busy when you were standing at the register with no one else in line? Other than that service was okay.   The menu was in French but we were able to figure out what they had.  All KFCs pretty much have the same menu.  However, being close to Montreal they did have chicken poutine, which looked pretty good.  The dining area is large and the washroom was clean.  However, it does need an updated decor."}
{"text":"Twas horrible. Waited 2.67 hours for the delivery. Cold, soggy, unappetizing food through and through. Disappointment is in the air. IF YOU WANT EVEN A MEDIOCRE FOOD EXPERIENCE, DO NOT ORDER FROM KFC."}
{"text":"Terrible place.  Went here for the 11.99$ double combo consisting of two BLT, two Super-Croque, or one of each.  They charged me 1$ extra for the BLT despite the coupon said otherwise. The manager's crappy explanation was \"if we don't charge the extra 1$ we're losing money.\" And she even gave me attitude like I shouldn't even bother to ask.  Seriously? This is a franchise, not a home-owned sugar shack, where are the consistencies?  It's not about the money, it's about sending a message.  Guess who's not coming back? Losing money? No s***."}
{"text":"The place is alright, chicken is actually not dry at all and well cooked. The seasoning is not overwhelming and the chicken doesn't taste very salty at all (unlike other KFCs). My only problem with this place is that there is no A/C during summer, so eating indoors would not be comfortable at all.  It also has a Taco Bell menu, but the \"tacos\" are disgusting, get the chicken instead."}
{"text":"I know this is a fast food place but how hard is it to have them keep the place somewhat clean. This is the only place around where I live that I can go to enjoy my once in a while Taco Bell fix. I use to be in Ontario and they have tons there but here not so much. The place is dirty, the drink machine is always down so if this happens when you go you get a warm can of Pepsi. The wait is beyond unbelievable and after waiting so long you get your order and 7/10 the order is wrong."}
{"text":"Not really a KFC fan at all,  though i do occassionally enjoy a fine piece of fried chicken once in a blue moon, the last time i had some KFC was when there was a KFC located on Provost which is now a Subways, so quite a long time ago, well i went yo this one not far from the Vendome metro, i was glad i came to this one, nice fresh pieces and the chicken was seasoned just right. Only complaint it was tiny and hot inside, and thry gave me a wrong salad. Overall i might return to this one in the future for my kfc craving."}
{"text":"first off mixing 2 menu's is freaking ridiculous taco bell / kfc in the same building  is cause for a social melt down ...   note this place has it hard they are in the middle of a over populated ghetto .. so costumer politeness is far down the scale when it comes to this place .. even though faced with rude clients and a multitude of different languages the staff is always smiling and pleasant. but due to the high volume of clients they can not get quality down . the food was greasy  and made you feel regretful for ordering  the famous kfc sauce was so bad I thew it out (I NEVER THROW ANYTHING OUT ) .. if you decide to eat at kfc there is one on st terese the chef Vivian loves her job and you can taste it in everything you order not over greasy and delicious"}
{"text":"I was craving grub after work, so decided to walk to the kfc around the corner. I knew this was going to be a chicken coop - small, crammed - yet a ridiculous line up. (Take away only). One of the customers was upset because she was served cold popcorn chicken, another mom of 2- sees her food and comments \"this isn't food anyone would feed the living!\" But points for the staff for trying to accomodate them both serving an extra slice of bread? Lol   When it was my turn to order I picked the 5$ special with a chicken burrito- side of fries and popcorn chicken. Surprisingly, I came to know that they changed their fluorescent radioactive green coleslaw I loved eating (RIP coleslaw) so I went to my second go to - macaroni salad. Which all cost less than 8$. As I went to the fountain drink to get iced tea- the machine wouldn't stop spraying! And it wasn't even iced tea! But a mix of coke and orange crush! Somehow we got the crazy machine to stop. I saved a life or two lol   Don't come here expecting service, a proper meal but a good story over fried piece of chicken!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of KFC really.    We get it twice a year - my kids like a bucket on their birthdays (classy, huh?).     I always say I don't want to eat it because I already like the size of my butt as is plus I'm pretty sure whatever is in their gravy will kill me. That said.....I love it the two times a year that I have it. Once the last bite is swallowed, I start to feel terrible and yell at my husband, \"Oh, why did I eat that?   I think I'm dying!\"     I've heard that there are people who can eat this stuff on the regular but I have a hard time believing it.    But.....every once in a blue moon, scrap your diet and your morals and go get some KFC  :-)  This branch has no seating and the worst customer service, but let's be serious.....if you're in line there, it's not because you want to make a new friend, so just let it go."}
{"text":"Called ahead and was told they opened at 10:30 but when we got there, although the doors were open, they said they couldn't serve for 30 minutes. For the inconvenience the gave us an extra piece if chicken and a free salad.   Very nice of them.  The meal was very good."}
{"text":"Ok.  You haters have to stop picking on this location.  I've been here several times and have always had very good service and the food is always good.   It such a shame that people can just write nasty reviews because they want to hurt someone's reputation.  Grow up!"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 hours ago, still waiting. Called customer service, on hold 10 minutes. Called the restaurant, the young french girl who answered defensively blurted out, \"Yes, yes it's already left!\" before I could even tell her which address I was calling for. After waiting another 40 mins from then, I called customer service back, only to be told that after speaking with the restaurant my order was never even received, in actuality, according to them. This, 40 minutes after being told my order had already left. Grander incompetence I know not of. As I told the cust serv rep, KFC should invest in proper training for their employees. Disgraceful. I've worked in the restaurant industry 20 years, this is unheard of in a respectable, professional business. Yes, even if it's 'fast food.'"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, I had not heard anything for 91 minutes, then I called and was left on hold for another 9 minutes. They said they were busy and had no idea when they could deliver. They offered me 50% off on my next purchase, a completely inadequate compensation for being left waiting for 1h40 min without communication."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and didn't have very high expectations but the fries were hot and crispy, chicken finger licking good and fresh and hot, gravy so delicious I could drink it. Cole slaw a little heavy on the horseradish for our liking but not bad. Corn a little strange tasting to us but I can still say we will be regular customers. Excellent delivery person very polite."}
{"text":"How was my zinger you ask? It was scrumptious. Definitely worth the 40 minute wait. Popcorn chicken was fried to perfection. Can you say mouth orgasm?"}
{"text":"I never understand why I keep doing this to myself, it seems to me I am a glutton for punishment.   As usual every once in a while I have this craving that I can only satisfy with PFK as they call it here. I order the Barrel 8 pc,  popcorn chicken and fries, I get home and start sampling the popcorn chicken, it was as expected, nice and tasty. So far so good. I jump to the chicken, the breast piece was ok  and then i move on to the thigh (my favorite) and after one bite, the taste didn't seem right. I smell it, didn't smell right either. The color was a little off and the meat was dark. I assumed the piece was bad, so i skip it and try another and another and all the same.  It was either bad or not cooked, regardless. I ended up dumping the remainder of the barrel. Out of 8 pieces, i had maybe 2 breast pieces. (1 good and the other super dry)   TLDR;  Popcorn Chicken was good. Fries were ok, not great Salads were good Chicken was very bad (1 good piece out of 8)  Never again, until my next craving in a couple of months."}
{"text":"When it comes to Taco Bell, I don't expect a spectacular dining experience because it's just a fast food joint after all. But I do get Taco Bell cravings occasionally and since this is the only place in town, I headed over to Côte-Vertu for some inauthentic Mexican food.   I had checked the reviews beforehand so I knew what to expect, but it really wasn't that bad. Sure the place looks run down and is not especially clean but the food was A-OK. The tacos were warm and crunchy and tasted pretty much the same as other Taco Bell places I've been to. When we arrived there was about 10 people in line ahead of us and the wait time to order and get our food was fine. Maybe 10 minutes in total. Again, very standard Taco Bell experience.  I'll have no problem going back there next time I want to indulge in some Doritos tacos locos."}
{"text":"This location had closed last year (thank God!) and the building was demolished. They built a new building and it's now split, KFC and Thai Express. Luckily they hired a brand new staff to go along with the building as most of the former employees were lazy, looked unkept and shady. I visited the new location last week and was pleasantly surprised. It's  very bright and clean. The staff seemed friendly and provided fast service and the chicken was spot on, not overcooked as the old KFC at that location used to do. I'm  hoping it stays this way! It's  goof to have a decent KFC in the West Island again."}
{"text":"I went to this KFC/PFK after not having been to a KFC/PFK in over 5 years. I had seen ads on television for their $5 meal deals and decided to give that a try.  The line wasn't too long on the day that I went. I ordered and paid with my credit card. There were ~5 meals to choose from and I picked the meal which involved a drink, bread, fries, one white chicken meat, and a chocolate chip cookie.  I can't really complain about anything since it is a typical KFC and typical fast food restaurant except the place doesn't have WiFi (free or otherwise). There was also no electrical outlets in the dining area where you can eat and charge your cellphone at the same time.  In terms of the soft drink, it is a self serve fountain for the soft drink and they allow for refills. I didn't go to the washroom so can't comment on that. The floor was a bit sticky.  I'll rate them as 3 stars."}
{"text":"Service: passable Fries: limp and flavorless Gravy: slop Chicken: Mediocre at best.  I ate half a burger, one drumstick and a few fries dipped in gravy. At least I never have to worry about this craving again..."}
{"text":"The place is dingy and only for take aways. No place to sit and eat.. Only 2 people - a cashier and a girl in the kitchen preparing the orders. Yet they were quick and managed the crowd well with their friendly enthusiastic attitude. Giving it all stars for friendliness and quick processing of our huge order despite the never ending queue of people placing large orders before and after us! Burgers, fries, chicken pieces were fresh and tasty. They even adhered to the discounts on the KFC app! Really impressed. Hope it never closes!   Just ticked a star off because of the ambiance. Looked dingy."}
{"text":"I understand that it is important to have respect because the people are catering to your order, however, when the order takes over an hour to arrive, only to find that you are missing sauces and your drinks that you paid for, it is quite annoying, especially as I reiterate a hour and half long wait.  I call to inform them of this and was hung up on, I called again, they picked up, and again hung up.   Very bad service, disappointing to say the least.  Never again"}
{"text":"Pas fort! 1)J'ai commandé un trois morceaux avec salade de chou. J'ai reçu une boîte avec 3 mini morceaux tout sec et trop cuit... 2) la toilette des hommes est infecte. Pas de papier de toilette n'y de papier à main. Le lavabo m'a carrément levé le cur. Le plancher était recouvert d'urine à grandeur.  Je vous épargne le reste  Conseil! Ne passez pas par la toilette avant le repas ....."}
{"text":"Now that the Thai Express (which is connected to this KFC) is officially open, they have reopened their doors.  We went to pick up lunch yesterday, and it was incredibly busy for a Tuesday.  It took a bit of time to get our meals, but considering the amount of people, we understood.  The cashier was very polite and was remaining cool under the pressure of the growing line.  Our son loved playing with the decorations for their re-opening celebrations.  The food was what you would expect from a KFC; nothing too special but nice to have every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Chicken not as freshly fried as it should. Avoid this branch... Just not worth it"}
{"text":"Camebin close to closing time. They told me my order would be about a 20 minute wait. I told them that was fine. They then gave my son a platter of popcorn chicken because they didn't want him to wait too long to eat. This is excellent customer service. I will definitely return.   Food was great and served with a smile."}
{"text":"There is nothing good in this franchise. It took forever to just order. It took forever to get the food which was just a sandwich and they got it wrong. Also, none of the staff were wearing gloves, they were handling food with their bare hands. Disgusting place."}
{"text":"Under cooked cold chicken thigh, under seasoned bland chicken, tastes more like oil than chicken, cold hard fries, flat fountain soda, hmmm wonder what i should rate this. Only positive mention that I can give it that it has Taco Bell if the KFC part is a meal disaster. Can't go wrong with chilli cheese fries, but pretty sure you can since they use the KFC fries. Blah"}
{"text":"This location looks rather grim from the outside, and is only a pick-up spot with zero seating inside. The people waiting for their order have to sit by the window, and it looks like a grease lover's silent congregation, which can be a little intimidating.  When I visited last Sunday, one of the cooks was chatting up his girlfriend in the \"lobby\", and the lady taking our orders was very chatty. Good old Verdun. We had to eat in our car with a very nice view of the washed out reds of the building. The food was okay and plentyful. Verdun makes me wanna kill myself."}
{"text":"It's KFC and Taco Bell... I've had a few orders messed up and missing items. Slow service... Heard employees swearing and arguing. Very unprofessional. Not going back."}
{"text":"Bought 12 pieces of KFC on 16 May 2018. A few of the pieces were so small, as the pictures show. Buy at your own risk. Or stand at the counter and check the size of your chicken pieces before leaving. I will never buy from them again."}
{"text":"I had great service, the cashier serving me was so nice that this is my go-to KFC. It was a little slow, but she still did her best to serve me as quickly as possible"}
{"text":"Un de mes meilleurs PFK je fait toujours ben 25 minutes de voiture pour y aller :) nourriture toujours bonne jai jamais était malade à cette place la service à la caisse impeccable toujours le sourire"}
