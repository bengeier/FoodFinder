{"text":"Service was terrible. We waited over an hour and a half for our table. Not to mention, while waiting they gave our table away. The waitress claimed to have called us to let us know that our table was ready. But we didn't hear anything and they gave the table away to the group that was standing right beside us. Once we were seated they took forever to bring the food out. Food overall was alright. I honestly prefer going to the downtown location. I would probably not recommend anyone to eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"We waited for more than 30 mins being the second table to order at dinner time.  The space is very small and tight. The portion of an entrée is small for what we paid.  Food is nothing than ordinary with a distintive  presentation on a sizzling plate."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. 10/10 would never think about going again. We waited a full hour and 4 tables were seated before us. Eventually we waited long enough and no one came to us so we decided to leave. This was our first time here and definitely our last."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot better than Aka teppan their menu is a lot better now, way more options. I've already planned my next trip."}
{"text":"we went there for dinner for the first time. when we were ready to order, I called the waitress over, I already told her what dish I want, the waitress threw a pen and paper to me saying here you have to write it yourself in a very rude way then walked off. ?!?!?! I actually felt quite offended. she is the waitress with black glasses and wavy hair. the whole time I saw her there, she had her arms crossed, looking at her cell phone, and her face and expressions looked like she didn't want to be there. we were thinking wow wonder how long this restaurant would last.   then another guy started serving us, and he was fine.  we had to call to get our water refilled numerous times  foodwise, it is good food except my japanese squid balls were a bit burnt.  how does the story end?  that waitress never really provided much service to us, except when we paid, she was the first one who appeared within a minute to get the cash and tips from us. oh my gosh.  what an unpleasant first experience."}
{"text":"Hi guys, so today my gf and I went to Flaming Kitchen at First Markham Place. We were seated fairly quickly and the waitress promptly brought us our menus and water. We ordered the Seafood Pancake as an appetizer and as for our main dishes we got the Spicy Mentaiko Beef Udon and a custom made Udon with ox tongue, corn, kimchi, and Tom Yum sauce! The seafood pancake came pretty quickly and it was pretty yummy! The sizzling hot plate as well as the combination of flavours from the seafood, sauces, and the garnish was great. We then got our entrees shortly afterwards and we both enjoyed our meals very much. I personally loved the fact that the beef came rare so that you could cook it right on the hot plate! The sauce was a little heavy but quite good as a mix of spice and cheesiness, and my girlfriend's custom meal also turned out quite well. Overall, we had an enjoyable experience at Flaming Kitchen. The service was decent (had to call over the server a few times), the food came pretty quickly and it was all enjoyable. We would definitely come back for more next time! Wheee"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner. The wait time to be seated was not too bad, as they did seem quite busy. The wait time for the food however was ridiculous. It took about 40 minutes for my food to come out, then another 20 minutes for my boyfriends food to come out. Given how long  it took the food to come out, we decided to ask for the dessert when they brought my boyfriends food. By the time we finished our food, our dessert had still not been brought to us. When we asked about it, the server told us it's almost ready. This time my boyfriends dessert came first, about 10 minutes after our meal, and 30 minutes since we asked for it. My dessert did not come until we asked to cancel the order, about 15 minutes after my boyfriends dessert was brought to us.   Although I did enjoy the food, and would have wanted to come back to try some of the other items on the menu, the service was unbelievably slow and very disappointing. Unless you enjoy spending the majority of your time at a restaurant waiting for your food, I would definitely not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros: - nice seating arrangements (spacious, red booths). Large group hangouts (say, at night) is very possible - customizable savoury hot plates - diverse selection of food - some interesting dishes like cheesy rice cakes on hot plate  Cons:  - portions for the customizable savoury hot plates are kind of small for the price - the savoury hot plates are a bit simple - just spaghetti or rice plus one meat. Extra toppings/meats available but with additional costs  I'll still go again because the selection is quite interesting"}
{"text":"I didnt know they changed to flaming kitchen.  very clean place. but open very late."}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times. Twice on Midland, once at First Markham Place.   I first tried the Mentaiko Beef Udon but substituted the udon for ramen noodles. Flavour was delicious, and noodles were good however they were more like spaghetti noodles than ramen noodles but nevertheless was very good. I tried the Shake-Shake fries and found that the Wasabi powder they give you with it is AMAZING. Makes it so worth it, if you've ever gone to Singapore or HK and McDonald's had the seasoning powder you can add to their fries... You'll know what I'm talking about, very similar. The cumin lamb with rice dish was also good, but it's exactly as you would expect but the rice has a nice sauce in the center that gives the dish more flavour.  Onto dessert! The Yam and ginger soup was a bit disappointing, portions were a bit small and there was way too much ginger in the soup that I couldn't eat the yam. The sago with red beans is pretty standard but it did taste good. Lastly the matcha lava cake.. Liquidy center and a nice crust on the outside, paired with vanilla ice cream and some red bean definitely gets a pass in my book.  Prices are decent, portions for dinner are a good size. As it is very popular seating took a while at the FMP location but service was very quick, Midland is less populated so seating is easy but waiter service is a bit absent when you're looking for them, but once you get your order in, it comes out quickly. I'll definitely be visiting here again!  Overall experience is very good!"}
{"text":"For our weekly family dinner this past Sunday, we decided to try somewhere new and ended up here as they featured sizzling hot plates. You can customize your own plate by selecting the protein, sauce, rice or noodle, and add ons like egg, corn, etc or order one of their signature dishes. I decided to customize my own and ordered the duck breast with teriyaki sauce on rice and an egg. When the sizzling plate arrives, there is a paper ring around to protect you from splatter. I forgot to take a picture before I cracked the egg but I've been told that it's better not to wait. I then mixed it up to cook the egg and became a stir fried rice. The duck breast came already cooked. Portion size was good and really filling. There was five of us including myself and we shared the squid balls, takoyaki (octopus) balls and poutine. Everything was tasty and would definitely come back again. The restaurant is kind of small but we came just before the 7:00 pm rush."}
{"text":"Food is okay. It's just the wait time for the food is long. Wouldn't suggest going there when you are hungry!"}
{"text":"The food is decent but very expensive for kind of a small portion. The durian spring rolls were really good but the durian sweet dumplings was meh. I've had better popcorn chicken as well. I really wanted to try their matcha lava cake but they sold out so I will be coming back for that. The rice sets were just like any other rice set. I wouldn't crave this place but if I were in the area, I wouldn't mind coming back. The three stars is because of the price and portion of the food."}
{"text":"This place closes at 11... But started to clean up at 9:30. Was super unpleasant to eat while smelling cleaning supplies and seeing them set up their chairs. Lost my appetite after smelling it. Food wasn't anything special. Took more than half an hour to get our order when there was only two tables in the whole restaurant. Definitely won't want to come back if I don't have to."}
{"text":"Ever been out with friends and you're the only one who wants hot pot and they're looking at you like why....? That's me :)  I really like flaming kitchen cause it offers choice for everyone. And until their Midland location opened up, I had never heard of them.   My favorite here is their hot pot with milk soup base and lamb. And sometimes with extra squid balls. It's not cheesy at all and has a good milky flavour. The portions are also very good for 1 person.   Their shake shake fries are also ridiculous silly but yummy. I prefer wasabi.   Dessert is just okay. Worth trying if there's still room after all that food!"}
{"text":"This used  to be where Aka Teppan was. All the tables, chairs, cutlery, cups, and hot plates are the same. The menu however is much better. There's a lot of small snacks, drinks, dessert and food variety ! The menu has like 15 pages ! The food was also much tastier than it used to be. They even have a $40 wagu steak on the menu. I'm not sure how many people will be getting that, but I'm sure it's amazing.   The service wasn't bad either. The staff seem to be the same as the old restaurant. The service speed was not bad for a Monday and they were quite busy for soft opening.   The salty spicy fried squid balls and wasabi shake shake fries are a must try! This will def become one of my regular spots again."}
{"text":"I'm usually very reluctant to write a bad review but this experience just wasn't pleasant. We came here for my sister's birthday-- thought we'd give this place a try since it was close by and the photos looked delicious.   It was freezing in the restaurant - it didn't help that we were seated under a vent, which is fine cause sometimes that's just what you get. Asked for hot tea or hot water to keep warm while we waited for the food and received luke warm water from the tap .   Food came and it looked nothing like the photos in the menu. Quite frankly didn't taste that great either. Found a hair in one of our dishes and the waitress apologized and quickly requested another dish for us. However, she did not take away the dish with hair so it was quite unappetizing having a cheesy string of hair stare at us while we sat there freezing.   We finished our meal and had brought a cake to celebrate. What do you know, they refuse to give us a knife and plates. I don't think we've ever been to a restaurant, ever, that didn't allow cake cutting. Sure we've been places where they charge a cake cutting fee, but never a straight up \"no\". Such a great way to end our already not-so-great of an experience.   Don't think I'll be coming back here again. At least not to this location."}
{"text":"Came here to try their sizzling plates during their grand opening (15% off from July 26-31 when mentioning markhamfoodie,  mrs_dimsum, or some other IG foodies). Was not impressed.   Arrived around 12:40pm on a Friday afternoon and this place was packed. Luckily, there was one booth table left. There is barely any room between the seat and the table (not movable). I'm quite petite and I found it very uncomfortable already.   Ordered three sizzling plates: the chicken spicy noodles, salmon and shrimp rice, and black curry pork cutlet rice. Each were $11.99. Waited 45 minutes to 1 hour for the food to come. None of them met my expectations.   Chicken spicy noodles:  I already stated that I wanted less spicy and wrote it on the paper used for ordering. It was even stated on my receipt. I'm not sure how spicy it is regularly, but with less spicy it was still super duper spicy. Also, there is supposed to be cheese in this dish, but I could barely taste it. This noodles is more like spicy instant noodles without soup with a few bits of chicken. My throat is still hurting from this dish.   Salmon and shrimp rice:  This is the perfect representation of \"picture vs. reality food\". The picture in the menu looked like there are four big slices of salmon and four big shrimps (in Chinese it even translates into salmon and BIG shrimp rice). When it came, it was more like four teeny tiny pieces of salmon and four baby shrimps (see my picture). The salmon and shrimps were both extremely dry and salty even when eaten with the rice. In the middle of the rice there was a piece of butter which I wasn't aware of, so I almost puked when I ate it.   Black curry pork cutlet rice:  Meh. The curry was a very thick sauce. Not spicy at all (I like curry with a hint of spiciness). The pork cutlet was very thin pieces of pork that were breaded heavily. They were also soggy as they were drenched in the sauce. There was also a piece of butter in the rice and this time I knew better. This dish was the only one I could actually eat.   Wanted to order some durian desserts after, but we didn't want to wait another hour for them.  Service:  The waitress was very weird. She would say everything in Cantonese first, then after we responded, she would repeat what she said in English as if we didn't understand. Sometimes she would be speaking Mandarin to us. Also, when she asked if we wanted more water, without waiting for us to respond, she already poured it into the cup.   When I asked for the bill, I showed the waitress the Instagram post and told her about the 15% off and she kinda nodded. However, there was no discount on the receipt we received after. I called over the waiter and he looked at the Instagram post as if he never saw it before. Then he went back to reprint the receipt. This time, there was only 10% discount when the post clearly said 15%. I didn't have much patience left so I just paid and left.   Definitely will not be coming back as the food is not very good and also for that price, I can easily find much better tasting food. Also, I get that it is busy around lunch time, but why does it take an hour to make these dishes? The wait itself already left me with a terrible impression. With the food and service on top, I would only give 1 star."}
{"text":"Such a cool hang out spot! You leave here feeling very satisfied with a real bang for your buck jk not a bang but it's decent haha.  I've been here on several occasions and have tried many of their dishes! My favourites include the Curry Beef Udon and Herb Cream Noodles with Chicken. I would say the rice bowls area bit boring and you get tired of it after the first few bites. I've tried the Beef and Salmon rice and I would say it's a strong 3.5/10! The noodles are the best and awesome ahlie.   Don't be sus about this review or i'll dab on you.   Anyways sorry, i'm an angsty teen but I just wanted to say that the rice cakes are a must try!! But only as a group snack cause I got t for a meal and it was boring. I was sad cause my friend was slurping on her curry udon in front of me...  Okay i'm gonna skrt skrt outta here peace my dudes"}
{"text":"There is something so satisfying when the meal comes piping hot.  It is remarkable that despite the sizzle, the beef is tender and juicy with the curry sauce and the udon noodles are al dente.  Can't ask for a better choice of a meal tonight. Definitely one to come back for.  This could be my comfort food.  So take note though that the restaurant is small.  I came past 9pm and got myself a table.  There are only four.  If you have the time to wait, I recommend you try it"}
{"text":"A restaurant that specializes on \"Pepperlunch\" style sizzling plate fusion rice and noodle dishes.  They have buy one get one free on main dishes promotion going on. Quite busy on Saturday night but didn't take long for a table.  Black Curry Sizzling Poutine - 3.5/5 Literally just fries and shredded cheese smothered with Japanese curry sauce. Could have had some real meat or cheese curds on there. The sauce wasn't bubbling, but the fries were crispy and tasted good.  Spicy Mentaiko Beef Udon - 4.5/5 Quite delicious, the cream sauce tasted more like kimchi than mentaiko. There are a couple of rare beef slices with the udon that cooks with the heat of the sizzling plate. Could have used more seaweed and sesame on top.  Black Curry Pork Cutlet Sizzling Rice - 4/5 Came later than the other two dishes. I think the kitchen waits for a few orders of the same dish and puts them out at the same time. There's a good amount of pork cutlet and they're fried nicely. More meat than the beef supreme rice. The corn pieces on the rice balances out the curry sauce nicely.  A good place to try out if you haven't tried sizzling plate. IMO is the best restaurant in the plaza.  Cash or debit only (debit only above $20)"}
{"text":"Before you continue reading my comment. I would say \"this place is SHIT\". First of all, one of the waitress attitude was so bad. I believe her name starts with a K, since we heard it from her coworker. We went to this restaurant on a weekday afternoon and we were the only customers there.   But the food took 45 minutes to serve. When we asked the waitress about it, she gave us the dirtiest look and told us to keep waiting.   We order the seaweed fries and it was bad. We didn't even taste any seaweed favour. The rice was also shit with almost no sauce at all. So the whole thing was so dry.   They really need to improve their customer service and food quality if they care about their business.   For me, I don't care how they improve it but I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Compared to Aka Teppan, they have a much larger selection of food now.  The tables and everything is exactly the same as Aka Teppan was before. One thing about their booth seats is that they are SO extremely close to the table. I couldn't imagine someone larger than me trying to sit in one of these booths. Thats something they should really change. I didn't get a chance to try any of their main dishes, but I tried their Bite Size Tofu and Rice Rolls.  The Bite Size Tofu was good. The outer layer of it tasted similar to fries, except theres tofu inside. It comes with some sort of dipping sauce, but for someone who cannot handle spice, it was waaaay to spicy for me. As for the Rice Rolls, there isn't much to say. It tasted just like any other place.  Next time i'm here, i'd definitely want to give their drinks and desserts a try."}
{"text":"Really should be 2 stars for their average quality of food but an extra star is for their expanded menu (from the previous Aka Teppan menu) which now includes more appetizers and desserts.    Their entrees (sizzling plate/hotpot) are priced like Aka Teppan, and is a bit expensive for what you get.  If you have a healthy appetite, there is not enough meat for a $13 pan of rice, and only a few slices of meat for their $17 hotpot.  Both quality and quantity are below average, but they also offer sizzling rice cake and shake fries.  Shake fries are fries they put in a paper bag and you can season the fries with your choice of seasoning (seaweed, wasabi, spicy).  It's fun to try once but I may not buy a $4.99 season-your-own fries experience again.  Also, I'm not sure about their other seasoning choices, but no matter how much seaweed powder i put in, the fries do not taste like seaweed.  Our paper bag also ended up ripping from all the oil.    Overall, Flaming Kitchen offers an expanded menu from the predecessor Aka Teppan.  The decor looks very unfinished still as the walls are still bare - this may change in the future as they are newly opened."}
{"text":"Came here the first time tonight to try out the food. Ordered the lamb rice, the portion is pretty small $10.99 you get 8 little pieces of lamb meat and jalapeños around the side and overall I find it very greasy. The customer service was great though but just not the place I would want to come again."}
{"text":"Flaming Kitchen - visited ; December 21, 2017  My wife and I decided to stop in cause we were curious.  In the end this resto went over our usual budget for a \"cheap eats\" place to eat.  The bill with taxes ran us close to $50.00 with taxes in, our usual budget is around $15.00 - $30.00 taxes in.  So this place for single person eating would be considered $$ under Yelp price  rating.  For couples I'd say this is falls under $$ ($30.01 - $50.00)  Service was ok for the most part, I'ld rate this as 3/5.    Food : We ordered the popcorn chicken ($6.99), I ordered the sizzling pork with black curry sauce ($12.99) & my wifey opted for a seafood noodle soup ($13.99) + an Oreo Matcha smoothie ($6.99).  Price point aside, we enjoyed our dishes.  The Oreo Matcha smoothie was also delicious.    Food value : the quantity of popcorn chicken for the price paid was kinda small so value of the popcorn chicken I'd rate 3/5.  for the value of the sizzling pork with the black curry sauce I'd rate 3/5 the portion was also small for the amount paid, I'd personally value this dish as a $8.99-$9.99 dish.  As for the seafood noodle soup I'd rate a 4/5  for value of portion to dollars paid.  My wife had a hard time finishing it, however for $14.00 this is a bit steep, this I'd price around $9.99 or $12.00.  Method of payment : Cash and Debit available, uncertain on Credit Card at time of this writing."}
{"text":"The food there was good but the servers seemed really rude and were unable to separate the bill since I went with my friend. Plus, their promo only works when everything's paid in cash which made me a little upset. And on top of that, they kept asking for tips which I felt that it was desperate of them to do."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.. I ordered their mango parfait and it was literally just plain granola, overly-artificially sweet mango ice cream, whip cream and some cereal with a random ice cream cone on top. Unimpressed. I can literally make that at home and probably using better and more unique ingredients. Their beef sizzling plates had very little portion of low-quality beef. Service was bad - servers are slow and rude. I would not come back. The only thing decent was the blandly flavoured (seaweed) shakeshake fries which was only good because the fries were from Costco and who doesn't love Costco fries?! It would have probably tasted better without the seaweed seasoning. Overpriced and low quality."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here and we left full and satisfied! We both ordered udon dishes ($0.49 extra), as well as a side of popcorn chicken to share. The portions are quite filling, and the taste is amazing. The prices were pretty worth, being just over $10 a plate, not including extra toppings.  In terms of payment, you can use a debit card if your order totals to over $25. However, I didn't know that they accepted SPC (perks of being a broke college student), with 10% off BUT only if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"The one thing I like about this place is there house teppanyaki sauce. It basically gives all the rice dishes their flavor.  The Beef and salmon rice dishes are much better than the Udon noodle dishes. Especially when you add corn, green onion, and mushrooms. The extra topping are at a premium though. The mushrooms are overly priced at $1.49 for a little less than a cup. The Beef and salmon come out raw so you have to flip it before your plate gets too cold. The edamame is too saucy to be any good but the fried cheese balls are delicious!  Menus are a little lengthy to read through  My recommendation for first timers : Beef and salmon with rice with house teppanyaki sauce and corn and green onion"}
{"text":"Location/Service Right inside First Markham Place (Rodick and Highway 7). Plenty of parking available, but it does get pretty intense during rush hour.   The restaurant is the same location what Aka Teppan used to be. A little small, not too ideal for big groups of people. They renovated inside to have more of a simplistic white elegant look.   Staff were friendly and food was provided pretty quickly. Compared to before, there is a wider range of menu items and prices seemed to have increased a little.   Food  Still sticking with the original concept, they specialize in sizzling hot plate dishes. I tried the black curry pork katsu plate with an added egg.  The plate is super hot so be careful when mixing the food together. The curry sauce I had was a little thick, but the pork katsu was good - not overly hard and adding it with the rice gives a comforting feel to it.   Overall, I don't see a huge improvement from before. It is a nice place for a quick grab, especially during lunch. I would come back again to try their other menu items and see how it differs."}
{"text":"This place used to be called AKA teppan. Most famous for their sizzling plates. The menu has changed after the renovation. Prices are around $10-15 for a rice or noodle sizzling plate. The sauce is inside the rice tower and the salmon and beef are only half cooked, the rest cooks with the hot plate. Pretty cool concept."}
{"text":"Rating - 3.0/5.0  This place opened just recently at First Markham Place. Currently in their soft opening phase, replacing Aka Teppan with essentially the same menu along with some additional items introduced.   Spicy Mentaiko Beef Udon ($12.99) - The udon texture was done perfectly with the right amount of cheesy sauce and a bit of spice. However for the price, there was not much meat and the meat quality itself was lacking in my opinion. If you are a meat eater like myself, this may not fully satisfy you. But definitely give it a try if you love melted cheese and chewy udon.  Tom Yum Shrimp ($7.99) - These shrimps were lightly crisp and were really plump in texture. The tom yum sauce was flavourful but there was just too much of it. Although the shrimp still remained crispy for the most part, it would have been much better if they had the sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Came here after First markham place, and decided to give this place a try. The waiters were nice and helpful in recommending dishes, but the service of the food was quite slow considering how empty it was. By the time my partner got his dish i was already almost finished mine. So he was basically  sitting there staring while i was eating.   The food was good, got the beef rice with herb cream and it was different and tasty. My partner ordered the herb cream spaghetti and it was very dry and needed more sauce. We also ordered a rice cake dish which was better than other places. The seats were quite comfortable and place seems very clean.  yeah  I wonder how long my food would take to come out if it was very busy but would recommend this place if you don't mind waiting for long periods of time. before your food comes out. Might be back to try the dessert as well."}
{"text":"Greatest service my friend and I have ever experienced. My friend and i decided to try out this place on a Friday night at 9:30pm (so it wasn't busy) and from the second we stepped in we were warmly greeted and immediately seated. Our waiter was great! She pays attention to you closely and promptly refills your water before you even realize you need it. Besides that, the food was great! Good price too, with portions that was just right for my friend and I. I highly recommend this dish my friend got - it was udon with creamy mushroom sauce and truffle on it... I don't remember the dish name but it was delicious! If i weren't lactose intolerant I would've gotten it for myself hehe.  At the end of the day, my friend and I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Food is a little pricey for the portion that you get. No debit card allowed, credit card if you spend more than $25 I believe. It's a like cramped inside as well, I'm sure other locations may do better justice."}
{"text":"My friend and I originally came here because we saw a free appetizer thing on Instagram. We didn't know what to get but while waiting for a seat we saw a guy trying it out smiling saying it's \"very cheesy\" so we got the cheesy rice cakes (a bit spicy) and it was really cheesy and chewy. There are mushrooms hidden in the dish too stab ur fork onto the plate. Also I burned my tongue from eating a chicken on my Tom Yum Chicken dish. The waiters watched us eat the rice and then came up and told us to crush and mix everything together (also it was kinda salty but I didn't mind) (me and my friend are talking rn and we want to go back because we are hungry) (ps alex hi)"}
{"text":"This was a VERY SMALL restaurant. I think it's more for take-out. There was probably 2 tables and a bar table. Luckily, we got here and the restaurant was empty so we were able to get a nice seat. The server was attentive at first, but we then found it a bit hard to get their attention as we were sitting behind a wall. We ordered the takoyaki, popcorn chicken on rice, and the black curry pork cutlet on rice. Decent flavours and portions. I do like the different options on their menu, it's different from other restaurants."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant on a Thursday afternoon thinking my girlfriend and I would be able to get our food and leave quickly, since we were in a rush. We both order two dishes plus the shake fries as an appetizer.   30 minutes go by and nothing comes yet, we ask the one waiter serving the whole restaurant if we could get a check up on our order and if it was possible to get our fries first because that realistically wouldn't take long to make. The waitress brushes us off and goes to another table and has us wait for another 5 minutes. She then goes to the kitchen to check and tells us it'll be another 10 minutes of a wait for our fries.   Completely ridiculous. Terrible service and the waitress wasn't even apologetic to us at all. IT amazes me how french fries could take 45 minutes to prepare. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Simple restaurant specializing in sizzling plates. The menu does feature a variety of different sizzling plates with seafood, pork, lamb, beef, accompanied with noodles or rice. There is also the option to build your own plate; choosing the sauce, protein, and carbs on your own. I would personally recommend the salmon or beef selections, which are decent cuts of meat and cook relatively quick on the plates. Accompanied by rice is best, to absorb the grease that is expelled from the cooking meats. On occasion, certain elements of the dish, such as a curry sauce may come overly cold and will not be warm enough through the plate; similarly to microwaving food, and the heat not being distributed evenly. Interesting take on sizzling plates, with quality ingredients and a large variety to choose from!"}
{"text":"I used to come here even when it was called Aka Teppan, but after it became Flaming Kitchen, I swear it got even better! The food is definitely more high quality now and the selections are very wide, including a make your own plate type of menu. I almost always religiously get the Tom Yum Chicken Rice, but I've tried the dishes that my friends get when I come with them and they are almost just as good. (JK- they're definitely just as good, but I can't seem to get enough of the Tom Yum Chicken Rice) Service is alright here, the servers are friendly but food can come out a little slow. Keep in mind they don't take debit unless you spend more than $25, and they don't take credit at all. Other than that, every experience here has been wonderful and it is definitely one of my favourite spots to come with friends!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner tonight, craving the jumbo scallop spaghetti with black truffle sauce.  I tried it for the 1st time the week before and loved it! The taste of truffle was definitely present.  Mister ordered the curry pork cutlet on the sizzling plate and we ordered the tom yum chicken on sizzling plate as an extra.  You get a free appetizer for orders over $28. Last time we got the popcorn chicken. This time we ordered the shake shake fries with wasabi powder.   Honestly, I love the food. No complaints with the pricing and portions...but what really bothered me was the service we received tonight (or in this case, didn't receive).   We were not served any water until halfway through our meal and only because I asked for it.   The worst part was paying for the meal. We paid with the cash the moment the bill was placed on our table, but had to wait a good 20 mins (half empty restaurant) and had ask 2 different times for someone to check on getting back the change. Meanwhile 3 tables who had asked for their bill after us already got up and left.   I dunno....is the food really worth putting up with bad service?  So sad. I really liked their jumbo scallop black truffle spaghetti....but I don't think I'll be back a 3rd time."}
{"text":"I have been to this place since it was called Aka Teppan. It is a great place to eat if you are looking for some good food. The problem is that this place is really small. Usually, there is a wait.   In terms of the menu, this place has more items that Aka Teppan. The food is similar, but they also serve a couple of different things. For example, there is a wider range of appetizers, and desserts. I haven't tried the desserts, but the fries and most of the appetizers are great.   I wasn't a fan of their drinks. It just felt like soda water/sprite with some flavouring or food colouring. Nothing to write home about.   Service is very average. It can be really slow sometimes with all the people that are there. I find that a little bit strange with the size of the place.   Overall, I would go back. I still have to try the desserts there."}
{"text":"After Flaming Kitchen took over Aka Tenppan it has gotten much worse in comparison. Keeping the concept of Aka Tenppan where dishes are served on a sizzling plate their menu has expanded to include more desserts and drinks.   We came on a weekend for dinner and there wasn't too much of a wait. We ordered a few snacks to share including the deep fried squid balls and shake shake fries where you can choose 1 flavouring of your choice to sprinkle over your fries and shake well to evenly coat it.   For the main event, I ordered the Black Curry Pork Cutlet Udon Soup. I found the curry wasn't that flavourful and the cutlet got soggy in the soup when I got to it. My friends all got the other sizzling plates and the portions have gotten smaller since the change of management.   This place is good for the novelty but I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"3/5  Did not visit Aka Teppan (previous name), so wanted to try this place out. Came on a Saturday afternoon ~2 pm, and there were only two other tables. The menu has a mix of preset and custom built rice and noodle sizzling plates, in terms of entrees. Ordered the Mentaiko Spicy Udon (12.99) while others ordered the salmon steak rice set (13.99) and beef rice (9.99). Udon was quite tasty, with a cheesy spicy mix. Make sure you flip the meat right away or else it might get stuck to the plate. Wish the portion was a bit bigger for both udon and the beef, although both rice dishes looked to be decent.   Can't speak for the drinks and desserts, but not sure how they compare all the places nearby within FMP (such as Sugar Marmalade and Mabu) right next door. Couldn't really gauge the service attentiveness given the lack of customers at the time, but generally a decent experience."}
{"text":"I had Pepper Lunch 15 years or so ago in Japan I was instantly addicted to the hot plate beef & buttery rice combo.  I've been waiting for awhile for a replica or franchise in Toronto.  Finally AKA Teppan opened a few years back and we came often.  AKA Teppan closed and re-opened with a new expanded menu and rebranded as Flaming Kitchen.  This place is a copy of Pepper Lunch.  For those who haven't tried this before, meals are served on a HOT plate (200+ degress Celsius) - so DO NOT TOUCH!  They have a lot of menu items in their new menu, however I always go the Supreme Beef - it is too good to resist! Supreme Beef is their specialty and you won't get a screwed up order.  Basically, what you get is a bowl of rice with butter and special sauce goodness in the middle.  The rice is surrounded by rolls of beef (think of those rolls of beef that you get for Chinese hot pot).  It is up to you to unroll the beef, along with breaking up the rice and mixing the butter and sauce.  As you mix, the beef is cooked and the flavours are all mixed in.  We did also order the Seafood Pancake, Black Sesame Parfait and Mango Supreme.  Seafood Pancake is all dough, with maybe 2-3 pieces of squid - DO NOT order this!  Black Sesame Parfait is decent as well as the Mango Supreme.  I wouldn't come here just for the dessert, however their dessert is decent, actually better than other dessert only places in First Markham.  Note 1: I don't think their \"plate oven\" is very large.  If you have multiple party members, it is unlikely that you get your meal at the same time.  The orders will roll out as the plates are done, so you should start cooking your food once you get your plate, don't wait for the others in your group to get their food.  Note 2: I noticed a lot of reviews complained about the service - I agree, the waitresses here are a bit dense and don't seem to know much.  They weren't aware of the Yelp checkin offer for free pop either, but we were able to get it after they discussed with the manager."}
{"text":"Try the spicy cheesy rice cakes full of flavour and a great starter. The curry poutine was pretty good too, the cheese potatoes and curry flavour just works! The rest of the dishes seemed a bit bland to me. Really poor service too, we're not able to describe the dishes well."}
{"text":"Tasty food, prompt service! Was very pleased with the popcorn chicken, kit kat slush and supreme beef."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is food on a sizzling plate. There's so much stuff on the menu it's so hard to decide!! You can DIY your sizzling plate for those indecisive individuals.   We ordered the okonomiyaki fries ($6.99) on a sizzling plate which was yummy! Great flavours and crispy fries. Would get this again.   My boyfriend ordered the supreme beef rice plate ($9.99) with an egg which you crack on the plate for it to cook (+0.99). The plate has 8 thin slices of beef on the plate. The flavours are good, but it would be better with more protein.  I customized my plate with a smoked duck breast pasta in herb cream sauce for $11.49. I opted for udon instead of spaghetti (extra 49cents), added corn for 99cents and black truffle sauce for extra $3.49. Duck breast was OK, not much smoke flavour and probably won't be my pick the next time. Udon was chewy texture and the creamy sauce was yummy. Corn was a good touch, not sure if a handful of corn is worth 99cents though.   Lavender milk tea ($4.99) came in a nice blue colour in a tall glass. Sweet and subtly floral (not too overpowering).   This place is great to try, but it's more expensive than I'd like it to be. The food came out fast, decent portion sizes that leaves you content and excellent service (cleared the table quickly and refilled our water multiple times)."}
{"text":"We went around nighttime and I was surprised to find it not busy. Before this location opened, I would usually go to the one in Markham and there would be a long wait. I got the Tom Yum Chicken and Bite Sized Squid Balls. Couldn't really finish the dish because it was too spicy for my liking, but it was probably because I added the kimchi. Not a bad place to go to if you're hanging out with some friends in the area."}
{"text":"May be I went on one of their off nights, but my experience here was not good. Neither service or the food was worthy to return.   Seafood pancake was dry and burnt. And there was hardly any seafood in it  Hot water was lukewarm. Nothing can be worse then lukewarm water.   They gave us our ice cream dessert while we are still eating our dinner. (Our dessert had ice cream!!) talk about lack of common sense from the servers.   With so many restaurants in the area, it is hard for me to justify coming back if I didn't like anything the first time.   Let's see how long flaming kitchen's flame will last before burning out."}
{"text":"I have been here around several times so far and have enjoyed my experience each time!   I love the variety of menu items and option to customize my own sizzling plate. I have tried a variety of the noodle and rice dishes accompanied with the different toppings. They were all enjoyable and the best definition of comfort food. My favourites would have to be the spicy cheesy chicken ramen (a heavy dish), and the smoked duck breast herb cream spaghetti.   I wouldn't really recommend the black curry udon because although tasty, it's because they used costco fries and packaged curry mix which is alright but kind of lame for being around $7.   It doesn't just end at sizzling plates; they also have an assortment of asian desserts! The first time I went here was actually for just dessert as I wanted a change from Sugar Marmalade. The green tea molten lava cake is not too sweet and has that bitter matcha taste I prefer. The panna cotta is tasty as well but it's nothing too special. The rose milk tea is a nice, unique flavour and comes in a tall, fancy schmancy glass.   Overall, this is my go to for affordable meals. The service has been quite attentive every time I went, even when it was busy. Note: the dishes DO NOT arrive at the same time, but as expected from an asian establishment. However, I'd say to dig right in if your dish comes first because the sizzling and heat to cook your dish thoroughly doesn't last forever!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. Okonomiyaki fries was yummy since they used Costco fries - I love Costco fries. The Tom yum udon sounds like a weird mix but was surprisingly delicious. Somehow they made that combo work in a sizzling plate.  Prepared yourself for a very greasy meal."}
{"text":"I was really sceptical about coming here for dinner because of the mixed reviews about this place. Not sure if I caught them on a good day or they just improved from all the negative reviews.   The place is a lot more ventilated than Aka Teppan was which is great I don't feel so congested from the heat and smoke as I did from Aka Teppan. The food is pretty much the same, sizzling plates. They serve more stuff though, like hot pot, desserts and appetizers.  I ordered the Spicy Mentaiko Udon which was surprising really good and filling. It was full of cheese which is why it was so filling LOL. For dessert I got the black sesame dumpling, it was okay nothing really special. I do like how the dessert wasn't too overly sweet though. It felt weird how everyone's food didn't come out at the same time though. Like it was a good 5-10 minutes in-between each other...Which would be really awkward if you were to come with a big group.  The menu was overwhelming as well, poorly designed. There were a lot of options and if you didn't know how this place worked you would have a confusing time.    I would come back here but I wouldn't seek this place out on my own. If someone suggested I would not oppose but I would not suggest it myself."}
{"text":"Visited a couple times since they rebranded and was very pleased with their updates. Menu looks a lot bigger and food tasted amazing. Favourite dish is the flaming kitchen spicy noodle. Cheesy, chewy spicy noodles! I'm drooling just thinking about it~ Spicy rice cakes and shake shake fries (spicy flavoured) are really tasty too! Also tried the durian parfait and their homemade durian ice cream is delicious. Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"There has been quite a hype going around about this new location in Scarborough, so I was excited to try it! However, the quality of the food didn't live up to the hype. The presentation of the food was pleasing to the eye, but it wasn't as pleasing to my taste buds. It simply tasted like something that could be made at home. One thing I must say, the Green Tea Brownie dessert was exceptionally delicious and preferred that over my meal."}
{"text":"Came here on opening weekend when they had the BOGO deal on some main dishes. Arrived after the dinner rush so we were seated right away. Staff were always on the go, and we did have to waive them down to place our order and get refills on water. Wait time for food wasn't bad though. Hands down our favourite dish was the Flaming Chicken Spicy Noodle. Everything else we ordered was flavourful but if you are sensitive to spice, stay clear of the Korean Spicy Beef Rice. We also could've done without the Salmon Spaghetti with Cream Sauce (a little bland). Overall had a good experience, prices were reasonable, and food was good. FYI: the restaurant only took cash or debit (over $20)."}
{"text":"The hot plates are really cool and the display is great for those instagram and Snapchat pictures but I don't think the quality of food is worth the price."}
{"text":"Nice place for a casual outing. Serves hot food and desserts. The sizzling hot plates are delicious and you'll find a little surprise in the rice (seasoned butter)! I'm lactose so I was glad I quickly found it while it was still in solid form and gave it away. But it's a nice touch for those who like butter :)   Food value is pretty good and staff is nice and helpful. Will come back to try their fries!"}
{"text":"Totally over hyped, and not worth it. We waited 40 minutes to get a table Friday night. Their kitchen is super slow and it took around 30 min for the food to come out. They also got my friend's order wrong twice. The food was very average. They do have a extensive menu and lots of options."}
{"text":"Great place for fans of sizzling plates and cheesey entrees with corn. I had the Salmon Udon with Herb Cream, and loved it! The flaming crispy chicken is also a must try. I was lucky to get a free appetizer and had the okonoyomi fries... Delicious! The parfaits are beautiful, and the corn flakes add a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a Friday night, overall would probably not be back. I had tried the flaming chicken spicy noodle which was ramen with their signature spicy sauce with chicken and a slice of processed cheese. I mixed the cheese and drenched the chicken with the sauce. First bite, tasted much like plastic and the more I ate the more I couldn't continue. It is also very heavy. I would however recommend their chicken wings. I tired the salted shaddock which was quite flavourful. Sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"Came to flaming kitchen on a regular weekday night, and there were quite a number of people waiting to dine here!  Flaming kitchen took over the location of Aka Teppan, which essentially served the same type of food (sizzling hot plate). I wonder if there was a new owner who took over and just changed the name.   After ordering our food, we waited approximately 15 minutes to get our food - I guess we came at a good time because other reviews seem to write a much longer wait time. My friend tried the black curry pork katsu, while I had the beef supreme.  The sizzling hot plate definitely kept the food warm, and the paper on the side prevented the oil from hitting my hand. However, you have to take the paper out of the way to mix the food on the sizzling plate before it sticks to the bottom. The food was very flavourful, not too salty or too much sauce! Overall, I thought flaming kitchen was an average food location!"}
{"text":"this is similar to mabu which is a couple stores down  it comes in a sizzling plate which is cool I came twice and both times I got the curry udon beef noodle and its awesome !!! the thin beef slices are supper good my friend got the cheesy rice cakes and it's pretty good but you should share it or it gets boring  the rice is good too comes with some brown sauce but idk what it is  prices are average only small complaint I had would be to have more noodles because it's yummy and I want MORE"}
{"text":"Yet another GEM in Scarborough!!!!!!! We ordered some things to share but definitely my favourite was the Jumbo scallops with truffle cream sauce. And the shrimp that was on the appetizer list.   I love my food super hot so I really loved this place because most of the dishes are literally flaming. must try"}
{"text":"Food was average and pricey for what it is.   We started with popcorn chicken. There was only like 10 little pieces for $6.99! The worst part was that the chicken was very dry and flavourless. All I could taste was the oil and batter. Not worth your money at all!  For the main, we shared the Supreme Beef rice. It was exactly the same as Aka Teppan's. The sizzling plates really keeps your food warm until the last bite. The sauce was tasty, but they loaded the rice with so much... probably to try to cover up the lack of flavour from the beef itself. It's pretty much what you would expect it to be though.   We got there early on a weekend evening, and had planned on getting dessert after. The food came out quickly but then the place got busy and they seemed to want us to leave after eating our main. They cleared our table and never bothered refilling our water. We decided to skip it and went somewhere else instead.   They only accept debit over $25, which is very high considering a meal is about $12 on average. They didn't even tell us about the minimum when we asked. Only found out when we actually went to pay. Luckily we had just enough cash on us.   There are many other places in the area that have better food and service. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I came on a Monday night for dinner. It was about three quarters full, and we were seated and greeted fairly quickly.  We ordered two plates around 7:45 pm:  Tomato Seafood Udon and Spicy Beef Udon. came at just past 8:05, so expect around 20 minutes for the food.   The  beef looks like mac n cheese, but it's actually a creamy batter sauce. It tastes pretty good (and a hint of cheese... I wouldn't be surprised if they did have a bit). The beef was very tasty - good flavour and a spicy kick.  The seafood udon wasn't bad - two shrimp, naruto, and some corn and imitation crab meat.   Quality was solid, but portion size was underwhelming. They weren't worth $16 each (after tax and tip). Maybe we'll try again during a promotion or something!  Ambience is nice - bright and comfortable. It's a bit cool, but once you eat, you are glad for it. The temperature can be annoying while you wait for your food though!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place with a variety of items on their menu. Their specialty is sizzling plates, which can be for rice, noodles or desserts!   Mind you, I came here when I was hangry, so anything I ate was good. But this is a great place to be hangry if you want to indulge and stuff your face with deep fried and cheesy foods!  We got the cheese curds (which were so crispy and delicious!), rice rolls (I like a lot of sesame on mine and I found there weren't enough of it, it was a lot of sweet sauce), chicken noodles (which were spicy! and too greasy/salty for my liking) and because our order was like $28 or something, we got an additional free appetizer. We chose the shake shake fries, which between two people, came to a small handful each; nice and crispy and an interesting concept (you add seasoning to the fries in a paper bag and shake it to mix, then pour it out onto little bowls to eat).  I'd come again; nice presentation and the service is pretty accessible and friendly too."}
{"text":"You're not guaranteed to get food here. Even though it's a restaurant? Wild right?  Placed my order after waiting 15 min for a table - even getting a ticket with your number was a struggle. The servers would have a puzzled look on their face looking at the people at the door. The group that came in after us didn't get a number until 10 min later, even though they were standing there when I got mine.   Ordered 1 app, 2 entrees and 2 desserts. Waited 35 min. Nothing. Asked server when the appetizer would at least show up. She said 2 min. 10 min later, nothing. So we just stared at the kitchen staff, until one of the COOKS had to come out to ask us what was wrong/if we were waiting for anything.   I told him we were waiting for everything. He asked \"like what\". Excuse me? I. Am. Missing. My. Whole. Order. I was asked what was on my order so I called them out and asked if they lost our order. He said yea we lost it. WHAT DID THE WAITRESS CHECK EARLIER? 2 min for an order of nothing?!   We left. Wasted an hour. By the time we left, all the other good places were going to close soon.   Kbye. Never again."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is terrible... Even worse than the old Aka teppan place that I only tried once and never went back.   Everything is oily and the ingredients are all of extremely low quality. Bad ventilation so you end up smelling like meat after your meal. To top it off, the place isn't all that cheap for what you get. So many better places elsewhere, so not going back."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick dessert with the kids.  Parfaits and marshmallow waffles (eggos) were a big hit, but unfortunately the servers forgot our lava cake which made one child very unhappy (and ruined the visit a bit). Staff seemed inexperienced and aloof. (one star removed)   We came once before they rebranded, and enjoyed their sizzling beef plate.   The rest of their new menu looks very promising. Lots of interesting snack items. Will be back to check out the some more items and hopefully the servers will be more attentive."}
{"text":"Food was great. I loved my dish i felt that it was totally worth 12.99$ for that tomato seafood noodle.  We got a free appetizer for ordering $28 and more before tax. The shake shake fries was interesting. I wish the fries were fresher or the oil that they used were not that old. The colour on the fries weren't yellow it was brownish orange... to me it feels like it was double fried.  Each hot plate noodle was delicious they did not skimp out on any of the meat. There were shrimp, beef and chicken all around each hot plate.   The tomato seafood noodle looked amazing and I couldn't stop thinking it was such a great deal since the scallops were huge and there were 4 peeled shrimps. There were the right amount of noodles.   Finally we were so full that we were ready to leave and when we got the bill we were shocked why the seafood noodle on the bill was $14.99. We asked for the menu to double check if we misread but we didn't. We waved down the waitress and asked her about why there was price difference between the menu and our bill. She asked us if the waitress did not mention about the price difference at the beginning... when she was the one who took our order... the waitress asked us what she wanted them to do, remove it from our bill or what. I get the place is busy but if your menu is  telling your customer what they are charging would you assume that there are changes? I don't think so. The menus did not have a sticker telling you know the prices changed or anything. As we asked for the manager the  waitress took forever to come back then lastly she told us  \"oh we're so busy so we will honour our menu price and charge you $12.99 instead of $14.99. If the company is so lazy in charging their menu why did they bother changing the system. Did they really expect people to not check their bills! GREAT COMPANY TO STEAL FROM CUSTOMERS WALLET!"}
{"text":"Another girl + a few others had the same experience as me so clearly this place is SHIT. PLEASE DON'T GO HERE. No matter how much instagram foodies hype it (remember, all their posts are positive because they get their food FOR FREE).  I came here because I fell into that trap.  We were originally going to get dinner at one of our favourite spots and try out a new dessert spot that we've had on our list for awhile. Because of flaming kitchen, we didn't get ANY food AND missed our opportunity to go to the other dessert because they took so long.   We waited awhile to sit down which is fine. Then we ordered, used our Yelp check in deal for a free pop, which the server was condescending about and was like \"it's only one check in deal for one pop\" to which I responded \"only he is getting it...\". We ordered the food and decided to order dessert too instead of hitting up the other spot because they had a lot of good looking parfaits. We waited 40 FUCKING MINUTES to get nothing. They didn't even check on us. After 35 min, we asked for a status check on our APPETIZER- a mere small tofu dish. She came back and said 2 minutes.  The table beside us ordered 10 minutes later & got their full order way before us. I guess the kitchen staff saw me looking annoyed because he came out & asked if we are missing something. Well, CLEARLY if our table is empty. Then he came back and tried to play it off and ask what parts we were missing - and then we got him to admit that our whole order went missing?!!???? Then what the flying fuck was the other girl checking and telling us that it'd be ready in 2 minutes??????   When we were leaving, one of the servers stopped my bf not to say sorry but to say \"didn't you have a pop?\" and tried to charge him for the yelp check in deal.  I AM SO DONE.  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT support a place that is like this. If you're a long term follower of my reviews, you know I keep it 100% real all the time. So who will you believe? Your favourite foodies that sell themselves out for a free teppan dish? (again, I'm not personally hating on anyone specifically but IF THE SHOE FITS.) Or moi, who works @ yelp and still has no filter on delivering the truth.  Ps. if you are the owner and you see this, do not ask me to email you or offer to make it better for next time, I am not wasting my time and not interested in coming to flaming kitchen again, so don't waste yours."}
{"text":"Food was okay but service was incredibly subpar.  We ordered two plates with addon mushrooms and both plates arrived without the addons nor did anyone try to clarify anything until we brought it up with the server.  They also forgot about our drink order and did not start it until we finished our meal at which point they informed us that they would not be able to make one of them. We asked them to just remove it from the bill and not make the latter drink. The peach mango tea with tapioca we ordered arrived predictably without tapioca. At this point we didn't even bother bringing it up with the wait staff.  Food was okay. But for the price of having to add small ingredients on for $2 or $3 here, you're better off going somewhere else for your meal.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a chilly day. Was quite busy when we arrived on a Friday evening for dinner. It's a fairly new place but they have various restaurants in the GTA. It was quite busy and it was packed when we arrived around 8. It's not a big place either so there's not many tables. They serve quite a unique selection of appetizers, sizzling Chinese dishes and desserts. It's quite hard to choose from the menu as there are so many good things to choose from. I ordered the black curry cutlet with rice. It took a bit longer to get our food but we finally got it. The rice and corn was just alright. The pork cutlet was crispy and delicious. Sauce was alright. Overall, a little bit pricey than I would expect but not a bad place to dine at. I would be happy to come back and try their other dishes along with their interesting looking drinks and desserts!"}
{"text":"This is my regular spot because the food is always top notch and makes me feel warm inside. I call it my home away from home because it's so good. Today I tried something new here and it was delicious!!! I ordered the poutine!!! It was so good and so tasty!!! I highly recommend it!!! Once your done your apps I suggest you get my favorite thing on the menu... The supreme beef!!!!!! This is my go-to dish as it is always a knock out and so good!!! Today I got it with extra beef and garlic bits!! I ate the whole thing and was so happy. I will be back again as this is my favorite place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Before coming to Flaming Kitchen, I've read reviews below stating that the service was subpar which made me a little hesitant. However, my friend had nothing but praise so I decided to check it out - and I'm glad I did! Both times I've been here, the service is decent (what you would expect in FMP) but the food is always yum! I personally love the spicy duck udon and the tom yun chicken rice (pictured below) so if you're stopping by, be sure to check that out!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. Waited at least 25 minutes after ordering for food to arrive, and my plate was cold without the curry sauce, despite ordering the curry pork rice plate. Takes forever to get the bill and to get any service here. Save your money and don't come to this location. I am absolutely appalled..."}
{"text":"Came in for a lunch date with my boyfriend and ordered the spicy mentaiko beef udon and salted squid balls. They blew my mind!! We were not expecting those flavours at all. The squid balls were perfectly salted with a crispy outside and chewy inside. The udon though was amazingly delicious! It was cheesy with the perfect amount of spice and it paired perfectly with the chewy texture of the udon noodles. Only gave 4 stars though because the meat was slightly over done for my taste just because they were on the sizzling plate for so long,but my boyfriend thought they were cooked perfectly, and they only take cash despite having a debit machine. I would definitely come back and try the rest of the menu and the desserts!"}
{"text":"I actually liked aka teppan before and I don't think the food now is any different than before. Flavours and quality of food are still there. I think they did add some new stuff to their menu and the new selection is pretty good. We had their supreme beef,metaiko spicy udon noodle and black curry poutine. All were pretty savoury so I have no complaints there. As usual their portions will not fill you up but their prices are pretty decent. Their appetizers has never let me down as the ones I've eaten were all yummy :)"}
{"text":"Ordered thesalmon shrimp teppan rice $11.99 with $0.99 cabbage add on. Sauce was slightly too salty,butter was a nice touch but could've been placed on the seafood instead.Shrimp and salmon were decent quality"}
{"text":"????OK???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????cute,????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Flaming kitchen definitely has those flames going in the kitchen and I will vouch after eating at this restaurant twice that you do leave with the smoky and oily aroma in your hair and in your clothes. Depending on what you're doing for the rest of the day, you may or may not want to smell like smoke and oil.  Regardless, the food is quite delicious. I absolutely enjoyed how the restaurant does not skimp out on the quality of the food in the main dishes--whether meat or seafood--and even though the cost of the dish is slightly on the pricier side, I would say it is worth it! In fact, the portion was so huge and filling, I had to pack half of it home. In addition, I loved the sizzling hot plates kept the food hot because I take a while to eat, so my food usually gets cold by the time I finish eating it--but not here! I found the udon a bit on the al dente side and it could have been more soft.   With the appetizers, the rice noodle roll lacked a depth of flavour that could be achieved with some soy sauce for contrast to the hoisin and peanut sauce. The shake shake fries was pretty cool, where you shake the amount of seasoning you'd like on your fries. However, the salad that I got was a disappointment, in the menu picture, it had giant pieces of salmon but in the actual dish, the salmon pieces were super thin--will definitely not order it again.  Service wise, the servers were fairly kind and attentive to your needs. I just question their hygiene as I saw a server touching food with her bare hands, serving other customers, taking the bills, and touching food again.  Overall, would I come back? Well, I already did because I enjoyed the experience very much but maybe just for dinner as I don't want to smell like smoke and oil for the rest of the day if I come here for lunch. I also want to try the desserts here as I haven't done it yet!"}
{"text":"Came here with a crew to check this new, renovated Flaming Kitchen.   From what I gathered this place went through some changes and they've increased the amount of desserts they now serve. Known for its sizzling plates with caution tape (paper) reminding patrons to not get burned lol. Their menu is extensive so do take your time ordering.  Their prices are reasonable as well. Ambiance-wise the place is clean and modern with plenty of seating available.   **Korean Fried chicken: served in a small basket, what can I say, you can't really mess up this dish.   **Squid balls; served in small basket, this was pretty good, portions were good, just wish this came with a dipping sauce.   **Spicy beef G2; Served on a sizzling plate with noodles surrounded by red beef in a flavorful spicy sauce that unified the dish! Delicious all the way.   **Green Tea Parfait; easy 5/5, Green tea ice cream served on a cone, resting on a bed of Green tea ice cream layered with red bean and some crunch on the bottom it was quite an overwhelming and filling dessert. This was impressive."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with my family.  All in all it was not bad.  Everything was very tasty.  The menu was a little overwhelming but we got through it.  There is a wide assortment of rice, noodles, desserts and drinks.  The dessert looked very good but we were too full to have.  We had the Spicy Korean Beef Rice, Brown Sugar Chicken Wings, Shaker Fries, Tom Yum chicken Rice and Ox Tongue with black pepper sauce with Udon.  The staff was really nice.  The place was pretty spacious and we did not have to wait at all for a table for 6.  I would definitely recommend this place but it would probably not be a regular place that we go to eat."}
{"text":"Price vs food not worth the price. Can on Friday night we ordered popcorn chicken, fried cheese,fries,choc lava cake & tong yuan soup. Bill came to $50. The chicken was over done and service was very slow."}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the menu!! The first time my friends and I came here I think we spent a good 10 minutes just staring at the menu because there was so much to choose from. When in doubt just look at the pictures and don't be afraid to try something new!   I personally recommend the flaming chicken spicy noodle, or the tom yum chicken rice. These are my usual dishes and they taste amazing. The dish tastes salty and savoury and honestly the rice really pairs well with the sauce. I also recommend the popcorn chicken as an appetizer.   The food is really filling, and super satisfying when you're craving something heavy."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars rounded up.  I came here for the first time last night with a friend who loves this place. I've always wanted to try it, and I was not disappointed.  We were seated quickly - the restaurant is on the smaller side, and it can get busy with more people. It was still not full around 7pm, though. The decor is minimalistic but classy, with pictures of menu items on the walls.  I ordered the Supreme Beef Rice for $9.99 based on my friend's recommendation. Our food came fairly quickly. You must mix the rice and beef in order to cook the beef, and the hot plate was just hot enough that it cooked my beef (although some parts remained a bit pink). Other reviews have stated that the plate remains hot for too long, but I didn't find that a problem. The food was quite tasty, although it wasn't as flavourful as I expected. The beef was a bit plain, as it was mostly the rice that was saucy. It has a strong peppery taste, and I just wish it was a bit more saucy for the beef. The portion size was quite big for the price, and it filled me up easily.  Overall, I enjoyed the meal and would come back to try their poutine or desserts! I did not know that this place only took cash or debit over $25. The restaurant should make that more clear."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday around 6:30pm for some delicious hot plate food! I ordered the Chicken Fillet on rice with Black Pepper sauce. The hot grilled plate came out within 15-20 minutes. The food was good! They have a paper warning, on how hot the plate is. So please watch those fingers and hands! The portions were enough for me, they also have appetizers where you could add more food.  I give 4 flaming plates out of 5 flaming plates.  Ohhh and if you're not a fan of black pepper, please ask the wait staff to lessen the black pepper flakes. The plates have a lot of black pepper on them.  I did find the chicken to be a little salty, that's where they lost a flaming plate rating from me. Overall, good. I'd go back in the future!"}
{"text":"The food can easily be made at home but it's still very delicious! I got it at half price during their promo and feel as if full price isn't worth it."}
{"text":"The curry pork cutlet was ok, not enough sauce. The desert my gf had was horrible... the browny was really small, with hot matcha where i can hardly taste any matcha. and it was 8.99..."}
{"text":"2.5/5   I tried this place yesterday.  The food wasn't bad,  but definitely has room for improvement    For appetizer, I got the preserved tofu with century egg.  Tofu was firm and fresh, but I feel Like I only got 1/4 of egg. Wayyy too much sauce to the point I can't even taste the egg either   Spicy noodle chicken- again, it was too saucy, too salty and too cheesy.  The spiciness was at a good level tho.   Mix and match duck breast and rice on sizzling plate- such little amount of meat.... only a few tiny pieces for an entree is ridiculous. ( I will attach pics) the rice really weirded me out too.  I was eating when I saw a yellowish colour ball in the centre of my rice.  My first instinct was that it was an egg yolk which I thought was pretty cool.  I bit into it and realized it was a ball of cold hard butter!!  I guess I was supposed to mix the rice and the butter was supposed to melt before I ate it. But I wasn't informed of that by anyone.   For dessert, I got the durian spring roll. It tasted very good, but the wait was a bit long. Around 15 min for 5 mini durian spring rolls"}
{"text":"4 stars for food 2 stars for everything else.  Firstly, we ordered several of their signature Beef Mentaiko udon and Beef Curry udon which were very delicious, saucy and udon was very smooth yet chewy. The beef rice on the iron skillet was good as expected, not overly saucy or lacked taste. We also ordered a Mixed Berry slush which was one of the best. Cold, refreshing, large and some seeds to chew on.  If I could rate everything else, 2 stars would be appropriate. Food took quite a while and the restaurant was understaffed. Orders were forgotten or hard to reach a waiter.  Would love to come back only if everything else improves."}
{"text":"My parents are never one to complain, but their experience at this restaurant was so negative that they asked me to post this review on their behalf since they don't have Yelp accounts. The abridged version: My parents arrived around 8:30pm and left at 10:30pm last night having not received any of the food they ordered despite asking three times about the status of their order.  Last night, they waited about half an hour to be seated and over an hour for their food, which they never received. They noticed 2-3 tables who were seated and ordered after them receive their food. Finally, after ONE HOUR at least, they asked their server about the food and the server apologized and informed them that the \"kitchen was experiencing problems\". They questioned the server about why tables who were seated and ordered after them had received their food already and were given the same excuse about kitchen issues. They ordered meals off the menu with no special exceptions or anything complicated. My parents asked the servers THREE TIMES about their order and each time, they were told that the server would check. All three times, no one returned to inform them of the status. My parents arrived around 8:30pm and finally left at 10:30pm hungry and upset without having been served any food. Our family eats out very often and this is by far one of the most unprofessional and disappointing experiences they've ever had. They spoke to some diners beside them who were also unhappy about their experience with the wait times and even cancelled their dessert order."}
{"text":"I go to the one at First Markham place all the time. When I went to the Scarborough one they had been opened for over a week. The food tasted the same as the Markham location. It looks and feels more spacious then the other one. The only difference - which I hope changes/improves, is the service. It's a bit slower and i'm not referring to the wait staff. The food seems to take a bit longer to cook. I will return if i'm in the area, really hoping they pick up the pace like the Markham location. Room for improvement, but the potential is there. And of course, i'll update my review when I return."}
{"text":"Jan/3/2018... the service was fast.. A bit chilly in there (but it was okay).. I ordered the \"Tom Yum Chicken\"  - I really liked it! Also I ordered the \"Deep Fried Tofu bites\"  - I liked it also!  My cousin ordered the \"Lamb Hotpot\" - she liked it (only thing is she ordered rice on the side cause we thought you had to buy the noodles or rice for the dish on the side) but the hotpot comes with noodles ...  my other cousin ordered the \"Kitkat slush\" we all tried some of it -we liked it. She ordered the \"tofu steak rice set\" it was nice, but she said too spicy  for her. I thought it was good! She also ordered the \"bite size cheese\" - we all loved it!!  I would go there again  (I will try the desserts next time)."}
{"text":"Sorry, I didn't get it. Flaming Kitchen shows up on a lot of Instagram feeds and even on friends' Facebook pages so it became a place that I had to try. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Maybe my dining companion and I just missed the point.  We started with Black Curry Poutine, one of the dishes featured in their menu. What we got was nothing like the picture that we just saw in the menu. First of all, isn't the cast iron plate supposed to be hot? Aren't fries supposed to be hot? Nothing was hot enough to melt the cheese. The curry flavour was very mild, hardly detectable. This dish was not a good value at 7.99.  My companion ordered a spicy beef udon noodle dish with mushrooms and zucchini added on. Her dish arrived swimming in a cheese sauce (not mentioned in the menu). It was more like a runny mac 'n' cheese.  I ordered a beef dish with rice and added on smoked duck breast (3.49) and mushrooms (1.49). It did arrive sizzling hot and still cooking. It required a quick stir to prevent burning. Flavourwise, it was okay but not great.  Overall, none of our dishes looked anything like the pictures in the menu. The beef dish was better than the noodles and the poutine, this version, should just be removed from the menu. I don't know what all the social media fuss is about. Did I miss something?"}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment. I ordered the Sizzling Green Tea Brownie with Tofu Pudding and Red Bean. The brownie was amazing but a lot smaller than I expected. There was too much red bean in my opinion and the tofu pudding was just bad. I went with two friends and one ordered a Chocolate Parfait-I dont know what we expected but it was all grocery store items. Frosted flakes, whipped cream, granola, a regular waffle cone, and to top it off chocolate ice cream with freezer burn. The other ordered the sizzling waffle plate that comes with a scoop of ice cream and marshmallows... and the waffle was an Eggo waffle! Not even freshly made, which their neighbours (Boba Boy, not a full-blown restaurant like they are) even offer. And don't think this is speculation. My friend asked our server at the end of the meal if the waffle was an Eggo waffle and she admitted it was. And to go off that, the service wasn't very helpful at all. We asked about several menu items because in the menu there are pictures but no explanations as to what exactly is in the dish, and both servers working at the time seemed to not know the menu well. They often responded with \"I'm not sure\" or even straight up \"I don't know\". It got so flustering that we stopped asking questions and just ordered something. I was already agitated and the fact that one server was literally dropping the dirty plates into a bin that was outside of the kitchen area--right behind us in the dining area--and making an absolute ruckus throughout the duration of our meal, made it worse. The only reason I've given more than one star is because the green tea brownie (not the whole dish, just the brownie) was actually tasty. I do want to try their entrées and appetizers... hopefully I'll have a better experience when I decide to come back."}
{"text":"I really like this remake. I tried their hot Plate rice, hot pot, and dessert.  Out of the 3 I'm a bigger fan of their desserts (hot Plate Brownie was amazing !!!)  You choose what you want and write it on the paper to give to the server. Speed differs- I've had mix experience before. Space is limited.   Not a place I would recommend for chilling and gatherings as they expect high turnovers for table, better suited for a quick dinner and lunch"}
{"text":"Amazing food if you love spicy or greasy food. They have from apps to drinks to desserts. You'll sit down and have at least one item you want from each page of the menu. Great cost for huge portions."}
{"text":"I had always thought the concept was a gimmick but today I dropped by for the BOGO50% promo (ended today). I have to say I was pleasantly impressed! I got the supreme beef rice ($10.99) and the plate was sizzling when it got here! I tossed the rice (sauce and butter is inside for flavour) with the beef together - yes its a gimmick as I thought but it tasted pretty good! The dish is a bit oily because the sizzling plate is coated in oil to prevent sticking. I also tried the katsu curry and that one is not as good.   The seating at this location is kind of tight - there are 6 table seats in front, 4 (but more like 3 if you don't want to be squished) counter seats and I think two tables of 2 in the back which wasnt open. The ventilation at these small stores in these buildings have always been an issue in my experience - be prepared to get a bit warm. This is not a good spot for a big group, but they have better locations for that!"}
{"text":"The wait time for food here is agonizingly slow. I've come twice and both times have had to wait over 20 mins for my food to arrive.  The food itself isn't bad but the wait time is what makes me hesitate coming often."}
{"text":"I got the Spicy Mentaiko Beef Udon and I was not disappointed. It was flavourful, saucy, and the udon was chewy and bouncy in texture. It's a little pricey for its portion size but overall I would come back again.   PS. They only take debit for $25+ so remember to bring some cash just in case! They do offer an ATM machine inside the restaurant though if you ever forget."}
{"text":"This is mainly to express my experience about the speed of their service. Took 30min to be seated and then another 45-1hour for 1 dish to come as of this moment I am still waiting for another dish. The tum yum chicken rice came first and it tastes quite nice but this will not make up for a hangry customer waiting for their food.  Update 2* Originally gave them 3 star, now became one for the following reasons. After another 20min has gone by when my spicy noodle finally arrived, I figured we will probably run into the same ordeal and I was right about that. I asked for my desserts to be served right away. Took me 20min to finish my food and still not here. Waited another 10min, 1 dessert came. Decided to cancel the other one and all of a sudden 1 min later they already made and forced it upon us. Funny enough they will make your food faster if you threaten to cancel the order. Btw, it was only a scoop of ice cream and a premade lava cake which took 30min to serve. In conclusion, don't come here unless you have a lot of time to waste.  There was a couple who sat down beside me that waited as long as me. Funny enough the owner/manager ish sat down at a table with his friend got served before that couple did after waiting for close to 40min as well."}
{"text":"I would probably give it a 1.5, but it's reduced to 1 instead of 2 stars because it is worse than better. I have given this place more than one chance to live up to the expectation and unfortunately it kept disappointing.  On the first visit, I ordered one of the steak hot plate dishes, since it's hard to mess up steak right? I was wrong. I wasn't expecting a beautifully cooked piece of steak, but for the price I didn't think it was worth it. The steak was not well cooked (and no, I do not mean it being well done) but the fat pieces on the steak were literally RAW, making a big piece of it inedible. The vegetables that accompanied it were not very impressive either. The corn is frozen and the cabbage bland. The original item I wanted was the hamburger, but they didn't have anymore (and this was around 2:00 in the afternoon).  So on the second visit, I figured I'd give them a chance for redemption. I got to order the hamburger sizzling plate and sadly, it was once again a disappointment. As a point of comparison, I've had hamburger steak at a different place and this place pales in comparison. But once again the blandness of the vegetables was consistent. I also ordered a mango and black jelly in coconut milk dessert. Let me tell you, do not expect to get what you see in the pictures, because when they note that it is only a reference, they really do mean it. It was a small bowl of coconut milk with a few slices of black jelly and the tiniest pieces of mango. The mango was cut so small you would think it was the frozen corn, and to make matters worse, the mango was already turning colours as the usual vibrant yellow was turning brown.  The only thing that has been decent there were the noodles with cheese and the takoyaki fries. Also on my first visit, they completely forgot about one of my friend's orders and we were only four people, so not a huge group for you to forget one of our meals. At least on the last visit, they were okay with switching the mango for red bean.   Overall, a disappointing experience. I find it to be just a gimmick and there are other places out there with sizzling plate dishes that are far superior. I won't say don't give it a try, but don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"MEH..  You'd think based on the name that the dishes would come out piping sizzling hot - be warned, there is none of that. There's nothing much to say about this place as the food tasted quite average (perhaps even a little below taking into account the price paid), with very average service and average decor. Wouldn't be upset about coming back but would rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I tried this place when it had just recently arrived in the plaza, as everyone was going there. From the pictures, Smokey look & all of the people I saw go I thought the food would be good. It wasn't.   I ordered rice w/ salmon, I don't recall what the actual name of the dish was. You have the option of choosing some of the already designated dishes with all of the ingredients chosen, or creating your own plate. I opted for one of the predesignated salmon dishes & added an egg (which was extra because it's an additional topping).  The food came out smoking & it looked appetizing at first. I put in the egg & it wouldn't even cook..... I thought that was the point of having the smokey plate but I guess not. This made my rice mushy & unappetizing. The sauce not the salmon could save it, mind you it wouldn't have been a great dish with or without the egg. It was a large waste of $13.   Now my reason for giving it even 2 stars is the servers really cared about your experience. I didn't end up finishing my meal or even half of it & they asked me what had gone wrong, etc. Very nice of them to take customer concerns into consideration."}
{"text":"Wow what a roller coaster of emotion coming here.   The store had 4 tables which means its gonna be cramped. The waitress didn't get up to greet us and I had to get the menu myself. The wait for the food was more than 40 minutes....  But by the time the food finally came, the waitress was sincere with her apology for the long delay and the food was incredible! I haven't had a good hot plate since HK and I found many of the places here seemed to skimp out on the ingredients or had poor / lacking flavour.  The popcorn chicken plate came with some corn and egg in the middle with a light and sweet soy sauce which tasted great after having it crispy on the edges from the heat. I also had the spicy creamy udon plate as well. Both had strong flavour and mixing the rice with the udon sauce taste great too.  Will be back again.... Hopefully it will be more speedy tho"}
{"text":"With the change in name also came with a variety of food and drinks including desserts! I usually get the Salmon with rice but now they include shrimp with the salmon which is a better bang for your buck! Their mango slush and kit-kat slush taste great! Can't wait to come back and try out more sizzling food items!"}
{"text":"I tried this type of cusine a long time ago at first Markham place and found it mediocre. I finally gave in to trying it again after walking pass this restaurant on Yonge. This is the first time I've tried the rebranded sizzling plate restaurant and I have to say I'm impressed! I ordered the katsu Curry- please skip this. Instead, go with the original beef. The beef is a bit dry but overall it is quite flavorful. Yummm! The place is small and you'll need to find your own parking. But since I can walk to here from my condo, this is perfect for a table for one situation!"}
{"text":"This new cozy little spot is quite awesome. The wide variety of items on their menu is pretty impressive for this type of restaurant. Sometimes it either the drinks and dessert that's shit or the food that's shit... but this place has pretty much a good balance of everything so you can enjoy appetizers to snacks to main course to dessert and drinks all in one place!   They have set rice and noodle dishes that are quite unique and portions are gonna fill you up! They also have a mix and match section where you can create your own dishes. Also create your personal mini hotpot too! It starts at $13.99 and the amount it of food it comes with is pretty good, if you eat a lot... they also have add-ons for like $1.50-$5.99.  Most awesome side note... they have vegetarian options! Not many Asian style cuisine have that so it's quite awesome!   Recommendations:  Food&snacks/apps: *Beef hotpot with pork-bone soup/tomato soup (Add rice/glass noodles!) The hotpot package comes with udon, daikon, enoki mushroom, tofu, cabbage, and meat of your choice.  *seafood udon The portion for this was quite huge too. It comes with shrimp, crap meat, corn, and a bunch of stuff I don't remember lol. The soup base was yummy too  *squid balls *veggie stir fry (it has quite a bit of black pepper so if you're not a pepper person... skip it) *chicken wings with herbs  *popcorn chicken   Drinks:  Must must must order the \"white valentine\" it's amazing in your mouth lol. It's lychee soda drink but there's something else mixed inside I can't quite point my tongue on.   Dessert:  They also have a variety of items as well as make your own.  I chose the mix and match coconut milk series and added mango with white pearls."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I ordered the popcorn chicken with Rice and I really enjoyed it! The next time I came back I forgot outdoor drinks weren't allowed but walked into the store with our coco's bubble tea and sat there they told us we weren't allowed outdoor drinks of course so we just told them we're getting take out, they kept glaring at us and when we got our orders we were so disappointed I ordered the popcorn chicken and my friend ordered I think the pork or chicken cutlet I don't remember but it was so over priced I only got like 10 pieces so I basically paid $1 for each piece."}
{"text":"Flaming Kitchen was doing a promotion where if you spend over 28 dollars, you will receive a 10% discount and a free appetizer, which sounded pretty good. We ordered the chicken fillet rice set, popcorn chicken set, pork katsu, and takoyaki. The takoyaki was the free appetizer. The service is alright in the restaurant not spectacular whatsoever. The portions were reasonable. My only issue was the taste of the dishes. The takoyaki and pork katsu were alright--it tasted like it was supposed to taste like. The two other main dishes we had were really salty and also tasted really dry for some reason.   All in all, nothing impressive about this place but maybe give their desserts a try since they have many options on their menu."}
{"text":"Food there is pretty good but service is kinda slow. It is a great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the $9.99 duck breast spicy udon from their specials menu. I really enjoyed the spicy sauce and the dish came sizzling hot which made it even more appetizing and hence 4 stars. For meat lovers though, there weren't very many pieces of duck...so you might be better off ordering the spicy udon with another meat e.g beef and hopefully you will get more meat for your buck. I also ordered the 99 cents honey green tea special to go with my meal. It was regular size and not watered down, which I was quite impressed about. I mean for 99 cents, I can't even order a pop at that price at most restaurants, but right now I am getting a honey green tea, which I would normally have to pay $4+ for!  Overall I had a great lunch and will definitely be back to try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"The service here sucks but I came here twice last weekend because the food was so good. Tried the salmon rice dish and the beef rice dish. My friends tried the salmon and beef rice dish and the curry udon with chicken and beef. What makes the food so good here is the house teppanyaki sauce which we all got with our dishes; a MUST TRY! The rice dishes come with this sauce along with a bit of corn and green onions. Extras are $.50-$1.50 depending on what you choose.  What I mean by the service sucking is they don't pay attention to customers trying to get their attention. The first time we came, we were the only ones in the restaurant and the second time it was completely full. Both times the servers failed to acknowledge us when we needed something. It got to the point where after 10 minutes of trying to ask for more water and the bill, we ended up doing the obnoxious hand raise and they still didn't notice so we went up to them for it. Although the service is the worst here (even for a Chinese establishment), I have to say the food is just that good hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Came here because a co-worker of mine recommended this place. The decor is a bit bland but the food is actually pretty good. I got the Tomato Seafood Udon Soup (pictured below). Price is good, portion size was perfect. They don't hold back on the amount of toppings in it too. Would definitely recommend!  Would've given them 5 stars, but because of the mediocre service I took off two stars. The servers aren't polite or patient (borderline rude). We waited about 25 minutes for our first dish to arrive. We dug into that dish and another ~15-20mins go by and our second dish still hasn't shown up yet. My friend asks if the other dish is coming (because we're almost done eating the first dish) and the waitress literally rolls her eyes at us and says \"it's coming\". Well, excuuuse me for wanting to know whether or or not my friend's dish is arriving before we get full on the first dish.  TL;DR: food is good, service is borderline mediocre."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Convenient location. Good menu choices. Like it that they buried the sauce within your ride so that the sizzling pan won't dry it up.  The place is small, and with the many sizzling plates, the ventilation is poor. Don't like coming out smelling like food."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when I saw the wide selection of dishes Flaming Kitchen offers, and I could not have been more disappointed by today's experience.  I came in a group of 6 and we arrived late afternoon, so we were quickly seated. After deciding on the brownie with red bean and that matcha sauce (~$8.49 before tax?), the waiter took our orders. Our matcha panna cotta and matcha lava cake arrived relatively quickly as well as the main dishes, but all other desserts were quite the wait for no good reason. For one, the first durian parfait took longer than the lava cake to arrive (which is unusual because the lava cake has to bake). Then, the waiter forgot our orders. He had completely forgot about the other durian parfait and my brownie, and had to be reminded about them.  My brownie came last after the reminder to the waiter, and I was disappointed. Not only was the portion TINY for something over $8, but it was extremely disappointing. The matcha sauce? Basically sweetened matcha powder in water. It was disgusting. I asked the waiter if it was supposed to be that way, but he didn't even know. He just told me to pour it on the brownie, but my whole group knew that if it was poured on the brownies, then they'd turn soggy and gross. At least the brownies were good, but the dessert as a whole made my mood sour.  TLDR; come here for their main dishes if there's a good promotion going on -- otherwise, their desserts and prices are not worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Okay so maybe it's because I haven't had quality solid food for a week (wisdom teeth removal), but I left dinner here feeling quite satisfied! I ordered the black curry pork cutlet rice, which was yummy, especially since I love Japanese curry. My friend ordered the Tom Yum chicken rice, which was cheesy and spicy and my friend enjoyed it as well. We also got popcorn chicken as an appetizer which was both soft and crispy! Their desserts looked yummy as well but we did not try them. Would come back! Cash discount for orders $28 or more!"}
{"text":"Honestly, coming into this establishment I didn't have high expectations. Photos however, made the food look amazing but in terms of portions, I wasn't expecting much. Came here an hr before closing and they still took us in so I was happy about that. The menu's pretty overwhelming because everything looked so good along with their desserts. I ordered the spicy chicken flaming noodles $11.99 and added corn to that for $1. It didn't take too long for the food to arrive but then again, they were close to closing.   Food preparation - the platter was definitely sizzling but the food wasn't as hot as I thought it would be considering it was on a sizzling plate. Taste - I loved it. It was like the spicy ramen that everyone's been on but creamier and cheesier making the spice I guess more tolerable? The portion of chicken was also quite generous and they were juicy pieces too. The corn added a little sweetness to all that spice so I will definitely be adding it again when I come back. In terms of portion, I didn't think it would be as filling but it really did fill me up to the brim. It looked small but I really underestimated it. I give it 4/5 stars based SOLELY on this dish because I really surprisingly enjoyed it (even if I think I could probably make this at home).   Tip: they only take debit over $20 but they have an ATM machine located inside their restaurant!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, it wasn't that great of an experience. It took around 30-45 minutes for our food to come out, and we did remind them it was taking quite some time but the waitress didn't do anything about it. It's so annoying because we're just trying to eat and there's no reason for food to take over 30 minutes to be served. We ordered the Crispy Garlic Cheesy Ox-Tongue Rice ($11.99) which was bleh. I'd give it a 3/5 because it was bland. I had higher expectations for this dish. The other dish we ordered was the Spicy Mentaiko Beef Udon ($12.99) which had a yummy sauce (4/5). It seems as if their spicy dishes taste better.. probably because it masks out all the bad/bland flavours lol. We also ordered a vegetarian hot pot which was bland. It just tasted like veggies boiled in water with msg.   The better experience was the second time I came here, I made it in time for their lunch special which was from 12-3pm, and I ordered the udon with duck breast which had the flaming kitchen special spicy sauce for $9.99. I paid an extra $0.99 for a cold honey green tea, which honestly tasted like those 2L green tea jugs you can buy from T&T, nothing wrong with that cause it was still good. However, the spicy duck breast udon was delicious!!! The udon had the perfect chew to it, and the sauce was sooooo yummmy. They also gave quite a few pieces of the duck breast. This dish alone would be getting a 4/5 from me.   All in all, I don't think $13 is worth it for one dish with no drink. With that said, I'll only be coming here for lunch because I do think $10+1 is a good deal for the spicy duck breast dish with the honey green tea. Just sucks that it'll be hard to make it between 12-3pm because we all have work and school. They should do an afternoon tea menu haha."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I'm thinking it's better for dinner as they tend to have more staff and thus the service is better.  Lunch service tends to be slow.  The sizzling plates are delicious and my favourite would have to be the beef  with curried udon.  As for dessert it's also well presented. I had their brownie with ice cream and green tea syrup to pour on top served on a sizzling plate which was nice ( however be conservative on your syrup pouring as it's quite  bitter)."}
{"text":"The food is medicore at best, pricing to portion is also not great. Went with my girlfriend and I had the curry pork cutlets and she had the beef hot plate. We considered ordering more than $28 for their free appetizer offer, but nothing on the appetizer menu looked tasty. We tried it, left and forgot about this place, I can't recommend this place. Came for the hot plate gimmick, not gonna come again.  Ps there's no wifi -1"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were a huge fan of Aka Teppan (previous name). We decided to try out this new place however we were very disappointed. Quality has gone down and just doesn't taste the same as before."}
{"text":"Has a varied selection of food, desserts and teas. Food was as expected. However, service is terribly slow."}
{"text":"Most of my feelings towards the place are in my previous review so I'll post what I got on my second visit.  Rice noodle roll.  Way too tough, not soft at all.  Sauce was meh and for whatever reason, it was spicy.  I don't remember it saying it was spicy on the menu.  I mostly just shrugged it off because there was a small amount of sauce and it wasn't drenched.  Popcorn Chicken Rice.  The popcorn chicken was fantastic.  Cooked perfectly, tasty and juicy.  The problem was my rice.  I don't like most sauces so I asked for just soy sauce on it.  But it was the same stuff that was on the rice noodle roll.  There was a lot of it on this.  This made the rice completely inedible for me.  So I essentially ended up paying $10 for the popcorn chicken.  I also ordered the Miso soup but apparently they ran out of that.  Add to the fact that they only had two staff members taking care of the entire place, it's just not enough.  I don't think our waiter checked up on us once after he took our order and I constantly had to find him to ask for water (to counter the spicy food).  So that was a disappointing dinner experience for me.  I don't think I'll be returning anymore if I can help it.  The food is super pricey and it's very hit or miss."}
{"text":"their hours are inconsistent. its mentioned they close at 11pm but they started kicking people put at 10pm for no reason. otherwise food is pretty average, just didn't appreciate the service."}
{"text":"This was really good! I've been craving their hot rice plates! My daughter loves the rice cake hot plate! Probably the best rice cake ever! It stays hot on the plate which makes it stay soft and perfectly chewy! Love the use of corn in their dishes. They have a nice choice of drinks too. I definitely will go back and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Good good good service. I love the rice Oxford tail  dish and appetizers. I especially love dessert, not that sweet. I would like to come again."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of approximately 10 ppl. The service was good and the food came promptly. I originally thought this place may have been a mistake based on some reviews but for us it wasn't bad. I would love to come back again. The dish I ordered was so good!  Had the build your own noodles and picked Spaghetti with Salmon, Herb Cream dressing (thanks Jackie for recommending) and Black Truffle Sauce. OMG the truffle was definitely worth the additional $3.49. It was heavenly.   Would love to try their desserts next time.   Place was a bit cramped for strollers as with almost all Asian places."}
{"text":"Really fun experience. The sizzling plates were unique and the hot pot was delicious. The service left much to be desired as we were waiting nearly 20 minutes for someone to take our order. When she finally came, she put down a piece of paper and left. Aside from that the food was delicious. The place is very small and fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Cheesy,hot and yummy!  Just what the doctor ordered.  They have a pretty good selection and the food is delicious!  This is a restaurant I would come back to.  I love their hot plate..their cheesy noodles reminds me of Mac and Cheese.  Asia's version of Mac and Cheese!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. I actually do like the food. Nothing special but it is good and different."}
{"text":"I went with my friends today and ordered Japanese curry beef udon lunch special. It was very delicious! However the staffs serving us were very unfriendly and hostile for some reason. It can't be because it was busy, the store was half empty during that time. When my friend asked a question about the menu, the hostess said, 'I don't know what are saying' and rolled her eyes. We tried to love this place simply because the food was good but I don't think we will be back because of the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"- Food is just okay  - Extra toppings are over priced. $1 for green onions? You should just add green onions to begin with. Most places like this have green onion or an egg already on the order.  - had the exact meal in Vancouver for much less money.  - would not go again, due to price."}
{"text":"I had the spicy metaiko beef udon and honestly, it was good. Lots of sauce and flavour for the hot plate. There wasn't a long wait for food as well but service was NOT good. I felt really rushed for no reason, as all the tables were not occupied, nor were there people at the door. The server was rude and seemed like she didn't want to be there. 2 stars were taken off for the poor service. If you do not care for service, then their beef udon is worth a try."}
{"text":"One of my fav spots to go for a hearty meal on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place as it had been highly recommended by a friend. Finally got the opportunity to do so today. I went in at around 1 pm and it wasn't busy. I was seated right away.   The service was excellent - I didn't have to wait long for anything and the waitress refilled my water several times without having to be asked.   I ordered their popular dish which was the spicy chicken noodles for $12.99. What can I say about it?   I liked the chicken better than the ramen.  The chicken was nice and flavourful and the ramen was ok.  The combination was interesting and I liked it, but I didn't love it.  Also, for $13, I thought portions were on the smaller side.   Overall, great service, good food, but less quantity."}
{"text":"Flaming Kitchen is located in First Markham Place and serves personal hotplate meals. The concept is from Pepper Lunch in Japan. Hot metal plates that are heated to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. raw meat with vegetables and/or rice are then placed on the plates, where they cook in front of the customer. The meat can be eaten rare or well done, depending on the customer's preference.  The restaurant is located in the same location as Aka Teppan before and they have had a complete rebranding. The menu was revemped with lots more dessert additions, with over 15 pages of food ranging from snacks, hot plates, dessert, and bubble tea drinks.   Appetizers We tried a variety of appetizers which are mostly fried. Flaming Kitchen is quite generous with the portion of their appetitizer so it is best to be shared among a few persons  Curry Fries is made with Japanese curry served on a hotplate. We love Japanese curry and their sweet and spicy flavor, and it goes perfectly well with the fries.  Tom Yum Shrimp  were lightly crisp and were really plump in texture. The tom yum sauce was flavourful but and gives a spicy kick.  These two are must try for all cheese fans: Bite Sized Cheese and Cheese Rice Cake. Both are made with a lot of cheese and the melted cheese on the sizzling hot plate just taste so good  Main Spicy Mentaiko Beef Udon is an interesting twist on Japanese udon. The udon texture was done perfectly with the right amount of cheesy sauce and a bit of spice from the mentaiko. It is also very satisfying to see the beef cooked on the hot plate right in front of you.  Jumbo Scallop Spaghetti with Truffle Cream Sauce has a very rich sauce and also very strong truffle flavor. The scallop is really jumbo in size and blend in well with the spaghetti.  In the revemped menu there are also lots of desserts and drinks. We tasted the Panna Cotta and Sizzling Marshmallow Waffle. The waffle was very cute since it is served on a small metal pan and definitely very Instagrammable.  Overall we enjoyed Flaming Kitchen and would come back for more sizzling hot plates."}
{"text":"Very small portion for the price. Food tasted funny.  Won't come back again, won't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 , Service 4/5  Lunch visit with my girlfriend, we had their sizzling udon, their food is flavourful! I ordered their lunch special, sizzling plate of curry beef udon. The beef slices are similar to T&T hot pot beef which is too dry. The udon was cooked well, chewy. The curry has a good strong bolder taste of, not spicy that covered the udon well, it was just the right amount of sauce in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Located in a huge plaza with many food options to choose from. Huge parking lot but always seems hard to find a parking spot as I always have trouble finding a close spot. I would recommend this place for sizzling plate enthusiasts! We got the spicy mentaiko beef udon and beef supreme with rice. The beef was tender and delicious as well as the udon + sauce! However the mentaiko sauce kind of tasted like a spicy version of mac and cheese. Portions were a little small as well as they only give you a few slices of beef. We still left hungry after.   Service was good, they were quick to delivering our food which we appreciated as we were in a bit of a rush. They don't take credit cards so make sure you got cash or debit with you!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:  It's not the roomiest of restaurants, but they do pretty well arranging the tables and space. Decor is pretty simple, with a clean look.  FOOD:  I ordered the \"Scallops with Truffle Cream Sauce\" sizzling plate based off of foodie extraordinaire Cherrie T's recommendation, and it was in fact quite good. The scallops were fairly big, and I could actually taste the truffle in the creamy sauce. More than enough noodles as well.  The \"Okonomiyaki Fries\" stole the show for me. Like the \"Shake Shake Fries,\" these fries were nice and crispy, and well seasoned. The sizzling plate it came on kept it warm, though it wasn't needed given how fast we scarfed it down!  SERVICE:  A bit on the slow side, as my dish did come much after everybody else at my table. I'll give them a pass though, given they were pretty busy that night. Didn't notice anything either way about the service, so it must have been good enough.  VERDICT:  I'll be back for the fries, and to tries the other sizzling plates."}
{"text":"Ordered cumin lamb rice. Found a piece of hair before eatting it. Told the waitress right away, I was shocked that the waitress did, she used bare hand to pick it out. AND THAT'S IT. After ate it had stomach pain. Not sure if I wanna come back again.  Would give zero star if I can."}
{"text":"Satisfying!  Staffs are very friendly, love the Tom Yum Spaghetti, and the Strawberry Parfait."}
{"text":"Way to saucy.   I got the salmon and beef with udon plate.  I thought the dishes were pretty cool though, how it sizzles but too much sauce on them. My salmon dish had so much pepper, and i had to eat so much ride with that. The beef with udon was really good! The beef quality was very tender, a lot better than some other places. *thumbs up*"}
{"text":"Went out with a couple of friends and got some dessert at this place. First off the place is pretty nice (probably open within the last couple months I think or within the last year to be safe). The menu and pictures were also well presented. I ordered the marshmallow waffle, in the menu it was black sesame ice cream, followed by toasted marshmallow and a waffle underneath on a hot plate. I asked the server if I could replace the ice cream with vanilla instead and they were very hesitant with what they could do to simply switch the flavour. It took a while to get, and it was very underwhelming. If the ice cream got on the hot plate it made it warm and the waffle was literally an eggo waffle..... my other friends ordered the green tea brownie and chocolate parfait. My friend asked what goes into the green tea brownie dish but was still hesitant of what went into it and pretty much left her not knowing what she just ordered. She said the green tea brownie was really good but everything else (tofu and red bean) did not go well together. Overall the service should look at more ways to improve their knowledge of the menu. Or at least have the contents of the dish written on the menu. Not a fan of the dessert menu but if I ever come back I wouldn't mind trying the main dishes they serve."}
{"text":"If you've been to Aka Teppan (the predecessor at the same location) then you're in for a similar experience. The menu has been greatly expanded with newly enlarged selections of appetizers, drinks, and desserts. They also allow you to construct your own salad or sizzling plate.   We started with Spicy Shake Shake Fries as an appetizer. It's a paper bag with fries and a shaker of spicy powder for you to combine. On the plus side, you can control exactly how spicy you want your fries. I had the Black Curry Beef Udon for my main. It arrived on a sizzling hot plate exactly as advertised. Make sure to flip your beef or it will stick to the plate. The noodles don't suffer from the same problem because they're covered in the curry sauce. I found the mild curry to be pleasant, but not memorable. I did manage to also try the Flaming Chicken Spicy Noodle which definitely lived up to its name."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to AKA Teppan, but Flaming Kitchen is pretty much the exact same with more options. I got my usual Spicy Mentaiko Udon which was delicious as always, and shared the Curry Poutine and the Okonomiyaki Fries. The Okonomiyaki are definitely better IMO as the Curry Poutine was a bit watery and bland. Another couple of appetizers that I recommend are the fried mushrooms and cheesy rick cakes.  Careful of the hot plates though, or you might burn yourself!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant's predecessor Aka Teppan. The menu has expanded but it is essentially a revamp of the old restaurant. They specialize in sizzling rice and udon dishes on a hot plate, with a variety of meats and sauces to choose from. There is a good selection of snacks like wings, fries, curry poutine and fried cheese. My favourite dish is the Spicy Mentaiko udon with beef. I have also had the curry chicken and duck breast with rice/pasta. I give it 3 stars because while the food is tasty, the service is a little slow and the prices are a little high for what you're getting."}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch experience.  Flaming Kitchen has a decent lunch selection starting from $8.99. Food is a dollar or 2 cheaper but I like the option of adding cold/hot Honey Green Tea for 99 cents.  Sizzling Duck Breast Spicy Udon ($10.99) was delicious! I love the chewiness of the udon as they were not overcooked. The dish though a little too saucy and I did wish for more udon to soak up all the sauce.   Portion wise might not be enough if you are hungry. If you are looking for a light lunch or to leave room for dessert, this maybe for you.  Service was friendly as there was only 1 waitress working that afternoon. Food did take awhile, so don't come here expecting for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Under staffed on a Sunday lunch. Had 5 adults, 2 toddler one baby. None of the food were sizzling, drinks were missing, charged us 15% trips on the bill. No credit card payment. Will never never go again."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place now that there's a location in scarborough.   Food wise it's ok.  I wouldn't get the salad cus the portions are tiny.  You're better of with the rice dishes.  Desserts aren't too sweet which is good."}
{"text":"I think the 3 star overall rating for flaming chicken is fair. Until March 10 you get 10% off your order and a free appetizer if you spend more than $28. The spicy flaming chicken noodles are too cheesy and heavy for my liking but the mantaiko beef udon was good! I love how soft the udon noodles are. Popcorn chicken was also great, and the shake fries are good but nothing special. Overall there isn't a particular dish that I would come back for."}
{"text":"Got the sizzling beef on rice, the flavor of the dish was okay but the sizzling plate was too hot. So hot that it burnt a lot of my rice even though I mixed it. It stayed hot for a little too long. Nothing too special about the dish and its not comparable to the well known fast food chain that serves this same dish in Hong Kong known as pepper lunch. This restaurant seems like its lacking something.   For desserts, I tired their strawberry parfait. The strawberry ice cream was really sweet and tasted really artificial. Seems like cheap ice cream that you get from a grocery store. It was topped with some jelly and other stuff. But the jelly was really chewy and lacked flavor. Not recommended.  The yelp check in bonus apparently doesn't work anymore. So no free drink. But they said they cant remove the check in bonus from the yelp page.   Overall, this restaurant is alright, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Marginal Diminishing Propensity to Consume. ^^ srry, im a nerd ahaha jks The more you eat here, the less you want to eat here :)  The first time I came here was with my best friend, of course. I ordered the black curry pork cutlet rice and white valentine. My friend ordered the Korean spicy beef rice and lavendar milk tea. We also ordered a mango parfait to share.  Since then, I've returned on several occasions and tried the spicy mentaiko beef udon, cheesy tteobokki, and popcorn chicken.  The best thing at this place is, hands down, the spicy mentaiko beef udon. It's the SAUCE. The sauce is creamy and just leaves you wanting more. its delicious! Their cheesy tteobokki appetizer uses the same sauce and I just love it! Since the appetizer is just as filling and cheaper, I usually opt for just the tteobokki :3  Everything else is mediocre. I enjoyed the white valentine, but it's definitely overpriced, same with the popcorn chicken.   Just don't get their parfait. The frosted flakes cereal was the main bulk of it. I tried my best, but I couldn't eat more than 7 bites.  Sometimes when I crave the spicy mentaiko sauce, I drop by. I highly recommend the cheesy tteobokki!! :)"}
{"text":"Nothing beats the sizzling plates here. The beef quality is far superior than Mabu - thicker cuts and better marinated. I'm not sure what the change is since the renovations but it feels like the old Aka Teppan! There's definitely more interesting menu items now with a page dedicated to durian desserts  would definitely recommend the spicy mentaiko beef udon!  And the drinks are really well made, I usually wouldn't order but I love how their Taro Milk Green Tea taste (not powder like, real tea taste) and their Mango drinks!"}
{"text":"Yikes, I did not like this place.   I came here one night with a friend, and it was relatively not busy. I ordered the pork cutlet curry while she got a parfait. Service was pretty standard for an Asian place (so neither great nor terrible).   The food was so bitter. I didn't understand why. First off, the cutlet was more like a thin sheet of breading. I couldn't even tell if there was pork in it. Maybe it was burnt and that's why it was so bitter, but even without that, the rest of the dish wasn't good. The curry didn't taste like curry, more just like some vague brown sauce. You could literally only taste the sweetness of the corn mixed with bitterness and black pepper.   My friend's parfait wasn't faring any better. She gave me a little bit to try, and I found it so meh. Not even average, just meh. She felt the same way. She described it as just cereal, yogurt, and ice cream. There was no wow factor or even anything to make her think it was worthwhile to eat as a dessert. She ended up not finishing it.   Look, maybe we ordered the wrong items. I saw some people eating udon and that looked pretty good, so I'm willing to give this place the benefit of doubt and return one day. Based off first impressions though, I am beyond disappointed in Flaming Kitchen, especially since I had heard from my peers that it was a pretty good place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once during their soft opening and again during their grand opening weekend for their buy one get one free promotion.I suspect that this is Aka Teppan rebranded as the the menu is basically the same.  On our first trip, we came on a Tuesday night and there were not a lot of people in the restaurant. Service was quick and efficient and the food was pretty good. We got the Mentaiko Beef #Udon ($12.99) and the Supreme Beef #Rice ($9.99).   The Udon was spot on with nice soft chewy noodles. It was also quite tasty as it was coated with a cheesy, spicy sauce. The Supreme Beef had several rolls of thinly sliced beef surrounding a mountain of rice which is topped with corn and green onions. I also added garlic bits (+$0.99) which is key as it mixes perfectly with the sauce that is hidden inside the rice. On the sizzling plate, the rice develops a \"skin\" with a wonderful crunchy and chewy texture. My only complaint was that there was not enough sauce in the middle as it it could have used a little more flavour. I ended up using the sauce left over from the udon on the rice and it was absolutely divine.  For dessert, we got the Mango Parfait and the Durian Parfait ($8.49). The mango parfait was ok. It came with granola, mango ice cream, whip cream and some cereal. Nothing special. I liked the durian parfait though - but I love anything durian and may be a little biased. Like the mango parfait, there was cereal and whipped cream layered at the bottom of the cup. I found the cereal a little too sweet (probably Frosted Flakes) but it was tempered a little by the cream. There were two scoops of durian ice cream topped with some boba as well as some fresh durian on top. The ice cream cone on top looks interesting but was a little messy to eat.  I thought the food was ok and therefore went back for a second time with friends for their grand opening buy one get one free special a week later.  The restaurant was much busier that night. We were quoted a 30 minute wait but it was probably around 45 minutes. Upon seating we ordered a variety of different plates and even considered getting two plates each since it seemed like great value (basically half off).  We started off with the shake shake fries which were pretty bad. They were basically mediocre fries with some seasoning that you shake into a brown paper bag. The seasoning wasn't very flavourful and I would say this was more gimmicky than anything else.  Our main dishes came out staggered (probably about 4-5 minutes apart) which is not ideal if you have a larger party since dishes get cold or meats can get overcooked if you do the whole waiting for everyone's dish to arrive before eating. Given that it was the grand opening, and it was pretty busy, I can understand but I thought it was worth mentioning.  This time, in addition to the dishes we had last time, we also tried a few new dishes. The Popcorn Chicken Rice ($9.99) is fairly simple but that isn't always a bad thing. The chicken was juicy inside and crunchy on the outside. There was more sauce inside the rice this time which was good.   The Angus Steak Rice was the least impressive value wise. Unlike the picture on the menu, the steak comes delivered already cooked in the sizzling platter. This would suck for someone like me who prefers her steak medium rare and juicy. It comes with some veggies and rice on the side as well as your choice of black pepper or tepanyaki sauce. At $19.99, I would say this is not worth it... Even with the BOGO Free promo.  The Flaming Chicken Spicy Noodles ($11.99) seemed to be just some instant noodles with cheese sauce and some chicken thrown in. Not incredibly impressed with this dish.  This was an ok place to eat given the grand opening promo. Dishes are a hit and miss here and if I were to return, I would probably stick to the beef Supreme, the mentaiko udon or the popcorn chicken. The portions are not particularly big though and at full price, I would say that it's not a great value."}
{"text":"They make some killer udons and durian desserts! Large selection between snacks, meals and desserts. The menu was also very cute which is a plus. Staff were friendly and place was clean. Will definitely come back and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"For the appetizer we got the shake shake fries in seaweed.. which tasted like costco French fries and not much flavor even with the seaweed powder that they offer you to add on yourself.   For dinner the tables favorite was the truffle scallop spaghetti and the spicy mentaiko beef udon. I preferred the chewiness of the udon over the spaghetti.  I wouldn't order their curry dishes again since it feels like something that I can easily make at home. The curry udon and rice dishes just taste like the packaged Japanese curry that you get from the grocery story."}
{"text":"Warning, definitely not enough air conditioning. Be prepared to sweat throughout the meal ! According to the server, they've been opened for just two weeks now so things seem to be running smoothly. The internal temperature might improve.  Service is pretty good, the servers will come by to check on the table and to refill water. The interior colour scheme seems to be red and white. The red leather chairs were a bit uncomfortable to sit on as the meal progressed. It was too warm and it felt a bit sticky on the skin.  Presentation was expected, bubbling hot plates of food protected by a warning label. The fried pork cutlet was a bit on the dry side, definitely needed to be covered in the curry sauce. The \"jumbo\" scallops seemed kind of small and one of them was only half the size of the other two. The truffle cream sauce was really flavourful and not over seasoned, just right. The hamburg was really moist and tasted great but the cabbage on the side didn't really cook down so that was disappointing. The sauce was place in a metal container in the centre of the sizzling plate, don't think that was the best idea.  Overall, will come back again. The food was decent but maybe when the weather is colder."}
{"text":"I'd seen some delicious looking instagram posts and decided to come check it out. Turns out the previous restaurant also had hot plates.   We had come after 1 pm on a weekday so there wasn't a wait for a table. The menu is quite large so it took sone time to flip through it all and then decide. We found that the flavours in the curry sauce was a bit too strong for our tastes but I liked the teppanyaki sauce."}
{"text":"I've come a few times since they've changed to kitchen. The first time ii came with a bunch of Yelp folks. It was great trying out new items. Check out Philips review.   I like the new menu. There's more of everything.   Location: In first Markham place.  Parking: If you come in prime time, around suppertime get someone else to drive or park farther away.   Decor: Seating is tables or booths, its a smallish space but I go out to eat before 7 so there's seats and The sizzling plates come quick. Also I've made reservations. It helps with getting a seat. No wait   They took off all the previous decor, its plain inside  Food: Whenever I've gone it's been in groups of 6 or more.  The first time there was 8. We've tried,. The chicken cartilage, ( was weird but deep fried so good), popcorn chicken, 5 spice wings, meatballs with cheese ( yummy), oh the shrimp app - very good.  I tried the supreme sizzling plate. That was the only thing I wasn't too keen on. Its kinda plain compared to what it used to be. It used to be nice and peppery. Not anymore. Can't recommend it. The beef tongue sizzling plate was good as well as the scallop and noodles.  There's some cool desserts. If you like durian there's a bunch. Someone ordered durian balls. I didn't try it but there was no durian smell so no worries the place doesn't smell like death. Haha I tried the parfait twice. I love it. It's like cereal and granola with ice cream and whipped cream yum. Ooh and the smore waffle. That was just ok the waffle is not the fluffy sweet ones that I like . It does come with ice cream as well. I prefer the parfait.   Staff: Service is great if it's not busy. When it's busy it can be slow. But when you come as a large group it gives you time to catch up and take your time eating apps.   Conclusion: I've been a few times and we've never had anything wrong. But I do make reservations and we come before 7. I've read some of the reviews and honestly never had any of the problem the others had but  I come early which I find makes a huge difference"}
{"text":"I didn't really like this place at all. I ordered the spicy mentaiko beef udon and my partner ordered the Korean spicy beef rice. I wanted to give this place a try since it is a new restaurant, but the flavour of the two entrées we got were really disappointing. The udon has a lot of sauce but there was actually no flavour to it and neither does the beef. I also tried a bit of the rice and there was nothing special about that dish either. The wait time was long as well (around 30-45 mins) which is expected since it is a new restaurant and we also went on a weekend night. The servers don't approach you at the door either, so you actually have to go up to the front of the kitchen and ask for a number. I don't know, I may or may not come back to try the appetizers or desserts, but I definitely won't be ordering the same items on the menu if I do."}
{"text":"Saw tons of instagram photos of their food and had to try it. As per several other reviews, the service was quite slow. We arrived about 20 minutes after it opened and it wasn't crowded to begin with. There should not have been any back up in the kitchen with so few tables. There seem to be only one server for the whole place. I give it 3 1/2 stars mostly due to the slow service.  I tried the lavender milk tea which sounded fairly unique and with this year's lavender craze I couldn't help myself. It had a fresh and flavourful taste and was even garnished with some lavender buds. Although it tasted great on its own I have to say it did not pair particularly nicely with a spicy dish or curry.  We did not order any appetizers as our party of two decided to save room for dessert instead!  We ordered the flaming spicy chicken noodle which was spicy but I would consider it a hotter medium. It's not the kind of space that lingers but it does have a Nice kick to it. There are a few pieces of chicken that come with it on a sizzling plate served with splash guards. The cheese on the noodle made it a little less boring but it still seems like the dish with missing something. It did not seem like a particularly large dish but it could have been the grease or the cheese that made it quite filling.  The black curry pork cutlet udon soup had better assortment of ingredients. The cutlet was a good size and crispy although it was served in the soup. The curry reminds me a little of Manpuku Japanese curry udon.   We topped off our meal with the green tea lava cake with vanilla ice cream. It was served with a bit of red bean which was a nice treat. It was tasty but not quite flowing lava when we stabbed it open. The cake was crispy on the outside and warm on the inside. Not sure if it's made in house or what, but I was not disappointed.   So all in all, worth a repeat visit, just pack your patience!"}
