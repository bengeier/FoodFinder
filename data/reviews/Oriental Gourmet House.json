{"text":"The place will be closed down April 20th, 2012 :( They have not decided when/where to have the new location. But if you are interested in getting updates regarding the new location, you can drop by the restaurant and leave them your email addresses...all in all it is sad :'("}
{"text":"Expect chaos between 11:59am and 1:30pm but often worth jamming yourself into the small waiting space and into the crammed rooms full of tables.  

Portions are large and inexpensive for the financial district.  Service is lightning fast and table turnover is encouraged.  I get the sense MSG is used here - often feel a bit fuzzy after an hour or so but that could be from the quantity of food.  Don't order more than one dish per person.  

Oh and expect to smell like Chinese food after (not the best location on a day when a suit is required)."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch at least once a month.  Great cantonese food in the downtown core."}
{"text":"This nondescript restaurant on Temperance is an excellent lunch time spot. I've been here a couple of times with a friend from work, and the dishes are delicious and quite generous, and service is quick. It doesn't look like much from the street, but the place is always packed ... mostly with Asians which is a good sign. I haven't had anything yet that I didn't absolutely enjoy."}
{"text":"This place happens to be attached to my office, so I come here semi-regularly. As is often my custom, I've only ever ordered one dish, the \"spicy\" Pad Thai. It has never one been spicy, but it's always been delicious.

Not amazing food, but good portions and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It's a challenge when trying to find Chinese food within the Financial District, but this restaurant found its niche among the high-end restaurants around. It is hidden away on Temperance St. & Yonge, and the uninspiring exterior can make it easy to walk pass. 

But don't let that fool you, as you'd be surprised that the food they serve here is decent and comes in generous portions. For such a small shop, there is a wide variety of dishes. 

Though I have only ordered take-out from here, it can get quite packed during the lunch rush hour. From the point of my call to pick up, it only took them 15 mins to have it all ready. 

Definitely a nice addition if you want a good, quick, and affordable option within the Financial District. 

Note: Not opened on Sundays."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. 

The is a hygiene issue here. They dropped(!!) my plate of stir-fried veggies and then picked it up and tried to serve it to me. Gross."}
{"text":"Eating at this restaurant is the only thing I miss about working in the Financial District. Okay, maybe getting a steady paycheque too. But other than that, I dearly miss not being able to enjoy their food on a regular basis.

If you want good Cantonese meals, come here. Be advised that the lunch hour is the most chaotic time. Expect a line up of people waiting to be seated from 11:45am to 1:30pm, respectively. But the restaurant does a great job at keeping the flow moving so you never have to wait long for a table. 

If you prefer to eat outside or bring the food back to your desk, they have take-out. 

The majority of the patrons are suits but don't let this deter you from going. It has a very relaxing atmosphere, and you get a variety of people who work in the area who want to enjoy a simple meal when not in Chinatown.

My friend and I would always share a plate of deep-fried squid (the best I think in the city), and stir-fried veggies. With a complimentary green tea and a pop, our order came up to $20. Also, their curry chicken dish and crispy noodles are excellent. 

Try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best place for Cantonese food in the financial district.  Service is super quick, food is good, and prices are much lower than going to a food court.  I'm always amazed at how efficient and accurate everyone at the front and in the kitchen are with so many orders."}
