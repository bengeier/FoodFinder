{"text":"Omg! What a great place. Autumn, Eric, Daniel  and especially  Arlina are the best! We got the best service ever. Both ladies helped us get where we were going with our baby. Xoxo ladies! Until next time!"}
{"text":"I had the same experience as Addison P.  I went here for restaurant week and the crab soup was bland, the shrimp were questionable, the Mac and cheese was bland, and my filet mignon was like a McDonald's burger. The asparagus were tasty as was the bread they served prior to the appetizer. My cheesecake dessert was good but it looked like something from the freezer from the grocery store and not something made in house. I was so excited to try this place after seeing the beautiful photos of food on their website but the food I was served look nothing like the photo of the same dish on the website. Won't be coming back even with all the coupons they gave me with my bill."}
{"text":"Exceeds expectations! Best meal of the week!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, it looks very nice with the table cloths, right on the street, perfect for people watching and the small and regular sizes of wine.... But it went downhill from them.  While our waiter was very friendly he was not very good at his job.  We went there early, about 630pm and were the only people in the place.  The waiter came over and offer us drinks, all was great.  I really liked that I could get small size of wine (4oz) and double that, the typical size cost just double (no savings for larger size). They brought some strange tasting rolls and oil with balsamic vinegar but the oil was rancid, no doubt about it.  When the waiter finally came after chatting with the bartender I said could we please have some butter, I think the oil was rancid, he said of course, brought some butter and left the oil on the table. We then had our salads, tasty although a bit tart and our entrees, vegetable lasagna, not the best but edible and trout, very fishy, not fresh with asparagus.   The waiter never came to check on our meals.  He then sent the busboy to clean our table who very politely asked if I wanted a box when he saw my place almost full, I said no, that the fish was very fishy, he didn't say anything, just remove the plate. We didn't dare try the desserts, maybe that is the good part... I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for business lunches.  For $10.95 they have a lunch buffet that includes soup, salad and some hot dishes and a drink. I always order off the menu. Prices run under $15 for entrees, and the sizes are pretty generous."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week.  Started with an awesome cocktail and the food was amazing.  Short ribs and rabbit was our main courses both were amazing.  I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"My first time trying out this restaurant and I surely do not regret it at all. Went to the place with colleague from work, for some reason I complain about the lack of good lunch places in Charlotte downtown .   The ambience was great , it was quiet and clean unlike other places here which allows me to have a conversation without raising and screaming to compensate for the background noise.  For lunch, they had a complementary salad and dessert buffet which is definitely a BIG plus. The salads were also pretty good.   For entree ordered some pasta which was pretty good too. The option of selecting the size of the entree is also a plus.   Overall, a great lunch / date place."}
{"text":"Caffe Siena provides the catering and room service for the Holiday Inn City Center in Charlotte, NC. I ordered room service two evenings and lunch one day and the food was prompt, hot, and quite tasty. The salmon salad and the field greens salad were both very fresh. I also ate the pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes and green beans and asparagus. The pork could have used just a touch more of the mushroom sauce, but overall I would order it again.  I absolutely can't recommend their service enough, though. My food arrived quickly and everyone was so nice. They were also willing to accommodate lunch orders for my training event which meant the food was hot and ready when we took our break right at noon."}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 people for a business dinner on a Wednesday night.  Generally, the meal was pretty good.  I liked the she-crab soup and the salad looked very fresh.  Meal was well-paced although our server spent a lot of time talking with other servers at the bar (the place was almost empty).  I had the steak which was a little overcooked.  I'm not sure why they bake it in the oven rather than throw it on the grill though.  The asparagus was just right and the lobster mac-n-cheese good too.  We didn't stay for dessert so I can't speak to that.    This wouldn't be a good choice for a special evening but it was just fine for the occasion."}
{"text":"Since the closure of Therapy has caused us to keep our eye out for hidden martini locations we popped in to Sienna Cafe on our way to Cosmos.  There was an infused martini special and it was worth the stop.  As previously mentioned in other reviews, it was pretty dead in there on a Saturday night around 7PM.   That said, you can take your pick of bar seating, lounging around on some comfy couches or opting for the small patio in the back.   If you just want to have a quiet conversation with some friends or you can't get a group into some of the other more packed places for happy hour, I'd say stop on by and take advantage of the drink specials.  I can't say I'd commit to a meal here until I tried some small plates or appetizers first."}
{"text":"Caffe Siena is in the Holiday Inn building; it's next to Mert's and across the street from Fuel.  The decor in this place is elegant, yet the atmosphere is very cozy. I had passed on this place many times in my quest for lunch because I assumed it would be too expensive and uptight. When I finally did go in, I found a moderately priced lunch menu with excellent quality.  The main focus here is Italian. The pastas and pizzas are excellent, and the paninis are very large and unique. The lunch menu varies, but you can request your favorite and they will usually have the ingredients available to make what you want. Dinner is more expensive, but you are also looking at steaks, veal, and lobster instead of paninis and pizza. Everything I've had here has been excellent. I particularly like their antipasto, the cioppino, and the rigatoni with the huge meatballs.  I've noticed that lately they have a buffet during lunch. It's not the same buffet every day. I've seen Mexican and Italian so far. Unfortunately I can't comment on how it tastes since I always go for the pasta or pizza.  They have a nice patio area that's right on College. If the traffic is not too bad then it's a great place to relax and chat with a friend. This is also an excellent place for a nice intimate dinner. It's quiet, cozy, and not uptight at all."}
{"text":"Once again I would like to give my favorite restaurant a two thumbs up!!!!  I dont know where to start... Good food,  reasonable princes,  excellent Internet connection and great service in a semi formal relaxing atmosphere. And the music is not bad either.  Amy is the best. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Pass - had valentines dinner there and needless to say most was lacking flavor - the corn risotto was thick like it had been over cooked. The shrimp and scallops were chewy - I'm guessing they were frozen not fresh. Not worth the money - won't be back."}
{"text":"I ate at Caffe Siena on January 21st for Charlotte Restaurant week.  I always like to try new places during restaurant week and our group of 4 decided to give this place a try.  The menu looked good and we gave it a try.  We were promptly seated and greeted by our servers (one was training that night - though at times it was tough to tell which one it was).  We were given the restaurant week menus as well as wine menus.  The wine menu was fairly short and nothing really jumped off the page at us.  I asked about beer selection and was disappointed that they only carried the standard domestics and imports.  Many restaurants around Charlotte have begun carrying more craft beers, but this one is behind on the times.  Two of us had the sea bass cake and the other two had the lobster bisque.  The sea bass cake is touted as \"award-winning\" and while it was good, it wasn't anything fantastic.  The lobster bisque was a bit underwhelming with the amount of lobster included, though flavor was good.  I had the duck breast as my entree and thought it was cooked very well and was accompanied by a nice port wine reduction.  The cous cous and vegetables were somewhat bland and only made better by combining them with the sauce.  Everyone else had the filet and grilled shrimp and they all cleaned their plates.  For dessert I had the creme brulee and it was ok, but a little over done on the top.  It should be a nice brown, not black on top.  Everyone else had the Nutella crepe and I think they were a little disappointed with it.  The service was mediocre.  The waitresses were prompt with our food, but weren't real knowledgeable about things.  For example, I asked her to validate my parking and she signed the ticket.  I figured this was not right, and asked the host about it and was given proper instructions on going to the front desk (it's in the Holiday Inn) and have them scan it.  I would expect a waitress who is training another waitress to know something like that."}
{"text":"Great Food. The lobster Mac and cheese here is awesome. I've had to opportunity to eat here dozens of times and as long as you stay away from the simple stuff their food is great.  Some of the best steaks uptown ! The cooks are great and awesome staff. Courtney the manager candice the bartender and tamika the server always make my day."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for the breakfast Buffett. Slow response time by our server when we fist got here. The eggs and B&G was very good and the bacon was perfect. A little pricey but overall a good experience and some place I would return to."}
{"text":"I can remember when restaurants that occupy space in hotels were places to avoid and not at all sought out by the foodie crowd.  Since that's no longer a barometer by which to determine where a good meal can be found, we checked out Caffe Siena and were pleasantly surprised.  We were a group of 7, seated in the back room, treated quite well by staff (Jenna was great!), and most importantly, the food was great.    As a nice start, the staff was kind enough to bring out complimentary apps - calamari and Mediterranean Meze (hummus, avocado puree and caponata).  Both were good - and good sized portions as well.  We also ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese Terrine (loved it but could have used a bit more salt) and Sea Bass Cake (nice change from the usual crab cake). The best was the chipotle slaw served with the sea bass - delightful flavors and I wanted to use a warm roll to sop up the juices but using my best table manners, I deferred (drats!).  By the time the entrees arrived, I was a bit stuffed but onward and upward anyway.  Entrees ordered by the group included Roasted Pork Tenderloin (my choice and it was tender, flavorful and worth going back just for this dish), Chicken Marsala (heard this was quite good), Veggie Paella, Frutti Di Mare (looked amazing and our buddy was totally into this dish).  Clearly I missed an entree or two but I was too focused on my own dish to look up.   If I could change one thing and offer up a suggestion - enhance the wine list.  Not very much there; the wines were adequate but nothing special.  We did order wines but were unimpressed so the overall dining experience was just a tad diminished as a result.    Caffe Sienna - we really liked you and I'm going with 4-stars.  See you again soon."}
{"text":"I work in the building that is connected to Cafe Siena.  There are literally hundreds of people who walk right past this place to other places to eat.    Today I found out why.  After looking though yelp for a new lunch place I found Cafe Siena and was reminded how close it was.  The menu looked good.  I went downstairs and went in.  Noone greeted me, so I walked up to the bar.  No bartendar,  but a couple people sitting at the bar having lunch.  I sat for a little less than 10 minutes browsing on my phone.  No greeting from anyone, it appeared that the staff was actively avoiding eye contact with me as they flitted about.  Finally I gave up when I saw another patron irritatingly having to flag a waiter down to get his check. Noone tried to engage me on the way out the door.    So I went down the street to Cosmos, which is awesome.  They greeted me, took my order and had me taken care of quickly.  I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Food was a little rich for me, but my kids loved it. The service was excellent--efficient, generous and friendly."}
{"text":"Just okay! My spouse and I plus one other couple went during restaurant week. We had the lobster Mac and cheese during taste of Charlotte...it was delish so we decided to try the restaurant. We went to the restaurant on a Saturday night and the restaurant was not full at all...that should have been the first sign. The BBQ slider was good but the chicken cannoli was flavorless. The seafood mix entree was unseasoned and the desserts were just ok. We kept eyeing the Chinese restaurant across the street haha. We definitely won't be back to pay a bunch of money for just average food."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week and read the reviews prior to coming. I thought a lot of them were outdated and I would give this place a shot.   I got the sea bass cake to start. I have never had a sea bass cake, so I didn't really know what to expect. I thought it was very good. The chipotle coleslaw had good flavor to it. Not too hot, just the right amount of kick.  For my entree, I had the filet mignon with grilled shrimp and lobster mac and cheese. The lobster mac and cheese tasted like it was once frozen and I think I had maybe three pieces of lobster in it. Just not good at all. Also, the asparagus was really lacking flavor. I ordered the filet medium rare, it came out with just a hint of pink in the middle. I am not a filet mignon temperature pro, but I do believe it was cooked a little more than it should have been. I ate it without complaining. The two grilled shrimp were just ok, again not a lot of flavor.   Lastly, I had the classic style cheesecake. I wasn't impressed. Nice presentation, but it only came with half of a strawberry and it was not made in house.   Our server was great. He was very attentive to us and we did not feel rushed throughout the night.  Nothing, really \"wowed\" me enough to come back or recommend it to others. I'm glad I tried it but overall the food lacked flavor and it was obvious most of the deserts are not made in house."}
{"text":"I happen to work in the building next to Caffe Siena and go fairly frequently for breakfast with colleagues to catch up and sometimes for lunch.  Good food, great service, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"They seem to be struggling from an identity crisis. It's called caffe Siena so you think coffee house but no...it's an Italian restaurant. After getting over the initial shock, the meal was mediocre at best.  Nothing really wowed us and we were really looking forward to our date night."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the fancy Italian name, the trendy decor, or the other misleading reviews.  Maybe I just caught this place at a bad time, but from what I experienced, the food and service were everything that my predecessor reviewers said it was not.      If you stay at the Holiday Inn, ignore the temptation to eat breakfast here.  The waitress wouldn't stop trying to sell their 13 dollar buffet breakfast that was about on par with a complimentary hotel breakfast at a Laquinta Inn.  I asked for a chocolate milk, that's right, chocolate milk, and the waitress said \"we have chocolate milk at the buffet.\"  Get over the buffet lady.   The hash browns were soggy, the coffee cost 3 dollars and wasn't even good, and the bloody mary was completely bland and cost as much as a meal.  My meal was supposed to be hashbrowns, eggs, and bacon, and they forgot the bacon.  When i confronted our mumbling non-english speaking waitress about this, she went over to the buffet and put 3 pieces of stale bacon on a plate and brought it to me.    I hope you get the picture, don't waste your time.  It's not not terrible."}
{"text":"Made reservation on-line in part due to the 10% off for special events and free parking pass.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Ordered paella and lasagna.  Flavors were not special and not as good as we expected.  The house wine was nice. Convenient location in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great bar service through the CIAA the bartender who name I failed to get as j was too involved in the hustle and bustle of the crowd and music and socializing.  She was able to work the bar, be involved with everyone take drink and food order with a smile and provide prompt service which is not something you get too often when there is a large crowd and one bartender. No one felt left out with this gem she rocked it I never been to this place but only ended up here because we had family in town staying in the Hotel. I will get back here just to get her name and add it to my review.   Though I was fasting and only had bottle water everyone else I was with enjoyed their food to the fullest including my hubby who had the chicken wrap. There was a nice simple and affordable menu at the bar which made it easy to order and socialize. My cousins had the Hot Wings and her friend had the buffet as it was filled with a lot of options that was geared toward the tournament (I Guess). I say this because the tournament draw a ton of HBCU which is majority urban so the buffet included fried chicken, friend fish, collard greens, corn bread, etc. you get the drift. I don't believe this place sell that type of food on a regular BUT maybe I'm wrong as I'll definitely go back to see and if so I'll update my review and give them another star as I'm going with 3 for now."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the service and appetizers were excellent. We came here for the Club Blume cocktail hour before Kinky Boots and we had a great time! They all validate for lunch and dinner!! Make sure you come check them out!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  I was surprised at how good it was for a hotel restaurant .   Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Empty restaurant should have been a clue. And when they did not acknowledge my open table reservation, thus losing my points for dining...this was going down the road of disaster.  Disappointment. Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"There's nothing special here for me. The menu isn't extensive but offers some pastas, salads and sandwiches.   I ordered the black bean burger with fries. It comes on pita bread and is topped with lettuce, carrots and a feta spread.   It was fine. Like I said nothing special and I don't think I'd order it again. Actually, I don't think I'd come back only because there are too many other options in the area.   Either way, I'm glad I tried it. And I appreciated the 15% off for checking in."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner and breakfast here. This restaurant is part of the Holiday Inn. I had steak shrimp and lobster mac and cheese. The steak was cooked really well and was good quality meat. The shrimp was kinda tough and the mac and cheese was just ok. The servers was really nice and attentive that night. The breakfast buffet was really good because it is located in the hotel lol. The breakfast buffet as not the best quality foods but it sure wasn't the worst and the fact that I didn't have to leave the hotel to get some food made the slight overpriced breakfast buffet worth my money. I will be skipping the overpriced dinner here but I will be eating breakfast here every time I stay due to convenience and the food is just not that bad."}
{"text":"Walked by Cafe Siena for 4 years before I heard that they do relatively cheap buffets for lunch. I've only been here once on a Wednesday for their Mexican buffet. Was told to get in before 12 so as to beat the crowd and so we did... was seated immediately as we entered the cafe.  Everyone seemed to load up on the soft tacos which were great. I had more than enough beef and shrimp tacos... lets just say I didn't do much work after lunch. :)  I have to stop by on other week days to check out their Italian and International buffet lunches."}
{"text":"I recently stayed in Charlotte in the Holiday Inn above Caffe Siena.  Consequently I found myself eating there for most meals (my reason for being in town, taking place in the hotel.)  The staff and food at Caffe Siena to be fresh and delicious.  Oh -- wait!  The food was fresh and delicious!  The staff wasn't fresh at all... they were gracious and professional at all times!    The bruschetta was lovely -- 3 large grilled toasts brushed with EVOO; each with a different topping: fresh tuna, grilled eggplant and smoked salmon... the plate drizzled with balsamic reduction that incited visions of plate-licking.  This became my go-to dish, as it allowed me (if I wanted to) opt out of having all the bread.  Paired with a salad of mixed greens and fresh mozzarella, I couldn't have been happier.  Their tangy dressings were excellent as was the wine selection.  I'll be back, Caffe Siena -- if I'm ever in Charlotte again!     Note -- the price range I selected was based on my experience.  Appetizer + salad typically -- or, breakfast."}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Siena for lunch with a few colleagues of mine. Our server was very attentive and pleasant. I got the hummus veggie wrap and it was good. I also got the crab soup and was not disappointed one bit. The portions are large. They also have a salad bar and make your own pasta bar at lunch sometimes. It wasn't over the moon amazing but it was definitively a solid choice and I will go back."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter went after church and the ambiance was absolutely beautiful! It was very classy and clean! Amy, the waitress there greeted me, told me to sit wherever I wanted and suggested lovely menu options. I decided on a large salad which was served with plenty of dressing just like I had requested. My daughter had something from the kids menu. The amount of food for me and her was as refreshing as the taste of it. Amy and a gentleman who I assume was the manager of the resteraunt were very sweet. I do plan to come back another time because the price was much lower than I expected."}
{"text":"I will start with the food it was amazing from the waiter to management  i was there 8/23/15 and the supervisor came over and asked how was everthing amd talked to me about  things in charlotte from sports to family  i will be back"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the exceptional lunch buffet at Cafe Siena and the salad bar is really becoming a favorite of many uptown lunch goers. I like that they have a different selection each day. Maybe italian one day, then the next Asian favorites. But I must say my favorite is the seafood gumbo with the huge shrimp served with the rice pilaf. Even though the lunch time can be quite busy the waiters and waitresses they I have gotten always seem to be quite attentive. For am all you can eat buffet I think the price is quite reasonable. I always enjoy my dining experience. Oh, and let me mention it would be nice if they offered a daily dessert with the exception of the banana pudding that should be served every day. It is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"The place reeks of burnt cooking oil. I went for breakfast. I ordered the one egg option with a fruit bowl. the fruit was obviously not fresh and looked gross. Waiters are nice but service is very slow. I would never go there again due to the smell of the place which made me sick and the food quality is poor."}
{"text":"Dined in for dinner before a concert at the Spectrum Center. They were full with reservations at all tables but we appreciated that they were allowing people to sit and order at the bar because Uptown was so crazy at the time.   The food was pretty average as it comes. I ordered the pasta bowl which was slightly cold and ribboned pasta which I don't really like as far as styles of pasta goes. My friend ordered the black bean burger which was really good but kind of difficult to eat as it didn't come with a bun.  I don't think I would come back here to eat but it convenient and filled our hungry stomachs."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Restaurant Week meal I've had to date. I'm 23 and have the palate of a child so it's rare that I turn my nose up to a filet mignon and macaroni and cheese. This meal was extremely low quality, not fresh, and potentially microwaved.   First course Tuna Salad - avocado was browning and lettuce was browning.   Second course Filet Mignon/shrimp/Mac and cheese - I've NEVER had to salt and pepper an entree at a nice restaurant but it had to have been the blandest meal.....and let's not even get me started on the sides. Potentially Stouffer's Mac and cheese straight from the microwave and very questionable shrimp.    Dessert tiramisu - clearly was cut straight from the box from wherever it was ordered from.   I DO NOT recommend this restaurant whatsoever, coming from a young adult who's favorite restaurant is Outback Steakhouse. Please save yourself the trip and the money."}
{"text":"Cafe Siena has been around forever.  It's a solid lunch choice offering a menu of sandwiches and salads or a daily lunch buffet.  I would recommend the buffet as it includes green leaf salad, pasta salad, fruit and a daily theme:  Monday - Create Your Own Pasta Tuesday - Southern Comfort Wednesday - Fiesta Latina Thursday - Mad Italian Friday - Big Easy Cajun  I've never gone for dinner, but I have visited the bar area a few times and the specialty drinks are pretty good."}
{"text":"I visited during restaurant week and while the food was good, the drinks were so-so and the restaurant was about 1,000 degrees.  We tried the (award winning) sea bass cake, eggplant napoleon, she crab soup, sea bass entree (which I understand is on their regular menu and is fantastic), and filet. The one negative on the entrees was the flavorless julienne vegetables with the entrees, but I am guessing those were just for restaurant week? I would hope. Desserts of lavender creme brulee (though more than a little burnt) and raspberry cheesecake were good.  We tried a few cocktails, none of which were great. A simple cocktail (vodka/soda with a splash of grapefruit) took about 15 minutes to receive and because of the heat, all the ice was just about melted once it made it to the table.   Overall, the food was good and service was fine, but I can't imagine why they didn't notice sweaty diners and do something about it before we mentioned something at dessert."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday, the place was empty.  I also had to walk into the attached hotel to go to the bathroom which I found really annoying.  The menu had alot of great options but the food was just okay.   For my main dish I got the salmon which arrived cold but was overall was good.  However, it didn't have much flavor so I had to use alot of salt.   The calamari was really crunchy but should have come with an aoili sauce.  This also arrived really cold.  However, my friend's really liked the French Onion soup and lobster ravioli and the waiter was really sweet.     I would try this place again if someone wanted to go, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"So backstory, I stayed in the hotel for several rainy nights so we went there 3 different times.   The good: Amy the bartender is phenomenal, she knows the area and offers great suggestions. I'd highly recommend the short rib flatbread, it was delicious.  Our service all 4 days was awesome, Luis is hilarious. The hotel provides coupons (we didn't use them, see comment below about entree) and they have daily drink specials. We had the calamari one night and it was good as well. The duck sliders are also good. Don't miss the white sangria. The wings are well prepared, but stick to the traditional buffalo, trust me.   The bad: Coconut Red Curry wings..., don't, just don't. Want to decide if they're for you?  If your spice cabinet contains more than salt packets stolen from your neighborhood McDonald's just don't do it.   Unless you like to play make believe with food i.e. pretending there something is flavorful when it taste like air, just skip it.   It literally tastes as though someone made a cream sauce and just added cream, no salt, no seasonings or herbs, just cream.  I love curries, Indian, Caribbean, it doesn't matter. One thing they all have in common, flavor. My colleague described it best as \"milk toast.\"  The entree options are limited and nothing seemed to be very appealing, so we stuck to appetizers and breakfast."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast there and I had the buffet. They had the eggs, bacon, potatos, bread, orange juice, hash browns. So overall I was impressed considering it was the Holiday Inn restaurant. The service was good, I was great as soon as I showed up downstairs and they took care of me with orange juice as well as water.  You got your breakfast and fruits right downstairs from where you are staying and its very convenient. I personally liked it and I recommend you taking advantage of the good services that the hotel provides."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an amazing meal during Restaurant week. Service was friendly and efficient. Omg hot fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic dip. We both had the fillet mignon and it was tender and cooked to perfection. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"There are few times when you find the perfect place to relax and grab a drink. This is that place!!  Arlina and the rest of the staff were amazing!  Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The two stars I'm giving is only because the food was not too bad. We went here before the Ed Sheeran concert tonight. We had a 5:00 reservation. Everything was fine until business started picking up around the time we got our food. After our meal arrived it was about 40 minutes before we saw our server again. In her defense, the restaurant was packed and there were only 3 servers. The hostess had to wait tables to try to keep up. We finally got our server's attention to ask for the dessert menu. She brought it to us and disappeared for another 20 minutes. We finally placed our dessert order and then waited another 20 minutes for it. We waited a while for the check and finally the hostess brought it. She comped our desserts because of the wait, which we appreciated.   The food was so-so. Nothing to write home about. I had the spanakopita and grilled asparagus and it was good. My friend enjoyed her black bean burger. The Black Forest cake and the Lemon tart were acceptable.   I really think that if the restaurant wasn't severely understaffed it would have been a more enjoyable experience. I'm glad we decided to make an early reservation because otherwise we would have missed our show! We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to have a nice quite luncheon. We saw the menu posted outside the restaurant and was sold when we saw crepes posted. Three women walked out of the restaurant and asked if the food was good. They shook their head and said yes.  Looked at yelp before and it posted Mediterranean Cuisine. Got confused with the types of foods being served.  So here is the scoop. The restaurant is right next to Holiday Inn. Many of the hotel guest come downstairs for breakfast and other meals.  There is a lunch buffet served everyday and with a different theme. It was Italian on Thursdays. We wanted the crepes and also ordered the BBQ sandwich with fries on the side.  So here is the food review.  Shrimp crepe was good with nice chunks of shrimp. There was also scallop and salmon too.  The BBQ sandwich was not to my liking. Yes, I have been spoiled by the other BBQ sandwiches that I have tasted in the past. It was like a spread with finely shredded pieces. There were some BBQ meat pieces which was rough to chew and swallow.   As for the dessert- The tiramisu was good with a cup of cappuccino. My friend went for the Nutella crepe. It had lots of whip cream in the middle with a scoop of chocolate ice cream in the middle of the plate.  Food is okay."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here it was a quiet night and we felt taken care of. I had the angus burger which has crisp bacon on it, and an order of calamari. The calamari was different but really good with a little more citrus taste tan I'm used to... the burger was perfect I asked for rare and it was seasoned perfectly the bun wasn't your typical hamburger bun it was full of flavor no idea what it was but it was great! The fries were scrumptious! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a coworker's farewell lunch. When I was looking at the reviews beforehand, and I didn't see anyone write about ordering the salmon, but figured I'd take the chance and see how it was. Holy cow delicious. I highly recommend it. It melts in your mouth. Then we ordered the crepe dessert. It has Hazelnut spread with strawberries and vanilla ice cream. If you like Nutella, this is the dessert for you. I made sure I ate every bite. Overall it was a great experience, I do wish they have the lobster and cheese available at lunch though."}
{"text":"decided to come here for charlotte restaurant week. i was throughly impressed!!! i had the steak a friend had the duck and another friend had the sea bass. everyone enjoyed their meal. the only complaint is how small the venue is but this particular night it wasnt crowed so it was not a problem for me at all. if you are going to go make sure you park in the holiday inn parking garage where they will validate. i wish i had known this prior. this is a very nice place. great food. great service."}
{"text":"Admittedly, Shauna and I were at Caffe Siena together for restaurant week and we usually have very similar opinions on food/service so I apologize for any overlap.  The quick and dirty review - food was exceptional, service was mediocre and the environment was uncomfortably warm and lackluster (though not terrible).  As my appetizer I ordered the baked eggplant - and wow - I almost wish I could have ordered it for dinner.  It was a generous portion stuffed with fresh mozzarella and a light tomato sauce.  I honestly thought nothing would outshine this starter but the sea bass was a flaky, tender and flavorful delight.  It was topped with thinly sliced vegetables and sat on a bed of potato gratin topped with a most delicious lobster sauce.  For dessert I tried to be \"good\" and ordered the mango-berry sorbet.  I did indeed get sorbet. And it did indeed taste like mango-berry.  Not much more I can say on that.    As for the service, our waiter was very sweet but the timing of our experience was not very good.  Our reservation was for 8 PM and we didn't leave the restaurant until nearly 10 PM.  We also sat with finished entree plates for a notable length of time.    Perhaps my biggest complaint was the temperature.  If you have not been to Caffe Siena before, the kitchen is viewable from the restaurant.  It's a large cut-out in the wall and the prepared food is actually placed on a visible counter for the servers to pick up.  Now anytime you decide to combine the kitchen and the dining room it's super important that the heat coming off the kitchen is tempered by a solid A/C system.  I'm not sure what was going on but the front door of the restaurant was propped open, the ovens were going full force and by the end of dinner some of us were sweating. The smell that came out of the kitchen also permeated into the dining room so it smelled like I was standing over the frying pan for most of the night.  My clothes also smelled after leaving. If you've ever worked for a restaurant before, you'll know what I'm talking about!  If Caffe Siena could match their ambiance and service to their food, I'd be a recurring customer - no doubt."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow.  I was the only person in the restaurant besides the people at the bar and it took them forever to prepare my burger and fries. My cocktail came out with hair dangling from the glass.  Needless to say, when I am in the Charlotte area again I will not be returning here nor can I recommend it to my friends and relatives. The only good that came out of this meal was the 15% off I received for checking in"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Caffe Siena last night. Food was ok, but nothing spectacular and the service was pretty bad.   I had the cannelloni as my app. The chicken in it was dry, not enough ricotta and it was just ok. I had the steak, shrimp and lobster mac for my entree. Steak was great, cooked to perfection. The lobster mac was just ok. I have had way better. It was a bit dry and lacked flavor. For the dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake which was very good.  Our service was incredibly slow. It took forever to get drinks out and the waitress was very inattentive. The most annoying part to me was when I put cash and my card to pay. If you didn't know what I wanted to do with it the girl should have asked. She charged everything on my card when I wanted her to put the difference on the card. I was super annoyed about that.  Due to the lackluster food and the service, I definitely won't be going back here."}
{"text":"I had an amazing dinner at Cafe Siena. The food was delicious. I ordered the filet and grilled shrimp. The service was excellent and the prices are very reasonable. I would highly recommend eating at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Caffe Siena for Restaurant Week since it had such a varied selection on the Prix Fix menu and all of the choices sounded good.  We had an early reservation (5pm) so the restaurant was practically empty when we arrived, but filled up quickly as we were dining.  We were seated alongside a window, which was perfect for people-watching, and were at the end of the aisle leading to the outdoor seating, so we didn't have to deal with people walking by a lot.  (Too hot for anyone to want to eat outdoors right now.)   We didn't bother with the wine or beer list, so I can't rate that.  My friend was pleasantly surprised to find out that they offer fountain Coke Zero and I just had iced tea.  Our server Angel was very good at her job, was knowledgeable about the menu and was even willing to get a sample of the sauce used on one of the main entrées for my friend so she could decide if she wanted to order it or not.  I ordered the Moroccan Lamb Slider with homemade chips as an appetizer - be warned that the menu says \"sliders\", giving the impression there's more than one but that's a typo on the menu.  The slider was good but it didn't blow me away with flavor.  My friend ordered the Florida Rock Shrimp and Marinated Vegetable Salad and she enjoyed it, but she didn't rave about it.   I had the Peppered Filet Mignon with Shrimp and Scallops as an entrée and it was wonderful!  The lobster macaroni and cheese just got better with each bite (needed a little salt), the steak was cooked perfectly (med-rare), the scallops and shrimp were very flavorful and the asparagus was cooked perfectly to me.  My friend decided to get the Basil Crusted Chilean Sea Bass after tasting the sauce they use on it - she doesn't like fennel and was pleased that the sauce didn't overwhelm the fish.  She didn't clean her plate (like I did), but she was saving room for dessert.   She got the Nutella Crepe with ice cream and loved every bite of it, while I tried the Caramel Apple Cannoli.  I found the diced cinnamon apples and small blob of whipped cream a wonderful addition to the 2 mini-cannoli on the plate.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable dining experience for my first visit - I wouldn't hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"We had Goatcheese app, Squash soup, and Duck sliders, just a quick bite and it was all very solid.   We enjoyed it were very surprised it was 830pm and we wanted something quick this was awesome.   Will go back!"}
{"text":"Fist and foremost, my sincerest apologies to anyone who was at Caffe Siena last night, and witnessed the loudness of our table. We were 13 ladies having too much fun, and there isn't such thing, right?! We had large table at the back, and I didn't feel that Caffe Siena's staff were annoyed our loudness, they were really patient and kind, yet very slow (because of our big group?)  I personally had the Short Rib Pappardelle, which was okay, just okay, and it didn't impress me. However, here are the things I've learned about Caffe Siena that I'd like to point out: - It's considered a Mediterranean Fusion. - Weekdays express lunch Buffet specials: Monday: Create Your Own Pasta. Tuesday: Southern Comfort. Wednesday: Fiesta Latina. Thursday: Mad Italian. Friday: Big Easy Cajun. P.S: Don't forget to ask about their frequent diner card to earn a free lunch. - Daily drink specials: Monday:  $5 Local Craft Beer and Infused Martinis. Tuesday:  $4 Miller Lite / $6 Jim Beam. Wednesday:  $4 Sam Adams / $6 Finlandia. Thursday: $4 Yuengling / $6 Signature Cocktails. Friday:  $4 Coors Light / $6 Jack Daniel's. All Weekend: $3 Mimosas / $4 Bartender's Beer Special / $6 Jalapeño Infused Bloody Marys. Sunday through Thursday: Half Price Appetizers from 4pm - 6:30pm. - Going to an event at Blumenthal Performing Arts? Show your ticket and get a 15% off your check with purchase of an entrée and free parking. -Concert? You are also in luck. You'll get 10% off your check with purchase of an entrée and free parking with event ticket! - No concert? No show? No need to get pouty. Yelp you covered with 15% for checking in. I got it. Yay- Yelp life ;)   Now with the friendly service, and all of this specials, I prob won't go back. Three Solid Yelps"}
{"text":"Not to be a negative Nancy (for those nanc-ily-named ladies, no offense) but I was not impressed.  We arrived early for our reservation (not needed) and were seated.  The waitress came up with the typical... \"may I get you fellers some drinks\" and we were well on our way to a great evening.  After about 5 minutes or so, she returned to ask if we would like to order, knowing that we were waiting on the rest of our party.  I thought it was interesting that she would ask that...  and by interesting, I mean sufficiently awkward.  How do you respond to that anyway?  \"Oh, yes, I'll have the special and when our friends arrive you can get their order when you bring us our food\"   Second... for the price, the food was just ok...  Steak and shrimp, means, steak and two shrimp...  It was cute...  something I would expect from the kiddie menu...  The pasta that I ordered was ok...  swimming in oil and other than some EVOO there wasn't much flavor to the overcooked penne.    The desserts were proportionately small and the tiramisu was dry, dry, dry! Finally... the check comes around and the currency exchange takes place... Naturally, the group we were with began conversation only to be interrupted by the waitress to ask if we were done signing the credit slips!  I honestly can't believe that we were asked that!  The other couple of (non yelpers) still hadn't signed there slip!!!   So, Caffe Siena, I'm not a fan.... sorry :(("}
{"text":"Located in the Holiday Day Inn uptown, Cafe Sienna provides a pretty diverse menu and has the service to match.  I've been here twice and was please with each visit.  My most recent visit was during Charlotte Restaurant Week; it's been a while and I can't remember what I ordered, but I'm confident I enjoyed it.  If you happen to be walking uptown and don't feel likely battling the noise in the EpiCenter, go here."}
{"text":"I am visiting from NJ spending some time in Charlotte for the week.   were given the wrong menus at first (simple mistake seeing it was 4pm). We were immediately corrected by our lovely waitress, Autumn! We told her what we liked and her recommendations were SPOT ON. The eggplant appetizer was so incredible, we ordered a second. The prices were so moderately priced, I was shocked that our plates were so FRESH!  So all in all, really great food for relatively cheap prices. Sweet and helpful staff, and great drink specials. Thank you, Cafe Sienna!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick bit before traveling and this was perfect! Not busy at 10am on a Sunday! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went for restaurant week, and I would not have put this on the list for restaurant week. The food is overpriced for what we ate. She had the She Crab Soup (which was amazing), the grilled filet and shrimp (which did not have much flavor, the asparagus was the best part, and the mac and cheese was meh), and the lavender crème brulee (tasted interesting at first, but in the end was great). I had the lamb slider (delicious, and their fries were actually seasoned), the blackened salmon which was placed on top of a salad (it was alright, but I only could taste fish, and no seasoning on it. The cucumber salad was all but that, it was mainly lettuce with a few cucumbers), and lastly the Caramel Apple Cannoli (they were small, but they tasted great, it comes with caramel drizzling with cinnamon apples, so it isn't like the actual thing is a caramel apple, even though the taste is pretty close). The waiting staff did not seem to care about paying attention to their customers, and that caused an unhappy experience. I would not recommend this place outside of restaurant week because I have a feeling the prices will be too much for the experience you will get,"}
{"text":"The dinner group ended up here this week and it was a truly wonderful experience.    We had hoped for a bigger group but unfortunately we only had 6 due to last minute cancellations.  The folks at Caffe Siena still put us in a private room with a huge table that could easily fit 16.    The atmosphere was nice with soft lighting around and art on a few of the walls.  Our server was Jenna who was amazing.    We received 2 complementary appetizers..a Mediterranean combo which was wonderful, especially the tapanade and we also received calamari which some people said tasted great.   After that we each ordered our own apps which some people opted for the lobster mac and cheese, the Sea Bass cake and the Ahi Tuna.  My personal favorites were the sea bass cake and the Ahi Tuna.    For an entree, I went with the Pork Tenderloin which was recommended by Jenna.  Great joice.  The pork was very tender.  It was served with asparagus and a corn risotto.  I am not a fan of asparagus but ate it here and it was tender.   All in all a good experience.  The only flaws I can see here is the lack of local selections on the beer menu and the water glasses are entirely too small.  I felt like they should have left the pitcher."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a lunch buffet uptown this isn't a bad place to stop in and check out.  They have a different style buffet for each day of the week.  I think Monday's and Friday's is pasta which I have never had.  Tuesday thru Thursday consists of Country, Mexican, and Italian buffets.    I've had the Country, Mexican, and Italian and by far the Italian is my favorite.  It's your typical buffet style food and it's pretty good but not over the top.  Although I will say that the Chicken Piccata on the Italian buffet on Thursday's is awesome!  I think the buffet's typically run $10.95 which includes your drink.    All in all not a bad buffet if your looking for a hardy lunch uptown!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect because a lot of the reviews were pretty lackluster. Overall I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by my experience:   Service- Luis ( I believe was his name) was a soft-spoken man who needed a little  lesson in confidence but overall was kind and did an ok job. He brought me a sample of wine which was nice, though I had to ask for the wine list, and we had some pacing issues with the service.   Atmosphere- Very casual and a bit outdated...you could easily tell it was a Holiday Inn restaurant. We walked in and noticed it was smoky (something burned earlier) and they had all the doors open so combined with the open kitchen area it was a bit stuffy/hot in there.   Food- I enjoyed my tuna appetizer and my filet was absolutely delicious as it was seasoned and cooked perfectly..The dessert was a disappointment, a COLD nutella crepe lacking gooeyness...boo.     The pacing of the meal was off,  we arrived at 8pm to a fairly empty restaurant and we did not leave until almost 10. I know some meals take a couple hours, but we sat breadless (though the bread was delicious when it arrived)  for the first half hour and our dessert sat on the table for a bit. Food took a long time to prepare - we noticed this from the open kitchen   Caffe Siena earns a solid 3.5 (the food being the primary star earner in this case). Since food trumps all, I'd be glad to return here."}
{"text":"The hotel gave me a coupon for a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree when I checked in on Sunday. It wasn't late but I was too tired from my flight to venture out and look for a restaurant so I stopped by Caffe Siena before retiring for the night. The restaurant was small and it was not busy at all. There were a few people sitting at the bar and only one table occupied when I got in. There was no hostess but the bartender noticed me as soon as I walked in. I took a seat at the bar but the bar is too high for me to be comfortable. Yes, I am short! So I took a seat over by the window. It was nice and I was able to people watch.   My server Donald, came a few minutes later and filled my glass before rushing off to do something else. He came back a few minutes later and offered some suggestions on appetizers and entrees. I was eyeing the sea bass cake and was glad to hear it was his favorite dish. I ordered it and was pleased. It was a tad dry but the coleslaw that it was served on top of made up for it. It was nicely balanced. Had this not been free, I am not sure I would have ordered it for $12 a piece. It was a very small portion.  For dinner it was a toss up between the lobster ravioli and the sea bass. I know. I know. I love sea bass. What can I say? However, I didn't order either of the two. Apparently, the ravioli is not made fresh in house. They order it outside but make the sauce. I already had the sea bass cake so I decided not to do that twice in one night. Donald advised that the evening special was a 12 ounce ribeye for $22. That sold me. Not only do I love sea bass but I also love a good ribeye steak. The steak was pretty big for me so I had to take over half of it home. The steak was served with a fresh mix of green beans, broccoli and carrots on top of some mashed potatoes. the mashed potatoes were chunky and garlicky. That's how I make mine at home so I really liked it. I liked how the vegetables were not overcooked and still retained their crunch. The steak, on the other hand, was a little overcooked and got more salty with every bite. I ordered my steak medium rare and it was well at best.   I want to come back and try their lavender creme brulee with some after dinner coffee."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for anything that has to do with lobster. I originally tried their lobster mac and cheese at the taste of Charlotte and my taste buds needed more. So I went to Caffe Sienna and ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the sea bass cake. Let me tell you both were unreal delicious. Definitely will be returning before I head back to the Midwest."}
{"text":"Really good food and very affordable! Service was quick and friendly. The grilled wedge salad was to die for! And the angus burger was fantastic! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a long day for some desert. Me and my wife had tiramisu and the NY cheesecake and some coffee, cute quiet place with good service and a nice bar, would definitely gonna back!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner at Cafe Sienna on Sunday night and, yet again, found a great place to eat in Uptown Charlotte. We were surprised to have the place almost all to ourselves, but then again, it was a Sunday night and it was rainy.   We loved the ambiance here - from the outside I can see how it might be mistaken for a high priced snooty place, as a previous reviewer pointed out, and just like him, we were mistaken - it was laid back and affordable! We were very happy with the menu, which offers a great selection of antipasti, soup/salads, and entrees, which range from chicken, veal, shrimp, pasta, and fish. We ordered the portabello for an app, along with the mussels. The mussels were the largest I have ever seen! (see pic). And they were delicious. The portabello was very good and my only complaint here is that there wasn't enough of it between my fiancee and I. One thing I wasn't too happy with: the bread they bring you when you sit down. It's sliced bread, like sandwich bread! Not even toasted or anything, just a few pieces from a loaf you buy at your local grocery store. Maybe it was just because it was a Sunday, but we thought that was pretty weird. But once we tasted the appetizers we didn't even notice the bread anymore anyway.   The service here was excellent, everything was brought to us on time and our server knew the menu and made great recommendations.   For my entree, I ordered the shrimp with pesto over angel hair pasta - this dish alone is a 5 star dish! It was just enough, not too thick to make you feel sick after, just the perfect blend of shrimp, pesto, cheese and pasta - amazing! My fiancee ordered the filet mignon with the crab meat over it. He was happy with it, although he did say the filet was pretty mediocre, and then if it didn't have the crabmeat on top it wouldn't have been anything special. But regardless, both dishes were very good and we both agreed we will totally be going back! It's on our list of places to take family members when they visit."}
{"text":"We went there for NYE dinner.  The surf and turf was excellent. The service was fast and friendly. They have a 20% coupon for checking in that the manager says is rarely used.  With the coupon, the prices are fair and worth the trip."}
{"text":"Went here for appetizers with friends last week. The sea bass cake and slaw is awesome!!Ordered 2.  They are $10 each-but at the end of both I was stuffed as if I ate a full meal.  Calamari was good not too bready, very light, and crispy.  Very large portions for the calamari. Also has the trio dip(artichoke,crab and shrimp, corn dip)-very good and again good size portion.  Inside is very nice, we got good service...probably because we were the only customers on a Thursday night(go figure)."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this restaurant for restaurant week on a Thursday evening.   We got there on time for our seating at 8:15pm and was sat immediately.  First thing I noticed, was the restaurant was fairly empty which isn't a good sign that the restaurant is amazing.  Second, the room was slightly chilly, possibly from being sat near the windows.  Our water we got had a slight after taste.  The first course we got were the calamari dish and the the duck sliders.   Both weren't anything spectacular.  The calamari was crunchy and cold and the duck sliders were dry and came in Hawaiian rolls.  For our entree, I got the NY strip and my girlfriend got the Short Rib Pappardelle.  Both dishes tasted OK and nothing spectacular.  For our dessert, I got the triple chocolate cake and she got the tiramisu which wasn't her first option since they ran out of Caramel Crème Brûlée. Both were small dishes.  Overall, this restaurant wasn't anything spectacular and it was OK given that it was $35/pp which personally I didn't believe the food was worth that much.  I was expecting a bit more flavor and taste and I would've expected them to put their best food forward especially on restaurant week.  The service was OK as well.    Honestly, this would be my first and last time coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Thomas and Andrew are the best wait staff I have ever had the plessure to meet. Good food and great staff, can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night and the place was dead, should have been a sign. They said they had large parties so no specials and limited menu. No sure where those parties were at as they never showed. Might have been 3-4 tables full the entire time. The service was ok. We kept having to ask for my husbands wine multiple times. It wasn't busy that the server should have forgotten anything. The food was less than average. Caesar salad had brown lettuce in it. Got the chorizo penne and it was red sauce with chunks of chorizo. It really didn't go together taste wise and overall was not very good. Ya don't see my self returning."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch before, but really enjoyed today's visit. I kept it simple and ordered the Carolina Burger with fries. It was delicious and the service (server Andrew) was great. If you are dining uptown, I definitely recommend you check this place out.   I need to come after work and try out the bar area..looks well stocked!"}
{"text":"While I was staying in the Holiday Inn Charlotte Center City, I decided to try the restaurant because it was located inside of the hotel.   I sit at the bar and ordered she crab soup for my appetizer the soup was very fresh, the crabmeat was creamy and sherry with was delicious! This soup was very flavorful and full of crab. Exactly how I love it! The appetizer was so delicious that I could have licked the bowl, too bad that I still have manners.   For my main course, I ate the Angus Beef Filet Mignon and Grilled Shrimp and 8 oz. Oven roasted filet served with asparagus, lobster macaroni and cheese and a roasted shallot sauce with a side of French Fries. The filet was perfectly cooked medium (please see the picture), with a great taste, very tender and juicy, just the way I like it, the grilled shrimp tasted fresh and delicious.     The staff and managers were very friendly, attentive and pleasant.   Ps. make sure to use the 20% off from yelp; this is a great discount that a lot of restaurant says that is not good anymore, but over here you still can use it."}
{"text":"$11 ish Buffet is small. We came on Latin Wednesday and the quality was sub par. Refried beans and rice were vegetarian (a plus) but tasteless. Tortillas were not skillet warmed, more like nuked. Guacamole was good but suspect it was wholly guacamole brand. Jicama and black bean salad was a good call. Warning 20% gratuity for parties 6 or more EVEN if everyone ate a buffet and served themselves their own food. Won't be back. Uptown has plenty of better spots."}
{"text":"Met coworkers for breakfast while in town on business. I'm not a big breakfast eater & I guess I didn't think we would actually stay for a full meal. I got a coffee and bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was toasted enough but left the inside of the bagel soft. I was disappointed with the coffee. I had such a cappuccino high from the day before at Not Just Coffee (), but this cup of joe seemed to have more water than coffee in the cup to me.   I would give them another shot for lunch or an afternoon snack, but it would not be my first choice to stop in for coffee."}
{"text":"Seafood risotto, delicious. Looks underwhelming but it's so good and creamy. Black forest cake not so much."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the Frutti di Mare: possibly the best I've had anywhere. For the price, it's the best deal on the menu. Love it!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience SO much that I downloaded the Yelp app JUST to write this review.  I attended dinner here last night due to Restaurant Week here in Charlotte, and it was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long while.   The host, though was busy on the phone upon my arrival, assured me that I would be tended to, which I was. My table was a decent location (I dined alone) & my server was a sweetheart.   My courses were as followed. 1st: Award-Winning Sea Bass Cake (Worthy of its name. Light & tender) 2nd: 8oz Filet Mignon, Large Shrimp, Lobster Mac n' Cheese, & Steamed Asparagus (Everything tasted as good ON my lips as it did leaving my lips as I talked about the meal all night. Lobster Mac could have used more Lobster to stand up to its name. I paired with a glass of Cabernet; $6)  3rd: Lavender Crème Brûlée (My. God. So light & airy. It literally felt like a dream I did not want to wake up from.)    For $40, I think it was a steal! Of course, being Restaurant Week, prices were discounted. On a normal day, though, their prices are still amazing."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and both times the service has been great. The first time we came, I brought my then-girlfriend a few years ago and she had lamb slider for an appetizer, followed by duck noisette with apples and bacon, and finished it off with creme brulee. I order their award-winning sea bass cake as an appetizer, and that was honestly the only disappointment... Not because it was bad, if was amazing... But the portion was very small. I followed that with filet mignon with lobster mac-n-cheese, shrimp and asparagus. I finished it with tarimisu  cake. This time, I brought my now-fiance and she got the sea bass cake for an appetizer while I got she-crab soup (LOTS of crab). We both got what I ordered the first time and we both finished it off with creme brulee. The food was just as good the first time, though not plated as well. We live over an hour away, and it's definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Jolene and Ed took great care of us! Great food, good service, fantastic team environment."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Holiday Inn in Charlotte City Centre and Cafe Siena was the restaurant on-site.    We went to make dinner reservation and asked about breakfast and the manager gave us a free appetizer for dinner.  We ordered some appys - lobster mac & cheese, mediteranean dips, calamari, and a seafood pasta but with a white wine garlic sauce.  Quite good.  We liked all that we ordered.  Good service at dinner.  Breakfast buffet is $14.95/person.  Includes juice, coffee, fruits, yogurt, cottage cheese, biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, waffles, french toast, and made-to-order omelettes. Not bad.  Service was a little sketch here but it's OK."}
{"text":"This is a fun gem in the city. It's built into the Holiday Inn Center City--but is located right on College with street access.  The restaurant is great, big space with a big bar in the middle. They offer a menu OR a buffet option. The buffet is built around a theme for each day of the week. I ordered from the menu, which offered plenty of options. I chose the Cesar salad with grilled chicken. It was really great, it is presented in a deconstructed format which was both aesthetically pleasing as well as tasty. Normally a Cesar is covered in dressing--this had just enough along the grilled romaine hearts. Chicken was grilled perfectly.  I will definitely be back--location is great in the heart of the city!"}
{"text":"Wow - Superb customer service!  We walked in and were seated immediately - our server Amy was delightful and very accommodating - food was tasty - our glasses were never empty - the manager came to check on us - everything was wonderful!   Best Tip about this place: If you're seeing a show at blumenthal theatre, they add a discount to your tab!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here with a group of friends Saturday night for restaurant week and although we've walked past the restaurant several times this was our first visit here.   We were the first to arrive out of our party so we ordered drinks at the bar. It took FOREVER. One glass of wine and a whiskey cocktail should not take very long to make. Our party sat down and received water in the time it took my boyfriend to get our drinks and close out the bar tab. There were probably three other people at the bar.  We ordered our appetizers, entree, and dessert at the same time which is fine. Makes things go more smoothly during the busy times of restaurant week. I got the mozzarella caprese salad, braised beef short rib and the tiramisu for my dessert. My boyfriend ordered the she crab soup, roasted duck with Apple cider and foie grassland the raspberry cheesecake. My short ribs were good..extremely tender. But let's be honest, I ordered it because it came with mashed potatoes. The entree was good, not amazing. My boyfriend's she-crab soup was probably the best thing I had next to our desserts.   Overall, it was an okay restaurant. Our waiter was nice and the kitchen was very quick about our dinner. My only complaint is that they had a problem with fruit flies. They were a few flying around us during dinner. Pretty annoying."}
