{"text":"Still rest as ever.  Same great food st the new ( any only) location at Campbell and 16th Str.  In a sea of change this place never disappoints me since the 70's st Christown Mall.  Can't go wrong with the Pastrami with Swiss on Onion roll."}
{"text":"I am one of the not so \"rare\" anymore born and raised in Phoenix, Az.  My favorite place to eat has always been the Miracle Mile.  This is one of those places where I always vow to try something new, but upon entering-go right for my favorite (the pastrami on french).   Other family members swear by the \"straw'.  I have been eating here for 30+ yrs. and the product has NEVER changed.  Truly amazing!  My husband, from New York City, loves this deli and says it reminds him of home.   A huge thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Not a Deli person, I found myself eating here with some very Deli people, who wolfed down some good looking sandwiches. They seemed more than satisfied. The food is authentic.  I opted for a burger & fries & a brownie. Yum-o on the brownie. The burger was nice & the service was excellent. Easy access if you're in a wheelchair/power chair."}
{"text":"I've eaten the hot brisket of beef sandwiches on onion rolls at Miracle Mile for over thirty years. I no longer live in Phoenix but I must visit every vacation usually more than once. I first ate at Chris-Town and then Park Central and then Arrowhead and now Colonade. The brisket is as good today as it was in 1980.  I know the corned beef, pastrami and egg salad are equally excellent but I order the brisket nearly every time...I've never had brisket at any other deli that even comes close to being as good. The fries are always great too. The bread pudding is my fave dessert but be prepared to split it or take it home, its huge."}
{"text":"Best deli i have ever been to! Have been a loyal foodie fan since it's inception at the old christown mall. The newer location Rocks. Great food & Prices. The busers are awesome- you feel like you are being waited on by top notch servers and they arent even servers! just because its a deli doesnt mean the service experience is underrated.Please TIp  these awesome servers- they deserve it! It is my moms favorite deli also....we will continue to be loyal foodie fans of this awesome deli.FYI- Best Rueben Samy i have ever had!"}
{"text":"Ate here as a kid when it was at Park Central Mall.  The sandwiches are just as good at this Collonade location.  I like the beef brisket and the fries are always yummy.  It's just good, warm, comfort food...a nice deli sandwich.  The guys behind the counter are always friendly and parking and seating is almost always available.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"We came here so my fiancé could have his fill of deli meat... I ended up having a bunch of sides and they were all crazy good. The Mac n cheese was insane. The cole slaw and potato salad were delicious. The French fries were crisp and though needing a little salt - were perfect when dipped in ketchup. I  tried a bite of the onion roll on my fiancé's sandwich and it was so delish.   Even as a vegetarian I would come back again to try other things.   Also the service was incredibly fast despite the place being packed and all the food was fresh and hot.  Plus it's right next to Last Chance. Double win."}
{"text":"Again ,awesome sandwiches, awesome service, clean, and all staff are friendly and attentive, Troy and Eric are just so nice and do an excellent job !!!"}
{"text":"Superbowl Sunday...service excellent, Eric, Troy, and Wendy always very courteous and attentive, food quality excellent, place and everything always clean!! I come from Chandler to eat here, always consistent! ! And...food looks like their pictures when served !!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for years... never fails to exceed expectations. Have fond memories of visiting this place when it was located in the old Park Central mall downtown. The location has changed but the food and people who run it have managed to keep the same amazing quality of taste and wonderful service. I wouldn't go anywhere else in AZ for a New York style deli sandwich."}
{"text":"Miracle Mile opened in my neighborhood a couple months ago so I had to go and try there lunch which I did excellent dinner breakfast all very good highly recommend this wonderful employees and very clean very modern."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheesesteak (which is made with brisket) and although it wasn't bad by any means, it was pretty average. The fact that it's also $10.99 makes it less than exciting. The fries are straight out of a 1950's hospital cafeteria. They're so bland they shouldn't be offered.  The clientele was older: probably 60-80 years old on average. The vibe is completely that of a cafeteria.  The restaurant has been around more than 50 years, and although it's sad to say it, it won't be around for another 50. This type of food, cafeteria-service, and interior is going to fade away as the generation that supported it eventually passes on. If you're under 60 and not from the east coat, this NYC Deli/Cafeteria shtick isn't going far with you. With the many sandwich options surrounding this area, I can't ever see why I'd come here again, unless it's to soak up the nostalgia for a simpler time, when food standards were less stringent and the way to order food was with a tray in hand."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than the smell, the taste, and the love of miracle mile. Being from New Jersey, trying to find a halfway decent deli on the west coast can be touch and go. My family has been dining at miracle mile at their original location since I was just a toddler, I am now 21, and come at least twice a month, and I live 40 minutes away. Nothing beats the atmosphere, standing in line for your sandwich like you do in New York. The staff remembers regulars orders, they're always friendly, and the food is always fabulous. The pastrami and corned beef are their best. Like both but can't decide ? Than my favorite, \"the combo\" is for you. Both meats on one glorious bun. I recommend the onion roll. The New Yorker is my favorite as far as pastrami goes, it's topped with coleslaw and dressing. And on that note, one final thought, their honey mustard i assume is homemade. I wish I could bottle it up and take it home."}
{"text":"Excellent New Yorker sandwich; pastrami, cole slaw and special dressing, get it one an onion roll! This is a huge sandwich, beware of afternoon naps!"}
{"text":"Best hot corned beef and pastrami sandwiches in Phoenix hands down. SO many counter choices and plenty of tasty desserts if you have room.  We've been frequent loyal customers of Miracle Mile for many years back to when they were only at the Central Ave location. The staff are top notch and always have a smile for you."}
{"text":"Love the Brisket!!! benn going to all locations in the valley for years :)"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Stay away from the burgers. Went on May 1, 2017 and ordered two Broadway burgers for lunch.  One with a side of fries and the other with coleslaw.  The bacon was overcooked, old and hard. After a few bites of the hamburger, I was getting a funny taste like the meat was going bad. I was afraid to eat anymore.  It had no sauce on it, so the taste was definitely the meat. The fries were bland,  no salt or seasoning. The coleslaw was the only thing good out of two meals. For the prices here expexted better  quality food. Service was poor. Couldn't get the order right at the counter then they brought the wrong side with each order. They were the worst hamburgers we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I was really expecting something great from this place. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. The service was quick but without any smiles (robotic). The food was less than average and nothing I would do again. The only \"miracle\" happening here is that people rate them so high. I don't get it."}
{"text":"There is only one reason for the 3 stars..and that is called the New Yorker. Do yourself a favor and go to the Miracle Mile Deli on Camelback. This one does not do it justice.  The Matzo ball soup is bland. And by bland I mean BLAND! I boxed that fucker up and gave it to my dogs.  The stuffed cabbage? Gross. Usually it tastes really good, but again I don't know what happened here. Icky. Just icky. This one just went in the trash.  The fries? Boo hiss. No salt. Zero. Zilch. Nada. And they were on the soggy side.  Overall, how to describe this Miracle Mile? B-L-A-N-D. So bland, that it would be too bland for my great grandmother. In and Out next door is a much better option than this crap."}
{"text":"Great pastrami sandwich. This place is great in more ways than one. There is plenty of parking and not a long line for a late lunch. In my opinion and my opinion only, there is no better sandwich than that, especially with a cold one on the side.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After hearing amazing things about Miracle Mile I decided to try it out for breakfast. We went in on a Saturday morning around 10:30 a.m. and there was a decent crowd but lucky for us the line was short. It took us a while to figure out what we wanted (everything sounded so good) but I decided on the omelette and my friends ordered the bagel and lox. We both ordered coffee. The staff was extremely friendly and I thought it was great that it was an open kitchen. We grabbed out coffee and our number and found a comfy booth. The entire restaurant was extremely clean.   Our food came pretty quickly and we were excited to dig in. Everything was delicious, the coffee was freshly brewed and the omelette was perfection. You could tell that everything had been prepared fresh and again the entire staff was so friendly, my coffee never got half empty without someone offering to refill it and the plates were quickly taken away once we were all finished. I absolutely recommend this place for breakfast, and I will have to try it out for lunch!"}
{"text":"Times square cheese steak is my fave at this deli.. Perfectly cooked brisket, grilled onions and peppers, pepper jack cheese served with fries and a pickle for $11.99 Make sure you have time for a wait as this place is always packed during lunch time.."}
{"text":"When you're craving that delicious food only found in Jewish delis, this satisfies for a variety of reasons. I've had most sandwiches on the menu at this point, and the turkey dinner. Everything I've had has been prepared well and served hot. Did I mention the flavor? So good! It's a huge place, so there is always seating, and the staff is incredible friendly. Every single one of them.  Get the mac & cheese as a side. Best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the \"New Yorker\" it's always the same every time you order it.. The staff has been with the company for many many years and that's good to see in the food industry.. New locations is awesome and clean.. Defiantly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to stop by this place for a while, and finally decided to do it today. I was hoping for a bigger selection of salads, but it's a 'deli,' so it can't really bother me that salads aren't their main thoroughfare. I opted for the Supreme (Turkey, Bacon and Cheddar) on wheat with lettuce, tomato and onion; I think I got Provolone instead of Cheddar but I'm not complaining. The bacon was wonderfully crispy, the turkey was thin and absolutely delicious, and the pickle (spear on the side) was cold, crispy and yummy. I got applesauce on the side instead of fries...I only took a couple bites (waaaay too full), but it's very good and it's chunky; not quite so pureed as traditional applesauce. I don't know if they have it made for them or if it's some applesauce you can buy that I wasn't aware of, but I like it. I'll definitely be back at some point, and I'll probably get the same sandwich. The servers were also very friendly; all in all it was a satisfactory visit.   **Update**  I SWEAR when I was first typing this, it had the Scottsdale address. This is in reference to the Scottsdale Promenade location; I have never been to the Camelback one.   That is all :)"}
{"text":"Brisket on a kaiser with the juices dripping onto the bread. Makes it a little hard to eat, but its yummy.  Fries are good too.  A little spendy, but all in all a good deli meal."}
{"text":"I hate to go against the popularity of this place. But I found it to be terrible. It's basically cafeteria food but not in a good way.  If you loved school lunch, military food, or ever did a stint in jail where they tried to serve a \"hot\" meal then this is the place for you!!  My wife wanted to try it so I thought I would play it safe and get a ham sandwich. I have no idea how they rang it up, but for basic ham sandwich with really high fat on the sliced cold \"holiday\" style ham, it came out to like 9 dollars.  Don't be in a hurry during lunch or dinner since it's confusing to order, and their typical customers move slow and get confused easily."}
{"text":"I've been back 2 times since I wrote the review... Both times having a great meal like the old days.  I'M BACK and enjoying it.I've had the same sandwich for twenty years and it is still great ....the New Yorker.     Barry"}
{"text":"A favorite treat to myself. The Straw sandwich here is awesome. Onion roll, hot pastrami, sauerkraut and swiss cheese. Yum. Happy and full belly now."}
{"text":"A nice, cafeteria style eating establishment in Central Phoenix/Biltmore Area.  Parking is a bit cumbersome, due to many businesses in the complex, but can't be faulted on The Miracle Mile.   Belly up to the hot line, where a 10ft steam table greets you with the specials of the day, and the standard fare. The menu has typical Jewish Deli style offerings. Big ass sandwiches made with corned beef, pastrami or my fave beef brisket. I had the \"New Yorker\" which was pastrami and slaw sloppily put between two pieces of your choice of bread. I like pumpernickel.  Add fries, complimentary pickle and a drink, it was about $10. Not to shabby. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The New Yorker at Miracle Mile Deli is simply the best Sandwich on this planet.   For those of you who are new around here, this is a pastrami on your choice of bread....think Kaiser roll, with a killer sauce and Cole slaw.   This is a must taste phoenix experience.    Great crispy never soggy fries are the bonus!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! It's huge, it's got a great big menu sure to fulfill anyone's needs.   I CAN'T wait to go back!   (Probably in between shopping 8 hrs at Last Chance)"}
{"text":"This is not a deli as the name says. More like a senior citizen tray-line food court restaurant. The cleaning solution they use for the floors smells like a nursing home/dialysis center. I would give it 1 star but their employees are very nice and their food is fresh, a bit too pricey for what it's worth.  Update in reply to Miracle Mile's response: Please change the cleaning solution you use, the smell is too strong and it smells like a nursing home. Many people have shared this with me and I'm sure you will get more business when you do. I've been there many times and gave it many chances and it was always someone mopping the floor while I'm eating there and the smell is horrible! Horrible!!!!! Yes you all take great pride in cleaning but the cleaning solution smells too strong and not pleasant almost to the point that I don't think it's healthy to be around that strong scent. I will update my review when you let us know that has changed."}
{"text":"The food was good but I just didn't like the atmosphere. It seems more like a cafeteria than a deli."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here it's clean, fast, and tastes just like I expect! I love their grilled cheese and fries and I get it 99% of the time but I have had other items and I can say nothing bad about anything I've ate from here. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there's been a couple times where it was really hot and uncomfortable inside."}
{"text":"So I just don't think that I am a deli kind of person, it is just not my thing.  Last week some of my co-workers wanted to order in lunch, and since I am still kinda the new kid, I didn't want to really voice my opinion on our selection.  After I had agreed to be the one to pick it up, they picked Miracle Mile, and I couldn't back out at this point...so I decided to just go with it.  I got the Miracle Mile Special, which was a cup of soup and half of a sandwich and a side dish.  I got the Navy Bean soup, pastrami with coleslaw on rye bread and some potato salad.  I generally love Navy Bean soup....but this was so bland and brothy, it was not anything like the Navy Bean soup I have had in the past.  There was also no ham in it....boo!  The sandwich was good I guess, but I am not really a sandwich kind girl, so I just picked at some of the meat.  I will say the potato salad was good, but not good enough to warrant a return trip.  Since it is right near my office I fear I may be suckered into going here again, and I will muddle through on those days, but I can think of about 50 other places I would rather go first!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Pastrami like myself, then this is the place for you dude. The buns are fresh and fries are pretty tasty as well. Nice option for lunch since they move folks through line rather quickly."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here today and it was very good.  His sandwich was meaty, fresh and the roll was out of this world good.   I had a Staten Island salad and could not finish it.  The romaine lettuce was crisp.  I had blue cheese on the side and wished it had been home made.   It was a little runny and no chunks of blue cheese.   But over all, a great lunch.  Love the new building.  The bus boys were really nice and polite."}
{"text":"We arrive at 11:05 am on a Sunday.  The web site listed lunch hrs. started at 11:00am.   We were told that lunch would not start for 15 to 20 minutes  The line waiting started to grow.  Finally at 11:25 am we were allowed to order.  The manager never even apologies to the waiting customers.   My lunch was sadly the driest sandwich I ever had.  I chose the walnut, grape, chicken salad on marble rye.   There was one grape and the walnuts were no were to be found.  The chicken looked like mush.  The fries were also dry and had been sitting getting cold.  I guess for the 20 minutes we were waiting.  I am going to give them another try for lunch.  The owner was so helpful in his response.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel nostalgic for my childhood, I go to Miracle Mile and order a straw sandwich on onion roll with a potato pancake and homemade apple sauce on the side.  It is a total guilty pleasure.   They've been in the Valley since 1949 and when I was a kid we used to go to the Christown location every weekend. My grandma used to always order the polish sausage  and my mom loved the hot brisket sandwich.  Even though it's not an authentic Jewish deli, it's still really good food. Other things I love here are the New Yorker sandwich and the vegetable soup.  Lots of yummy food at a good price."}
{"text":"Some of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted! Fresh, home made sides, sauces, ect. just about everything you could ask for from service to food. No doubt, it was worth every penny!   It is a great decision to go with the Turkacado and get some of their name brand sauce, with sides of Mac and cheese, with Cole slaw.  Be blessed!"}
{"text":"Wasn't in the mood for a sandwich this day, so was happy to see a nice selection of salads to choose from. Ordered a grilled chicken salad that was simply divine. Large portions of chicken served over crisp lettuce and a balsamic dressing to die for. Very yummy and satisfying lunch. A great find in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this deli because they offer quality food at a very reasonable price. It has a real East Coast feel when you walk in and the staff is super friendly. I would recommend anything on the menu and don't forget the fries!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Miracle Mile Deli! I stop in for lunch at least once every other week and have always had a great experience when I go there. Since I'm on such a tight schedule, speedy service is very important to me..and I've always been able to get in and out of Miracle Mile in under 30 minutes. The line always moves VERY quickly and the staff is always very speedy and friendly!   My favorite sandwich is their Chicken Salad..and I love their fries when I feel like indulging, but love that they have side salads and fruit to choose from too if I feel like being good :)  Their dessert is probably my favorite part, though. Their carrot cake and chocolate cake is to die for...you should all definitely try it!  P.S. Make sure to check in on Foursquare..they've got tons of great specials for those who use the application!"}
{"text":"Honestly I haven't been there but I REALLY WANT TO! Gosh look at the pictures of their food, way too good! Reading comments I see that it has a great food service (by the way, called earlier and was greeted by \"Josh\" over the phone, he was so nice and patient) and customer service as well, this is a MUST for me. Sometimes I stop going to places simply because of the service they give to their customers. Keep it that way Miracle Mile!"}
{"text":"I have been in the valley for 30 years. It is the same taste every time. Simply the best sandwich ever. The New Yorker. The staff is welcoming. Thank you for your awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"I just stop in for a quick lunch. Had the chicken noodle soup, which was nothing to write home about. Having heard rave reviews about their desserts, I thought I would try their pumpkin pie. Big mistake. Any hint of pumpkin flavor was overwhelmed by a chemical aftertaste. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Don't bother, especially if you want an order to go. The sandwiches usually come with fires or sides like coleslaw or potato salad. Unfortunately, to go sandwiches are accompanied only by a miniature dollop of slaw. Likewise, the grilled chicken salad is lettuce, chicken, 2 cherry tomatoes, and 3 slices of cucumber for the outrageous price of $9.00."}
{"text":"Best deli in Phoenix hands down! This family owned restaurant has been feeding me delightful food for my whole life. They recently opened a new location on 16th street. This building is great. Even though this is an order at the counter type of place, the staff goes way out of their way to help you. In fact their service is miles ahead of most full service restraints - miracle miles ahead! We love you guys! Then there's the food... The pastrami \"straw\" sandwich is gorgeous! Get that! Their barbecue pastrami is wonderful too. Some days they have turkey dinners with mashed potatoes and stuffing - awesome. I often enjoy a cup of their Matzo ball soup. Yummy. The kids meals come with a ticket. When your kid brings the ticket back to the counter they are given a cookie and are treated with a trinket of choice out of their toy box - fun! Everything I have ever experienced here has been perfect! Long live Miracle Mile!"}
{"text":"Experienced this place for the first time today. The wife and I split a turkey sandwich on an onion roll. $8.50 for the blandest turkey sandwich I've ever had. The swiss cheese had no flavor at all. The Tomato was practically non-existant. I could go on.  If I had to actually wait in line for this crap, I would have really been pissed, but there was no wait - at high-noon lunch time - that has to tell you something.  If you want a good sandwich, make it yourself at home before going to this rip-off deli. Or go to Safeway's deli counter and get a sandwich - they are much better, bigger and cost half as much.  I will avoid Miracle Mile Deli until I'm at least 80 - then I'll fit right in with the majority of the clientele - who have no taste buds."}
{"text":"Thanks to all the staff at Miracle Mile Deli for a successful delicious catered lunch on March 8.  The food was delivered on time, set up appropriately and abundant.  We had the cold cut plattter, lighter side platter, veggie platter and all the fixings.  My group thoroughly enjoyed the meal, as did non attending staff with the leftovers, which were plenty.  The pricing was well within our budget.  I have been asked list them as \"keepers\" for future event catering.  We'll be seeing you again!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at the Miracle Mile Delicatessens for over 45 yrs now. What makes these guys special is that the consistency is the same regardless the store or the decade. They are making the same fabulous Straw sandwiches & brisket of beef today that they were making in the 60's. Family owned & the pride shows. I'm looking forward to eating here for another 4 plus decades, God willing!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times with the last time being about 9 years ago. With that said I will say this place has definitely changed. I ate the stuffed cabbage and my wife ate the straw sandwich. The food was okay but not great as in the past. The new location on 16th street is small in comparison and parking is cramped. On busy days you will be hard pressed to get served in a timely fashion. Chances of me eating here again will be slim."}
{"text":"I have been going to Miracle Mile for years and years, and in my opinion it is still the best deli in town. Years ago, it was even better than it is now (hard to imagine), but it still has all of classics cooked to perfection.   It is hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my favorites are the daily specials. Try them if you haven't already, especially the beef stew on Tuesdays and the fish on Fridays.  There is not much else to say - if you want cafeteria style deli and you want it done right - this is the place to get it."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great sandwiches- Always love a good Pastrami sandwich! They actually have some healthy options too."}
{"text":"Plain sandwiches and too high a price. Maybe its because transplanted or formers new yorkers are used to paying 40 dollars for 3 average sized sandwiches and two fountain drinks. Maybe its the nostalgia of a delicatessen, I'm not quite sure, but this place certainly isn't what most of the reviews make it out to be. Hopefully the other menu items are better and worth the price. Staff was nice though."}
{"text":"I haven't been a regular here, only because it's not in my neighborhood. If you crave a Jewish Deli, put this one on your \"must do\" list. Their corned beef, pastrami, rye breads and wide selection of cheeses are superb. Serving is done on a cafeteria basis, just make your selections & get set to enjoy a terrific lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"The food was great but I am giving it 5 stars because of the amazingly friendly staff.  Everyone from the line servers to the cashiers to the bus boys were all smiling and super friendly.  It was wonderful.  The kids meal came with a cookie.  Rather than giving the cookie with the meal, they gave the kids a coupon for a \"cookie and prize\" that they could redeem AFTER they ate their meal.  This is brilliant.  I did not have to fight the kids to stop them from eating the cookie because it was not at the table.  They ate their meal and knew that if they did a good job eating that we would let them go redeem their coupon for the treat.  So smart."}
{"text":"I've been back to Miracle Mile at least every other week since my last review and it is always excellent.  I've branched out a bit and tried the chili dog, kosher dog with mustard and sauerkraut and the New Yorker sandwich - all are awesome but I find it hard to get anything other than the Reuben, I swear it gets better each time.  Husband tried the chicken salad sandwich and he was absolutely impressed.  Good pickles too.  I received a nice note in reply to my first review so I tried the mac and cheese again last week, it is much better than the first time so I'll keep sampling during future trips.  I also love the redesign of their website, it's much easier to navigate."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for lunch. The food is really good and it is always hard to make a choice. The macaroni and cheese is pretty wonderful."}
{"text":"This place brings me such great memories of of York, every time I stop by for my favorite sandwich. Everything thing on the menu is fantastic. If you're looking for a taste of \"New York\" in Arizona this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the finest deli in the Phoenix area.   Food is great and reasonable prices.  What more could you ask for?  A Chandler, AZ location.   Wish they'd open a place in Chandler!!"}
{"text":"The cabbage rolls are the best I've ever had.  The mac n cheese is very good, too.  The food is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"This is a great Phoenix delicatessen and one of my favorites. In fact, I always preferred Miracle Mile over many of the other deli options in the Valley. They have great corned beef and pastrami, and both are always moist and tender. The only thing that makes me do a double-take at Miracle Mile is when I am asked if I want cheese on my corned beef. Who performs that act of sacrilege? At any rate, their fries make for a nice side to their sandwiches, but I actually prefer their potato pancakes. They also have a very good matzo ball soup (although my mom's recipe is by far the best), but I don't recall them serving it on a daily basis. Another excellent choice is their split pea soup. The nice thing about Miracle Mile is that they serve a specific menu of dinner entrees for each day of the week. Try their hot turkey dinner, which is simply the best. This is a nice, casual dining place to enjoy good food, and, located on Camelback Road, it makes for easy access to the Biltmore Fashion Park or downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Reminds me of a place in Chicago called Manny's.  Although, MM is a lot cleaner.  This cafeteria style deli is the best.  I always get the Pastrami.  The corned beef is good too."}
{"text":"This place has a very good egg salad. And considering this is a deli where you order from the counter, they have good service. They refill your water, clear plates, and bring you what you need. For a reasonable price this is a good place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"You'd think I'd have gone to Miracle Mile already, considering how close I've lived to this joint for the past 18 months, but given I work nowhere near it so that I could easily drop by for lunch, and that it never seems open when I drive by it at night, my chances to eat here were slim to none.   I thought Miracle Mile was closed on the weekends, and I was going to try out the Kokopelli taqueria a few doors down instead, but as I was walking towards the latter, I saw that Miracle Mile had its tables and umbrellas out, and so I walked towards it.  Open! Score!  I walked in, and was taken aback by how mf'ing HUGE this place is. I'm serious. It's like airport hangar size. OK, maybe half the size of the Best Buy around the corner, but still.  Now comes the intimidating part - the New York Jewish deli-cafeteria-style ordering bit. It seemed like everyone who was in line knew what they wanted before they even got to the front. No stalling. No indecisiveness. It was all \"pastrami on rye with two latkes and a pickle\" and move on. Total Soup Nazi style. Any delay and you got both the people behind you and the guy behind the counter giving you the evil eye. Man, it's Sunday! What's everyone's hurry? Day of rest, people!  So I got to the front, and not wanting to waste one second, ordered the roast beef on kaiser roll. \"Hot roast beef, right?\" said the guy. I wanted cold, but said yes anyway. Did I even want roast beef? Whatever. Sandwich, fries, and pickle came to about $8.25 with tax, which seemed a little high to me - especially since all that was in the sandwich was the meat and one small dinky slice of swiss cheese.   I then took my tray, sat down, and picked up my sandwich.  Or more accurately, I tried to pick it up.  The bottom half of the kaiser roll had completely disintegrated thanks to the juices of the roast beef, and all the contents just fell through my fingers and onto the plate. Okay, so it was now a fork and knife meal. I'd have thought for $8.25 the bread would last at least a couple more minutes. My fries were lukewarm and a little limp & soggy, which was a downer. I mean, if I'm going to partake in ingesting solid cholesterol and then feeling bad about it afterwards, damn at least those fries better be hot and crispy and worth it.   In any case,  I sat around and ate my meal while lazily reading the New Times. Regardless of the sandwich malfunction and the sad fries (wah wah), it's still Sunday and I'm still going to read something, like the \"Ask A Mexican\" column on page 5 or wherever it is.  I'd say the meat of my sandwich was pretty decent (albeit sprawled on my plate and not in my hands), but beyond the kaiser roll being flimsy, it wasn't a great roll taste-wise. I was expecting a lot better, for some reason. But maybe it was because I chose my meal in a slight panic that I didn't order correctly. Who knows. There is a lot offered in terms of both hot and cold sandwiches, plus many other dishes (mac n' cheese, chicken salad, etc.), and of course, latkes. How many places do you know have latkes ready to eat? In Phoenix, anyway? But my experience here was lacking a bit, which is a bum deal, because I really wanted to like it and have it become one of my weekend institutions as well.  Miracle Mile apparently is a very popular daytime destination as it's packed to the gills during weekday lunch hour (which is crazy for me to picture every table in this humongous place being occupied). Whether I'll be back again is a good question, but at least I know in the future that my brain needs to be switched to \"on\" as soon as I step my foot in. Nothing like Grandma Ethel sighing loudly and impatiently behind you while you debate the merits of rye or sourdough in your head.   3 stars."}
{"text":"I was expecting nothing special from this place, but I will say that the sandwiches were far better than that and the mashed potatoes and fries were wonderful! Mixed with a bit of horseradish, the mashed potatoes were among the best I've had (aside from my own). The fries were fresh, golden, and crispy.  My only gripe is that the sandwich I ordered wasn't as requested, but still tasty. The cheese used was lower quality, so it didn't sit very well."}
{"text":"The best Deli in Phoenix.  This place is always crowed around lunch and is well worth the wait.  My favorite is the Pastrami and Swiss on marble rye and make sure you ask for the thousand island dressing!!!"}
{"text":"The hubby loves this place, and after tasting the pastrami, I can see why!  That said, though this place is excellent at what it does (read: I realize it's not supposed be high end eats), Phoenix in general seems to have a problem knowing what SOURDOUGH bread is.  Please do not offer it on the menu, if you are just going to supply weak white bread and call it sourdough.  It's not."}
{"text":"Miracle Mile!  This is the first time I've been here since they moved to this location.  I have been going to the old location when I first moved to the valley.  The space is a lot smaller, but the look and the feel are just the same.  It's cafeteria style and we were able to get a table.   I've never been here for dinner, but have eaten here for lunch plenty of times.  Even though I always want to try something different, I always go to..... my go to sandwich.  I usually get the straw or just pastrami with sauerkraut.  I ordered the straw and mac and cheese.  The sandwich wasn't as big as I remembered but the mac and cheese was on point!  The food was good and probably one of the better delicatessen's in the valley.  I would recommend for a good lunch, but expect to spend 10 to 15 including drink."}
{"text":"this is my favorite deli in all of AZ maybe because if there pastrami sandwich it's so dam good it has a lite smoke flavor to it super tinder and throw that on a onion roll with Swiss cheese it heaven I have and many of these other items all good but the pastrami is the best they keep it in a steamer never micro waved like some other places and there the only thing I don't like is the parking sucks at there new location so if you go at lunch expect to have a walk"}
{"text":"The matzo ball soup is bland but the corned beef and pastrami are really great!  Generous serving of meat, unlike many other local places.  Sometimes it's difficult to get them to toast or grill the sandwich though since they really try to get you through the line rapidly and they don't ask you if you'd like the sandwich served hot.  Their fries are very decent, and the dessert isn't bad either.  The interior is a little too plain cafeteria-ish and fast-food like (white, pops of color, looks cheap) but they're moving soon so I'm sure they're addressing that and the lack of younger customers.  They're slammed at lunch but they get through the line quickly.  Absolutely fantastic parking!"}
{"text":"I may be stuck in my ways....but that's a good thing at Miracle Mile. I always get the New Yorker on a kaiser roll. Corned beef and pastrami with coleslaw. Sloppy, delicious and juicy. Sometimes I get it with fries and sometimes with potato salad, but either way it's always delish.  Cafeteria style, fast service, clean, loud and busy! Just like NYC...and they have Dr. Brown's, if you know what I mean.  Just tried the bread pudding for the first time. Nothing to write home about, but still very good. Lots of raisins....  Great deli, if not the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Never would've found this place if it wasn't for Yelp.  Big, delicious sandwiches.  We bought a whole pecan pie.  I prefer pecan pie to have more pecans throughout but the flavor was pretty fantastic.  Potato salad was good and mustardy.  Cole slaw was good.  Service was excellent.  Great meal."}
{"text":"I've been eating at the Miracle Mile Deli since I can remember. Not at it's current location in Colonade but at the Cental Ave. since well.... all of  my life until the Colonade opened. Sadly Central Ave. didn't make it & there's another deli in it's location that I'm sure is fine but I can't bring myself to try it. I went to MM this weekend & ordered my usaul Turkey Straw. While it's high in calorie it's not nearly as bad as the Pastrami Straw. I have to admit I get all nostalgic and remember the days gone by. See I used to eat there with my Mom while shoping at Dillards, Goldwaters or Switzers at the now defunct Park Central Mall. I was little but the fries & pastrami my Mom passed over to me on my own plate were the best. I love the food, service & horseradish at the Miracle Mile Deli. Long live the Miracle Mile. =0)"}
{"text":"Hands down! Miracle Mile serves theeee best Hot Pastrami sandwich I've ever had in my entire life.  I order \"The Straw\" with a side of Mac and cheese and mango iced tea. My lunch date ordered \"The New Yorker\" with a side of chilli. Everything was absolutely delicious. The chili could use a bit on salt and chilli powder actually but it was still tasty.    The people working there are sooo nice. We dined in, at least 2 different people came by to ask \"How is everything\" our mouths were completely full both times so we were only able to nod and give them a thumbs up lol  Unfortunately I checked in on Yelp after I sat down and places my order so I didn't get the free side order of Mac and cheese. However, have no fear I'll definitely come back for the free Mac and cheese and this time I'll try something new"}
{"text":"Best New York style deli outside of New York. Fresh and hot pastrami and corned beef. Order your food from the hot counter and watch the cooks prep your sandwich and sides right in front of you. My only issue was during the ordering process the guys behind the counter assume everyone wants fries... Which is natural with a sandwich but they overlooked my request for two other sides and I ended up waiting for one of the guys to notice me again so that I could order them. Once they get your order the cooks move fast. So you get your meal very quickly.  The food. Okay seriously... It's all good. I ordered 'The Straw' which is freshly cut hot pastrami on an onion roll with Coleslaw and \"Miracle Mile\" sauce which roughly translates to thousand island dressing. This sandwich was BIG. Not stage deli insane big, but a really good sized sandwich. The meat was REALLY tasty. Best pastrami I've ever had outside of New York.  I used the Yelp coupon for a free mac&cheese. It was good not great. I also got a side of boiled potatoes that was actually quite good. The fries are above average.   My wife had the Turkey Club. The bread wasn't toasted, but otherwise the sandwich was very good. On the whole it was a very good dining experience.   Here's something worth noting if you expect a dingy New York style diner. This place is CLEAN. It's very well kept and modern looking. It almost feels like Epcot center... If Disney chose to have a New York Deli section in Epcot. The food is great, but the cleanliness and modern flairs threw me for a loop. I just expect New York delis to be loud and dingy. This place was quite lovely. That's both a compliment and a bit of a dig. It'd almost too nice... But I still enjoyed eating there quite a bit. The food was solidly good.   If you miss the east coast hot pastrami deli food this is the place to go in Phoenix. If you're looking for a hole in the wall deli... This is NOT that kind of place. It's very nice, well kept, and new. They also have numerous options for dessert including pies: apple, pecan, lemon meringue, chocolate moose, bread pudding, etc. Good stuff."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided we needed to check out this place since her husband and a friend of mine said it was the bomb.  Well, I would say it is closer to a water-balloon?  She had the Turkey and I had the Club, neither were great and we both complained of hard bread.  The guys in front of us confidently ordered the Hot Pastrami, which is evidently \"World Famous.\"  I'm not going to write this place off, since it's near a few good clients who I could see ordering the Hot Pastrami.  If it wasn't convenient, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Matzo ball soup!! Yummy!! Hot pastrami sandwich is great!!  Expensive but sometimes you gotta splurge!"}
{"text":"Some thing are ok here. Some things sit in the heat bins way too long and get tough. Prices are a bit high for quality of food here."}
{"text":"Met the girls for lunch at the \"new\" place. Everything was great. The food and service was on par. My one complaint was the weird parking area, who designed it?  Some bored mad architect? This is the process-always enter at the SOUTH entrance on 16th St....if you try to enter at the NORTH entrance...you will quickly remember my advice. When you leave do the reverse. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"huge line, super slow service, horrenous food and super high prices especially considering the quailty of the food, the most unfortunate thing is how many pple happily shoved this crap into their gaping maws...i mean seriously how can a place this shitty be this popular???????"}
{"text":"Grew up in Phoenix and Miiracle Mile Deli has always been a favorite! New location/stand alone building is really quite nice....bright, colorful and oh so clean! Cafeteria style still holds up well! Pastrami at this venue never disappoints! Marble rye was fresh baked! Arrived early for lunch and stayed long after the busy lunch crowd departed! Plain cheesecake was delicious and portion was ample to share! Looking forward to returning soon for dinner with wine! :-)"}
{"text":"I hate to even mention this restaurant because I'm afraid others will come and there will be lines like every other breakfast place in town! That being said, it should have props for what it does. Good prices, good food, good atmosphere. There, now don't go on Sunday mornings so there will be a cool, quiet, and delicious place for me on Sundays. ;)"}
{"text":"Was great for the last few visits. Recently, the meat selection has gotten fatty, and sub par from what it was. I ordered a pastrami sandwich, when I removed the top portion of the bread 1/8 of this sandwich had large amounts of fat trimmings. I went 1 more time later in the month, and ordered the beef brisket sandwich. Again, more than 1/8 of the meat was covered in fat.  The service is great, people are friendly, and the place is very clean, and I enjoy the other selections that this place has to offer However; it is way to expensive to be serving this type of quality!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here withRobyn N. and Rand H. I had the #1 straw  which consisted of pastrami on a bun with saurkruat and and mozzarella cheese and a potatoe pancake.well the potatoe pancake was only 3 stars and the sandwich was not bad but not as good as scotts generations. I like deli's and this one did not shine over the others I have been to."}
{"text":"The boss man took us out to lunch and choose this place. I have heard about it but never had the opportunity to try it. Well now I am hooked! Got the lunch special which is half any sandwich and two sides. I choose clam chowder and mac and cheese with a reuben. This was an enormous lunch for $9.50. Saw the line and thought ugh this is going to take forever. It didn't! It flew! One of the fastest lines I have ever seen. The have their act down to a T! My sandwich was excellent. Super excellent! Mac and Cheese very good and chowder good. The other meals my coworkers got all looked amazing as well and everyone cleared their plates. There was plenty of staff walking around clearing plates, cleaning tables and offering to refill your drinks for you. So happy to have found this gem right next to work."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place a few times already and will now write a review about it.  Once again if you are looking for a long review talking about the door knob being silver, the color of the grout in the tiles in the restroom or two birds sitting out in the patio and everything else that has nothing do with the food move on.  If you want to read something long read about valence electrons and the relationship with electricity.  Now time for the food.  It is St Patties day, so we wanted corned beef and cabbage.  I got the corned beef with potatoes only and two slices of bread.  The corned beef was really yummy too.  The potatoes were good and had a different flavour.  Plus the best part a pickle too.  I did want to have a slice of pie, but passed. The corned beef, potatoes and pickle were enough.  I like this place and recommend it to anyone.  Remember food is subjective.  Just because I love it does not mean you will."}
{"text":"Cannot get enough of the turkey New Yorker sandwich. Am totally addicted! Service is great, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"These folks are awesome!! The food is consistently excellent, the service and people rate a 10.  We have eaten at their locations for appx 20 years, and never had a bad meal or poor service.  If I have any complaint, it is that there isn't one closer to where we live!  At any rate, it is worth every mile.  Thanks, Miracle Mile owners & staff!!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best macaroni and cheese ever! The macaroni was not cooked into mush, the cheese was creamy and delicious, and it had a nice little cheese crust on top. I could have a giant bowl for a meal.  The service was very nice, but the meatloaf was mediocre. I was skeptical of the brown gravy but gave it a shot. i wasn't impressed.  Meat tasted ok, not great. The biggest sin? A lousy milkshake.  It tasted like soft serve, not real ice cream. Booooooo!"}
{"text":"Another spot where you get a ton of food. It's kinda cafeteria style as you walk through the line which was nice to see all of the food being prepared and hot in front of you. The food tastes as if they only use good quality ingredients which makes this trip much healthier for lunch than the average fast food joint. L I recommend getting the miracle mile sandwich combo which was half of a sandwich hot or cold (I got the TurkeyCran which was yummy) and two sides. I tried their fries (which were also super yummy) and the Mac and cheese. The Mac and Cheese was DELISH. It was so much food and didn't get close to finishing it all. I also took a chocolate shake to go and I was quite surprised how great that was. It wasn't too sweet so I didn't feel like I was slurping chocolate syrup. I think I'll be craving those shakes! The only negative was the parking. Show up EARLY or LATE during lunch hour or be prepared to wait for a parking spot."}
{"text":"We were out shopping and it was lunch time so we stopped in here without checking yelp. Big Mistake.  It's not that the food was awful, it's not that the service was awful. It's just that it was just \"meh\" and I'm being kind.  I had a half pastrami sandwich on rye (which was a bit dry), matzo ball soup (which was flavorless) and cole slaw (which had way too much vinegar). My wife had half corned beef on rye (the bread was dry but moistened up because the meat was fatty), a side of veggies (boiled the taste out of them) and barley/chicken soup (so-so, but tasted like canned soup).  The good news is that all of the above with two drinks was only $21. If you're in the mood for Jewish Deli - go to Chompies."}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches!  Definitely enough to share between two people.  I love their ruben sandwich on a onion roll.  The place looked clean and service was good.  It would be nice if there was a Miracle Mile in the Gilbert/Mesa/Chandler area cause N. Scottsdale is a far drive for me."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Miracle Mile pretty much my entire life.  My parents use to make it a once a week occasion, today I brought my kids and family to celebrate one of my cousins birthdays.  They never disappoint my cousin and I sat with our families together and enjoyed a New Yorker just like when we were little.  The best food and the best memories!!!! Love the new location and the same amazing food as always!!!"}
{"text":"Had the beef lasagna with steamed vegetables and some sourdough bread. All very good. Enjoyed the table service from the staff as I wouldn't expect it in this setting. The food seemed fresh even though it's served from a steam table (at least some entrées and sides are). My wife's burger was cooked to order and she enjoyed it aswell.  Long story short... It's worth a stop in for a solid deli experience with a not always traditional deli menu."}
{"text":"Great New York style deli.  The food is always great...served quickly by friendly people.  No matter how busy they are (and they're busy quite often), they're always friendly with very little wait time."}
{"text":"Okay, you just cannot beat a good deli and this place rocks. I was overwhelmed by the choices but the Rueben was calling. As you walk through he line you just point and ask and pick it up at the end. After biting into my sandwich I could understand why it was crowded. Good food and prices. Service is quick and with a smile. This is a must stop, don't waste your time at a chain."}
{"text":"Crazy Good!  This place has been making fantastic food in Phoenix since 1949 and I can't believe I just found it!  Set up as a fast casual diner, service was super friendly and quick. We were amazed at how long some of the employees have been working here.   My wife ordered \"the straw\", a classic hot pastrami with melted swiss and kraut on an onion roll. I'm not a pastrami guy but, wow that was great -- lean, juicy and packed full of smoky flavor.  I went with my favorite deli sandwich - the reuben - again a fantastic version of a classic - grilled rye, heaps of lean corned beef, swiss, kraut and just overall yummy goodness!  One knock - fries were okay nothing special but, slaw was awesome!  Sandwiches are plenty big enough to share, but you may not want too. The menu has breakfast/brunch, lunch to dinner items. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you like hot pastrami sandwiches you are going to love this place! The meat is awesome and the bread is very high quality! No small plates here! A little high price for lunch but you get what you pay for! Great place if you are dining alone with a great sitting bar area! I will go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here recently for an early dinner (and very late lunch). Not having eaten since breakfast, I was pretty hungry, and they're known for their pastrami sandwiches so I ordered the New Yorker on sourdough with ice tea to drink. Let me tell you, they do not skimp on the meat -- this is one delicious but intense sandwich. Also I'm not usually one to seek out coleslaw but it worked really well with the savory hot pastrami. I would certainly order this again ... if I can split it with someone! The mac & cheese I got as my side with the sandwich was also super tasty. Either way I'll definitely be back to try out some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Stuffed cabbage - yum! I haven't had stuffed cabbage in years and this did not disappoint!  We really liked this place and will go back again and again. It was clean, restrooms were clean, food was great and the workers were friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome service. I thought at first this place was only for old people...boy was I wrong. Freakin great food, dessert and again service. They are always clean n friendly. I am in love with there turkey sandwich. They make it exactly how I want it . Sounds crazy but sometime restaurants over due the simplest things. All I can say is if you looking for a place to grab something savory this is the place to go. Did I mention the service? Lol"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  I've been eating at the Miracle Mile delis since they opened in Phoenix.  Their new location on 16th Street is very clean & contemporary, but their BBQ pastrami sandwich was the worse I've ever eaten in my life.  I was so hungry that I ate half & took the rest home to feed to my dogs & chickens.  It was so over-cooked that it almost tasted burnt, and the sauce had no moisture left, making the over-cooked pastrami dry and chewy.  It also had a lot of gristle that was not edible.  I must have hit them on a really bad day.  I was so disappointed that I may not return & start going to Jason's Deli."}
{"text":"Exactly how a deli should be - busy, fresh, good food, good service, and clean! I wish we had a deli like this where I live, but at least I visit Phoenix often enough to get my fix."}
{"text":"Me and my parents came here on a Thursday night around 7pm. The outside was very nice-looking and brand new.  We ordered two pastrami sandwiches and one triple decker pastrami sandwich. It comes with one side each and we also ordered extra sides such as coleslaw, fruit, and Mac and cheese. The pastrami sandwich was AH-MAZ-ING! The fries are okay. The Mac and cheese is runny. The coleslaw is runny and sweet. The mixed fruit was just melon. So, the pastrami itself is delicious I just think they need to fix their side options.   The staff and customer service is awesome. They're all nice and they all picked up my dirty dishes right away. I love that!  I love Miracle Mile's pastrami sandwich. That's all I come for so I will come back when I have another hankering for it :) I still think they need to improve their side dishes, though!"}
{"text":"Well, being pretty new to Yelp, I have started jotting down places I wanted to check out. Of course, knowing their hours definitely helps. After planning on a stop at Blue Fin (which isn't open on the weekends), I ended up at Miracle Mile at Camelback Colonnade following a quick stop at Trader Joe's. I ended up being pleasantly surprised with the result, though the price was a little higher than I had hoped.  Walking in, the decor is pretty laid back; clean and open, with a dessert station right by the door (never a bad idea) and an easy path to the counter. My first time there, so I had to do the \"What do I want?\" walk through the line. Luckily, it was slow, so I was able to pick out the Combo sandwich (pastrami and corned beef). Watching them make the sandwich, you could see how thin cut the meat was, and the marble rye looked fresh (other choices include sourdough, rye, and a few types of buns). There were a multitude of options for sides (french fries, a few pasta salads, etc), but I ended up paying the extra $1 for mac&cheese. From there, it was a quick walk to the register to pay $11 for my meal, along with grabbing some free horseradish.  I took the food home, and it was worth the wait. The sandwich, which seemed a little small when the cook made it, suddenly grew to a thick mass of beef. I even had to pick off a few slices that were falling out before taking a bite. Gotta say, it was excellent. The pastrami and corned beef were a perfect match, and there was just enough fat to give it that extra burst of flavor. They give you regular mustard with the sandwich, but I preferred my own spicy mustard, with the occasional addition of horseradish (which had a good bite). The bread was perfect, and the crust broke away with every bite. Finally, the mac&cheese was a great addition. The flavor could have been stronger, but it was very cheesy and the pasta was firm without being overcooked.  Overall,  this was a pretty good find. As others noted, the price is a little steep for a deli, but you will certainly get a full stomach for around $10, so I can't complain too much. It may not be a usual stop, but it was a good find."}
{"text":"Yummy as always. A bit expensive when you come with the family though. Line usually moves pretty quickly even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Bah, this place has gone downhill IMHO.  I went to the Promenade location for lunch this week craving some good corned beef and chicken noodle soup.  Nine dollars for the combo plate (no drink as again they serve b.s. Pepsi products) and I sat down only to be disappointed in the value, and the food was kinda blah if you ask me. To their credit, my side of fries could not have been more perfect-hot, thin, crisp...just like me LOL :)"}
{"text":"\"Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?\"  \"Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile.\"  'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.  I got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager \"saved\" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. \"Why don't you like caraway?\" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, \"I really don't like the taste.\" When she asked me \"Why?\" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the \"sauce\" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that \"real\" texture. Foul, foul, foul.   Hence, the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Great place to get some tasty Deli Favorites with quick and friendly service. Conveniently located in an area where you can get some shopping done at the same time. Inside is simple yet neat and tidy. Cafeteria approach rather than ordering from the table which is nice.  Ordered The Straw Sandwich which is Hot Pastrami, melted Swiss cheese and steamy sauerkraut piled high on your favorite bread. Comes with a pickle and a side. Wife got the Half a Reuben and Soup combo with a side. They have horseradish in little cups by the register when you check out that you have to try if you like spicy which I did. Food was fresh and tasty with OK size portions.  I do have to agree that the price is a little high for what you get compared to other guys in town which is why I only go 3 stars. Look for a COUPON in the weekly mailers to help save a little dough and take it to 4. Lehayim!"}
{"text":"I trusted the reviews here and ate the pastrami. Wow!!! Great choice,big portion and very satisfying. I also recommend the kaiser roll with your menu choice. We went with a crowd and everyone was satisfied."}
{"text":"Seriously. What's the fuss over this place? Nostalgia? Because I was among the youngest patrons yesterday, and I'm pushing 40.   I met a new colleague here for a business lunch because he had just moved very close to Arrowhead. This location is right around the corner from the Mervyn's, with Macy's on the other side. It was mall food, not some awesome back-east deli. I had a roast beef. It had a decent amount of meat (but nowhere near the pic on their website), mayo, lettuce, tomato. I could have made this at home with better tasting unprocessed beef from Midwestern Meats. No option to toast the bread? I personally hate sandwiches on untoasted bread. The fries were nothing special. The wrapped cake slices were so smashed they were completely unappealing. How long have they been sitting there? The man behind the counter of the baked goods sub-section was rude and weird, but all the other staffers were pleasant. Last but not least, I felt the price was way too high. Almost $12 for a meh sandwich, fries, and a large drink? With no table service? No thanks, Miracle Mile."}
{"text":"UPDATE (4/8) - Joshua did respond and we chatted in a phone call. He basically admitted without admitting it that he doesn't use the \"best\" of the best products. He does appear to care, but he also cares about the bottom line. He admitted the chicken soup was simply a broth and that is why half of the reviews say the soup is flavorless. The corned beef and pastrami are made special for them, but not made in-house. Every big fan of these two meats knows the good stuff never ends up on a slicer - it gets cut by a knife. They only use real turkey after 4pm, etc and it goes on and on. Was offered a trip back on him, but I wouldn't know what to order, so I will just pass and hope others know that you can do way better."}
{"text":"The line moved fast. The food looked fresh. The menu is ample. The child menu is short and fare priced. The sandwiches are a lot better priced than Chompies. I had the honey-baked-ham sandwich. I know it's a Jewish deli for the most part but if you offer it make it good okay. It was alright. the ham was thin sliced and tasty, the bun however was not so good and the lettuce not so crisp. My friend had a chef salad and well it did not look very fresh either, the cheese was sort of melting back together though it had cute little cut out shapes. The lettuce not so crisp once again. The child with us seemed to enjoy the kid serving of Mac and cheese and was able to finish it. So the portion size was good for a 6 yo.  I did notice that a lot of people seemed to not eat all or any of the bread or bun their meal was on so though I'm picky, it appears to be a fair assessment that there is an issue with all the bread other than the rye.  Oh and the fact that a kids meal comes with soda is an issue, you have to pay more to give your kid a milk! That astonished me. So much for healthy America. Kid's meal comes with a cookie, French fries (yes with mac & cheese) and pop. I feel the children getting fatter reading the menu. So this Saturday lunch snatched $25 from us for a Chef salad from like two days ago, a ham sandwich on 2 day old bread and a fatten up you child kid's meal with milk and one adult small soda. Would have had a better sandwich and salad at Subway for a lot less. But I suppose if you try something else on the menu it might be worth the visit."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could ever give this amazing place less than 5 Stars.  I had the New Yorker on an onion roll and potato pancakes.  I haven't been here for years because I live so far away but it is just as amazing as ever.  The pastrami was stacked high and the sweetness of the coleslaw and Thousand Island mixed with the fresh roll is absolute perfection.  The potato pancake was crispy on the outside and full of flavor!  The Restaurant is set up cafeteria style and they keep you moving.  The service and hospitality are quick and top notch."}
{"text":"My gawd I love the Triple Decker!!! I hated when they closed the location near me. There is so much to choose from. If the other items are half as good as The Triple Decker then you will not be disappointed by anything here."}
{"text":"When I was growing up my dad would take me to Christown Mall once a week to eat here, was one of my weekly highlights as a kid/teenager. I heard someone mention miracle mile (I thought it went away like so many other businesses) and googled it, sure enough it's the same place.   You have no idea how happy it makes me that this business is still going strong and is even better than I remember! I stop here whenever I am in the area now :)"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding, the food was delicious and the place was clean. I would recommend this to family and friends."}
{"text":"What happened????? Went to lunch today and the corned beef and pastrami were tasteless. The portions are smaller......I understand why Hebrew National is not on the table as condiments anymore but it has gone WAY downhill."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a little pricey. But yah he food is very good."}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone. I had the veggie wrap while my partner had a hot dog with sauerkraut. The food was served fast, and the customer service was excellent. The huge menu would be great for a family of picky eaters. The ambience is definitely casual."}
{"text":"It had been 5 years since  I have been in one of the restaurants.  They now serve breakfast from 7.00 am to 11.00 . The price for breakfast  seems reasonable  . I came by at 11.05 and they were not ready for lunch . I had to wait for 12 minutes  before I could order a sandwich to go . Prices were about 20% higher.  But portions were large and the pastrami  very very good . The place is smaller  but much cleaner . The menu has quite a few desserts."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating in delis; I guess living in NYC and the surrounding areas for two decades has made me develop an appreciation for this genre of food. I'm glad that this deli does not disappoint. The dishes are deli staples, the servings are generous, and the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that you get - and you get the food fast because you make your choices from the already-prepared offerings in the large trays as you move through the queue.  The convenient location, bright and spacious interior, modern vibe, and friendly service all contribute to an overall pleasant and relaxed dining experience."}
{"text":"MMD has the BEST Homemade macaroni & cheese, vegetable soup and every meal comes with a pickle!!! All their dessert are to die for AND I heard on their Facebook page they sometimes have \"secret words\" and you can get a FREE dessert :)   http://www.facebook.com/miraclemiledeli"}
{"text":"My husband mentioned enjoying Miracle Mile years ago when he saw this location was being built. We were on our way home and looking for a place to have some dinner when we passed by and saw that it was open. Very nice atmosphere inside and the selection of food was wonderful. I couldn't resist the cod with yummy baked cheese and lemon topping on it  and some macaroni and cheese... all delicious! My husband enjoyed the New Yorker. He loves good pastrami and his sandwich didn't disappoint and the coleslaw side was a perfect touch. My husband had surveyed the assortment of desserts before we sat down and even though our meal was very filling we couldn't resist the chocolate cake and cherry cheesecake. Needless to say, we could barely breathe by the time we headed out to our car. With such delicious food and a wonderful, relaxing atmosphere, we'll be coming back soon... and we'll be sharing with friends and family."}
{"text":"There's a lot of comfort in the familiarity of a good deli, even if the traditional preparations aren't the most exciting. In any other context, a matzo ball soup or a brisket sandwich, piled high with no supporting players on a plain white bun, would seem boring and ordinary. In the context of a the traditional Jewish deli, it's what you came here for. You know what it's going to taste like before you even walk through the door. From this perspective, it's easy to see why Miracle Mile has become so popular - they give their customers exactly what they want."}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker it's one of the best delis for miles!  Excellent brisket, reubens, stuffed cabbage and more.  While it's a great mainstay for any occasion eat in or take out.. my biggest complaint is many holidays they are closed - so making a catering order for pickup even the day before the holiday is not possible.  Perhaps someday they can have just one person around for a late aftenoon on Christmas eve to provide simple pickup service for customers (no on the spot ordering.) In that way we can share it with family!"}
{"text":"On Sunday the place is scary slow only a couple  of  cars . I ordered  my favorite  pastrami  on an onion roll the roll was very fresh and they have great pastrami. I ordered a side salad however  they charged me for the salad when this was my side . They could not process my gift card and kept me at the register for 10 minutes  . It was not a good experience.  My family  did enjoy their  meal"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for three days on business and I visited Miracle Mile Deli three times.  I couldn't get enough!  I envy you locals!  I'd eat here constantly if I lived in Phoenix.  When you visit for the first time, unless you're a crazy person who dislikes pastrami, you order \"The Straw.\"  There's a thousand photos of it here, and, trust all of us, it's incredibly delicious.  For my other visits, I ordered their Times Square Cheesesteak.  I thought The Stack was going to be their best sandwich, but, for my money, their cheesesteak was heaven.  It comes piping hot with gooey cheese and peppers.  Try it for yourself and enjoy the bliss.  What surprised me the most about Miracle Mile is how kind and attentive the staff is.  Every time I visited, the bussers offered to refill my soda.  It took me by complete surprise.  That great service put them over the top in my book.  Next time I'm back in town, I'm going back just to explore more of the menu.  I'm sure there's tons that I'd love and didn't have the opportunity to try."}
{"text":"Ok finally checked it out for lunch today, all I can say is they have cabbage rolls !! There awesome ! Old school food nothing fancy just hearty classic stuff."}
{"text":"A Phoenix institution! My family has been going to the various locations for years, and I always enjoiy introducing new people to the great deli food. The new building is modern and pretty; the service is excellent and friendly; and the food is always comforting and delicious. This is a great place for family dinners and work lunches."}
{"text":"Not sure how I haven't reviewed Miracle Mile yet! But you guys, i've been coming here since I was a child and it just keeps getting better and better. This family owned and operated local gem is a MUST when in Phoenix. In the last few years, they've moved to a more modern space on 16th Street and Campbell. It has been in the family for generations and you can tell by the warm service and friendly faces.   They serve typical Jewish Deli fare and the portions DO NOT disappoint. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches and i'm a HUGE fan of their mac and cheese! I love their pastrami and corned beef. Both are so lean and flavorful. But the star of the show is their corned beef platter over St. Patty's Day! It comes with thinly sliced lean corned beef, cabbage, boiled potatoes, and 2 slices of rye bread with butter. SO YUM! EVERYTHING here is amazing and the food comes so quickly!   Their desserts are also delish if you have a sweet tooth. I can't wait for our next visit. Thank you Josh and team for being so hospitable and always ensuring a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"Best fresh roasted turkey in town but get there around 4-5 or its gone."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. It is usually busy but we still find a place to sit. I almost always order the NYer with pastrami on rye. Just too yummy. I have on occasion order other foods and yeah it is all good. One thing that does sort of freak me out is when I get in line and it is my turn to order the guy taking the order always alerts his co-workers to look at me and they mutter in Spanish quickly and then smile and go back to business. It has happened every time I have been to this or any other location. I know why they are looking but they are so blatant it is strange. Oh and yeah some white guys understand Spanish too."}
{"text":"The latest stop in my quest to find the best pastrami-on-rye in Valley. This place? Ew.   Some of the meat was not chewable and the cole slaw had SUGAR in it. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Following a recent trip to New York City, I had found myself craving a solid pastrami sandwich. A coworker raved about Miracle Mile when I told her, so I had it in the back of my mind going into the weekend.  I went in around 5 p.m. on a Saturday and it was pretty mellow, which was a good thing because it took more than five minutes to narrow down which sandwich I wanted to order! Come ready to make some tough decisions -- or to eat two sandwiches!  Based on a few recommendations from behind the counter, I went with The Straw -- a 6-inch-tall pile of pastrami, swiss and sauerkraut between an onion roll. Holy brined brisket -- it was delicious.  I washed it all down with a Grand Canyon Brewing Co. lager -- one of three local taps (they also had Huss from Tempe!). I lucked out, too, because I was there during \"tappy hour\" (3 to 6 p.m. every day), so my beer was only $3!  The staff were incredibly attentive. It brought the typical deli experience up a notch. Rafael, who appeared to be one of the managers, stopped by our table twice to check in. Once he found out it was our first time, he convinced us to make some room in our bulging bellies for their famous bread pudding.  Best. Gluttonous. Choice. Ever.  My date and I decided to split it, but I'll admit now that I could have totally eaten his portion once I got started! Dripping with caramel, the bread pudding managed to temporarily bump the sandwich off its tastebud pedestal. It was so, so creamy and not too sweet.  I guess as one craving was fulfilled, I won't be able to stop thinking about my newly acquired one.  In a nutshell, though: Miracle Mile definitely put me in an \"Empire State of Mind.\""}
{"text":"My first time trying the new location. The restaurant is beautiful, the service staff is Very helpful and best of all the food is fantastic.  My only complaint is that I live 30 miles away."}
{"text":"The customer service was horrendous. The cashier tried over charging us and literally argued with us that we owed money when we had already paid. Rude! Food was meh. Honestly I would have tried it again if the cashier hadn't been so rude. I even saw her roll her eyes at the other cashier as we walked away."}
{"text":"Just updating to mention that Miracle Mile has made me some great catering trays as well over the years.  Today was no different. I got a couple of large catering trays (a dessert sampler and a fruit salad) to go for a lunchtime work function.  They do offer delivery for large orders, but today I just grabbed them myself.  They were a huge hit (particularly the cheesecake and brownies).  As soon as I mentioned where I got them from my coworkers immediately talked about how much they missed Miracle Mile's old location at Arrowhead Mall.  Needless to say, both the fruit salad and desserts were polished off in record time.  Josh, you've been put on notice.  The west side wants their Miracle Mile back."}
{"text":"the best pastrami you'll find anywhere........another favorite of mine is their mac and cheese........I just wish they had a place closer to me again so I could go there more"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by since I was in the area for dinner. I decided to go with one of their staple entrees and choose the New Yorker. Which is a pastrami sandwhich topped with Cole slaw and their famous miracle like dressing. I must say it did NOT disappoint! The meat was so savory and the sandwhich as a whole was intense. It's a large entree so don't come here with a small appetite, or at least be prepared to share. I loved the flavoring and enjoyed that it came with a side (I chose fries) and a pickle.  I also really likes how quick and easy the service was. They passed the food down the line and all employees got a chance to quickly interact with me, which definitely gave it a friendly touch.  Although it was busy and full of people talking, the restaurant seemed relatively quiet and peaceful, which was very nice. I think they may have some sort of sound absorbent ceilings to help with the noise level, which I really enjoyed.  All in all, it's a great simple restaurant to come check out!"}
{"text":"Loved the huge pastrami sandwich and pleasant service here.  The potato salad was uneventful to my tastebuds though."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town to get a New York Style Pastrami Sandwich. Every time I came into town from San Diego Miracle Mile  wound be the first place I eat at."}
{"text":"Okay, a little disclaimer for bias.  Having known the family of this establishment my whole life, I can personally attest to their devotion to their food, the customers and the atmosphere.  The Garcia family first hit a home run with their original deli location at Christown Mall.  When they moved out of Christown they opened up a pair of locations with huge fanfare both at the Colonade and at Arrowhead Mall.  To be honest, I didn't think the Colonade would do all that well as they were invisible from Camelback Road.  Little did I know the following this place had.  Everytime I've gone the place has been jumping.  And rightfully so.  When you walk in you immediately notice the fun color scheme as well as how clean it looks.  The aroma from the hot line is as alluring as you'd expect.  No waiters or reservations here.  Just hop in line and order your dish from the cooks as they make it right in front of you.  My tried and true favorite is the brisket sandwich on kaiser bread with a side of fruit and a slice of one of their fresh pies to boot.  Sometimes I'll grab some pastrami or corn beef as an alternative.  They've also got burgers and kosher hot dogs if you prefer.  Other sides include chili, fries, mac and cheese, or one of a number of soups.  The food is delicious but simple.  And whatever you order, you'll feel like you're in a New York style deli (without the NY attitude of course).  So why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Well for one, this hip deli near the Biltmore area isn't cheap.  True, you get what you pay for, but I couldn't afford to eat here everyday.  A good meal here usually runs around $15 -$20 so just be aware of that.  Also, this place is wicked busy, especially during dinner.  Usually you can find a seat, but it can get pretty noisy in there.  Don't let this scare you away though.  Especially if you live in the central Phoenix area.  Alot of the folks who eat here are people from the neighborhood so its highly possible you'll run into someone you know.  If you're on the west side, their location at Arrowhead Mall won't disappoint either.    Let's give props to the folks at Miracle Mile.  This small family operation has grown by leaps and bounds over the years, but you'd never know it talking to the owners.  The same humble attention to good food, a good atmosphere, and a neighborhood following still holds strong after all these years.  Success clearly hasn't changed this family recipe."}
{"text":"We come to the miracle mile deli every time we visit Phoenix. Everything we have tried tastes really good. Corn beef, pastrami and stuffed cabbage are my favorites. I also like the potato pancakes, potato knish and Mac and Cheese. They have delicious lemon meringue pie and cheese cake. Everyone who works here is very pleasant and eager to help you. That includes the people behind the counter, the cashiers and the people who bring the tray to your table. The restaurant is always kept very clean. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. My favorite is lasagna, one of the Wednesday's items. We also had an occasion to cater from this restaurant and the results were excellent. Their choices of dessert items are excellent as well as the taste and presentation.   The staff is very friendly and attentive. The noise level is surprisingly low and moderate considering the size of dining area and the number of tables it has."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch this past weekend at the new location and this place was packed!  The service was very quick and friendly, the atmosphere was nice and the menu selection was vast.  I decided on the mac & cheese with a side of steamed veggies - all in all really good quality and a reasonable price for what you get."}
{"text":"So this place is run similar to a cafeteria. You get in line with a tray and ask for what you want to one of the line cooks on the other side. The food they serve is classic delicatessen food. You can get a delicious plate of cabbage, potatoes and corned beef for $10. They also had some great looking sandwiches, I could tell the pastrami was the hit at this place. located in Phoenix, not a bad place to stop for breakfast if your feeling like some stuffed cabbage and deli meat"}
{"text":"Great food!  Real Deli food.  Love their Pastami and Corned Beef.  I sure wish they would start carrying Gluten Free Breads for those of us that can no longer go there not being able to have Gluten.  I recommended Canyon Bakehouse breads to them so we will see.  This is the best Gluten Free bread there is. I have tried them all! Pls Miracle Mile, get the Canyon Bakehouse breads and I will frequent again.  I do not care for the other breads, only the Canyon Bakehouse.  They even have Rye!  Thanks for listening."}
{"text":"The beef brisket was WAY too salty.  The macaroni was over cooked and running off the plate.  I had a bite of pickle.  The pickle was crisp.  The pickle had class.  The pickle was perfection.  I was going to exchange the meal but I already lost my appetite. Without hesitation, mgmt offered me a monetary refund. He was a gem as were all the other chipper employees.   I left satisfied, with a smile and full of joy. Best place to come while dieting!"}
{"text":"We have frequented miracle Mile since they were at Christown  mall then colonade mall and now their newest location on 16 th St and Campbell.  New, slick smooth digs but the same friendly service with the SAME friendly people.  Imagine that, ownership that brings its people WITH when they move?  People like Gerardo who know u and remember u and Troy the manager who will help u do anything u need which would undoubtedly include cutting your meal if needed.  The food is amazing... Got to have good food AND service and they do.  Love us some Miracle Mile!"}
{"text":"I was so dissapointed that the old deli closed but was delighted to find the new one is just as good!  I had the stuffed cabbage!   It was a generous portion and very good!  It has been and will continue to be my go to stop for lunch when I'm shopping in that area!"}
{"text":"My wif'e's Pastrami sandwich was pretty good, but soup was terrible.  Soup was much better at previous location.  Just lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"I had a pastrami on rye with a salad instead of fries. The sandwich was great-piled with hot pastrami, sauerkraut and thousand island. The salad was exactly as it was billed but better than having fries. I tried some of their homemade horseradish and it was good but not as hot as they make it seem.   My only dislike? The place looked and felt just like a school cafeteria. I'd rather not revisit jr high, but this place at least had better food."}
{"text":"The best deli in Phoenix for years, my first deli lunch was Miracle Mile way back in grade school and still coming back as often as possible.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Best deli in in AZ. My favorite is the brisket of beef."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised...thought this was just another delicatessen, but this place had a really extensive menu offering something for everyone.  I just stopped in for a snack, but would like to go back and eat a full meal."}
{"text":"Love the new location but parking lot was full a testimony to the food. Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times as it is right down the street. Lunch time can be a little busy, but it is worth it. I almost always do the miracle mile special. The straw is really good and their potato salad is amazing! This is my first time coming on a Saturday and I am very impressed. It's not as busy, but still a fair number of customers. I was welcome by the friendly staff when picking out my meal. The service was amazing since I walked in with multiple people coming around to ask if I needed anything, always saying it was their pleasure. I overheard what I thought to be a manager talking to two customers in the booth close to me. One of those customers was a regular and the manager knew him by name. He came around to chat with them and take suggestions on how to make this place even better. Amazing service!"}
{"text":"I want to like Miracle Mile more than we did.   The food is good, but the cafeteria style service doesn't help when you're paying $10 for a pastrami sandwich and $7 for a kosher (Hebrew National?) frank with a side of potato salad. Our total bill came in at just over $21.00. Ouch.   Don't get me wrong, the food is good. It just doesn't seem very genuine as compared to Chompie's that is three miles away for the same price.   Sorry!"}
{"text":"So I finally made it to the Miracle Mile Deli - after hearing so many things!! We turned a meeting into a lunch meeting....and closed the deal. The parking lot was full outside...so I hesitated because if I have to wait in line for food....its not happening!! But once inside, it resembled a glorified cafeteria with plenty of seating YAY!! When it comes to deli you can't be a snob to decor - my true test is a pastrami and corned beef sandwich and they clearly received the thumbs up! While they only had potato knishes.....their selection of other goodies made up for it. I will be back. =0)"}
{"text":"WOW! The food was out of this world!! And the staff was incredibly helpful, nice, and not tight on portions! Also, facility was extremely clean, and well kept! I'll definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Three Non-Inflated Truths About Miracle Mile:  First: I don't get what all hype is about this place? This really isn't that much of a deli. It's more of a Luby's meets Subway. I'm not using that as a put down, it's just the best way I can think of how to describe this place.  Second: The food isn't great, it's just pretty good. I'd been hearing people rave about this place and how it was a NY style deli. Chompie's is more NY than this place and the food is generally tastier there. I ordered a turkey sandwich on french bread with Swiss and cranberry sauce... It was okay and filled me up but it wasn't anything particularly memorable.  Third: Miracle Mile dishes out pretty solid portions. It's not too much and it's not too little. To be honest, it's probably a little more toward too much... but in a good way.  Go to Miracle Mile for a decent meal, just don't expect the Second Coming."}
{"text":"Loved it, thought it was great. Been to both the Phx and Scottsdale location.  I've read that some peeps didn't like the long line but they do make all sandwiches fresh....I didn't mind the wait (even with 2 small kids in tow). Bread and pastrami was delish. The service was fine - we went on  a Sunday, so it was rather slow...so maybe that was why we got such great service? Who knows. All I know is that we'll be back! :0)"}
{"text":"The BBQ pastrami has taken its place among my favorite sandwiches. Plenty of breads to choose from - I got the kaiser roll on my most recent visit, but I've had several different kinds before, always great. I'm not sure what makes this sandwich so good - it's just plain quality.  Fries and other side items are pretty tasty, and while I haven't tried a whole lot of different things there, most of the menu looks pretty appetizing. Since I live nearby now, I'll likely be back often to keep trying new things."}
{"text":"I will tell you that I have always been fond of Delicatessen food, but only in larger cities such as New York and Chicago.  I never really wanted to venture in here as my taste buds have rarely been satisfied with Miracle Mile's menu, regardless of whichever location I visited.  So, here we were driving north on 16th street, and my wife sees the new location, and asks if we could give the new place a try.  Reluctantly, I pulled in. The parking lot was fairly empty, especially for being this late on a Sunday Morning. A sparse parking lot, when there should be a myriad of cars present during a normal bustling period, is indicative of either bad food, bad service or perhaps even both.  Needless to say, we were both pleasantly surprised as to the overall cleanliness of the place, the wonderful servers, and the selection of the food. My wife had the Reuben, which she said was delicious, and I had the Cod. I thought it was a little on the bland side, but it really wasn't that bad at all; especially for Deli food.  Overall, it was a good dining experience, and was further validated by the fact that 15 minutes later, the lunch crowd finally arrived and filled the place up in a hurry.  There was nothing negative about our experience at this place with the food or the staff. The only negative experience we had was having to endure the rude woman customer in front of us who went off on the server for giving her the bread that came with her meal! She yells at him stating \"Why are you giving me bread? Don't you know that I can't eat that?\"  No duh! It comes with your meal, and he doesn't know that you have food allergies as he can't read your microcephalic mind! I felt sorry for him as he looked flabbergasted as if someone high-fived his face.   I did say something in his defense, and yet she proceeded on down the line without even apologizing.  Aside from that, it was a great brunch overall!"}
{"text":"Dear Josh, In response to your response, I do not consider my review of my experience a RANT, as you referred to it. It is obvious from the tone of your words (some misspelled) that you are angry and misinformed.  My choice to not be a customer is based on my treatment at your operation and nothing more, I have no agenda and am insulted that you would insinuate that I do.  If you had 7 managers on duty that day...where were they? I saw 4 employees and nothing more, where to you hide your managers? Also, if employees are trained correctly, you would never need 7 managers at one time...EVER. The fact remains that I was lured in with false information, laughed at when I requested an item and then given excuses by you for all the so called \"misunderstandings\" and you continue to do so now.  George would be ashamed! and believe me that I am sad that my experience was so terrible, but I just cannot waste my time and energy on establishments that don't meet my expectations.  Phoenix is FULL of great restaurants, and many have been around longer than yours, and have been functioning without 7 managers on duty, rude employees and misinformation. Those are the restaurants I will frequent.  Thank you again (I thanked you already) for your offer, but no thank you."}
{"text":"Miracle Mile is great for groups. It may seem like there is a long line when you walk in, but they move through the line quickly. The food is delicious and the portions are usually quite large - perfect for sharing or bringing leftovers home.  My mother-in-law loves Miracle Mile, so my father-in-law stopped in to bring a sandwich back home for her when he was in town a few months back. They wrapped up the bun and separated out the toppings so he wouldn't have a soggy sandwich when he got home. Now that's great customer service!"}
{"text":"There are some places that remind you of specific times in your life that hold a very special meaning. I had just moved to the Phoenix area from New Mexico and made friends with a very special co worker.  She introduced me to the Miracle Mike Deli and what an experience.  New York style deli food, lots of choices, great atmosphere and very, very reasonable prices. I have to admit, outside of the Pastrami on rye, cole slaw, fries and lemon meringue  pie, I'm kinda at a loss.  Tried the meat loaf, roasted turkey, cabbage rolls but always go back to the Pastrami on rye. This is a must go to place. Not open late so dinner needs to be a bit early, but damn if it's not the best lunch deal out there. Located near the Biltmore area, it's  literally off the 51 freeway and the lines go ultra quick. Don't take my word for it. Go get some great deli food at Miracle Mile."}
{"text":"Miracle Mile is a great speciality to have in Phoenix. Having a New York State of mind, I love coming here to enjoy this l cuisine since it is rare to find in these neck of the woods.  Whether it's the chicken soup with matzah balls, a delicious pastrami sandwich, corned beef, a traditional sandwich, a hot dog or a piece of cheesecake for dessert - always puts a little smile on my face. You are always going to get a good meal at Miracle Mile, definitely the best around! Haven't tried the potato knish just yet ;)  Since I cannot have my mom's chicken soup when I am sick, I make my way over here to cure any cold or cough!"}
{"text":"I love Miracle Mile! The Straw is my favorite, but you gotta add their dressing! Rueben, triple decker, and New Yorker are also awesome! Wish it was closer, but if I'm in Phoenix, this is where I eat!"}
{"text":"First went to MM as a small child in the 60's with my dad when they had one down at Park Central Mall; took my son to Christown in the 80's and now I take my grandson to Camelback.  My fav is the New Yorker-huge pile of pastrami, coleslaw and Russian dressing on a fresh onion roll, plenty for two or save for lunch the next day. My son loves their salads and my grandson loves the homemade mac n cheese with jello for dessert. I love to see places with polite employees and MM  's are great and many seem to have been around forever. You don't stay in business as long as MM unless your doing something right."}
{"text":"I had the cod and I wasn't impressed. Obviously it was frozen. It tasted very fishy and wasn't flaky. The crust on top was like gum. Never had to use a knife before to eat fish. The macaroni & cheese was average at best. Definitely not homemade tasting at all. All in all NOT worth 11 bucks! I will say that the kosher hot dogs are very good. I guess people come here for the sandwiches but that's not my thing. I wanted to try the bread pudding but it's supposed to be served warm with vanilla sauce or ice cream so theirs is obviously not fresh as it's sitting there sliced behind the glass like cake. I won't be back as to me all the hype ended up being just a tad bit better than cafeteria food"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the Miracle Mile deli since they were a hidden gem in Christown Mall. No matter the location, the food has always been hot, fresh, fast, and most importantly delicious. They are pricier than quick junk food, but you get great food for the price. This is a good restaurant to bring your visiting friends and family for a quality meal."}
{"text":"Good variety of deli-style food, big portions. Not sure about how healthy the food is - it seems a bit greasy / fatty. But there's definitely something here for everybody in your party, meat lover to vegetarian."}
{"text":"Miracle Mile Deli has a great selection of fantastic food, beer, and desert. Options range from calorie conscious to refeed, cheat meal fun! I reccomend checking out this fantastic locally owned eatery on 16th Street and Campbell this weekend."}
{"text":"Make this your next brunch stop. Lunch and dinner at Miracle Mile deli are great, and other reviewers here do a nice job covering the details of the sandwiches that stack almost as high as a solo cup. Breakfast, though? You are in for a great surprise.  First, make sure to bring friends with you. This is going to be for selfish reasons. Try to plant some ideas in their heads of what they should order, because you want to diversify the plates that come to the table so you can broaden your sampling horizons. It's going to help you decide what to get the next time you come back because you will already be planning your next time. The breakfast is *that* good.   I've had breakfast at MMD 3 times now. I went with the super nova lox and found the bagel to be just right, the lox were delicious, and the veggies on the plate were all very fresh. That made it my go-to order 2 times, but I switched it up after hearing from my dad and my husband about the Empire State burrito. Not everyone can nail chorizo, but this was spot on. The chorizo is flavorful and balances very well with the eggs and potatoes. I could have eaten it on its own, but the salsa they have on the side is clearly (and fabulously) made on the premises by someone who knows what they're doing. Often you can tell how good a restaurant is by how well they pay attention to details like this.   My son had the cinnamon roll pancakes which are pretty much dessert masquerading as breakfast. (Not that I blame him). The frosting as fantastic and the  pancakes are tasty, but that dish is jussssst edged out by the glazed banana walnut pancakes. Every bit of flavor there is fantastic, and like the salsa, the candied walnuts are another sign of that consistent attention to detail.  I should probably go for the pastrami hash next time since that's pretty much MMD's wheelhouse. At least that gives me an excuse to get back soon."}
{"text":"The Miracle Mile Deli between Camelback and Indian School on 16th Street is an attempt to bring a proper east coast Deli to the Phoenix area. They have been in business for a long time, but recently moved to their new and spacious location.  Food is served cafeteria style with a standard Deli menu. Pastrami is made in house and is a specialty. I love pastrami so I had to sample some on Rye of course. Mustard is available on the tables, so no need to request it on the sandwich.  The pastrami was very good and is probably the best available in the area. It's not quite NYC level, but good anyway. I also opted for a generous scoop of delicious potato salad and their tasty pickle spear. Everything was very good and served fast.  Miracle Mile Deli is everything you are looking for in an east coast style Deli in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"I had a pretty basic sandwich.... turkey and cheese on a kaiser roll with fries. It was pretty good I will have to admit, but $10 for a sandwich and drink definitely makes it not worth it. I would visit more often than 1 or 2 times a year if it were not so expensive. Yea, I am cheap but .... its a sandwich......."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and had the opportunity today. They did not disappoint! I jad the straw and it was delicious! I am going to try their New Yorker next trip."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Their pastrami sandwich on sour dough bread is one of the best in town."}
{"text":"Right up there with Katz's deli in NYC. Amazingly perfect pastrami on a true reuben. Excellent choice for brunch - especially since the line didn't start until noon (a \"miracle\" around here.) For any reviewers chatting about the lines/format/menus - it's likely because you've never been to a real NYC deli. This place is that, exactly. And nails it. Great work!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Miracle Mile Deli in the Camelback Colonnade shopping area for many years now. I always, always order the pastrami on sourdough with swiss cheese and onion, a side of potato salad, and a pickle. The meat portion is extremely generous; the entire meal is delicious.  They have many items to choose from so if pastrami isn't your thing, you will no doubt find an item that is.  Just writing this review makes me want to get in the car and drive over there--and that is saying a lot, since I live about an hour away.   Definitely recommend!  Update 6/2012: Made the 50-mile trek out to Miracle Mile Deli for the first time in a long time. As always, ordered my old standby--pastrami, Swiss and onion on sourdough, with a side of potato salad and a pickle--and as always, it was deeeelicious. The staff was friendly as usual, and the employee at the register thanked me for stopping in from so far away.   Wish they would open a location closer to home, but it's probably best I am not eating pastrami sandwiches every day of the week!  9/2014/: It had been a looong time, so decided to drive out there tonight for the usual. I arrived 15 minutes before closing but  they still had everything ready to serve, and were very welcoming. The sourdough bread, Swiss cheese and pastrami (with onion) were delicious, along with the pickle and the potato salad.  It will be a while before I have room to try some of the delicious-looking desert, but that's how it usually is after one of their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually don't like The whole cafeteria style situation but this place I will definitely make an exception. I LOVE there sandwich. Everything is always fresh and delicious. People that work there are very friendly and attentive. I definitely come here for lunch every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I heard about this place after they started following me on Twitter. Curious by any restaurants I find online, I totally fell in love with their menu. I had to try it!  I went on a pretty slow weekend afternoon, and was surprised by how big the place was. It's kept up nice, has lots of room inside and out to sit, and the service is extremely quick!  I ordered the \"Triple Decker\" sandwich...the name says it all. It was piled high with meat and loaded with flavor. Sometimes, sandwich places in AZ just miss the mark in flavor and end up dry & bland, but Miracle Mile definitely doesn't. They know how to make a good sandwich.  So excited to find this place...or should I say, they found me! The price? It's about as much as any other place to grab a bite to eat for lunch. Can't complain!"}
{"text":"If you like home-cooked food like Mom used to do except always on point just kidding go check that place out my favorite to get is the corned beef and cabbage but they're cabbage wraps their fish everything is completely on point there they even have Moscato and different kinds of beverages the suit everyone's needs extremely great experience to bring family and our date"}
{"text":"Literally the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had. Can't get enough of this place. I have been going to miracle mile since I was a kid, and it has always been amazing. Even the fries are good. How do they do it? Btw - get the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"11/18/16 (3 stars) I was Xcited to try this place since the location is so close to my house and the yelp reviews. I ordered the straw on an onion roll with fries and a free side of Mac & cheese. The sandwich just ok, I wouldn't order it again. The Mac and cheese was ok. I will give this place another try.  Fast service and the place is extremely clean!   12/12 (4 stars) This time I ordered the Rueben on an onion roll with fries. This time my fries were nice and hot and I definitely prefer the corn beef or the pastrami. Same friendly fast service!   So if I could I would give this place a 3 1/2 I would, but since the consistency of the service and the cleanliness  of the place I will give them 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Really thought I was going to like this place a lot more than I did. The service was really fast and friendly and the atmosphere was hopping, but that's the best I can say. I was really disappointed in the sandwiches we had. The bread was just standard store bought bread, and the meat (especially the turkey) was just gross processed yuck. Also this might be a little nit picky, but it tilts me so much when I get a sandwich and the meat is all squished up in a ball in the middle and you can tell they didn't even attempt to evenly distribute it over the bread.  So yeah, we were really disappointed given the hype MMD has. And like many others have said, for the quality, the price is WAY too high. There are a bunch of other local gourmet shops with the same prices and killer sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great dining experience.  Fast and to-the-point service in the cafeteria line.  Great food at a good price.    Amazing service.  Listing the year the staff started their on their name tag was a nice touch-- the gentleman who helped me had been there since the late 1980s... and made me an excellent sandwich with courtesy and enthusiasm.    I'll be back.  Thank you."}
{"text":"A free standing Miracle Mile- hell yes! Since the downfall of the locations I grew up with at Park Central, and ChrisTown Malls, the closing of the locations at both Arrowhead and what used to be The Colonade Mall (turned into some kind of strip mall place), I was thinking I would never again get to have a hot pastrami sandwich from a place that has been in my life since I moved to Phoenix at the age of 4 and that had been in my maternal families life since before then.  We came on a Sunday around noon after we were at the cemetery for the unveiling of my Grandmother's headstone. It was had/has been an emotional time and going to a place that had an historical place in my memory and in our family seemed somewhat appropriate. The ONLY thing that was missing was the Karsha's rye bread (Karsha's closed) and the rye bread they are using isn't quite as tasty, with the right kind of pull. The pastrami was just like all of my memories.   MM used to be a Jewish Deli and has been Jewish \"Style\" for years and years now. My husband loved his turkeyBLTA and his side knish and everyone else enjoyed what they had.   Private parking lot- and perfectly planned thick covered door handle coverings so you don't burn your hands opening the door.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"After 12 years of business at this location I am so sad to report that Miracle Mile is now closed....  Sad I am."}
{"text":"i was taken by how many options there is  so i ask the guy what's good? mile high he said  okay, mile high it is and side of mac and cheese please!  i have to say i'm picky about cold slaw on my sandwich, but this was a great combo  the dressing, the meat, and cold slaw, it was a great symphony in my mouth.  i'm not one to eat cold sandwich after couple of days, but this i will and it was still great  i can't say the same for mac n cheese, nothing but a little doctoring up cant fix that  cant wait to try the rest of menu....it's going to be awhile to try all"}
{"text":"We've been going to MM for years. It's a shame all of the other locations closed but at least you can still go here to get the awesome Pastrami Straw sandwich. This is my all time fav! I've never had anything here that I didn't like. This is my go to deli in the valley."}
{"text":"Oh Miracle Mile.. This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Super awesome deli and everyone who works there is so nice. I order something a little strange and off-menu because I'm a vegetarian, and they are always so accommodating. My boyfriend usually gets the pastrami and loves it every time. The mac and cheese is delicious and just like a deli should, you always get a free pickle!  They are moving to their new location in June which will be less then a block away from where I live, so I'm concerned that I'll be there every day. We'll see what happens. Looks like it's gonna be a cool spot though!  Stay awesome!"}
{"text":"I ate this place about a week ago and I really enjoyed the atmosphere it was very clean I liked it a lot .    I ordered the Pastrami Sandwich and it was very delicious but the down fall is there wasn't much pastrami on the sandwich, as you see in the photo the bun is huge and very little meat.   It was good food, just wasn't enough to satisfy me unfortunately. I was kinda disappointed in that left me wanted more!   Please don't let the photo fool you, it's not a lot of meat. The bun itself makes it look fuller."}
{"text":"It was great to find a New York / Jewish style Deli in the middle of Phoenix on my last trip out there.  Miracle Mile doesn't hold back on their servings and prices albeit a tad high, is well worth it.  You can't go wrong with the 3-D Sandwich Combo, it has Corned Beef, Pastrami, and Roast Beef.  Ask them to toss in some thousand island and sauerkraut.  I beleive they have multiple locations, so google or yelp them!"}
{"text":"Looking for a light lunch at Miracle Mile Delicatessen? Oy! You won't find it here!  I was stuffed fuller than the turkey on my challah ever could have been. The \"special\" is described as a 1/2 sandwich and (either side salad or) cup of soup. I had no idea it also came with French fries and a pickle wedge! The turkey was fresh and overflowing over the bread. Try it with a side of cranberry sauce for that \"Thanksgiving\" flair. The matzo ball soup was also tasty, with the flavor of homemade broth.  It had been quite a while since my last visit to Miracle Mile Delicatessen and the new decor gives it a lighter, airier feel than I remembered. But the service is just as fast  and the portions will leave you stuffed to the max!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time."}
{"text":"The new location is beautiful!   As always, the food was fresh and delicious.  The staff is always super friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling, and don't seem to hate their jobs like the staff of a lot of other places you visit.  Miracle Mile is always a treat!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Awesome service! Spotless establishment!  Have tried many of their main menu dishes and NONE have disappointed me! You WILL NOT go hungry here! Many yummy dessert choices too. The cheesecake is my fave! They even cater to the little tykes with a coupon for a free cookie and toy! So head on over there... whatcha waitin for?!"}
{"text":"Great new spot for this place! I love that I no longer have to battle the Colonade parking lot. Got a hot pastrami w swiss on an onion roll. Good flavor crust on the pastrami. Really fast service at 1pm on Thursday."}
{"text":"Exceeding Expectations.  I felt I needed to update my review on Miracle Mile Delicatessen.  After a recent posting on yelp about my dining experience at Miracle Mile I was contacted by Josh,  Business Manager at Miracle Mile.  Josh and I spoke about my dining experience and at the end of our conversation I felt great. After my convesation with Josh I now know why Miracle Mile has been in the valley for over sixty years. A philosophy of tradition, pride, excellent customer service,and great food is why Miracle Mile stands out.  Customer Service, in my opinion, means exceeding  expectations. All of us  expect a certain level of service, and some expect more than others. However,  when a business EXCEEDS those expectations, it should be acknowledged and that is exactly what Miracle Mile has done, they exceeded my expectations.     In my oponion,  that is what I call the  \"WOW\" factor.  It's not often that I find myself saying \"WOW, I didn't expect that\" or \"that was beyond what I expected\" but thanks to Josh that is exactly what happened.    THANKS, again  Josh for caring about the experience your customers have at your restaurant and a special thanks for the gift card!"}
{"text":"Went on St Patty's Day for some corned beef and cabbage (My mama be proud!).  This place was super busy, no parking could be found in the lot and we circled around the building twice...finally parking at the strip mall next door. Really good and worth the wait.  The meat was a good serving and the cabbage done just right.  Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Outstanding. I'm still lickin my chops. Had the Straw; can't go wrong with pastrami in an oniion roll with swiss cheese & sour kraut. If you haven't had the treat of a Miricle Mile Deli meal then you are missing out."}
{"text":"Have tried everything from soup, to wraps, to sandwiches and it's all been amazing! We call in for lunch orders at work and Troy and Rafael are  always awesome to work with!"}
{"text":"I've been to the MMD about half a dozen times now and each visit, it has been consistent and reliable.  It features a broad array of Jewish deli food items to more standard fare like hamburgers and mac n cheese.  Everything appears to be freshly prepared using real ingredients.  Due to the large selection and menu it may take you a minute or two to decide what you will have.  You order cafeteria style and you follow your entree down the line to soups, salads, desserts and beverages.   I've sampled their hot dogs, pastrami, macaroni and cheese, cole slaw, fries and other various menu items.  I like that they also offer a pretty good selection of beer and small personal wine bottles along with a traditional deli slate of Dr. Brown soft drinks.  If I have any complaint, it's the price.  We had a late lunch here with our teen son and nephew and for the four of us the bill was nearly $65 which is pretty high for a cafeteria.  I might expect to pay that much in NYC but at a chain restaurant in northern Scottsdale.  If you like to enjoy good old comfort food from time to time, this is a good place to go.  If you're looking for a bargain, this isn't the place, although you could always order a cup and soup, a half sandwich and a drink and probably escape for under $15."}
{"text":"I've been going to Miracle Mile for 2 decades now. the original location was on Central Ave and Earle, now on 16th St. a really fun place.to sit outside and have a tasty meal of your liking. meat loaf. lasagna, hot dogs, corned beef, pastrami. try the New Yorker, cabbage rolls, sandwiches, soups. all freshly prepared. they cater too.. cafeteria style."}
{"text":"Pretty nice deli, real assembly line to make your food, this speeds things up a bit. Pastrami isn't as good as Philippe in LA, but it was almost as good. The pretzel buns are moist and perfect compliment to the pastrami, which isn't overly fatty. Pickle, mac n cheese and potato salad rounded out my meal. It's actually enough for two people, each person half a sandwich and one side per. Save money by sharing a meal here and adding extra sides as needed. Unlock yelp code for free mac n cheese"}
{"text":"I originally walked in here and thought to myself man I bet this place is a hot place of old people in the morning..I can see the shamu wearing old ladies gathered here in the morning drinking their coffee and gabbing like little chatting Cathy dolls about the new pool boy, and the old dudes talking about their tours in Nam and the Korea and the few survivors from the big one  WW II. To say the least I did not see that but I did picture it in my mind...suffice to say it was not like that but that was my first vision:)  What's good about this place is it has plenty of space the staff seems very attentive and it is clean and the sandwiches are delicious with pretty large portions. Not huge or anything but decent. I did think it was a little pricey considering I could get a bigger better sandwich at subway for about $3.00 cheaper. This place in not bad. Run of the mill a little pricey. But would not be opposed to going here again."}
{"text":"Not sure how I have missed this place as I live 5 minutes away but stopped in today for the first time for lunch.  The restaurant is very clean and like many others have said it is cafeteria style.  You step up to the counter and they prepare you food to order.  They have a great number of different sandwiches, salads, soups and deserts to choose from.  I ordered the \"New Yorker\" Piled high with Hot Pastrami topped with homemade Cole slaw and Miracle Mile Dressing $9.79.  Sandwiches come with your choice of sides and a pickle. I cannot remember ever having better Pastrami.  Service was friendly as expected.  I will probably go back tomorrow.  :-)"}
{"text":"I came in on the Sun. before Thanksgiving and ordered 2 pies and prepaid for them. When I came in Wed to pickup the pies I also ordered 2 meals to go. Apparently I paid for the pies again without realizing it. When I came back on Saturday for breakfast I was also returning one of the pies cause it didn't taste right. These guys remembered me and handed me a gift card for the 2 pies I double paid for and refunded me for the pie we didn't like. THEN, they discounted my breakfast to boot. WHAT A GREAT PLACE!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time for a school fundraiser event. I was surprised at how friendly, clean, and what incredible food they had here! The line moved very quickly, and I wasn't rushed having my toddler with me. One of the workers asked me if I needed help to my car which I greatly appreciated. The desserts were my kids favorites. The food selection here is great, I loved the sandwiches! And the macaroni, oh my goodness, it just melted in my mouth. I can't wait to try the breakfast here!"}
{"text":"How can you not love Miracle Mile. I have been going for years! I was craving a pastrami and swiss so I knew exactly where I needed to go during lunch! I had a pastrami and swiss and fries and only ate 1/2 as the serving sizes are pretty big. It was perfect as I took the other 1/2 for lunch the next day! SCORE! Service is always great and you just can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for lunch today since I wasn't totally sure what I was wanting and knew I'd find something here. I decided on 1/2 of a pastrami sandwich with mac & cheese (it was a special today) and fries since my 1/2 of my sandwich comes with two sides. It was still a bit to much food but that's ok. Service is always great and it is always very clean. The staff is always friendly as well. Will certainly keep this spot in mind again for lunch soon."}
{"text":"I love love love this place, and it is somewhere that I get takeout from often. The \"straw\" sandwich is very tasty, with the excellent pastrami, Swiss cheese and sauerkraut--I love it on the onion bun! Their Reuben's are consistently good. A lot of the times, I just get a hot pastrami sandwich, on rye bread, and put yellow mustard on with each bite, goodness I just love it so much! Other menu items that are consistently good are their dinner specials. I love the turkey dinner which they have daily--so if you wanted, you could have a full thanksgiving dinner, nightly, and the taste is great. Just as delicious as grandmas cooking! Excellent portion size, fair price. My husband loves the stuffed cabbage dinner and gets it often. I've tried it and that's delicious as well. This place is worth your time and money! Consistently great, friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Great place with great food. I order two different meals because it was to hard to chose from. I'm glad I did. Both plates were excellent."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this place this last weekend and I had a pretty good experience. I ordered the combo which is half corned beef half pastrami with Swiss cheese on a kaiser roll. The sandwich was huge and it came with a side of your choice. Meat was flavorful and I really loved the kaiser roll, soft and a little sweet. The fries were decent and I used the Yelp check in offer for a free side of mac n cheese which was just okay. My wife got their cranberry turkey sandwich that I was not a big fan of. Way too much cranberry sauce on the sandwich and overall didn't have much flavor. We also got their bread pudding which isn't really your standard bread pudding, the texture was almost like a flan, very custard like which I wasn't mad about, it was just different. This restaurant is huge, I wasn't really expecting it to be so big so I can imagine that this place gets packed during their peak hours but was almost empty when we went on a late Saturday night. If your looking for a good pastrami sandwich I would recommend it this place. Just not sure if I would recommend much else on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't know what I'm doing here right now. I feel like this place should have died with the 80s, it's creepy alright. Had the pastrami hash $10 for an infant sized portion. I don't know how this place is even around. It's a sad weird place frozen in time. Avoid at all costs. I've done the work for you now eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. The pastrami it's amazing! I work a half an hour away from there, but will make the drive just to pick up a sandwich for lunch when I can to take back to my office. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow! Hadn't been to the new location. Very impressive. Staff was engaged, great choices, food was incredible! Leave The rotating pictures on the menu boards."}
{"text":"Went there with my boss, we met some co-workers there. I had the Combo on Onion, it was great. Service was fast. Price was average. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Nice new building and location for Miracle Mile. I had a light appetite so I ordered the chili. I know chili in July. Who does that in Arizona when its over 100 degres outside! However the chili was good. Miracle has a variety of foods to order. Like cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, salads, soups, and deserts. They even have cabbage. I was shocked to see beer and wine offered.   Funny thing though; I looked around to get a good look at the place. And I noticed it was filled with senior citizens. So I'm not sure if Miracle Mile on 16th Street and Campbell is a senior citizen hangout. Or if it was senior citizen day.   Perhaps there was a senior citizen party. Don't get me wrong I love seniors. However it was just odd to see so many in one place, at one time... On the positive side it was nice to see all types of people get out and enjoy theirself at Miracle Mile.  Recommendation: The chili I ordered was good;  however nothing to brag about. I did notice they have hefty portions of cakes:-). A decent and clean place to go if u have a light or no appeitite in particular. Since there is a variety of different foods to order."}
{"text":"Took a sick child with me to get great food! LOVE the fact they have parking and a take out window. They have every detail figured out. Love this restarant"}
{"text":"Need a quick meal for lunch?  Well Miracle Mile has your sandwich ready and on time.  I was really fascinated by how fast I got my sandwich.  They definitely had it down like a production line.   My sandwich was okay...it's nothing to rave about.  I think you could go to any small deli sandwich shop and get the same taste.  However, like I said if you're on a rush eh...go for it!"}
{"text":"I want to try EVERYTHING on the menu!!! But it's hard to do because the portions are so HUGE on everything.  I usually go with a sandwich with slaw. The coleslaw has a nice sweetness to it, but tends to be on the soggy side. The sandwiches are usually packed with meat. GREAT place for liverwurst.  This is a cafeteria-style place, so you can clearly see how fresh everything is. But the place is usually packed for lunch, so they cycle through everything relatively quickly.  The employees are always friendly and the place is always CLEAN!!! Whoever is doing the hiring there is doing an amazing job."}
{"text":"I liked it. The sandwich was big, which is great. The service was fast and friendly. The coleslaw was awesome. Looking forward to trying more from the big menu!"}
{"text":"I have updated from a 1 to a 3.  Miracle Mile contacted us and made our last visit right.  We returned and ordered some other items.  My son ordered the same.  He said his was better and he finished it this time.  I ordered mine on the onion roll which was a lot better than the wheat the first time around.  I ordered the bread pudding, I have never had it so don't have anything to compare it to but it was big and not bad.  I give a three because it was still pretty high priced for sandwiches but you do get a lot of meat."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm the area I go here. I've had the New Yorker, the Ruban, and several of the sides. The food is always fresh, and the bread is soft. They have awesome options. Best sandwiches ever! This is a must go to."}
{"text":"Like many of the reviewers, I've been coming to the Miracle Mile Deli at various locations for over 20 years.  The two things that stand out to me over that time are 1) the consistency of the food and 2) the friendly and efficient service.  This last visit I had a New Yorker pastrami sandwich on a kaiser roll with fries.  It tasted just as good as it always has in the past.  I like the shiny new building although I can see how the parking could get crowded during a busy lunch rush."}
{"text":"I've been to several of the Miracle Mile Deli locations over the years.  If you want comfort food, this is the place.  I was here today for lunch.  One of the specials on Thursdays is meatloaf and that is what I ordered.  It was a good sized portion and I had the mashed potatoes with gravy as my side.  What a yummy good stick-to-your ribs meal!  Several times the servers came around while I was eating and offered to refill my iced tea which was very nice.  I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Miracle Mile since I was a kid and it's still as good as it gets!!  Just thinking about it, Post-Straw, is making my mouth water..  New location is certainly smaller than the other locations that were around the valley, but definitely cleaner and likely a much needed upgrade for all.   Thanks for hanging in there Miracle Mile!!"}
{"text":"Best deli in town. But order to-go if ordering for lunch M-F because you're not gonna find a spot to park in anyway!"}
{"text":"From start to finish, I was totally impressed with this Miracle Mile! I was looking for a fruit plate for a large group of people. I was positive that Costco had options and ended up waiting until 24 hrs beforehand until learning that they do not.   I literally had no idea what I was going to do or where to even look. I ended up searching Google for places that had fruit platters. I was directed to Miracle Mile but at this point, about 6 pm, I figured I messed up. I believe when I called they were already closed, however, someone was still there and answered the phone. I explained the situation and explained my understanding if it was impossible to grab an order at before they even opened the next dy. The gent on the phone said \"no problem, give me a call when you're at the window and we will have your order\".  I was shocked and ecstatic! I went the following day to grab the order, I believe it was the same guy I spoke to on the phone. He was pleasant and kind and even gave me plates and napkins which I should have known to ask for but was too distracted to do so. Honestly, he made it all worthwhile and left me with the best impression of the place.  The fruit was delicious and fresh, what more could I have asked for?  Super cool. Way to go on the kick butt job!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and probably the best servers/staff of any restaurant I've been to. Great choices and gourmet sandwiches available that comes with a handful of sides and a pickle. Condiments on every table and a tray of free water at the end of the counter. All smiles around. Such a great place. I can complain about the price but I just keep coming back anyway! It's that good!"}
{"text":"Maybe I have been to too many other delis since their location closed at Arrowhead but it just didn't seem as great a deli as I had thought before.  It tasted fine, the meat was still good quality.  It doesn't seem like I got as much for my money.  Which is sort of funny as many places pile on so much meat I have to take half the sandwich in a box with me.  So in reality I got all the food I needed but it was in the same price range as many places that give you a lot more.  And speaking about pricing, I had looked at the menu posted outside the restaurant so I would not tie up the line and when I got inside the prices were higher.  I can see prices being out of date on a website but if you are going to repaint your wall menu can't you also reprint your to go menus so the one you post outside has the same pricing?"}
{"text":"I think they have some of the best corned beef around.  I have been here several times. Sometimes the line can get a bit long.  My opinion is it is a definite step up from the food court.  They may not be the best Jewish deli around but they are one of the better places to get a sandwich in the West valley.  I was in there again yesterday and got a corned beef on sourdough with potato salad ($7.95).  They tend to push their fries which are ok but I like to try different stuff.  The potato salad was ok, but I saw several of the fruit cups and wish I had gotten on of them instead.  I had more on my plate than I could finish."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to get to this new stand alone location.  All the locations I just to hit are closed:  Park Central, Christown, Arrowhead was my go to for awhile, and then the one on strip mall on Camelback.  I was so happy to see they just moved a little over.  Man, I missed my combo sandwich and those fries.  I was NOT let down.  The service is still so friendly and food is still so good.  When I was getting ready to go, one of the staff came by to ask if I wanted a refill on my ice tea before I leave.  That is super awesome since it is getting hot outside."}
{"text":"OMG! The combo is my fave! Combo is pastrami and corn beef together in harmony on bread. YUM!!    I have been coming to this Miracle Mile for tons of times..  Always love it.  It is clean, fast, and good!"}
{"text":"Always been one of my favorites and still the best! Matzo ball soup and half a brisket sandwich on Kaiser role."}
{"text":"This is one of the best deli's I have ever ate lunch at. I ordered the Miracle Mile Special with a half sandwich and two sides. I chose the Ruben with potato salad and Navy Bean Soup with Passion Fruit Iced Tea. My husband ordered the New Yorker sandwich-pastrami, cole slaw and Miracle Mile sauce on an onion roll with fries and a Pepsi. Because I checked in on Yelp and it is my first visit, I received an instant coupon for a small side of macaroni and cheese, which I passed to my husband after sampling a bite :) The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The service was outstanding with friendly and knowledgeable staff. This deli is a gem and one that everyone will love because their menu is large with a lot of offerings from cold to hot food/sandwiches.  On the weekend they have breakfast too. They also serve dinner."}
{"text":"OMG - Run..... to this place today if you see this post!! 3/17/2018. Online ordering is easy and saves the wait since today is their busiest day of the year. We ordered the corned beef and cabbage plate. Came with a HUGE pile of thin sliced corned beef that melts in your mouth. A quarter of steamed cabbage that is so tender. Irish potato's and 2 slices of original rye bread. The portions are huge, the taste completely satisfied my craving for this little Irish lovely!!! They were in the Fox 10 Kitchen this week on AZAM. Talked about the meal and made some of their specialties. Family owned, support your local NYC deli!!! In Phoenix!!! Up next for me to try is the matzah ball soup!!! Will follow up with a review!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for lunch for their corned beef and cabbage special. I was not disappointed at all. The corned beef was thinly sliced, lean, and very tender. The cabbage was cooked perfectly and the baby potatoes were so good they didn't even require butter. Our entrees came with a couple of slices of rye bread and horseradish. This place never disappoints and it is the reason it's so hard to find parking at lunchtime. One of my favorite lunchtime spots!"}
{"text":"This is my first review here but I willgo back to try a sandwich. I went in for lunch and met a couple people. I only got a soup and salad because the staff was rushing me to decide. There were way too many choices with way too much pressure. I was really looking forward to a good sandwich too :(. The soup an salad was ok but not satisfying. My boyfriend has the pulled pork and he was unsatisfied. He said and I agree that it was pure sauce and you could never tell what meat it was because of the sauce overload and because of the look of the meat. scary!!!"}
{"text":"No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile.  A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did. However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.  Yes, mold.  Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.  Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.  *ETA MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive."}
{"text":"Having been living in Phoenix since 1971, this joke of a delicatessen is a smidgen of its former self. A restaurant that doesn't have a patty melt ? what gives.  Thought I would give them a try after moving , big mistake. Never again.  In addition to very high prices with the food line staff you have to repeat yourself as they seem not to understand you.  Over 9 minutes wait for a knish that was microwaved and was ready after our meal.  The brisket for there Broadway sandwich had no taste (unless you add mustard (i didn't but my sister did)  and i shouldn't forget the meat was dryer than the dust bowl of years ago.  I see now why there is only one location it should take a hint like it's former stores and CLOSE.  I will go back when Phoenix has its next blizzard.  Save your money and do your self a favor go to Scotts Generations."}
{"text":"I've returned to miracle mile for more visits after my first visit. I wanted to comment on how much better my experiences have been since the first time. I have tried several different items and had a better 2nd corned beef experience as well. The staff gave me a leaner cut of corned beef and it was very good. Also have had delicious brisket, cheese steak, and awesome potato pancakes. The fries were very fresh and tasty. All in all it seems my first not so good experience was only a one time thing and the food quality has been very good since then. Also love the variety of sides. The Mac and cheese was very good as well. This can be a busy place and it can be tough for the service people but they are working hard to provide good service."}
{"text":"Stopped here after being indecisive in where to eat before dropping my fiancé off for school. Happened to see the sign exiting the freeway (now I know the reason why they advertise before exiting the freeway). The fiancé and I decided to order the same sandwich which was the famous New Yorker. The fiancé didn't like it as much as I did but she's not as diverse to pastrami sandwiches compared to me. Personally it wasn't bad, nothing compared to the famous pastrami sandwich at Katz Deli in NYC. But hey who am I to argue as the sandwich was savory but a little on the dry side with the Rye bread. Overall will come by and pay another visit to try there other listed sandwiches such as I am a fan of corned beef."}
{"text":"If you want a huge, delicious sandwich, this is the place to go.  They offer a ton of options.  I opted for the Liverwurst and it was delish!  Potato pancakes?  Umm, yes please!  Keep in mind that this is a true deli...you have to wait in line.  I haven't been there during a lunch or dinner rush, but they actually have \"approximate wait time\" signs up, so I'm guessing they get pretty busy!  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Had the turkacado sandwich! It was so good I forgot to take a pictures and post it. I was so wrapped up in eating it. This is a fun place with lots of selections. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pick up window was slow today. Placed order 50min in advance, and still had to wait....for big city salad mind you! There really should be a few spaces designated parking for pick up window.  Salad.was good. Cranturkey sandwhich, bleu burger? Few other things I've tried and all are good."}
{"text":"I love Sandwiches.....so I decided to stop by this joint for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I decided I was going to order the New Yorker (Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Thousand Island Dressing, on Marbled Rye) w/Fries & Pickle for $8.99.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=wYhry_TSaeyE3jlM3kqRTg To wash it down, I ordered a large drink for $2.29.  When you walk in, you get into a line like a cafeteria.  Then you place your order with someone who prepares you meal for you and then pay the cashier.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=5tUWH1ZbuhFAMnR5sYaztA It's an efficient process and it allows you to see other people's orders just in case you want to change your mind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=XQa5ffhPOJPUWHb_ULqogQ  I couldn't wait to take a bite out of my Sandwich.  The Cole Slaw comes inside the Sandwich, which I love. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=Son0jYmuPk8BM11ZBga8dA The only downside to this is that it makes the Sandwich very soggy fast as the Slaw will soak the Bread.  But that's OK with me.  I took one bite and thought the Sandwich was OK.  The flavor was pretty good, but I don't know, it wasn't great......didn't leave me wanting more.  The Fries were pretty good, but again just OK.  The Pickle was very good and was complimentary....very cool.  Overall, it was a good meal.  There are other Sandwiches on the menu that I want to try.  Return Factor - 65%"}
{"text":"07/15/07  The quintessential New York Deli...or at least what I am told one should be (having never visited New York).    Solid, satisfying, hot and cold sandwiches with a variety of potato and salad (macaroni, etc.) side options.  Cafeteria style, so know what you want by the time you get to the counter.  It's a great place to go on Sunday morning and read the paper while you enjoy a carved sandwhich.  Of course, there is nothing heathy about any of this food, but it's solidly tasty and satisfying.  Slightly pricey (hot dog special is a good economic choice), but the atmosphere is relaxing, always clean, consistent quality, and they have free self-service water, so you don't have to bother with getting back into line if you're still thirsty.    What makes it unique is its authenticity and distinction from chain and fastfood stores.  It's not particularly interesting food, just good to satisfy your deli cravings.  Plus, I believe it's locally owned with gives it actual personality.  Come on Sunday and then walk down to PetCo. (or is it Petsmart?) and visit the adoption dogs."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I used to go when they were on Bethany Home but this is so much nicer. The food if amazing and Fresh. I could eat a straw (think Rueben on an onion roll) every day of my life but then I would be 500 lbs...The potato salad reminds me of what I grew up with. Desserts are to die for. Seriously give it a try..."}
{"text":"Wowwwwwww Amazing place to say the least. Great price, service and friendliness workers. Food is fresh and tasty. Also they give Military discounts 10% off. Last but not less happy hour is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Miracle Mile is what I would call a fast food deli. You get in a line and move down the counter much like a buffet, except there are people making what you order. You then pay and find a seat or take it to go.   I ordered a hot pastrami on rye. It was just good, not great. Kind of a let down compared to the great deli shops.   The concept Miracle Mile uses isn't that great if you want great quality food put out. How can there be with a busy assembly line? There is no real quality control here.   I love deli food and have to many around town and in other states. This one just doesn't compare.   Sorry Miracle Mile, but you won't make the cut when I want my next deli fix."}
{"text":"Best pastrami sandwich in the valley. Go for the New Yorker. Enormous. Filling. Delicious. You will feel fantastic after this experience. Don't forget to get a Dr. Brown soda, also"}
{"text":"I can see why this place is busy and popular: fast service, conveient for all the business people going to lunch, and most importantly good food.   My recommendation: if it's your first time try not to go at 12:00 because the staff is busy and rushed. I had not been here before and 1 of the staff out of the 5 I encountered actually listened to what I wanted to order. I ordered a custom turkey sandwich (bacon, turkey, chipotle mayo, cheddar cheese) when the guy just started to put lettuce and mayo on my sandwich and I had to cut him off and tell him (again) what I wanted. He put regular mayo and then one of the other staff stepped in and told him I wanted chipotle mayo. I was going to let it slide and not say anything, so he ended up putting both on (which I said was fine).   The Mac and cheese was very good and fresh. The wheat bread for my sandwich was very good also. Everything tastes fabulous!   This place just needs to work on listening to their customers and not making them feel as rushed."}
{"text":"They moved a few miles away. Good food. Not cheap. No parking and had to park on the street. It's a lot smaller than the other place, but it's still a great place to visit. I'll be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time, and this place is a great addition to the neighborhood! Great food, nice atmosphere. Family friendly but also a wide variety of beer! I was not expecting beer so that was a very pleasant surprise. Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"Monday and Tuesday is beef stew special. Get it. I cannot make it as delicious as they do. Or pastrami.  Or Mac and cheese. Please make stew available more days. I would love to pick some up on the weekend once in a while. Its just that yummy."}
{"text":"I am not sure what is wrong with me, but I had never had a pastrami sandwich! Good Lord, I have been robbed. I was getting cat food at the adjacent store and tummy was rumbling so I stopped in to get a sandwich. I got the pastrami with slaw sans dressing on an onion bun with a side of mac and cheese. OMG! It was so delicious I actually called my husband at work to rave. Pastrami was super tender gratefully not completely stripped of the mandatory marbling I'm sure sets it apart from other pastrami I had historically steered clear of. Mac and cheese was the gooey traditional kind with a thick coat of cheese on top. Coleslaw was sweet, fresh, and added an extra layer of flavor to an already fantastic sandwich. Service was speedy even during lunch rush. I can't wait to try the cabbage roll but I'm going to have a difficult time foregoing that pastrami!! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and have always gotten great food. My favorite is the turkey New Yorker on marble rye. Yummy! You can choose any bread but marble rye is so good it comes with turkey, coleslaw, and dressing like a thousand island. You also receive French fries but there are other side choices and a dill pickle. Portions are a good size and they do not skimp on the meat.  Service is quick you order at the counter and your food is on a tray when you reach the register. Everyone is friendly and smiling.   They also have salads,hot dogs, soup, and entree choices such as a turkey plate or stuffed cabbage or fish if you are not in a sandwich mood. Come hungry and enjoy."}
{"text":"So you may feel like a cattle in line to get branded as you shuffle through the gated line on your approach to the bar, but it will be well worth it. You are here because you like delicatessen sandwiches. Whether its corned beef, pastrami, or one of those 'other' meats you will walk away satisfied. I usually order the New Yorker on rye bread with a potato pancake and a Dr. Browns cream soda. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Why they moved to that location beats me!! But its ok i guess, been going to this place for many years and the food is excellent but lately have ordered a sandwich and got something different! First time i ket it go but 2nd time i informed manager, i don't know if its a communication issue or what but my new idea is to wear a small harness over my head that the name of sandwich is written in black magic marker so they don't screw it up!!! But, its the best place in town to eat, real pastrami!!!!! Not fake!! Excellent food!!!!! Bar none!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered hot corned beef and wife ordered a cheeseburger at 230pm. We were the only ones in the place.  I asked to please wait to make the corned beef until the cheeseburger was ready.  Ok, no problem.   Paid the $21 and went to a table.  Within 2 minutes, the corned beef arrived.  I asked for the 2 meals to come together, young lady.  \"Don't worry, your order will be right out.\"  Fifteen minutes later, it came.  Corned beef was dry and tasteless, cheeseburger ok for eight bucks.  I agree with another review, this place is just an overpriced sandwich shop with bad service. Not sure what is special here, if anything."}
{"text":"i could eat the hot pastrami sandwich everyday for the rest of my life!  the new yorker is good too.  the fries are good.  not the best but good.  they have alot on the menu but all i order is hot pastrami and the new yorker.  any side you order is expensive.  so i never order anything.  the ambiance is loud during lunch.  i guess this is a local hot spot for lunch.  lots of seating available.  i've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"New location is smaller and so are the portions. Bring back the sandwich that you had to use two hands to eat.."}
{"text":"This is our first time at this new location, but we have eaten at the old location and the old Arrowhead mall location, so we're familiar with the  menu.  The food is always great, the service is excellent, Even had someone come by the table and offer a refill.  The place is busy, but still fast.  My only complaint is parking lot is full, it took a while to get a spot at 11:30a on Friday."}
{"text":"WOW!! Drove all the way here from Maricopa because I wanted something different, and I was bored of all the \"usual\" restaurants! Let me just say BEST DECISION EVER\"!!!! I had the Asian chicken salad! Best one I've had! So fresh! The chicken was perfectly cooked and didn't have that icky fried/burnt flavor! He had the pastrami and for someone (ME) that doesn't like pastrami it was delicious! I'd order that sandwich! Matzo Ball soup and chili were good too! Very stuffed!!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on a work day with some coworkers. The inside reminded me of a hospital or college cafeteria. It is definitely very casual and lines move very fast.  Maybe I didn't know what to order or I ordered the wrong things, but I wasn't too impressed with the food.  After staring at the menu for a while waiting in line, I decided to go for their deal of 1/2 sandwich and two sides. I ordered the hot pastrami sandwich with a side of mac n cheese and their steamed vegetables. Then I watched how my food was put together without any passion in less than 10 seconds.  The sandwich was just really ok. Nothing special. In fact, it was just bread and a lot of pastrami. There was nothing else on it. No sauce, no cabbage, nothing. As far as the sides go, the Mac n cheese was the best of the whole meal. The vegetables were broccoli and carrots and tasted like water. I didn't really enjoy this meal and actually got stomach cramps afterward.  I won't go out of my way to go there again, unless someone takes me and orders something amazing for me."}
{"text":"Oh Miracle Mile, how I love you so. The hubs and I have been coming here once or twice a week for years. The portions are massive, the counter service and bussing staff are genuine and hardworking, and the food is comforting while not leaving you feeling disgustingly stuffed."}
{"text":"The Brooklyn burger is amazing and reminds me of home New York style burger ...I came to visit from NY and the staff is so amazing. Very warm and welcoming. To top it off the food was simply amazing five stars in my books."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for awhile now, and decided to finally take the leap to try it out. My mom and I hadn't an clue what was on the menu but definitely up for trying something new Sunday afternoon.   Now I can't say I'm a fan of the winding line that lead to what reminded me of the Ikea cafeteria dishing area; I can say the food was absolutely delicious. My mother and I narrowed in on an original Pastrami w/ mustard sandwich with the shoestring fries and kosher pickle. They had to have piled on nearly half a pound of meat that was soo juicy, onto an Onion roll (which I requested, but you have a handful of bread choices to choose from). I have to add, that they have a house blueberry tea that was very refreshing and tasty as well.   I had a positive experience and plan on heading back soon to try out one of their many desserts that looks amazing, but I had no room for this visit."}
{"text":"Nice clean place and good food.  Only been there twice.  Had pastrami sandwich and Reuben.  Both were tasty."}
{"text":"Chicago needs more deli's like this. Cafeteria line and you just point at what you want. It was sensory overload for me. Lasagna, potato's, Pulled pork. I was freaking out! But I knew what I wanted. I passed by several Subways and Jimmy John's to get here. The pastrami on rye with fries had my number. The sandwich was right on the money. juicy and packed with meat. The fries were on the crisp side. The mac and cheese came free with my Yelp check-in. Cheesy, creamy and full of flavor.It was a typical lunch crowd with everyone enjoying their meal. Next time I'm in the area. this is a must on my list.   OH! And to Kyle S. Who has his taste buds set on Big Mac's and Dorito's. I am quite sure this fine establishment will be here way past your expiration date. So there is no need for you to return and ruin your youthful vibe to choke down a meal that was made in house instead of pressed and steamed at a factory overseas."}
{"text":"There are sandwiches and then there are SAMICHEZ. I would walk a mile for miracle mile!   I'm not sure about the entire menu mind you so my review is based off of certain Items. For instance the Straw! juicy Pastrami piled high with melted Swiss cheese and hot sauerkraut on rye bread delish. Ok I must admit I was a Pastrami virgin before the mile. So I have nothing to base the deliciousness of this pastrami against. All I can tell you is it tastes great to me.   Now I am not a virgin when it comes to there Macaroni salad and that salad came to party! It's really good!   The deserts are great to I love the pecan pie! I cannot even call it pecan pie it is PEEECAN Pie, not to sweet just right scoop of vanilla ice cream sets this off! The cheesecake is yummy and the carrot cake well it is some of the best I have tasted in awhile.   Also this little known tid bit, they serve farmer brothers coffee! Which I find to be the best of the pre-ground coffee's out there. I prefer farmer brothers over Starbucks any day.   Check out the mile and try the pastrami.   PS I gotta knish once, yea once. I don't recommend it Bluck!"}
{"text":"The pastrami was fantastic.  The service was fast and the restaurant was clean. The server was nice and all of the food looks authentic. Next time I am in town I will stop in again."}
{"text":"Paid $14.00 for Big Show Breakfasrt.  Asked for over medium eggs got over easy at best. This tells me they either did not listen to my order or cook does not know what they are doing.The best part is it came with pancakes and no syrup. When i asked if they had syrup I was told \"not anymore\"."}
{"text":"MM is in our rotation of office meeting catering choices. So my review is based solely on that. I have ordered from them about a dozen times. Our orders have always been correct and on time. The platters are great for large groups. There are assortments of cold cuts, cheeses, veggie fixins and a relish tray with pickles, olives, etc. The potato salad is good though heavy on the mayo. I really like the assortment of breads you get so you can make mini sandwiches: marble rye, onion rolls, and more.  The big hit of any meeting is the dessert tray and they have a really nice assortment of cheesecake, brownies, carrot cake, and pecan pie bars. Pricing is reasonable and it's per person.   If you are ordering I would suggest to add a few more people to your order since I find we sometimes run out of the mini breads. I think they figure on 2 mini sandwiches per person, but some people can pack away three no problems."}
{"text":"Just got done saying how fresh and terrific Chompies PV was, is, and now: better.   Interesting, The Corner Bakery, a Brinker (Chili's) concept replaced Miracle Mile Deli in this location. Corner Bakery lasted less than a year, Miracle Mile built their business there for 10 years. lasted at least 10 years (by Fry's, 20th St. and Camelback).  Now, Miracle Mile is located 16th St, south of Highland Ave., went there tonight, 1/17/2018 and it was FABULOUS!!                                                         THE BEST!!!!!     They've got a deal, 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup, $10. Sheesh. Big fat Kaiser roll, corned beef, sauerkraut...AND A SIDE!! I got fries and they were good, hot, crisp...next time, either slaw or both.  The rye bread is so fresh!!!!  Miracle Mile knows enough to fry the sauerkraut ~ takes just enough unnecessary \"sour\" moisture out, and you don't need it.  (Because If anything should be dripping down your chin it's Gulden's mustard, not sauerkraut juice. God...so good, hot, moist, fresh, so good!  Real turkey. Not pressed turkey. Not shiny turkey.   You know, as I've gotten older I realized that it could be Boarshead or Subway, but shiny turkey is still shiny turkey. Again, this is REAL off-the-bone turkey.   Better than Chompies. Better, better deals, better attitude, a more family-owed presence.   Now, I know you're going to tell me that Chompies IS family-owned but I don't see the family visiting their restaurants...and...Lou and Lovey...???  By the way, let me ask you a question: have you EVER been to Chompies and noticed the manager, any manager that WASN'T filled with anxiety?   Because I never have. Every person of authority I've ever met ANY Chompies locations has been VISIBLY FILLED WITH ANXIETY.  Why?}  When you eat a meal that's so good you can't wait to eat it again, that's a good restaurant, a great meal!  {By the way, Miracle Mile Deli has excellent mac & cheese!  No excess. Excellent!}  Next deli fix?  Miracle Mile!"}
{"text":"I wanted to be a big fan of Miracle Mile Deli.  Wa-ho! and all that.  Well, THAT didn't happen.  So here's the whole story:  Some time ago, like years ago, I had a bad meal here and I'd never returned.  Truth be told, I don't go to Chompies much anymore either.  Deli food is a lot.  A lot of food, a lot of money.  A good deli sandwich is, \"half now, half for dinner\", but I'm not 20 anymore and it's just too much.  So, a few weeks back, I came to Miracle MIle for some chicken soup.  Just felt like it.  You know, chicken soup as in \"Jewish penicillin\"?  Well, it was delicious but more importantly, the sandwiches going out looked terrific!  A pastrami sandwich looked great, with sauerkraut PROPERLY FRIED for a short period of time.  Few, if any restaurants know this trick but these guys do!  Expensive, $11, hey-that's deli food!  Chompies is at least that much!  Also, on the line this day was a 25lb freshly baked whole turkey.  You could smell it from the line!  Great quality!  Today, May 20, I came in, feeling weak.  Got a migraine yesterday...where do those come from?  So, again, chicken soup to start.  Got a second wind and ordered a turkey sandwich.  With slaw on the side and fries.  Got it home, swear to you, the SMALLEST $11 turkey sandwich I've ever seen in my life.  Ever!    Called them back, spoke with a manager.  He said, after I'd asked for the 3rd time \"how much turkey comes on a turkey sandwich\"? and he replied, \"4 ounces\".  THAT SEEMS LIGHT.  Seems very light.  Let's figure this out.  For the sake of this conversation, let's assume there is no other cost than turkey.  Just for a moment.  We'll get back to the bread and condiments and stuff in a moment.  If 4 ounces of turkey is $11, that means it's $2.75 ounce.  That means their turkey is $44 per pound!   $44 per pound!  PER POUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  $11 / 4oz = $2.75/ounce.  $2.75 per ounce x 16 oz (1 pound) = $44.00/pound!  Let's take off some per pound, let's make it $2/pound.  At $2 off, that's STILL $32 PER POUND!  No thanks.  No matter how high the quality, no turkey is sold for half that much.  These guys have a viable business and they have the balls to ask for $44/pound per turkey, they'll just have to do it without me!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I thought this place was a good almost great deli.  I had the corned beef sandwhich and the meat was moist, not fatty, and fresh.  Their sauerkraut and thousand island dressing were both excellent.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that their french fries are just ok. The staff is super friendly and extremely helpful. It reminds me of a mix of a NY style deli and old fashion cafeteria.  I will be back and soon."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and my husband was craving hot Pastrami.  What he got was an amazing sandwich on an onion roll. The Pastrami was really great. Not very fatty but full of flavor and goodness. He was a happy man.  He asked for additional meat on the sandwich and got quite a bit for a nominal fee.  The mac and cheese side was free because I signed into Yelp.  I tried to take a photo, but it seems to be gone.  I ordered the crispy Asian salad which came with breaded chicken and a sliced Mandarin Orange.  Very fresh and delicious. A huge portion with a wonderful plum sauce.  So friends, I would recommend that you go there soon and often.  Not much atmosphere, but very clean, great service and really wonderful, fresh food"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try Miracle Mile Delicatessen for lunch the other day. Upon arrival I noticed the facility is very clean. The chef and other members of the team work extremely hard. I feel that they are accurate on the order, efficient, and provide good customer service. Our servers were on top of their game. The food is fantastic. Very reasonable for you and a friend or say if the office staff wants to try this restaurant. Miracle Mile Delicatessen can fit into anyone's budget and provides quality food. Most important of all I felt a positive atmosphere and energy. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"I appreciate the quality of the food here but I am not at all a fan of the experience.  Herded through a cafeteria line where they dish out food like im in grade school simply doesn't do it for me.  That alone would have me giving them 4 stars but when you consider that they are a little pricey.... That gives you 3 stars.  Maybe I am not cool enough to get it.  Ok I beyond laughed at the response to my review.  Well played!  I love a place that doesn't take themselves too serious and can have a little fun.  I'm giving you a star back because you made me laugh days after my meal."}
{"text":"I had heard of Miracle Mile and used to work near the one on Camelback but had never ate here until some co-workers invited my husband and me to lunch. Let's just say there's a reason why I hadn't ate here previously and it's because the food is just mediocre. There are way too many items to choose from and I think that makes it hard to perfect the food being served. I think if they narrowed down the menu, the food would be better. Also, being a deli, I would expect amazing sandwiches. Instead, they have mediocre sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and entrees like lasagna, stuffed cabbage, meatloaf, and baked fish. It really feels more like a cafeteria than a deli.   Upon arrival, you have to wait in line - cafeteria style. I'm not real big on this as I feel rushed and it reminds me of high school cafeteria dining. It was really hard to narrow down what I wanted to eat and honestly I can't even remember because it wasn't that spectacular. (I know I ordered my sandwich on wheat bread, which was just average.) I also ordered fries with my sandwich. I always think it's hit or miss with fries and this was a miss in my book. They were thick, but not steak fries. So they weren't too crunchy and a little too soft. Also, they really needed some salt or any other spice.   Both my husband and two co-workers ordered hot sandwiches - the pastrami and corned beef. The co-workers enjoyed their meals, but they were the reason why we stopped here to begin with. My husband thought his sandwich was okay, but again, nothing spectacular.  If the co-workers invited us to go back, I'd have to politely decline. This place wasn't really what I was expecting and I'm not real into cafeteria style dining. Obviously other people are, as the place was packed. Maybe they know something I don't?"}
{"text":"Here for a business trip and stumbled across this yummy little place. My husband loves New York deli style places and I have never tried them so he talked me into it. Glad he did. So many options to choose from. It's similar to a long cafeteria line but with amazing food choices and sides. I literally wanted every one of those sides! We needed up getting a turkey club and the Asian salad. Our son got the matzo ball soup & Mac & cheese. It was all amazing. You will not be disappointed with all they have to offer.   Try the lox plate! I saw it after I had ordered my salad and was bummed I didn't get that. It looks SO yummy!"}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had here is delicious! Service is fast and friendly. It's why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I love Miracle Mile Deli ! It reminds me of the Jewish deli I used to go to in Baltimore , as a little girl . Delicious food , and terrific people ! I like how there are workers there to help you with your tray . Very friendly and kind . Great customer service . I am on my way there right now to meet my friends for St . Patrick's Day !"}
{"text":"Great service and pleasant staff. I have gotten the stuffed cabbage every time I've been there now because it's something my husband would never eat if I did cook it at home. It's so good!  Maybe I'm hooked. Nice selection of desserts and gotta love that they have both beer and wine in individual size bottles. Double plus is the coupons I find online.  The only downfall to this place is that they close early. Yeah for the staff, boo for a customer with a late night craving for good East Coast style deli."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the price of a 1/2 sandwich, they tricked me into getting the special with 2 sides, so I still ended up paying over $10.  The Turkado on wheat was still good, but I would definitely not pay this much for a 1/2 sandwich in the future.  There was plenty of turkey, cheddar cheese, one lettuce leaf and a few red onion slices.  I didn't ask for tomatoe yet it was still included :(  And I had 3 huge pieces of avocado, which fell out when I picked up my sandwich, wished it would've been more like a mash or spread.  It also had bacon, and some pieces were really hard, like dry hard.  Even with my complaining it was a good sandwich.  I had it to go and baggie included 2 packets of mustard and 2 ketchup with a fork. and napkin.  I ordered the side of fries which were good, not crispy not soft either though.  When I opened my box at work everyone said something smelled really good, I'm guess it was the fried fries!  I also had the mac & cheese side, which was runny not really cheesy, but it was still decent that I had a couple of bites of that.  I would go again if someone else was paying since I want to try the pastrami!!  I went in on a Friday around 10:45 and I was the only person in line.  So I guess I missed the lunch crowds everyone else is talking about!"}
{"text":"I always hear great things about this spot and when I had a chance to go it was a must... I entered the restaurant it smelled so good I wanted to try everything but I went with the New Yorker and a cup of Split Pea Soup... I rate the experience as followed.  The New Yorker - A Split Pea Soup - A Staff - A  I was really impressed with the food here... I need to go back ASAP and get the stuffed Cabbage Rolls... Lots of great food to warm you up on these cold winter days."}
{"text":"Ordered a few sandwiches to go and most are pretty bad. The knish was dried and crumbly. The corned beef sandwiches are tough and hard to chew (very stringy). You will definitely need to knife your way through. And even my turkacado sandwich was messed up (ordered whole wheat and saw it marked as such, but resulting sandwich is on white bread). I think you can find better without much effort.  Quick update: got a message back from management the next day. I'm impressed that they spend time reading reviews and contacting customers. They agreed that the corned beef shouldn't be this stringy, so maybe we just had a bad experience. I will give them another try just on the premise that management is actively addressing concerns. Adding 1 star back for that effort."}
{"text":"I went to their newest location for dinner with my family the other night and was so impressed by the space! They really kicked it up a notch with all of their extras they added. I ordered their Slaw--it is my favorite--and was not disappointed. Make sure to save room for some pie!"}
{"text":"If you want to very best New York style delicatessen in metro Phoenix, this is the place!  My family has been coming to Miracle Mile for about two years now, and have never had anything short of a great dining experience each and every time.  Friendly, fast service with delicious high quality ingredients in every dish.  My personal favorite are the Papa Club, corned beef sandwich, and the cheesesteak.  One thing I would advise, come hungry! Everything comes as a generous portion.  If desert is your thing, they always offer a jumbo sized selection of pies and cakes.  Phoenix is in no short supply when it comes to NY style deli restaurants, but none come within a Central Park mile to the quality of Miracle Mile!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as people say it is! Went and tried Miracle Mile Deli on a suggestion and found it to be a great experience with plenty of options to choose off the menu. I can say that it's worth going out of your way not just for the quality and great tasting food, but the nice atmosphere of the place. The only bad thing I can say is that both the parking and seating area gets cramped due to it's success."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the new Turkacado sandwich and it didn't disappoint! I couldn't believe how crispy the bacon was and the soft, fresh bread gave it a perfect pairing in texture. LOTS of turkey and super thinly sliced onions made this Sammy \"hit the spot\" for lunch.  Get the Mac n cheese for a side... creamy, cheesy and yummy!!! My kiddo is a Matzo Ball Soup afficianado, so he ordered that and a strawberry milkshake. They serve a traditional Matzo Ball Soup, but if you like the more chicken noodle soup style, just ask and they'll do it for you. My hubby got the Mile burger and it was seriously some of the best pastrami I've ever had. It came on a super fresh Kaiser roll and with a generous 1/3 lb. beef patty. The BEST part of my visit...BREAD PUDDING!!!!!! My son took one bite and began singing an angelic version of \"HALLELUJAH\".  The. He commented, \"I think my soul just floated away!\"  Need I say more?!   SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT PEOPLE, or just get it to go!"}
{"text":"Life does not get much simpler than Miracle Mile Deli. Once a staple of Phoenician life, this Valley establishment now stands alone in Midtown Phoenix.   Walking up to the counter, you'll notice a variety of choices ranging from stuffed cabbage to plain ol' chicken soup. Don't be swayed. Get the hot pastrami. And get it on a kaiser roll.  Any real New Yorker (whatever that is) will tell you that this sandwich is pure garbage and will laugh at your choice. Kindly remind them that they are a trillion miles from the Big Apple and that you didn't ask for their stinkin' opinion. Then kick them in the shins as you dive into what is most definitely the best hot pastrami sandwich in town.   The sandwich is simple, just like the establishment itself. Just bread and meat. No filler. No dressings. But don't be fooled. A truly great sandwich doesn't require all the trappings of a $30 burger from XYZ fancy burger joint. All it requires is meat and bread and love. And miracle mile gives their hot pastrami a perfectly calculated amount of love. Tender, flavorful, and so consistent. The hot pastrami stands alone in a sea of sandwicheries.  Sure, the fries suck. And the decor is lame. But the food is fresh, the service is fast, and your memory of the hot pastrami on a kaiser roll will be the only thing worth remembering from your visit to Miracle Mile. You might also remember the time you assaulted that friendly New Yorker, but we won't tell anyone about that."}
{"text":"Tried to eat lunch here today, but upon arrival, the people in front of us were turned away and told they would have to wait 15 minutes before they could order and then he told us we could not order lunch because it was a new rule that at 11:15 am orders could be placed for lunch on the weekend and we would have to go wait for 5 more minutes. The couple in front of us and ourselves both left to eat elsewhere!   How stupid to turn away customers!  Hi Joshua,  Thank you for your reply.... before we went today, I checked the website, NOTHING is listed about you can't order lunch until after 11:15 am on the weekends! It says breakfast is served until 11 am. We were there at 11:05 am, back in car and leaving at 11:06 am. Per your website, we should have been able to order lunch."}
{"text":"Miracle Mile is the best lunch in town!!!! I've been going here for 20 years. They put so much into each and every meal/sandwich. They will make any modification you want. Meatloaf, stuffed peppers, the Reuben, the pastrami and sauerkraut, it's all good! There's a Hispanic guys that's been there as long as I've been going there. he is the nicest guy. I love this place. Best casual business lunch in town."}
{"text":"I was in the area recently checking out some of the stores at The Quarter and the wife and I decided to go to this location of Miracle Mile as I had some gift cards burning a hole in my pocket.  This location is similarly themed to the others ones in town, and being brand new (grand opening sign was still up on the north side of the building) everything was super clean.  I was also surprised at how many seats they had, seemed like there was probably over 200 seats.  Another nice touch in that department is that at a couple points in the queue, there were signs that said 'you will be served in x minutes'...very handy  seeing as how I'm sure they will have a lot of professionals in the area popping in for a quick lunch.    We ordered a Jax special (1.5 sandwiches) of the brisket on kaiser.  The brisket was good (even though my homemade is better :) ) and the kaiser roll was excellent.  The horseradish to supplement was nice and spicy, gave a good kick.  Also had a nice Dr. Brown's Black Cherry soda to go with it...hey when at a jewish deli...   The one drawback of the meal, which is always hit or miss at Miracle Mile, was the fries.  Seems like 50% of the time, I get fries that are definitely not old, but they are definitely not fresh.  I can't fathom why this happens so often, especially with the volume of people that they run through there.    Other than the fries, as mentioned, everything else was good, including the service.  In fact, they had someone carry our tray to the table for us, which is something I can never remember happening before.  Nice touch.  Definitely I will be back to the MM locations across the valley."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here yesterday for lunch. It was clean, and though it was busy the line moved quickly and the staff was friendly. I ordered the Brooklyn chicken sandwich on sourdough bread. It was pretty good, but not worth the $12 in my opinion. The bread became soggy very quickly. My husband ordered the bbq chicken sandwich and said the chicken was very dry.  We got two free sides of Mac and cheese for checking in and it wasn't bad!  Not sure whether I would go here again as far as the food is concerned, but we had a nice time"}
{"text":"The best Kosher style deli in town.   My fave place used to be Abe's but since they went kaput I decided it was time to give this place a shot. Boy did this place deliver. Not only was the pastrami sandwich  delicious and filling, but the sides exceeded expectation as well. Most places outside of New York don't know how to make decent potato salad or cole slaw. Miracle Mile delivered on both! (though do skip the macaroni salad, that's my one criticism).    I left feeling full and happy. If you haven't tried this place yet and are having a hankering for real New York Jewish deli food, don't bother going to any of the other places in Phoenix claiming to be New York style delis (you know who I'm talking about). Just come to Miracle Mile. It won't leave you feeling disappointed.   A note to the uninitiated: if you come here, order pastrami, corn beef, or any deli-type fare. I have no idea what their fruit salad or their pancakes taste like and you shouldn't either. Order real deli food and I guarantee you will be satisfied!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Miracle Mike since I was a child. There have been many locations come and gone over the years.  I crave the New Yorker sandwich and when nothing else will satisfy, this is the place I head to. The ambiance is basic, though clean. The food is good but not great. I probably go for more nostalgic reasons than anything, but it is decent. Though it has become a lot pricier over the years. We got five sandwiches and it was $67!!"}
{"text":"If your ancestry is from one of those weird countries whose name ends in 'IA', like Bulgaria, Algeria, Bosnia, Romania.... You're genetically predisposed to liking cabbage rolls.  I'm not, but I love cabbage rolls just the same. This place is where you go for great cabbage rolls. One usually does me in due to the size, but if you're Bulgarian or something, you'll probably want the entire chaffing dish. (I think those 'IA' people are a fairly large breed)  The sauce, slightly sweet, the meat filling features raisins for added flavor. They're a little pricey, but hey, where are you going to get cabbage rolls?   If you like cabbage, and you're hoping to get even with your satanic co-worker tomorrow with a memorable,  grey-matter destroying case of the farts you got from overdoing it on the cabbage, I can't think of a better recipe.   Don't deny your heritage...you're a fart-factory by nature. Feed the beast, I say.  Come here and be the 'IAN'  you always knew you could.  Note: A side of cole slaw and cleaning up your wife's reuben also helps in this endeavor."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been coming to this place with his grandmother for years. He finally brought me and I have never been so stunned with how many amazing food options there are. There are hundreds of massive sandwich combos you can create. From shredded bbq chicken to brisket bbq sandwich. To classic turkeys and meats. Amazing filling sides from max n cheese to soups and things I can't pronounce but taste amazing as well. This place is HUGE. The people have heart and put love into the food. It's clean and I've never once had a bad experience. I always leave with left overs and the prices leave my pocket happy.  It's a family place so kids are welcome. If you haven't come here you haven't lived. It's a honey hole. I wish there were more."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday so I could get my car washed at Danny's while having lunch (this works out perfect to kill 2 birds with 1 stone).  I always get the New Yorker on rye and it never lets me down.  They have great coleslaw and thousand island dressing so the flavor with the pastrami and rye work out perfect.  I like that there are a thousand tables here and 2 lunch lines so they can really pump you through quickly.  You can tell the quality of the food is top notch and service is always great."}
{"text":"What an interesting place. I felt like it was senior hour when we walked in. The place smelled great though.  Its cafeteria style service and they have a ton of items on the menu. This time around I went with the Turkado - turkey, bacon, avacado, lettuce, onions, tomatoes and yummy chipotle mayo. I got fries and a side of macaroni salad. Everything was really delicious although my order was the last time come out and everyone else got hot sandwiches so I thought that was odd.  I went with my company and everyone got the New Yorker, reuben or the tripple stacker. They were hot and delicious and we were all part of the clean plate club. The portions are huge.  The salads looked really great and so did some other items so I would love to go back and check more stuff out!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was not a great food experince. I was drawn in by the word Delicatessen.....to me it was more like a hospital cafeteria...and I hate to say it but hospital cafeterias are much classier!   My gut feeling as we lined up was to get out of there. I chose not to say anything as I had already refused my husbands suggestion of going through the In and Out burger drive thru and I thought it would probably be too annoying of me to refuse this as well! Little did I know he was having the same fears but also decided to just go with the flow.  My husband had the hot pastrami sandwich which was dry and to quote \"worst pastrami sandwich ever...the pastrami from hell\". I had the stuffed cabbage which was stuffed with what looked and tasted like raw ground beef....and that was the tastiest part of it! Eeeek. I had two bites.....and was not risking any more. We did not go back to the counter to complain or get our money back because we really could not be bothered waiting all over again and just wanted to leave.  The one star is for the fact they sell Snapple Iced Tea which without I would not have been able to revive my tastebuds."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. I like the variety and quality of food offered here, and the new building is nice. However, for a cafeteria style meal, the pricing is way too high. $12 for a burger and fries???  C'mon."}
{"text":"This is our third time here. They have a lot of great choices to choose from. My favorite is always the wonderful Reuben. We are from about 45 minutes away so we don't come often but this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"I'm torn between the good food and the cafeteria line process for what use to be a great deli so many years ago.      There is no getting around the fact that the food is good. but the prices are high for having to stand in line and order your food like you were back in grade school. For these prices there should be a wait person taking my order.      I had the Stuff Cabbage Roll and it is by far the best I've had anywhere. Mostly because it was stuffed and huge. Not some small pathetic thing, but actually worth the money. The sauce was good but typical and went along way to improving my side of steamed veg that didn't really taste so great until I dipped them in the sweet sauce that was left over.     My friends sandwich was good but a disappointment in size for the price. Any other real deli would have put on 3 time the meat.      To be honest the best side was my friends chili. I would drive across town just for a bowl of it and saw no thanks to the rest of the food, except my stuffed cabbage. It was just right. Lots of rich flavor with out being to spicy.       If you want a seat down deli experience try a better place. If your looking for a slightly over priced cafeteria meal that acts like a deli, spend your money here."}
{"text":"Has always been one of my favorites. Best selection of pastrami sandwiches in town. Fries and pickles excellent.Dinner entrees are superb. If you like stuffed cabbage it's fab. The cod entree is a must try if u haven't had it. Everything you can order is cooked perfectly and tasty. Only issue is what to order because it's all so good!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to get a pastrami sandwich, tender cuts of meat and friendly staff. How much more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I walk in here with the intentions of getting an egg salad sandwich, when the three people in front of me order a \"straw\" sandwich.. basically pastrami, sauerkraut, melted cheese and bread.  Damn that sounds good!!  So i end up getting the same thing with a side of fresh fries and a pickle.  These sandwiches are big enough to share with someone, but with me starving like I was, I quickly polished off the entire thing.  it was yum.  I used to go to the one that was at Christown, but it's been closed for many years.  I was happy when they opened up this location.  It's right next to work, so that helps.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick good quality meal. I love places you can walk up to, order and seat yourself. They offer a great selection of sandwiches and meals. I love the matzo ball soup, and the mac and cheese. Other diners I've been with have enjoyed the ruben also. Quick, flavorful and clean."}
{"text":"Delicious food and such a cute atmosphere. I highly recommend. The New York turkey sandwich was outstanding"}
{"text":"Please get the pastrami on a Kaiser Roll. It's fantastic. Whether you get the original sandwich or my favorite, The Straw (with Swiss and loads of sauerkraut, plus onion for good breath) you're in for Cured Meat Bliss. My review is based on the pastrami.   It's juicy, tastes great but not too salty, and most importantly, SLICED THIN. Too many wanna-be-delis on the west coast slice the pastrami super thick so the hipsters who eat it don't feel so mainstream. But I'll tell ya, pastrami needs to be thin. That's how this sandwich has survived wars, famines and every walk of political agenda - by keeping to tradition.   As said before, the fries suck. But that doesn't matter. The Straw is enough to feed two adults on its own.   The place is packed at lunch and a little more expensive for a to-go sandwich than usual (about $10-12) but it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Probably the worst tasting stuffed cabbage I've ever had.  It was sickeningly sweet (tasted sweeter than my soda!), and there were raisins in the tomato sauce which probably added to the sweetness.  The ground meat on the inside on the other hand, was very bland.  I thought when you had something as a \"special\", such as the Friday stuffed cabbage, that meant it was supposed to be really good?  The overwhelming sweetness of the sauce made it very hard to eat.  The only redeeming factor in the meal was when I tried some of the Straw sandwich (pastrami, sauerkraut, swiss), which was decent, nothing spectacular, but a whole lot better than the stuffed cabbage.  At other delis I've been to, you can get a whole lot more meat, and more flavor for about the same price, so I will probably be skipping any future visits to this deli."}
{"text":"The last thing I thought miracle mile would serve would be breakfast. My dad took my daughter and I for breakfast after church because none of us can stand daily dose. The wait was shots and the prices at Miracle mile are reasonable.the food is excellent!!!!!! It's the most basic food but they cook it so well and the customer service is amazing. I'm glad  they moved locations because the new location is beautiful and clean. They food is served nice and not and the servers are very sweet. I have gone back several times for their cinnamon roll pancakes."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Miracle Mile was at Christown Mall, so this was quite a change from what I remembered.  The pastrami sandwich is still a winner after 30+ years!  The mac n' cheese is a must try!  The eating area is very clean for a cafeteria style eating arrangement.  I had the pastrami and fries with the Yelp free side of mac n' cheese along with a large Dr. Pepper.  My total was $15.20 which seems a little pricey, but it doesn't break the bank.  Since there is no table service, I do wish they would offer a free refill on the large drink since it's packed with ice and priced at $2.50.  Overall, it's good food with ample seating, and best of all, it's very clean!  I won't wait another 30 years!"}
{"text":"I can't say much because I just dropped in to try the bread pudding (never had bread pudding before) but I will say that this place was a great first experience! I don't have anything to compare too but I do know that it was yummy and I devoured it. The staff is also super friendly so that's always a plus!"}
{"text":"We love Miracle Mile! We have been customers for years and drive from Chandler for the wonderful pastrami on Kaiser rolls! YUM-MEEEEEEE! The people that help in the dining area are extremely friendly and always helpful! The food itself is very good and the environment is clean, bright, well-maintained, and comfortable.  Miracle Mile never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Just went for St. Patricks Day.  I picked  up dinner of Corned Beef and Cabbage and a piece of cherry pie.  Great meal and I didn't have to cook it,  and lots of left overs . Even gave me rye bread."}
{"text":"Amazing service -- seriously best customer service out of any type of restaurant like this. Amazing pastrami, onion rolls, and Mac and cheese. All over amazing!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm..a Combo please!  Pastrami and Corn beef together at last on a soft onion bun with Swiss cheese (or without)..best thing when you are craving MEAT! Yep, certainly not a diner for vegans.  Miracle Mile has been around forever, and I love to have a great sandwich or entree at this location.  From deli sandwiches to daily specials like meatloaf, roast chicken even cabbage and corn beef, it's a miracle I haven't gain 20 pounds from here! And they have Cream Soda...mmmm.   Side dishes include fries, potato salad, salads, mac n' cheese and potato pancakes.  The portions are huge that you can share or take the left overs home for a midnight meal."}
{"text":"So if you live in Phoenix and you are in search for good Deli, its always a toss up between Miracle Mile Deli or Chompies Deli. I've been a loyal Chompies patron but decided to try this place out, being in the neighborhood.  First off, very clean and a very friendly staff. Organized like a Cafeteria. We ordered The New Yorker which is a Hot Pastrami on Rye Sandwich and a Reuben Sandwich, both come with a side choice which we chose French Fries.   Onto the food, what Deli doesn't have Chopped Liver and Bagels? The meat itself in both sandwiches was good, a little too lean for our liking though. The Rye Bread very OK. The French Fries very OK too. Its like cafeteria deli. Sorry going back to my Chompies traditional New York style Deli.   I finally glad I tried this place though."}
{"text":"Favorite deli hands down. The food is homemade and definitely comforting to eat! Whether you want to sit down alone and eat or bring family and friends, this is the spot to do so, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times in the last couple months.  Husband is more the deli fan than me and he likes this place.  He enjoys the New Yorker sandwich - pastrami with coleslaw and thousand island dressing on an onion roll.   It's a giant sloppy mess but he seems to be smiling during the consumption process.  Me - I'm not so high on this place.  I could list 100 reasons why but the biggest complaint I have is that if they call themselves a DELI and are going to charge $8-10 for a sandwich, they need to atleast use decent bread.  Let me tell you, the bread (whatever kind you choose) is nothing special - order wheat and you get Orowheat straight from the grocery bag, or an onion bun you could also have bought from your local Safeway.  I think they need to go visit Chompie's and learn how to buy real deli bread from someone who knows how to make it.  Portions are large, overly so in my opinion.  Made the mistake one time of ordering mac & cheese.  Ugh - it was a giant bowl of mac with pasty cheese sauce.  Soups don't fare much better.  Navy bean sounded good - but it tasted like canned pork&beans with a thinner base.  One thing they seem to have right is the NY attitude.  The line servers are generally pretty nice and helpful but as you get down the line toward the cashiers, watch out.  They seem to consistently have snarly attitudes and are in a big rush to take your money and get on with it.  No smiling allowed.  Ok then, maybe they've been eating the food here too."}
{"text":"This place is really good.   If you like a good sandwich, then you need to stop in and give this place a try!  They have other dishes, salads, soups, breakfast and more...  but I seem to always go during lunch time.   Everything is super fresh, staff is great and it's a really clean atmosphere.   Been 4 times now, haven't tried the same thing twice and everything has been tasty."}
{"text":"This place makes the best reuban sandwiches, juicy and delicious. Every time I visits I am always impressed by their good service and quality food."}
{"text":"A simple, healthy, pleasant meal without pretense in the Scotts Rd/Frank Lloyd Wright neighborhood.  Yeah, right - it doesn't exist except at Miracle Mile.  Anytime we want to eat, we always have to choose between spending over an hour doing it (between waiting for a table and service focused on upsell), gut busting food or driving 15 minutes away (back to the hour plus).  Miracle Mile has great diversity on their menu, gets you in and out, and has tons of seating in a pretty pleasant and very clean dining area.  Miracle Mile probably isn't worth driving out of my way for, but I'm sure glad it's nearby."}
{"text":"So, I love deli food.  a lot.  I've tried a few deli's out here, including these guys, and I have to say, I think I like them!  Prices here are typical deli, but from what I can tell, cheaper then others.  You can get just about anything, anyway you want.  I love how they have Matzoh Ball soup, big huge deli sandwiches, and all the fixings.  YUM!  The past few times I've eaten here, its been on lunch with coworkers.  I've kept it light with my order, since falling into a food coma and taking a nap at my desk after a huge lunch is generally frowned upon by management. I've gone with the Kosher beef hot dog, fries, pickle, and tiny pop for a grand total of $5.24.  My friend usually gets the tuna on wheat while here, and she likes it here as much as I do!  What I do find odd, is that its buffet style serving.  You walk through the line, give your order, and walk down with your plate while the guys behind the glass fix your order.  Service here is quick and efficient, and seating is plentiful, even during the lunch rush.  I would recommend this place to most anyone, and they have multiple valley locations.  yummy!"}
{"text":"I was up in Scottsdale doing some shopping on Saturday, and decided to stop here and get something to eat. I love deli food, and figured this was the place to stop.   I dont dislike this place.  I could (and would) take my mom here and probably have a good time.  Thats not my point. but, I found a few things that irked me, and I was torn between 3 and 4 stars.  When I walked in, I noticed its cafereria style deli.  You stand in line, order, and they scoop your food onto a plate and serve you.  The line was long, and if I was in a hurry, I would have turned around and left.  I stayed, because I wanted to try the food.  My first grave disapointment was not only the long line, but the menu overhead.  It seemed kind of McDonalds-ish, and slim.  I grabbed a menu and realized they have a ton more dishes that didnt appear to be overhead.  really?  why is that?  Delis are supposed to have huge menus!  argh.  Anyways, I didnt want a HUGE meal.  I wanted a light lunch, not a 10 pound pastrami sandwich for 10 million dollars.  After reviewing the menu, I decided to get the 3 Latkes (potato pancakes) for $5.95 and a drink.   I placed my order, and the service was nice enough. (no complaints there, really.)  It was awkward because I moseyed up to the register and paid, for a grand total of $8.04.  (ouch!)    I mean, its a deli, and deli food aint cheap, but dam, thats a lot, considering Im not gettting waiter service, sit down treatment, and its not like your making it fresh for me from a batter on the grill.  You probably have some premade latkes that your reheating for me, and serving.  when they came out, thats kind of how they tasted.  They werent bad, but they were mostly greasy, and kind of floppy.  Usually, a good latke is more firm, and will have some \"grease\" from the grill, but this was more then that. Meh.  Anyways, seating was at your own risk.  Lots of big party tables, and a few scattered 2 tops.  I guess they anticipate lots of large 8 person parties to come here and dine? I kind of feel bad for taking up a  person table because theres no where else to sit.  This place isnt bad, and its a great alternative to Chompies.  I dont want to sound overly critical, but I feel like its got room for improvement.  Some of the food looked kind of sad, and considering how expensive it is, I think they could do a little bit more with presentation.  I mean, scooping me brisket out of a hotpan and charging me an arm and a leg seems kinda poopy, ya know?"}
{"text":"I had the Reuben.  The bread was toasted perfectly and the portion was generous with just the right amount of sauerkraut.  Unfortunately, for an $11.5 sandwich I was expecting real corned beef not the \"Fake\" compressed and glued meat I was served. The meat was filled with tiny bubbles and given the lack of fat it must be a manufactured product (see the photo posted here).  Real shame too.  I think you can do better at other places for a Reuben sandwich."}
{"text":"Excellent place for pastrami sandwiches. Good portions at a fair price. The coleslaw is excellent and they have many other great temptations like seasonal beer."}
{"text":"Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac 'n' cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac 'n' cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great deli food then this is your place!   Miracle Mile can make you just about any sandwich (hot or cold) your heart desires, but where they really shine is in their pastrami and roast beef cuts. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. You choose whatever bread you'd like (I go with marble rye most of the time); they have plenty of options and they are always fresh and delicious. Once you've chosen your base you can put whatever you want between your slices and make your sandwich as simple or complex as you want. Along with bread, meats, and toppings you also have side options that include potatoes in various forms (mashed, fried, salad), macaroni salad, mac and cheese, coleslaw, salad, veggies etc. If you have a sweet tooth grab a cookie or piece of cake at the end of the line and enjoy!   Most delis aren't exactly inviting to eat in, but Miracle Mile is a great place to pop a squat and chow down. It is clean, comfortable, and a good place to relax and enjoy. If you don't want to eat in or are in a rush you are in luck, they have a go go window...yes a to go window! Call in your order to pick up or walk up and order to have it ready in a jiffy. You just can't go wrong with this yummy deli!"}
{"text":"I was driving by looking for a place for lunch and I stopped in, hoping for some deli food.   I was quite surprised to see that it's actually an old-school cafeteria. I didn't know that these places existed anymore and I was ready to be charmed.  Alas, that was not to be.  Although I came inside in the mood for pastrami, watching the staff throw together - and I mean that quite literally, I've never seen anybody, anywhere make a sandwich as quickly or carelessly - I lost my nerve and ordered the meat loaf special, thinking that was probably a better way to go in a place like this.  Unfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes.  Absolutely devoid of any flavor and covered in a gloppy gravy.  Seriously awful.  I see that one reviewer described it as hospital food.  That's being charitable because some hospitals actually have edible food.  It's more like what I imagine prison food to be like.   It's also not particularly cheap.  My prison plate was $9.73 with the tax.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Miracle Mile has always been amazing and that hasn't changed since they moved (again). The service it top notch and I just love the friendly fellas who take your order and prepare your food. The food itself is very tasty and I'm happy I was able to find them again!!"}
{"text":"I am astounded at all the positive reviews. This place was nasty and overpriced. Yeah, the manager came by with a free, gimmicky, baby cookie, but that doesn't make up for the horrid food. The turkey was dry, the macaroni'n'cheese tasted about as processed as it gets and the vegetables were dry and flavorless. One visit here and I'm donezo. Normally I don't hate a place this much and then get instantly compelled to review it on Yelp, but anyone reading this, go to Jason's Deli or even Subway... BOO!"}
{"text":"I came here after our Escape the Room experience. This is the new location. Very nice, clean, and modern looking. Still same old. Same old. Wait I'm the line with a nicely lit up menu board above so all can see. This place still reminds me of a cafeteria style eatery.   Oh well so be it. I ordered my usual which is the New Yorker on a Kaiser roll. They slap thousand island dressing on the roll with hot pastrami and coleslaw. It comes with fries. Cause I Yelp checked in, you get a free side of Mac and Cheese too.   So I would have to say the hot pastrami was good. Not great. Didn't stand out to me. It's a good portion sandwich. The Mac and cheese was ok. Nothing special. Actually thought it was a little bland.   So we find our own table and when you done their people are really good at cleaning up your table and taking your finished tray.   To be honest with you, lots of people come here. Good food. Not great. Nothing to write home about. My personal feeling is that they get a lot of people cause there really isn't a good deli around. This is a $$ place for a sandwich. Little pricy for a sandwich. Like I said it's good. Not great. Will I be back? Maybe. Maybe not."}
{"text":"It was awesome and unexpected that the owner Josh gave my husband and I a letter and a couple of free meals to come back and give it another shot. He said it was just an off day and in no way a representation of the restaurant. I've been back several times and haven't seen a fly since. The food has been excellent as usual and we highly recommend Miracle Mile to everyone!"}
{"text":"BEST NYC style sandwiches in the Phoenix area! Homemade soups and more! Generous portions and excellent food!  The line moves pretty quickly. It's sort of cafeteria-style. After you get your food & pay, find a table. Very clean and lots of tables. Friendly service too. I've been eating at MMD since it was at Christown Mall decades ago. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Average corned beef at best.    Average matzo ball at best.  A walk up and order deli.  Nothing special here"}
{"text":"We ordered a salami and a club sandwich. The salami appeared to be taken eight out of a packet and had a very gross, highly processed meat. The club had no taste. Potato salad and the slaw were not tasty either. Grew up on Phx. and this is not what I remember. Would not recommend. Felt we got punked on the price for the poor quality of food. Could have made a better sandwich at home."}
{"text":"Hands down the best deli around!! I always get the brisket of beef on an onion bun. So tender and delicious!!! Now that I've written this, I have to go. Now!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Miracle Mile since I was a kid, back when they used to have a location at Chris-Town Mall. (I just aged myself!) Anyways, I always got the same..well almost. A triple decker or the New Yorker and a YooHoo to wash it all down! My goodness!  But I went without it for a long time due to my service in the military and dreamt of Miracle Mile's yummy pastrami on an onion bun! So needless to say I got happy when I discovered a location on the East Valley!! So I dragged my boss, a first timer, and got a New Yorker with fries and an ice cold YooHoo! My taste buds were singing!  It was nice being able to relish in a childhood memory and see my boss enjoy in her first time enjoying it!  I recommend this place everyone and anyone! The best place to ever get a pastrami sandwich!"}
{"text":"The Triple Decker Is unreal!!! My favorite and get it twice a month or as soon as I get back in town. The pastrami here is so lean and easy to eat. All of the employees super friendly and nice!!"}
{"text":"Warning: This place will give you a guaranteed food coma.  This place is a deli styled restaurant where you order and get your food at the register and self seat. The place is pretty big and has a lot of open seating.   I ordered the matzo ball soup and Ruben sandwich. Now let me tell you, that sandwich is massive. It comes with a side and a pickle. I ordered fries which were nicely cooked. The sandwich was delicious. The meat was tender and I had a very happy stomach. It was my first time having a matzo ball soup and I thought it was okay. It didn't have too much flavor and was a little bland which was fine because everything else was so heavy.   I probably would come again if I was craving some deli food."}
{"text":"Bigger is not always better, and this place proves it. The sandwiches are plenty, and the dishes are heaping, but the food is not flavorful. Add salt & pepper! Very clean and always busy, so nothing bad... Just decent."}
{"text":"This place makes me appreciate Jimmy Johns.  This place makes you feel like cattle being herded to the trough.  It's a Miracle they are still in business. You can get better sandwiches at Whole Foods or Jimmy Johns for a lower price!"}
{"text":"Cafeteria food, no flavor   I did a combo with the turkey sandwich, salad, and mac, I have to say I think my favorite thing might have been the pickle. For $11 bucks really,.. no thanks. Plenty of better deli's around here"}
{"text":"Hands down the best deli in town. Awesome food and an abundant variety. Huge portions and excellent service. What else can you ask for?  I typically get a combo pastrami and brisket on a onion roll with Swiss. However, some of my other favs are: the beef stew, stuffed cabbage, chicken enchiladas and the BBQ sandwich.   Long live Miracle Mile Deli!"}
{"text":"This place is hard to find.  The address is on Camelback, but it's in a huge shopping center and actually faces the side on 20th.  Despite a few nods to Jewish deli style, like challah and matzo balls, it's not even a kosher-style deli let alone actually kosher.  It was breakfast, so I had an omelet.  You get 5 out of a too-short list of add-ins.  Wish there was more kinds of cheese.  But the ingredients were all fully mixed-in and quite tasty."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Everytime I go I either get the pastrami or the corned beef, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu but everything looks delicious here and I am sure it all is.  The pastrami and corned beef are amazing, never too much fat and never dry, and most importantly never chewy and always tender, perfect every time.  Granted I have never been to New York, but I feel their pastrami and corned beef is probably as good as anywhere."}
{"text":"The food here is great and wow they are fast. Don't worry if it is packed; they will move you in and out in a hurry."}
{"text":"Went with 2native NewYork City friends. They said \"be sure to say this is the real deal.\" This is the real deal, Yelpers. Amazing meats and breads. Great sides (fries not so much) and pickle slices that will leave you thinking you are pregnant...you will crave them when you leave. Yes there is YooHoo and Dr Brown. No egg cream, whatever that is. Seemed to be the only thing my friends thought was. Missing. I didn't save room for dessert which I regret. That bread pudding and cheesecake looked fierce. When I go back (for more pickles) I will remedy that."}
{"text":"Great food, and sandwiches. Family owned, staff is great.  Daily specials.  Amazing food & fresh, the staff is awesome"}
{"text":"the food was cold including the soup,fries.  the brisket was dry and the service was awful.  The ruben was awful."}
{"text":"All I can say is amazing corned beef sandwiches. Every time I go there I am never disappointed. The staff there is super friendly as well. Always a great experience when I come in."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and generous portions. The service was great, the guys serving were very nice and helpful. Definitely a place to try out!"}
{"text":"Dear Miracle Mile,  This is the last time you will ever sucker another $15 bucks from me for bland, over-salted cafeteria food. I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.  Unless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears.   Stale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.  And then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix!   Although I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. \"Next? Bread?\" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. \"Fries?\" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. \"Drink?\" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!  Wait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.  Well I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car.   Wishing you the bland, inoffensive dreams of an automaton, Erica"}
{"text":"While I'm not a big corned beef or pastrami fan, my coworkers love this place. Every time I go, I manage to find something good to eat as there are endless choices of food to eat, and its all pretty good. I'm a big fan of the matzo ball soup here and the sandwiches are all piled high with meat and cheese. It's a little pricey but worth it for the large selection. Is this a traditional back east deli? No, but worth a shot for sure, as you just might find something you like."}
{"text":"Kinda sorta like NYC but not quite.  Really good.  I mean really, really good but not The Stage or Katz's but not too shabby for Phoenix.  Fast, friendly and great chow for a joint in Phoenix Az.  Totally worth the trip and I would recommend the Pastrami or the Brisket."}
{"text":"This place is great! GREAT quality meat and large bread selection. Good sides as well, I have gotten the fries and mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was good, although I have had better. If youre in the mood for mac n cheese, it will still definitely hit the spot. Worth a try for sure, and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A million years ago my dad took me to Miracle Mile and I instantly loved the place. He would frequent it when he worked downtown and on and off over the years he would take our family there for lunch whenever we were in the neighborhood. I was pretty bummed when it closed down and figured that was kind of it for the place. When I was out driving a few weeks back I passed by the new location and wondered if it was the same family or someone else who just took the name. I was happy to see it's still the same owners and I finally was able to get in yesterday to try it out.   After staring at the menu for far too long I went with what I used to order years ago, the Jax (beef brisket). It's honestly too much food, but it's worth hating yourself after. The new location is clean and constantly being tended to by the various staff members. It was also as good as I remember and I wanted to try about 50 different things. I will definitely be back now that I know it's there."}
{"text":".  Have been going to Miracle Mile for more than 30 years.  Use to visit the one at Christown in Phoenix and never left unsatisfied.  Today, my mother and I happen to be in the area of 20th St & Camelback and decided to stop in and pick up an order to go.    First, I had to ask the cashier 3 times before I received a courtesy glass of ice water.  When we got home the following was missing:  No applesauce for our potato pancakes; no mustard for our sandwiches or extra \"au jus\" we requested; no salt & pepper; no utensils and no napkins.  The sandwiches were good (pastrami on rye and brisket on onion roll). We were happy to pay for any extra costs for our requests and did.  Unfortunately, they weren't included with our $28+ order.    What has happened to the great service that went along with the great food?  Don't know if I will return  Regards,  M.E. Schiraldi"}
{"text":"Excellent Straw sandwich on onion. Really like this place, wish they had a East Valley location. Ample seating with limited parking in this new location."}
{"text":"Had the best sandwich ever !!! Ordered the New Yorker and it was delicious!! Best thing was the polite counter help !! My son has Down syndrome and is non verbal the gentleman helping my son was so polite .. he asked him what he wanted and walked my son down the line and let him basically create his own meal by pointing to what he wanted .. he even help him pick a drink .. so many people are rude or get frustrated with my son but this kind hearted gentleman went above and beyond to help my son ."}
{"text":"I'm going to admit this.  I don't have a single Jewish or New York ounce of DNA in my whole body. I've never even been to New York ( I know, but it's on my bucket list).   My family is either from Cincinnati ( German and Scottish), or the Washington DC area (Irish and French).   But maybe a little bit of me is a reincarnated New Yorker?   There's got to be a little deli in my DNA strand, or in my memory somewhere....  Because I have loved this place since I was a kid growing up in Phoenix.   My parents used to take me in here for  potato pancakes and chicken soup and Hebrew National hot dogs as a kid. They ate Reubens piled with sauerkraut and Swiss cheese on marbled rye bread. I didn't know better yet, or I'd have had one too. .   Later, I got a job working at KLZI Radio one summer between college semesters  ( my dad got me a stint as a substitute receptionist) and it was close enough to duck in for lunch. Cabbage rolls? Sure! Matza ball soup? so what if it's 117 degrees, bring it! Liverwurst? were my friends around, no, well ok! YUM.   The lunch specials were cheap and affordable on my minimum wage budget. Besides, my dad said I just had to work, not that I had to save any money, right?  I still like this place, and you can still get some good stuff in here. I like how long it's been around, and I like their story.   It makes me happy.   Last time I went and got my dad and dragged him back to Portland I got some chicken liver and it was good.   Yum."}
{"text":"When I went in with my daughter we ordered vegetarian sandwiches and they were pretty awful.  I know they have great deli meats and such.  I complained, and they not only sent a gift card, they actually solved the problem!  I love that.  Now they have some decent vegetarian items.   When I just get a gift certificate from some corporate PR flak,  I don't even want it sometimes because they don't even address the issue.    Miracle Mile did though.  Thank you!  You get five stars."}
{"text":"Another valley must have!  If you've lived here in Arizona for a while, then you've heard of Miracle Mile Deli.  They've been very popular in the valley for some time, and for good reason.  Some of the best deli foods served anywhere, at a decent price, and very clean.  I saw someone comment that the place reminded them of a hospital with it's cleanliness. Well, it is very clean, but not to the point of not wanting to be there...that's silly.  Always good service and very quick.  I will always recommend this Deli to friends."}
{"text":"My fave for years, at the old location , has always been the Hot Pastrami on Rye. Because they had good coverage on Channel 3, on Veteran's Day of 2015, I stopped at their new location and was very, very, disappointed. I ordered the Hot Pastrami on Rye and it was nothing like the one I used to get at their previous location on 20th & Camelback/Highland. They skimped on the pastrami considerably. I guess to help pay for the new building they built. The old Miracle Mile sandwich was damn near 3 inches tall and the sandwich at the current location barely came to a little (very little) over an inch and a half. And that is including the bread. I can get more for my money at Segal's on 7th street or other places. they might be out of my way but definitely worth doing. Parking seems ample, but since it's on the east side of 16th street, and if you're trying to exit south on 16th street, you'll have to wait for a pause in north and south bound traffic unless you want to cruise the neighborhood and get back on Campbell then make a left. I will NOT go back."}
{"text":"OMG I haven't even been there yet and I love this place my husband Pete just won a year of free pastrami YUM!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! One of the best sandwich places in the valley. Definitely a great place to eat! People are always friendly there too."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly environment always a plus :-) went in the other day and ordered the triple decker pastrami sandwich and it was delish! I recommend you do share it with someone due to it being generously humongous. Will def be going back"}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious and fresh as usual, gerrardo and all the staff are always friendly and helpful. Always impeccably clean, and drive from Chandler to just eat here"}
{"text":"Every time I travel to Phoenix, I go to Miracle Mile. It is usually my first stop after I leave the airport. While San Francisco (where I am from) is known for its world-class restaurants, there are no great delis. Every deli in my city--from the traditional deli to the is-this-meat-or-is-this-tofu deli--pales in comparison to Miracle Mile. Either the deli has day-old, rubber-like meat or has bread so stale that a pigeon wouldn't eat it.    The sandwiches at Miracle Mile, in stark contrast to all of the other delis I've frequented, provide the perfect marriage between great meat and great bread. Their brisket and pastrami sandwiches are so good that every time I bite into them, I'm transported to another realm of consciousness!"}

{"text":"Even though I drive past the Miracle Mile probably once or twice a day, it wasn't until yesterday I actually got to stop in and try it out.    The ordering process is simple and easy.  Stand in line to order at the counter and take a number.  Once the food is ready they will bring it out to you.  This is not a full service restaurant but the food does comes out incredibly fast.    The Matzo Ball soup was delicious and a value item at $3 a bowl.  The Reuben was pretty good, they were able to substitute coleslaw instead of sauerkraut for me, but at $12 it is priced on the higher end.  All in all I'd love to come back to the Miracle Mile again.  Great neighborhood deli."}
{"text":"This place serves up a decent reuben sandwich. The rye is toasty, the corned beef is thing and juicy, the sauerkraut is tangy, the sauce isn't overpowering, and the cheese is nice and melty. Is it the best deli in Phoenix? Absolutely not. Probably not even the best deli within two square miles. But, the portions are outrageously huge at a reasonable price.  I do caution that the sides have each left something to be desired. The mac and cheese is reminiscent of the stuff I used to get in my public school cafeteria. The potato salad tastes like the stuff my aunt brings to the family barbecue that she forgot about until the last minute, and then it sits out for a while. Not great, but you eat it anyways. Even the fries typically come out a little on the soggy and sad side of things. At the end of the day, I'll go back regularly because the sandwiches make it worth it. I've yet to be disappointed by that, and that's what really counts here."}
{"text":"This place is legit! We ordered the New Yorker and the turkacado! Both were excellent! Not sure if they had a toasted bread option but that would be my only recommendation! This place knows what they are doing! Staff was friendly and service was so fast! We even checked in on yelp and got a free Mac and cheese which was delicious!! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I forgot how much I liked Miracle Mile Deli until quite recently when I realized I've been going there about 3-4 times a month.  In fact, I was astonished to find that I hadn't written a review of the place yet.  So here goes... First off, the food is served cafeteria style.  I know this turns many people off, but if you give the place a chance, I don't think you will be disappointed.  As I said earlier, the food is quite good.  My favorite is \"The Straw\".  It contains mounds of hot pastrami, melted Swiss, and sauerkraut.  You have your choice of bread and I always choose the onion roll.  If you like corned beef, try \"The New Yorker\".  It's similar to \"The Straw\" but with corned beef and coleslaw.  All sandwiches include fries and a pickle spear.  You can add everything from macaroni and cheese to steamed veggies on the side.  A typical lunch will set you back $10-$11, but most people can make 2 meals out of the sandwich.  File this one under my \"Best Lunchtime Eats!\""}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.  Their reuben sandwich w/ fries is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of their moist and flavorful brisket, but at the Scottsdale location, so lucky me, i stopped after a meeting and it was just as I remembered.    I brought a pound of each the brisket & pastrami for my sister who loved it too!  They have gotten even faster if possible since it was about 5 minutes to get it to go!"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks very clean on the inside. Came over to order a simple breakfast. The food here is delicious. The employees here seem to show a lot of enthusiasm than anyplace that I know. This is a great place."}
{"text":"I came across this place by accident and been eating there weekly since January 2015 and can say the following things about the place.  Staff-the nicest staff in any food service establishment in the Valley. Staff takes time out to talk with the customers. They know customers by name and always smiling.  Atmosphere-Nice and welcoming atmosphere. The 19th street location was almost like a cafeteria atmosphere with all the colors and white. It reminded me of the 1980s but can say it was so clean that I would have ate my food off the floor. The new location on 16th street is awesome. Complete opposite of the previous. I really like the take out window!!!  Food-I have tried almost everything on the menu and can say hands down that I have not had a bad meal yet. The food is ALWAYS fresh and delicious. It appears to be very high quality food at a very reasonable price. I would rather drive the extra 15 minutes and get a quality meal at Miracle Mile than a fast food establishment next to my house. I like the rewards card that they offer with the free meal after the tenth visit. Embarrassed to say that I have already gone through five cards. I may have a problem. LOL!!!!!!  Recent Visit- Went in for breakfast on 06/21/2015 for the second time and decided to order the Asparagus French Toast but  was told they were out of asparagus after selling eight in a couple hours compared to a few a week.. Instead, I got omelet  which was great. I like that I can pick what I want in the omelet, which I usually only like vegetables. Management gave me a $15.00 gift card because of the inconvenience, apologized and asked if they could make me a side of french toast. I told him it was okay and will wait until next time.    Overall Thought-This is one of the only places I will eat at in the valley besides one other establishment in Tempe Marketplace. I noticed that there increased some of the prices by $0.50 with the new location. I really didn't mind the increase because you get a lot for your money and it is really good quality. You can tell a lot about a place by the condition of their restrooms and the kitchen. Both are extremely clean and smell fresh, which is a huge thing for me when eating out. .Plus, staff are always washing their hands, which is another use plus about this place. I will continue to eat at this establishment weekly as long as they continue to provide the same quality of food and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"So I was reading an online discussion board about the best sandwiches in Phoenix and this place was suggested a few times.  I figured since it was pretty close to my hotel I'd give it a try for dinner one night.  I ordered a Veggie New Yorker.  My first mistake was ordering it on plain sourdough bread...you need a heavy duty roll to stand up to the sauce and the cole slaw they put on there.  I thought my sandwich was pretty tasty, but it wasn't the type of sandwich I'd want to have all the time.  I got potato salad as my side and it was really bland, I wouldn't order it again.  I highly doubt these are the best sandwiches in Phoenix but at least there were a lot of options to choose from...the guy in front of me actually ordered a whole turkey leg!"}
{"text":"It is by far not a true delicatessen, but more of an upscale sandwich shop with some soups.  The corned beef has little flavor because it's so lean, they do not make any of there breads, soups are average at best, hot foods are acceptable, there supposed boiled potatoes are right out of a can, chili is below average, and all there deserts are not made in house.  If you want to experience a real deli in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, head to Chompie's."}
{"text":"God. My family has been going here since before I was born. I highly recommend the New Yorker on kaiser, but pretty much anything you order here is going to be delicious.   Miracle mile always provides a great experience, it's clean, fast and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here yet. My complaint is with their recent Father's Day promotion. I went in and bought $100 gift card for my parents 54th wedding anniversary. The promotion said i would get to pick a bonus gift card with a value of $20 to $100.  I didn't get to pick anything, the cashier gave me a gift card card $20 and said \"congratulations.\"  Was there really any different values? Maybe they even gave those out to people they knew? I felt cheated. They should have just said you get an extra $20 gift card, totally wasn't worth the additional effort i went through. I wouldn't have bought $100 worth either."}
{"text":"Visiting PHX from NYC, I was looking forward to testing the mettle of this pretty popular lunch spot. I drove passed the restaurant multiple times during my stay to find the parking lot full - that's pretty impressive for any place that labels itself a \"Deli\". It had to be awesome, no?   No. The \"New Yorker\" - Pastrami and Cole Slaw on Rye - was bland, boring, and bogus. It had no flavor, except for the tang of the slaw, and the bread was stiff, like it had been stored away in a fridge all night. It was disappointing, Kind of like when you wanted that bike for Christmas but then got two little rubber balls instead - one for each hand. But I'm not unreasonable or naive; I know it's difficult to make a pastrami sandwich that can stand next to the greats like Katz's or Langer's (2nd Ave Deli, Carnegie Deli, etc). I don't walk into a Deli in Phoenix expecting the Pastrami Gods to rain down on me a storm of deliciously irresistible and perfectly sliced pieces of cured meats; I don't have unrealistic expectations. I just wanted a decent pastrami sandwich but I didn't get it. It fell flat, completely flat.  Having said all that negative stuff, though, I must admit that the restaurant itself is well-run, overwhelmingly clean, and their service is top-notch - everyone was pleasant and helpful. Also, I can't deny that all the food looked appetizing and fresh. My sandwich fell flat but I can't speak to anything else. My son had the kid's hot dog and he loved it. I would suggest try the food. The food on the menu and behind the deli case looks good. Give it a shot. I might if I had to but I wouldn't order the pastrami sandwich (or \"New Yorker\") again."}
{"text":"Best beef brisket sandwich ever!  I've been a miracle Mile Deli fan for 30+ years and they never disappoint! Absolutely DELISH!!!"}
{"text":"I always try the straw but don't get tje sourdough bread its really soft and will be mush tje tje time the pastrami is added."}
{"text":"Everyone who works here is very nice, the food came out a little wrong and the manager was quick to fix it and got us out fresh stuff immediately."}
{"text":"So we have been living in the area for 20 years, and this was the first time eating here.  From what we understand, the other location was larger, but this was just perfect for a quick quality early Saturday lunch. Why now after 20 years?  Truthfully, we've largely given up on restaurants after many disappointments.  We are also fortunate that one of us is a terrific cook, and usually prefer home-cooked meals. But everyone wants to have a go-to place or two, and now we have one.    Parking was no problem.  The food was fresh and high quality, everyone was professional and pleasant, and as others have mentioned, the place was clean. Pretty much everything Chompies claims to be, Miracle Mile really is!"}
{"text":"I'd been craving some legit deli food.  I'm snobby about sandwiches.  I grew up in PA and spent much of my free time eating and hanging out in Manhattan and Philadelphia, two cities full of prime delis!  I had high expectations walking into Miracle Mile.  It just emits a vibe of deliciousness and authenticity.  My friend Jen recommended this place, and she ordered a reuben that looked amazing even to my vegetarian gaze.  I ordered a NY veggie sandwich on a fresh roll.  Good god, y'all!  That sandwich took me to heaven for a moment!  Best of all... (are you ready for this?), I substituted my french fries for a 100% real, 100% fresh potato pancake for an extra 95 cents!  It was soo soo good I kinda came close to crying into it.  You see, it's outdoor bazaar season in Pennsylvania, meaning potato pancakes are being cooked every weekend in every Polish church parking lot for miles around.  I've found a cure for my PA summertime homesickness: Miracle Mile Deli."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I came into Miracle Mile...I knew one thing, I was HUNGRY!  This place is like a higher priced buffet.  It has lots of meats, deli items, sides and digital menus.    This place surprised me with their service and the decor inside.  I am happy I stopped here because it filled me up!  There portions are huge and easily sharable with someone who is also hangry.    The location is ok.  It is traditional and modern and I enjoyed the grub."}
{"text":"This place is exceptionally popular around lunch time and for good reason!  Upon walking in you're engulfed by sweet/savory aromas and the quiet din of dozens of conversations.   The line to order is usually 5-15 groups deep, which provides just enough time to scope the menu, listen to other guests, and debate amongst your party what to get.  The menu consists of 7 adjacent 40\" televisions floating above the serving line and offers a typical, albeit, varied and delicious selection for a deli. These televisions also scroll through different pictures of popular dishes. If you didn't bring your appetite, that's okay, after a few pictures it will be sure to find you.  The food is incredible. High quality cuts of meat, hefty portions, and an appropriate price. Pictures just can't do it justice.  The serving staff, cashiers, and bussers are exceedingly friendly and very accommodating.  Tips for lunch time:   1. Carpool. Carpool. Carpool. The place is deceivingly large and can hold an impressive number of people. 2. Get a seat/table for your group when you walk in. (Or don't - staff seem try to find you a place or make a place for you - did I mention they were accommodating?) 3. Unless you have a 2 hour nap scheduled after lunch, get a box. You can eat the entire meal in one sitting and be completely satisfied, but don't say I didnt warn you about the impending food coma.  This place is everything and more than what I'm looking for in a place to eat."}
{"text":"Loved this place for years, when I first remember it as a child at Chris-Town Mall. The pastrami is excellent and the coleslaw best ever."}
{"text":"Great deli menu, generous portions and everything I've ever had here has been fantastic. Just like Mom used to make.  Everyone is friendly, the service is superb. We're regulars now. Gotta try this place out!"}
{"text":"Service here is great and FAST which is good when you're there for lunch on a work day.  Arrive at 11:30 to avoid the lunch rush (and trust me, there will be one).  I heard the pastrami is amazing, but I haven't tried it yet.  My coworkers got it and it looked awesome, although super messy to eat with all the sauerkraut and cheese overflowing everywhere.  I got the basic hotdog and fries.  I really liked it, even though it was just a plain hotdog you could get anywhere.  I'd like to come back and try a sandwich or something."}
{"text":"the sandwiches are decent, nothing amazing or special. I got the triple decker, which has layers of hot pastrami, bread, and their special sauce. the best thing about my meal was the French fries and pickle.  the atmosphere of this place was kind of yicky to me for some reason.  it wasn't dirty or anything, maybe just a little outdated and not very inviting.  the positive about this place is that your food is prepared VERY quickly. if you are looking for a quick lunch, this would be the place."}
{"text":"I've never been to a place like this. Wow!  All I can say is that I wish there was a Miracle Mile near my house, then again I'd be unhappily very over weight.   Yelpers, go here now! This is what Yelp is all about, finding a great spot and I have Yelp to thank for finding this place."}
{"text":"Love the new location. It looks even more of east coast diner. Most New York-like deli around. Everything I've had is good. The corned beef sandwich is is so good that the sandwich does not need any cheese or condiments because it is good by itself.  The fries are actually pretty bad and need some seasoning. I also wish the prices were a little more reasonable. Other than that this place is amazing!!!!    Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get a free Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Grew up here--straw w/corned beef...thanks for keeping this tradition going George & son Josh!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum , this place always exceeds our expectations and has great customer service Rafael the store manager was very pleasant and accommodating! We will be back best sandwiches in town!"}
{"text":"FAST, a great selection, and centrally located makes this a great place to meet people for lunch.  My only complaint is it's very hard to find anything healthy and the price is a tad high for the quality/ambiance."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Miracle Mile ever since I can remember, initially at the old Christown Mall location.  For my youth, it was the only Jewish/American deli I knew.  It's still great after all these years and location changes.  I've since eaten at a few deli's that can top it, but not by much.  I'm not going to run down everything I've eaten over the years; you know what deli's have to offer and this place is no exception.  Get your matzo/pastrami/corned beef/chicken soup on, homey!"}
{"text":"I still think they make the best corned beef and pastrami sandwich in town. Freshest rolls, tastiest meat!"}
{"text":"Food is so-so. Placed an order for pickup. Side was wrong, sandwich wasn't toasted and service was generally lackluster. Central Phoenix is known for great food spots. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Miracle Mile (in its various locations) for the last 40 years.  That being said their new location is kind of meh.  The food remains more than acceptable, but this size of the restaurant and the parking borders on the abysmal...especially during lunch.  Because of the mess the place is during lunch (seating and parking) I want to give them a 2, but the food makes them a 3.5 (which is not a Yelp choice)"}
{"text":"Had the New Yorker sandwich and a bowl of matzo ball soup.  Sandwich good.  Fries...good but needed seasoning.  Matzo ball soup...meh.  I think a chicken stood next to the pot when they were making the broth but chose not to get in the water.  Regardless, I still kind of like the place."}
{"text":"I guess Pastrami is the way to go here and I do not like that so can not offer a fair review on that. However, friends say it is pretty good. The sandwiches are fine but not a 5 star deli. They have a nice selection of foods and sandwich options. The desserts look good but I have not tasted any in a long time so not sure how yummy they are. I did not see any Black or White cookies nor Cannolli tonight but I think they have NY style Cheesecake now and again.   For my dinner tonight I had the Chicken Salad on an onion roll. I have had that a few times in the past and it has always been pretty good. It is not the best I have had but pretty good. I will leave it at that. They also have Knishes, which are hard to find in Phoenix.   The problem is this place is expensive for Phx standards. I just got back from NY and I paid more for three items here than I did for 6 items there. Hmmmmmmmmm??Of course the food is not nearly as good as the NY food.   I guess this is probably one of the better delis in town if you can not make it to Cassellas in Scottsdale or NY Hero in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have been to Miracle Mile before, just not this one.  Probably not a fair review because I only got a grill cheese sandwich. It comes with a side, I got chips and a drink. You get to choose your bread and I chose the marble rye. The makings for a great sandwich. So what kind of cheese do they use? Not real cheese. You know the kind that is wrapped in plastic and will keep in the refrigerator for two years and still be eatable.  On the better side my mother in law and father in law got a ruben and a turkey. Those sandwiches really looked good and they said so.  The service was as good as you could ever expect at a cafeteria type of eatery. Everyone was friendly and the people that came by the tables cleaning and helping guests were fantastic. I was very impressed with they way they took care of everyone.  Unless you are fond of imitation cheese pass on the grill cheese sandwich. Everything else looked good."}
{"text":"New location but same awesome food. Location seems small in comparison to past location at Collenade Mall.  My favorite is the Pastrami on Onion Roll which the Pastrami is top notch and the Onion Roll is fresh and soft.  Have been eating at Miracle Mile since it was at Park Central and Christown Mall, prices have gone up but during busy lunch time they get you thru the line quickly.   This new location seems alot smaller than the previous one at Collenade Mall and certainly less parking.   The same staff is there to help out and serve you the best deli food in Phoenix.   Will certainly be back again for lunch and will most likely order the Pastrami on Onion Roll with French Fries and a Pickle.   Pastrami Sandwich comes with French Fries and of course a pickle."}
{"text":"Classic Phoenix Deli that has been here since I can remember as a child at Park Central Mall and Christown Mall.  Best deli sandwiches and soups, my go to sandwich is the Hot Pastrami on Onion Roll. I don't think I have ordered anything else the past 10 + years.   Service is fast as you go through the deli line and always plenty of room for any size group.  Location is central to anywhere in Phoenix with plenty of parking.   Always clean and nice to done at, will be back again and again as long as they have pastrami and onion roll.  One of my favorite lunch locations"}
{"text":"I love the food here because its freshly made.  I ordered online for lunch and when I got there to pick it up, they hadn't made it yet but I was offered a drink on the house.  This is how you do business and this is why this place is successful.  I love the new location and I'm glad they didn't move far at all."}
{"text":"There is no possible way to fit the mile high sandwich into a normal size mouth.  No possible way at all.  At first I said whoa $10 for a sandwich but   once I saw it I thought I was getting a deal.  Soup was so so and lunchtime seating is scarce but the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Huge portions but the food is amazing. My fav is the straw sandwich.  I sometimes get half sand w fries or fruit or pasta salad or  soup in the winter.  The veggie soup is amazing! So fresh w big chunks of veggies."}
{"text":"This place is a cafeteria style NY inspired deli and diner. I love their Reubens and pastrami sandwiches. Check in and get a free side order of mac and cheese! Their desserts are amazing too. Everything is affordable and pretty good. I like the new location with great parking. Check the hours before you dine because they tend to close pretty early."}
