{"text":"Simply was not a fan of this questionable Portuguese grill restaurant.  Ordered the combination of grilled chicken, choriço and bifana.  The chicken was nicely done, almost as good as in Portugal.  The choriço, however, was terrible.  The bifana was very dry as well.  It comes with salad, a bland rice and fries or potatoes.  Opted for the potatoes (fried potato balls brushed with tomato paste and black pepper if I had to guess) and they were way too peppery.  They also left quite a few bay leaves on the plate.  Correct me of I'm wrong but, eating one could upset your stomach.  Staff was rather unhelpful and huffy as well.  Luckily, prices are low so it's not a complete rip off.  Outdoor seating was nice though.  I won't be coming back here."}
