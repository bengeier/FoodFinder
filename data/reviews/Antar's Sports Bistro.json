{"text":"Oh god. So, me and my 4 ASU MBA classmates decided to try this place out. We were enticed by the sidewalk with large 50% off coupons off appetizers, pasta, or pizza. So, like any normal human would think, it was 50% off all 3.  With that in mind, many of us ordered an appetizer to increase our value of the deal. We later found out from the waitress that \"I know, it's misleading, but it's only 50% off the lowest priced item....\" FAIL.  Other things that went wrong: 1. \"Home made\" Pasta sauce was disgusting. Tasted like tomato paste straight from the can. 2. Meatballs were very very chewy and weird tasting. 3. After 30 minutes of waiting, the waitress told two of my classmates that the \"dough was bad\" from the first batch, so my friends had to wait a full hour before getting their chewy flavorless pizzas. 4. It was Friday night, and the place was empty - should have been our first signal. 5. The owner then asks my friend how his pasta is (he ordered chipotle but it came out SUPER cheesy- like a fondu). My friend said it was a little cheesy and the owner goes \"Good to know\" and walks away......Didn't even offer to make a new one.  Just by ordering pizza and pasta, we spent 2 hours at the restaurant. They really try to keep you in the joint AS LONG as possible because they have so few customers...  Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."}
{"text":"This is your typical sports bar. It has a lot of good beer on tap and for a reasonable price. They have many tvs so no matter where u sit you wont miss any of the action. The place is also rather spacious and has outdoor seating as well. The food is your regular bar style food. A lot of finger food and a few \"gourmet\" dishes. The staff was friendly but always insist on the junkyard sauce which im not a huge fan of. Overall, Antars is a great bar to catch a game  or even just to hangout and enjoy a beer."}
{"text":"\"What the hell is a sports bistro?\" This was my thought when I heard about this place from others.  In essence, it's name really says a lot, but it's more about the food and drink than it is about the sports. I understand the theme they were trying to go for, but it just doesn't work with their location.  First, the location is really difficult to find. It's upstairs above a mill ave. pool hall. You need to take the stairs or escalator to get up there. It must have an elevator as well I assume.  The drink prices are dirt cheap at certain times during the day. I went a couple of nights and had 25 cent wells for about an hour, then they jumped up to a dollar after that I think.  I've only eaten there once, but it was to die for. I had the ribs, cole slaw, salad and another side that I can't really remember. The ribs were great, falling off the bone. It wasn't down home BBQ, but it was definitely better than a place like chili's.  Some nights they have a dj and dancing. Didn't really care for the dj that they had the night I was there, he kept cutting good songs short and would only play them for abou a minute.  The patio is a great place to people watch. The service is hit or miss. If you sit at the bar, you are assured of getting decent to good service, otherwise forget about it.  Overall, I would go back, but it wouldn't be a first choice on an average weekend."}
{"text":"Nice people, lots of TVs, large menu, decent prices, pretty good food.  I just wish they served guac with the nachos and quesadillas.  We were in town for Spring Training (Go Giants!) and wanted to find a place to watch the Sharks-Coyotes game.  The place was really empty for a Saturday night, and never really filled up while we were there.  It was good for us that it was empty because:  - There weren't a bunch of drunk, rowdy college students. (Wow, I'm getting old. Get off my lawn!)  - They asked us if we wanted to sit in the \"VIP section,\" which usually requires a reservation (or fee or something, I can't quite remember). We declined, since the section was tucked in under an overhang, so you could really only see one wall of TVs.  - They put our hockey game on one of the big screens.  When we walked in, they told us we could sit wherever we wanted. We told them we were there for the hockey game, and the host told us to pick a table and they'd put it on a TV near us. When we sat down, he told us to pick a TV.  (We picked one of the regular-sized ones on the wall.)  He went over to they A/V guy, and voila, the Sharks-Coyotes game was on.  A few minutes later, the A/V guy waved to me and pointed to the big screen on the other side of us. He had put it on up there. Very cool.  Since there weren't many people in the restaurant and they were playing music over the sound system, we asked if he could turn the audio to the game.  He said he couldn't, because it was a fight night, and because it was pay-per-view, they'd be playing the audio for that.  About halfway through the first period, he ended up flipping the audio to our game, since nobody was coming in to watch the fight. Very cool x2.  The emptiness of the place worked for us, but I hope they get busier (or we were there on an off night), because I want them to stay in business. It's definitely a place I'd visit again the next time I'm in town for Spring Training."}
{"text":"I used a groupon voucher $10 for $20 worth of food. 11:20AM I entered the restaurant, waited at the entrance for a 3 minutes, no server greeted me. Then i went to the bar. No bartender at the bar.  I waited 7 more minutes, and no one took my order.  I got up and walked out.  The place was not busy, i saw 3 people at the bar and no other customers.   This business has way too many flat screen Tv's. maybe the owner should have spent his money on good servers & bartenders instead of hundreds of TV's. lol  I will not go back to this Bistro again, i think i will try the Hooters restaurant just down the street from this business. Better customer service there."}
{"text":"The junkyard wings were great. Yes moan worthy. We went for happy hour midweek and the place was empty. I would love to sit outside and watch the street scene without cigarette smoke. We will come back and try healthier fare."}
{"text":"The Pros: LOTS of large televisions. They broadcast all the Coyotes games, which is a bewilderingly difficult feature to find at local sports bars. And they have Two Hearted Ale on tap, which is a phenomenal Bell's Beer American-style IPA. Actually, they have some pretty decent-good beers on tap, which is a huge Pro.  The Cons: The bartender was pretty unprofessional and really pushy. I ordered a pint of Sonoran Brewing Co's White Chocolate Ale (delicious), and the bartender decided to pour me a shot of the ale with chocolate vodka, which I drank. Then, halfway through my beer, he decided to pour a shot of vodka INTO my beer without asking....I was actually really shocked. I don't like people who do something to my drink without asking me, especially when I'm paying them.   The food could have been good, but I'm not sure, I'll have to go back. Instead of giving me the Raspberry Chipotle wings I ORDERED, the bartender insisted (as in refused to order for me what I wanted) that I get the Junkyard and if I didn't like it he'd pay for it. I got it, ate it, didn't like it, and received no \"well let me replace that for you and pay for it\". I asked for a side of the Raspberry Chipotle sauce, and he made a snide remark and gave it to me. The sauce was yummy, I wish I had just insisted on my original wings.   The bartender also kept bashing a coworker to another coworker, swearing and name calling loud enough for customers to hear. And he decided to count aloud how much cash he needed to make that shift to pay his bills. The guy was super unprofessional.   All in all, the food and beer were decent-good, but the service was obnoxious, pushy, and pretty terrible. I'll have to go back and experience another server to see if I like the place or still don't like it. Followup review will be coming soon."}
{"text":"I went here about a month ago and there was a foreclosure sign on the door. Are they closed?"}
{"text":"Okay, this place is a bit tricky to find.  I assume there's a sign that I just didn't see in the St. Paddy's Day crowd, but it looked like there was no indication that it even existed.  It took a guy telling everyone to go upstairs and check it out to get me to notice, but gosh darn it I took that escalator ride to the second floor and I checked it out.  What I found was pretty cool - a big, spacious sports bar with lots of TVs, big bars, and a patio section.  The patio section is going to be a bit small for peak hours, but half of it overlooks the street and half of it has it's own bar, so it's pretty darn cool in and of itself.   We just stopped by for a drink on our way down Mill so I don't have the most complete review.  The waitresses were nice, the beers were cheap (and green), and the buffalo wings smelled and looked amazing from a table over.  If I didn't live 5 hours away, I'd probably come by this place pretty often."}
{"text":"This place has potential to be great, yet it's really bad.  The place is huge, full of TV's, great patio but very slow, inattentive wait staff, and food is acceptable at best.  Today I bought a Groupon Now deal, I arrived about 11:45, there was NO other customers.  I was greeted by a man that looked like a repair man and he said \"Just to let you know we can only make you maybe wings or pizza's right now\".  I said OK.  He then said \"that's it, not sure if you want to stay\".  I should have taken the warning.  I said \"Would you like us to leave\".  He said no and told us to sit where we'd like.  Then another guy, that also looked like a repair man came over and handed us menus.  The full menu.  I asked if we could order anything, he said he'd check and came back to confirm appetizers or pizza were acceptable.  We ordered mozzerella sticks and a pizza.  The mozzerella came in a reasonable amount of time.  It was warmish, not hot.  But was OK.  The pizza took about 35 mins.  This is not deep dish pizza.  Just a standard bar pizza.  We had meatball, pepperoni, roasted peppers and spinach.  The meatballs were not great.  Pepperoni was pepponi.  The roasted peppers were just chopped red bell peppers...not roasted.  And I believe the spinach was basil based on the appereance and the taste.  And was sparsly added to the pizza.    Then we asked for the bill, and it took 4 tries ringing it up with the Groupon Now and a credit card.  We had paid for 58 mins at the metored parking, we ordered mozzerella sticks and a pizza and were the only 2 people in the restaurant for the entire order.  We were on our lunch break so we weren't taking our time...when we got back to the car our metor had expired.  That is ridiculously slow service!  I should have taken the hint from the guy asking if I was sure I wanted to stay.  Don't go to this Antar's.  I've heard the other location is much better."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY from this sports bar!  The food is terrible and the owner/manager is rude and does not deserve your business!!"}
{"text":"The food here is fine if they can get you what you ordered. As others have noted, the servers all seem confused. I've been here twice and both times the food took over an hour to arrive, and then one of the three orders was incorrect. Also on both occasions they didn't have some ingredient but waited 20 minutes to come back and tell us. Accidents happen, I get that, but when your servers look at me and say something like, \"do you really want me to take that back\" when they brought me the wrong food you've lost my business."}
{"text":"Not sure why my last review was blocked.  I put it at two stars now so hopefully it will post.  However, beware this is a half star place.    I reviewed Antar's a while back and it was great.  The last two visits were horrible.  The bartenders are awful.  Poor service with the manager feet away on his laptop.   I really liked thus place.  I am disappointed it has changed.  There is plenty of other bars with tvs and great service."}
{"text":"This...place....is....amazing. Upstairs and overlooking Mill Avenue, this has become my sports home. I truly can't say anything more about this site. The service is awesome, the prices are great, and unless your team loses, I can't say you can complain much at all about Antar's.   As an ASU alumni, they make me feel extremely comfortable. If you did not know, ASU and Antars came together and made it the official bar for ASU  Alumni   come football season. I began coming here for the NFL last year, and boy was I surprised. All the general beers are available here, and they just added Leinenkugels, a Midwest favorite. They also have solid regular prices for beers, very good general pricing for pints and larger. Specials on PBR, Coors, etc. are also too good not to note. Once again, if you are from the Midwest, this is up your alley.   But the food is where it separates itself from other bars. The food menu is varied and has a kitchen that pops out solid food. I love their soups, especially the Cream of Chicken , which uses much of the same contents as their chicken pot pie. It becomes so chunky and filling, its Cream of Chicken re-invented. They have a large variety of finger foods, but if you get beyond that you will see the difference. Keep turning their pages and you will notice. I will continually come back, so when I do get around to trying some of their finer entree's I will update. Needless to say, the quality is great. The menu will surprise you when you look through it.  The TV's are plentiful, and if you get there early enough on game day you can talk with the manager and have him hook you up with a TV and your game on it. I haven't sat outside of the bar area, but its spread out nicely and has great booths which you can utilize whenever. Finally, they have a sweet outdoor patio which is great for smokers (I am not one),  and great for people watching while enjoying a beer with the game in the background.   Go Devils, and go Antars!  -Jeff"}
{"text":"The owners of this place are totally accommodating. They bought a channel for us to watch the KU game once which brought me back several times. The last time I was mad and left because they wouldn't turn the TVs in the empty side of the bar to the game. Some of the TVs are too high up and hurts my neck. But they have good ones at the bar and the outside section is cool. Most the bartenders have been really great."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre.  The prices weren't bad though, $14 for my lunch, and that included gratuity.  However, the food took over an hour to get to our party, waitress complained about splitting the checks, and the fire alarm went off as we were there.  Our one hour lunch ended up lasting two hours because we waited so long for our food.  No apologies or any hint that they knew they were taking so long with our food.  It's safe to say our work will not be going back there for lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot to go catch the game or just grab a drink with a group of friends. I have eaten here a few times and the food has always been pretty good and has a good variety to choose from. It's a pretty big restaurant/bar so you never feel like you are crammed at a small bar trying to get drinks. Definitely a great spot to start or end your night on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Nice place, lots of TVs.  I was here for the first time on the night of the ASU vs UofA football game so I feel like the experience may have been somewhat less than authentic, but it seems like it would be a decent place on a normal night still."}
{"text":"I must say I am impressed by the atmosphere. The outdoor patio is nice, and so is the interior decor. There are lots of TV's to keep the sports enthusiast entertained, and comfortable lounge seating for casual moments. If this was a review of the building and decor, it would be 5 star for a sports bar.  Although, this is NOT a review of the hardware. This is a review of the restaurant; which includes the food, as well as service. Based on the latter two, I will NOT be going back. Our waitress lumbered through the order as confused as any newcomer would be. When asked how many wings come in the order; she had to finger through the menu to read through it with whispered tone. We can overlook this however; assuming our waitress was new. 45 minutes into our wait, our waitress came back with news that they had run out of an ingredient to make one of our dishes. Fair enough, but they could have come sooner for a re-order. Our food arrived 1 hour and 30 minutes after placing our order. And because of this, a member of our party ate cold wings; but did NOT return it for fear of another hour wait. We ordered burgers, some wings, and a personal pizza; absolutely nothing that would warrant that much time.  After being there for over two hours, our waitress gave attitude when asked to split the check.   This is definitely a place to go if you do not mind wasting 2 hours for a meal. And forget about this place for lunch. Where most (all?) places will gladly serve lunch and give enough time to eat within a typical 1 hour; or 1 1/2 hour lunch break ... this one will put you on the bad employees list as you stumble in to work late.  Oh .... and the food? It was great! Minus the cold wings. BUT, the terrible experience put food quality on the back burner."}
{"text":"My soup was like Elmer's Glue nicely serve in a bread bowl. The waitress took it off the bill but the food in this restuurant is just plain awful and the location hard to find."}
