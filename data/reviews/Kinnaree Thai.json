{"text":"Appetizer was good - had the deep fried shrimp rolls.  For our mains we had the garlic shrimp and Pad Thai. Neither was impressive. We were especially disappointed with the garlic shrimp - for the price we paid ($10) we expected a much larger portion than the 6-8 pieces we got and a bit more substance than just shrimp and a few pieces of roasted garlic.  We just added it to the pad Thai.  Pad Thai - good thing we ordered something to add to the pad Thai because there wasn't much to it besides noodles.  I think I would have enjoyed standing in line for Thai Express at the local mall food court - that's got better flavour than our meal today."}
{"text":"Finally!!! This is the closest you can get to real delicious thai food!  The curry was light and full of flavours unlike Sukho thai in parliament st.  I ordered their beef in red curry while my boyfriend ordered their chicken skewers.  Both dishes came with mango salad and spring rolls on the side.  Delish!! Service was fast and friendly. It was my first time here and will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"Driven by the location many times and decided to finally drop in for lunch. They have a limited menu for lunch that has all the standard fare. Curry, pad Thai, soup, and various rice dishes. This time around we had the paid thai and green curry.   The green curry was spot on. You will not be disappointed. The pad Thai was a little heavy on the tamarind for my tastes but still very good.  This isn't the best Thai food in Toronto but if u are in Scarborough and don't want to head downtown you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Quick & friendly service.  Ordered: beef pad sew noodles, and chicken satay. (both very good) Portion size: a tad to small (for the price), 1 order of beef pad sew was only good for one person...or maybe one person and quarter. when we go again would order two orders or something else as well. chicken satay was the appetizer; goo. came with peanut sauce and little salad. (yummy)  Bottom line: would return!"}
{"text":"I went to Kinnaree Thai for dinner today (Thursday) with my girlfriend (Thai) and my parents (Chinese). All of us were impressed by their authentic Thai food, friendly service, and beautiful decor.  Unlike many Thai restaurants in the area which are owned/managed by Chinese people, this restaurant is actually owned by a Thai.  The cooks and the waitresses are also Thai.  Surprisingly, we were the only dine-in customers when we got in.  So we got our food very quickly.  These are the 5 dishes that we ordered and thoroughly enjoyed:   - green curry chicken  - pad thai  - spicy beef  - tom yum goong soup  - mango salad  The value is good.  The final bill (after taxes) came to almost $50 for 4 people.  I expected to pay $15-20 per person for dinner so I'm happy that the meal came under budget, and we even packed quite a bit of left-over food home.  The only complaint I have about this place is its location, which is a bit out of the way.  Other than that, this place is a hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"Great little place! Good food and good customer service. Chicken Pad Thai is really good here."}
{"text":"Truth is, it's really hard to find a solid place for Thai food in Scarborough. Thai Express in the food court of a mall doesn't count people! I'm so glad I came across Kinnaree whilst browsing through reviews on Yelp.  Came in during lunch, and was offered a menu that described 28 lunch options ranging from $6.95-$9.95. They included a main, the choice of Mango Salad or Veggie Soup, and a Spring Roll. Can you say steal?  I had been craving Pad Thai for the last couple of weeks, so that dream was realized, and my mom ordered the Red Curry with Chicken.  First to come out were the Mango Salads. Totally standout in my eyes. Way better than Sukhothai which I've had on plenty of occasions. The mango was somewhere in between ripe and raw, and was seasoned with lovely sweet, savory, and tangy elements, peanuts, and toasted rice I think. I inhaled my generous portion in seconds. Next time I would ask for some Thai Chili to be incorporated into the mix for a bit of heat.  The Pad Thai was saucy and delicious. They definitely did not skimp out on the shrimp or fried tofu, which scores big in my books. Again, I would have liked some heat to this dish.  The Red Curry was also very good. Creamy, and fragrant from lemongrass in the curry paste.  The owners came around to speak with us after. They are just incredibly lovely people. The husband is a British Expat, and his wife is originally from Northern Thailand.   In terms of the heat level of the dishes, they told me to ask for things spicier the next time around (i.e. with Thai Chili), and that they'd be more than happy to accommodate.   Aww yes! I think I have finally found my go-to Thai restaurant in the hood!"}
{"text":"I judge a good Thai Restaurant by its Pad Thai and after tasting the Chicken PadThai today I lets just say I'm still searching for a great Authentic Thai Reataurant in Scarborough. Way too much ketchup and Tamarind Sauce. I doubt I will be back to try the Greeb Curry."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! Small and quaint restaurant, came here to get takeout. We ordered the thai spicy noodles with chicken, mango chicken, and shrimp fresh rolls.  We waited at the front for just over 20 minutes for our food, which was great because we could see into the kitchen, and the end result was that the food was so fresh, aromatic and tasted amazing. Even the veggies in these dishes were cooked perfectly. Owners are back there too preparing the food. Good hygiene, was clean and everyone was wearing hair nets.   We both loved the food and had other household members asking what the delicious smell was. Will definitely go back here for our Scarborough Thai spot."}
{"text":"I'm a stickler for authentic Thai, and its getting harder to find in the city as Thai chefs seem to cater to a more placid N.American palate... but Kinnaree is GREAT! I can judge a Thai resto by one dish:  its Pad See Ew, and this one is excellent!  I am coming back!"}
{"text":"I moved to the area a few months ago and found this place through Google.   I went yesterday with a friend and we were both very impressed with the food and the service.  We ordered shrimp rolls, lemon chicken and penang chicken. Everything was verry delicious!!.    Bonus Point:  I found out when I got there it is Halal!!   My family and a lot of friends eat halal food so l am definitely going back there.  The price is also reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was just OK. The food was at the table in good time but out of everything we ordered nun of it was what we had expected. All the food was good. But not great. Service was quite good. But for what we got I felt it was a bit pricy.  Maybe the lunch is better?"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food!!! Family restaurant ! Will come again for sure! Since I live not too far from here, it will be one of my regular takeout place!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Really delicious food. But sadly they closed down today. Coincidentally we came on the last day."}
{"text":"Best Thai food i've ever had in the GTA. Overall, good quality food with perfect portion sizes. Owners were also very friendly. I'd highly recommend giving this place a try. 5/5!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We ordered four 'foreign' things from the menu: Thai Iced Tea, Thai Spicy noodles, Spicy Chicken, and Basil Beef.  The Thai Iced Tea was mediocre: Instead of tasting anything at all like tea it was pretty much just sugar and had a slight strawberry taste to it.  The Thai Spicy noodles were super spicy and absolutely delicious. Definitely recommend if you visit. The spicy chicken was good too, although with the noodles, it was a little bit too spicy.  The Basil Beef was not so good. The beef was overcooked and overall the dish was just excessively greasy.  A bowl of rice from here was $2, I think. The lady who served our table mostly stayed at the back of the restaurant didn't even give us water until we asked her for it. We had to wait a while for our bill too because we couldn't find her at all for a while after we were finished eating!  There were three of us eating and the total came up to around $60. We were all full, but for Scarborough dining it's a little pricey especially if the food is just 'OK'.   Khao San Road's Thai Iced Tea definitely trumps this one, I think it's worth paying double for it."}
{"text":"I have been to Thailand ... and the food was what i loved the most! I loved to food so much that I spent half my trip going to cooking schools and truly learning about the flavours! Kinnaree Thai is 100% the real deal... the people are from Thailand 1st generation! and the food is bang on!!! You really can't go wrong with this place  sure the location and the decor isn't trendy but I don't care for that.... I rather take food that was prepared fresh for me when I order it!  And they do!!!   I recommend every check out this spot - Great work Kinnaree stick to the tradition!"}
{"text":"Went in after work around 8:30pm, wasn't busy. Only one server, super nice. Ordered a pad Thai regular, flavour was nice and authentic but noodles were soggy and really wet. Bill came out to be 11.50. It's a debate whether I'll be back."}
{"text":"We ate in on a weeknight.  The place was quiet but there were a few others eating in as well.  We had the spring rolls, pad thai, and the jungle chicken curry.  The pad thai was a little bland for me, but still tasty.  The jungle curry was extremely spicy - almost unbearably so.  It wasn't my first choice but my friend didn't like anything with coconut milk and I really wanted curry.  If we had also ordered rice, it might have helped, but we didn't want any leftovers.  The portions were generous, the room was very pretty, and the staff were great."}
{"text":"Authentic??? Come on??? We order Tom yum soup and if was too sweet. The green curry chicken tastes funny. The pad Thai was too sweet. The mixed veggies was too sweet. I still tastes sweet an hour later. There is just no way this is a 4 STAR!!! I give 1 star for good service."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. Some days the food is great, but more and more often the food is terrible.   2/5 visits, the food was horrible.   That's a game of roulette in not going to play again.   ------   Pad Se ew is fantastic! Mango Salad is great! Pad Thai is pretty good!  Overall this place has some pretty tasty Thai food! A hidden Gem"}
{"text":"We came here based on positive reviews on Yelp last Sunday evening.    The Vegetarian Tom Yum soup was not as spicy as I expected.  The portion was sufficient to share between 2 people.    The Red Curry Chicken was spicy but was not overwhelming or torturing which was nice.  It was quite sweet to my taste.  I would prefer the texture to be a bit thicker though.  The Pad Thai tasted authentic and nice.  It was soggy like Anna N claimed.  It was because Kinnaree used comparatively narrower rice noodle than usual.  Its thickness was between angel hair pasta and linguine pasta.  The thinner noodle soaked up more sauce, so each bite was more flavourful.  The flip side was that it was more soggy.    The Basil Seafood was delicious and spicy.  It was the most spicy dish of the evening.  There were a generous amount of seafood in the dish.  I quite enjoyed the dish.  There were only 2 tables including us.  There were a few take out customers throughout the evening.  Service was quick and super friendly.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Beef massaman $8.95 lunch special - comes with rice, a spring roll, huge portion of mango salad and a slice or orange. Everything was wonderful and I liked the variety you get in one dish and all for $8.95. The mango salad stole the show - there were so many ingredients in the mango salad and there were so many different flavours combined together. Simply amazing.   Chicken satay $9.95 with four pieces. Chicken portion was huge and this could be a meal on its own it was so big. Comes with a small sweet and sour veggie salad. The peanut sauce was a bit lacking in flavour.   Overall a very good meal"}
{"text":"This food is fresh, delicious and the real deal.  Amazing dishes, all authentic. Run by a husband and wife, small mom and pop place. My boyfriend and I get take out from here on a regular basis. They always give good customer service and truly care about the quality of the food that leaves their restaurant. Everything new item I order off the menu is always my new favorite! Watch out for the parking lot though, it;s a busy plaza,  can be a marathon just to get a spot."}
{"text":"Not very pleased with my overall experience here. To make it quick ordered here on Halloween, took a bit of time to order because of the language barrier but nothing to bad. The delivery man couldn't find are address in his gps so he called us to find the place. He was very friendly, even after being stuck in crummy traffic. Food was here in around 45 minutes. The food was fine. Nothing great but it was good (35/5) The prices of the food where more expensive then there menu online.   We tried ordering the same thing a couple days after & all of a sudden you have to order more money for them to deliver & they don't deliver to are area. The lady laughed because we said we ordered the same thing a couple days ago. Like what the hell? I will never order or eat here again. What a stupid way to try to run a business."}
{"text":"Initially I wanted to come here because I loved it when it was Thai Angels. It's been awhile and I realized owners changed (?) or got closed down. A bit sad because it's not the same.   Tried the Spicy Thai Noodles (vegetarian option) and the Thai Iced Tea for lunch. Unfortunately the lunch specials don't apply to the weekends, only from Monday to Friday. The noodles had good flavor and spice, I thought it tasted fresh but not the most amazing I've had. Thai Iced Tea was good though, it's almost impossible to get it wrong though right?   Aside from that, washrooms were clean and the overall restaurant smelled older (?). I think the decor is outdated and needs a refresher as the furniture looks worn out. Service was OK nothing to complain about. But, would I come back again? Maybe to try the lunch specials but I still like Thai Basil more."}
{"text":"In my tour of authentic pad thai restaurants, I chose Kinnaree Thai as my next stop due to its overall positive reviews and the fact I didn't have time to make it all the way down to Jatujak.  I ordered the pad thai chicken with spring roll, which also came with a veggie soup. The veggie soup came with a medley of vegetables such as carrots and broccoli, and overall tasted quite good. The pad thai also tasted very good for the price I paid, and the portions were generous as well. The spring roll was average, but since it came with the pad thai and wasn't a separate order I wasn't too bothered by it.  Service was below average during my whole stay. I had to wave down an employee each time I wanted someone to take my order, refill my tea, asking for my bill, or requesting change. If this was a Chinese restaurant I wouldn't mind much, but most of the Thai restuarants I've been to someone would always know to approach you for service.  Will I return? Possibly, as this is the only reputable Thai restaurant in the North Scarborough area to my knowledge."}
{"text":"I like the food, was really good.. service was good, the waitress didn't speak good English but it didn't bother me..  Would I go again? Yes..  Price was a bit high comparing to other good thia restaurants."}
{"text":"I was looking for a halal Thai restaurant and was excited to find this little place through Yelp. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai dish to go. Got home and started eating it to find it was quite dry and had a hard time breaking apart the noodles. It also didn't taste fresh at all. I have had really good Chicken Pad Thai but this was not good. Will I return? Probably not since the restaurant is far away from home and I won't be travelling to a place where I did not have good Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Traditional thai food at very reasonable prices.  Overall, the flavours are quite exceptional. But the quality isn't.  If you are looking for a high value place that can compete with your Thai Express craving, go here."}
{"text":"Delicious and flavorful food!  Portions are not huge but the quality is in every dish! A family run restaurant.  Quaint and eclectic decor.  Lunch time weekday 2 course specials available.   Dinner prices are a bit steep - 2 or 3 dish items could amount to $40.  Definitely worth cheeking out!"}
{"text":"Super friendly owners and amazing- deal dishes. If you're looking for a casual or dinner for gatherings, this is the place to go.  A hidden gem in Scaborough, this place should really get more customers. It's hidden in a small plaza, and you can easily miss it ; they don't have huge flashy signs to say 'Thai restaurant'.  This place is small and neat, nothing fancy compared with Linda's Modern Thai, so don't expect the atmosphere to be a 'wow' factor.   The tom yum soup was delicious, at least the two times when I came.  You will get your bang for your buck here, no doubt. I've seen a lot of people do take outs here so maybe that will be a good start for some. Keep in mind though it would'nt be as fresh."}
{"text":"100% thai. Not this watered down Chinese American Crispy Ginger chicken stuff.  Ive always had it as take out and its real quality food. The portions of chicken are also ample, not like other places."}
{"text":"Went with a couple of co-workers for lunch yesterday and had a good experience.  We started with mango salads and vegetable soup.  I would go back just for the mango salad alone.  The mangos were nice and ripe, which I prefer over the more firm and less sweet variety.  The portion of the salad was very generous given the fact that it was a starter that came with the lunch special.  It was very well seasoned and it was a very refreshing start to the meal.   The vegetable soup was well enjoyed by the other co-worker, but between the two, I would go with the salad.  We ordered a couple of pad thais and a red curry with chicken.  The pad thais were tasty and I did not taste any hints of ketchup.  It was a little wet to my liking but that's just my personal taste.  I prefer the version by Sukothai, but for Scarborough, Kinnaree is more than sufficient especially given the price.  The red curry was also pretty good but lacked a little heat.  My co-worker asked for extra spicy, but it had more of a sweeter taste to it than hot.  With that said, he finished his whole dish in less than 3 minutes, so I take it he liked it.  Service was attentive and our water glasses were filled without request and the owner(husband?) asked us how were were enjoying our food midway thorough our meal.  It's a small thing, but you'll be surprised how often patrons are ignored once the food arrives.  Seems like its a husband and wife run operation and they were very friendly.  Overall, it is another good lunch option in Scarborough and I will return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great little spot with authentic Thai food.  The server was pleasant and attentive and spoke English well. The restaurant was clean and quiet.  After ordering,  our food arrived promptly as did our free shrimp chips with peanut sauce.  I ordered the basil seafood which came full of seafood and lots of veggies. The basil sauce was spicy but didn't have too much heat and was very tasty.  My husband had shrimp with peanut sauce and it was delicious and tasted like coconut and peanuts.  I highly recommend this place, great value for the price and the food tasted very fresh.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"2.5 star  Came back to Kinnaree Thai for dinner and the whole experience was meh.  We ordered quite a few dish to share:  Papaya Salad ($7.95) - A-OK  Spicy Roasted Duck ($11.95) - pieces of duck was diced so small  Beef Masamaan ($11.95) - beef was so tough and dry  Stir Fried Glass Noodle ($9.95) - A-OK  The main problem was most of the dish lacked the taste of spices and herbs especially fresh herbs. Not surprising when I asked for some \"fresh\" Thai Chili, the waitress bluntly said they don't use fresh chili in any of their dishes.   What made Thai dishes unique is the complexity of taste (sweet, sour, salty and spicy) with the fresh aroma of herbs and Kinnaree Thai failed to delivered."}
{"text":"Got the chicken pad thai as takeout, it came with a small wedge of line and a thin half slice of orange.  While the shrimps were big, only 2-3 of them? Tofu, maybe 1-2 pieces? The chicken breast was a little overcooked, the noodles too.  For a dinner item that costed around $13, didn't feel it was worth it.  Definitely will come for lunch instead for better value.  The flavours were good, but the meal felt a bit like a rip off, even if it is authentic Thai food.  Wanted more bang for buck."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Lunch special prices are reasonable since it comes with spring roll and Mongo salad. Nicely decorated restaurant. Ordered cashew beef could not finish it not because it was too much but wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai restaurant. I love Kinnaree Thai!! The owners are really nice, it`s a family business and they`re always around to ask how you`re finding things and to chat for a bit. i`ve been twice so far now so I`ve had a chance to try out an assortment of their items. A total must-get item is their mango salad. i have not had a tastier mango salad anywhere else and I actually went to Salad King a week after my first visit to Kinnaree Thai and couldn`t help but compare the two. Salad King`s version is completely weak, boring and flavourless compared to this.   My 2 recommended items:  mango salad massaman curry"}
