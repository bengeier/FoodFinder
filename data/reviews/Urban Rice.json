{"text":"This place is fantastic! We live just down the road and this is our new go to Chinese food spot. And the best part is the dim sum that is always available!! They have all your basic items - It's perfect! Not to mention the service is great and the owner is the friendliest man. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The one in Kensington is not so good!
We bought a coupon from teambuy for dinner buffet for two.
The food was terrible. No dim sum, no ribs like it said on the website!
Just only oily noodle stir fry, tasteless fried rice, salty deep fried chicken!!!!
We wouldnt eat there if we didnt already paid for it.
When we were leaving My friend saw a guy who we thought he might be the owner took some spring rolls from the table that just left and put them back to the buffet!
Just so grossssssss!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to eat a Urban Rice with my wife. Their evening hours start at 5pm, and we arrived at 4:40. So we sat in the waiting area a little bit. Noticing us, the owner came by and told us to go ahead and come in, and that he'll take our order and serve us some tea himself!

We ordered off of the menu. My fried rice was delicious, no complaints there. My wife's order, Schezuan Beef with rice, was skimpy on the meat. It was mostly vegetables, and they were very large-cut, making it hard to eat and mix in with the rice. The portions were large. You get plenty of food, so it's worth the slightly above average price.

5 Stars for customer service, 3 stars for the veggie-heavy dish. Our waitress was okay, but the owner was very nice!"}
{"text":"Not closed. Moved.

Love this place. Moved to Kensington. East side of 10th Street NW. It is beside the Roasterie and a Thai restaurant, south of the Safeway. 

They make all their own dim sum dishes. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"For those who think the Regency and U & Me has awesome dim sum, you are clueless to what else is out there. Urban Rice is a small little place located in the plaza just off Centre and 3rd Ave. My parents took me here because I LOVE those deep fried taro dumplings (wu-gok) and this place apparently has the BEST wu-gok in town.

My first impressions walking in: no white people. Perfect.

I sat down and the menu was written in Chinese and English which was nice. We ordered a bunch of things including my favourites: shrimp dumplings, siu mai, beef rice \"crepe\" rolls, wu-gok, and I wanted to have some fish congee so we ordered that too. The congee was well flavoured and they we couldn't taste any MSG! If you go to a place like U & Me, you are sure to find MSG in almost everything. The shrimp dumplings were very hearty and flavourful. So was the siu mai. And the verdict on the wu-gok? The coating was very light, crispy and delicate. The taro portion wasn't too salty so you could taste some intense taro flavour. It was smooth and creamy and there was a perfectly sized portion of minced meat in the middle. Perfect. I don't think it could get any better than this.

For you foodies out there who love dim sum, please try this place. You won't find the novelty of the carts rolling around, and you won't find anything weird any unfamiliar. What you will get is some excellent dim sum that is not too salty, not too greasy, and you can order from the same menu as the Chinese speaking folk!

{"text":"Excellent dim sum. Order is by menu.
The service was extremely fast.  food is fresh and hot and they have a good selection. 
Super friendly owner and staff.
No lineups. :-)"}
{"text":"This review is for take out only but also on great service and smiles from the owner. Nice guy. When we popped in for a take out menu in Kensington while bootin` around, we were impressed with the inside of the restaurant. Large tables, lazy Susans on the table - seemed like a great place for groups. The owner mentioned that they serve great dim sum and that the place does get very busy. Not my cup of tea normally (dim sum) but we could not wait to order a couple of dishes! So we did! 
Singapore noodles - extra spicy which sadly was not spicy at all as the owner promised it would be - but the little container of chili oil really helped that came with the dish. Hubby got the chicken fried rice and I can say that it was some of the best Chinese food so far that we have had in Calgary. Was happy to find this little gem of a place and we will return!
If you grab a take out menu from here, get the coloured one as opposed to the black and white regular one (both in same basket) Coloured one has coupons inside."}
{"text":"Great little shop, nice dim sum, cheap $ 3.50 - $4 a plate, had 4 steamed shu mai (pork dumplings), 2 small sticky rice in leaf, 3  crsipy leek dumplings and pork short ribs in black bean sauce for $ 14 with tea

Flavour average

water glass was very well used, hard to tell if it was clean or not and some of the other parts of the restaurant a little \"well used\"."}
{"text":"I didn't feel like paying for the high priced lunches along Stephen Avenue, so I took a stroll into Chinatown. I eventually decided to pop into Urban Rice for lunch. It has a weird entrance, you have to go inside an indoor mall to get into the restaurant. 

Since I was in a totally new city I decided to try something different, so I scanned the menu for something unfamiliar and my eyes settled on a whole bunch of Congees - I never heard of the dish before, so I ordered a Mixed Meat Congee for about $5 and a Shrimp Dim Sum for $3.50.

The Dim Sum were fabulous- 4 feathery light dumplings chock full of multiple whole shrimps -what a great dish.

And as for the Congee, well it served me right to order something without knowing what it was. It was a bland bowl of soup that tasted like a \"Cream of Something\" hot cereal. I looked it up on Wikipedia,  and learned it's \"a type of rice porridge or gruel\".  Nicely said........ 

Somehow, the soup's description  didn't quite live up to the high expectations I would have had if I knew it was basically a bowl of gruel. It must be an acquired taste, because I didn't care much for it. The congee came with about 4 small shrimps, a few chicken strips, and some meat strips I would swear were liver.

Oh well, it's all good, and I apologize if I offended any congee lovers (or livers) out there. I'll never order that again.

Wandering around Chinatown was a fun experience, seeing all the Chinese bakeries and herbal medicine stores. And based upon the clientele in the restaurant I chose, it was also fun eating in what seemed to be a very authentic place... 

By the way, I really like Calgary a lot..."}
{"text":"As C.T. said Urban Rice is in the building that Double Greeting used to be in. It is in front right hand side of the first floor, where as Double Greeting was in the back. I am sure glad that I was not there the morning that Carol K was to possibly give her the wrong impression, as I am white. Like her when I am looking for a good dim sum place I want everyone else to be Asian and these customers were almost all seniors, so I was pretty sure my son and I were going to have some really good dim sum. All kidding aside I think I would enjoy eating dim sum with her as the wu-gok was really tasty. The baby octopus and curry squid were excellent, as were all the dumplings we had.. All the the chicken, shrimp, pork and vegetable dishes were fresh and nicely cooked, and the sauce for the chicken feet was delicious.."}
{"text":"It's a great little Chinese resto just off the beaten path that specializes in Dim Sum.  I've heard great things about it over the year they've been open, but never had the chance until recently.

Just like any Dim Sum place, they have all of the traditional foods, at reasonable downtown chinatown pricing, but also have special prices during the off hours as well.  Popular among diners in town, they also cook the food fresh to order as opposed to a mass prep which tends to lead to some dishes sitting around for ages.  The Haw Gow is nice and shrimp meaty, with a good texture to the tapioca  flour skin, and this is the measure of a dim sum resto the world over...  They go it right, and the rest are just as tasty and impressive.   found the taro fired pancakes a little too greasy, but still quite yummy.  My only complaint is that they don't seem to be able to season the rice porridges very well, as I found the century egg and pork one I ate, and the fish one my gal had were pretty bland in taste, and needed quite a jolt of salt to get it to some semblance of taste.

MEnus are in english and chinese, but it's nice to see that there wasn't a secret chinese menu as a lot of places in Chinatown sometimes do to offer dishes that might seem too alien for non-Chinese.  Every thing is there for everyone to trym and treats no one like some fearful tourist.

So overall, it rates a 4 and then some.  Decent price, nice and hot, good portions and so on, it's a great addition to the Dim Sum scene.  It's a tiny place btw, so finding it full during a Sat or Sun is really not all that hard."}
{"text":"Urban rice has a grand opening in Chinatown.  It's now located in the first location which housed the first Double Greetings.  If you know where Five Harvest Plaza, that's where the restaurant is.

It has a dim sum special priced at $3.25 and a lunch special noodles priced at $6.95.  There's also a poster advertising their Chinese dinner specials.

We had their dim sum thiis morning.  A little slow in their service but good dim sum nonetheless.  You order off their paper menu - written in Chinese and English."}
{"text":"I recently visited here for the first time and have to say I will definitely be back! We went with the dim sum and everything was very tasty, particularly the sticky rice. The food was served very quickly and all of the staff were exceptionally friendly. 
And to top it all off it was extremely well priced.

I recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here based on the Yelp rating at 10:30am just in time for dim sum.

Coming from Vancouver, this is going to be an interesting comparison.

At $3.50 this isn't bad.   The sizing of each dish was alright and the recommended taro dumpling was good.   Just disappointed I got 3 instead of the normal 4 taro dumplings in Vancouver.  Everything else is pretty much the same portions/sizing and way cheaper than in Vancouver.  The haw-gow wasn't bad and the beef balls were ok too.  What I really noticed about the beef balls was that it tasted like there was no MSG.    Actually, it taste like they don't use much MSG, if any, at all in all their dishes because everything tasted less salty than I'm used to (with the exception of the sausage in the rice wrap-but that's a pre-bought ingredient, the restaurant doesn't make it themselves.)

I was about to give this place three stars, but then I got the bill.  To my surprise, FORTUNE cookies!

Restaurants don't do that any more in Vancouver and I was pleasantly surprised.  So for Calgary's sake, I'm giving this 4 stars."}
