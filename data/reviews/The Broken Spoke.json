{"text":"Place is beautiful.. service was definitely not with a smile..or even friendliness at all..at least the 2 bartenders up stairs anyway.  I"}
{"text":"The single malt whisky brewed here is amazing, keep it neat if you can or at most on the rocks with a single, large ice cube. The pork belly tacos were good, not to my liking but I've had no prior experience with pork belly. Plenty of experience with single malt."}
{"text":"This place has a fabulous interior, but poor service from just one person has ruined it for us. We've been here once before and had a wonderful experience. However, the long haired bartender upstairs at the bar was very rude and unprofessional to my husband for no reason at all. We chose this location out of everywhere to spend St. Patrick's Day, as we live over thirty minutes out from the city. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Outstanding place! Excellent drinks and tasty small bites. Ordered charcuterie and paninis and devoured them!  Get the black pudding!"}
{"text":"I love their old fashions. I guess secretly I'm a 67 year old man deep down inside. Ambiance is relaxed, plenty of parking, and they serve beer, hard alcohol and some food. Great place to go if don't want to put in a lot of effort.  OMB is within walking distance, so is sugar creek brewery. So the area makes for a great Sunday funday."}
{"text":"Awesome, creative cocktails. Amazing food. Great service- the kind of people who remember your drink from two weeks ago. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Another one of my \"I don't want to share my special place with you\" places. Membership needed as with a handful of other really fun spots on the Queen City. Great small foods - generally Irish themed fare but standard wine bar style noms too. Fantastic service. Well executed cocktails. Nice whiskey list but I always end up with their signature drink the \"Broken Spoke\" made with GWR distillery's Rua. Distillery tours available regularly but I can't remember the schedule. LOVE the patio and the general location - strategically placed in between ONG and Sugar Creek. Well done Ollie!!  Parking can get tricky on peak happy hour day/times."}
{"text":"Service, food, and cocktails were all spectacular. If you're looking for a trifecta this is it. Awesome environment as well."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to The Broken Spoke. It is a distillery, but it feels like a speakeasy with the comfy seating and intimate living room feel. I had \"The Other Irish Coffee\" which became a favorite right away. They also have canned beer and beers on tap so make sure to ask for a beer list if cocktails aren't your thing. However, the real reason you go to The Broken Spoke is to drink great cocktails and catch up with friends while avoiding the loud \"I feel like I'm yelling\" atmosphere of any bar in Charlotte and most breweries."}
{"text":"Brought a group of business partners here for an evening. What a fantastic location. The food is great. The staff is friendly and inviting.   You MUST do the distillery tour!  I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"This place has a cool look, but falls short in so many aspects that i will not be back. We walked in tonight at 10:30, the bar was open until 11. Someone sitting at the bar yells at us that they're closed. My boyfriend looks to the manager, who laughs with the man at the bar, but then assures us they are still open. But then he proceeds to high five the man at the bar who yelled at us and goes to talk with him for a matter of minutes, which made us feel very uncomfortable. We sat down amongst several other people at the bar, so it's not like we were the ones keeping them open even if they chose to close early, and the Bartender said nothing to us. The bar was wet and dirty, and the bartender seemed apathetic and so unfriendly. He obviously could care less about his customers, and also showed that apathy while taking our order and during our whole interaction. The cocktail was pretty bad, especially for being $11. It not only did not taste good, but he poured a little bit of crushed ice on top of a room temperature cocktail without shaking or stirring it, so it was warm on the bottom where my straw hit the glass. They said nothing else to us after that, not even a have a nice night as we walked awkwardly out of the quiet bar and they obviously watched us go. Not to mention, there were still other people in the bar after we left, and we were gone by 10:45, before they even closed. The bar itself has potential, but their staff doesn't care about their customers or their cocktails and that ruined our experience so much that we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome atmosphere and great (though expensive) drink menu, especially if you love whiskey. However, the service we received has to be the WORST I've ever had at any restaurant or bar. As a former waitress, I tried to give the most leeway possible, but it was absolutely terrible service. It took 20+ minutes to get a drink from the server upstairs during a not-so-busy evening (for a friend's birthday). When the drinks arrived, half were incorrect. We could see her from our seats doing nothing/flirting with the other bartender behind the bar while we were waiting. Also, the food, while delicious, is served in completely pathetic portions. Other people in our party actually went next door to get food after seeing what we were served. I appreciate what this place is trying to do but the execution needs serious help for them to stick around."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm quite disappointed. Was encouraged by a friend to go here Friday night. I love the ambiance and really, I don't think Charlotte can ever have enough Irish places.  Drinks are quite pricey, but good and heavy pours, so I guess that balances out. My main issue is with the food and service. Out of the four of us that went, two got the shepards pie. It comes in a small, disposable foil pan. I guess Broken Spoke can't be bothered to wash dishes. Whatever. The Shepard's Pie had exactly two small, tough pieces of meat. Two. The rest was 80% gravy, 10% veggies and 10% mashed potatoes.  That is not a Shepard's Pie. I don't know what I would call that.  A muffin pan of gravy.  The mashed potatoes the waitress recommended tasted instant. We also got the potato pancakes as an appetizer. It was quite flavorless.  The other two friends remarked their food was unremarkable. I'll let them write their own reviews.  After my first drink was finished, the waitress was nowhere to be seen. It was early (7pm) on a Friday, it wasn't that busy. I walked to the bar. The bartender was fighting with his girlfriend in the backroom. Another waitress came and took my order (which was wrong). Had to ask for the check because the waitress wasn't following up on us.  The bill for 2 drinks, app and 2 pies was $75.  All in all, I might go back for a drink. Maybe?  But you can't pass that off as a Shepard's Pie in an Irish place. They should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"We pass this place often when visiting OMB, so we decided to check it out. It's a more sophisticated place with an older crowd. For a Saturday, it wasn't too crowded but definitely seemed popular. There was a large crowd around the main bar. We sat ourselves in a corner booth downstairs, but after 10 minutes of not being acknowledged by the server, we decided to go upstairs. Our experience was immediately turned around as Matt took great care of us! We sat and ordered promptly. Our drinks were made quickly and cheese board came out fairly soon after. The furniture is cozy and promotes a great sense of community and ease of talking when with a group. The cocktails were delish. The feisty margarita was perfectly spicy and well made. So good, I had two. The Carolina flight was a great sampler and the gin was our favorite. They have a great beer selection too. This isn't a cheap drink and fare place, but seemed reasonable for the location and craft. We will definitely be back with a group!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place for food, drink and fun. They make award winning whiskey and offer top shelf selections as well. Truly professional bartender makes a complete array of cocktails perfectly. Some of the beers are brewed across the street and are well worth sampling. The food is more than \"pub grub\" with home baked bread and toppings. Don't miss the smoked salmon. Leather couches and chairs upstairs and down add a special touch."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday at 6:30pm and it wasn't very crowded. We enjoyed the vibe they were trying to give off, mind the crying/screaming toddlers (please don't take your children to a place that's clearly for adults to unwind after a long week). The whiskey was great, the bartenders recommendations were spot on, and the food was pretty good too. We ordered the pork belly tacos and the shrimp cerviche for a pre-dinner snack and it was plenty! It's a pretty cool place to hang out for a couple drinks."}
{"text":"The Broken Spoke is such a fun spot - and a shining light in the midst of many breweries as someone who prefers liquor to beer.  The space itself is beautiful. It has huge windows letting in tons of natural light and a very relaxed atmosphere with comfortable chairs and couches inside. They have a nice big bar that always has at least 3 people behind it attending to anyone who needs a drink. They also have tables outside, which is great.  Their menu is always changing and the knowledgeable, kind bartenders are always happy to help walk you through it. They have both dark and light liquors. Their drinks are inventive without being too outlandish, and the prices aren't too bad - $10-13/drink. They have trivia and an open mic during the week as well.  They do serve food but I haven't had a chance to sample it yet. Next time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are Bourbon enthusiasts, and when I saw that Mecklenburg county has a whisky distillery, who was celebrating their second anniversary last night with a throw back to Prohibition-style Speakeasy's, I thought, \"I'm in!\"  We arrived just before 7pm and the place was already hopping.  I enjoyed role-playing and having to knock on a side-door to gain entrance to the candlelit walk to the tour.   We never actually saw or got a tour, which was a bummer.  We did sort of get to taste one of the four Spirits they were highlighting. My poor husband was given a glass with barely enough whiskey in it for even one tiny sip.  It certainly wasn't enough to truly appreciate the the flavors one usually looks for when sampling a whiskey.  I was given enough for both of us, so I shared my little sampler with him.  Since there was nothing else to see in this area, we headed upstairs to the bar for a craft cocktail.  Here we found two bartenders working their hardest to fill orders, clearly understaffed and overwhelmed.  I wondered if I had just unknowingly entered a \"Stress Test\" for an episode of Bar Rescue.  We sat at the bar, all the while watching as these poor ladies struggled to make customers happy.  Appetizers were delivered from the kitchen incorrectly which meant one of the bartenders had to leave to go to the kitchen to correct the order.  That left one person to fill orders as the lines backed up. What a disaster!   I will say this....  when we finally got our drinks, there were quite delicious. I would have ordered a second, and maybe some food, but there were no menus to be found, and after what we experienced, it wasn't worth the effort.    Maybe The Broken Spoke is used to a younger, less demanding crowd?  As I whispered to my husband, the place was crawling with Millennials.  I'm not a hater, but I honestly felt over-dressed, over-age, and I was literally over-it, so we left before the band even started to play.  I would have paid a higher cover charge for a more intimate event with better planning and better service.  No plans to go back.  Ever."}
{"text":"The delicious Rua whiskey was smooth and delicious! My mom tried the whiskey, hot water, lemon and cloves--called something like a piscine. She liked the lemons/cloves w/ whiskey. We sat on the porch and enjoyed the sunshine. I will return to try the small plates & movie night."}
{"text":"Our real estate team held a launch party for our new brand this past Saturday night at the broken spoke. We cannot speak highly enough about this venue. The location is absolutely gorgeous especially at night once all the lights have come on in the candles are lit. The bartenders were super friendly and the drinks were amazing. We worked with Katie to set up the event and she was so friendly and easy to work with. We can absolutely see ourselves holding another event here in the future! If there was any negative at all to mention it's just that the parking is a little bit limited. I would definitely tell your guests to show up a little bit early to make sure they get a parking space even if it means they have to hang out downstairs and have a drink at the bar before they come up to your party."}
{"text":"Broken Spoke is one of my favorite places in Charlotte, and I don't even drink whisky. This is the perfect place to go If you're looking for a low key date night, or to just hang out and feel classy. The environment is very relaxing and open, with high ceilings and a number of comfy chairs to sit in. The upstairs is my favorite part of the place (when it's not booked for an event) as it has a number of cozy seating sections ideal for a group of 6-8. My boyfriend is a whisky drinker and loves the Broken Spoke drink - I think the huge ice cube looks cool. The charcuterie board is amazing and full of stuff, so you definitely get your money's worth.  My go-to drink is usually the grapefruit mule, although I believe they just changed the recipe and it's not as good as it used to be, but that could've been a one off, and it was still really good. Basically, if you're looking for something off the beaten path of the regular uptown/south end scene, this is definitely a cool place to check out!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday night at around 11pm . The place was 80% full in the bottom bar section. The two bartenders were attentive though somewhat stoic. I had the Irish whiskey flight and my daughter's boyfriend had the bourbon flight. I thought a nice selection for the $16 price point. I think the bourbon may have been $18 or vice versa. We didn't have any food so no comment on that. My wife had a white wine and my daughter a RUA cocktail. The drinks were fine. It was maybe because spirit quaffers tend to be a tad serious but the vibe was a bit stiff and quiet. Maybe it was the time or more likely the crowd but we had our flights and left. I tend to get comfortable when Uber is readily available but I didn't get the inner gnome call to stay a while."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place I have ever been.  Great Beer from a brewery down the road and the single malt whisky from the onsite distillery is the best I have ever had.  The proprietor Ollie is a native Irishman and one of the nicest people I have ever met.  It is a pleasure to find great places like this."}
{"text":"Ahhh... the smell of whisky in the air and a variation of whisky tastings. Pure bliss. Perhaps because it was around the holidays that I stumbled across this venue, but it was amazing. Our waitress was kind, bubbly and very accommodating. We added people to our party and it wasn't a problem. It is located near OMB in case you want variety, but well worth your uber drive people!  My favorite whisky bar in Charlotte so far! Now... can I get an Old Fashion please?"}
{"text":"Damn good julep! Fun staff and a fabulous staff! Love that it is on this side of town! Nice addition when all the breweries start to run together it breaks them up."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment twice now. Each time the staff has been so helpful and pleasant. They always teach me about the drink I've ordered and go into a bit of history. What a fun and enjoyable distillery. Their food is also wonderful, we order the charcuterie board. It was comprised of delicious local meat, cheese, and goodies. My favorite drinks so far are the Quinns sour and the Quinn's Sazerac. I highly recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"Fun place. Staff very friendly and have a lot of knowledge about their spirits. Prices are fair. The distillery tours was interesting. Lots of room to meet people and hang out. Great location. There's several other bars to hop around to."}
{"text":"Broken Spoke has a great vibe and even better drinks. I had a margarita that was spicy and I loved it. Felt unique and the price was understandable. After that I drank vodka sodas and they were fairly priced and actually pretty cheap. Loved the vibe inside. Later in the night, a band set up. We moved upstairs to avoid the loudness but it turned out the band was a soft jazz and was perfect for the place. Upstairs has a lounge vibe and still a bar."}
{"text":"Nice rustic modern feel to the place; and love the christmas tree right now which gives it a festive feel.  Room for groups to push some tables together as well as casual lounge seating.   The drinks run on the sweet side, but generally our group liked them.  Important to note:  they don't take reservations and there is a $1 lifetime membership that is charged at the door (but it can also be added to your tab)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but after multiple comments of \"this isn't a sports bar\" as we were cheering for the NFL  playoff game they were showing on a projector, and saying \"have you ever had a martini?\" after asking about an ingredient in a drink. And also after a bartender asking me what can I get you, I replied the beer I wanted he asked me 3x's before I realized he was waiting for a please. I didn't feel comfortable especially after paying 7+ per drink. Sugar creek or broken spoke.. you pick?!"}
{"text":"I went here on a weeknight with some friends to catch up.  It was the perfect location, we had our choice of seats, excellent food and excellent drinks.  From my first visit, I knew I had to order the Broken Spoke, their signature drink.  It definitely lived up to my expectations.  I hadn't eaten dinner, so I grabbed their potato soup in a bread bowl.  It came out very quickly and the soup was delicious.  The bread bowl was a bit hard to eat because it was so crusty, but I definitely got out all of the bread possible.  The only issue came when I had to check out to leave - we had 6 or 7 people there who all came & left at different times.   I was one of the last to get my check and it ended up being 40-some dollars!  For soup and a drink, I definitely wasn't expecting that.  I double checked that everyone else in our group had paid (and they had), so they agreed to void that transaction and charge me for only what I had.  All was good & well until l found that I had both charges on my credit card bill!  The manager was very prompt in responding to my inquiry via their contact us on their website, so it all ended up square in the end.  I really want to not recommend this place, so it can stay my little secret... but then I guess I shouldn't be reviewing it on yelp..."}
{"text":"Two visits and I like The Broken Spoke.  I like the entire area with all the distillers popping up in what may have seemed like another industrial park doomed for the bulldozer.  I'm in.  On a Saturday evening it was standing room only.  We each ordered promptly a drink, and stayed only a short while.  I'm getting too old to stand around and attempt to talk over the noise.  Came back on a Wednesday night--which happens to be $1.00 off bourbon drinks--landed at the bar and ordered an Old Fashioned.  Ahhh.  I think the prices are fair for crafted cocktails (unlike $5 well drinks served during happy hours at Uptown haunts--yuck).  I loved watching the bartender gently muddle a cube of brown sugar into house-made bitters with a splash of water until syrupy.  Drop in a block-size ice cube, squeeze a peel of orange, fill with small batch RUA Whiskey, and top with a proper Maraschino cherry and I'm a happy camper.  My only criticism is that RUA Single Malt Whiskey, like all the local distilleries, needs something that eludes them:  time.  Time in a bottle, that is, like Jim Croce crooned.  I know the inventory is being built, but until they can pour 10, 12, 15 or 18 year old stuff, the subtle complexities have not arrived--yet.    I think they are off to a great start, however, so I say bottoms up, and \"give 'em a whirl!\"  Support our local craftsmen and risk-takers."}
{"text":"The Broken Spoke is the new kid on the block. I'm a fan because in a sea of breweries, this is a distillery. My first beverage of choice is not beer and my husband doesn't drink beer at all so when we decided to rent a 15 passenger van and have him drive our friends around on a brewery tour, this place was 2nd on the schedule.  We actually hit this place up earlier this week as well not realizing they had not even had their grand opening yet. Here is what you get when you are there; a full bar, local brews from nearby breweries, a good looking menu (the couple next to me had some good looking pickled veggies in a jar to go with their sandwiches and fresh loaf of bread) and a cozy seating area. There is also a long bar that seats about 15. I don't think Saturday afternoon they had all the stools there but its quite accommodating. They have an upstairs too but I never went up there. The bartender told me there is a large 72 in screen upstairs. They play old movies on it and the TV over the downstairs bar during the day/night.  On the first visit I ordered the flight of their booze . There are four on the tasting board. Three are theirs and one is from another NC distiller. Two were white and two were aged. Not bad.  When I went this past weekend, I got a vodka soda with fresh grapefruit juice, They have a mule with grapefruit juice too so just know that when you go, there is a cocktail list as well as beer. I think wine too.  I would like to go back to snack on some stuff one day soon."}
{"text":"This place has some serious potential but hey aren't quite living up to it! They have a distillery right next door and they highlight those liquors in their cocktails but they could have so much fun with those spirits instead they only have 8 cocktails in their list. Several of the cocktails lack creativity as well. Then there's the food menu which I think they shouldn't even both with it because it's only a few tapas that are mostly shrimp. They were out of the sausage balls and with such a tiny menu there's no reason to be out of something. Then there's the wine list which only has 2 reds and 3 whites! Overall they are just way to limited!   This could be a cool place to hang out with friends but I hope they make some changes. They have been open for a year and should have some of these kinks worked out.   Wagon Flight and Shrimp dip were ok. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This is the coolest place I've ever been. Great drinks, great bartenders, great people, great vibes. We went there on a Wednesday for open mic and it was incredible. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. My phone died after 1/2 of the \"last song jam\" with all the open mic performers but I will post it on the broken spoke page. Incredible!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't what I expected. You have to go to bar for everything. Very very small wine list for serving cheese plates :( We came here just for the cheese boards. What little food is on the menu is AMAZING! Food gets 5 stars, atmosphere gets 5 stars but the service and setup gets 3 stars.  We were told a server would come get our food order. Waited 10 minutes then finally went upstairs to the bar.  Food was great but if you want to get cozy on a couch....good luck having a bartender come to your table. Went on a Saturday night before it got crowded around 9pm"}
{"text":"This establishment has a very inviting atmosphere. There are very comfortable sofas, chairs and benches. This is a huge place with an upstairs area as well. The bar is beautiful. This has a totally different vibe than the brewery feel. When I was there there were no dogs or small children.  The cocktails were unusual and very tasty.  My favorite drink was the spiced rum with almond milk, vanilla and something else that was yummy in it. The wait staff were great and informative. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"St. Patrick day and the menu states $5 Guinness but they charged me $12. When I asked why. She walked away.   This is after waiting for  15 minuets with 6 bartenders. Stay at OMB or Queen City social."}
{"text":"Situated between OMB and Sugar Creek, I stumbled upon the Broken Spoke with a group of friends this weekend. It's next door is the Great Wagon Distillery, which also opened at the beginning of 2016. Most importantly, the Broken Spoke will serve the vodka and whiskey the distillery makes soon! This is an awesome because in NC you can't drink at the distilleries. SCORE! What a smart idea!   When you walk into the Broken Spoke you experience a modern-romantic feel. The lights are very industrial looking and some of the chandeliers were made from beer bottles. How cool! There are two stories, both that feature bars. The downstairs is loaded with tables with candlelight and the upstairs offers huge couches and nice seating areas to hang out with friends.   Like I mentioned, they will eventually have vodka and whiskey from Great Wagon, but for now they offer a variety of local beers (omb, sugar creek, three spirits to name a few) and a full bar. The beers are a little more expensive than the other breweries ($6-$7), but the hard liquor seemed to be priced well ($5.5-$8).   Coming soon they will be serving food such as tapas so this will definitely be a place on my radar! The staff was also very friendly and spoke very highly of the bar-all 15 employees ;-)"}
{"text":"Having a Dirty Martini in a small champagne glass at a cocktail bar just doesn't feel right.  Such a great space to be underwhelmed by the drink presentation both in feel and pour size.  The taste however was spot on  The beer selection is good with something for most.  The bar staff had a good vibe and very helpful...will try again soon."}
{"text":"The only reason for the 3/5 is for the service...  When walking in we were told we had to pay $1 for a lifetime membership (call it what it is a cover charge) by a very persnickety hostess who than told us to \"sit anywhere\".  Only a few chairs at the bar so we opted for a table next to the bar.   Our server was darling!  Though not versed in the food specials she knew her beverages (but being a bar I gave her a pass).   The selection for a whiskey bar was really poor - basically any avid whiskey drinker would have selection in their home stash!  The mixed drinks were however really well made and tasted great.   The food selection was austere and what we ordered was okay. They need a bigger menu (sandwiches need to come with a side other than pickles) with variety! For the cost of our meal we got a poor selection of drink, food and so so atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you're a whiskey or vodka fan. These are made in house and are such good quality for a decent price. They of course have beer, wine and other liquors as well. They serve appetizers and small plates that are delicious and just enough to snack on.   The interior has an industrial, vintage vibe with plenty of seating at the bars, tables and comfy couches upstairs. They also have patio seating out front. As for the actual distillery, it is located right next door and is open for free tours.   The location is perfect, seated right between OMB and Sugar Creek Brewery right outside of Southend. Perfect for day drinking between the places, for a nicer evening out, or for any kind of celebration. Very cute date spot too!"}
{"text":"Interesting that I was there on the same night as another person who gave a 2 star review.  I had planned a special event for 2/17/18 a month in advance, and was nervous when I learned it was the same night as their anniversary party.  But everything went really well!  We were there from 6:00pm-9:30pm.  Other than a small mix-up by the hostess when we first arrived, the staff was very attentive and professional despite an obviously busy night.  My group was seated in a reserved area upstairs which was unexpected but really helped - much quieter up there.  The food and drinks were outstanding.  There were 2 female bartenders upstairs and they were incredible - they worked so hard and were still friendly and made it look easy.  Another staff member went out of her way to help with my birthday cake by getting me extra plates, a knife, and a lighter.  My friends had a great time (we're an over 40 years old crowd) and I appreciate the efforts of the Broken Spoke team.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Broken Spoke now three times and have always had a great time. The most recent visit was on NYE with my wife and two other friends. We were admittedly a little nervous about the potential for crowds, but we arrived early enough and were able to secure a table upstairs.   The atmosphere is always cozy with either house music or some live jazz or folk going on downstairs. The bartenders are friendly and always patient with questions and requests. The drinks themselves are delicious - can't beat a solid Old Fashioned - and their craft beer offerings are wide-ranging.   Definitely a good alternative if you're hoping to avoid a normal sports bar, club, or the brewery scene, and looking for a solid adult bev."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and even better drink selections. Don't let the exterior fool you. Inside you'll find a casual yet sophisticated design."}
{"text":"Really neat space. The sofas and chairs are spaced in a way that makes you feel at home. Only you have bartenders making really cool drinks. I have been here twice and enjoyed the atmosphere both times. On my latest outing, we had an area reserved for our party. They rent an area on the 2nd floor. The bartender was nice and greeted me upon arrival. At times he was super busy and not able to keep up. A bit disappointing since the space had been reserved, but when he got overwhelmed, others came to assist him. It was really busy and the whole place was crowded. They have a small food menu, however, I didn't order anything either time. They also have an outdoor patio and do tours of the distillery. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This was a first time here and I went with my parents and a friend of mine that was visiting for Thanksgiving. I found this place out when we were at Midwood Smokehouse BBQ the night before and decided to try out some of the local liquors. We saw that there was a moonshine that was created here, so we definitely wanted to check it out. I live in Knoxville, and well, there's a lot of moonshine so I wanted to see what the difference was in comparison. We really enjoyed the Poutine that the Broken Spoke made so we definitely decided to just come and check out the distillery.  So, we came for a nice tour and a tasting, and it definitely was worth it. We ended up buying 4 bottles, and we were surprised that the bottle was not a top seller! Inside the Broken Spoke, they have a huge bar and a full menu of drinks that you can get. Plenty of seating and it really was bright with natural light. I thought it was very cozy, and they definitely were set up that way as there was plenty of Holiday decorations and that next to the fireplace type of feeling.   Overall, a free tasting as well as a free tour of the operation was absolutely great. I'm happy to see that Charlotte is growing in the alcohol scene, not only in the beer market, but also now in the liquors. I think it's great and something to be proud of when I say that a liquor came from my hometown. If you haven't been here, or tried any of Broken Spoke's liquors, I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The drinks are overpriced but you can't beat the ambiance. Such a cool bar! If it were slightly cheaper, I'd be there a lot more often"}
{"text":"Waiting 35 minutes for food was terrible.  As much as I want this place to be great, three bad customer service experiences have lead me to believe they are still getting their bearings. I appreciate the food comp, but even looking at the general bill that were comping makes me wonder how you can justify a $12 sandwich with four pickled carrots and consider that a side or a good value.   Considering it's the monopoly for food in this area(OMB only offers full menu inside and Sugar Creek is a sandwich place) if they don't shape up in the next few months, the LOSO will get better restaurants to compliment the breweries and broken spoke will be forgotten."}
{"text":"The broken spoke was hardly a place to go for a meal. The decor was nice with an Irish feel, but honestly the acoustics made it impossible not to be flooded with sound. This is not much of a place for conversation, but maybe enjoy the live jazz they have. There are drinks on special, but they might cost you an arm and a leg. Very  $$$$. Still if one has an admiration to try different whiskeys and expensive scotches then a flight at the spoke is well worth it, but maybe the only reason to visit."}
{"text":"Loved it! We managed to snag a parking spot in their lot even though it seemed packed. That was just because everyone was huddled in the doorway waiting to sign in and pay their $1 for the \"private club\" entry fee. At 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon it was full but not overwhelmingly so, and we were able to grab seats at the bar downstairs. I loved how light and airy everything felt, and the downstairs bar was beautiful with the light-wood grain. I also loved that, as a non-beer drinker, there was a full bar in the middle of brewery town. I got a couple of signature cocktails, the fella and I split the North Carolina whisky/vodka flight, and the fella got a couple of local beers. Service was spot-on, drinks were great, and the atmosphere was relaxed and cozy. We eventually moved upstairs for a change of pace and loved the comfy chairs and couches up there. Awesome addition to this part of town!"}
{"text":"The Broken Spoke is a beautiful new spot to meet friends, grab a snack, and imbibe on cocktails/drinks. When you walk in you, it is almost like you walked into your own living room, if your living room is full of comfy leather couches and a well stocked bar. I like that there is an upstairs and downstairs area both with their own bar. It would make for a great event space! I ordered the charcuterie and namesake drink and both were to my liking. The cocktails can get pricey, so beware!"}
{"text":"What an awesome find! - this bar features 3 spirits created next door at the Great Wagon Road distillery.  Ample/versatile seating, great tunes, and overall relaxed classy vibe. I had \"the broken spoke\" cocktail - this used the Rúa Single Malt from GWR - it was deliciously smooth."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars!!  The Broken Spoke is a bar attached to the Great Wagon Road (GWR) distillery.  GWR is considered the oldest distillery in Mecklenberg County (Charlotte, North Carolina).  Their focus is on best spirits and local brews with some Irish hospitality.  Vodka and whiskey are distilled at GWR distillery next door.  I stopped by for drinks and tried the following 2: - The Broken Spoke - GWR Rua Single Malt, Amaro Montenegro, Benedictine, Orange Zest - Grapefruit Mule - GWR Vodka, Ginger Beer, Lime, Grapefruit with Rosemary  There are also other offerings such as Drinks of the Month, Drinks for Sundays at Noon, Liquer Flight Tastings, Beers on Tap, and Wine!  I loved their atmosphere!!  Cool lights and leather couches!!  I would definitely like to come back when I'm in the area again.    Tip - You have to sign in at the guestbook before entering into the bar!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while in town for business on a Thursday evening. Friendly staff, very welcoming, and good live music. I highly recommend a glass or three of Quinn's, their Carolina Whiskey!"}
{"text":"A great spot!  Festively decorated for the holiday.  Loved their unique cocktail options.    Had the Beesies Bread - unique and not too sweet.  Also the grapefruit mule which was very refreshing.  Bar service was good.  Space was cozy, though acoustics were a little loud.  We had the cheese plate and the charcuterie- both were tasty.  The deviled eggs were good too (though not as good as The Asbury from last nights dinner!)"}
{"text":"Went here for a networking event. Very nice place. Pay $1 for lifetime membership.   Seems to be an older crowd -40s+."}
{"text":"Nice new spot in town. Open mic night on Wednesday was fun. Due to state law you gotta be a \"member\" which means you sign in and pay a dollar at the door. Try the meat or veggie curry pies."}
{"text":"Order the Broken Spoke from the Broken Spoke and you can't go wrong.  It delicious.  All of the whiskey and whiskey based drinks come with a giant square ice cube.  It's legit.  The bartenders seem a step above most.  Classy and Knowledgeable.   It's not often a place charges you 13 bucks for a drink and you feel like they did you a favor.    Also the GWR whiskey over ice is great as well."}
{"text":"We went this past weekend and this was the 2nd time in a very long time due to our past experience and this time was amazing. The meat and cheese board out of this world, sausage salad seemed a little odd but it worked. The old fashion I had was great and my wife's cocktails were so yummy she said. Service was incredible and I can tell management has changed here cause everyone around us were having a good time and the staff you could tell are enjoying working there."}
{"text":"The Broken Spoke is such a great place. With two levels (main bar area downstairs, sofas and conversation group seating, along with a second bar, upstairs), there's definitely a spot that will fit your needs for an evening out. I love how everything is arranged for conversation, and the furniture is really comfy and classy. I really loved the ambiance overall. The owner, Ollie, paid very close attention to every detail, and it shows in every element of what he does, from the light fixtures to the fact that his ice cubes use the same spring water as his alcohol.   The drink list is outstanding. The Broken Spoke offers flights of whisky, mixed drinks (many made with the products The Great Wagon Road Distilling Company makes right next door, but they also serve other great NC products like Doc Porter's) that are fantastic, and craft beer.   The food is also great. The best thing I have had so far was their corned beef and cabbage for St. Patty's Day. It was the best I've ever had. Their sandwiches are also very good, and the food menu seems to change regularly. Everything is worth a try, methinks.  The Broken Spoke is constantly evolving, and they have recently added a patio area, regular live music performances, movie nights, craft beer tap takeovers, and more. I loved it when they first opened, and I love it more and more as it changes.   In short, I will be back regularly. I'm pretty sure this is my place."}
{"text":"Great ambience here with cool lighting. We went to the upstairs bar.  Service was super slow. Bartender took forever to make 4 drinks.  It was just 7pm and not overly busy.  We stood and watched him. I did the spirits flight that they brew. They were great!  The bourbon and Rum were excellent. Even the vodka was excellent and I do not even drink vodka!  Great place; however, lots of food left on tables for our whole time in the building. Apparently not enough folks to clean tables or they just didn't care.  Upstairs needs help with faster bartenders.  Cool place with huge possibilities. Not there yet."}
{"text":"SUPER cute. Love the decor. The only drawback was that it took about 45 mins to get a simple appetizer - and we were the only people in there. It would be fun for them to have board games and coffee in the beautiful upstairs area."}
{"text":"I am a true fan....and I'm not really a bourbon drinker to boot!  So yes, I prefer beer but I also prefer to have incredibly great spaces to have drinks in.   This is where Broken Spoke seals the deal for me.  The interiors....the interiors!  Specifically a fan of the second level.  Large leather couches, chairs and love seats.  I really couldn't have designed a more manly, chill and warm space than the one here.  Add to that, they have a second bar and also serve up there then we are all set in my opinion.  Parking will be a challenge I imagine because of the popularity of the area but this place is worth it to me.  They have local drafts on tap which suit my just fine and also have some great cocktail concoctions if you so desire.  The one and only drawback I would have is the acoustics.  The night I visited they had a band and the sound travel right up to the second level to the extent it made it a little difficult to carry a conversation and this place was made for just that....conversations.  Fix that, and forever in love."}
{"text":"My boyfriend threw me my 30th birthday at the bar,  they let us rent out the whole top level and they let us bring in \"fake\" blackjack tables for my party.  Let me tell you I had a ton of friends there yelling as we were playing,  and we were pretty loud but they did not mind at all.  They were great.  They had awesome service and everyone was super nice.  The drinks were great and we all had a blast.  It was a great place to have a group of friends there"}
{"text":"We reserved the upper mezzanine for a business event with ~20 of our UK colleagues. The group thoroughly enjoyed the venue, craft cocktails and beer!  We used the Broken Spoke catering for appetizers and dinner and the food was great! In addition, our bartender/ servers were very attentive and friendly . We also toured the distillery and enjoyed a sample! I initially thought our UK colleagues would require a more formal setting, but all seemed to enjoy the evening and their time at the Broken Spoke! I would definitely recommend the Broken Spoke for an informal group event! Thank you to Katie, Constance and Ollie!"}
{"text":"This trendy whiskey and craft beer bar is just steps from Olde Mecklenburg and Sugar Creek breweries in South End, and serves up a great selection of local taps in addition to its own distilled libations. But on the night we visited, the music in the balcony was WAY too loud to allow for conversation, and the performer kept screeching his way through a bad set of 80's tunes. Unless you're a whiskey drinker (or want something other than craft beer), the two breweries on either side of Broken Spoke are far better choices."}
{"text":"Went here on a business trip on a Wednesday at 5. Very welcoming bartender and staff. They do not brew beer but they do distill vodka and whisky ( dangerous for a Wednesday at 5). Great venue and selection on brews. The kind of place you could easily get lost in for a few hours."}
{"text":"Great bites, flights, and live music.  Lindol and Lauren are a dynamic duo behind the bar. Their flagship whiskey was amazing and was like nothing i ever had before."}
{"text":"Tried The Broken Spoke for the first time on New Years Eve -- admittedly a gamble with the potential for crazy crowds -- and am so excited we went. This is definitely one of my new favorite spots in Charlotte.  First off, The Broken Spoke wasn't insanely packed as expected - got there around 8:30 pm and easily grabbed a table and four comfortable leather chairs upstairs, score! The environment was festively decorated for the holidays and a live jazz band added an extra-fun, classy touch to ring in the new year.   I tried the Grapefruit Mule first, which was delicious with the sprig of rosemary to top it off. The Figurine Tonic served as as my round 2 beverage, which was very unique - definitely a slow-sipper and very seasonal with the fig preserves. I recommend both!  Reading through other reviews, I'm really looking forward to coming back on a non-holiday for a distillery tour and to try another creative cocktail."}
{"text":"First, the pros... Amazing drinks in a beautiful building. I happily drank 3 Conniption Fits (made with vodka instead of gin because I think gin tastes like a Christmas tree) while chatting with friends on the comfortable couches downstairs.   Unfortunately, there were a few cons that I'm hoping they'll work out in time...   Service was incredibly slow. On arrival, we sought out our own menus, snagging a few from the bar. Then, after waiting 5+ minutes at our table with no signs of a server, we had to ask a busboy to get our waiter so we could order drinks. The first round took about 10 minutes to arrive. In fact, the food we ordered beat the drinks out. The second round took even longer. The third round took almost 20 minutes to get and we actually had to order twice -- I think our waiter must have forgotten to ring it in the first time.   The food left a lot to be desired, too. The charcuterie board was $14 and nothing special. The Kerrygold Butter was the highlight but sadly there wasn't enough bread to use up all of it. The salmon on soda bread was better but still didn't wow anyone.   So, to recap... The drinks get 5-stars, service 1-star and food 3-stars. Because I really want this place to do well, I'll land at 3-stars with this review and go back soon for another visit in hopes the service and food improves! I may try to sit at the bar next time to have a direct line to the bartenders."}
{"text":"This was such a cute place! We went for drinks - ended up just ordering beer. Can't wait to go back and try the food and cocktails"}
{"text":"Hot & New!!! I love this place!!! I attended a Yelp event. It's conveniently located near Old Mecklenburg Brewery. Very easy to find, parking is pretty convenient. Of course, if your going out consider carpooling. The side street parking will fill up fast.   I love the ambiance here! The decor has an industrial, modern look. During the event, we had the honor and privilege of meeting the owner Mr. Ollie. He gave us a tour of the distillery. After the tour we sampled a few appetizers and beverages--Be sure to order the Drunken Mule. So refreshing! On Sunday's mimosas are on special for $6 I think, the bartenders use freshly squeezed orange juice!   The event was held upstairs, REALLY nice area for a private space! Lounge couches and a private bar which is well stocked with local brews from nearby breweries. It's nice to know there's no competition. All the local breweries support one another. I'm looking forward to coming here more often. Summer's coming!!! I shall return"}
{"text":"Love the specialty cocktails they have!  The vibe is super cool!  Oh and they have a working phone booth, you can't beat that!!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere. I came here once on a Tuesday for jazz night, which really set the mood. We ordered the pork belly sliders, the kale salad, and the Cuban sandwich. I would say the Cuban sandwich was the best thing we had, as the rest was a little underwhelming. I came back a few days later and they were charging a membership fee. They take your ID and put all the info in their iPad, which was a little uneasy but it's so they can store your membership in their system for life. Didn't order any food this time. We only stayed about 10 minutes to wish a friend a happy birthday. Would come back mostly for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Wheel, as a whisky aficianada; I'm a fan.  Lendel is a wry treat at the bar.  No, you can't buy more than one bottle per year directly from the store and only after a tour as a souvenir and after they scan your license - thank you #NCABC #STATEOFNC for saving us from ourselves? #bottomlines.   I had discovered Rua whisky at another bar and had already purchased it for my home bar.  I'm so excited that Charlotte has this great distiller and I know Rua holds up to finer Irish Whisky's such as Powers Gold and Knappogue Castle.  I tried the Quinn which has quite the bite and imho better suited to a mixed drink.    And so... The menu seems solid from a tapas/shared plate view.  Good choice of meats, etc... Tho nothing tried at this first visit.  *UPDATE* On a 2nd visit tried the Sausage Rolls!  They were very tasty, although the little chunks of sausage kept falling out and made it messier than it needed to be.  The dilled mustard dipping sauce was really good.  Lounge seating for the most part.  Probably quite crowded at busy times.  Nice long bar. Try all of their offerings, 2 (or 3?) whisky's, 1 vodka first and then move on if you must.  Quite special on the libation scene in Charlotte.  I recommend the small box of Rua whisky European-style chocolate cordials for a take-home treat.  Looking forward to many happy returns (by Uber) ;).   I wrote this same review for gwrd and wanted to make sure I covered both bases."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. The \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" description is a bit over the top, but we enjoyed our time spent at TBS. Albeit, a quiet Sunday it was a relaxed and laid back experience a day after their one year anniversary. The staff was pleasant and easy to talk to ...  It is hard to tell the atmosphere since it was a slow Sunday, but I could imagine it being an older crowd and it seems management is perfectly fine with that. It doesn't seem like a place I would visit on a regular basis.  I don't seek out fancy cocktails but the two we tried were tasty. I feel they are priced high, but I guess that's why they would have an older customer base. We did not try any of the food items. It's crazy they have to buy their own liquor to from an ABC store, but sadly that's how north Carolina rolls....  All in all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Just walking in to this place makes me so very happy! I really enjoy the industrial decor with an upscale feel. I have a particular fancy for the lighting fixtures and the Irish telephone booth! Upstairs leads you to a charming loft with comfortable lounging chairs.   The drinks are pricey but it's because the whiskey is distilled by the owner, the ice is made from the owners very own mountain spring, and every ingredient is top shelf and fresh. Each drink is an unusual concoction but somehow tastes amazing. I think it just may be the best whiskey I have ever partaken of.   I tasted three wonderful libations. The signature drink is called the broken spoke and it goes down soooo smooth and warm. The Grapefruit mule was the kind of drink that hits the spot just the right way. Finally the conniption fit which was a drink that is perfectly refreshing after a hot day.   I think this is a great place to take friends from out of town. Also, the place is on the same road as two breweries and a ciderworks is being constructed as well. Just a tip: make sure to bring $1 to pay your \"one time membership\" fee. They have this because of some weird NC law, but it's worth it! I did not have any food but was assured by friends that it is all fantastic! Please come check out this hip bar."}
{"text":"Great hang out place and drink selection. Staff is a lot of fun and service is excellent"}
{"text":"Sleek, sophisticated, and sexy. I love to order a drink and then sink back into one of the gorgeous leather couches.   First of all, by law a distillery can't serve drinks in North Carolina. So, Ollie opened up this spot next door to Great Wagon Road so he could. Genius. Freaking genius. Insert slow clap here.  I think all of Great Wagon's spirits are high quality. On top of that, they also serve other liquors (including local spirits), beer, and wine. I am not a huge old fashioned fan, but I always order their take on it when I'm here: the Broken Spoke.   They have a food menu. It's not huge, but it is very well done. I always get a board of some sort when I'm here.   Nice little patio area, but again, it's pretty hard to get me away from those leather couches. Warning: this place is in the same area as OMB and Sugar Creek, so parking can sometimes get a little crazy."}
{"text":"I do NOT like whiskey, so this five star review is a big deal.  I really appreciate Broken Spoke because they serve their own Great Wagon Road Distillery vodka and whiskey. It's nice to have quality local products, and I've had several friends rave over the GWR Rua (it's one of my go to housewarming/birthday/Christmas presents!).   Even though I don't like whiskey at all, I adore Broken Spoke's Irish Margarita. It's made with their clear whiskey, and I swear I can't taste it! It's absolutely delicious and is one of my favorite cocktails in Charlotte.  In addition to the top notch drinks, I like the interior design at Broken Spoke. The bartenders are all extremely professional and knowledgeable, and you feel like you're getting five star service while there."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. It is located near Queen Park Social and Sycamore Brewey therefore the parking was limited. It was pouring down raining and the last thing I wanted to do was look for parking. Thankfully, someone was leaving in a spot near front when I arrived. I went on a Friday night to meet friend's for a drink. The atmosphere is between a bar and a lounge. The bar area was very busy which is to be expected on a Friday. I ordered the special a New York Sour. I absolutely loved it. The $6 special made it hard not order two.    Pros: -The lamb burger sliders were perfection. I was sad there were only 3 in a order. - Loved the lounge vibe - Delicious Drinks  - Great Food   Cons: It is located next to several breweries so parking is a pain   I loved this place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great libations.  Indoor/outdoor seating.  The seating inside is bi-level and their stuff at the bar, or in a more communal, common area.    I am a big fan of Moscow mules, so decided to get their version of it (using red grapefruit and their house made ginger beer on tap)-it didn't disappoint.    Their distillery is attached and I think (during daytime hours, or potentially early in the evening, they do tours, which is neat.    The staff is friendly, tonight there is live music, and the decor/ambience is pretty awesome, so if I were you, I'd definitely join the \"club\" (online-you can do it from your phone same day, and it just cost $1 to join), and swing on by..."}
{"text":"Charlotte has a new upscale bar attached to the Great Wagon Road Distillery. It's considered a \"members only\" club, so have your driver's license and a dollar bill for your membership fee. Inside are two floors with beautiful white oak bars, plenty of cushy chairs and sofas and a unique drink menu. The three spirits distilled by owner Ollie Mulligan of County Kildare, Ireland are Rua, a single malt whiskey, Ban (white in Gaelic) vodka and Drumlish, a 100 proof moonshine. The charcuterie tray is a perfect pairing with a flight of whiskey or Scotch, or enjoy a Panini or the soup of the day in a bread bowl. An expanded food menu is coming soon. The Broken Spoke is beautiful, vibrant and friendly. You will feel at home and relaxed while sipping your favorite spirit, wine or beer. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The Broken Spoke is a hidden gem, in between OMB Brewery and Sugar Creek Brewery. I thought this was just a distillery, but it surprised me as a full bar with small plates/tapas.  I went in there with my girlfriends to have a few cocktails and a cheese plate, and was blown away by how rustic, but romantic the inside is. I like the concept of having the place set up like a living room, with plush chairs and couches for seating, and smaller end tables and trunks as a place to set your cocktails. They also have gorgeous low lighting, and tea light candles spread throughout to give it more of the intimate atmosphere.   We tried the Carolina Flight, which consisted of their distilled liquors (a whiskey, a vodka, a liquor that resembles a moonshine, and a local spiced rum). I can't say that I loved everything on the flight, but I was excited to try what they had to offer; the vodka was my favorite, with the spiced rum coming close to that. The cheese plate had a variety of unique cheeses, pickled veggies, and bread, and it was the perfect size for an afternoon snack. As I was reading over the menu, I noticed that they had live jazz on Tuesdays; this caught my attention as my husband and I love jazz music, so I brought him that same night.  At night, the place was a lot busier, but not so crowded that it didn't feel cozy and intimate. At night, you can see the beauty of the inside, lit up by dozens of small flickering candles. I recommended their Carolina Flight to him, and I stuck with their Tuesday night drink special: $6/glasses of wine (I tried their Pinot Noir and Malbec). The live jazz duo was very talented, and the sound wasn't too loud-great acoustics inside. We learned that on Friday nights, the jazz duo increases to a full live band, so we are excited to check it out soon! This is definitely going to be a fav local hot spot of our's!  Pros: The atmosphere and the talented live jazz music. The servers/bartenders are super friendly and attentive.  Cons: Can be a little on the pricey side, depending on what you order. Definitely take advantage of their drink special nights. Also, they close at 11pm, like the other bars in that area, so if you are a late-starter or night-owl, plan on going out afterwards!"}
{"text":"I went for drinks with a friend one night and it was a great experience. Knowledgeable and pleasant bartender, great atmosphere, good food and drinks. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My mister is a beer guy, and his love for beer is well suited with the numerous breweries in Charlotte. There are many times though when I just simply want something else. The Broken Spoke is our place for that something else, and is frankly unparalleled in the area.   Let's start with the venue itself. Gorgeous building with cool light fixtures and other decor and a range of seating options. I am definitely partial to the upstairs area as it is well appointed for a spot to just hang out and relax.   The cocktails. Oh man, the cocktails. Whether it's a Rua on the rocks or a signature Broken Spoke, there is so much care and attention to detail with the drinks. For example, using ice cubes from a North Carolina mountain spring, which is also the same water used to cut the whiskey during the distilling process. It is impressive. I recently tried one of their Bloody Mary's. Wow. Literally, the best one that I've ever had. I'm still trying to deconstruct the ingredients in it.  Lastly, the food. The Broken Spoke is not a restaurant per se, but more in the style of a gastropub. You'll find charcuterie boards, sandwiches, and the like. I tried the barbecue sandwich the last time we were there, and it was delicious. The meat was so tender and the sauce was awesome too."}
{"text":"On a whim we dropped in and So Glad we did!! Nice on the inside, great selection of cocktails and they also have beer and wine.  Had some tapas (shrimp tapas) and they were delicious!  Patio/outdoor seating is nice and great for Saturday day drinking.  Wine by the glass is a tad pricey and is limited to only Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and prossecco when it comes to white wine.  No biggie though!!   Enjoyed our time here!"}
{"text":"Took my family on Saturday. Very cool place. They brew and serve their own spirits. Be careful with the moonshine. Whew! Very nice and informative staff. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome! They use mostly their own distilled liquors for all of their cocktails. Which taste fantastic. The space looks very inviting. You can tell it's brand new. Mary is a great bartender."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and great food! We got the Broken Spoke cocktail (similar to an old fashioned) and it was one of my favorite cocktails. The single large ice cube it is served with is a nice touch. We also got the duck crostini and the sausage rolls were were absolutely delicious. The drinks are pricey, but they are definitely worth it. I'll definitely be coming back to sample more cocktails and appetizers! There were many more that I was interested in trying."}
{"text":"A group of girlfriends and I came in on a weeknight for some much needed catching up.   The environment was a very calm but still steady customer flow for the night. I cannot speak for how it is on weekends, but the environment this night was perfect for conversing. There were several groups of regulars that were there, some very quiet, some not so quiet. The lighting is dim and comfortable, the seating is absolutely amazing for a great lounge vibe. It was half price bottle of wine night and the bartenders were so sweet and helpful. They guided us to the Chenin, which was outstanding. The bar was kept in tact and spotless.   They have small bites, your perfect lounge and small bite options for drinking. The girls all had a wide selection: charcuterie, prosciutto, etc. Being a vegan, I was able to get the Brussels sprouts by omitting a few things. They were still delicious!   I would definitely go back! I find this place extremely charming. One of my friends was even talking about how perfect it would be for a wedding event.   Clean, courteous, great drink selections!"}
{"text":"I personally think I have a future in the bottle dipping business. Watch out, Maker's Mark, I'm a-comin' for ya.   What a cool place to hang out. I love the feel of the two different floors, I love the mixed drinks, I adore the Rua and the Drumlish (white whisky). Here with a group of friends for the Quinn's release, the place was crowded, but not overbearingly so. I ordered an old fashioned with the Drumlish to start off, followed by a Rua on the Rocks. My friends love the vodka, but I really haven't tried much of it to form an opinion. The drinks are on the more expensive side, but if you go over and see Great Wagon Road's distillery, you'll understand where the price comes from. It's really well made, and the story behind each of the spirits in so fun. Kinda makes you want to go into the moonshine business.  Neat things: They have a great space for live music. They have a phone booth that actually does make free calls to Ireland. I have pics. It happened. The tours are free, quick, include tastings, and the ability to purchase and hand wax-dip and seal a bottle. I couldn't resist doing this, It's just too good.  The only thing that I have to complain about was a bartender upstairs...His head was down the entire time while making drinks, and I went over to just ask if tabs downstairs transfer to tabs upstairs (the answer is yes, by the way). I started off asking, and three words into my sentence with his head still down making a drink, he cut me off and went \"Hold on, I'm doing something.\" Not the nicest thing in the world. But I'm not one to let one grumpy bartender ruin this place's reputation for me :)"}
{"text":"I wish we had a bar like this in the city I reside in, but alas, I have to travel for any form of entertainment and adventure. My group came here for the distillery tour (which was free that day!!!), and since we arrived rather early, decided to sit, grab some food, and enjoy the space. The bartender was very friendly. He told us that we can place our order and it will be delivered to our table. We placed an order for buffalo pizza, and picked a spot to sit. It is quite spacious, relaxing, and overall comfortable. A very, very chilled environment. The leather seating that wraps around one side of the bar was very comfortable and we almost didn't want to move since we've spent the day on our feet. We then notice that there was a second level, which made it a bit cooler to us. There was a private event going on. Somehow that large crowd didn't disturb the space down below. We gotten the pizza pretty quickly and were surprised that it wasn't a typical pie. Instead it was a rectangluar shape and had celery on it. Despite all of that, it was very delicious. We ate it super quick amd almost ordered a 2nd one. However, it was close to time for the tour. I have this place bookmarked so I can visit it again when I have more free time when I'm in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"The Broken Spoke offers a great cocktail menu with several small plates appetizers. The atmosphere is very inviting and I love the couches throughout.  On a recent visit, we were able to grab seats at the bar, service was slow as usual and I definitely wasn't impressed with the ceviche we ordered. Overall, I do love the atmosphere and drinks but wish their food lived up to the expectations."}
{"text":"After a couple stops, I havent really decided if I love it or if i like it. This last time I was there I found the service to be pretty slow, even taking into account that these are hand crafted cocktails that take some time. The first time I was there I remember the drinks being very very good and this time they were very average. I was pleased to see that children were not allowed and that rule was even enforced. I dont hate kids, but I hate drinking with kids. We had the charcutarie plate and the sausages and both were pretty good! Ill certainly be back, in hopes that its as much fun as I remember the first time I was there."}
{"text":"Wow! I just got a full description on every shot in my flight by Maria! She is amazing! The manager showed us the distillery with so much knowledge as well. This is a must see!"}
{"text":"Finally a whiskey joint in joint in the Queen City! The moment you walk in you know you will feel like Don Draper in Mad Men. Leather couches, phone booths, suspenders, the whole nine. I recommend their signature cocktails. Specifically the spiced rum one! It's made with almond milk and is the perfect beverage for after dinner. This place is perfect for big groups or small intimate meetings. And they have food!!! The Irish themed establishment offers familiar named whiskeys and their house made whiskey too! They offer craft beer and wine so there is something for everyone.  They require a membership so get that dollar bill ready if you go. Only one membership card is needed per group. It's within walking distance of other CLT breweries if you want to hit a few places in a day. Cheers to broken spoke!"}
{"text":"Cool space, lots of room for large groups. I was disappointed that the cocktails were not well-made. They were a little watered down. We didn't try any snacks. The ambiance is really cool with a refurbished old factory feeling and loungy furniture."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for some day drinking and cocktails. They have a few beers on tap including some locals and some from a little further away. I enjoyed my Wicked Weed Lunatic Blonde and OMB Captain Jack. The cheese plate was very nicely done and the mustard was excellent.  They brew their own spirits here. The vodka was excellent.  Nice spot to sit with chairs here and there in smaller and slightly larger groups. A neat hangout if you're looking for something other than simply beer from one of the great local breweries."}
{"text":"Goodness, this is a gem in Charlotte. I went to the Broken Spoke to celebrate New Year's Eve and it did not disappoint. My boodle and I arrived with two other friends around 8:30pm. We were concerned it would be too packed to get in at that point, but we were pleasantly surprised by how quickly we were in and served.   They had a $5 cover, which I wasn't thrilled about, but it beats the hundred-dollar tickets being sold by other establishments. The Broken Spoke was beautifully decorated for the holidays with a really really tall Christmas tree. There was a jazz band setting up, and we grabbed our drinks and went upstairs to the more lounge-y area. I love sitting upstairs because of the really nice, soft, comfortable leather seating. We were able to grab a small table and 4 seats. There is a bar upstairs, and tabs from downstairs DO transfer. DING DING DING! We didn't have to go back down to get drinks! My go-to is the grapefruit mule. They use fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice and the rosemary sprig adds great flavor. All their cocktails are made with fresh ingredients. We ended up leaving just before midnight, but I loved spending my NYE here with dear friends and a few of the grapefruit mules.    I will note the bartenders were extremely friendly. There is plenty of parking near the Broken Spoke. Their restrooms were trendy and clean."}
{"text":"This is the only distillery I've been to, but I find it very interesting! I can't tell you whether the whiskey is good (since I'm not knowledgeable); however, I enjoy drinking it! I've been twice now. \"The Broken Spoke\" is a bar/venue where \"Great Wagon Road\" can serve the alcohol they make. The lounge has a nice, chill setting. Not overall formal, but not casual like a brewery. Since the ratio of food/alcohol sales is low, they are considered a private club, and you have to buy a $1 membership to enter.  If you're interested in learning about distilleries, their tour is very interesting and makes you appreciate it more. They make three different types of spirits - vodka, an aged whiskey, and a white (non-aged) whiskey. You can taste each at the end of the tour...let's just say it's not like wine tasting :) A little bit on the stronger side!"}
{"text":"So different! Visited after a day of brewery touring and this was a breath of fresh air. Gorgeous interior and lovely seating. Friendly staff and exquisite mixed drinks. They even have beer and wine for non liquor drinkers. Located conveniently across from OMB as well."}
{"text":"Upon entering, we weren't greeted by staff, only abruptly told to sign in (there was a book on a table at the entrance), and then we just assumed we should seat ourselves.  Nobody said anything and nobody came to the table, so we again, assumed we just needed to go to the bar to place any order.   My friend ordered a draught beer and I tried their Irish Margarita, featuring a whiskey they make next door.  It was beautifully made and tasted absolutely amazing.  The bourbon soaked cherry was so good, I would order a side of them if it was on the menu.  I would 100% recommend it.  The pork belly sliders, however, not so much.  The aioli didn't taste like much other than mayo, the pork belly seemed a little dry and I didn't love the cucumber with it.  I think it was meant to add a bit of complexity and crunch to the bite, but I wasn't thrilled with the selection.  Cucumber isn't one of my go-to veggies when cooking, however, so I may be a bit biased.  My friend's pork belly Cuban was DELICIOUS, however.  Everything went very well together, and the slight sweetness from the relish was perfect.  I also ordered the Grapefruit Mule, and it was tasty also.  It was refreshing and juicy, almost like a summertime punch.   The environment is really nice and you can tell they spent time to try to make the venue very welcoming.  They were having an open mic night, so toward the end of our time, there was some live music.  Overall, the service was okay, the food was 50/50 and the drinks were phenomenal.  The staff ended up winning me over by the end of our time there, but I will admit I wasn't at all impressed by the lack of a welcoming attitude when we entered, and not informing us that we needed to go to the bar to order.  We would've ended just sitting there, wondering where our server was."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! It was busy but not TOO busy and the whiskey was really good! It's a distillery so they make their own in house. They also have a lot of beers from OMB next door. I liked it but it has this... Club snootiness air about it."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks for a friend's birthday. The bartender's were fast and efficient. Since this place is connected to a distillery they even have their own vodkas and whiskeys to taste. Their food selection is minimal due to their recent opening. Eat before you come and enjoy the drinks! Try your favorite cocktail with their alcohol."}
{"text":"Great Wagon Road Distilling Co. is one of Charlottes only distilleries. It is the oldest distillery in Mecklenburg County. The Broken Spoke is the bar associated with the distillery, the first of its kind in North Carolina.   We had:  Grapefruit Mule: GWR vodka, ginger beer, lime, grapefruit and topped with a spring of rosemary   Quinn's Manhattan: GWR Quinn's barrel-rested poitín, vermouth and bitters with a a whiskey soaked cherry.   Both drinks were amazing--beautifully made and tasted fantastic. Price was typical for craft cocktails in Charlotte. The fact that they were made with local liquor just increases the enjoyment factor.   The atmosphere is casual and classy. The bar itself is beautiful and the decor is very industrial modern with wood finishes."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick evening cocktail and ended up staying for a quick bite. The cocktails were spot on and while it was a soft opening the service was nice and attentive (Granted there was only a handful of folks there). It's great to have a local distillery to help diversify the seemingly endless breweries in town. The food menu may be short but they executed the sandwiches perfectly.   We will definitely be frequenting this establish when it is fully up and running, and look forward to checking out the distillery operation when that is open."}
{"text":"Never been so we stopped in. Ordered at the bar. The upstairs was closed for a private party, bummer. The people at the bar before us were eating and drinking and left a huge mess for the staff to clean up. I don't get people. Do you leave crap all over the countertop at home!? Gross. Quit being slobs.   Our drinks were good. Mixed well and the bartendress made them with a smile. We sat in the corner because the bar was slammed.   We enjoyed our drinks for about 10 minutes and then in came the party of 8 'ladies' who went on to talk about how loud they could belch and fart. Again, gross. 20 somethings. Never in my life have I ever wanted to speak about something so disgusting. Your mama would be proud,,, then again maybe she would be. You take your lead from your parents and the company you keep.   We left as it wasn't our speed. We prefer low key, on the quiet side and don't need to listen to drunk people try to teach their drunk friend how to play piano as loudly as they possibly can. This could be a very neat place. The decor certainly is. The patrons... some of them leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We came for a Pop-Up brunch this morning and later decided we had to try one of the craft cocktails. Not only were the cocktails great (minus the Spiced Rum Punch...not that it was bad, just not what we expected...we were thinking of a Rum Runner and this came as a milky-type, spicy drink), the bartenders are wonderful and staff friendly. The atmosphere is fantastic. Definitely try this out...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think this is a great idea. Put a cool place, with lots of seating, big leather couches, etc, right between 2 major breweries. You already have a great crowd being drawn to this area, and you offer something slightly different to beer. They have their own distilled liquor here, and some nice one of kind drinks. The atmosphere is really nice. Food is limited, but they do have a few options. They also have beer, although I think the reason to come here is to have something other than beer. It was pretty crowded when I was there, but we enjoyed the time spent with friends."}
{"text":"Five stars across the board for me! The broken spoke has been bookmarked on my yelp list for quite sometime now. So my sister and i decided to go yesterday since apparently it was on both of our list. Still excited and thinking about my experience after leaving i was already planning my next visit.  Where to start. The outlay here is very modern,sleek and unique, the one thing that stood out to me was the lighting in the very high vaulted ceilings. The leather couches is a nice touch as well, i almost feel like this could be a cigar lounge  as well which would not be a bad idea. We wanted to go check out the upstairs area but couldn't because apparently someone rented it out for a private party, i believe they use that area mostly for private events so you have to catch them when their is nothing going on upstairs.  Food you say? Oh yea and shout out to our waiter/bartender Mark he was super nice! My sister ordered the deluxe grilled cheese sandwich and i had the Irish Empanada .No complaints over here. When my sister ordered a grilled cheese sandwich i thought she was nuts but that was the best grilled cheese sandwich i have tasted in my life! Actually im plotting on going back just for that grilled cheese. My empanada was good and i loved the presentation of it as well, it wasn't very filling. When i told my sister mines wasn't very filling her response was well i don't think the goal here is to get full its to get drunk its a distillery lol. Well  there you have it. Swished all of this good food down with a grapefruit mule which was quite refreshing.  Exciting part of the evening was we participated in the free distillery tour. Sammy our tour guide was very informative and i learned alot of new things about alcohol and beer i never knew. He answered any questions anyone may have had, the others on the tour with us were super friendly and some funny. It was nothing but good laughs on our tour. Towards the end sammy sampled a combination of vodkas,moonshine, and whiskey, i was done after 2. He sold me on the bottle of ban vodka, im never able to drink vodka by itself but this bottle of vodka was very smooth , my sister and i both purchased a bottle. Thanks for the experience because it was definitely one. Welp ill be spending my entire summer here i think !"}
