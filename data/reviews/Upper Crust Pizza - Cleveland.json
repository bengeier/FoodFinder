{"text":"This eatery is in Cleveland and it has fantastic food!  I am very picky with my food but I have tried everything on their menu and all of it was very good.  From their pizza's to their subsandwiches.  They have GOLDEN CRISPY BONE-IN CHICKEN and wings.  The breading is light and very tasteful- not too hot but with a great flavor.  You can have any kind of sauce you want and you will be satisfied.  Try it today.  They deliver and you can eat there!"}
{"text":"Think Pizza Hut style pizza.  If that's what you like than this will be pretty good.  If you like the newer brick-oven style, or New York style than you should probably order elsewhere.  Its really that simple.  I ordered from the new Lakewood location assuming every place that opens in Lakewood is the new-vogue hipster style neopolitan pizza- this is not the case.  It's not bad, I'm just posting so people have a better idea what it's like."}
{"text":"Been a loyal customer to Upper Crust for years. I used this company to cater for our company a few times. 

Come to find out that the business was recently sold to new owners. Ordered our first pizza and was told it would be done in 30 mins. I arrived around 40 mins later to pick up. Guy behind the counter (beleive he may of been the owner) was utterly rude. Politely asked how much longer it would be. He first and only response \"don't know. Haven't put the pizza in the oven yet.  If you don't want it leave\". To say I was shocked is an understatement. Should of taken the previous person who walked out yelling something as a sign. 

Oddly enough I would go thru this every time because the pizza us just that good. One of my favorites. Get home and take my first bite. Recipe has completely changed.  Now tastes like similar pizza chains. Not bad by any means but definitely not the Upper Crust I've grown to love over the years.  

As mentioned above, I'd deal with the rude and disgusting behavior if the recipie was the same. I'm a gluten foe punishment I know. If in want this new pizza they make I will just go to one of the local pizza chains. The thousand or so we spend a year on catering will go to a more deserving,  polite and respectful company. 

Wish things where the way they used to be instead of watching poor ownership run a long standing business into the ground.

Would of given them 1 star but I have to be fair. The pizza wasn't the same but it wasn't awful either."}
{"text":"Fast service, reasonably priced and great tasting food! I ordered the pizza fries for lunch, they were done in less than ten minutes and were absolutely amazing. They were worth every calorie! Very clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"The worst place ever, we ordered a thin crust and we got bread instead of pizza. Besides that we got a very cold pizza afte 1:30 minutes that we placed the order. And angry manger delivered the pizza complaining he has not a delivery guy.... shame on the costumer service, we will never order from them. We use to like this place but not worth it..."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from Uppercrust since the early 80's.  They've recently changed ownership, and the pizza is no longer what I grew up on... example : They use to use fresh mushrooms. Now, they use mushrooms from a jar. The sauce isn't the same either. Once was a great authentic pizza has now gone commercial.  Disgusting... I will never go there again! Thanks for screwing up over 40 years of great food!"}
{"text":"I've been going to uppercrust for my whole life and I guess the old owners sold the company to new owners who simply suck. The whole meal I usually get has been totally changed. My dinner that once included steak fries now only includes two fries. The customer service was the worst I've seen in years. Food took 20 minutes longer than what they said it would. Horrible horrible horrible!!!!! I will never ever be coming back! I'm so upset I miss the old owners! Honestly they don't even deserve one star!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and staff but the pizza it self is close to DOG FOOD. NO WAY. NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"From Detroit, visiting Cleveland, staying at the La Quinta Inn down the road. Went here to get a pizza to take back to the hotel. Worst pizza i've ever had ...even after smoking a joint!"}
{"text":"Ordered one pizza for pickup. When I arrived to pick up the pizza they ignored me for a few minutes. When they finally came to the counter they told me it wasn't made. I told them I'd come back and returned home because I only live a few streets over. Not to mention the workers behind the counters were placing toppings on the pizza without gloves. I then called to see if they could deliver it because of the inconvenience. I explained the situation to the first person who answered the phone, they told me they would get their manager but suddenly they \"accidentally\" hung up on me. I called back and finally got the manager on the phone, Steve or Steven was his name. I simply asked if we could have our pizza delivered because the pizza wasn't even made at the time we were told to come get it. He told me they wouldn't be able to because their drivers were too busy. At the time I called they were still open and still taking orders for delivery. The fact that they couldn't simply deliver the pizza after making a mistake is unacceptable. I will never order from this establishment again. I work in the customer service industry and never have I seen a guest treated to this degree."}
{"text":"Tried Uppercrust for the first time tonight.  Not bad.  Much better than I was expecting, actually, but that's because I was keeping my expectations pretty low.  My wife and I both agree that the sauce could use work, but we liked the flavor of the crust and especially liked the cheese.  We got a thin crust and I would've liked it crispier (it was so soggy we had to choose between eating it with a fork or rolling it up to take a bite).  The ingredients were about average quality and maybe slightly below average in quantity.  I'm glad we ordered a thin crust because had there been more dough the small amounts of each topping would've really been a real issue.  The onions were a disappointment; they're diced into teensy squares, maybe 1/8\" each, and could hardly be tasted at all.

We got a large with 3 full toppings and 2 half toppings, so I guess you'd say four total toppings.  $17 plus $1.75 for delivery.  Not a great price, not terrible, but I'd want more and better topping ingredients to add another star.  The woman who took our order was friendly and efficient and the pie arrived well within her predicted timeframe."}
{"text":"We will not ever eat here again. We love the food here but the service is horrible.  I ordered and recvd chicken Parmesan upside down and leaked all over our chicken dinner.  Next time no drinks were delivered and we waited nearly 2 hours. The last time is what put me over the edge, I picked it up and no salads were in the dinners.  I called and was told I Would have to pick them up.  Unhappy but I did.  got home and there were no dressings.  Manager offered me 5 dollars off our next order. I found this insulting and was expected to hike up there a third time for dressings...I called manager back and voiced how irritated and poor the service was.  In. The end he offered us a credit In full for a repeat order of Chicken Parmesan and. 2, 4 piece chicken dinners.  I accepted this.  Tonight I Called to  redeem this and was told by whoever answered the phone the manager on duty would not honor this credit.  He was too busy to me to the phone and would not even speak to me.  Piss poor to say the least.  So many great little eateries go out of business due to not enough customers and this excuse for a manager is throwing customers away.  So be it word of mouth will do you in and the owners can blame the management.  Beware.......F rating"}
{"text":"This place is touch and go... Really seems to depend on who's making the food, maybe? Can't recommend the pizza; lackluster sauces and crust. More hype than flavor. Hit Marco's if you want a specialty pizza or Patino's for NY style. Uppercrust does have a hot Italian sub that's usually awesome. Double check your order before you leave, have had a couple mistakes made."}
{"text":"UPPERCRUST IS  MY NUMBER ONE PIZZA SPOT. I moved to the area about 2 years ago and have been going here ever sense. Yes the did change a lot of things but if you ask them to do something like the old style they will arrange it for you. I always order the meat lovers pizza, with the BMG wings (buffalo mild garlic) and all my guest love it ."}
{"text":"What can I say except Delish!! We ordered a pepperoni pizza while working in the area. I was pleasantly surprised when the pizza arrived and there was cheese, sauce, and toppings covering the entire surface with a perfectly crusty edge around it. Mozzarella sticks were average, but the pizza left me wishing that there was an Upper Crust location on the east side!!"}
{"text":"Puritas, Ohio at 8:30 on a Sunday night actually yields quite a few options. I was being picky but, when I rolled by this place and its dark interior with creepy silhouettes, I just had to try it out.
The place was hot as shit. They had a big fan blaring, but it did nothing for the rest of the restaurant. Obviously related people sat around and watched me come in. The woman at the counter smiled and said hi.
I scanned the menu. It was pretty much what the sign said it would be: pizza, subs, sandwiches and salads. When I saw \"pizza burger,\" I really couldn't resist that.
She popped it in the oven and we all watched the home makeover show. To go was assumed, I guess.
In my experience, a pizza burger is usually a hamburger with mozzarella and marinara. Uppercrust's, however, was a sausage patty (not a burger, mind you) between two slices of pizza. Weird? Yeah, a little bit. It was about $5 though and ended up being pretty good.
The sauce was nice, the crust tasted okay. I don't know that this is mind-blowing pizza, but it certainly tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin.  My frustration originally started with the fact that their Lakewood location was open for business.  I get there to find out they are not open yet....  Ok fine, maybe Google screwed up it happens.  

So I call this location and placed my order.  I was very specific about the fact that one of the pizzas had be whole wheat crust.... I was assured it would be, I also ordered a regular pizza as well....  I also paid upwards of $34.00 for two MEDIUM pizzas....  I got home and was immediately disappointed.   I regret not taking pics because it was the most unappetizing pizza I've ever seen in my life.

The crust was not even close to whole wheat, I was in the pizza business for several years and know a pre made crust when I see one.  It was burnt on the outside yet raw in the center.  My pizza was still a doughy raw mess in the center.  Keep in mind I paid $34.00 for this alleged pizza.  But this still isn't my biggest problem with this debacle....  it was when I called to complain.  I got \"Jim\" on the phone.  If I had to grade for customer service he would have received an F and shown the door.

I ATTEMPTED to tell him the problem.  He rudely interrupted me and told me \" well it sounds like you've written us off and that you're not going to use us again right?\"  To that I took a moment to answer since I was taken very off guard by the reaction, I said yes he was correct.... \" then I'll refund your transaction and we'll call it a night, how's about that? Have a good night!\"

Granted I got my $$$ back ok fine.  Really though?  Upper Crust must make a killing if they're able to treat their customers this shitty.  Not only will I never use them again, I will be sure to tell EVERYONE that I know how this experience was and to never order from them.

Did I happen to mention this my FIRST time I ordered from there?  I hope their new Lakewood location fails miserably and crashes right out of the gate."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent and the women who run it are super nice.  It's a simple place and I wouldn't dine there, but I really like the food."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place only has two and a half stars.  I ordered the Five meat treat large pizza. I was quoted 45 mins. The pizza showed up in 35 mins.  The pizza was absolutely amazing. The amount of toppings was unbelievable.  The cheese was gooey goodness. The crust had this perfect crunch to it.  What else can I say. I really was that good."}
{"text":"After ordering from this place for months they suddenly called me back 45 minutes after ordering delivery and told us that they no longer delivered to us. We are only 1 mile away right off puritas where they are located. Poor service. We will no longer be eating here."}
{"text":"Rude! Rude! Rude! When I walked in the older woman that was working there saw me but still walked to the back. I asked if they took debit cards she says \"yeah\" than proceeded to snatch the card out of my hand. When I got my card back she says \"what's wrong with you today, you crabby or something\" told her I would be writing a review on yelp and her tune changed saying \"I didn't even do anything\" I can spend money elsewhere with better food and service. Too many options in CLEVELAND."}
{"text":"I am never ordering from this location again. I made an order almost an hour ago through Skip The Dishes, and the courier has been there for almost a half hour. I called to ask what the hold up is, the person on the other line said they are new and the manager just left them there to learn how to make the food. If that doesn't scream \"poor management and training,\" I don't know what does. When you place new people in those kinds of positions where they shouldn't be, it makes for bad customer service as well. Go to the Lakewood one instead."}
{"text":"Tried it because it was new in Lakewood. Really disappointing. I ordered online and it was late, and was smooshed to one side. Very greasy pan style pizza. If that's what you like, maybe this is good to you. Plenty of great pizza in Lakewood to choose from. This isn't close to being in the top 10."}
{"text":"I had a 2-star problem it was courteously corrected and the food was tasty. My family did not complain, so neither will I."}
