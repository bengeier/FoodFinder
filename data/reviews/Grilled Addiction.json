{"text":"We visited this food trucked tonight on a recommendation from our neighbors. We both had the tri tip sandwich. They were grilled to perfection. The rub and the smoke flavor were delicious. The owners were friendly and helpful.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"After reading some of these reviews I feel the need to add mine. I have eaten at Grilled Addiction many times. They set up at my apartment complex once a month and I LOVE THEM!! I have had everything on the menu and it has all been fantastic. Kiarash Z - if you want fast food go to a fast food restaurant! Don't review something if you havent tried or been there. Fail. After getting to know the trucks owner and chef I know for a fact that the food is quality. It's sad that people will bad mouth someones buisness without giving them the chance to fix an issue. Keep doing what yout doing Grilled Addiction, you're AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I don't often write a review. However, I was deeply dissapointed with the tri-tip sandwhich I bought from this truck today.  \"Grilled Tri-Tip Steak Sandwich\" - sounds mouth-watering, right?  \"A hearty helping of perfectly grilled meat...\" - Maybe two or three slices. Hardly 3 mouthfuls. Tough meat. I wouldn't call it hearty at all.   \"...placed on a soft, lightly toasted Brioche bun.\" - It wasn't a Brioche bun. It wasn't toasted. It was a standard, run-of-the-mill, small Walmart brand hamburger bun. it was sort of crushed, too. When the person outside handed it to me, they seemed surprised as well, and asked if this was the tri-tip sandwhich.  \"The bread is painted generously with a delectable aioli made from the finest Prepared Horseradish...\" - It was mayo. Plain and simple. Nothing special about it.  Overall, I walked across the street in 115 degree heat, and paid $12.00 for a small mouthful of tri-tip on a plain bun with mayo and bag of chips. Was it worth it? Not at all. I'm sorry to say, but I won't be purchasing anything from this truck again. Please don't come back."}
{"text":"They are very enthusiastic and high spirited. Take a lot of interest but very very expensive. I got a burger. It was little and no sides. They charged me around $10 for that little snack and I had to go but a meal somewhere else.   And I am not a huge personality at all. I'm just a 33 yr old female who weighs 130 lbs. I was totally shocked with the size of their sandwich. But the taste was really good."}
{"text":"We used Grilled Addiction to cater a rehearsal dinner for 50 people and everyone loved the food and experience. We offered guests a choice of Shrimp Po Boy, Pulled Pork, and the Tri trip steak sandwich.  Everyone couldn't stop raving about their meal. The green chile Mac and cheese is fantastic. I would definitely recommend using them for any event!"}
{"text":"Portion size is weak. For $12 you basically get a slider sized sandwich. Flavor was good, but just too small of a portion compared to the other food trucks we get on a weekly basis.   I give them a meh out of ten."}
{"text":"Overly expensive....  period.  Hamburger patties taste like they are frozen/store bought, barbecue sauce literally tastes like grape jelly...    For my onion topping, I got a measly three ring halves, and when you pay extra for the premium bacon topping, its less that one strip, ground into a little clump that's barely noticeable.  I had to check multiple times to make sure it was even there!  Top it off with unusually slow service and a not so friendly cashier.  Next time its around, Ill pay half and drive to Five Guys...  Now that I'm reading  more...  It appears my review mirrors most of the others on here so far.  I wished i yelped before i wasted my money."}
{"text":"Was at an event at Brix Wine in Carefree last night and they had the Grilled Addiction food truck set up in their parking lot.  Everyone was amazed at the great food that came out of that truck!  The fav was the lollipop lamb chops and risotto.  Great risotto out of a food truck!!  Really nice folks own and run the truck and are sending some great food out the doors.   After the event was over, I asked if I could see the inside of their truck and they were happy to show this beautiful truck off.  It is wall to wall stainless steel and beyond clean.  The cab of the truck is way cool, like riding in a big rig.  Can't wait to find them at the next event.  Would be a great way to cater a party at your house. Thanks guys and gal, Patty and Bubba"}
{"text":"We had the pulled pork sandwich at the Cubs game March 10th and it was absolutely delicious.  Some of the best pulled pork that we found in the valley.  We will be looking for this food truck as we travel about this fine area.  The pork was seasoned and not dry and the bun was toasted.  It will be a favorite."}
{"text":"This food is a little expensive for what you get. However, if indeed the food is organic, then it makes sense. The food appears to be of good quality. I ordered their special of the day, a hatch chili chicken sandwich. Presentation was decent, with tiny grill-marks over the brioche bun. Nice and tall. Flavorful, with just a bit of kick. Decently fast and cordial service. If i see this truck again, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great Food and Fun. We tried them when they were at Carefree Brix Wine Bar. Had never done a food truck before and the lamb with salad was really great. Looking forward to seeing them again in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Just hosted a surprise family reunion and booked Grilled Addiction  for the big event.  It was perfect!  Had 24 people flying in at different times.  Had Gluten Free and Dairy Free and Meat Lovers (me!).   Everyone was happy.  :)  The truck team made the evening as perfect as it could be!    Thanks Grilled Addiction for being a part of our special evening!!   Melody"}
{"text":"Not worth the money.  I got the tri-tip steak sandwich.  For a $12 sandwich,  it did not have much meat on it. The menu did not say that it contained horseradish.  Tried to salvage it and wipe off the sauce, but still had the overpowering flavor.  Don't believe it was something I overlooked,  as my friend also got it and hates horseradish.  Overall,  not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"This truck is the bomb!!! Menu is on point from the bacon mac and cheese to the tri tip steak sandwich-  This truck is a must try! The truck itself was immaculate...  I met the owners as well and they were so nice it felt like family! I'm definitely going to found out where their next stop is. Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious!!! My girlfriend had the lamb-chops and I had their burger. Both were seasoned and cooked perfectly! They are a prime example of those hidden gem food trucks you hear about. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot."}
{"text":"You know that if I'm willing to walk outside of my delightfully air-conditioned building in the middle of a scorching scorching summer day, it must be for a REALLY good reason.   I sadly forgot my lunch today, but my spirits rose pretty quickly when I remembered that a couple of food trucks were going to be pulling up to provide lunch options for our office complex.  We wandered over with high hopes of something good to eat.  So happy to say that we got what we came for!    I ordered a small (4oz) portion of the bacon mac and cheese.  Love that they bacon was layered throughout.  Great ratio!  It was creamy and rich - exactly what it should be.  My friends got the all-natural hot dog and the lamp lollipops.  I have never seen a hotdog look so dressed up!   Well worth the $7.95, plus it came with a side of chips.  She reported that the onions were the star of the show.  The friend who got the lamb enjoyed the meat, but didn't care for the sauce.   It takes a little bit of time to get your order, which I actually appreciate - it means they are making my food when I order it!  Thankful not to have heat-lamp warmed food.  Nice work, Grilled Addiction!"}
{"text":"I tried the Grilled Addiction food truck earlier today.  I was a little hesitant, based on mixed reviews I saw on Yelp and Facebook, but decided to give it a shot. I had the Tri-Tip Steak Sandwich, which was good overall.  The regular sandwich was decent sized, so there's no real reason to pay $ 3 and \"double the meat\", unless you are splitting the sandwich with someone.  A little pricey at $ 12, but tasty. My one knock on the truck, however, was the pre-visit literature circulated throughout our office complex that morning, which indicated that the sandwich was supposed to come with a \"side of the day\".  Not the case, when I asked about it.  I also saw someone else come for the 5 Cheese & Bacon Mac also advertised, which the attendant indicated \"hadn't been sold for months\" and that \"they must have given you old menus\". As this particular Food Truck hasn't visited this site before, it seems like these misses would be on the Food Truck itself.  Hopefully this gets addressed going forward."}
{"text":"Had their Kobe/Wagyu beef burger at the Salt River Fields food truck festival and it was outstanding.  I wish they were closer because I craved another one for nearly a week after."}
{"text":"My son and I had lunch at the Cubs game and was sadly disappointed. We both had the Pita Tri Tip and waited 26 minutes after we ordered for some stale bread and three small shavings of meat. When done eating, my son asked if I enjoyed my bread and onion sandwich."}
{"text":"This truck was outside of our office today and I had never seen it before. I really wanted to try the pulled pork but my coworker wanted the tri-tip (we were sharing because the portions from food trucks are normally HUGE). To our surprise, the sandwich was a very typical size. More bun and lettuce than meat, and the meat was very bland without much flavor.  Very disappointing for nearly $12  We also ordered the 5 cheese Mac, it looks amazing but is also very bland and flavorless. It had a unique flavor unlike any Mac & cheese I've tasted but it was saved by the bacon! The Mac was better than the sandwich but still - not worth $8  All in all, the gentleman taking orders (who I assume is the owner) was very nice and had excellent customer service. Their cooking time was a little long, especially for people waiting outside in Arizona! The food was lacking and the prices were ridiculous for the end product. My coworker and I are let down and still hungry."}
{"text":"Bomb! So good and fresh. Staff is so friendly and attentive! Must have the pork sandwich and my friend got the burger! Will be on lookout for Grilled Addiction!"}
{"text":"I wanted to make sure I put in a good review for you guys.  I would have posted a picture, but there wasn't anything left.  I split the Tri-Tip and the Kobe Burger with a friend.  Both were AMAZING!  The meat is well seasoned, tender, and cooked to perfection.  I also got the 5 cheese and bacon mac.  I refused to share that.  I wanted to climb in the truck and steal the whole batch.    Great food!  Great service!  Hope we get to see you guys again soon!"}
{"text":"By far the best lamb chop I've ever had. Seasoned and grilled just right. a slight aoili on top. It is just perfection. You have to keep in mind that they're just a truck and grill on site to order. If the line's long, be patient.  It is totally worth your time."}
{"text":"This food truck came to my office today for lunch. I got the tri-tip sandwich - it was okay, the meat was a little rare for my liking, I wish I would have known just how pink it was before I ordered, as I would have make a different selection. Also, we waited 50 MINUTES FOR EVERYONE IN OUR GROUP TO GET OUR FOOD! That is just absolutely ABSURD for a food truck! Plus, my sandwich was $11 no side or drink. While the sandwich, was decent..it was not worth a minute 50 min wait or $11."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this food-truck and get some good grilled food.  I literally paid for a pulled-pork sandwich that wasn't edible.  The meat had no texture, it was just mush except on the outside it was really crispy, so it seemed like it had been frozen and then just heated up.  It did not resemble pork in any way.  Besides the mush texture the meat was EXTREMELY salty, which leads me to believe they were trying to cover up some bad flavor or something, or that they had reheated the meat more than once.  I wanted to like this place, I'm all for someone following their dreams but the food just wasn't edible."}
{"text":"I'd like to review Grilled Addiction's food, but the wait was so long that I never got to eat it. Food trucks are supposed to be fast. Limit the menu, speed up the service. Also, the truck ran out of ice in its first hour of operation. Fail."}
{"text":"I probably should have guessed the value by the non-existent line in front of this truck today... but I didn't feel like driving anywhere, and it was the only one today, so I decided to try it, and I should have gotten in my car and went somewhere.  I ordered the \"Grilled Tri-Tip Steak Sandwhich\" with extra meat and a side of the \"5 Cheese 'N Bacon Mac 'N Cheese.\" The total: $20.24. Quite expensive for lunch, and even more disappointing once my name was called.   The sandwich looked as if someone forgot the extra meat. I saw more lettuce than meat. The Mac 'N Cheese was simple and small with bacon sprinkled on top. As I walked inside, I thought about how disappointed I was that I just spent $20 on this. So, I had my hopes up that maybe I would be surprised with the flavor -- I wasn't.   I would have rather picked up a tri-tip sandwich from Arby's for a fraction of the price. The meat was not very flavorful and lacked any distinction of being grilled, which one would expect with the name. The Mac 'N Cheese was mediocre at best and the only thing that saved it from being any worse was the bacon -- as we all know, bacon makes everything better.  So, small portions with fairly bland food is my overall opinion. I don't mind spending money for good food; unfortunately, I spent money on bad food and am disgusted about it."}
{"text":"This truck made an appearance at our office today. I was maybe one of the first ten folks to visit. I'm not sure that it matters, but I'm a firm believer in the whole story. (Also a colleague went after me and while her food looked good, her check-out was a bit of a problem.) I wanted to try the lamb but I was super hungry and grabbed the tri tip sandwich instead with a side of tots. For me, the tots were good, not great, and I'm not sure the serving size was worth the cost. Having said that, I absolutely inhaled the sandwich. The meat was gorgeous, the bread soft and warm, and the veggies nice and chilled for balance. It was completely delicious. I got the feeling the folks on the outside of the truck were relatively new to food service. The folks inside, however, were not new to food in my opinion. Hopefully these folks will visit often and I can try new stuff every time. I'm definitely not sorry I tried it."}
{"text":"A grouping of 3 or 4 come twice a month from 11am-130pm and they usually get really busy meaning long wait times. So today a coworker and I walked down at 11am to try and beat the rush. I decided to try the Grilled Addiction food truck, upon looking at the menu the tri tip sandwich sounded amazing from its description. Although its $11+ price with tax that included no side or drink (you can get tots for $3 more) was a little concerning but I figured that it would be worth it. I placed my order for the sandwich with no onions. Then I waited, and waited some more. After about 20 minutes I asked if my order was getting close and was told that the tri tip takes a little longer since it is being cooked. Ok, fair enough. After about minute 35 I finally received my sandwich. I immediately noticed that it contained onions and was very small for the $11 price tag. I went back up to my office (about a minute elevator ride) and say down to eat my sandwich. When I took the first bite I noticed that the 5 little pieces of tri tip that were in the mostly bread sandwich were ice cold. Even though I was told that the tri tip just came off the grill. Needless to say I will not be going back to the Grilled Addiction and I would recommend to avoid it as well unless you like a place that gets your order wrong as it serves you ice cold over priced sandwiches that you wait 30 minutes for."}
{"text":"I was happy to see this food truck at the Diamondbacks game. I'm from California, and I love the opportunity to get tri tip! There was no line at the truck and service was fast. The guy was super friendly.   The sandwich was smaller than we expected, but the meat...! They nailed it. The tri tip was succulent and amazing. Seriously good. The bread it was on was so-so--the bottom bun was immediately soaked through so it made it kinda awkward to eat.  But hey, the meat was the most important. We could have had a pile of that and dug in with forks and been quite content."}
{"text":"For weeks and weeks I was waiting to try the 5 cheese and bacon mac. It seems to sell out quickly, so I made sure to be there early at lunch time. I wasn't too hungry, so was debating on just getting the side for $4. But I was waiting so long to try this that I decided to splurge and get the $8 meal. When I was handed my \"lunch\", I was SURE they made a mistake and gave me the side instead of the meal. I felt seriously scammed. I just could not believe the small portion. I was hoping at least it would be the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted! Sadly, no. I found it quite bland and it was only salvaged by the smoky bacon added on top. So in summary: it was decent, but a complete rip off for the price."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the experience but the food was not up to par with the price. Requested a burger with bacon and it had none. Another individual in the office had the same issue. The patty reminded me of cafeteria style hamburgers. Too compressed and manufactured in texture. The lettuce was prepped way early as it had large amounts of red discoloration on the ends and this was at the very beginning of the lunch rush. I would not be able to recommend this to friends and family."}
