{"text":"Great food. Great customer service! The owner is a very friendly guy. Food is cheap and authentic! Highly recommend! The Rice Balls are AMAZEBALLS!"}
{"text":"Amazing. A fantastic chicken parm sandwich - well cooked, great sauce, soft bun. Great recommendations by the owner. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Forget how good and big the arancini's are. The fact is that the owner, Corrado makes everything homemade from scratch in the early wee hours. This shows commitment to quality and service. If you are lucky and eat when he is on site and not doing radio talk shows or working behind doors he will most likely come to say hello and show off his passion for running this place as if he were cooking at home for his family. Compliment his hair and food and you might get a nice parting gift from him :-)

Here again to get my Arancini fix but unfortunately no Corrado today :-("}
{"text":"Favourite place to eat in the downtown core. I work at a couple bars in the area so I'm always coming in or sending one of my co workers in to grab us good eats. Tried everything on the menu and haven't been dissappointed. If I had to recommend anything though it would be any of the sandwiches as they are huge or the gyro as its incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from California and stumbled onto this Gem in downtown Toronto. Had the pepperoni/sausage panzerotti which was amazing and Huge!! Great , personable service that made me feel like I was in the owners home. Give it a shot, you'll thank me later!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food! Tried their panzerotto, pizza and greek salad and it was all fantastic (especially the greek salad with chicken)."}
{"text":"Come here every time I'm in town. Their rice balls are the best! The tomato sauce is to die for! The food is consistent  every time."}
{"text":"Great service and super balls! We had pepperoni pizza, veal sandwich and rice balls. Everything was amazing, topped off with great personal touch."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff. Had the poutine which was delicious! Love that it's open late. Good for late night eats or a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"A solid place for lunch. The food is consistent (I'd recommend getting the chicken sandwich with cheese- it goes from a fine, regular sandwich to a fantastic one) and there's a lot of variety tho I've only tried the sandwiches, I admit. The prices are decent, it's fresh. I don't have anything really bad to say about it. It's a trust worthy option."}
{"text":"Best in town all around. Their veal sandwiches are authentic and yummy and huge, but you have got to try the panzerotti for sure! Get it with no sauce inside, and order a large meat sauce on the side to dip it in! Seriously! Or just tell Corrado (Charlie) you want it \"Heather's way\" - he'll know what you mean! The arancini (rice balls) are killer in flavour AND in size and they are also a MUST TRY! Just go, enjoy the food and Charlie's personality! Prices are spot on for the portion sizes and the amazing quality - a deal actually!!!"}
{"text":"My review is based on the famous rice balls (arancini) and dayum gina! They are so good! I'm not sure what they do but don't stop doing it- those balls are amazing. 
The heavenly smell wafting out of the container, my only dilemma is, do I eat this while I'm driving or no? 

The service here is exceptional as well, Dita, the lady at the counter is always smiling and remembers my name- which means a lot to a returning customer. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Perfect after-bar food. Corrado is almost always there and he's one of the nicest guys I have ever met. Super welcoming and he gives great recommendations. Great Italian sandwiches. The rice balls are a bit overrated but, for the price point, you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"Perfect cut of meat, sauce to bread ratio was on point and the peppers and mushrooms topped off what I believe to be one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while. If I lived here I'd be a regular. I don't write a ton of reviews but felt compelled after my lunch today. Corrado is a beauty. And this spot is money."}
{"text":"I dropped by here yesterday for the first time and have to say WOW it was amazing.

we ordered a few rice balls as well as a chicken parmigiana sandwich. It was all incredible!  I saw one of the pizzas while I was there and definitely plan on ordering one next time around. Portions are huge and prices are very reasonable. 

The customer service was amazing and friendly. I was told by the owner that they just opened a few weeks ago, the interior is very nice as well. (if anyone remembers this use to be Naz's falafel, which wasn't very good, so this place is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood!)   I will definitely be coming here again, especially since I live in the area.

If you're in the mood for some quick,  tasty  italian (and some greek!) food, which is very reasonably priced then this is the place to go!

I cannot wait to try out the rest of Corrado's menu!"}
{"text":"First visit today.  They moved recently from the North York location. 
The customer service is impeccable, Corrado is generous, personable and goes out of his way to make you feel welcome. 
Tried a slice of pepperoni pizza which was delicious, fresh tasting and I love fluffy crust!!
Main course was Chicago Gyros: flavorful savory beef&lamb wrapped up in a grilled pita with house-made tzatziki.  
Side of fresh cut Greek Fries: Beautifully seasoned and topped with Feta. Only feedback would be to ask for the fries well-done if you'd like it extra crispy. 
Every part of this meal was fantastic and worth repeat visits. 

Will make it a regular stop before/after a movie, even if it's just to have a rice ball (arancini)."}
{"text":"I went to go check what the hype is about this place is.  I ordered a few things such as arancini and a panzerotto.  Corrado (the owner) is amazing and the service is 10/10.  Really good arancini ball's. The thing is huge and tasty!  Panzerotto was OK. I'm pretty picky though.

Food 4/5
Service 6/5"}
{"text":"One a super rainy day, I found myself at Corrado's seeking shelter. I got one of their rice balls and I was so happy I did. It was hugeeee and came in this yummy marinara sauce. I honestly should've gotten two. It was the perfect thing for a cold, rainy day. 

Luckily it was still early afternoon and the place was fairly empty so I was able to take a booth and enjoy my rice ball. I will make sure to pass by and try their other foods next time!"}
{"text":"We ordered some takeout on a Saturday night.  We tried pizza and a meatball sub, and both were great.  We mistakenly ordered four Arancini for a family of five, but they are HUGE!  Very tasty, but we should have ordered two instead.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was awesome. The kind of place you don't look at twice when you walk by if you don't know what it is, but the reviews were right and we are so happy we made the trip. We each got a gyro with fries- nothing fancy just delicious food and a great price."}
{"text":"Fantastic hospitality here. Owner really welcomed me and talked about their food. Never had poutine so she put some in my to-go bag to try. Food was great! And looove poutine! Definite must try for downtown Toronto for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great sauce, fresh bread and fantastic owners make this place a true hidden gem. Highly recommended if you're in the city and looking for a top notch veal."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and I have enjoyed it every single time.  They have the best arancini balls filled with lots of meat, peas, and cheese.  The gyros are juicy and packed with flavour!  

Lastly, the service is amazing...the owner was super friendly and he gave us extra meat sauce for the arancini!  

You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"I would say this place is a pretty good greasy spoon type place with an italian twist. The food is good for what it is but my 5 star rating is mostly attributed to the customer service. It's truly a friendly, customer oriented place and worth a try."}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place is holy temple for delicious saucy dining, and the man behind it is God himself; a hero to this great city that is even greater now because of his presence, his veal, his za, and oh yes, his big beautiful balls."}
{"text":"The food is second only to Corrado's warm conversation. Great food, very generous portions, and an owner who makes you feel welcome. Can't recommend this place enough, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time at Corrado's.  Loved it.  The food was delicious. The portions were very generous. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and have had the most amazing experience.. From the food to the service.. Charlie himself takes great pride in what he does and there isn't anything greater to a business then seeing the owner, sleeves up and working \"balls to the wall\" to ensure that his brand, his product gets delivered with great passion and commitment. Love the guy and his food! Onwards!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place on a Saturday and I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality food and the friendly staff. Please be sure to try the arancini, with a side of chicken parm hmmm I will be back soon"}
{"text":"We are staying at a hotel on King Street. No chance that I'd hit a tourist trap restaurant in the area. 

I found this place on Yelp. OMG --- the food is over the top. Homemade goodness. Fresh everything. Huge portions. 

My wife and and I had the most amazing gyro. Sister in Law had the chicken Parmesan. Niece had the fries with Feta and their signature rice ball. Everyone raved about their meal. And we left with doggie bags. 

We will be back. #awesome

Just go!"}
{"text":"Corrado has a passion to please and this family run business does consistently make great quality Italian pizza and other Italian and Greek food. A+++ try it you will love it"}
{"text":"Everyone needs to visit Corrado's while in Toronto.  Not only is the Chicken Parmesan and Arancini delicious but the owner is super friendly with a great sense of humor!! They have great service and make you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"It's our first time here. The owner Corrado took the time to explain the menu and gave us complimentary salad. We are really impressed by the food, especially the veal sandwich and the hospitality. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Simple, basic food, fresh ingredients, home like, taste great, not expensive,  much better than one would think from a first look at this place. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible! I have no idea why it has this many stars Do not waste your time or money. Me and my boyfriend were starving after traveling to Toronto from New York so we looked on yelp for a close place to get a quick bite and saw this place so we figured we'd give it a try ... huge mistake ...I ordered Bruschetta and he gave me tomatoes with feta cheese on a roll :/ that is not what bruschetta is ! My boyfriend ordered the arancini and a meatball sandwich :( the meatball sandwich was a flat meat that didn't even resemble a meatball not at all what we were expecting he loves meatball sandwiches but this he couldn't stomach it looked like mystery meat!! The only thing that was decent was the arancini ... needless to say we paid and we left never to return"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I'm still craving that panzorotti I has here. So delicious. I also had a rice ball which is very good as well!"}
{"text":"God a veal sandwich there with cheese - very generous portion of cheese and the sandwich itself was quite large. Came to like $11 with a coke. 

Sandwich was good but not great, most veal sandwiches I've had come with hot peppers in them but this one didn't. Maybe they have peppers but I didn't think to ask because I'd assumed it would come with it, so maybe my fault. 

Sauce was rather plain, but there was a good amount of it. My one critique is the meat-to-bun ratio. The bun was very bulky and kind of masked the taste of the other ingredients. I found myself peeling off some of the bun about half way through. 

Overall would recommend, but not before San Francesco's or Californias."}
{"text":"I got a gyro, it says $9 on the menu, yet it was $11 on the receipt before tax. i didn't say anything about it. He said he'll give me a 'free' drink, and I chose a bottle of water. The water was not sealed. This was utterly shocking. not going there again."}
{"text":"Corrado was amazing!!  Just the nicest person ever! It was my first time here and he was so wonderful and recommend a few things off the menu considering I couldn't decide. I went with the steak sandwich with the works and he through in a free rice ball which was amazing!! Great service even better food! Totally worth the 5 stars"}
{"text":"I honestly just don't get it. I went here because I wanted to meet a friend relatively close to Union Station and wanted to eat something good. There are a lot of pricier joints downtown so I opted for Corrado's. It looked like it was going to be cheap + delicious arancini and italian-style sandwiches. I was rather disappointed when I actually ate it.

I love arancini. I love rice, and love rice with creaminess. And fried, crispy breading? Arancini is a delicious union of the two. Unfortunately Corrado's arancini doesn't quite measure up. Sure, they're pretty big, and the filling is actually creamy and tasty, but I don't see the point of smothering the arancini with tomato sauce as you can't taste any of the crunch or crispiness of the breading, and makes it just taste like I made rice with cream of mushroom sauce and pasta sauce. 

The sandwich wasn't anything spectacular either. I much prefer Porchetta, Club Sandwich, or even my own sandwiches. Maybe the other menu options are better. Who know's, I'd much rather spend my time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The rice ball is to die for.  The sandwiches look really good too, but really you have to get the rice ball.  So freakin good."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Ordered Bruschetta and Pizza. Ask for spicy version. The chef cooked up easily the most delicious Italian food I have ever had. On the side he gave me a bottle of spicy sauce that was made in-house using red peppers etc. Amazing flavor. Easily the best food.The portion sizes are huge as well."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for the chicken cutlet sandwich with sauce and cheese but was disappointed.

The bun tasted cheap and the sauce was bitter.

If California Sandwiches is a 10, Corrado's is a 6.5/7.

Too bad."}
{"text":"We split the veal, the eggplant and the arancini. ALL AWESOME. Don't be fooled by the casual atmosphere, the food here ROCKS!! The staff was friendly and pleasant, the place was clean and the food was served quickly, warm and DELICIOUS. If you are even thinking of another Toronto Italian Restaurant, you are making a mistake."}
{"text":"Tried the break sandwich with the works and fries. It was outstanding, love their tomato sauce, crispy not too salty fries and the great humour of the owner and staff. In addition the atmosphere is extremely present and many other customers I spoke to are regulars. Definitely a gem I plan to revisit."}
{"text":"My first impression was this place has been in business a long time.  And then a customer walked in and Corrado knew his usual order and confirmed it without the customer needing to say a word.   Was the food yum?  Yes it was.  Was it worthwhile trying?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"My family loves the giant rice balls!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was delicious! The arancini is a must try. I came here based on a friend's recommendation and I'm happy I tried it."}
{"text":"We were downtown and craving sandwiches and the rating and price point of this menu on Yelp made it an easy choice. The service was amazing. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door and given a quick run down of their best sellers (rice balls, Italian style sandwiches, souvlaki) when the owner found out we were first timers. I chose the eggplant and my husband chose the veal sandwich, and he offered for us to try a rice ball on the house, which was so nice!

So, the food:

Rice ball stuffed with mozzarella and peas and covered in the most luscious meat sauce - amazing 
Veal sandwich (with tomato sauce, mozzarella, onions, peppers and mushrooms) - didn't have a bite, was too busy enjoying my amazing eggplant sandwich, but my husband loved it
Eggplant sandwich (with same toppings as veal) - see above 

Would go again, would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I had just flown in from San Francisco. It was very late and somehow Corrado's was still open! (They were actually closing but Corrado himself still let me order). The food was awesome. I brought my buddy back the next day. We tried the famous meatballs. At the of the meal, my buddy was screaming \"Corrado has the best balls in town!!!!\" It was so funny, next thing we knew a bunch people were taking pictures with Corrado and my friend (I added the picture). 

This is a great place. Corrado and his staff are awesome and the food is amazing. Next time I'm in Toronto, I'm going back there!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is worthy of my first ever Yelp review! We came in tonight due to all the great Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. We had a rice ball, veal sandwhich and a gyro. Although I found it a little pricey (but that is because everything in TO is). We were greated by the owner who is super friendly and the food was amazing! I would definitely recommend this place and since I travel to Toronto a lot for work, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The best veal sandwich I've ever had!

Corrado has the best tasting veal sandwich in town. The veal was juicy and the breading was very crispy with the right proportions. I had the veal sandwich with the 'works' (sautéed onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, and cheese) which really complimented the flavor of the veal. The toppings were juicy as well and nicely prepared with well cut proportions. 

It's worth mentioning that the staff were very friendly and attentive. 

I have to note that this isn't the best looking restaurant for those who place an importance on aesthetics, but Corrado's more than makes up for it with their delicious food.

I also have to note that Corrado's does serve up big portion sizes at decent prices so come hungry and be assured that you will definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place with my wife after a night of drinking. We just wanted something to munch on before we go home and saw their sign about the rice balls. They tasted really good!!! The owners were the ones that served us and they were also very nice. They told us that they got an offer from the show Dragon's den for mass production of their rice balls, but backed out 5 months before their agreed time. The rice ball is definitely worth a try; too bad the deal didn't go through."}
{"text":"I am a loyal customer that has followed Corrado from his Danforth location to Cosburn and now will drive from Scarborough all the way to his new downtown location. 

From the first time I met Charlie and his Family they all treated my wife and I like we were part of their Family. After a few years, it does feel like Family now. 

The pizza is the best pizza in the GTA and worth to drive a distance for. The rice balls and they are big, are delicious. Also have tried the poutine and other menu items. Nothing has disappointed my wife and I yet. 

Corrado and his staff are friendly, gracious and welcome their customers with open arms. Just as important is the food is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable. You get a good amount of food with your orders so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre and food wasn't as amazing as fellow yelpers described. The rice ball is way overrated."}
{"text":"The place is pretty good! We were inspired to stop by after the positive reviews on yelp and also because we love the italian sandwiches in St Lawrence Market (they seem very similar). The arancini (fried rice ball) is very good, it's very crunchy, with ground meat, cheese, and peas inside. Definitely a must-try! The sandwiches were also quite good. The bread was very fresh and fluffy, better than the ones at St Lawrence market, and the meatballs in the meatball sandwich are very flavourful. The eggplants are fried after you order so they're hot and crispy when you get them. 
Sandwiches range from $7-$8, with additional cost for toppings. I think it's $1 each for cheese and eggplant, $0.40 for onions, and $0.80 for mushrooms/peppers. 
The place is small and homey, and the tables at the booths are cute with lots of random facts on them! 
Overall, great sandwich, although I'd say i prefer the St Lawrence Market ones just because the sandwiches here are not spicy and the ones at the market are super spicy!"}
{"text":"Skip the subway and their secret ingredient rubber bread, microwaved meats and crappy attitudes and drop by this spot for a damn heart stopping sandwich!  $7.25 for a veal sandwich and the deep fry that magnificent piece of pounded and floured veal in front of you.  They smother that puppy in sauce and you can add other items for extra.  I added cheese  ($1) because cheese and sauce is never a bad thing!  Did I mention the bread tastes like it was made today?

I have no regrets at the moment but my heart might have skipped a few beats.  Would do again.  This place must be glorious when drunk.

Sub $10 meal, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Just got the meatball sandwich for lunch, and this preggo lady approves!! Plenty of sauce, great mouthfeel, great flavour. I'll be back for the veal sandwich and arancini (possibly after work this evening ;)) Owner is super nice, and the pictures on the wall show his smile is genuine."}
{"text":"Kleines aber feines Lokal. Von außen eher unscheinbar und eher nicht einladend. Durch die tollen Bewertungen sind wir doch rein. Zum Glück! Es war künstlich! Wir hatten einen super leckeren Arancini mit Tomatensauce, der recht mächtig war. Gefüllt war er mit Hackfleisch, Käse und Erbsen und natürlich Reis. Desweiteren einen der besten Gyros die ich je gegessen habe und einen Panzerotti gefüllt mit Tomatensauce und Käse. Dieser war frittiert. Sehr zu empfehlen!!!"}
{"text":"The rice balls are so good! Get with tomato sauce (not meat sauce). The sandwiches are huge, the owner is a really nice man. Gave us free drinks with our order, came over and talked with us. Great late-night food, also good for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"About a year ago, two wary and broke college kids from the States spent the day in Downtown Toronto. The famed rice balls and savory poutine were enough to attract their hungry souls. At the time the Madam at Corrado's was more than hospitable to provide great service, hospitality, and an extra dish/meal to us. You deserve this amazing review Madam @ Corrado's"}
{"text":"If I had been eating my arancini at home, I would have licked the plate. The sauce was that good.  I just find the King and John area to be lacking in affordable food at good prices.  When a regular recommended this to me, I was certainly intrigued given the fact that the owner is running this spot and one of its specialties is rice balls, a snack food that I love.

I had one arancini with sauce. It was just sooo good. I will definitely go back again for this.  Ordered a caesar salad which is often a mistake because it usually appears as a lifeless pile of wilted lettuce that has been drowned by the dressing. This salad was spectacular. It even had real bacon and croutons.  

My friend's veal sandwich looked like really good. I definitely would have been able to make two meals out of that.

Prices make this a great go to spot if you are just looking for a fast bite before going to TIFF for a film or to a Mirvish show. Nothing fancy but exceptional food considering the storefront of this place is a bit deceiving. Looks like a fast food joint but this is a place where you know that the food was made with love. Let's support this man's business so that he can make a go of it in this area."}
{"text":"I had a veal sandwich and the lady serving was less than polite.. sandwich was sub par it all fell apart.. and didn't really taste that good.. wouldn't recommend.."}
{"text":"Eggplant sandwich excellent. Had a meatball, really good.  Everything made fresh, family recipes brought over from Italy by his Mom. The owner, Carrado (Charlie) is super friendly, just like visiting an Italian in his own home. Great experience, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wasn't quite what I was expecting when I got there,  but glad we stayed.   Awesome service,  amazing food,  and I left wishing it was close to home.   Hoping to get back there again some day."}
{"text":"Sadly this experience was not remotely what I was hoping it would be. 

My fiancé and I heavily researched restaurants for our trip to Toronto and from the start this was on the top of my list to get to. It's so well-reviewed and I love arancini so it was really a no brainer. I practically dragged my fiancé here during our trip and boy, I felt foolish!

The place is really, really tiny. It was a hot, rainy day outside so coming into this super cramped restaurant with NO A/C was off-putting from the get go. 

Next, the woman taking the orders apparently spoke very little English. She asked, questioned, and confirmed our pretty basic order at least 4-5 times. Yikes! 

We each ordered a sandwich, one arancini ball, and a pop. $45! Whopping price for lunch. 

When the food came it was all just so disappointing. All of it. The whole experience. The food was so saucy and tangy and acidic. Really sloppy and hard to eat. It's 100° in the room. Ugh. 

I'm not sure what the hype to this place is but I was let down for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing arancini! It's huge, practically a meal in itself. Crispy and delicious with the tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Charlie is the man! Rice balls are authentic and the sauce tastes like my grandmother's sauce!!!!!! Salads are delicious as well! Such a hidden gem right on John st."}
{"text":"I ordered the veal parm sandwich and their famous Arancini (Italian Rice Ball). The place had no a/c and I happen to go on the most humid day of the year making my eating experience just slightly worse.  Nothing much to say about the veal parm sandwich. It was average and I believe their oil had been overused as evident by the browner colour of the fried breading rather than a nice golden colour. On top of that, service was mediocre. I am giving her the benefit of the doubt that it was the most humid day of the year and thus making it an uncomfortable working environment.

The part that made up for all of this was the Arancini which brings my rating from 3 to 4 stars.  It was my first time trying this Italian staple, but it actually blew my mind. It is a simple dish consisting of a deep fried rice ball with cheese, ground beef, and peas in the centre and then smothered in Marinara sauce. The way these ingredients are combined together is wonderful and it brings out the best in each ingredient.

Don't mind coming back here for the rice ball or to try their pizza next time."}
{"text":"Had their arancini ball and all I can say is DO NOT BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS on that front.  They open late, so drunk kids after the clubs eat there and put up warped reviews based on them finding something they can stuff into their drunk faces that isn't McDonalds.  But if you're looking for a good arancini ball, you would not come here.  It's so middle of the road that I can't even say anything bad about  it.  Except that the veg seemed to be actually thawed frozen veg.  Can't swear it is, but it sure looked, felt and tasted like it came out of the freezer aisle at the grocery.  

Very middle of the road."}
{"text":"What a gem.  Great owner with great food.  My new \"regular spot\" in Toronto for a quick and tasty meal.  

Running late due to traffic, we had to find a meal with only 25 minutes to eat.   He is an awesome guy, funny and provides really good service."}
{"text":"Their saying goes \"oh we've got balls\". More like these guys got big kahunas. The taste and portion size is ridiculous. Corrado won an award at the CNE for his arancini so you know this ain't gonna be no tiny rice ball. The marinara sauce (made daily onsite) is so on point I would buy jars of it. I think the gyro pita is the best on this side of the Danforth but it's missing the fries. I'm sure if asked they would add it in since the service is impeccable. Not a fan of veal but ended up eating a quarter of the sandwich. I suggest getting it with the works (sautéed onions mushrooms and bell peppers) - don't forget the cheese.

Chat it up with Corrado and you will see what a stand up guy he is. His upbeat loving life personality got him onto the Food Network's - Carnival Eats. So nice that he even let me into the kitchen to spoon the pot of marinara (I'm happy to inform that the kitchen was very clean). Needless to say I had a 'ball' of a time and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Very delicious and fresh. Great for lunch break and the customer service is great as well."}
{"text":"This is the best sleeper restaurant that I've ever eaten ate at in my life.  The owner is amazing, the gyros, the rice balls, the service, the wait time, should I keep going?! My first time in Toronto, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing all the 5 star ratings, but I'd say that the veal sandwich is quite mediocre. The best thing about it imo is that its quite big... I was pretty stuffed after I finished. 

I ordered one with mushrooms and onions. While the base price is fairly cheap, it only gets you veal and sauce on bread. Each additional topping is at or close to a buck (except the onions which are a bit cheaper). So the price can climb pretty quickly. 

The sauce they add is okay. I wouldve preferred it to be more flavorful. I couldn't really taste the onions, so I'd recommend skipping those. The veal itself was fine. The bread was fairly average. Overall, the sandwich was actually a little boring."}
{"text":"The balls are the best!  This will become are place to go each amd every time we are in the Toronto area.  DO THE RICE BALLS!"}
{"text":"Ordered the veal sandwich. It was fairly filling, but it was far from delicious and did not seem fresh. The price is not that cheap if you include toppings since many of the toppings cost extra. Also keep in mind that it is pretty messy to eat."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Great food and excellent service. Whether you are looking for a quick bite before a show or late night munchies corrado has you covered!"}
{"text":"This is just simple and tasty comfort food. There is a clear passion in making tasty food that makes you happy. The veal sandwich is so good and features a great homemade tomato sauce. You eat it and just want to fall asleep content. The rice ball is delicious. Service is incredible. This is a great spot run by a great guy who cares about serving you good food."}
{"text":"Uh the balls!! 
The gyros are super delicious! I mean unbelievably delicious! It's one of the top must try spots in toronto! The meatball sandwich was huge and amazing!"}
{"text":"I was totally disappointed! Me and a friend did a search on Yelp and only decided to come here because of the high rating but I was surprised to see the opposite. Fries are burnt, I got chicken salad, it was not real chicken; a processed chicken. Will never come back!"}
{"text":"I'd vote more stars if they had more available.

Small, family owned place that was busy for a reason.  Great meatball sandwich, fries and more.

We Got Balls!"}
{"text":"Updated review: Corrado's deserves at least 4 stars. I had come once before and tried the arancini (rice ball). I gave the restaurant 2 stars at the time, cause I thought the rice ball didn't have much filling. Corrado saw my review, reached out to me, and invited me and a guest back for a meal on the house.

I learned a lot from my visit back to Corrado's. His restaurant used to be out on the east end, and he closed that one down and moved to this John St location about 5-6 months ago. Him and his wife drive around almost daily picking up ingredients and supplies: vegetables are bought daily and always fresh, meat on mon wed and fridays so that it doesn't sit in the fridge longer than a couple days, and chicken on tuesdays, etc.

Corrado's is a mom n pop shop. You can tell that Corrado's really cares about his customers - their health, safety, and enjoyment of food. While I was there this visit, I could see him going around to every table (not just us) asking his guests whether they were enjoying their food and if everything was ok.

In terms of food: Me and my friend had the rice ball with tomato sauce, eggplant parm, greek salad, veal sandwich (with mushroom, pepper, onion and hot peppers), and the panzerotto (deep fried, with feta cheese, homemade spicy sausage, and roasted red peppers).

The highlight for me was definitely the veal sandwich. The veal was perfect thickness with crispy breading, and it tasted amazing with the toppings and tomato sauce. Panzerotto was also great, and although deep fried, it didn't taste oily. The dough was a really good balance of chewy and fluffy. As for the arancini - I gotta admit that the first few bites were very tasty...but then I ran out of filling and there was so much rice left. But hey, as my friend rightly pointed out, it IS called a rice ball, so it's going to be mostly rice. And I believe Corrado when he says this is as authentic as I'm gonna get it. So I guess rice balls just aren't my thing.

Anyways, the best part? They're open til 4am on fri and sat nights!!! Such a great late night food option in the area - authentic and fresh, yet satisfies your cravings. More italian sandwiches please! Oh, and they have souvlaki too. Score."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is for this place. Had a chicken parm sandwich and it was two paper thin slices of chewy fried chicken with a sauce I could barely taste. Most of the reviews mention the owner and the service as positives which I can corroborate as the food was prepared quickly and everyone was friendly; however being a nice guy doesn't make the food taste any better."}
{"text":"Corrado is the owner and swerved us.  It was great.  I had chicken souvlaki with fries and the rice ball.   It was too much food, so the fries got left behind.  The rice ball was a fun appetizer.  With truly fried rice on the outside and cheese and meat on the inside.   The chicken souvlaki was great.  Tasted fresh from the pita to the veggies and meat."}
{"text":"Amazing service by the owner (I think it's the owner) food was amazing especially the veal sandwich; wanted to try the riceballs but we're all out ;("}
{"text":"I am updating this review because of the offer that the owner personally extended to me and my friends.  A few hours after writing my original review Corrado had messaged me and explained why they were closed while at the same time giving me his cell number asking me to call him so that they could \"set something up so my staff could take very good care of you and your whole party\".   I did not notice the message right away since we were off doing touristy things and so I get a follow up message reiterating the original offer.  Once again, a rare occurrence nowadays in the service industry.  Unfortunately, our plans did not allow for us to return but you can be assured that when next I am in Toronto, this will be the first place that I come to for a meal.
Note to Corrado:  Please accept my apology for the delay in updating this review.  I had meant to update it earlier but I had some other pressing issues that I needed to attend to and this did slip my mind.  I do want to thank you however for your generous offer and am hoping to do a 3rd update to this review.  One that has 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I arrived in Toronto last Tuesday evening and wanted some good, quick food.  Of course, I checked out Yelp and Corrado's showed up at the very top with their five star reviews and it was right around the corner from where I was staying - so convenient!  I was warmly welcomed by the owner and quickly ordered the gyro with fries and a side of gravy.  The portions were huge, the food was fresh and very tasty and the price was a complete value for what you got."}
{"text":"Fast, fun, simple and good. The arancini with the meat sauce is surprisingly delicious and goes well with the Greek salad. This seems like a good bet if one were seeking afterhours food to counter a potential hangover."}
{"text":"very good place for working lunch. ?Sandwich is good, veal and chicken are both good choices.Only 7.75, big enough for two people. Pepper tastes good,mushroom tastes good. Salad is just soso,but portion is very big"}
{"text":"Best Italian food ever. Even Better than those I had in Italy. The boss here is really generous. Everything freshly made. Unbeatable service.  Nice clean spacious restaurant. Will come back soon to try. More food and chat with Charlie."}
{"text":"Was really feeling something from Burrito Boyz but figured I'd keep walking. Did a Yelp search and saw the near perfect overall rating here, so I figured I'd stop in. This place is fantastic. Somehow, it was 95 degrees outside and we walked in to an even HOTTER restaurant. The place had to be like 110 at the counter as I was paying, I don't know how they survive back there. I ordered the gyros and fries and my girlfriend got the large Greek salad. Everything was unbelievable, and reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Amazing rice balls! Great service from Corrado himself!! Cant wait to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Corrado's is a neighborhood italian place, serving southern-italian-style sandwiches, pizza, and arancini. It does not deserve its high Yelp rating. I went in at lunch time during the week, and got an eggplant parm (for over $10 after tax and toppings). It was over-saturated with oil, and otherwise bland... thank goodness for the $1-extra peppers. 

The food, ambiance, and service were all tired, all with the feeling of a place in its last month of life. I realize that this last month may be at the end of many years as a fixture in the neighborhood, but... I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I went back to Corrado's for lunch today after receiving a lovely message from Corrado himself following my previous review, asking us  to come back and  give the restaurant another chance, on him.  Two of us had the chicken souvlaki pita and the other two had the veal parm.  We were greeted warmly and the food was brought to our table piping hot and fresh. The pita was soft and warm as were the buns.  We all agreed that the food was so much better than our last experience here and was more flavourful.  We were given free drinks and a huge order of fries and were asked whether we were enjoying our meals.  Corrado is a very smart man who has won us over with his wonderful customer service!  Thank you very much for going above and beyond our expectations.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a story about the healing power of Corrados. I showed up to my girlfriend's house earlier today and she was a whirling dervish of emotion. Should had a long and difficult day at work and wanted nothing more than Corrado's balls in her mouth... Rice balls of course.  

Not only did Karate not only did Corrado indulge, he also gave her a second ball for free! 

If you never been to corrados we both highly recommend it. It's like dinner and a show! Corrado is a thoughtful, humorous, and amazingly talented chef! 

The rice balls alone are worth the visit, and a veal sandwich ain't too shabby either!"}
{"text":"Amazing Place! Must try the rice balls, they were astronomically delicious! Owner is very friendly and is very helpful with explaining what each thing on the menu has!"}
{"text":"Just had a rice ball for lunch. Tomato sauce was the way to go. Amazing!  May have to stop in again before I leave town."}
{"text":"Charlie was such a gracious host. My friend and I visited from London Ontario and we were very delighted with Charlie's warm welcome to his restaurant and even offered us a free rice ball to try. His rice balls are to die for - a must try if you ever visit. He also invited is back to sample more of his amazing Italian and Greek cuisine. It really makes a difference when the owner genuinely cares about his customers. We will definitely be back to see Charlie and try more of his amazing food. It was excellent and I highly recommend to anyone if you're in the area to stop in for his famous rice balls and say hi to Charlie."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggplant sandwich with extra mushrooms and peppers. We also had arrancini, panzerotti and chicken souvlaki. All the food was delicious. We sprinkled a few chili flakes to give it a kick. Portions were large. We were pleasantly surprised to be able to eat in a quiet booth during a very busy weekend in Toronto. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We came here after a night out on Adelaide. The food here is great and the service is excellent. The owner gave us free pizza and let us try the corrado's salad he made for himself. The rice balls are amazing and the corrado's salad was even better. The pizza was good too. They seem to really take care of their customers. The people next to us got a free size upgrade on the pizza they ordered. Definitely a great late night food joint"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last Friday. Excellent quality food. I got the gyro and rice ball. 
Gyro was the best gyro I ever had, veggie toppings were fresh, tzatziki was superb, bread was perfect and the gyro meat was flawless. 

The rice ball, I had no idea what to expect but WOW. 

Owner is extremely passionate of his food and is a very genuine great guy. 

Will go here again 10/10."}
{"text":"It's great if you're drunk, hungry and it's late but california sandwiches makes better veal sandwiches for sure and i've had much better arancini elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here after a friend's suggestion. And it was a good suggestion! 
I ordered the panzerotti which took 25 minutes to make fresh but was cheaper than most other things on the menu. (Other friends ordered smaller foods but paid more, however they were ready much quicker).
The owner seemed nice and offered to prepare everything at the same time (when panzerotti would finish). 
The bathroom hallway seemed a but spooky, but not too bad."}
{"text":"They were really quiet during lunch hour on a weekday. Every topping on the veal sandwich was extra $ and the rice balls seem over hyped."}
{"text":"Checked out Corrado's for the first time tonight as its a new place in the neighbourhood. It simply exceeded expectations in all ways: We ordered the arancinis and they were delicious; the service is genuine and the owner, Corrado, works the 12-14 hour shifts himself as he wants to genuinely get to know his customers. We walked in when they actually should have been closed already and they still made our order and gave us a free drink and the left over pizza for the night. The pizza was also incredibly tasty. Overall, Corrado's offers great value as the food tastes great and the portion sizes are generous - a testament to the owner. A must try if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"I ordered: Rice ball with meat sauce and cheese + veal sandwich + pop = 20$ for 2 people

Recommendation: Comfort food that makes you full, not a place for foodie that's looking for something special

+(1/2) Price vs Portion: we were very full but 20$ is little pricey for what you get

-1 Taste: 
Rice ball 
- literally a bowl of rice + cheese layer + basic tomato sauce top
- bland, nothing special
- bigger than you expect, about the size of cup of milk (240 ml)

Veal sandwhich
- thin cut meats + cheese + mushrooms + tomato sauce
- buns and meats were not flavourful so most of the taste is tomato sauce
- double the size of a big mac

+1 Comfortable place to eat and you get served"}
{"text":"I work close by and my boss always told me about this place due to its high reviews on YELP. So one day we finally gave it a shot. We go their rice balls and also their veal sandwich. DAMN they were both soooo delicious! I was actually surprised at how flavourful and filling the rice ball was. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wandered into this place for a pre-ballgame dinner and found it completely empty.  At first I was a bit worried but Yelp reviews couldn't be that wrong, right?

The reviews weren't straight up wrong - but I wasn't overly impressed by Corrado's...

We ordered up a medium pie w/ sausage and one of their 'famous' rice balls.  The guy behind the counter was totally friendly and offered to cut our rice ball in half and bring it over to the table while our pizza cooked.  While Sicilian style rice balls (rice, cheese, beef and peas) aren't my favorite - this one wasn't so bad.  The sauce was sweet.  The rice ball is huge!  Definitely near softball or grapefruit size and can for sure be shared by 2+ people. 

Pizza came out a few minutes later pipin' hot.  First thing I noticed was the lack of sausage.  For $2 I was expecting a hearty sprinkling of meat... not so much here.  That being said - the pizza wasn't bad.  Doughy crust - not thin but not thick either - which was fine.  Their sauce is a touch sweet and pretty good... but there was too much mozz for my liking.  Maybe I'm the only one but I'd prefer a bit less cheese and a bit more meat on my pizza slice. 

Solid effort by Corrado's... and its a short walk from the Rogers Center, so that's good."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Great people. Had the Veal and Rice Ball. A MUST TRY. The food was everything I anticipated and more. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is in the area."}
{"text":"A must visit in Toronto. This place is amazing! 
I've only tried the veal sandwich and chicken souvlaki before, but I'm already in love. So far, the chicken souvlaki is my favourite- the fries they add into it bring it to the next level. The owner is also really nice and is good to chat to when it's not too busy and you're waiting for your food. It looks like a small place, but they have a surprising amount of seats in the room next to where you order your food."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing! The manager can tell that we are new to the place so just gave us arancini for free! It is really tasty and feel like home food! I also had gyro. The meat was so tender but perhaps a little bit saltier than my taste. My friends had souvlaki and veal burger, the portion is huge! Also the service is great! I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing veal parmigian sandwich, and the lady who took my order was very nice. I'm definitely coming back here the next time I'm downtown.

I forgot to update my review after trying their Arancini. They claim to have the best balls in Toronto, and compared to a couple other places I've been to over the years, they most certainly DO. They're massive and have a generous amount of beef, cheese and sauce in them. Corrado's also has a great tomato sauce, which definitely makes the arancini that much better."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros (not sure why but even the tomatoes taste awesome), great rice balls and even better service. Owner goes out of his way to make sure you enjoy the food no matter what time of night it is! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here when the place first opened and I was pretty disappointing with the food. I ate  gyro pita with greek salad. I love greek food and often eat at Messini, its my standard for greek food in Toronto. This place did not hold a candle. The food was not as flavorful and not as filling. 

Avoid going here, and take the trip up to danforth if you want good greek food."}
{"text":"Rice balls were great.  Pizza was average Greek style pizza.  Just okay.  Meatball sandwich had meatballs in strips that were not fully cooked.  Gyro meat was over overcooked.  Fries were decent but served with a ketchup bottle that looked like it had been refilled dozens of times.  Place is not well air-conditioned.  People running the place were nice."}
{"text":"I am visiting the city and wanted to grab something quick for dinner. I did a quick yelp search and saw that Corrado's had pretty good reviews. Maybe some of the other items on the menu were ok, but I had the gyro and it really wasnt very good. It was incredibly overseasoned and the tomatoes were overripe and pulpy. The place was also completely empty when I went at 8pm on Saturday night."}
{"text":"You like big balls? He makes big balls! Go eat big balls! 

This place is a hidden gem. The owner is so funny and nice. His food is amazing and his personality and extra care with his customers makes it even better. I don't live in Toronto but I do come up often for work and will always stop here at least 1-2 times during my stay. 

Pros:
Great food
Awesome food
Affordable
Great service
Big balls! 

Cons: 
I can't eat here when I am in Austin 
If I ate here every day I might get fluffy but I would be fluffy and very happy 

Seriously, the \"Balls\" are amazing, the sauce he uses for the balls is delicious. The Chicken Parm sandwich is huge (and delicious). The Greek salad is perfect. I ate waaaay too much but I couldn't stop. It is so good. 

Definitely high on my list for places I will be a regular to when in town."}
{"text":"It is nice that many customers get free soda or a free rice ball.
I got free hair in my food. 

You can notice that the cooks there do not wear hats."}
{"text":"Great Italian food and super nice owner. It was our first time there and he hooked us up with a free rice ball (just get one. Amaazing)"}
{"text":"Located in the Entertainment District.  It's a nice cozy place to get some Italian and Greek eats.  They got burgers, souvlaki, gyros, and of course meat ball based foods.  The store's front sign actually says: WE GOT BALLS! right underneath Corrado's. So be on the lookout for this double entendre.

As you enter in, it will definitely transport you back to the early 1990s by which I don't mean you will  actually travel back in time and hear Tetris noises and Kurt Cobain screaming, but rather because of the retro 1990s interior decor and menu style fonts displayed above the ordering counter which is not a bad thing at all.  The only thing reminding you that you haven't traveled back in time is the TV in the dining area with the news on.   

I have gone to this place a few times already and it has always been beyond satisfactory.  Their chicken souvlaki and crispy fries are great.  The owner/chef is kind and courteous.  Definitely a place to stop for lunch, dinner, or whenever time of the day you are hungover."}
{"text":"Great spot with fantastic food. Corrado is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet!  

If you're in the area and are looking for a great pizza, gyro or rice balls, check them out! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why it's always Greek food that I crave when I'm particularly hungry, but I do. I've been here three times when I've been starving and always ordered the chicken souvlaki. It's delicious; I find myself thinking about it at times when I'm hungry again. I think I've had the same person serve me each time I've been there and he's always been very nice."}
{"text":"employee told me
\"best-seller? arancini\"
it was all a lie

a deep fried rice sphere
plus ground beef and mozza cheese
don't forget the peas

drunk me eats bland ball
i needed more alcohol
to think it was good"}
{"text":"Corrado the owner is passionate about his food and you NOT being hungry when you leave. I had the veal sandwich which was both delicious and enormous and he threw in a free rice ball as I had never been there before. I'll certainly return if back in Toronto. Great people, food and atmosphere--thanks Corrado!"}
{"text":"AWESOME rice balls filled with meat and cheese, covered in sauce. How do they get the outside of these savory spheres so crispy? The world may never know..."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food, and friendly service. One of the orders was misheard over the phone, so they covered it free of charge"}
{"text":"i went here about 3 months ago for the first time! i orderd the veal sandwich same with my brother but my mom orderd the chicken sandwich!
I WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It is my tied for favorite restaurunt with mandrin!!!!! also service is awesome corrado even took a picture with!!!!great restaurunt!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally came here to try the arancini balls and they did not disappoint. It was hot, and filled with delicious rice and cheese and covered in sauce! Would definitely come back for this.

Also tried to meatball sandwich (which I ordered thinking it would be just a meatball) and it was not good. The meat no longer tasted like real meat (nor was it shaped or textured that way), and the sandwich was very bready. 

The seating area on the side is dated and reminiscent of a mall cafeteria (clean enough), not ideal for ambiance but perfect for a place to sit and eat quickly."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend on a Sunday morning around 11:30am. We were the first customers there. We wanted to try the sandwiches and rice ball after reading all the good reviews about this place on Yelp!
Definitely worth the trip... We live in Stouffville, so this place is not close to us but we will be back for sure!!

Service 5/5 - the owner was very friendly and helpful. He probably can tell that it was our first time there, so he told us that their signature items are Veal sandwich,   Chicken sandwich, Arancini (Rice ball). He came check on us a few times to ensure everything is ok. 

We ordered:
Veal sandwich with \"the works\" - 5/5
Eggplant Parmigiana sandwich with \"the works\" - 5/5
The sandwiches were so yummy - the bun is crispy on the outside and soft inside ..the tomato sauce, cheese, peppers, onions, veal, eggplant.. Amazing!! 
Arancini (Rice Ball) - 5/5 Crispy, not hard at all (I had rice ball at another restaurant and it was hard like stone). This is the best rice ball I have had...

Everything is hot and very fresh! Very important!! 

Portion is generous!!
Price is decent!!

I am thinking about the rice ball already!! Lol..."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place from my co-workers and thought I would give a shot. I had the Veal Parmigiana Sandwich - it did not disappoint. It was huge sandwich - comparable to California's style. There's no way I could eat anything else with it. A good bang for the buck...

FYI - My friend had the Greek salad with chicken and loved it as well.

I'll definitely be going back...."}
{"text":"Very old interior with poor quality sandwiches.  The service we received also was disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here after my sister's recommendations on their balls (arancini). The store looks like a takeout joint that has a seating area attached.
It looks quite run down, but the food is decent quality for its price.
I ordered the arancini ball with tomato sauce and a veal sandwich. The balls I am not huge on since the tomato sauce sogs up the crunch you get. It kinda becomes a bowl of greasy rice with tomato sauce. The portion isn't big, but it's very filling so it can easily be a meal.
The veal parm sandwich on the other hand was very nice. Veal was crisp, flavourful and not too tough. The sandwich is nicely balanced and I wouldn't mind eating again."}
{"text":"Walked around and around to find this place. Followed yelper reviews. Not disappointed at all. In fact it was better than I was expecting! The rice ball was on point! The marinara sauce tasted so fresh and homemade. My bf had the Veal Sandwich he already had his breakfast at 10am  but he finished the whole sandwich  at 1130, he said it was delish. On top of that the Lady owner is very friendly and sweet, she gave us two bottle waters for free cause she saw how hot we were. Thanks yelpers!"}
{"text":"I rarely give out a 5 star but Corrado's has won my heart.  I usually bring my lunch to work but this time I forgot my lunch.  I was recommended to Corrado's by fellow co workers and they said that their pizza is excellent and filling.  So I gave it a try. At first I wanted a simple slice. But the aroma was so memorizing that I decided to order the large  Italian pizza.  I figured what the hell. I could not believe it,  I ate a two slices and I was full.  I usually eat four or five slices of pizza in one sitting.  But all I needed was 2 and it filled me up.  The servings and toppings were plentiful! I brought some home to the family and let them enjoy.  My family was fighting over the slices I brought home,  they were that good. Will definitely come back for more of this pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Italian food. What mostly drew us in were the softball sized arancini. While delicious and flavorful, I would like to try one of these made with the risotto rice rather than the plain white rice. The mozzarella poutine was delicious and pizza was flavorful and had plentiful toppings. Definitely happy I tried this and it was soooo filling!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Love the veal!! Such a big portion and great value compared with the other veal sandwiches in Toronto. Staff are very friendly and really go the extra mile to make sure your satisfied."}
{"text":"Where to begin:

This place is amazing.  Come for Corrado and stay for the food.

Arancini ball = stuffed. This can fill up a normal person.
Chicken parm sandwich = amazing.

If I could give this place 6/5 I would.  Corrado just adds that home element that so many places miss."}
{"text":"What can I say, family owned and run!  Super friendly despite only getting a few hours of sleep.

The sandwiches were awesome; perfectly fried and the sauce actually tastes like an Italian grandmother slaved for hours making it.  We got the veal and chicken with cheese and onions.  

Oh!  They have balls (Arancini rice ball)! A must have with the tomato sauce.  Stuffed with cheese, beef and peas this was perfect!"}
{"text":"The veal is very good - top 2 in the city for sure! That alone gives this place a 4/5. But the Arancini, the fries, the toppings...this place is the real deal. I have not even mentioned how great the service is, I started coming here frequently for lunch a few months ago, but on my first day I know how much the owner cared about servicing his customers; A very important trait to have when being an entrepreneur, this place has it. When coming here for the first time - id get the Italian side. The Greek is good but the Italian side is better."}
{"text":"The owner and his family are such kind-hearted people. We had the veal sandwich with the works (mushroom, onions, green pepper), chicken sandwich with mushrooms, and a rice ball. The sandwiches were huge and full of flavour; very similar to California Sandwiches. The arancini are savoury. If around, I would definitely pay a visit. Also, they're open until 4am on certain days. Good when sober, should definitely be good when drunk."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! I came for a quick bite to eat during my layover and got a gyro- so so good!! The owner was so welcoming and kind. He helped me figure out how to get around the city for the rest of my trip. All the food was really well priced and it's in a great location near the sites of downtown Toronto. Only regret is that my layover isn't long enough on the way back home to go back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the Arancini and veal sandwich.

The Arancini: had it with the meat sauce. Filling and tasty. Worth trying, don't know that I'd order it again but no complaints about it.

Veal Sandwich: get it with the mushrooms, cheese and onions you'll be happy you did. The veal is cooked perfectly, the onions and mushrooms are great accompaniments, and this massive, messy sandwich is everything you could want out of a sandwich.  

Eggplant sandwich: see above. Great alternative if your vegetarian.

Service: friendly, quick, and helpful. 
Price: 7-8 dollars a sandwich. No combos with the sandwich - but frankly given the size of the sandwich I don't think your missing out. 


Bottom line: if your craving a veal sandwich you won't go wrong here. Would certainly come back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place. I spend a lot of time in Italy, and I particularly love Naples. Last time I was in Naples I had the most amazing arancini balls, and when I returned to Toronto, I was on a mission to find arancini balls similar to the ones I had in Naples. It took me many months before I found one that came close, and I found it at Corrado's. The arancini balls at Corrado's are beasts ($5.50 a pop - $6 with tomato sauce)! In a good way! the rice is perfectly cooked - not too soft and not too hard. There is cheese, peas and ground beef in the middle - just like the ones in Naples. I also tried their panzerotto and was not disappointed. Now, every time I am in the area, I pick up several arancini balls to go and enjoy them for dinner and breakfast. So good!"}
{"text":"Must try! Amazing Rice Balls that are very affordable, everything I have tried on the menu has been spectacular.

So this review is a little bit overdue. Walked into this hidden gem a couple weeks back with a bunch of friends not knowing what to expect (The We Got Balls sign reeled us in) and after we ordered the food was prepared and brought to us by the owner. Amazing guy who is very genuine and he shared knowledge of Italian food and his Dragons Den story (ask him).

Will highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veal sandwich and was extremely impressed by the perfectly prepared meat, which had a crispy exterior and a tender interior! The sandwich was huge! Besides the food, the owners of the place were very friendly and genuine. I will definitely be back to try out more items on the menu. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend moved from NY and have high expectations for food.  We live 2 blocks away and stumbled across this absolute hidden gem after a crazy night out.  Their Veal Parm w Provalone and sweet peppers is better than California Sandwiches' and their poutine is better than Smoke's.  Needless to say we are regulars, and it hit the spot as it pertains to our hangover."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick bite of some Italian or Greek food. We had the panzerotti which was amazing but since it's all fried be ready for some left overs or take it as a meal to share. LOVED the arancini balls in tomato sauce. Chicken souvlaki pita was also good. There are a few seats inside the restaurants but mostly a pick up place. Don't expect anything fancy inside but if you have a quick craving for some pizza or souvlaki you will be served!"}
{"text":"We were headed to see Deadpool one night and needed a quick bite to eat. Looked up, and there was Corrado's! 

Basically a no frills Italian joint, but took me a while to sort out the menu. Owner was super nice, giving us the run down of what the specials were etc etc. Apparently the rice balls  were popular, but sitting through a movie with a massive ball of carbs isn't ideal! 

Went for the veal sandwich instead with sweet peppers, and cheese. TBH, breading was a bit much, but I know it was a quality sandwich. Not my usual go-to, but I know others would definitely like it.

Probably not the best choice before sitting through a movie, but if you're hankering for a filling sandwich in the area, it definitely fills the void!"}
{"text":"Wow, I've worked near this place for almost 6 months and just 'found it'. Went in one afternoon and I guess the manager served me. He could tell I was new and suggested a sandwich and their famous rice ball. Wow, both were off the charts amazing. 
The chicken sandwich was very well made with everything perfectly proportioned and working well together. Keep it in the wrap when you eat it or there will be messy consequences. 
The rice ball or 'Arancini' is amazing. It is basically some cheese, veggies and beef inside a big ball of rice with sauce inside and out. It is great. Just try it."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Parm sandwich and the Arancini ball was amazing. The owner threw in a free drink for good measure. Never had such a good experience at an affordable food location. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Never with their overdressed salads. Soggy and basically spoonfuls of dressing in my mouth. No. Their panzerattos are ok.... Lacks flavour. Really isn't amazing. However... I will try their famous sandwiches. Maybe that's what I have to order to understand this 4.5 star rating."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot after the bar on the weekends. It's open late and has the best veal sandwich in Toronto. Try the veal sandwich with onions, mushrooms and green peppers (aka \"The Works\")."}
{"text":"BEST GYRO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. But...the guy behind the counter was a straight up asshole and ruined my day. He was so rude I basically ran out of there as soon as he finished making my gyro..

It sucks because the food is actually really good, but it's not worth it with the terrible service"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Like other reviewers have said,  the owner threw in a free soda for us. I was already about to choose a drink when he said not to worry about it and grab anything I want. Super friendly and easy to talk to. The food was also delicious. Had to order the rice balls. Definitely worth trying. Rice and cheese inside a deep fried ball.  What's not to love! Also loved the veal sandwich and the pork souvlaki (make sure you have the French fries inside) . In the end,  I think we ordered too much. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Family take out restaurant with seat.  Out for a gyros, this place got Chicago style gyros, so we here.  Small old home retrofitted into a restaurant.  2 people working at lunch time, so order and prep is slow.  Don't expect real take service.
Order a gyros, it is ok Nothing wow.   Saw someone order veal sandwich, looks good, so I ordered 1 for myself.  Had better, buy Ok for the price.
Portion good for ladies, but for an average sized North American man.... Get another order"}
{"text":"So, just to make sure no one else misinterprets what kind of place this is like I did, this is more of a fast-food joint with pizza and rice balls, not a nice, sit-down Italian restaurant. My own fault for assuming that when I saw \"Italian\", but I haven't been to a lot of Italian places of this style. Usually Italian is fairly veg-friendly (another assumption on my part) but the only veg thing they have is pizza. Decent pizza, nothing too exciting. My cousin liked her veal sandwich. Not a bad spot at all, great value, friendly service, just not my kind of food. Maybe some veggie rice balls and some pasta as options, and I'd be happy!"}
{"text":"Corrado's was fabulous! Food was fantastic. We tried everything that was recommended by fellow yelpers - the rice ball (SO SO GOOD), the veal Parmesan sandwich, chicken slouvlaki, and panzarotto. Everything was delicious, very well priced and the service was exceptional. Carrado was super friendly and shared his story with us. He even gave us a free rice ball. Overall awesome experience and worth the time and money!!"}
{"text":"great placw for a take out or a quick eat. I had a veal sandiwich and it was really good"}
{"text":"I tried the veal sandwich with with mushrooms, green peppers and onions and it was pretty filling but tasty nonetheless. Although I felt that the breading on the veal was a bit too thick, the sandwich was pretty good with the toppings and the tomato sauce.

The owners were very friendly and the sandwich came pretty quickly. I would come back to try their famous arancini and their souvlaki."}
{"text":"Friendly and nice staff. Packed stuff up for us when we couldn't finish it. Large portions and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Corrado's is amazing! Awesome food, huge portions.  My husband got the souvlaki salad and he wanted to lick the plate when he was finished. If we were home he would have.  I got the chicken parm sandwich and it was phenomenal. The rice ball is out of this world!!! And his sauce is to die for.  We will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"I had a bit of time to kill before a movie, so I figured I'd stop into Corrado's for a quick bite.

Though they're known for their enormous arancini balls, I noticed they had something called Chicago Gyros on the menu, so obviously I had to sample that.

I probably should've asked what makes it a Chicago Gyro rather than just a Gyro, but at any rate, this was an above average gyro pita. The meat was tender and juicy, the accompanying condiments were perfect (and the tzatziki was delicious), and the bread was warm and fresh.

All in all, a good, affordable little meal, and I shall certainly be returning to try out their balls."}
{"text":"Our favorite stop downtown! Great food and prepared fresh everyday! Best Rice balls ever! We come all the way from Milton for the Rice balls, Souvlaki and Napoletana pizza!!! Love this place! Thanks Corrado for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the \"real deal\": tasty food made with fresh ingredients, generous portions, reasonable prices, and a proprietor who genuinely cares about his customers' dining experience and understands the concept of customer service.  This is essentially a high-end \"fast food\" restaurant, with a clean and comfortable eating area. My friend and I had been lamenting the lack of reasonably-priced, good restaurants in the entertainment district.  After a movie at the Scotiabank Theatre, we often want to grab a bite, but are usually at a loss to find somewhere that appeals close-by, and generally leave the area.  We were planning to see an afternoon movie followed by an early evening movie, though, and didn't have a large window in between, so I consulted Yelp and came across the reviews for this restaurant just around the corner from the theatre.  We had passed this restaurant several times over the past six months or so, but hadn't really taken notice of it.

As others have noted, the owner, Corrado (\"Charlie\"),  is especially welcoming to first-time visitors. He offered us a complimentary rice ball, one of the restaurant's specialties.  I thanked him but, having read the earlier reviews, I knew they contained meat and told him that, because I was a vegetarian, only my friend would be able to accept his kind offer.  \"No problem,\" he said.  He was just about to make a fresh batch, and he would make me a completely vegetarian rice ball, with mushrooms, peppers and other vegetables in the centre instead of meat. He assured me that he could make the rice ball without chicken stock or any other meat products and told me that the tomato sauce that topped the rice ball was meatless.  The rice ball was delicious, and could be a small meal in itself.  My friend's background is Chinese, and he prides himself on his rice-cooking skills; whatever the type of restaurant, he rarely enjoys the rice dishes, because he finds that they are generally not cooked to his satisfaction.  He pronounced the rice ball \"really good\"--high praise from him!  For our main dishes, he had the veal parmesan sandwich, and I had the eggplant parmesan sandwich.  Both were generous-sized and delicious.  My friend had asked if he could have some of the cold toppings on his sandwich, in addition to the regular hot vegetable toppings that are available. Charlie said that they're not usually added to the sandwiches, but not a problem--he asked whether perhaps my friend would prefer them on the side. \"Sure,\" he said.  In the end, when Charlie brought our sandwiches to the table, those cold toppings had morphed into a complimentary Greek salad, large enough for both of us to share. When he asked us what we'd like to drink, we said tap water would be fine.  He brought us two ice-cold bottled waters, also on the house.  Corrado's generosity to first-time visitors is, of course, an added plus, and very welcome, as is his genuine friendliness, and the generous-sized portions,  But let me emphasize that the bottom line here is that everything we ate was fresh and delicious.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and Corrado's gracious hospitality, and this will certainly be our \"go-to\" spot when we're in the neighbourhood. I'm looking forward to a return visit as a \"repeat customer\"; in fact, my experience at Corrado's was so stellar that it has moved me to write my very first Yelp review."}
{"text":"Every Torontonian that I mentioned this place to had never heard of it. You're missing out. Corrado's should be a staple of the city. 

The owner is charismatic and makes you feel like you're eating at his home. He defines comfort food and is actually funny. 

So I had the 

Veal Sandwich: Breaded veal with tomato sauce and green peppers. This sandwich will motivate you to learn the whole dictionary just so you can find the words with the right power to describe how good it was. The veal had zero surrounding fat, the bread was fresh, the bites would of came easy for a teenager that just got braces. 

The Famous Rice Ball: The best. The beef, the cheese, the peas..you know it's a culinary art when the ingredients rhyme. 

Whoever you may be, you have to go to Corrado's. Who knows, maybe one day Drake will instagram it and get it the attention that it deserves."}
{"text":"Amazing! Food was amazing, the owner was super cool and down to earth! Would highly recommend to anyone who's in from \"out of town\" like we were!"}
