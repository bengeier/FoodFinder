{"text":"Good stuff!  Always packed but it's worth the wait..good quality and the price is reasonable since it's in a resort"}
{"text":"Service was good and fast, but the food was below standard. Other pizza and pasta chain in a food court would be choice."}
{"text":"Big disappointment for breakfast
Staying at the MGM so went to the food court for a quick breakfast. Didn't think much of the omelet at Pan Asian the day before so I tried Bonanno's. If you try to order something different than the menu you will definitely throw off the millennials working there. I just wanted scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon. They seem to find it hard to believe I did not want potatoes or toast. So they charged me as all sides which again through off the millennial cashier. Required the server to explain. Sausage was tasty, tender, but cold. Bacon good flavor but cold. Eggs had like a dry side on them, as they probably were not stirring them enough. They had no hot sauce to cover it up so I pretty much just ate the sausage and bacon."}
{"text":"Wow...these reviews???.. if u dont have enough money to pay for a $6 very good slice of pizza why are u at the luxor? Go to the very end of the strip and visit the Mc Donald's dollar menu.  This place isnt too cheap but everything is amazing and very well worth it. Service is good, food court is always clean.  And the bottom line is if ur staying at the luxor and u want great pizza u wont be dissapointed here."}
{"text":"The sog starts here!  the salad was completely wilted, + the manager said, \"I know,\" and replaced with a very slightly less wilted one. Chicken Parmesan was 30% CRUST. 2 stars."}
{"text":"They didn't reheat our pizza enough and it made my girlfriend sick.  Definitely not a place I would return."}
{"text":"Not the world's greatest food, but my friend wasn't feeling well so we took a quick break. I grabbed some meatballs and promptly dropped them on the floor, myself, and another customer. Clearly my fault, but the staff were cool enough to replace them for free. 

Customer service may not feed me, but it's still important, and they took care of my hunger pangs."}
{"text":"This is good pizza...something Vegas highly lacks in. I'll be back.

It didn't look like it would taste as good as it did. Their pizza dough is spot on.
."}
{"text":"Idk what everyone is talking about.  This pizza is really high quality and made very well. 
Is the price good? Not really.  But, if you want a high end quality pizza then this is a good place for that.
Remember,  if you leave a bad review you might end up sleeping with the fishes or possibly waking up with a horse head in your bed.
Is the pizza here good? ??
Forgettah bout it...."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday and it was awesome!  Friendly staff. Spotless . Great variety.  Had pizza and baked ziti.  The pizza was like good pizza from New York.   I had to look behind the counter to see if my mom made the ziti...tasted just like home.
If you are near the Luxor make e a point to eat here."}
{"text":"Been here few times but last night I ordered whole pizza to go. When I get home we have to throw away over half of it. I ordered well done half sausage and pepperoni but the pizza guy rush it and not cook all the way. Remember I ordered well done. Paid a lot for it and wasted my money. Just really tick me off because I was expecting a good pizza."}
{"text":"Alright pizza, terribly dry and sub par garlic knots, terrible customer service, and a little pricey. I don't recommend this place to anybody. 2 stars for a good location. It'll feed your hunger, but will not even close to please you. If I had 3 hands I'd give this place 3 thumbs down."}
{"text":"Right from when you come in, you can tell this employees  love their job. Offer great customer service very attentive. Good was so delicious, the garlic knots I personally would give them a 10. Pizza, you can choose from a slice to a whole pizza. A must stop if your shopping at downtown summerlin"}
{"text":"Try the Stromboli!  It is the best thing n the strip hands down. NYNY has nothing on these guys. Dani operated the register accurately."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Summerlin because we had never been there, and she wanted to shop.  We started to get hungry, and being from New York, and she is Italian, looked for a pizza place. When we saw Bonanno's we thought we would give it a try.  Well, she ordered a couple of plain slices, and I got the ham stromboli, and let me tell you, this was the best Italian meal we have had, outside our house.  Not for nothing, but you know when the grease is dripping on the plate that it's fresh, and the gravy (sauce) has chunks of sliced garlic, it's just the right amount.  We ate outside, and when done, I went in to tell them it was damn good, and the chef was there, a nice guy!  I'd go back to Summerlin just for this joint, forget the shopping."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality and size, but it's just so convenient to be able to grab something to eat in the food court. If any of the other places had vegetarian options, I would go there, but pizza it is. The garlic knots look good, but I think they have a funky flavor to them. I've had the greek salad twice and both times the lettuce was pretty wilted. If I'm staying at the MGM I don't necessarily want to eat here, but it's convenient and cheap compared to everywhere else, though it's still overpriced for plain cheese pizza."}
{"text":"I don't understand these other reviews, this place is great. The only things I have eaten here are the pizza and garlic knots. This place is a tradition every time we are in Vegas. 

Let's remember, it's in food court so the bar isn't set too high. 

The pizza is outstanding and I consider myself a pizza aficionado. The crust is very thing with a perfect chew , great sauce and perfect cheese to topping ratio. This trip I had a slice of cheese, pep, sausage and pep, spinach and mushroom. All were perfect. Made a mistake going to planet pizza on the other side of the hotel and it was nasty."}
{"text":"Just about every night after a night on the town while we were on vacation, we had to grab a slice (or 4 for me). I'm a big fan of pizza and this place was really good. They had a variety of choices from cheese, to veggie, to meat topped slices. Also, could order whole pizzas for large parties. Their menu also included strombolis, stuffed pizzas, pastas, salads, chicken parm and desserts. All on display and looked very appetizing.

I always had to have my chicken and jalape√±o pizza with every order as well as a meat topped one. There was bbq chicken as well. Very good!

Open until 5am, this was a popular spot and we were lucky to have it in our hotel at the MGM. I would highly recommend going if you wanted some late night pizza and are around the MGM or staying there."}
{"text":"The little ceasers that was at this location was so much better.  Pizza slice i ordered was cold/reheated and not very tasty.

Best new york pizza is secret pizza at the cosmopolitan"}
{"text":"Chesse pizza was very good! The crust was crunchy and soft. The staff was friendly and I love the interior decorations. They also have patio seating too. Great place to hang out at!"}
{"text":"The pizza I got was not fresh.  Felt as if it was from day before.  Cheese was sparse and lacked and real cheese flavors.  Pizza is better from a frozen food that I get at local supermarket!  Disappointed."}
{"text":"In the Mezzanine food court at Luxor. Stopped there twice this past week when I wanted a quick lunch. Had a slice of mushroom and a slice of supreme, side caesar. It's thin New York style pizza. Nice size slices. If you like it slightly more crusty, ask them to leave it in a bit longer. Mine was perfect and hot and the customer service was excellent. Nice kids working the counter. Eager to please and courteous."}
{"text":"Downtown Summerlin is the perfect place to grab a slice before doing some shopping. Bonanno's is good NY-style pizza. Slices are a little pricey. I had a slice of cheese, a slice of veggie and a bottle of water for $14.

It's a cool spot to eat and people watch. They use good ingredients and the crust is crispy enough to hold the pizza without it flopping over. The slices are a good size. You can fold them or tear it in half. 

Bonanno's is good pizza in a fun location, but they are stuck on Strip prices. Bring the price down a bit and this place is a 9/10."}
{"text":"Strolling through DTS looking for a joint I hadn't hit yet, and made the wrong choice picking Bonanno's.  It's just okay... nothing special. I feel a little ashamed for them that they bill themselves as an authentic Italian pizza. It's really not.

Flavors feel very \"corporate,\" if that makes sense. A real \"Sysco\" flavor to the sauce; on the tomato paste-y side, and greasy mozzarella that most 9-year olds won't complain about, but for adults, we should want more.  The crust has no real life or mouth feel to it; not a nice crispy-chewy feel like you'd want, but more of a baked, airy, crumble texture; and there's some oily/buttery-ness going on that shouldn't be happening.  The pizza oven is new, so not really seasoned or broken in, so no added flavor coming from that.  There's actually a cook timer on it too, which is disheartening. (Really?.. You can't cook a slice or a pie by look and feel?.. authentic)

Oh yeah, the price... $9.08 for a cheese slice and a tomato basil slice. For what the product is, it's overpriced. When I went back in for a water, (Aquafina) it was $3.18. Pass.

I guess it's okay in a pinch, and with not many, or any, other pizza joints in here, this will have to do. Again, it's not special, which for me, means it shouldn't be around. If you're going to spend the money opening a place in Downtown Summerlin, and bill yourselves \"as if,\" then be that. Do it right... Not whatever this is."}
{"text":"I was here back in October 2014 with my family and we were very disappointed with everything. From the customer service to the food. The one thing that happened was one of the garlic bread fell off cause we had so much and thought they would've gave us another one but they didn't. They noticed it too. The thing about the food was that it was because very dry, and hardly any taste.  I would NEVER come back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"It's food court pizza, about what you would expect. We went to the food court since all the other restaurants were closed after 11 pm when we got in. The pizza was fresh and they had a good selection of slices available. Service was alright but the cashier didn't ask if I wanted a drink."}
{"text":"It cost me almost $6 for a slice of mediocre pizza. The slice wasn't even THAT big. This is only something that's even remotely viable after a long night of drinking. I mean who isn't hungry and willing to eat anything at any cost?  It did the trick, but I wouldn't even give this place a second thought soberly. I'm a little embarrassed for New York that they call themselves \"New York\" pizza."}
{"text":"Open late, so I guess this place is good for late snack munchies...... but you're in Las Vegas, so there are way more options available!

Pizza is alright. The value is definitely not here because while it was a decent pizza, it cost me almost $20 for two slices of pizza. You can bet that there were hardly any toppings on these pizzas either.

They also serve pasta and zitis, but I honestly haven't had the chance to try em."}
{"text":"This place has an advertisement outside that says \"Two slices of cheese and a drink for $7.95.\" When you add a topping to it they charge $1.70 per slice. That's what one would normally charge for a topping on a large pizza. They charge it for five pepperoni slices.

The pizza wasn't great either. It was super greasy, which some people probably like, but I don't. The crust was excellent and it was cooked nicely but there wasn't enough cheese. Too much of the slices had red where there was no cheese at all. 

It was also annoying that there is no place to wash your hands, something needed after handling the greasy product, much less before eating. There are no bathrooms in the restaurant that I saw."}
{"text":"Sorry I ate here.  

The staff needs food handling training."}
{"text":"Not much to say. Had a whole supreme and also a slice of cheese. Both were greasy. The sausage were thickly sliced and was bland. Crust was thin which made it soggy. Overall flavor was so-so. No bathrooms in establishment for patrons that I could see. Small joint so it did have the feel of a neighborhood pizza place in NY. Not my kind of pizza that I like though."}
{"text":"I was drunk and it still didn't taste good. 

The crust of the pizza was hard...kind of like cardboard.  The crust also had zero flavor.  I have no idea how in the world that could happen, but it did.

The pizza didn't have very much cheese on it either. They looked so good sitting behind that window.  Unfortunately, in this case, looks are 100% deceiving.  No ooey gooey cheese.  Toppings were very sub par.

Even though the pizza sucked, the customer service was great!  The girls working were very personable.

The brownies were good as well."}
{"text":"The absolute worst pizza in Las Vegas.  We paid over $30 for 4 slices of BURNT BLAND \"pizza.\"  The staff was careless and cussing at each other and clearly didn't care one bit about the quality of their product.  Seriously, the bottom of our slices was jet black and tasted like charcoal.  This was the worst part of our vacation.  Made a Yelp account just to review this horrible establishment."}
{"text":"New York style pizza. They sell the whole pie or by the slice. 

The crust is soft but yet had just the right amount of crunch. The pepperoni could've had a little more crisp to it and didn't have much flavor.  The cheese was melted just right and was pretty good. I'd add just slightly more red sauce to each slice. 

Overall, it's a decent slice of pizza to pick up along the way of your shopping at the mall."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! These guys are the bomb.com! I'm from out of state and now i think we have a good reason to come back!"}
{"text":"I love Bonanno's. It's my favorite pizza in Vegas! I saved up a ton of buy one get one half off because I eat it the entire time I'm there. Sometimes twice a day! Pepperoni and pep and sausage are both killer!"}
{"text":"Place is rip off lol. Pizza tastes bad. Really expensive and not worth it. Buying this pizza gave me this \"kick em while your down\" kind of feeling. Maybe it's cuz I lost a lot of money at mgm but still, screw this place."}
{"text":"Wandered in here while browsing around at the shopping mall. I had a slice of mushroom pizza and my mom had a slice of bbq chicken pizza. They weren't too greasy. We both liked our pizza but we also both agreed that it's not worth $5 a slice. The garlic knots were ok. Friendly staff and clean restaurant, but lots of screaming kids on a Saturday. Lol"}
{"text":"Not bad- for a food court pizza.  I could barely taste the pepperoni on this pie, but the overall flavor was decent.  The price was rather excessive- $5.95/slice. I guess Bonanno's wants to provide a real Big Apple experience: NY-style pizza and a mugging at the cash register.  Still, it beats the hell out of starving."}
{"text":"Bonano's Bew York Pizza is my absolute favorite. I come here everytime I come to Vegas. There is no better pizza. I don't care how fancy or not, what region- Italian or frozen. There is nothing that sings to my taste buds as beautifully. Lol!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza ever. I want Bonannos over all. Lol. Just couple pepperoni slices and I'm good to go. This is the first thing I go for when I get to Vegas. The baked ziti is great too. Just get all of it."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is only 3.5 stars but I really liked the pizza here. They warm up the pizza and rolls once you order in a brick oven which took about 3 minutes. It was about $12 for a slice of all meat pizza, a garlic roll with a medium soda so it's reasonable. The flavor was good I would come back here for a quick snack. There is lots of seating in the food court as well."}
{"text":"New Yorkers who live in Vegas are forever in search of that \"pie from home !!\" Bonanno's is my new favorite place. My daughter and I stopped in for a slice on Mother's Day and I was pleasantly surprised !!! We ordered a cheese pie and a supreme to watch the Knights play last Friday night and it was as delicious as it was on Mother's Day. Only downside is they don't deliver to Lone Mt and 215. Not even on Uber Eats. They need to step up the delivery options !!!"}
{"text":"Being a sales rep, I am in vegas at the Mandalay Bay convention center more than I would like. The food court is close and easily accessible. The lines get long but the servers are fast and efficient so you don't really have to wait long. 
Bonanno's is a go to for me. I tried the rest of the places, but the pizza in the food court is the best. It's a pretty authentic NY slice and the Stromboli is great too. 
One slice and a side salad is $10 but enough food for lunch. Two slices would be too much. 
Trade show people- give this place a shot. It's better than the other options!
Hotel guests- there are better options away from the convention center in the hotel."}
{"text":"0, if possible. The employees make less in 1 hour (7.25) than the store does (7.80) for ONE SLICE.  Nah, not how life is supposed to work. Screw that."}
{"text":"Late light munchie time! Craving pizza and picked up a cheese slice, side Caesar and some garlic knots. The pizza crust is light, crunchy and has great flavor; not bready or heavy. The salad was good, but the garlic knots rocked snack time. They are BIG, not the little bites like other places. Lots of  fresh garlic, soft on the inside and a little crisp on the top. I was so happy with this late night carb fest.

{"text":"I shouldn't even give one star because I just paid $10.00 for a 4 inch piece of Stromboli and the whole thing was raw in the middle. I should have taken the hint when the lady working there tried to give me an end and I asked for a middle piece. I paid for two bites and had to pull the nasty raw middle out. Buyers beware there are a ton of other places to eat that will be more conscientious than Bonanno's."}
{"text":"Let me clarify - I ate here at 4am.

The pizza itself was very good.  I had the meat lovers and the bbq chicken pizza.  Both were flavorful, packed with toppings and the crust was really good. I generally don't like the crust but I definitely like it at Bonanno's.

The downside of this place? Each slice was close to $7.  Yes, I said it - $7! 

I proceeded to order 4 slices - haha.

I think it would have been cheaper if I just ordered a whole pizza but who has that type of logic at 4am? 

Not sure if I'd here during the day but definitely a late night hot spot."}
{"text":"warmed up fat-dripping pizzas with a VERY uncommon seasoning in the meat lovers version..."}
{"text":"I can't eat pizza but Ive been craving it all day, so I figured I would cheat on my diet and indulge in a single slice. Just one!

Their pizza looked fresh and delicious, despite sitting out ready to be ordered by the slice. My mouth was watering as I waited to be helped...

A minute passed...and then another...does anyone work here?  Impatient and desperate to satisfy my craving I peeked my head over the counter to discover the only employee taking a huge bite of a slice of pizza.  With a full mouth, he tried to utter \"I'll be right there.\"  I turned around and walked out.  I lost my appetite. 

:("}
{"text":"We ate here during our trip to Las Vegas while staying at the MGM Grand. It's the perfect place for late night eating. After walking the strip and watching the Bellagio fountains, we would stop by here on the way back to our hotel room. It never disappointed. The pizza and calzone was delicious and the sauce was very flavorful. The prices were reasonable and to this day we still talk about it. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, but horrible tasting pizza. Bland flavorless pizza. The Cesar salad comes as a mound of harshly torn romain, with a small side of dressing even the packing doesn't make sense. The salad was hard to eat and had no substance. The Stromboli I order looked amazing tasted rubbery and gross. Overall the only perk was the beer. Out of all the places to eat in DT Summerlin avoid this one"}
{"text":"Garlic knots are delicious. However, the pizza isn't the best. It was food court quality and I wouldn't have it again. $5 for a slice a pizza...not worth it!

My sister-in-law ordered a salad...there were two salads on the menu; Caesar salad and a side salad. Since she doesn't like Caesar dressing, she ordered the side salad...then asked what kind of dressing they have...they only have Caesar lol. So basically, they have two sizes...not two different salads."}
{"text":"Their pizza is a hit and miss. Sometimes it is real good. But at other times it is not worth it. The price is right and a life saver, the next time you in a hurry and are hungry. They sold the Italian restaurant next door. Which in a way was a blessing. They made an excuse to sit me in their restaurant because I was in an electric wheel chair. When most of the place is outside anyway. I could made a fuss but it wasn't worth my time."}
{"text":"Closes at 2. Needs to be updated . Employees appear quite stuck up to be frank"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. We started drinking an hour or more ago so this place was spot on to help with the \"I'm a tourist drinking and need some fast food to help\" and it was great!!"}
{"text":"The only positive thing about Bonanno's is its availability after 2am.  Sadly, it's a pretty awful excuse for a pizzeria.  Even Sbarro's would have been more desirable.  Once again, dining by necessity.  [Original Visit: November 6, 2010]"}
{"text":"Decent quick-lunch option in Downtown Summerlin, they sell by the pie or by the slice. Snagged a $4 pepperoni slice, decent crust but not the thin and foldable type I expected with NY in the name. I appreciated that the slice wasn't too greasy, but didn't really like the way they reheated it. Layout of interior does not facilitate any sort of line, but they do have some outdoor seating available.

Note that they have a Yelp check in offer for $1 off purchase over $5- do yourself a favor and order a slice plus a garlic knot (too carby for me), and with the discount it's actually less than the slice alone. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I was drooling when our whole pizza popped out of the oven and made its way to our table.

First of all this is not your thick breaded pizza, and puffed out crusts, please go somewhere else if that's what you want. 

I would also like to say that getting a whole pizza here is worth more of your buck than if you were to order a slice and drink. Go big or go home right? Just kidding! But getting a freshly baked pizza makes a total difference than the pizza already made for order.
The bread is thin, but just right that it holds all the gooey goodness of cheese and toppings on top. 
We ordered a supreme whole pizza, and there was a generous amount of cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and everything else. You have the option of having it cut in 8, 12, or 16 slices. 
Pizza took about 15-20 minutes to be made/baked. 
Not bad, we just sipped away at our drinks and enjoyed sitting outside in Downtown Summerlin.
I came with a party of four and there were still leftovers!

I think this place is perfect for your pizza cravings and meal break in-between your shopping. Give it a try next time!"}
{"text":"Not a bad pizza, generous sized slices and fresh ingredients. I had the pepperoni slice and the mushroom, equal sized slices fresh and delicious crust, pepperoni was a bit stingy on the pepperoni. My mushroom sliced pizza had a grnerous serving of mushroom but the pizza was a tad bland. Overall acceptable and affordable."}
{"text":"Wait was quick which was the only positive of this place. Maybe people already realized this place isn't so great.

The food is kind of pricey and it is definitely not worth it. The pizza and pasta both tasted bland and the bread was generic at best. At first glance it looks really good but looks can only go so far (same with love) lol. This reminds me of a girl that I know, pretty on the outside but disgusting in the inside.

I definitely do not recommend this place. Save your money and get something that tastes better and is cheaper. I would recommend McDonald's over this."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and cold beer. Small place with limited seating but worth the trip. Pizza by the slice or a whole giant pizza. Nothing in between. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I can't say much good our bad about this place.  It WAS pizza but was quite possibly the most bland pizza I've ever had. I had the pepperoni and I just can't figure out how it had so little flavor in every aspect - crust,  meat, sauce,  and cheese.

It's be ok if it was just somewhere else,  but here you pay the Vegas premium price. Darn."}
{"text":"When we first started going here we were so happy to find a pizza place that was close to REAL NY pizza.  The past two times we've been really disappointed. Don't know if they changed the flour or started using \"Vegas\" water but the change is noticeable. We are going to give it one more shot somewhere in the near future & if it hasn't improved we will NOT re"}
{"text":"WOW, great friendly service, and the pizza, WOW, all I can say is the BEST !
The crust, cheese and sauce were freakin delish! 
As a new yorker, I know my pizza !!"}
{"text":"The most mediocre overpriced pizza I've ever tasted. Garlic knots aren't bad though. Sometimes a little bland, sometimes too much garlic, but once in a while they get it right."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic NY pizza then you'll find it here . 
My wife and I were going to the movies and decided to have real food rather than theatre food . 
Bonannos is right next to the movies which made it super convenient. 
My wife ordered a  slice of mushroom and I has a pepperoni slice . 
Both came hot hot with a great combination of cheese and crunch on the crust .  
We highly recommend this real pizza parlor right in Summerlin ."}
{"text":"I had the sausage and  pepper Stromboli. Not only was it small for the price but the sausages were thinner than paper and it was still cold on the outside. It lacked flavor and sausage. I only got this because nothing else in the food court looked appealing. I love eating bread and dipping it in the marinara sauce but the marinara was diluted. I might give the pizza a try if I need something quick but this would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"I'm originally from NY. It's pricey, mainly because it's located in a casino. However the pizza was surprisingly good. Could almost rival East Coast Pizza."}
{"text":"I'm at the one at Palace station and they used canned mushrooms!!! Ewwwww boooo this place is weeeaaakkkkkk!!!

But the crust is good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their pizza. I ordered the stuff supreme pizza and was not disappointed. If you're at shopping at the Summerlin mall, this is a nice place to stop and grab a NY style pizza."}
{"text":"It was ok, the sauce needed more garlic, thin crust was nice, but overall wasn't impressed... You think for summerlin it might be better... i wont be back,"}
{"text":"you can't really mess up pepperoni pizza at 1am....they also had a 'garlic knot' think Round tables 'garlic twist' in a ball. With some marinara sauce that was to die for....at least at 1 in the morning."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast here in the AM, right next door to the McDonald's counter and Italian-type meals at lunch, mostly pizza, pasta, salads.  
The food's OK, nothing spectacular and defintely costs more than McDonald's with breakfast entrees running about $9.  There are seats and booths in the common eating area adjoining the other 2-3 fast food places."}
{"text":"The pizza is good for a quick bite, but the service, even a simple greeting sucks... I know I have tattoos and it's a busy Las Vegas food court but show some effort. Ha"}
{"text":"I can make it short: crazy prices ($6-8 per plan slice). But the pizza is good. So I will give them 2 stars. I asked the person who work at the cashier why it is so expensive. She answered: this is vegas. Well. I guess it is what it is. I was starving and craving for pizza. I am not sure it worthies $25 for 3 slices."}
{"text":"The pizza crust was cardboard.  If it wouldn't have been 3:00AM, and if I would have been sober I would have thrown it away.  The place gives NY pizzerias a bad name."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not the best either. Good for a quick and easy fix since there is one in practically every casino. 

A slice will run you about $8, a SLICE. You heard right. Back home I can get the entire pizza pie for that price. To be expected in a casino, though. I had the tomato basil slice with a garlic knot and soda for $14. Not too bad. Was a filling dinner that didn't break the bank. 

If you're looking for a good on-the-go pizza joint on the strip, I recommend Five50 at Aria."}
{"text":"$7 for a big slice of horribly greasy and bland pizza. It was fast and convenient since it's located right next to the Blue Man Group stage, but I'd say you're much better off with McDonalds next door. The service was also horrible!! There was no one waiting in front of us but we still waited a few minutes to be acknowledged by the staff that was too busy talking to each other. When I finally made eye contact with one of the workers, she responded with, \"Yes?\" Wow. 

Don't go here."}
{"text":"Okay pizza for a baller price. 

I ordered a slice of pizza which pep and sausage for$5! So I automatically thought this pizza has to be amazing. 

Nope. It was just your average thin pizza. The pizza wasn't even hot and has been probably sitting under the lamps for a while. 

The slice did have a plus side. The breading had a nice crisp when you took a bite. 

Other than that, I'll pass on this place."}
{"text":"We got a slice of pepperoni, cheese and the stuffed spinach and broccoli pizza. The pizza was okay but the stuffed pizza was amazing. Packed full of flavor and very filling."}
{"text":"Drunk or sober every time I stay at the MGM, I HAVE to eat here! IT'S A MUST! This pizza place is the reason why I wasn't hungover this past weekend. Eating pizza at 4am then passing out with no regrets AT ALL. 

The mushroom pizza was alright but the plain cheese pizza right out of the oven was godly! Didn't even care if I burnt my tongue. I actually ate it 3 out of 4 nights I stayed at the MGM lol so worth it. Take me back to their pizza!"}
{"text":"Walked in and the employee was texting on her cell phone. I was not acknowledged or greeted so I stood there and stared at her as she continued to text away. 

Then her coworker (the cook) came out and greeted me which seemed to snap her back to reality as she jumped, stashed her phone away, and says \"what can I get you?\" No sorry, hello.. Nothing. The two then laugh amongst themselves. She also didn't listen - I said I wanted a bottled water and she poured water from the tap in a to-go cup. I had to re-ask for a cold bottled water from the fridge. 

The plus.. The pizza is very good.. Big slice, a lot of flavor. 2 stars is for the customer service.. But the pizza is 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not really the greatest pizza place. The marinara doesnt really taste like marinara... But overall not bad... Dont know if I'd come here again tho..."}
{"text":"Pizza was good and warm. Was a little disappointed they didn't have garlic knots but food was fine. Staff was friendly and helpful with the chef could use a brush up on his customer service skills"}
{"text":"Great for late night snack. It wasn't the best pizza I've had but keep in mind it's in a food court:) It was a decent slice that hit the spot when not many other places were open and was right in the casino. The garlic knots were also pretty good too. We ate here more than once on our week long stay. The staff was helpful and friendly and they worked fast to move through the line of customers. The prices were decent too. Check this place out if you're looking for a quick bite. It's not only good for soaking up the alcohol before bed but also helps with a hangover;) I think they were one of the places that stayed open longer than the other places in the food court."}
{"text":"I was searching for a quick breakfast when I noticed a line of people at this pizzeria. They had converted over to a breakfast menu for early morning customers. I ordered the Belgian waffle combo not sure of what to expect. My waffle was freshly cooked and the syrup was heated to help melt the butter. The only negative is the bacon was burned a little to much. Overall I was pleased with the quality of the breakfast, and I waited less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Stopped by 30 minutes before close and got a slice of pepperoni. I swear frozen pizza at Albertson's tastes better than this. Also there were only 5 pieces of pepperoni. Pizza Hut tastes better than this..."}
{"text":"I am local and I don't go on the strip much. However, when I get tired of Subway salads in my local neighborhood, I come here with my son to grab a Caesar Salad. They have the best Caesar salad dressing I ever tasted and it's worth driving to get. I can't find anything like it even on the grocery store shelf. I want to take this moment to thank the manager \"Joshua Tree\", for ensuring fresh salad was being served for the customers. I told him that I was a regular and the previous salad I ordered that day was not their usual, and he wasted no time replacing it. He even seem proud to replace it for me. This is quality management and very impressive leadership. He did not give me an attitude also. He also made it up by only charging my half price for my salad. I will be back and feel good about this being my permanent spot for good Caesar Salad. Good job Joshua!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even know why I'm generous enough to give two stars when in fact they should only get one. I was born with Italian tastebuds and can tell you, eating their foods would've been an insult to the Italian public. 

The strombolini lacked so much flavor you'd need extra salt or seasoning. Perhaps one gallon of marinara dipping sauce would've done so to compensate for the boring bread and cheese in between. 

The spaghetti was watery. The kind of tomato water you didn't want squirting out of your Heinz ketchup bottle watery. The meatball was FROZEN and only half way cooked. 

And those parmesan butter knots? KNOT so good either. Tastebuds unapproved!!"}
{"text":"As we waited for our food to be warmed up we watched the cashier stand at the register picking up ice cubes from a cup, put them in her mouth, suck or chew a couple times, spit the remainder into her bare hand and then toss aside onto the floor behind her. Swipe a card, give receipt and put more ice in her mouth and repeat the process. Absolutely the most disgusting thing I've ever seen happen in a food establishment. If that's what's happening in front of all customers and coworkers I can only imagine what's happening behind the scenes."}
{"text":"Easy cheap late night meal. Good affordable vegas food. Recommend staying with pepperoni. Line can be long late night. Great customer service"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. Service is great especially Rick. Great atmosphere. Garlic knots are delicious too. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Rubbery cheese, greasy pizza. Less than adequate late night bite with the shocking price tag to match. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, not expensive and friendly staff! highly recommend. 
Tried mushroom and veggie pizza! both were pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good NY style Italian Food & Pizza...outdoor patio & bar tables...delicious garlic knots on the table along with a mini antipasto...we shared a Margarita pizza, Chicken Parmagian & Penne ALa Vodka"}
{"text":"Around the corner from the CSI Experience we visit a food court for a slice of NYC style thin crust pie and some garlic knots at Bonanno's New York Pizzeria.  Garlic knots are pieces of moderately soft baked bread which are twisted into a knot shape and have garlic, basil or other herbs, salt and grated parmesan or Romano cheese sprinkled on them.  The pizza crust is quite thin and crispy.  The tomato sauce is lightly applied and the cheese quality is pretty good.  Afterwards we head back to the room to relax for a bit.  This isn't nearly the best NYC pie I've had...have to go NYC for that...but this makes very nice thin crust pie eating."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a week day. They seem slightly understaffed with only 2 people and when we ordered pizza that was already made, it took a while for them to heat all 4 of our pizzas up with also helping other people.
HOWEVER, the pizza here was delicious! Just like the NE. 
Thin crust, crunchy, very little cheese- could have more, a couple of pepperoni. But absolutely delicious! Prices are a little high with the following:

Main slice: 3.95$
Pepperoni: 4.45$
Gourmet pizza: 4.95$
Stuffed slice: 5.95$
Stromboli: 7.95$

Whole pizza: 22.95$
Stuffed pizza: 24.95$

The crust is just the right thickness! and Pizza is all about the crust!
The ranch sauce on the side is recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome choice for the late night munchies!  I've lived in NYC for 24 years so I have pretty high standards for what I want in a slice, and the bacon slice I got here wasn't too far off the mark!  My friend and I got the bacon slice (and a side of ranch to pour all over it) and 6 garlic knots.  The slice was actually quite heavy, cheesey, and dripping in its own oils which is a must if you're claiming that the pizza is New York style.  The garlic knots were quite delicious as well!  They were pretty huge and incredibly soft.  Could have used a bit more garlic, but the texture made up for that.  I dipped these in the ranch as well even though they do come with marinara.  While the food was satisfying, the prices were a bit too high.. I paid about 16$ for that one slice and the garlic knots.  That's Vegas for you though, I'd still come back at midnight for more!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Especially when you have a large crowd at 4am! I had the pepperoni pizza and it was delicious. Not too much bread, just the right amount.

They don't have RANCH! who does that??  But Johnny Rockets right next door will glady give you ranch for your pizza pleasures lol

I think this place was pretty affordable and good for the drunken snack!"}
{"text":"Fast, consistent, and delicious. 

The pizzas are sitting under a heat lamp but when you order theyll grab your slice and pop it in the oven for a minute or two. This makes the cheese nice and gooey and the crust crunchy. Yum."}
{"text":"I go here all the time, and I love their pizza. The reason why they get 3 stars is the service. They are so slowwwwwww. I don't get it. I usually order for pick up, and how is it that 25-30 mins later I arrive and my pizza order is not done. It's a regular cheese pizza not a full blown 3 course meal that I am ordering. Also when your ordering over the phone it's like the person taking the order is always spaced out."}
{"text":"I'd rate it a 3.5 if Yelp let me. So we were walking around after we went to get some things and decided to try this place out. It has a nice out door sitting area and inside there's some more seating. 

The girl working (Marbella I think?) wasn't that friendly. She seemed like she didn't want to be there. I asked to Doctor Pepper since they only have Pepsi products and she responded saying \"it's been tasting flat all day.\" Okay? Go change out the syrup? I'd understand if they were out of that but if you have it and purposely don't change it, that's just lazy. We were asking what kind of energy drinks they have (only rockstar) and she responded \"it's not part of the special.\" We know. Thats not what we asked you. Smiling every once in a while wouldn't hurt either. 

They have beer so it's always good. Mostly domestics but they do have Fat Fire so that caught my attention. You can buy a pizza for $20 or buy it by the slice. They have Stromboli's for $8 so we decided to try two slices and split a Stromboli. 2 slices and a drink for $8, not bad. Especially since the slices are too big to even lift! 

Now we got cheese pizza since that was the special. The marinara sauce needed some salt. It was great besides that. The Stromboli was really good. Amazing amount of cheese (never too much cheese) and pepperoni but also needed some salt. When I added salt, everything came together so much more. We both agreed that the Stromboli was better than the pizza itself! I enjoyed this place. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Me And the manly men that we are hanging at level up. During the discussion of manly topics we saw the pizza place and decided to try it out. We as hungry men loved the buffalo chicken pizza. Want RANCH with a side of pizza?!? As usual I have to have 10 cups of ranch per slice of pizza and they obliged like loyal ranch giving servants that they are I just literally could not be happier, but we unlike usual because these pizza slices were insanely massive were too stuffed on cheesy, chickeny goodness that we just absolutely could not try the gelato that was promised by the help behind the counter. I'm not exactly sure what gelato is. Is it gel? Is it ato? What the hell is ato? Still I'm more than certain that if any desert deserves to be put in my mouth it has to be that. They were displaying it so sexily it just CANT be bad! The only problem here really is that I haven't adapted a second stomach so I could eat more of this Jesus given food. I will definitely be returning to eat this gelato. Come to think about it actually writing this post makes me want this food more. I just want to go back and have more manly visits with my manly friends to eat this manly food it is absolutely glorious. Thank you thank you"}
{"text":"I work close by and I often go to the Luxor's food court for lunch. This place always has good food, but the service is always awful. I always expect to get ignored by whomever is the cashier, or I get a dirty look from them as soon as they acknowledge my existence. Today for example, I ordered my food right away because there was no line, but as soon as I got to the cashier, she ignored me for at least two minutes because she was too busy watching a video that one of the cooks was showing her on her phone. All my co-workers agree that they're always super rude. Don't expect a thank you either."}
{"text":"I came here at 1:06am and ordered a pie of pepperoni pizza and the \"supervisor\" on duty claimed it was going to be 35mins. They brought out a fresh pie of pizza and claimed it was for the table. They had no customers, and because they didn't feel like making it that moment i had to wait 35mins. There were 6 people on duty, two females and 4males and they weren't doing anything. The \"Supervisor\" was making boxes and snickering while the rest of the staff was disrespectful and nasty. I returned 20mins later and they said I had to wait another 20 mins for a pie of pizza. When I complained Megan told me  the 2 people taking the money (herself and the so called supervisor) were not \"pizza makers\". What a terrible establishment and lack of customer service. I would very much like to speak to the owner to find out if he knows what kind of establishment and customer service his employees are providing. I do not believe that any business man in his right mind would be so inclined to accept this. Especially when the restaurant is located in such a well known establishment such as MGM Hotel Las Vegas. I'm am appalled and disgusted by these people. I wouldn't be surprised if they spit on my pizza or worse. For $37.50 a pie or 7$ a slice one would think that they would be more respectful to their customers. Among the staff was a Misael as well.  I invite the owner to contact me so that I can tell him directly. I would not recommend this establishment due to the lack of customer service and disrespect these employees have for their customers."}
{"text":"Almost forgot to give a review on this place!!  Came here in early February on a party weekend with some old buddies.  I was rolling through MGM on my way to the last tower and dying for some food, so I decided to try Bonanno's.  The pizza was ok, somewhat New York style, but a cheaper version.  As I always say \"A Good Pizza is Always Based on the Sauce and Size of the Crust.\"  Now these guys delivered on the crust, but still lack on the sauce.    If your in a hurry and just need something to eat, then go for it, but if your looking for die hard New York pizza, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I don't have the excuse of being drunk at 3am to justify purchasing food from here; I was just hungry. And you'd think I'd want to avoid greasy carb bombs before having to get in a bathing suit, but no -- I ordered a slice of mushroom AND a garlic knot & ate both upstairs in my friend's lovely hotel room. #zeroregrets 

Typical food court pizza that's sat for hours before being reheated: $6. Avoiding being hangry & maintaining my sunny disposition for my friends: they'd definitely call that priceless."}
{"text":"The pizza was decent, and the price made sense regarding the location and portions. A bit greasy, but the crust was great - crunchy but not too crunchy or dry. 
We ordered 2 different toppings for a whole pizza so we waited about 20 minutes. It came in a box and we took our leftovers in a to-go box. 
Would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Inside the MGM food court.
I'm not a fan of pizza but when you need  late night grub, this is the place.
It's a better deal to order a whole pizza, which is huge and fresh made to order.

The garlic bread is tasty with the marinara sauce. :)

See photo."}
{"text":"One star and only because I had to!  Not very busy but they still mixed up the two orders ahead of us. I ordered one slice of pizza and they tried giving it to a couple customers ahead of me!  They were working on the ceiling tiles all the time I was there. Decided all that was not worth it so we left. Don't know how it would have tasted but from other reviews I didn't miss anything."}
{"text":"Overcooked to begin with and outrageously expensive: two things that characterize this pizza joint. While food in Vegas is generally not that cheap, for a place in a food court, you would come to expect a certain level of quality and price associated with fast food. This establishment fell far below even our lowest standards and we actually wish we went to the next door McDonalds instead. 

In terms of what was actually wrong with the Pizza, the crust and main body was overcooked, tough, and drier than Vegas soil. The toppings were sparse to begin with and were also overcooked. This really gross slice of pizza cost $6.95 but really should have been on the dollar section of a run down pizza joint. 

The employees were surly, curt, and were the nail in the coffin for this review. Please save your money, your stomach, and your time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I can't believe i chose this place for a quick meal in Vegas! It was terrible! the meat in the Stromboli wasn't cooked and this stuff could've been old because it made me feel very uneasy after i had it. The service is not that impressive either!"}
{"text":"Had the supreme pizza and a Stromboli. Not sure what the Stromboli was, maybe I'm just not used to there being onions and peppers in a Stromboli. It also had too much cheese compared to what I'm used to. Least favorite Stromboli I've ever had. The pizza supreme was average at best. Papa johns would've been better."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a piece of pizza and a Stromboli while we were waiting for a show to start. The food was average and cost just over $25 for a piece of pizza, one Stromboli, and a water."}
{"text":"This is your typical counter-serve pizza brick-oven, they say NYC-style pies and they also have pasta & chicken dishes. It was a late night of business events with lots of talking and some drinking and I realized that I had eaten nothing for dinner. What I usually do when in NYC is order a pizza pie. Well behold, there was a food court with a Pizza Parlor in it. Not bad for Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I must say the buffalo chicken pizza is deliciously. I was a little upset that they didn't have any ranch salad dressing."}
{"text":"Good Stromboli.  Probably best place to eat that won't break the bank at downtown summerlin."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Really expensive and they messed up my order. Pizza was ok, pasta was cold. But make sure to open the box before you leave. Really nice people but really bummed they mess up the order. I never complain so just giving you the heads up"}
{"text":"The pizza here was nothing special. For the price I paid for the pizza slice, the taste was decent but nothing I had not tried before. There is not a lot of room to sit inside the restaurant. Not a place I would usually go to. I would only come back if it was my only option of food."}
{"text":"Over priced and low quality. Normal Vegas markup so everything is overpriced but this pizza is worse than frozen generic store brand"}
{"text":"Great value. Delicious pizza. And you can customize it how ever you want. Friendly staff as well. They have a decent sense of humor and decorated the place as such. Best $12 pizza."}
{"text":"Not bad, overpriced food court pizza, but everything is overpriced when you're in the casino anyway. The pizza was big and was edible, so I'd say it's ok. I was hungry and I enjoyed it. When you're eating casino food, you always have to lower your standard just a little bit then you won't be too upset...

At least it's a quick bite in the conference hall."}
{"text":"We workout outside and smell this pizza 10 laps around the mall and we decided to try it!  It was expensive but very much worth the price because the staff here had fabulous manners.  I was so happy we tried this little place, I would recommend their establishment to a friend for a NY style pizza in Downtown Summerlin.

My regular place is far near Trop and Duneville but I could see coming here just for their pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and were at Mandalay Bay for a show. We had some extra time and decided to get a quick bite. We decided on Bonanno's. I'm not expecting superior quality from a place in the food court, but I do expect it to not taste like crap. I should have known when I saw the pizzas. They looked like they had been under the heat lamps for at least a couple hours. We ordered 2 slices and a bottle of water. That was ~$20. The cashier then reheated the slices in the pizza oven.

 The slices that came out were devoid of taste and were in fact reheated. The crust was reminiscent of cardboard, just not as tender or tasty. There are better fast food joints in the food court, so I will not throw another penny their way."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!! Too bad I can't give ZERO STARS!  You would think I walked up and asked for my food to be free. I ordered  2 slices of pizza and my 7 year old asked for pasta and wanted to substitute the marinara sauce for the  grated Parmesan cheese they have displayed next to the pizza and salads.. WELL turned out they couldn't give me any of the cheese on display only their old, gross, prepackaged cheese which they claimed was the same.  No it wasn't.  So I ask nicely and say, my daughter really doesn't like the marinara sauce nor the prepackaged cheese can I please just get some of the cheese you have here on the pasta?  And they shut me down told me no and that was that. So my husband pays for the food and they end up over charging him.. really?? On top of bad customer service you have dummies at the register?? I will never eat there again.  If they can't add the grated cheese they have displayed then why have it there?? Isn't that what it's for? To put on the food I'm paying for!!"}
{"text":"Every review is tinted by circumstances.  In reality, this is probably an average fast food joint, but after paying more than $40 for a lunch at Rainforest Cafe earlier in the day and having to make a couple of emergency stops at random restrooms afterward, it was reassuring to have flavorful food that allowed my stomach to remain calm and my wallet to remain thicker."}
{"text":"This is not New York style pizza! It may look like it but it doesn't taste anything like it. The quality of the cheese on the regular cheese pizza was terrible and I could not eat it."}
{"text":"Convenient and shockingly good pizza!

When shopping you're normally looking for something quick and this fits the bill!

Been here a dozen times and will continue the trend"}
{"text":"Irwin is the man he hooked it up for your boy. Anytime you come to Vegas and stand in the MGM and it's late night and you drunk come to this piece of spot and talk to Irwin he going to hook you up and make sure you good."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Eat elsewhere. I went to this place for a pepperoni slice because I was fooled by the look and how long the line was. I finally got my slice and was not impressed at all. The crust was really soggy and soft, and the sauce was average pizza sauce from a can. I have no clue why they had a long line for this crap. I will not waste my time going there again. Pizza Hut tastes better than that."}
{"text":"As good as frozen pizza from the grocery aisle. Mushroom pizza had a few pieces of canned or previously frozen mushrooms. Mushrooms were soggy, ugly and tasteless. And all three employees behind the counter do not greet you nor do they thank you for your patronage. Maybe the service is the only thing that is authentic New York style?"}
{"text":"Overpriced and flavorless pizza. $4.00 drinks n the stuff looks n tastes like it's been sitting out for hours. Should have gotten a cheesesteak next door."}
{"text":"Meh, all I can say is that it's decent pizza at a pretty damn high price. I paid over $10 for a slice of pepperoni and a cream soda. While it's not really New York style or \"fresh from the kitchen,\" it was pretty good. But damn, even for food court food, it's still expensive."}
{"text":"By far some of the best New York Style Pizza I have had!
I went in expecting to just eat some normal pizza but was extremely surprised when I saw how delicious the pizza was.
To top it all off i was greeted by some young men that were just the kindest I ment in vegas 
They were really helpful by helping me deside what to eat s\o to these funny out going gentlemen 
Thanks alot 
Definitely can't wait to be back next week to eat some more bomb food!!!

{"text":"The worst smallest ny pizza I ever had.   The pizza was okay. Got a veggie slice.  But two slices and water for 28 dollars it better be big and good.  We walked away hungry.  Ended up with room service later on."}

{"text":"Late night eats in the food court at MGM. They are open until 4am and on weekend nights, this place gets packed late at night when people start leaving the club. 

Pizza here is actually quite pricey... but late at night, there's not too many options. Pizza is about $7 a slice and a whole pizza is $34. I've eaten here a few times due to the convenience. Pizza here is just okay. I can easily name a bunch of pizza places that tastes much better. Pizza here is the thin crust type, but you can also order stuffed pizza, stromoli's and various pastas. I've only eaten the pizza. For $7, the slice is on the bigger side. It can satisfy your stomach, hold you over until you get more food... but by no means will fill you up if you are hungry.  

Most recently, my boyfriend and I ordered a whole pizza and after taxes, it was about $37. If you ordered each slice individually, it would be almost $50 ($7/slice times 8 slices=$48+ taxes) We figured, since we were staying at The Signature and had a fridge and microwave, we could heat it up to eat later instead of buying something each night. The pizza was big. We ordered a meat lovers, which honestly could use more meat. They really skimped on the toppings and when we asked about mushrooms, we were told it was $3 extra!! We passed as that was expensive for just one topping! The bread side crust was crispy, but the crust under the pizza was not and the slice was limp when you picked it up. As far as tasted, it just tasted okay... nothing that stood out in flavor. Like I said, it was a skimpy pizza, even for a meat lovers...

Would I eat here again... only late at night when I'm really hungry staying at MGM and too lazy to walk out to the strip to get something better. However, compared to the Mexican food place that is in the food court... this pizza place is by far better. 

The workers... the guys that did the pizza were nicer than the cashier girl who seemed irritated with people. 

This pizza place will satisfy you when you have late night hunger, but by no means should you go out of your place to eat here. The prices and food quality are not worth it."}
{"text":"I tried the Stromboli based on topher p's review.  The Stromboli, when paired with a finer Pepsi product, is a great way to finish the night"}
{"text":"If you're getting vegetarian stuff or prefer it I'd suggest against getting it here.

I had gotten a mushroom slice and some kinda vegetarian slice with tomato, broccoli, and spinach on it. Both slices were semi old, the vegetarian slice being the oldest. Both should've been heated more, heat seems to be inconsistent in the oven. The mushroom was okay with the mushrooms being a little chewy due to the age. The vegetables on the vegetarian slice were atrocious; the broccoli and the spinach were dry and brittle. The crust on the vegetarian being the oldest was incredibly chewy especially not being cooked enough. 

Just get the meat ones since those pizzas get shuffled through much more quickly. The sausage looked quite good when I was looking. Those are probably better if you're going to eat here. It wasn't inedible, but that shouldn't be a consolation."}
{"text":"Slice of meat-lover's pizza tastes great at 2am after a night of drinking. It's a large slice, and only $4. Best deal in the MGM."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars! 
I've been craving pizza from back home. I wanted a slice with a little grease on it, the cheese melted perfectly, a slightly sweet sauce and the crust cooked so perfectly, when you fold it, the bottom lip falls over. I wasn't expecting much. The pizza looked like it was out maybe 5-7 minutes and I generally don't like the way they reheat, but since it was quick, it came out quite delicious! I'd prefer a little sweeter sauce, but all in all, it was pretty good. I imagine a fresh pie would be even better. It was $3.45 for a plain slice, but it's Downtown Summerlin, so it's to be expected. They didn't have a take home menu, and they dont offer much else besides pizza. I'd suggest coming around lunch or dinnertime when the pizza should be kinda fresh. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"What a terrible slice of pizza! I just got off of a long flight and was super hungry. This pizza was hands down the worst piece of food I've ever eaten. The tomato sauce tasted only like tomato paste,  no other flavor,  herbs,  nothing. The crust was totally boring, the cheese boring, the whole place,  boring. I can't believe they can even exist as a restaurant. Please someone,  tell the chef,  the owner,  whoever to eat their own food once in awhile so they know what it tastes like."}
{"text":"Late night pizza that's just a walk away? Uh why not?! I definitely read a couple of mediocre reviews but it's pizza...kind of hard to mess up. I am definitely reminded of Sbarro's pizza. Which I have no complaints about. They are open until 4am and I got there at 2:30am so there wasn't much choices. I got a slice of spinach & mushroom pizza for about $7. What can I say? It's Vegas prices. Expect to pay that much! I have no complaints. I'm a happy customer. :) I'll probably go earlier for more selection next time."}
{"text":"Pizza was tasteless.  It wouldn't be bad if I was drunk, but I wasn't"}
{"text":"Very nice location and the staff here is very friendly. The pizza itself is very good. The crust is cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crisp. The toppings are plentiful, fresh, and good quality. I especially like that they have Dr Browns Root Beer.

Tasty all round."}
{"text":"Too expensive for a paper sheet pizza, employees are rude an the flavor of the pizza not the best so if you want a good pizza avoid this place."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such bad reviews. Sure, I'm a little bummed that I didn't yelp it and get to eat at the higher rated pizza shop, \"Project Pie\" downstairs, but I didn't think the pizza here was bad. My boy and I were coming back from a concert at the MGM Garden Arena and saw this place open around 11. We thought we might as well go here over \"Nathan's.\" We weren't sure if we'd be able to find food elsewhere. We were tired and ready to go back to our room. FYI this place is located in the MGM Grand, so if you are staying here it's a good option for a quick bite to eat if you don't want to walk out onto the strip. 

FOOD: (4 stars)
I ordered a slice of Pepperoni Pizza.
-Thin and crispy crust.
-Flavorful, cheese seemed good quality.
-Pizza came out at a good temperature.
-This pizza tasted better than Sbarro's to me (has thicker crust and crappier ingredients).

PRICE and OTHER THINGS: (2 stars)
-Vegas Prices, Expensive ($20+ if you want two entrees and 2 drinks) I think the slice of pizza was about $6
-Could not find the utensils. Maybe they were all gone at the food court condiment bar by 11 pm. I had to go to \"Nathan's\" to ask for some. 
-food court ambiance- enough said.

Overall, I think the pizza tastes pretty good, was quick, and was our cheapest meal in Vegas. Perhaps, there are better deals out there for pizza, but I don't go to Vegas often, so I didn't know my options."}
{"text":"Great spot for a slice. Conveniently located in Downtown Summerlin. Fast and great service. Delicious slice."}
{"text":"What a complete let down. Over priced pizza and the service was a joke. I watched as the pizza slices I ordered were slowly dying because the workers mixed up orders. While three customers ahead of me were served my order, which was incorrect, they tried to quickly make their order of pasta. Finally we got up to the register and I asked if they could please warm our order up as I watched it getting cold for at least 7-10 minutes. The cashier seemed upset that I requested this and offered no apologies. Unimpressed and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"A Sbarro by any other name ... Located in the Las Vegas MGM Grand, I was expecting above average Italian fare. I think my $4 soda was the best part of the meal. Garlic knots were okay. Pepperoni Stomboli? Meh."}
{"text":"Bought a  sausage Stromboli with salad.  The salad was very good. The Stromboli was amazingly disappointing. The sausage was bland, the cheese was lukewarm and rubbery, and the bread was crunchy on the outside but squishy on the inside almost like uncooked dough.  there wasn't anything else identifiable in it like olives or vegetables or other meats. Rather pricey too. Next time I will just order food and have Uber deliver it."}
{"text":"Love love love this pizza place.  There stuffed meat pizza and garlic knot rolls are the best!
I took one star off because the lady helping us was not at all friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the pizza is actually good. But totally not worth it because of the headache you get dealing with the staff at this location. I've encountered some of the rudest people on the phone. When I've ordered take out my pizza would be either cold (I'm assuming I'm getting an old pie) or not even in the oven. Again the pizza is good but dealing with the hit or miss (more miss then hit) type of service I'd say pass, save yourself the the head ache and go to another place."}
{"text":"Pizza and pasta sounded great but this was not good. I'm starting to realize I don't like New York style pizza. Pasta was quite clunky and pizza had no taste and far too greasy. Some may like it, but meh, not my thing. Far too expensive also"}
{"text":"Stopped in because we noticed the gelato sign. REEEEEEEALLY shouldn't have stopped here. I dunno what the owners of this place think gelato is supposed to be, but this wasn't it. While they had the flavor assortments, the texture was just completely jacked up: I realize we're technically in the desert, but gelato should never have a sandy texture."}
{"text":"I'm here for a conference so this place is super busy and everyone seems overworked. Perhaps this is why the pizza isn't that great? The pizza seemed over salty, the sauce wasn't that flavorful, and the crust was a bit too tough. For a New York style pizza place, it just doesn't do it for me. They do the sbaro thing and reheat your pizza after you order, maybe they need to heat it a bit longer too. 

If you're hungry near the Mandalay Bay conference center do yourself a favor and have something else instead."}
{"text":"Sick nasty. I had heard of a pizza place in MGM and silly me, I thought this was it. WRONG this is nasty old Sbarro rejects sitting waiting for drunkards to gobble. Cheese wasn't melted, taste was blah, crust flavorless. I will always pass up this. 

I hear the pizza in the basement on the way to the parking garage is excellent. The more you know!"}
{"text":"I mean, it's pizza, and I ate it, so it wasn't terrible, but I think there is a lot of room for improvement. The pizza was pretty big, and the price was good, but honestly, i think I have had better pizza at Dominos. For a snack, I recommend it. But for lunch, it's pretty mediocre. The actual interior of the shop was very crowded and small, and I could barely get to a table since they were so close together. They heat the individual slices for you in an oven, so when you get it it is really hot. The service was fine. If you are looking for a cheap snack in DTS then this is a pretty good place."}
{"text":"If you wanna order a whole pizza be there an hr and a half before closing because they won't accept orders 45minutes before they close... SMH"}
{"text":"Located inside the Flamingo Hotel's food court! I needed a quick bite to eat before bed, so I stopped by here. The service was decent, workers were friendly. The pizza didn't look too good though either. It's actually even more expensive than Secret Pizza! The pizza was not that tasty. I felt a bit ripped off and would rather spend my money on Secret Pizza than this!"}
{"text":"Average Pizza and price was about $10 for slice and small drink.  Grwat for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Terrible breakfast sandwiches.  They were chewy and tasted as if they'd been sitting for hours."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place in Las Vegas!! it is our #1 choice!!
 We only wish they delivered!! We love that we can get a HUGE slice of pizza and a soda for a very minimum price.  We eat here every chance we get when we are at the Summerlin mall and are never disappointed!!  
Bonanno's please get a delivery service!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go when you want something fast. Their pizza, salad and meatballs are really good. They are a bit pricey but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Fast Service .... In and Out. 

Located inside of the Flamingo Hotel and casino, I need to grab something to eat and whats better than pizza??? LOL The restaurant is basically located in a food court area with several other restaurants. 

I ended up ordering the stuff meat pizza served with a side of marinara sauce,  it was really yummy but instantly gave me heartburns. If you are in the area and need a quick, cheap, greasy fix.... This is your place. 

The staff was, kind and service was fast. I may check them out again."}
{"text":"It was a great morning for pizza and so here we are. The prices here reflect the touristy spot that it is located in but that does not mean much to me currently. There pizza at any of there many locations along the Las Vegas strip is amazing. Today the mushroom pizza was fresh so I ordered that. In addition ordered cheese slice and two garlic knots with ranch on the side for dipping. 

The cashier and cook were both highly professional and greeted me and thanked me for coming. There was not even a charge for the side of ranch. Mountain Dew goes best with pizza so that is what I decided on for the drink. The pizza was fresh and hot and paired with Mountain Dew is a great start to the day from drinking the night before."}
{"text":"At the event for Yelp at Level Up this pizza restaurant just calls to us. I asked one of my fellow Yelpers where he got that wonderful pizza from since not serving at Level. I was in line at Bonanno's when I discovered this. They allow the pizza from here to be eaten at Level. What could be better great pizza, beer, and video games. 

I had a slice of the white pizza and a garlic knot with ranch. They take a little longer to get there pizza but it was fresh and warm. I have had this pizza prior, so I am familiar with their products. There pizza is very cheesy and has a wonderful flavor. I believe that it is there tomato sauce and all that fabulous cheese that tinkles in your mouth"}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve a star. So we ordered 2 pizzas and 6 garlic knots. All food was still VERY cold... so we asked them to warm up the garlic knots and figured the pizza was luke warm so started eating some (I didn't even finish it). It all tasted good, but if it was warmed appropriately. Within a few hours I came back to the room. I started getting diarrhea. Then next morning, I started throwing up all day into the following morning. And of course I missed out on all our events. Lucky my boyfriend was okay so he was able to attend. 

So if you want diarrhea and vomiting this is the place to go. My trip is ruined."}
{"text":"Luxor location was convenient to the theater. Staff was helpful and friendly. Pizza was decent. Would go back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place was not built to be a pizza restaurant... It's super small so when there's a few people in line, the only place the line can go is out the door, where people are sitting and eating. Another weird thing I noticed was that the trash can opening didn't fit the plates that they serve the pizza on...It's like an 8-inch opening so you have to crack the plates in half to be able to throw them away... Very odd. The staff was young and rude, they seemed robotic. And last but not least, they didn't have cheese or pepper shakers. What kind of pizza place is this?! I asked for Parmesan cheese and she went under the counter and give me a packet. When I asked for two she roller her eyes lol. That was the last straw for me! There are plenty of other places to eat in downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I ordered one slice of pepperoni pizza which came up to $7 and one meat ball is $1.98 so I ended paying $10 and change. The slice of pizza wasn't good at all, it doesn't taste like New York style pizza. I had a stomach ache right after."}
{"text":"I was looking for some inexpensive late night grub when we were walking between the Linq and Flamingo. Bonanno's is located in a food court inside the Flamingo. Their menu is pretty much basic, there's of course pastas, salads, stromboli, whole pizza, and pizza by the slice. 

I ordered their pepperoni and mushroom pizza. My choice was considered gourmet topping and it was $7? With that, I ordered a large Pepsi $4. When looking for a Cheese pizza slice it's $5 and a Pepperoni slice is $6. 

I was standing in line waiting to pay, I noticed there were some confusion with a customer who was trying to pay at the cash register, then the line got held up, from there it got worst. There was a guy behind us who wanted to be out quick because all he had was one order. My party and I didn't mind him wanting to go ahead us because there were some orders that had to wait to be re-heated, so he went ahead of us. Still the line wasn't moving, that same guy got really upset and left. 

I noticed when food got prepared the employees were shuffling plates around behind the counter, I guess they were trying to figure out if everything is in order. Again, that also made service get even slower. After paying 8 minutes later I didn't get an apology about the delayed wait. By the time I got to my table I took a bite of my pizza, it got cold! I was upset, I didn't want to get back in line to ask to get it warmed up. I was like \"Forget it!\". Funny, later on that same customer who left came back and noticed he can never get helped and started complaining to other people, he cursed and went else where.

I spend so much time in this review about their service it affected others as well, and the end result I got was a cold pizza. Therefore, I didn't go banana's at Bonanno's. For better pizza by the slice I'd rather stick to Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"The workers weren't all there, I asked a few questions on what kind of pizza that was. They gave me a stare like a deer in headlights. Weren't that friendly, but overall the food was very good and little pricey but you get what you pay for. I had the garlic nots and cheese noodles."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Super overpriced and the staff is so rude. I will never shop here again."}
{"text":"Not every meal in Vegas is going to be over the top. Sometimes you just need a quick bite to eat after laying by the pool all day. 

Bonanno's is located at the Food Court in the District. It is convenient to the MGM Pool Complex. Also, they are open late(maybe 24 hours? They do serve breakfast)

Just had a quick slice of pizza, but it was delicious, cheap, and quick. Exactly what I was looking for. Great option for a late night snack too since most places in the area stop serving food around Midnight."}
{"text":"Tried Bonanno's for my first time while on lunch break for a Massage conference. First off, as a local I do have to say when reading the previous reviews, they were complaining about the price and you don't get much for what it's worth, it's the STRIP! Everywhere is like that unless you go off the strip and more into the local parts of town. And they do have prices on the menu. If it's expensive, whyd you eat there? Boggles my mind. 

Anyways, I thought the slice of Broccoli & Spinach Pizza was delicious. I've never had that combo before and it was very tasty. They even toast it again after it's been sitting under the head lamp which was nice. 

The slice was big in my opinion. The price, yeah pricey, but I expect that being in a casino on the strip. Wish I brought lunch from home, but oh well. 

Would I recommend if you want pizza, but don't want to leave the hotel? Definitely."}
{"text":"It's pizza and it's decent, not the best and not horrible. The thing is horrible is their service, it's TERRIBLE SERVICE even for food court standards!"}
{"text":"I ordered the tomato and basil pizza, and was pleased with the large size of the single slice option. The crust was good, the sauce was OK, but I certainly have had better tasting pizza. Other than that, it's a good quick option if you are on a budget."}
{"text":"I came to mgm for a convention and man this pizza is good . Wow im blown away by the service here . When i got to the table the food blew away my tastebuds i had side ceaser salad , and 2 slices of pepperoni . All thanks to robert this guy was amazing recommend all of the items. Friendly service i asked 1 million question he answered all of them .Carmen was the cashier she was sweet also,
Asked her a million questions she was happy to answer . Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a slice of pizza since January bc I'm on WW and the was FANTASTIC!
The girl behind the counter was polite and friendly despite the fact some RUDE customer decided to \"bark\" at her for something she had no control over I'm happy I chose Bonanno's for my \"cheat day \" lol
Thumbs up to the staff and food"}
{"text":"Ugh... was last choice but the lines were ridiculous every where else I looked.  Also wasn't going to pay $22+ a plate for the fresh asian fast food place next to it without a line (wonder why LOL).  I should have just sucked it up and stood in the line at Witchcraft and gotten a good sandwich to eat.

Positives
Pizza is made fresh there.

Negatives
Food quality sucks.
Way to expensive for the quality.

I had very low expectations and even then they couldn't meet them, in fact I got sick off my one slice of pizza.  I dont need my quality pool/drinking time interrupted by bathroom trips thank you!  Also I expect pizza to be greasy but my slice was so greasy the toppings all slid off and several puddles of grease formed on my plate while I attempted to keep it all together.    

Never again!!"}
{"text":"Quick pizza need fast and cheap.  Ok, not cheap but surprisingly good.  Tangy sauce unexpectedly tasty.  In a pinch a decent meal if you can swallow $7 per slice."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza. My favorite pizza on the strip. It is located in the Flamingo Casino food court."}
{"text":"There are 3 locations of this restaurant.....MGM, Flamingo, and upstairs by Coyote Ugly at New York New York. The one at NYNY is Called NYP. This is my favorite pizza on the strip by far. They usually stop serving pasta at 10pm."}
{"text":"Man i don't know how you can mess up Pizza this bad.  But everything from the sauce to the cheese and crust is pretty awful. One grade above bowling alley pizza but $6 a slice."}
{"text":"The pizza was good.  However the Caesar was wilted.   Also the tables and floor was dirty.  We ate there and for 30 minutes the people working talked and walked around but did not clean.  Maybe because it was late.  1 hour before closing.  But the pizza is not that incredible to ignore the dirt."}
{"text":"I want to rate this place higher but the customer service and experience brought it down. I guess the staff had their entire family inside to eat and the they had about 4 young kids running around inside. It's already small inside and these kids are running around. The kids were bumping into the customers who were seated. And the parents of the kids were talking to the employees behind the counter and they kept ruining my ruin and missing my order. A baby a couple months old was on the counter and one of the employees was the holding the baby and instead of paying attention to the customers he was talking to his family instead. I'm all about family but your at work and your family is causing a ruckus!!! Pizza was good but the service and what I experienced is unacceptable for a restaurant"}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich. $6. Freshly cooked bacon. The rest of it had that soggy under-the-heat-lamp quality to it. Poorly trained server couldn't figure out how to charge it to my room (claimed she couldn't find my room number.)"}
{"text":"First, the employees were SO friendly! They made small talk with me while my pizza slice was heating up in the oven. That's so refreshing!
Now, the food was good - not the best, but it's a good, quick slice of pizza. I got a side salad, as well. It's supposed to be a small ceasar salad, but I can't have ceasar dressing. They were nice enough to give me a side of ranch dressing! (Thank you!) 
So, for a slice of cheese pizza, a side salad, and a regular beverage, it was a little more than $12."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here for a preconcert snack before seeing Cheap Trick and Aerosmith in concert at the venue next door.  They sell a variety of flavors of pizza both by the slice and as a whole pie as well as salads and drinks, even beer.  You can even order pasta and chicken dishes.

Prices for pizza by the slice were as follows: Cheese $4.95, Pepperoni $5.95, and special flavors $6.95.  I ordered a slice of BBQ chicken with red onion and it was huge.  It was delicious and filling, and so was the rather large salad I ordered.

I understand this place is open pretty much 24/7 so it's great for those middle of the night munchy runs that seem to be so common in Vegas."}
{"text":"greasy pizza.  after patting the pizza down the taste wasnt that bad but not worth the money.  their side salad was absolutely DISGUSTING. no taste and soggy.  we were there at like 10 at night and they only had pizza and no pasta.  lame.  i wouldve rather have gone to the mcds next to it or even hot dogs.  eww. pass.  plus they had pizza sitting out.  then im assuming it was cold so they placed it back into the oven.. errr idk how i feel about that i guess it was still good and all but ehhh.. makes me think that it was old. eww"}
{"text":"Bonanno's serves New York style pizza in the food court of MGM.  

Pizza by the slice is usually my selection for something cheap and quick when I am on the run.  This is as cheap and as quick as it may get in Vegas.  

Pizza is about $6 a slice and they focus on specialty slices.  If you add a couple bucks you can get a side salad to go along with your slice of pizza.  A whole pizza is ridiculously expensive but again I don't think anything is cheap around here.  The line was long and the pizza was ok.  It was cheaper then fine dining but by no means a budget cutter."}
{"text":"FOOD POISON. Last night I had two slices of pizza. One vegetarian and one with chicken. I had Vomiting and Diarrhea since that time. I can't go to work. I still feel so week and dehydrated. Be careful what you eat in here. Also I ordered three slices of pizza. She paid for 4 slices and gave me only two."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's just cause I'm hungry when I'm playing games... but this pizza is delicious and the garlic knots are BOMB!!! Our favorite place to grab a late night snack in the Flamingo!"}
{"text":"The pizza is usually very good. For some reason it was not up to the standards they've set. But today the selection was not up to par & my fianc√© was looking forward to their stuffed pizza, and they did not offer it. This is the 3rd or 4th time this has been the case."}
{"text":"4 stars for a food court.  Wandered down for breakfast at 10:30.  Sit down option had a very long line.  The other food court joints had egg sandwiches and the like but the veggie loaded pizzas at Bonanno's caught our eye.  My other half and I shared a spinach tomato basil Stromboli with a Caesar side salad, total bill $12.92 including tax.  The salad had nice flavor and was properly mixed.  The Stromboli was extremely cheesy with a supplement of spinach.  The accompanying little cup of marinara sauce helped cut the grease of the cheese.  The music in the food court was obnoxious to our ears.  I think we hit this place at the right time as they were just putting out the pizzas and such."}
{"text":"I'm just going to come right out and say it! I prefer this pizza over Pieology's. There it is! Up in the air! I like it better!

The pizza here is a great snack when you've been walking around Downtown and need an afternoon bite before your ice cream taco. It's cheesy with a crisp thin crust! Mmmm..."}
{"text":"Not bad. A slice & a soda will set you back about $7.50. Higher than most places, but it is Summerlin. Slices are a little larger than if you go to a pizzeria & order 2 slices. Very small inside dining area."}
{"text":"I was going to bitch about how expensive it is but this is on the strip. Actually at $6.95 for a specialty slice it's not bad. The slices are huge, btw I ordered two. One mushroom and the other who knows looked like a meat lovers type. The two slices filled the med. pizza box. Also I got a large coke @ $3.95 now that's a ripoff.

The pizza's were good the meat one was alot better. Open late night is always a plus. This wasn't my first time and def won't be my last."}
{"text":"Rude and uninformed staff! Flavorless pizza! Yuck!

We decided to order a whole pizza to feed the family. We approached the counter and started to order a whole pizza, the girl had to ask a supervisor if she could take an order for a whole pizza... (It was on the menu)... After we placed our order the cashier had no idea how to ring up a whole pizza. So after all the confusion was over, we were told it would take about 20 min. 

We waited and went back 20 min later. When we approached the counter to pick up the pizza and the cashier just ignored us. We had to almost yell for the supervisor to get us our pizza. 

After dealing with people who just didn't want to be at work, we started to head back to our room where we opened the box to find a stone cold pizza!!! After taking a bite of flavorless pizza, we all agreed it was disgusting. Waste of $30+!!!

Cardboard is the only word I have to describe this pizza."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of pasta but whenever we go to vegas, we always make it to eat their baked zitti. It's really yummy, creamy and a little sweet, also portions are really big. We only order 1 but it fills me and my wife and even our child. Must try when you are in Vegas, they are usually found in most food courts in hotels."}
{"text":"We stopped in here this week on our way out of town thinking it'd be a cheaper option than one of the sit down places here on the Strip.  We were also in the mood to just get something on-the-go and we had eaten in this little food court before so thought we'd give it a whirl. 

We opted for the pepperoni stromboli's.  They looked good and they also stuck them in the oven to heat them up.  Overall tasted okay but a little cheesy for my tastes.  

Our only complaint was the price.  For a small bottle of Aquafina and two smallish stromboli's it was about $24.  Total rip off for what you're getting.  Again, it's on the Strip so that's what you're paying for.  

Overall food was good but just expensive for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Pizza was OK, but hit the spot at 4am after a night of boozin!  Quick service and priced for strip!"}
{"text":"Bonanno's is so clutch! If you're in MGM on a late night and want something tasty you can't lose with them. $5-6 slice with yummy cheeses. Slices are a really nice size."}
{"text":"This review is a little bit late but here it is. I visited Vegas for the holidays and stayed at The Flamingo. Wanted to grab some late night eats before I went to the room for the night so I stopped by here. Not bad at all. The price was inflated but it is Vegas so that does not really count against them. The pizza slice was generously sized and perfectly greasy after a night of cocktails. Keep in mind the pizza sits under heat lamps for who knows how long so it is not going to be amazing. They throw it in the oven when you order it to heat it up. The service was just ok. Nothing special. They have like a mini food court and this place had the best food in my opinion. Looking for something quick and easy this is a good place."}
{"text":"Don't even bother stopping to eat here. I stopped and tried a slice of pizza with mushrooms and a garlic knot. The pizza dough was too thin in the center. The first half of The pizza slice was soggy because of it being so thin. What others are saying about the garlic knots is true. It just tasted like a roll of bread, not much garlic flavor at all. Also, it was busy when I went in. They need a better system of identifying who's food order is up on the counter. They placed my food on the counter and someone else came and grabbed my plate and started drinking my drink. I find this very bothersome, I do not like the general public touching my food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his family were at the outdoor mall doing some day after xmas shopping. We were starving and it was freezing, so we didn't want to walk to the other side of the mall towards more of the restaurant area. We decided to go to Bonanno's NY Pizzeria. We had about 7 of us, and this place was pretty small inside and packed, so we ended up sitting outside under the heated lamps so we could have some space.

The garlic knots were super good! The tomato basil and red onion pizza was pretty flavorful, too! Overall it was a great deal and the staff was friendly. They even recommended us getting a full pizza instead of slices since it would be cheaper, which I thought was nice that they recommended. We ended up just doing the slices since they were already there. 

This place is great for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"The early morning crew at this pizzeria is amazing! They give the best customer service! Yudit is always happy and god to help you! Plus the breakfast food is really good!! I love eating here!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Enjoyed there pizza by the slice special. Good service. Will come here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"We had this the night before we left. I ordered the baked ziti and could not believe the amount that was put on my plate, i kind of asked what was up with that and that it was enough when she added another scoop and said they serve large portions! I had ordered the meatballs and a garlic knot as well before i knew how much food i was getting! The ziti was really good with the marinara sauce on top but way to much for me to eat. I really didnt care for the meatballs (my girlfriend loved hers) and would never ever order them again. I could only take a few bites of the garlic knot but thought they were great. All in all it was a good food court bang for your buck especially if you are sharing otherwise it seemed like a waste of food unless you got a to go container and would finish it off later!"}
{"text":"Over priced service is terrible. After 9 PM they don't have baked Zeti or side salads and alot of other things other than Pizza. Somehow they expect you to know this even though there are no signs stating this. The Pizza was bland"}
{"text":"They have  great stromboli here. The pizza is good but the stromboli is better. Every time I come to Vegas I eat here as often as i can and take a couple home. Always use the coupon and get second one 50 percent off."}
{"text":"Here you are in Vegas, where you find several overpriced mediocre restaurants in which you can easily shell out one hundred dollars on a single meal, and a place that serves a six dollars pizza slice within walking distance from your hotel room gets a 3 stars rating on yelp. Come on, people.

Located at the MGM food court, this is the perfect place to have a quick bite without spending too much money. Yes,  those slices probably sit there for several days and are full of carcinogenic substances, but they cost only six bucks. They don't taste so bad either. My favorite being the Hawaian Pizza (pineapple and ham go great together, believe it or not). I've been here on a number of occasions and never had to wait more than 5 minutes for my pizza and never had any issues with the staff. I mean, this is no Disney World¬Æ customer experience, but these guys get the job done."}
{"text":"Buzzzed and super hungry at 4am, this was the perfect place to get some grub!!!  Got 3 huge slices of pepperoni & bacon!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a slice of the pepperoni/pineapple pizza very much! The food area was little dirty with some empty trays that needed to be refilled with food or cleaned."}
{"text":"For a quick snack in Vegas, this place serves it's purpose.  Don't expect over the top service, just the bare minimum to get some food.  The food is as expected for a food court, not ultra great, but doesn't suck either."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent!  Open late into the night which I loved.  Prices are more like airport prices, but it's Vegas.  Except to pay $9 for a slice and a drink.  Good selection of beverages though if you want something other than the free stuff while gambling."}
{"text":"EWWW Line really long looks like all pizza was pre-made and reheated and then reheated again. My pizza was luke warm so I went back to reheat it and it turned into a huge blob of grease. also not cheap each slice is $4.95 and they charge $3.50 for a fountain soda ! I actually did not eat the pizza because it was just way to greasy."}
{"text":"Pros:

Delicious cheese combination
Crust not too hard or soft
They heat slice for each order
Tasty caesars salad with not too much vinegar and scrumptious croutons. Made to order.   (Salad possibly better than pizza.)
Coupons on tray paper liner

Cons:

Expensive $5-$6 a slice for 1/8 large pizza
************
Notes: We never been inside a pyramid before but in December it was cold, drafty and dark. I was trying to figure out where the wind came from. Despite this, we enjoyed the pleasant pyramid pizza."}
{"text":"I am surprised I am even giving this place a two star.  Probably because the workers look like they are really working hard.
I ordered a french toast platter with hash browns.  This place looks like an assembly line.  The food is no better than McDonalds.  Everything is just in a heating container.  When you order something, they scoop it up and throw it on a styrofoam plate.  
I ordered my food and three people after me got their food before I did.  When I did get it, the hash brown was a rectangle and greasy like you get at Micky D's.  French toast was nothing special.  Eggs tasted like they were processed in a vat.

Flamingo is okay, this place is not so much."}
{"text":"After the ACMs I went to grab some food. Ordered a slice and the Stromboli.

The pizza was fine, than I took a bite into the Stromboli. It was completely RAW in the center."}
{"text":"morning after is delicious however day of is only ok... a little pricey though..."}
{"text":"The pizza is not bad for late night pizza, but it's no where near New York Pizza as they label themselves. On top of that, they don't offer fresh garlic or garlic powder, so definitely not New York pizza. Of you are drunk and in the area, definitely good for a pizza fix, but be prepared to drop a LOT of money here."}
{"text":"Pizza and garlic knots are good! Service was terrific. Rick was helping us. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"$6 for nothing special slice of cheese pizza?! $10 for a little stromboli?! Do you think we print money? Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This is perfect night cap grub! If your stumbling out of Hakkasan or find yourself ravenous wandering around the huge MGM grand gambling into the wee hours of the night, keep wandering down to the food court for the most wholesome decision you've made all night. Huge New York style slices with a variety if drool worthy toppings.  I tried the mushroom spinach, one slice is more than enough and with one set you back about $6. Take your huge slice and sit in the food court devouring your pizza and being glad that you let carbs back into your life."}
{"text":"Asked for whole pizza then sit waiting for it. They didn't ring the buzzer for 30minutes. When we asked about the pizza they just said 'we forgot' and started baking one.
Don't worry ordering whole pizza here."}
{"text":"Love eating here for my break however will not go back. They cut their portions now in smaller boxes tooo spent almost 6$ that's w/my discount and I tipped. Not worth the money anymore."}
{"text":"I am not writing a review about the food although it was decent.

A woman named Jackie took care of me every morning and was alway pleasant and greeted everyone, (even the drunks), with a kind smile.

Unfortunately a rarity today but proof that it is the little things that matter and the food takes a back seat to great service."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and vibes. Definitely my new favorite pizza joint!!  Can't wait for the happy hour and restaurant to open up."}
{"text":"Great spot in the MGM Grand.  We had the stromboli and chicken parm with baked ziti.  Tasted great, while a little heavy on the sauce, the portions were large.  If you're hungry for Italian and don't want to wait, this is a good place to stop."}
{"text":"Food seemed like it was left out for a long while.  For the price my friend and I paid, we deserved a fresh one!  Lame that they brought both our food out at the same time although we ordered at different times.  There were coupon deals for the whole food court on the tray.  Gayness.  My other friend received the deal late too.  Had we known, we would've saved a little.  Oh well.  At least I'm tipping you off for the future!

You're welcome lol"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, the girl (cashier) was super snotty. 3 slices and 2 waters 17 bucks a bit steep- but the slices were filling,  but fresh, not greasy -a nice place to.people watch"}
{"text":"This place was alright. The portion size was pretty good. There wasn't that much cheese on the pizza. The crust was pretty decent. Something to get fast when you are drunk."}
{"text":"Delicious stuffed pizza and stromboli in a quick service establishment. Great service and friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"BEST pizza in town!  I'm from NJ and it's just like back home. I've lived in Las Vegas for 22 years and it took that long for someone to realize that, for those of us that moved here from the East Coast, miss our pizza. Thank you."}
{"text":"The pizza's sauce has a nice taste.  However, pizza in this state is tough. Hard water and dough is just not a good match. The staff inside the pizza area I have found always friendly and with smiles on their faces.
Now, the restaurant side.  I've been 4 times, first time was when they first opened.  I will skip that tale.  Then I tried it again 6 months later.  A friend and myself were seated at the bar.  The bar had about four other people and this female bartender we had was awful.  She was busy chatting and helping the two men on our opposite corner.  We would've been better off serving ourselves.  We asked for every little thing, I mean everything- utensils, water a drink and yes. Even menus. She had no regard or knowledge of the menu, let alone manners. What she did have was an attitude.  My thoughts with any business is this: she was hired by them, hence that speaks volumes of the establishment.  It is a reflection on the business.  I was in Downtown Summerlin last night with the same friend and we dined elsewhere.  As we walked by as I snapped the picture we recalled that lack of a personality bartender. Never again."}
{"text":"Pretty average pizza, probably worth a two or three star review. The problem... we ordered several varieties and the clerk immediately reached for the oldest, nastiest, most burnt piece available of each variety, all the while pretending not to hear or notice us specifying which slice we wanted."}
{"text":"Listen to me.  Are you listening? Good.  I'm originally from New York. I have scoured the Southwest looking for that New York style slice that is so difficult to replicate outside of the tri state area.  Some say it can't be replicated because of the water there.  This is, by far, the most authentic New York style pizza I've ever eaten outside of NY! I don't know how they're doing it. Just the right amount of grease, gooey cheese and a crisp, thin,  bendable crust. Our search for good pizza in Vegas is over and we've been looking ever since we moved here 2 years ago!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is in the food court of the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas.  It's similar to sbarro's, but has more varieties of pizza toppings.  The chicken & veggie and mushroom pizza is very good!  There's also some pasta, salad, and garlic bread."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is located in the food court at Luxor Hotel and Casino. My husband and I were looking for a place it eat before our show. I was craving pizza and decided to try this place out. 

We went here on a Thursday early evening and it was not busy at all. I was looking at the pizzas and the worker didn't bother asking me if I was ready. I was interested in the stuffed meat lovers pizza. I asked him how much it was for a slice and he replied \"the same as the other pizzas\" and he said it with attitude! 

The worker put the pizza in the oven to warm it up. I ate the pizza and it was not warm. It tasted ok. My husband and I didn't even finish the one slice. 

Customer service was poor. I mean, for it being slow, he could have been nicer. Food was not great.  We wish we went to McDonalds instead. We never get disappointed there!"}
{"text":"Nothing amazing but it's a perfectly okay slice of pizza and they're open late so you can get a slice after seeing a late show. It can be greasy but blotting with a few napkins takes care of that (my wife is from NY and claims that's sacrilege)."}
{"text":"I had the Stromboli which is kind of a baked sandwich made of a dough similar to pretzels. Amazing sandwich. The pretzel-like dough was nothing I had had before. 

Also had a slice of mushroom pizza. When I first bit into it, a small explosion of flavor filled my mouth and was unexpectedly amazing. A normal, unassuming slice of pizza did not look like it would contain so much flavor. It was really greasy but a few napkin soaks and it was all good. 

Would highly recommend this place and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is okay. The pizza is okay, not great, but not sucky either. Pricey though, but what do you expect when you're in Vegas. The only upside I can think of coming here is after a night of clubbing since it's open 24/7 I believe. Overall, I have had better pizza but it's convenient eating here especially if you are looking for some quick food."}
{"text":"The pizza here is realllly good. However, it is expensive! Vegas prices I tell ya! Its about $30 for a regular cheese or pepperoni pie. Also, like $8-10/per slice. You do the math! Expensive.

However, the pizza is really good--especially the 4-cheese. We came back to buy 2 whole pies the next night after we tried it out. They said it'd take 30 mins but the pies came out within 10.

 Its a decent late-night stop if you're in the MGM."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, I like the NY style you just can't beat it. They have many topping choices and you can order a whole pizza or by the slice. They also have side salads, some pasta choices and garlic knots (my fav). Its a little greasy but I like my pizza that way, especially if you had a long night before. They warm up your slices before giving it you so that's a huge plus. This place is a favorite to go for when I'm on my lunch break."}
{"text":"I love this place and would love for them to open up a location closer to me. I'm out toward Boulder City so, if you can put one in at The District in Henderson, that would be great. In the meantime I will make the drive way across town to get my pizza. Keep up the good work and don't change any of your recipes."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap bite to eat while at the MGM Grand, this may be the least expensive choice.  A slice of pepperoni will cost you only $6, which is a bargain for this area.  The food tastes OK, and the service is pretty quick.  Sure, you can find better pizza in Vegas, but you won't find anything quicker or cheaper."}
{"text":"Decent Pizza and pasta. My go to spot for a quick snack to hold for dinner. The side of meatballs are quite tasty too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before my hair appointment because the smell wafting down the sidewalk was too tempting to resist! It is VERY small inside and with only one girl working the counter it felt cramped near the front. We ordered cheese pizza. It came out fresh. A little too much sauce for me, but the cheese was so hot the grease instantly pooled! Sign of freshness! Will be bringing hubby back to try a Stromboli for sure!"}
{"text":"Want comfort food and greasy pizza well stop here. Pizza was okay, but I have had way better regardless if it was new york or los angeles pizza.

Ordered two large slices, meat lovers and pepperoni. Each slice was about $6.50 plus a small drink was $3

$18 dollars after I was enjoying decent pizza and a drink before attending fights at the MGM Grand.

Well I come back again I doubt it."}
{"text":"BBQ Chicken, best pizza I have had in Vegas, not too many places can make Pizza. Get a slice of the BBQ Chicken, you will love it, it does have a little bacon on it so if your not a bacon fan do not get it. Bu this was GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD Pizza"}
{"text":"If you're just a tad bit hungry and looking for a simple salad. Elizabeth took care of me and honestly made me a nice tasty Caesar salad. She was careless about it she gave me an equal taste to everything. I'm couldn't stop thanking her because she was so generous and she had a positive attitude when I asked her for a little bit more cheese. She's great if you want your salad tossed right. Thanks Elizabeth !"}
{"text":"I don't remember how I got here, but my slice of cheese pizza at 4 in the morning hit the spot.  No, it wasn't artisan pizza.  But I wanted a greasy slice to fill me up, and I got what I paid for.  And $5 and some change?  Not bad at all.  A way better alternative to the McDonald's next door."}
{"text":"Great flavor on the chicken bbq, it needs more chicken on it though, but was a great slice!  The garlic knots need more garlic, they are butter soaked but just tastes like bread with a little butter flavor over all great experience less then $10 for a meal for 1 person. I will be back!"}
{"text":"water: $3.25
actual price: $5.98

nice bait and switch. way to scam every customer out of a couple bucks because most people don't look at their receipt."}
{"text":"The kids and I passed by and couldn't help but notice how amazing it smelled. Had to stop in and grab the kids and I a few slices. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Hungry after walking around the area, and stopped by here for a bite. The review is only for the pizza: I didn't get to try the gelato. The selection was decent; there were a lot of different ready-to-reheat pizza options out, which was nice. I ended up trying their Pepperoni Pizza, White Pizza, and
Caesar Salad. Honestly, the only thing I liked was the Caesar Salad, and that was probably because it was hand-tossed, made-to-order, and drenched in dressing. 

Both pizza slices were remarkably bland in flavor, and surprisingly dry, while greasy at the same time, if that makes sense. I think that talks to the balance of cheeses/meats and sauces on the pizzas, but it didn't work for me. It was satiating and edible, but wasn't anything extraordinary, nor would I necessarily choose to return to eat there of my own volition (for the pizza). A friend seemed to enjoy the gelato, so perhaps I'll give them a try down the road and reevaluate, but for now, I'll pass."}
{"text":"This is evidently the Vegas version of Sbarro's, located in pretty much all of the food courts (which the hotels have evidently lifted wholesale from the malls) of the various hotels. This particular one is in Mandalay Bay, more or less by the Shark Reef thing. I have no reason to suspect any of the others are more different, though perhaps the food court area at some of the other ones is less crowded. I've never seen the one at Mandalay Bay at anything less than full capacity, ever, even across multiple visits.

Instead of a thicker slice, ala Sbarro's, what we have here is sort of an attempt at New York style pizza. We can and will throw authenticity out of the nearest window, since they're not in the right realm, unless you're measuring strictly on foldability, which the slice I had did fine with. If you want anything more than that (and you will, especially if you're from New York), you'll still be wanting after you finish wiping the grease off your hands and maybe your mouth. This is a very average pizza, but because it's in a hotel, it's also very pricey, matching that of stadiums and/or airports."}
{"text":"Great pizza at an awesome spot. The owners served us outside and were super friendly.  I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This is a small outlet in Flamingo's food court that I ate at during my last stay in the Flamingoes. My first attempt was baked ziti (basically penne), meatballs and a garlic knot combo. The pasta was raw, meatballs needed a hammer and chisel and the garlic knot was doughy. As I could not get myself to eat this crap I got a slice of pizza which was Not Good but I managed to get something down. As expected prices are inflated with just the slice of pizza running around $7. Totally avoidable. Take the pain of walking to the myriad of options on the strip is my take away from this experience."}
{"text":"Never had anything but pizza here, but it is very good. 

We have had pizza all over this town and this is my go back to pizza.  It's never soggy or greasy. 

I'm really surprised to see some Bad reviews. 
I guess it's a pizza thing, because I've tried some other pizza places around that had super great reviews and the pizza at those places are gross."}
{"text":"Wow, I am floored by all of the bad reviews....I've never had anything but fast, friendly service and tasty pizza here.

Bonanno's is very similar to Sbarro - the pizza is pre-made, then sent through the oven again when you order a slice.  You can also order whole pies, which are made fresh (takes a bit longer).

They also have salads and pastas, which have always been good when I've tried them.  They have a pretty decent selection of pizzas/toppings.

The prices are pretty high, but that's to be expected at a Strip Hotel.  They are open pretty late, which is great for after concerts/shows or a night of drinking."}
{"text":"The (breakfast) FOOD: Typical food court offerings and quality. It's not horrible, but nothing special. A decent option for breakfast, especially since it's the only choice on this side of the resort other than Subway.

The SERVICE: The cashier was helpful and had a cheerful demeanor. The server was horrible! She displayed the stereotypical \"I don't give a \"@&%#\"\" attitude. She was rude and not invested in her customers. 

I get it. It's early and you probably believe you're better than just slinging breakfast sandwiches all morning but don't lay your \"land of broken dreams\" act on your customers. I expect more at a high-end resort. 7/13/15 am"}
{"text":"Do not bother. I understand if they are open later than most restaurants and/or pizzerias on the strip but that does not justify the 18.00 dollar price tag on two sub-par slices.
Actually, the slices are not even as good as many dollar slice spots I know of in NYC!
Stay away! I am only giving the 2nd star for convenience ( and they do not even stay open all-night...if we arrived 5 minutes later they would get 0 stars)."}
{"text":"This place serves big slices of pizza. Came here after a terrible dining experience elsewhere. They have a good combo, a slice and a drink for about $8, i think. They have available seating with a great view including outside seating near the pool. The spot is located within the flamingo casino, fast and easy. The pizza are tasty, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Had Bonanno's over the Summer while I was in Vegas. Its located in the Food Court at the MGM Grand. 
Decent Pizza. Kind of like Sbarro's. I liked it. Nothing crazy spectacular, but its good. 
Definitely a better alternative to one of the fast food joints in there. 
Would eat again."}
{"text":"I don't write many 1 star reviews but this place was a big disappointment. I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a pizza place in the mall. This place really just seems like an sbarro that was rebranded. Flavorless sauce and $5 bucks a slice better to not waste your time. They should be ashamed to use a name like Bonnano and have such bland pizza."}
{"text":"These guys were about to close and I asked for a half cheese half pepperoni pizza and they obliged. The pizza was delicious. It was obviously hot right out of the oven. We just left the hockey game at T-Mobile arena so we were in need of something good. Thanks Bonanno's for taking care of us. Pizza was $38 little pricey but we are in Vegas right now.."}
{"text":"3-13 was yet another day of stopping in to get my pizza fix. I always come here around the same time and I get my Stuffed pizza fix. The last 4 times I have come they are out. They don't even have at least a thick crust pizza option for those of us that like it. I still grabbed a Hawaiian slice. Little did I see some of the peppers from the supreme set above my Hawaiian had fallen on my pizza. I hate peppers. At least I'm not allergic. 
The young man at the register was a delight. He even asked the chefs why they never have the stiff d pizza anymore. Their response was something left to be desired. They said they only make it once a day in the am because it takes so much to do. Lame answer for a lazy chef if you ask me. Then make two so it lasts. If you're constantly selling out...... then make more  but whatever. I have like I said come 4 times now for the best stuffed pizza ever, but I have no reason to come back. If it's always gonna be gone because it's too much work then what's the point"}
{"text":"For anyone who know's \"Sbarro's\", Bonanno's New York Pizzeria is basically a cheap imitation meant to feed drunk and/or down on their luck Lost Wages visitors passing through the Flamingo. Similar large slices, thin and deep crust pizza, IMO overpriced and under-seasoned. While I can't judge their other offerings, it was obvious amongst co-diners that the 'za was nothing more than a late night fix for folks cutting through or returning to their hotel after an after hours bar crawl. The pizza sits on warmers waiting to be thrown in an oven and re-heated. End result is a bland, watery attempt at New York thin crust for $7.00. Don't waste your time, unless it's meant to fight of a rough migraine in the morning."}
{"text":"Located inside the food court at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, Bonanno's offers some delectable food selections. Pizza is good as well as baked ziti but really enjoyed the Caesar salad with shaved parmesan cheese. Lettuce was crispy, fresh and chilled. Prices are very competitive for Las Vegas strip eateries. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is open really late (until 4am if I recall) and when I'm making my way back to my room at The Signature, I thought why not pick up a pizza on the way back.  The pizza was quite good, it was ready very quickly and given the early hour in the AM, the staff was quite friendly.

See you the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I needed to hit the food court before a concert and so pizza it was!
I had a slice of the Hawaiian and a slice of the Meat Lover's Delight. The Hawaiian was good but the Meat Lover's was better as it had bacon!!! Definitely pricey at about $6 a slice, and the slices were on the larger side. 
This is standard food court stuff, so I wasn't that impressed. I wanted to order a stuffed slice, which is on the menu. I asked about it and was told they don't have any stuffed slices. 
If you want an overpriced beer, they have that too. 
The restaurant is located in the food court, which is deep in the bowels of the convention center and also near the Shark Reef. 
It's easily missed. Signage for the food court doesn't exist until you're already almost in the convention center. 
It's almost like a secret food court."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was the booze or the fact that we were starving, but i thought the food was great.  It was cheap, the slice was huge and the service was great.  I agree with other reviewers, it is not the best pizza in Vegas but it serves its purpose beautifully.  Yup, i'm a fan."}
{"text":"I don't know if the slice I had today was sitting out all day or what... It tasted like mush in the front and the crust at the edge was so hard I could have thrown it at the chef and taken his eye out. Absolutely the worst pizza I've had out here, a waste of $5. DOMINO'S pizza is better.... and that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Would I rather pay too much for mediocre hot dogs or mediocre pizza? Count this as another winning data point for mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"Way too much for what you get. Especially when there's another one (much cheaper!)on the strip. Service was okay, nothing special. The food was good, just not worth what they ask at this location."}
{"text":"Came here 3/4 nights that I was in Vegas for Halloween weekend. It's the best thing when you're drunk at three in the morning!

I got cheese pizza one day and pepperoni the others. Straight out of the oven it's delicious, but also as good the next day! Their garlic knot things are okay, not too much garlic flavor. I guess something to soak up the booze. 

It's located in the food court the bottom of the MGM Grand Hotel. It's the only thing open there at that hour bedsides McDonald's. Super friendly staff even when dealing with drunkies. I'll definitely be back whenever I stay here."}
{"text":"Wanted to get some garlic knots, which they had plenty left, but was told they were closed. Alright, great, if you want to waste food and turn away business, I'm cool with that."}
