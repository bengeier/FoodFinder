{"text":"Awesome food and the gentleman that takes your orders is awesome as well. Put a smile on my face that's for sure"}
{"text":"Dumb little kid has no respect for customers. Really need to fix service to get more customers."}
{"text":"I just love this hot dog place.   Its small and family run.  There are pick nick tables outside to sit at and a TV playing Telmundo at all times.     For me, the only thing I have had on the menu is their signature Sonoran style dog.  Great fresh bread not regular store bought buns but good ones from a local bakery - with a bacon wrapped dog smothered in refried beans, guac, sour cream, mustard, cream, cheese, fresh tomatoes and amazing caramelized onions.  This place is awesome.  Anytime I am in the area, I try to stop by.  They are mostly open in the evening.     I gave it 5 stars because the dog is amazing and they used quality ingredients cooked just right."}
{"text":"Their food is really good my husband and I love this place. It would always satisfy my cravings when I was pregnant and still does"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. My hotdogs were basically raw as well as the bacon. The carne asada isn't even chopped and to top it of the clearly have not understanding of customer service. Never again will I eat from dump again!!!"}
{"text":"Good tacos but last time they switch from cilantro and onions to cabbage. Please switch it back like how it used to be. the kid taking orders is funny not sure why people take him personal. We always talk and he asks the funniest questions, normally what any other kid would ask. Just order what you want and pay, no need to be dramatic.  Taco price is decent but they need to stop raising."}
{"text":"My favorite taco truck around the area. Cheap quesadillas and tacos! Never disappointed. I have not tried the hot dogs. I can only speak on the chicken!"}
{"text":"Bomb food but the guy taking the orders is kinda rude. Would have gave it 5 stars but you know I don't like to be treated like I'm a inconvenience when I'm going to eat at your restaurant and there is literally Noone there."}
{"text":"I went last minute cause I was hungry. And I love their hot dogs. Minus the cheese, mayo, and mustard. But $6.99 for a quesadilla?? That's high. They don't have prices on their food which makes me think they change them depending on how they're doing on that day with business. I got two hot dogs and a coke. I paid $9.50. The hot dogs were $3 and I got two. And the coke bottle has to be $3.50. Really? That's insane; might as well stop at Circle K or QT for a fountain drink. The guy taking the order needs to speak up."}
{"text":"Hot dogs were pretty good, but.... Customer service sucks!! The boy/guy taking the order is rude and doesn't acknowledged you!"}
{"text":"This is thee best Mexican food I've had since moving to Arizona. The young man who takes orders is always entertaining. I would suggest this place to anyone who doesn't want the mainstream Mexican food such as Filibertos. It's wayyyyy better than Filibertos! I would suggest the carne asada fries and the tacos, which are super cheap and extremely worth it."}
{"text":"Can't relate to Arturo A! The kid was soo nice to me and had exceptional customer service. Straight flamas"}
{"text":"16.50? For a Sonora dog, fries and a steak burrito with large watered down Hibiscus tea at a food truck.. What a joke.. Meat in the burrito is over cooked and the fries undercooked. The hot dog was decent. The kid taking the orders was not friendly and not helpful.   caro , decía comida y antipático , tomador de pedidos inútil . 16.50 para un perro caliente con patatas fritas y una bebida grande de un burrito de carne ."}
{"text":"Menudo on Sunday"}
{"text":"bad service from the younger kid taking orders. food was good. service sucks! It is located on 67th and lower buckeye corner. Outside seating.. it's basically a food truck."}
