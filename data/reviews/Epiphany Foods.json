{"text":"Epiphany is awesome! I love how friendly the staff are and I love how they have complimentary soup of your choice before you receive your meal. I have not been back in a long time but according to instagram they have a new location (143 Millwick Dr. Toronto, ON M9L 1Y7). The food is always fantastic and comes very quickly. It's great for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice and it's been a great experience.  Extremely friends staff, excellent wings, jerk chicken, and FESTIVAL!!  I never really knew what festival was and i became a fan after trying it out for the first time here.  Very well priced and I will go back regularly as I work very close to it.  I recommend anyone who's loves to try good, authentic Caribbean food in this neighbourhood to try Epiphany."}
{"text":"Hidden away on Millwick Drive,  Epiphany is really a wonderful little find for Jamaican food. From Soup, Escovitch Fish, Jerk Chicken or Festival; it's all authentic and very tasty!

The owner and staff are so friendly and kind and nothing seems too much trouble.

On Sat. night they have music and it feels just like you're back \"a yard\".
Worth the drive to Etobicoke...but also has catering and take out.
Best Jamaican food I've found in Toronto!"}
