{"text":"When we arrived at this restaurant at 4:30 on a Wednesday afternoon we were greeted by Jennifer a transplant from New Yawk!!!! Jennifer was our introduction to an evening of delicious food along with her great service. She treated us like we had arrived into her own dining room! The way she described each dish had our mouths watering! The 6 of us chose different dishes along with 4 appetizers and we all shared a cannoli. We were told to stay at the table as long as we wanted. She was gracious and kind and even shook our hands and hugged us as we left! If we lived in Scottsdale we would come here often! You should too!"}
{"text":"Don't let location prevent you coming from this neighborhood Italian restaurant. Great happy hour, wine menu, and meals. Had soft shell crab special. Delicious. Service was amazing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"La Cucina is a hidden treasure:  My girlfriend and I decided to try it on a whim, and were served outstanding, rustic Italian dishes (including perfectly-prepared softshell crab) by a knowledgeable, attentive wait staff.  We barely managed to save enough room for dessert, which included an excellent, made-on-premises tiramisu.  The server's wine recommendations were also spot-on.   I can't say enough about the quality of the food and the cozy atmosphere.  Dollar-for-dollar, this is one of the best Italian restaurants in the entire Scottsdale/Phoenix metroplex, despite the humble location next to a supermarket and a nail salon.  Highest marks!!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best restaurants I have ever been to! I loved everything that my party ordered, the bread came out warm and fresh, and the chicken Parmesan was the absolute best I have ever had. I loved the small little hometown feel, the employees were all very nice and took good care of our party. The owner came out and was talking and visiting with some of the customers and he stopped by our table and had a nice little conversation with our table as well. It was a great meal, great atmosphere, and did I say great food! It was good lol"}
{"text":"Super cozy wonderful neighborhood gem. Stopped in tonight to check it out. The bartender, Jennifer I think, couldn't have made you feel more welcome. Tried the happy hour chianti ($5) which was good but for $3 more the Pinot Noir was outstanding. She recommended the eggplant torte ($5 on happy hour) and the portion was generous and delicious. Definitely plan to be back!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but had to for this one. It is the best hidden gem! If you love delicious Italian food, this is your place! Beyond amazing food, staff, and ambiance. It's our new favorite place and feels so homie!! Everyone go!"}
{"text":"We have gone here a number of times loved it each time,I've recommend to a lot of clients, and they all loved it family run place,George the chef and owner great . will be going for mothers day"}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. Decent wine list. Pricing isn't too bad, probably in line with North Scottsdale.  The only negative is that it's really loud inside.  Loud enough to make it hard to hear the person you're with otherwise it would be a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"We love this neighborhood place. Very family oriented. George, the owner, is great and very personable. Jennifer and Anna Marie make the place run smoothly. This part of north Scottsdale needs a place like this!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and the staff was very helpful! A great selection of wine and lots of specials to choose from as well. Not at all what you'd expect from a place located in a strip mall. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A delightful place with a friendly owner. The cannoli and the spaghetti and meatballs were amazing. The \"seafood pasta\" was well worth it. Will be back. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood go-to restaurant.  The food is excellent, the staff super friendly,  and always feel at home.  Favorites are softshell crabs on bed of linguini.  Delicious.  The rack of lamb, the osso bucco, and all of the seafood dishes are super.  Haven't had a single bad dish here, met lots of people who are now friends.  Way above any expectations.  Give it a try.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"It took me a few days to get this review up but as a former waitress I felt it necessary to write about our experience here. First. I will say that the food was good, the service was great, but the distractions were endless. The restaurant was not too busy and the waitress was very friendly, but the noise was so disturbing. There was constant pounding in the kitchen that is only separated by a thin curtain, and the only thing we could hear over the pounding was some man (Im pretty sure was  the owner ) yelling at everyone in the kitchen, at one point it looked like the waitress coming from behind the curtain was going to cry. He would come out and even stopped by to greet us with a polite Hi which I thought was nice, but it was oblivious it was a fake smile cause he turned around and berated the waitresses, in the middle of the restaurant with no regard to the customers (yes we can hear you yelling at your crew). Honestly, It was embarrassing, and I'm sure the servers felt completely belittled. I used to be a server so I pay attention to the little things, I felt horrible for the ladies working and if you need to give your crew a correction, do it privately. It was apparent this guy was either angry all the time or he had a horrible staff, based on my experience with the waitresses I don't think that the staff is the problem, However, It killed the experience cause I was so busy looking at who he was yelling at, it is such a small place it's impossible to just ignore all that noise."}
{"text":"We stopped by for Happy Hour. The service was as amazing as the food on the HH menu, especially the bruschetta board. And the bread...WOW."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the staff Is what makes the experience. The problem is the owner!!! He is basically just not a very nice person. The way he treats his staff is demeaning, degrading and with absolutely zero respect. Doesn't matter if he is the owner. No one has the right to treat other people that way particularly in front of other people/customers (frequently done). Shows lack of character & business acumen. Do yourself a favor and avoid this drama ladend atmosphere. Doesn't make for a pleasant dining experience and the food really isn't that good.  Would have given a 0 if was an option."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with I grew up in a 2nd generation italian-american? household, so my grandmother made this kind of stuff and that's  hard to beat. The service was incredibly friendly and informed...the wait staff knows their menu and wine list and it shows. The entrees definitely demonstrated that someone in the kitchen cares but just didn't live up to the reviews. It was pretty good; not great and for the price I would definitely seek out something with hopes of a better outcome."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but a $9 bottle of wine costs $48, and i had spaghetti and meatballs .. meatballs were very bland, i didnt have hardly any spaghetti, more sauce then anything.  Bread is fabulous."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood Italian restaurant! Excellent food and service! The warm, homemade bread with olive oil, balsalmic vinegar, and rosemary for dipping, is a delicious addition to the flavorful meals."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food. Service was fantastic! Jennifer went above and beyond to take care of us. The frutte di Mare was the best I've had and the calimari was delicious. I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Our second time at La Cucina. The first time the service was fabulous. Meal was superb. Last night we returned expecting more of the same. The waitress was non plus. Just handed us the menu. Nothing about Happy Hour Specials or Specials of the Day. No wine list was given. We ordered an appetizer that we had had before. Eggplant Torte which came quickly and as before was very good. My husband ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs thinking it would be wonderful. I ordered the Chicken Marsala. Both were extremely disappointing. My chicken was tough and the sauce was awful. I had to ask the waitress several times to clear away the dirty dishes.The best part of the meal was the desert.  I could have cooked a better meal at home. Will not return to La Cucina."}
{"text":"The food was authentic and tasty! Their wine list was on spot. We got a Pinot noir and a cab. Both were amazing. The portions are big enough to share or take half home. Bonus for lunch the next day. Love that it is a neighborhood cozy spot where everyone knew everyone AND they spoke Italian. Felt just like Italy."}
{"text":"Just say yes. The food is delicious and authentic and everything is made there and fresh every day, (including the bread). This is an amazing place to go if you're looking for authentic Italian food and a relaxed local feel. I love it!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here and meeting the Owner personally. I really like the home feel and warmth that this new amazing Italian spot brings to the neighborhood.   I had the Chicken Parmesan and it was delicious! One of the best I've ever had. Highly recommended.   I'd give 5 stars but they are new and short staffed. They had the bartender also running food so she was overwhelmed. She was very nice and personal.   I definitely plan on coming again and would recommend others as well!"}
{"text":"The best Caesar salad and fettuccine Alfredo I've ever had. Even compared to New York City, or Italy! Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"La Cucina is the best Italian restaurant in Arizona hands down. Moving here from New York a few years back and trying to find good quality, fresh, and authentic Italian food was very hard until I tried La Cucina. I've been to this restaurant at least once a month and everytime it is outstanding. From the food to the service it's the best. They use high quality products like their fish and meats. This past week, I was at this restaurant I ordered their spaghetti with Red clam sauce and it was to die for. The spice and the homemade calm sauce, my mouth is still watering. They have an amazing happy hour as well 5 dollar appetizers, the escargot is the delicious. If you are a person who likes Italian food, you have to try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"A real mix on review. We made a reservation earlier in the week. When we arrived on Friday evening we were informed they only take reservations for 6 or more. We called for our reservation and this was never mentioned.  We were greeted by who we assume was the owner, dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt. This was the person who informed us of their reservation rules. Well, we did get a table in the back by kitchen. Hmmm. The prices are reasonable and my chicken was good, but my spouse ordered the Marsala and he said he would not order again. As in other previous reviews the owner does yell at staff and it doesn't make for a pleasant atmosphere. Truthfully, I think this was our first and last visit."}
{"text":"Great bread, good food and wine at right price. I'll come back. The service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood Italian restaurant.  Everything was delicious and the service was great!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, and the service is exceptional. The waitress went the extra mile to make it feel as if we had been going to this restaurant for years. They treated us with the utmost respect, and made it a comfortable experience. I enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan, and took some home for leftovers. Location and size to this place is a bit of a surprise since it would fit the description of \"hole in the wall\". This goes to show that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Looking for a small friendly Italian restaurant that is really legit? Well you found it! You got to check this place out it is very good with awesome lunch and happy hour  specials. Oh and did I say they have bread pudding. Well they have some of the best."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was good as well. We went there with friends and ordered a variety of food. We made it there early enough to get the early bird summer dinner specials which was a good deal. It came with a salad entrée and dessert for 16.95.And as I mentioned the service was good. I've been there before and I will go back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, impeccable service and the food and wine were fantastic.  What more could you ask for?    We went on a Sunday evening and sat on the patio.  We ordered glasses of wine and when the waitress returned she explained that there was a special that included two entrees, two salads and a bottle of wine.  She comped us for the glasses we ordered initially, which was very nice.  We ordered the linguine in white clam sauce and the pappardelle bolognese, both of which were fantastic.  The bottle of pinot noir we split was perfect.  We are thrilled to find this little gem in our neighborhood.    We will definitely look to take friends and visitors from out of town here!"}
{"text":"Our favorite French chef has opened an Italian restaurant. Good times and good food in Scottsdale are back!  Yummy - the flounder special."}
{"text":"Sooo, we came back after several months and it was a disaster.   We were seated inside, where it was hotter than Hades; outside it was a mild 73 degrees. But the kitchen heat was killing us, it must have been nearly 90+ inside.   We waited and waited and waited and no one came by to greet us or take our drink order.  Around us, the owner was busing tables and things seemed disorganized.   After ten+ minutes, we threw in our napkins and left.   I couldn't get over how much everything went down hill from our previous visit.  As we left, George the owner asked us why we were leaving. My wife told him and he just shrugged.    I'm sorry. If you like extremely slow service and non-existence AC (what's that all about?) then this is your place.   One Star, down from Four Stars. We had no problem finding a seat at Nick's just down the street and would also recommend Basil & Garlic."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! The food is amazing and the owner and staff are very friendly. My first impression was great! I'll be back, and if the effort continues I will become a regular!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant with great food. Service by Maribel was great :) my dad said it was the best chicken Parmesan he has ever had. The creme brûlée was amazing! I got the lobster ravioli."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend who had been here previously and has been asking me to make the trek from Arcadia. I'll say this place is worth the drive for sure.  We came in around 8:15, the place was about a quarter full and it's really not a big spot. You can tell though they take pride in the limited space that they have and they have a cute little patio.  My friend really wanted mussels, that's why we came so far. She ordered the mussels with the white wine sauce (which was a really delicious sauce). I ordered the lobster ravioli with pink vodka cream sauce and a side Caesar. The Caesar was delicious, but also really big. The ravioli was out of control and the vodka cream sauce had a nice spice to it, it's one of the best I've ever had.  All in all this spot is now on my list of favorite Italian places in Phoenix metro. I will definitely be returning to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place, such a gem!  I have been by it so often when getting my eyelashes done and always wanted to stop in.  Finally, my boyfriend and I stopped in and I wish I would have done it sooner.  It was SO GOOD!  I even convinced my family to drive out from Chandler and they were raving about how good it was.  Right now, I am trying to get my boyfriends butt moving faster so I can fulfill my Italian craving lol.  I will be a regular!    Who am I?  I am a total foodie, who has had the privilege to travel the world and eat at small gems!  I have had the luxury of eating at stalls in hawker centers in Singapore to Three Star Michelin restaurants, like Guy Savoy in Paris.  I have also been all around Italy and ate at the non-tourist gems.  This reminded me of being back in Italy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in town. We had their eggplant torte; this delicious pastry with eggplants zucchini  Italian sauce and cheese baked - mamamia!!!  The lobster ravioli to dye for and the papadore(?) noodles in meat sauce delicious so light!  My son and I ate it all - great wine and great atmosphere - the owner and Chef George so amazing and welcoming. Olivia and the nicest waitress- just a lovely night !!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Came here after the wife suggested it and I was skeptical.  I'm Italian and the food was GREAT.  Very reasonably priced and a nice little neighborhood joint.  Didn't have to wait at all to get seated, which in Scottsdale in the winter is a huge plus.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Sadly, I cannot give this bistro the rave review I had been hoping. This was my second visit to the restaurant. Both times, my food took over half an hour to arrive and the server seemed to have forgotten about it. The woman next to me came in ten minutes after I ordered, placed an order, drank a glass of wine, chatted with the owner, paid, and left before I ever got my food - an appetizer meatballs and a bowl of soup. I had to inquire about it twice, which is not something I usually do. While the soup is excellent and the reason I gave the place a second try, the haphazard and absent service guarantees I will not be back a third time. During my time waiting for my food, I observed the server arguing in tense tones with the owner over my soup, the owner more interested in socializing than helping a slammed server, and a late server arriving to say, \"So, have you been yelled at yet?\" all in front of me. Finally, there was no apology or offer of anything for the fact my food took over half an hour to arrive. The check was dropped in front of me as soon as he saw I was finished eating with no offer to see if I wanted another glass of wine, dessert, or anything else. I am so sad because a wine bar and bistro is just what we had been hoping to have added to our neighborhood. If they want to succeed, they need to seriously hone their service points and treat all customers like they are important, not just their friends."}
{"text":"Ambiance is quaint, food is delish. I am Vegan, and Jennifer was very accommodating to my specific nutritional needs. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We found this charming little Italian bistro in North Scottsdale adjacent to a Safeway. We decided to stop and have dinner there. It was fabulous. Old fashion Italian food like they do it back east. Everything fresh and delicious. Finally a place that puts bread on the table as soon as you're seated. Service is warm and friendly. We ordered Mussels,Caesar salad,mozzarella, and best Chicken Parm with a side of Pasta.  The Owner was very welcoming. It's our new weekly dinner plan!"}
{"text":"George the owner and Jen the bartender could not have been more pleasant.  We sat at the expansive four seat bar, had some apps and wine and just enjoyed talking to These two.  There is nothing like going into a place where employees and owners alike enjoy the guests as much as doing their job.  Great small place and the bar is perfect size."}
{"text":"I visited La Cucina for the first time last night and it was such a great experience! It was the perfect date night spot, as it was very cute and intimate. From the food to the service everything was truly amazing.   Food items we ordered:          They bring you warm bread with balsamic/vinegar to start. Super fresh and delicious.            Appetizer- Clams and the escargot. Both were seriously AMAZING. The plates were pretty much licked clean that's how good they were.             Entree- spaghetti/meatballs and a cesar salad. We were going to get the lobster ravioli but thought since we had seafood for appetizers that we would go meat route. Should of done both!! The meatballs were really flavorful though and a good size.           Dessert- TIRAMISU. Holy crap this dessert was heaven!!! The best tiramisu I've ever had. You can definitely tell it is made in house!  The staff was wonderful and made the experience great. George, Olivier, and Maribelle were so friendly and provided great service.   I will 100 percent be back again for the delicious food, great wine and the service! Five stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants I've been to in Arizona!   The food is exceptional. If you order the Linguine and Clams, come hungry. The bowl is literally overflowing with clams. I've never seen this many served in a dish anywhere I've ever been. You will not be disappointed. Presentation is immaculate and flavor cannot be described. We also had the Chicken Picatta which was equally fabulous as well. I have a feeling I will be trying every item on this menu though.  From what I could tell, this is a place where you don't ever leave unhappy!  We ordered the special - which includes a bottle of wine, a salad per person, and entree per person. Best deal out there for $65!!   On top of the wonderful food and customer service, the owner, George, sees to it that you have an amazing dinner experience. You WILL be treated like family. If you don't believe this level of personal experience exists in Scottsdale, you just haven't been here yet."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Food was delicious, big wine selection. Service was incredible, Maribel was so attentive and gave us such an amazing welcome. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were reluctant at first cuz of it being squished between HR Block and a nail place BUT don't let this deter you. Our server would have gladly offered up a taste of EACH of their wines but we stopped after 6 tests. Good wine selection. Very very friendly. A mom and pop's place! We will visit again and eat a yummy dinner here!"}
{"text":"Their service is top notch, the food is beyond delicious! Don't let the location fool you, it's small and intimate. Perfect for a last minute date night. My husband and I have been wanting to try this place since they opened. Don't let the minimal negative reviews sway you either, everyone has an off night, but I also know that people can over exaggerate their experiences. Come to this gem, you wont regret it!!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise !! We loved this small mom & pop Italian Bistro. The service & food was wonderful. Honestly , it was the BEST seafood Frutti di Mare I have had in AZ. I was shocked !! This will be one of our favs."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, it's sometimes challenging to find the best hidden gems and I also like to avoid chains.  This restaurant experience was absolutely amazing. We arrived to a quiet evening because of the holiday weekend to two very warm and friendly servers. The ambiance is clean, quiet with lovely music and also offers outdoor seating but due to the heat, we sat inside. The wine list is thorough without being overwhelming and is well priced.   We started with the calamari which was well seasoned, cooked fresh and was great. I ordered the soft shell crab with a spaghetti with a garlic and white wine sauce that was to die for. My friend got the baked scallops with a side of linguini.   The service was impeccable, the food was delicious, and the experience was so enjoyable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mirable our server was excellent, service was attentive and the food was great, will definitely go back again . Liked the Happy Hour for wine too!"}
{"text":"Six of us dined there on a weekday night.  The service was outstanding and we had the pleasure of meeting the owner and a couple of highly engaged staffers.  We had five orders of  Pappardelle Bolognese and one Lobster Ravioli plus a bottle of the Montepulciano Wine - all were outstanding.  the Bolognese was more than enough and the sauce was filled with meat and very tasty.  We also had a Caesar salad and the dressing was wonderful.  The Caprese salad was not as good probably due to this being the wrong season for tasty tomatoes.  the bread melted in your mouth - it was that good!  Service was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu and food and very enjoyable.  All in all, an outstanding meal and evening.  We all highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Welcoming accommodating staff. Nice wine list. Great bread for dipping. Branzino was fresh and well prepared. A real find."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant many times,it's one of our favorites. The staff is so friendly and inviting. The owner George treats everyone like family, he likes to talk with everyone who comes in.  But the food is by far the best Italian around. We've never had a dish we didn't truly enjoy, and the cannoli delicious!  I highly recommend checking out this cute little bistro"}
{"text":"It's ok. It's right next door to my favorite nail shop.  I honestly wouldn't recommend it. Service and staff are very cool. But I'll take a pass"}
{"text":"Wow what a great find the food was fantastic and great service I loved the atmosphere and you could tell they cared about the customers"}
{"text":"We went for dinner tonight and the service and the food was great, Jess our server was the best I recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"It's sweet small little restaurant that is super cozy.  The food is very good. The wine list is amazing. I love the staff."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Wonderful service. We came here for my wife's birthday and we were not disappointed. Chicken Parmesan, chicken Marsala, chicken carciofi and seafood linguini were all 4+ stars. The escargot and meatball appetizers were fantastic. Thanks to Olivier for the wonderful service. Will definitely come back when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had dinner with some work colleagues here after one of them found it on Yelp. Loved everything about it including the small family ownership feel, the wine list with good varietals and plenty by the glass, the food that speaks for itself, and the cozy feel of the place despite it being in the middle of a strip mall. It is run by George and Anne Marie who made us feel welcomed as soon as we walked in the door. The variety on the menu and the daily specials made it tough to choose and everything I had I thoroughly enjoyed. No shortage of garlic or wine in the food and everyone at my table enjoyed everything immensely. So much so that there was no room to attempt to take down a dessert. I agree with other comments here that it is a neighborhood gem and would encourage people to come here regularly. You don't want something this good in your area going away because locals fail to patronize it. It gets 4 stars from me because the service was very friendly but it wasn't perfect, however, that actually makes it more approachable for regular, almost every day dining consideration. I will definitely plan to eat here when I'm in the area on business."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable atmosphere. Very nice staff . Food was great. We had Calamari appetizer very enjoyable for sure. Desert was good. Very rich . Had a great birthday dinner for my Girlfriend's birthday."}
{"text":"Had the lobster ravioli and it was delicious. Service was amazing and the owner is a character. We enjoyed our time here, would highly recommend a stop in if you're looking for a good Italian spot."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent wine and service is outstanding! Our first time here and we were absolutely delighted."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service!  They were very flexible with us making a few substitutions in our orders.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Saturday night and no last minute reservations were available at two of our go-to Italian restaurants. Checked Yelp for a local option and La Cucina rose to the top. We agree.   We started with salad, very fresh and generous. Chicken parm was excellent, spaghetti and meatballs authentic. Mussels were plentiful and cooked to order due to allergy considerations. There was total accommodation for this request. In fact, service was overall terrific. Dessert of bread pudding was also a very good.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. It's a nice restaurant that is locally owned. They make there own pasta!!!  Yummmmm I will Definitely go back and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I a wonderful Valentine's dinner at this fine establishment. I had the Osso Bucco and husband had Pasta Frutti di Mare. Both excellent. We plan on making dining here a regular occurrence."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!  True neighborhood Italian Bistro full of great wines and HAPPY people! Nobody should be eating Italian food at a chain restaurant. Authentic food and fun servers. Top notch!!"}
{"text":"I've finally made time to go to this local restaurant since I live right next to it. The minute you walk in you are welcomed and immediately you know it's going to be authentic. Quaint and quiet for a night relaxing night to kick back some vino and enjoy the BEST mussels I ever had. Omg. Great service and the unexpected of fabulous authentic Italian food. You wont be disappointed, I'm excited to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Jennifer recommended the Mama Mia wine and it was amazing.  The seafood pasta rivals the best I have ever had.  Food like this makes you think you are in a trattoria in Little Italy in NYC except you don't need to take a plane ride to get there.  Service was spot on.  Only recommendation would be to dim the lights, inside and out, in the evening for a more intimate feeling.  It will not be long until I return to try some of the other interesting items on the menu and maybe even one if the specials."}
{"text":"A total gem of a fine in North Scottsdale! Owner George is personable, extraordinarily talented in the kitchen, and someone who gives you a big warm hug when you walk in the door :). The food is absolutely delicious, the restaurant is comforting and inviting, and I eat here at least once per week! 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"These two previous reviews are hidden. I had a similar experience hearing the owner yelling at the staff in the kitchen and then seeing the servers visibly upset and nervous. I was so uncomfortable to be in a restaurant knowing that people are being treated like that. He came to our table and acted very nice but it was extremely fake. I would not want to support any business with an owner like that!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just left there, relying upon the other reviews.  We had the exact opposite experience.  We came to the mostly empty restaurant for dinner and we were seated right in front of the kitchen door.  No reason to give us the worst seat in the house.  My wife politely asked to be moved.  I ordered the ceaser salad.  It tasted awful swimming in a vingary sauce.  Our chicken Marsalas came and tasted like the chicken was cooked in a jar sauce.  At the end, the waitress drop our bill on the table.  Not an inquiry if we wanted desert.  The food was so so at best and the service was just inhospitable.  We live across the street and were very excited about our new neighbor....not anymore, we are not."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour: tasty small plates and generous pours of wine, all for $5. Good service, very friendly. We will definitely go back for dinner. A terrific addition to the neighborhood. So stop in, let's help them succeed"}
{"text":"Our first visit and everyone was friendly & very helpful. The menu was excellent and the mussels were perfect, large portion & big delicious flavor.  Love the atmosphere the food & desert is great too. A must visit when in the area thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"So delicious and great atmosphere - casual storefront. Tried the meatballs for happy hour then stayed for dinner. Shrimp and linguine for the hubby and veal parmigiana topped off with a bottle of wine and tiramisu."}
{"text":"Lovely place.  My husband and I  decided to try it out for happy hour tonight.  Enjoyed it so much we stayed for dinner and dessert!  Cozy little restaurant.  Our server Jennifer was fantastic!  She went above and beyond with her recommendations and letting us taste several wines to make sure we liked them.  Impressed that The owner George is hands on and mingles with the patrons.  Eggplant torte, the specials, and tiramisu were all delicious.  Happy to have a non chain restaurant so close to home.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a bite. Delicious filet of sole and their baked meatball was great! Homemade bread was really good! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Their service is top notch, the food is beyond delicious! Don't let the location fool you, it's small and intimate. Perfect for a last minute date night. My husband and I have been wanting to try this place since they opened. Don't let the minimal negative reviews sway you either, everyone has an off night, but I also know that people can over exaggerate their experiences. Come to this gem, you wont regret it!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best Italian food in north Scottsdale, this lil spot is an incredible neighborhood gem. Their pastas are delicious and my favorite is the linguine de mar! Bread is crusty and soft-think it's from scratch. Calamari is phenomenal as is the escargot! Love love love the owner, too! He and the bartender and servers there are super friendly! It's not a cheap restaurant but the quality is on par with pricing $$"}
{"text":"As I flew into Phoenix this lovely day, I accidentally gave my friend the wrong airport to pick me up at. Lo and behold she was at the other one and my wait was going to be a solid hour longer. Have I mentioned that I was STARVING? So I, possibly foolishly, decided to wait to eat until we got back to Scottsdale where we're staying, and this little pup jumped out at me because I wanted ALL THE FOODS. And there's nothing like Italian when you feel like eating heavy.  We were greeted by a very smiley bubbly hostess who later informed us it was her first day. Rock on sister; you killed it! We chose to seat outside where the weather was juuust right. The bread came quickly and our server Jessica was very on top of things, also very informative about the specials, which one of them we decided to try. It was a chicken breast simmered with artichokes in a lemon butter sauce with capers and an asiago, parmesan creamy risotto.  I loved most of the dish, but both myself and friend agreed that the artichokes were a bit too vinegary and it really would take over the flavors of everything around it. Besides that, the chicken was cooked to perfection. Risotto delicious. The rest was flawless. I also had a Fettucine Alfredo which was amazing, a little too much sauce per capita of pasta, but that can easily be repaired. I sunk my bread into the remaining sauce and couldn't have been happier. One thing in the future I would have done is add chicken.  The wine was tasty and smooth and we were able to bag it up and take it with us with a copy of the receipt and leaving it in the truck. We also tried the tiramisu which was wonderful... lady fingers dipped and soaked the perfect duration in the espresso, and a mascarpone cheese to die for.  Thank you for welcoming us to Scottsdale with a belly full of yum, La Cucina!"}

{"text":"Really nice Italian place with a very cozy feel! Our Friday evening dinner started with great bread -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The Chicken Marsala was tender and flavorful. The pasta with salmon and spinach (I think it's new since it isn't on their online menu) felt a little heavy but the flavor and sauce were amazing. Definitely a good local spot for delicious Italian fare!"}
