{"text":"My wife adores the chocolate chip pancakes. I appreciate the reasonable prices for the quality of food you get, especially when compared to the other breakfast places in the area. Here you can have a nice breakfast for two under $15 or $20. Also, John, the owner, and his staff, are wonderful."}
{"text":"Not ready for prime time.  Ordered Coke; received diet Coke.  Promise refill for coffee; never received it.  Food was good; service slow."}
{"text":"I thought we would try out this little place because it looked like a cute little diner. When we walked in, we weren't greeted, though 3 or 4 waitstaff saw us walk in. After a few minutes We were  seated at a decent enough table and gave the lady our drink orders when asked. Roughly 10 minutes later she came to take or order. She was very curt and to the point without the usual friendliness you would expect from a waitress. The food arrived shortly there after. The eggs were cold, the biscuits hard, the gravy was too thick and really bland. The one redeeming food was the pancakes. Those were pretty awesome. While we ate she came to fill our drinks only once. Then we sat there and sat there until I asked another waiter for our check. Then I sat there and sat there with the ticket and my credit card in hand waiting to pay the bill. By the time we finally could go once we had paid the bill, we all but ran out. Over all I was severely disappointed and will not go back again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Moon Valley Cafe for more than a decade, and was so sorry when it closed for a while...but equally delighted it reopened!  Apparently the employees pitched in and reopened the former Pinky's...the menu kept all the great stuff!  My kids love the burgers (even in the morning) but I am addicted to the omlettes (feta and spinach, smoked salmon) and their amazing chewy, dense, wonderful oatmeal that makes all other oatmeal a weak comparison.  We love the waitress's cheerful demeanor, the casual atmosphere, and that we're never hurried.  I told my husband about it, and now he goes all the time as well.  In a franchise world, this is a unique place run by local folk who care...go early and often!"}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone downhill since it was Pinky's. Last time I was there a few weeks ago the food was low side of average. This morning I had iffy service to boot. Ordered corned beef omelet thinking it was corn beef hash. Okay, my mistake, but it wouldn't have been so bad if the corned beef they used wasn't cheap lunchmeat-style corned beef! Very young waitress was as scatterbrained as any I've encountered but she was helped by the older 'regular' waitresses I've been seeing for years. Scrambled eggs were overcooked and flavorless, pancakes were chewy rather than fluffy, coffee filled right to the rim so you couldn't add cream, etc. Not a nightmare experience but very disappointing and I doubt I'll return at this point. Too bad. This used to be a fantastic neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"I have no idea why people gave this place bad comments.  The food is fresh.  The service is the best.  The place is called moon valley cafe.  Not a Mexican food establishment.   It's always busy and they do a great job.  I'm just realizing people just like to complain.  Now my amazing service professional Stephanie was and always be my favorite.   Her smile brighten my day   Great way to start my day off.   I love this place.  And if you don't please stay away.  There's enough negative people out there in the world."}
{"text":"The owner is a deadbeat and does not pay his bills!  We will never support a business that is own by someone who doesn't practice the principals that this country was founded on.  Honesty and good work ethics!"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service. The Spinach Feta Omelet was delicious. Prices are reasonable at this nice little diner.  The decor is outdated, but the food and friendly wait staff make up for it!"}
{"text":"Moon Valley Cafe was EXCELLENT!!!! Not only was the food to die for but the customer service went above and beyond what any person would expect! The manager was so friendly and welcoming! We were visiting from Albuquerque and ended up eating breakfast there twice!. The french toast was pure perfection! Each dish has the taste of homemade! This is a must try and I know we will be back again!"}
{"text":"We love this local breakfast/ lunch place.  Great value, kid friendly just what you expect at a cafe."}
{"text":"We have gone to this cafe several times and Stephanie makes our visit wonderful everytime. The food is very good and reasonably priced. This is a hidden gem at 7th Street and Thunderbird in the north valley"}
{"text":"Came to Moon Valley Cafe because we ate here last year when on a golf vacation. It used to be Pinky's and we were a little worried that the new ownership would have ruined a good diner.  On the contrary, the new ownership has made it better. Same friendly staff including the nice waitress who calls you \"Hon\", and the former quirky decor has been modernized and is very comfortable. The waitress remembered us from a year ago, and knew we were on a schedule to make a tee time so she got us our food and check as quickly as possible.   I had the rib eye and eggs three days in a row, and it was fantastic. Not your typical chewy breakfast steak but a real tender boneless rib eye.  Wife and son loved the hand smashed burger in lieu of the typical frozen patty.  Everything was cooked exactly as ordered and was hot and delicious.  Worth going out of your way for, and if you're staying at the Hilton nearby, go to Moon Valley to recover after you get over the crud they feed you at Pointe in Tyme."}
{"text":"Pros:  *Waitress brought me fruit to substitute the toast I didn't want without me having to ask her. *Waitress was able to make a good omelet recommendation, and the omelet was made differently than at other places; I believe Parmesan cheese was added, which is how some in my Italian family make it. Yum. *They carry locally-brewed organic coffee.  *The guy checking me out appeared to be an owner, and he expressed concern about whether I had sat on the side of the restaurant where the air had gone out. I sensed he would have offered a discount if I had. (The air was being fixed when I came in.) *A variety of seating for different size groups, including outdoor seating. *Food got to me quickly. *TV for watching the game.   Cons: *Omelet was a bit dry: waitress forgot to bring me salsa when I agreed to it. *Though generally good, some fruit pieces were too cold, like recently frozen, and one of the grapes was obviously a dud and should've been tossed while making the fruit sald.  *i was offered no warm-up on my coffee and no refill on my water, even though I sat empty for some time. The coffee tasted watered down. *Actually, now that I think of it, I wasn't visited by the waitress for even a check-in once my food was set down. *Very poorly decorated. They really need to bring in someone who knows what they're doing here. Also, they're implementing some tacky \"cover the tables in advertisements\" thing. It looks aweful. The place isn't cheap enough to justify supplemented income like that. *Loud; seating too close together.  Any one of these little things could've been overlooked, but they add up, unfortunately.   It was a decent breakfast for a decent price (about a dollar less than typical and about a buck fifty more than cheap diners). I'd probably take myself back here, but I wouldn't bring my mom. I wouldn't drive out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this place. It was the \"go to breakfast spot\" when it was Pinky's but has really slipped under the new name and ownersip. Service is slow even in off peak hours and bacon is cooked to almost burnt regardless of how you order it. We tried multiple times to give this place a chance, all with the same disappointing results."}
{"text":"This could be a great dinner but the service is terrible 3 stars for food which every time I go is good. which it could have been 4."}
{"text":"THEY DO NOT USE GLOVES AT ALL ... Witness the grotesque acts of the servers not using gloves when they touch your food... I am filing a complaint with the board of health and services. They use less then subpar food ... Overprice items that taste bland and disgusting. I dare you to order some bacon or sausage ......."}
{"text":"This is our morning spot. Food is consistently good. What makes this place great is the service. The staff always have a smile on their face and give it that small town cafe feel."}
{"text":"I wish it could be a three and a half star rating. The food was ok. Not great but ok. A refreshing look at down home cooking without all the frills and wannabe fancy menus. No avocado bacon Bree here.  Just eggs bacon toast. That's becoming harder to find these days. I ordered the hash and eggs and everything tasted great. The downside is the portion of hash was about three bites and most of my plate was filled with potatoes which I didn't even want. Also the price was way over the top for what you get. If I had seen he bill before the food I would have expected allot more. As far as cleanliness I would give it about six out of ten. Anywhere with syrup never gets a ten but it was a little dingy. The bathrooms were very gross. All in all I might return but not without a coupon and a wet nap."}
{"text":"Large portioned omelets and sandwiches I've had so far... This place is reasonably priced and great for a home-made breakfast or lunch.  It exceeded my food quality and service expectations. Try it out, you'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"This is another example of when I wish there was a half star option. Location is what gives this place 4 stars otherwise 3.5.   Good food, friendly staff, relaxing diner atmosphere, all make this place an enjoyable spot to stop and grab breakfast or. Lunch.   I usually order the bacon cheeseburger with fries and onion rings. It is exactly what you would expect from a diner.   I will continue to be a customer here and support my local business."}
{"text":"You've just gotta love and support Johnny Marhsall.  Food is good for a diner, but don't expect any culinary marvels.  Johnny is the main attraction and good for a dozen laughs over breakfast."}
{"text":"I am regular at the Moon Valley Cafe since I live in the neighborhood. The food is consistent and reasonably priced. As mentioned by other reviewers, the staff is friendly and accommodating. There have been times when the service is slow when it's crowded and they are short on staff. However, the other times I have been make up for that. If my poached eggs aren't done to my request (lightly poached), they happily take them back and bring me new ones. I like to get the \"eggs and hamburger\" on the breakfast menu, only with a turkey burger instead of ground beef. I will continue to be a loyal customer..."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great, basic food and wonderful service.  Not to be missed for breakfast! Cinnamon roll was melt in your mouth, even without the butter.  Omlets were outstanding.  Great coffee. Waitstaff was friendly and charming, in a down home kinda way."}
{"text":"Great little \"Hole in the wall\".  Smiling faces, good service and good food.  Hope they like us, 'cause we'll be regulars ;)"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding and the customer service was amazing . Devon , D'Angelo and Stephanie really brought joy and happiness to my heart today. They are so efficient and i will be coming back soon and will be bringing more people with me love the environment and energy. Moon valley cafe has to offer"}
{"text":"Tried to go this morning and have gone off and on for years. It's hot in there like stagnant air to start. We asked for a Half order of biscuits and gravy you and were given a full and obviously charge for a full, I asked for a child orange juice and was given a huge to go cup, we have a small child so we asked for extra napkins those never came and they never do every time we've been. Our son started getting a little crazy so we decided it was time to leave my husband asked for it to go cup and was met with a scowl from the other waitress. We won't b back"}
{"text":"The all you can eat fish fry ln was to die for and my wife had the supreme french toast Great service and very clean environment and great for kids . you have to try it"}
{"text":"A great place for lunch or breakfast, though they do an evening meals and bar, I have never partaken of it, so I will not comment on it. Breakfast, has always been plentiful and tasty. Burgers and hot dog each have their own menus. This past Saturday's special was filet mignon chunks with onions, pepper, and potatoes, two fried eggs on top. Excellent. Service has always very good and prompt."}
{"text":"Today my son and I tried breakfast at Moom Valley Cafe, it was very good. I had the Eggs Benedict and he had Breakfast Skillet and we shared their famous French Toast Supreme with Fried Bananas and Pecans. We will definitely try this place again. This place is small inside by they do have outside seating so if it's cool outside that is where we will seat next time."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has the star rating it does. I went in last week. Sat down at a table. Not even 10 mins there and a roach ran across the front of my shoe. That grossed me out. Didn't even order. It used to be good but the food, service and cleanliness has gone so far down hill in the last few weeks. I will not return again."}
{"text":"The Friday All-You-Can-Eat fish @$9.99 is a great value. Take-out gets you 3 pieces for that price; still a good deal. Add a squirt of the fresh lemon provided, to the better than average coleslaw, and you have a new taste dimension."}
{"text":"I had another great experience at Moon Valley!! This place is truly great and I absolutely appreciate the phenomenal service and food they have to offer.  Keep it up guys you never let me down!  I would highly recommend Moon Valley to ANYONE and EVERYONE!!  It's a must try, best restaurant in the area, honestly."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place. Prices are good, the coffee is great and seemingly bottomless, breakfast choices excellent, friendly attentive staff, what's not to like? Three colleagues and myself have breakfast every Friday morning and will continue for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Great Food, and 3.00 Mimosa's any day.  Not your mama's café, even better"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars cause the food is great! Unfortunately the service is horrible. I went twice to give them the benefit of the doubt. Both times it took them 40 mins to get the food to us. Chalked it up to being busy on the weekend however busy should never be in a waitress vocabulary. No water refills and never checked on us after food was given to us. Both times!! Different waitress! I will have to think twice about going back."}
{"text":"What a great place.  I have been going since it was Pinky's.  The staff is always friendly, always remembers me and the prices are perfect.  The kids LOVE the French toast.  I am just glad you can get lunch any time of the day and a beer to boot. Love the staff and the chef Mario. Great place for food and fun.. PLUS they have a cool pet patio for my baby girls."}
{"text":"Real good food at killer prices. Had biscuits and gravy which was pretty good and they cooked my eggs a perfect over easy. The bacon was excellent! And like I said KILLER prices!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple times now, the first time we sat at the counter and struggled getting our coffee refilled...the staff made more of a point socializing than tending to customers, but the food was good.   After a few weeks we came back for a second try....there were four tables of two or less and a couple people at the counter, AGAIN trying to get your coffee refilled was ridiculous!!  The waitress even answered her cell and stepped outside while we were waiting on service...WORST of all this was right in front of the owner!!!   They won't get a chance on a third strike and it's a shame cause I LOVED the omelette!  If you have all the time in the world eat here...just read the other reviews as well."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today with a friend and the food was decent but the service was terrible. It took forever to even get water, then when we got our food my friend didn't even get utensils or napkins and neither did i. i finished eating my burger and had no where to clean myself so i had to get up and ask for one. and i just didn't feel welcomed so definitely not the best visit."}
{"text":"The food was good but not great.  I ordered the burrito, which the menu sated as \"huge\".  I would definitely disagree on that one.  It was average sized and other than salsa, that's all you get.  I also had a cinnamon roll, which was cold and hard.  The service was good but based on the burrito and the roll, I don't think I would try it again."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and it was a great value for the money. Owner at the front is a nice guy. Only complaint was our waitress, but I think she may have been new and still finding her groove.  Other than that, a-ok."}
{"text":"Second time going to moon valley cafe. Food and service was wonderful.  **the only reason I'm giving it such a low rating is because they allowed a couple to eat inside the restaurant with their DOG sitting on the bench of the booth with them. That's unsanitary and they should have been told to eat on the patio with the dog. And this wasn't a service dog... Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in a LONG time. Highly recommend this wonderful mom and pop diner.  If you're looking for a great breakfast spot with wonderful staff, don't pass this up."}
{"text":"Delish! Totally worth the drive in the rain....super good food, quick service by really nice people, and good price!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast after a hike. Stopped by on Thanksgiving and Kim was very friendly, quick with the coffee refills and just great. Will definitely return. Seems like the regulars like it as well. She knew most everyone in here. Was very tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since a few years ago with an ex. I brought my now bf today to introduce him to this place. They have good giant cinnamon rolls now which he loved. One thing is that the waitress forgot his toast within 5-10 min of his meal but got it with apologies. Good potatoes- \"home fries\"- which i always ask for a side of them. Good nice servers who remembered me after a couple years. My dad lives near there so i have to take him to try a cinnamon roll. He would love it. Very good food"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!  Sat on the patio with the over cast weather enjoying ice tea with a great breakfast!  Chicken fried steak was one of the best in town and the French toast was perfect."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten there, and the last time. I had the ham and eggs. The ham was a cheap canned ham. The eggs and hash browns were ok. I saved the ham for my dogs. I would not recommend this place. On the other hand the staff was great!"}
{"text":"First time there this morning, service was a little slow apparently a waitress called in sick. Food came out quick, ham steak and eggs for me and French toast for my wife. Everything was super delicious the 12 grain toast I got with my breakfast was some of the best toast I've ever had. I only had one complaint, jelly selection poor and brand was cheap. You need to step it up in that department. Other than that sounds like this is a new found breakfast restaurant for us. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I went to the Cafe on Thursday and the service was great! The food was great I would recommend the place."}
{"text":"Really liked the service, friendly folks who make you feel at home. Prices are very reasonable. Got the $3.99 weekday special and for $1.00 more got biscuits and gravy. The sausage was very good for a deal like this. Good food, good people."}
{"text":"We went this past Sunday morning. Giving one star for the bus boy that took better care of us than our server. One of our worst dining experiences. We came in for breakfast and weren't sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or what. No one greeted us, many workers around, but no acknowledgement. It was not overly busy. We finally asked and were told \"Yeah, sit wherever you want\" from a server passing by. Our server gave my husband a menu and said she'd be right back with another for me. That didn't happen, after several minutes go by the busser saw that I didn't have a menu and gave me one. Took quite a while for her to make it back to us to take our order. She was completely disorganized, digging through the mass amount of tickets and papers filling her apron trying to find a pen. We ended up ordering an appetizer. The menu said \"pick any 4 above for 13.99. Husband asked for mozz and zucchini sticks, poppers, and wings. The server comes back 15 minutes later and says the wings aren't one of the choices that we can get with the combo platter and that it comes with o-rings, mozz and zuc sticks, and poppers. Husband asked why it said that we could \"pick 4\" if she's now saying that it has to comes with those 4 specific things. They went back and forth about it for a while and ultimately they gave us chicken fingers instead of the wings. Frustrated already, we agreed that we wouldn't order our meals here, have the appetizer and leave. The appetizer was very skimpy for the price. We've had way better apps at better establishments for less. Came with 2 chicken fingers, 4 poppers, 4 cheese sticks, and 6 very small zucchini sticks. The chicken fingers were hot, the other items cold. Told a girlfriend of mine that we went there and before I could even start in on my story, she said, \"That place is   awful\"! Won't be back."}
{"text":"We come up to Phoenix at least once a year and have finally found a great simple place for breakfast. The food was really good and the staff was really nice. The prices were definitely reasonable. We would definitely go back and support this local business again."}
{"text":"OK is really all I can say so far.  This is my second visit.  This time for lunch.  The food is good.  Service OK.  Just nothing to get excited about.  I was one of the younger people in the place...and I'm 60.  So, not sure.  My first visit was breakfast and it was much better."}
{"text":"My aunt and I were out seeking a cafe that  would serve  mimosas and bloody Mary's as we'll as a delicious breakfast while we visited.  We found this gem of a cafe and were delightfully surprised.  A very casual atmosphere with really cheerful employees makes this an obvious hot spot in Moon Valley.  Our waiter efficiently served us our drinks and tasty entrees.  We had vegetarian omelettes that were perfectly sized with homemade potatoes.  We lingered and were never rushed out the door.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and excellent service. My only complaint is the coffee was not very good. Could have been a bad pot or two. Will try again when we come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I use to love this place but it has gone way down hill since Candy left in my opinion. Some staff and the owner have gotten so negative and petty. I do not go in there to hear high school rants. The food has gotten terrible as well. I do not appreciate being questioned where I eat by the help. I went to this place through 3 former owners and it saddens me what has happened to the quality of the food served and the awful mean owner and some staff at  this café. The sides of table usually not clean. Take the caps off hot sauce and you can tell they are never cleaned. The servers take your money then go butter someone's toast without washing their hands. All while the owner sits at the counter as if nothing is wrong. Last time I was in I saw 2 roaches. Gross. It saddens me as this place use to be my hangout for many years. I guess change is in order."}
{"text":"Looked for a nice comfy casual place for breakfast. Glad we found this place. Easy, unassuming and great service by Candi. Thanks for feeding us!"}
{"text":"Usually a good place to eat. I generally pop in on occasion for breakfast. Today I needed to get breakfast so I could give blood this morning. I arrived shortly before 7:00 and the cook was still not there. They open at 6:00. I left about 7:05 with no food or cook. They should just close for the day if this is their only cook. I did wonder why there were only three customers there when I arrived usually at that time of day."}
{"text":"My order corned beef omelette whatever the corned beef meet is chewy not the one I expected to , don't recommend this food ."}
{"text":"Fun diner with a unique offering of Pancake Rolls. Broad menu with an area that allows tv football viewing and alcohol.  Clear family area with diner vibe. Patio comfortable but employee smoke breaks do impact diners. Everything is very clean!   Definitely a value and will try again."}
{"text":"This was an awful experience. Waited forever for the waitress to take our order. The wrong food came. When the correct mea did arrive it was gross. Then I was sent home with freezing cold apple pie! Worst dining experience in Moon Valley ever!"}
{"text":"Meh. Pricey and not that great. Too bad as it has plenty of potential. The outdoor patios could be a lot more inviting. The interior could use some sprucing up."}
{"text":"Perfect place for bland, salty food and poor service.  The toaster was malfunctioning and the place smelt of burning plastic. Inexplicably the staff continued to use it. When paying for the meal the hostess took my card without saying thank you or making eye contact. Quite honestly I don't know why people go here or how it stays in business."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped by for lunch while we were in the area for her dance competition. The while staff was amazing, friendly and helpful. You'll find the owner happily chatting up the regulars and newcomers, like ourselves. The food was delicious and served fast. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you wanna enjoy a nice breakfast in a relaxed environment this is the place to go! Great food, great service, and awesome prices!"}
{"text":"The best onion rings around! I love that I can order lunch in the morning since eggs upset my stomach. The bacon cheese burger is wonderful & I love the friendly staff. We can eat here for the same cost as a fast food restaurant, inexpensive & good food.  I also like that I can order an alcoholic beverage any time, although I never have."}
{"text":"Tasty solid breakfast, very friendly service and good value for $$.  I was pleased to find out that you can go in and have a long cool one after work and it was not just a breakfast place.  I'm a fan of locally owned and run venues and hope to return to try an evening meal there and would gladly recommend the breakfast so far!"}
{"text":"Mushroom burger with fries. Huge hamburger, lots of toppings. Inspite of that it was rather bland. Fries were great.  Country fried steak and over medium eggs with wheat toast. Steak was good, eggs were over easy (as noted by the waitress, her error.) Toast was toast.  Decor is lacking, they took the cafe motif to a new level and not a cool retro Mayberry cafe from the Andy Griffith show, more like a place from the sticks of Alabama.  Anyway, spent 35.00, including tip, on two meals. Nothing sucked, but nothing was good either. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Stephany is the main reason I come to the cafe.  The is always prepared to how I ordered it."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all of the negative reviews. We had an excellent breakfast! Lox plate was huge and excellent- a grilled bagel with cream cheese, capers, onions and more smooth, smokey buttery lox than I could eat. Wife had eggs bennie and loved it. Son had  a huge Belgian waffle and licked his plate. Daughter loved her French toast. Super friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot ! Friendly , good food , reasonable prices , what else do you want ? Maybe a home made cinnamon bun ?"}
{"text":"Sorry folks this place is not for me, the service is lousy the servers are career servers so the don't care about anything but the tips not the service, I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs and it all was out of a box the gravy was like plaster the chicken fried steak was not eatable it was dropped in a deep fat fryer and was eatable, I guess you could eat it if you where just looking to fill your gut. Not for me sorry I wont ever be back to this Diner."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Greasy Spoon  Today, my lunch companion and I stopped by Moon Valley Cafe for lunch. I want to start off on a positive note by saying the staff at Moon Valley Cafe are very friendly and the service is very good. That's why I feel terrible for calling out their food as being, to be honest, flavorless, and just not very good   On this visit we had the chicken stew with biscuit and the fried chicken strip salad and to be honest both entrees,  just were not good. The chicken on both entrees tasted overcooked, and the chicken stew lacked flavor. The entire meal was disappointing.   Denny's or IHOP would be a  less expensive option."}
{"text":"I'd have to pretty desperate to ever go back. The people were very nice & friendly but they seemed short staffed because it took several minutes to get menus, several more to get drinks and 1/2 hour to get our food after that-it was pretty good though. The scariest part was when I went to the ladies room and saw what looked like a cockroach make a brief appearance out of the pic on the wall and uncleanliness of the bathroom. How hard is it to clean bathroom? Eww!"}
{"text":"Went back for lunch and had a sandwich and nachos.  This place is still awesome."}
{"text":"Great service and food. We even moved outside still great service and food. We returned today had a wonderful time service was great and they made great margaritas! Will be back !"}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood breakfast place. Free wifi, enthusiastic staff, good food. They are getting a liquor license soon, too.  I like their omelettes (corned beef! what!?), and I had the house burger for lunch one day. It's not gourmet, but I love mushrooms and swiss so it was just right for me.  it's a very busy place, but the girls work hard. Don't be ignorant, since you can see the kitchen window and you can see how fast everyone moves. It's never been an unreasonable wait.  Prices can't be beat. If you are on a budget, you can enjoy a nice meal here.  Good for families, couples, and elderly alike."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cafe style food was edible barely. It was ok there are way too many other  places around to eat. I will not be back for lunch. The locals got better service then we did. Our waitress was really nice though!!"}
{"text":"They have a solid breakfast here at a low price. If you are looking for a good old fashioned diner look no further. One thing that was really good here that was above and beyond any other place was the bacon. I will order an extra side next time I am there."}
{"text":"Fourth or fifth time here.  Don't no why I go back. Convenient I guess. Food is ok but what irritates me is how servers talk to me and others.  Love bug, honey pie , babe , lovey are not appropriate. Hate to be stick in the mud.   But unless you know me, sir or friend or ask me my name works.  And when a guest asks what's good have a response ready. Not just everything on the menu.  This place could be so much better"}
{"text":"I read a comment about a pathetic $5.00 breakfast and could only think that he was at a different restaurant!  The plates at Monn Valley Cafe are overflowing with great food.  Never had a bad meal there.  Friendly staff, very clean.  I'll take clean any day over fancy ambiance or soft music."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is delicious, the portions are a good size for the money, and the staff is very friendly. I highly recommend the Reuben, and the chicken fried steak. A few months ago I ordered the chef salad and it was the best chef salad I had ever had. They really took painstaking time to make it look gorgeous and it was huge. Then a few weeks ago I ordered the chef salad again and it was beyond boring...obviously prepared by two different people which was very disappointing. Now the owner has opened a new place across the street, however I feel his investment should have gone to making this gem sparkle even more, maybe some updated upholstered booths...either way this place is a must try and we will definitely consider ourselves regulars."}
{"text":"Very nice cafe, stopped in for some breakfast and they had some great $5 specials that both my wife and I got and liked a lot. Friendly staff and clean tables. I got pancakes and my wife got eggs and bacon. It wasn't spectacular by any means but did the job of filling us up."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and service. Love their cfs and home fries. Its always busy but never a long wait."}
{"text":"Your standard little breakfast and lunch cafe. Nothing fancy but good food and good service. I enjoyed the breakfast burrito with chorizo and the Hubs enjoyed an omelette. They do serve mimosas and bloodies so I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great location to meet people for breakfast and love the option of sitting outside while it is still nice out. The food was mediocre, nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either. We got a large selection from omlettes to pancakes, everyone enjoyed their food. Good place to check out if you're in town."}
{"text":"I've been to Dennys , I-Hop and all these big breakfast places and they're all horrible. Sat at dennys for 10 minutes not even a soul came to say hi or anything.  They just don't care about customer service.  Moon Valley Cafe took 1 minute for us to walk in, we had our menus and drinks in front of us. It's just way different than them. Treat you with respect and the food is lovely. The owner is awesome and the servers are phenomenal. I will never walk into any other breakfast place other than Moon Valley Cafe. I recommend this place over any of those bigger restaurants any day."}
{"text":"Decor- 1980's. Wood panels halfway up the walls, vinyl booths, mismatched colors.   Service- waitress was nice  Moon Valley Cafe is located where Pinky's cafe used to be. I live nearby so I had high hopes for this place. I've been twice, the second visit in hopes that it would be better than the first. After my second visit, I will certainly not return.   On each of my 2 visits, I ordered items off the menu that were supposed to be their specials. First visit I ordered their French Toast. This came out bland, the toast was thin, syrup was poor quality. Nothing exciting. I think I paid around $7.00 and have had much better french toast for this price. Not that cheap, and not that good.   Second visit, I ordered Eggs Benedict. It was about $8.50, came with a hash brown. Hash brown was not flavorful nor cooked through. The shredded potatoes tasted raw, and almost like they had freezer burn. They were cold in the middle. The ham on the eggs Benedict was Hormel style ham, not fresh or good quality. The poached eggs were so overcooked and hard I could not eat them. Especially for something that is supposed to be their special, these should have been cooked with more care. The Hollandaise sauce was fair. I used the English muffin to eat the sauce- left everything else on my plate.   The worst part of the 2nd visit was the heat inside the place. When I walked in and was hit by a wave of heat that made me want to turn around and leave. It was almost an aversive feeling. Some ceiling fans were running on low- not effective in cooling the place. It felt as if the AC was out. I mentioned this to the waitress, who commented \"its 70 degrees in here\". Knowing it was certainly note, I looked at the thermostat and pointed out that it actually read 80 degrees. Who wants to come sit on vinyl benches to sweat through their shorts in an 80 degree cafe with bad food? Especially in late June when temps exceed 100?  Not me again.   Too bad MV Cafe- I really wanted you to be good. So long"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here. The fare is basic cafe. The service was good and friendly. The food was good, although my portions were on the small side."}
{"text":"First Time Experience & Man it was Groovy! Everyone that works there is welcoming and works as a team! They have good specials morning and lunch time! I got the cheeseburger with a free drink and PIE! The peanut butter pie was delicious! Definitely recommend this place! I told my family and friends and once you try this place out, Trust me you will enjoy it like I did and inform everyone you know!!"}
{"text":"I should have saved room for one of the homemade desserts. The eggs Benedict was fantastic. They grill the English muffin and the butter it. It was nice change of pace for a perfectly poached egg and creamy hollandaise sauce to sit upon. The hash browns were hot and crispy. Service at the counter was good."}
{"text":"A quaint little place that I never even looked twice at before my mom took me there, it's between Safeway and Dunkin Donuts so I always had other motives for entering the plaza. Now, it's our weekly breakfast date the staff remembers our orders, they always greet you as you walk in the door \"sit where you'd like\" type stuff. The chicken fried steak is the only thing I ever order, but from what I've gathered from taking other family members and friends their other breakfast foods are quite as well. It's definitely become one of my weekly places."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn on how to review MVC. We were greeted within a few seconds of walking in and asked if we could sit at the bar (we like to watch the kitchen action) and the hostess said sure, and walked away.  We sat ourselves and quickly realized we didn't have menus.  We waited for a waitress to come by, but after about 5 minutes my fiancee just got up and grabbed us some.  What appeared to be the owner was standing by where the menus were and noticed him grabbing our own, and apologized for the oversight (so that was really fine).    After another few minutes our waitress came over, and was actually very friendly throughout the rest of the time there. I ordered the pancakes with eggs and ham and he had the french toast with meats. The ham steak and eggs were cooked perfectly.  My pancakes looked good, but when flipped over, they were burned on the other side.  His sausage, ham, bacon and eggs were also cooked perfectly but the French Toast was just okay.  (see pics for reference)  The big down side was really listening to the other waitresses that came up to the counter to pick up things complaining about the other patrons in the restaurant.  It was rather awkward to sit there and overhear them bad mouth people sitting on just the other side of the restaurant.    Overall: B Skip the pancakes or french toast if you go, but the meats and eggs are great! Bar waitress was nice, but be aware you may end up listening to the other waitresses complaints while sitting there - yikes!"}
{"text":"The table was not clean, we have to ask for clean silverware, The Waitresses were not in a hurry to take your order. Both of us had a upset stomach within 30 minutes of leaving, we have no desires to return."}
{"text":"Well I had heard good things about this place, and wanted to try it out for lunch. According to the website their hours are 6 am till 3 pm. I did not see a hours sign on the building, but we walked in at 2pm sharp. We found our seats, and the buss boy was very friendly, and got us drinks promptly. Then the waitress came to take our order. She simply asked us what we wanted to order since the kitchen was about too close. We found this to be very rude. Had we walked in at ten till 3 we might have understood, but we were there an hour before their posted closing time. We ordered our food and when it came out, mine had toppings that were not listed on the menu. It also at mayo, that was not listed on the menu, which was soaked into the bread. The cook put a handful of pickle slices on the plate, and the juice from the pickles soaked into the bread as well. At this point I was too frustrated to send it back. At about 2:25, my mother was finished with her plate, and I had finished my fries, the waitress came over and asked my mother if she would like more tea. My mom responded asking for a half glass. Then the server asked if she would prefer a to-go cup, in a way of telling us to get out of the restaurant. This was a very disappointing experience. I do feel bad because the owner seemed like a very nice guy, and it is unfortunate he is stuck with a staff such as this."}
{"text":"Always a favorite of ours when we are in Moon Valley: great food, great service, great people! Killer bakery goods too!!!"}
{"text":"I had passed this place a few times and always saw lots of cars here, so I decided to give this place a try for breakfast this morning. When I got here, it was pretty empty but filled up quickly shortly after I got there.   Food - 3 Star rating: Their menu is large with many items to choose from. They offer pancakes, waffles, French toast, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches and burritos, burgers, sandwiches, salads, and much more. I decided to do the breakfast burrito. It is made of eggs, cheese, potatoes and choice of meat. I decided on the ham. Comes with salsa. Paid $.725. Came out quickly, but the taste was really disappointing. First off, the burrito seemed like it was mostly hashbrowns with some eggs and ham. I didn't even taste any cheese, so not sure if there was any in my burrito. On top of that, nothing was seasoned. It was so plain, I had to try and add some flavor with the hot sauce and some ketchup, but it was a fail. Was only able to force myself to eat half of the burrito.   Atmosphere - 3 Star rating: Everything in this place seems old and original. Not that it was bad, but it could use some updating. It definitely has that \"mom and pop\" feeling to it. It was clean but seemed really cluttered, kind of like when you go to your grandmother's place.   Staff - 5 Star rating: The best thing about this place was the staff. From the lady that told us to seat ourselves where ever we wanted to our waitress and the lady that checked us out. They all had smiling facing and seemed really cheerful. Our waitress came by several times to check up on us. She brought our menus right away and took both drink and food orders quickly. She was very accommodating and helpful with requests.   Not sure if I'll come back again or not, but if I do I'll probably stick to something on the lunch menu.   Hours of operation:  Monday - Saturday 6 am to 2:30 pm Sunday 7 am to 2:30 pm"}
{"text":"My first visit here, a client of mine recommend it to me. I stopped in for breakfast with my daughter.  The place was clean and the staff was very nice!  We had eggs, sausage and french toast. The food was very good!  They were busy the entire, and the service was still great.  Their homemade pies look wonderful, I'll definitely have to try them next time!  We will be back!  I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Typical diner with a great view of North Mountain. There were a lot of regulars and the wait-staff was very friendly. The coffee was also good which doesn't seem that common in places like this. We sat outside to enjoy the cool morning and didn't feel neglected by the waitress. My ham omelette with white toast and hashbrowns was done well and was filling. Great breakfast in the north valley."}
{"text":"The server actually had to apologize to me as she presented me what looked like the most pitiful pathetic five dollar breakfast sandwich..  1 Egg: 7.00/60 = .12 1 slice american processed 1.69/lb= .11 1 english muffin 1.49/6 = .24 2 slices bacon 2.39lb 1oz= .15 Total Food Cost .62  about a 12% food cost.. Thanks Moon Valley Cafe.. Glad to see you aren't ripping anyone off.."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, this place is as bad as it gets!  We sat at the counter and watched the servers argue with each other and then the kitchen staff and then the hostess THE ENTIRE TIME.  I feel like we were waiting for a brawl to break out.  We sat for a good 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  We ordered the steak and eggs with home fries along with a half order of biscuits and gravy to share.  I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare.  I love my steak rare but this thing came out beyond mooing... it was also very under seasoned.  I also didn't get my home fries they gave me hash browns instead.  At one point one of the younger servers told me \"I'm sorry they usually don't fight like this\" this girl was genuinely embarrassed. We just picked at our food for about 15 minutes, paid and then left... NEVER AGAIN.  Try The Perk Eatery, 40th St. Cafe or The Original Breakfast House instead!"}
{"text":"What a great breakfast spot and a dog friendly patio.   Great friendly attentive wait staff, clean and the food is very good.   We will return"}
{"text":"If you want your to go order to be hot, don't go here. I walked in, food was literally ready sitting on counter. The waitress took 10 minutes to put it in a bag and throw the dressing in. She was more focused on chatting it up with her male co worker than customers. Fries were insanely cold. My work is very close, I spent more time waiting for her to give me my food than I did to drive to and from (total). A waste of $12 of my hard earned cash!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to place for Lunch.  Their Liver & Onions is wonderful.  Chicken & Biscuit Stew is pretty yummy also.   Breakfast is very good too. I like the wait staff too.  As I said my favorite place ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's old school diner breakfast with great food and great service. The best cup of coffee in town coupled with delicious food. The chicken fried steak is a must as well as everything else!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. It's like any side-of-the-road diner you'll find while traveling. They give you plenty of food and they have great specials. Might be back if I'm staying at the nearby resort again."}
{"text":"Saw a review on social media where the owner reviews this restaurant. Of course he touted it! Only problem is his picture was on the review lmao!! Seem to remember the same happening on yelp a year or so back also lmao!"}
{"text":"I am not one to give out one stars...so this is going to be difficult. I went to Moon Valley cafe in the hopes of getting Mexican food (they own the place next door), but during the day this portion of their restaurant is closed.  Waited for the server for quite a while. I ended up with a beef sandwich and my son had a burger. I order some to go items from their other restaurant for the rest of the family.  The sandwich was dry and flavorless. My son (who usually eats a whole burger) only ate a small amount of his food and said he didn't like it. The wait for the food and check was VERY long.  Finally was able to get the attention of the waitress....for check and to go items.  The food was overpriced, to go items were nonexistent. Sorry I am not waiting another hour for a burrito.  Not going back."}
{"text":"This place is in our neighborhood, and we have been coming here for years.  It has been an average place to get quick \"diner food\".  Today's experience......not so good. It's Labor Day, and the manager/owner has either tremendously underestimated the number of customers they would be serving, and hence did not have enough staff scheduled, or maybe a couple people called in sick.  I was meeting my husband for breakfast after the gym, and I arrived first.  The place was packed, and staff was running like crazy.  They told me to sit anywhere, and the only open table I could find was in a corner, behind the door, of the back room.  No one acknowledged me.  I was sitting there with no water, no menu, no set-up, etc. Staffers were walking by me like I wasn't there.  Finally, I got up and walked into the main room.  One of the staff said, \"I'll be right with you.\"  She sent in a nice server named Rachel. It took forever to get anything, because the place was so busy and short-staffed. Rachel did her best, but she had a large-party table as well as other smaller ones.   We kept noticing several tables that came in after us we already being served, eating, paying and leaving. Rachel told us that the printer in the kitchen had malfunctioned and our order never printed out.  That's why people who arrived after us were being served before us.   It was an hour, from the time that I walked in, before our food arrived. Rachel was very apologetic about the printer and said she was going to go ask the owner what he could do for us.  The entire meal should have been comp'd.  The ancient, stingy owner-guy, apparently with zero understanding of the importance of retaining repeat customers, gave us our drinks for free (coffee was horrendous, by the way -- the equivalent of tasteless, brown, dishwater) and 20% off our food.  It was a hour and a half before we finally got out of there.  Paid cash instead of credit because we were tired of waiting. Not a good way to spend our time or money on a holiday morning. Doubtful we will be back."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great service, cool little place for a nice quiet breakfast at the corner of 7st & T-bird.  Been here before but it has been some time, I ordered the eggs benedict and I licked my plate.  Fantastic meal and had 3 cups of coffee (2 above normal)  What can I say, this place is pretty cool and a hidden gem if you ask me.  Very casual and I am pretty sure the same waitress helped me both times."}
{"text":"A fantastic, inexpensive diner setting on the edge of an old shopping center. I tried the breakfast burrito with meat, bacon, and was amazed at the size of it when they brought it quickly and promptly.   Delicious food, fast and friendly service, warm inviting atmosphere. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back myself.   Excellent prices make this a must."}
{"text":"This is a simple little cafe/diner with a homey vibe and friendly staff. I showed up with my friends having been seated already. Shortly after I sat down I was offered coffee, in fact I was offered refills on my coffee frequently and if I so chose I'm certain my cup would never have been empty.  I had the Eggs Benedict, my go-to breakfast dish at a new restaurant. I'm a bit of a picky eater when it comes to eggs, I like a entirely cooked white with a runny yolk. My eggs were poached perfectly! The hollandaise was done very well and overall I really enjoyed my dish. Along side my Eggs Benedict I had home fries, which were wonderful.  Great food, friendly service and a homie vibe mean I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town hands down. I drive FAR to eat here and do it on a regular basis. Great breakfast at a fair price and friendly staff. I just wish I was closer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a really good first experience here.  Service was fast and the food was tasty and very reasonably priced.  Our waitress Carrie Ann was so friendly and on the ball with our service.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite little place to go for breakfast in the neighborhood where I live . I eat there all the time. The $5.00 breakfast special, which is only good on weekdays of course, can't be beat anywhere.  The service is great, the food a tasty, and the prices are fair which is everything I am looking for in a breakfast and lunch spot. As a bonus they have good Wifi so I bring my IPAD with me and surf the web when eating alone.  Try it, you will be back."}
{"text":"Went by Moon Valley Cafe for breakfast a couple times in the last few weeks. This is a great, no frills, old school breakfast place right in the neighborhood.  Almost a classic diner style atmosphere.  Service was excellent and the menu is good yet not over complicated. The weekday breakfast deal has 4 or 5 great choices for 5 bucks. Eggs were cooked just as ordered, bacon was crisp but not over done. The wait staff takes good care of you and fills your coffee with perfect timing. If you like good food, good service and good value without the extra fan fare of the chain places, definitely hit this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Friendly staff and hot food. Just wish the burrito had more sausage. Would have given 4 stars if it did."}
{"text":"Great local cafe.  Pretentious Scottsdale whiners need not apply.  Try the breakfast burrito :D"}
{"text":"This gets my vote as one of my neighborhood's inexpensive breakfast houses.  I enjoyed ham and eggs with a side of three large buttermilk pancakes and hot syrup.$6.95  Plus a cup of coffee. My meal was very good.  The service was friendly, polite, and efficient. There's a very local feeling to this bright and clean diner."}
{"text":"The single most horrid dining experience ever. Construction during breakfast?  Are you kidding me?!?  For years this place has been a \"satellite office\" where you could meet people, have a simple but good quality breakfast,  wait staff were amazing, all at a locally owned business that's been a staple in the neighborhood as long as I've lived in Moon Valley,  over 20 years.   Most wait staff we've come to know have left, the food is decidedly not as good, and now this: a breakfast meeting attempting an involved conversation punctuated by concrete being drilled directly adjacent to my table.   I'm not a business owner,  so maybe I'm misguided, but I would think that if you have a business that makes its mission to serve breakfast and lunch, and you need to have heavy construction done, you might have the contractor do the loud stuff when you're closed?"}
{"text":"Cute old school mid-west style diner with real folksy folks. Stick with the basics like bacon, eggs and potatoes rather than their supreme french toast or the steak n' eggs. I shall return!"}
{"text":"Pretty good hole in the wall breakfast place.  I liked the $4 breakfast special.  If you like to explore local breakfast stops this is a cheap and will get the job done."}
{"text":"Today was our first time eating here and it was awesome! Everyone was friendly very attentive and very welcoming. I would give 10 stars if allowed! Will make this our new go to spot. Also very budget friendly and the food is delicious:)"}
{"text":"I have read the reviews written here, and dings on decor and noise. I can see where people are coming from, but the food was phenomenal, and reminded me very much of my childhood. I had the chicken fried steak and it was AWSOME, I actually shared with the table so they could experience it.   The place was busy, food was wonderful, waitress was friendly, and we will be back!  I am so glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing little hole in the wall. Massive food portions at reasonable prices. $3 mimosa's! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"A lot of good and bad going on here at breakfast time.   The good? Friendly servers. Coffee refilled promptly. Classic décor. Eat at the counter if you like. Regulars evident. I really like the overall vibe. I even like the advertisements imbedded in the table tops.  The bad? The restaurant was not busy and I cannot imagine why it took so long to prepare a simple breakfast platter on this day. I didn't time it, but it took so long I had time to read my entire newspaper. Twice. The pancakes then looked great, but they were tough and even difficult to cut. Not good. An issue of consistency. A request for crisp bacon was not honored, a recurring pet peeve of mine I'll admit, but interesting given another recent reviewer complained about burned bacon. Consistency issues again. It's also a bit on the expensive side for a traditional breakfast spot, perhaps just because the specials don't suit my needs.  I'll be back, searching for reasons to add a star to this review. I love the place and the people and fully expected to write a four or five star review. I'm thinking of trying a meal other than breakfast, perhaps an all you can eat spaghetti night with the five and six year olds in my life. I also noted an emphasis on beer sales and even live entertainment, so maybe they're just trying to do too many things at this point in time to truly excel at breakfast. If I were the owner, consistently fluffy pancakes would be my priority."}
{"text":"This place is very good place for home good food .  But I don't like my bacon hard and brunt .  Lots of ppl . Very noisy.  Cream pie very good ."}
{"text":"After a flight from hell and time change all I wanted was some good quick breakfast so on my way home from the airport I called in a order to my neighborhood cafe. I got the corn beef hash with eggs over med and hash browns but they had a wide variety of sides to choose from...when I arrived it was a very cute set up my food was ready to go. Once home I opened it up and it was nice and hot and my hash browns were perfect!!! Can't wait to try them again!!!!"}
{"text":"This the worst place.  I sat down was not greeted and waited forever to place my order.  Would not go back.  And it was not that busy. Then my eggs were cold!"}
{"text":"I love this place, so don't go!!  Stay away!!  I want it all for myself!!!   I have been going here since the Pinkie days and I think it is just as good if not better. The food is great and I love all of the servers. Even the ones that call me Sweetie, honey-pie or all the other nice nick-names they come up with. They always remember me and make sure my meal is tasty and friendly.  But, you won't like it, so don't go!!  Let me have this great place to myself. John, the owner, has never failed to say hello and visit for a minute when he is not running around the place.   And to the Scottsdale reviewer....   I love this line from your review, \"....what irritates me is how servers talk to me and others using terms of endearment. \" REALLY??!!  Dude, you're in a cafe/ diner! That's how it's supposed to be. Scottsdale is happy to treat you like a number, stay over there.  So, remember, do not go here! It is delicious and tasty and VERY friendly."}
{"text":"They were very helpful and prompt service. Our hiking group plans on coming here every Sunday. Everyone enjoyed their food. Thank you, Gene"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Nothing fancy just great comfort food. I recommend corned beef hash!!"}
