{"text":"Excellent!

-Free Guacamole during happy hour!
-HUGE menu
-Ordered a salad, gazpacho, grilled octopus, and artichoke appetizer.  All were DELICIOUS!
-Friendly and attentive waitstaff.

Only negative--Sangria was just OK.  

Will definitely return! Great place!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and fantastic food both times. Noisy but that's because it is so good and busy. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here last night.  Our waiter was attentive, and answered all our questions about the food and wine menus.  The food was excellent.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!! We went there last night, a Monday night the service was just right not too much, but always right there, kind and gracious. Then the food the 3 of us had the specials all fish specials, not inexpensive, 32-36 range BUT I must say some of the best we have had.  That kitchen staff should be loved, massaged, and stroked.  The entire meal was wonderful from garlic soup with poached egg to almond cake and Spanish coffee made tableside. Do not miss this jewel. We won't"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place! To start, we couldn't get seated right away, so the bartender gave us a round of shots on the house (even though we only waited 3 minutes for our table to be ready). Had a sangria which was nothing exceptional but satisfied me. I had the bacon wrapped quail which was delicious and creme brûlée. We ended the meal with another free round of shots (an amaretto like liquor). Needless to say if you like free alcohol this is your place. The waiters were all very funny and attentive and made the experience all the better. I'm just disappointed I live on the east side and won't be in Westlake more often to come here."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! Service, food, atmosphere all an A+.  We will definitely be back. Vladimir was a magician making the martinis"}
{"text":"I went back for the grilled Octopus and found more favorites. The menu is so extensive, plus there were quite a few specials it almost was difficult to choose  between all of the options.
The service is always superb and food is wonderful. Looking forward the next visit."}
{"text":"Went in with no anticipation.  The outside of the building does not prepare you for the inside.  Loved the throwback interior and felt like we were transported to a time when the customer was treated to dinner.  Maitre d' and servers in white shirts and vests.  So attentive, like we were royalty.  The food was a unique experience.  Delmonico steak with melted blue cheese, seafood stuffed veal (seafood was cooked separately prior to stuffing) were two delicious entrees.  So elegant with cloth tablecloths and napkins.  This was not just eating, this was an experience. Definite want to return."}
{"text":"I admit I was skeptical when this place first opened but I've been very impressed. Good sangria, modello on tap ( what a treat!) and genuinely enthusiastic service brought us back for drinks a few times. When we finally managed to make it in to eat at the bar, we were really impressed with the food. The grouper tacos and spicy potatoes were fabulous, and the Serrano ham fritters were such a delicious surprise. 

It does feel like the dining room is pretty formal, but we feel fine in casual clothing at the bar. Can't wait for the patio to open!"}
{"text":"Excellent! My boyfriend and I both got a seafood medley of some sort (it was the special) and it was soooo good! Antonio and his crew are truly first class professionals and we had 5 star service. There wasn't a minute without refills of our drinks or plates being cleared. It was a romantic and cozy atmosphere and great for a date night. I absolutely love the desserts too. I always get the crème brulee which is amazing and my boyfriend got a chocolate cake. I have been for the tapas before which are great and quite plentiful. It has a good bar too. A great place for a drink and appetizer (tapa) or two. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Went there last night and really enjoyed it. My husband is a seafood lover and he had many things to choose from. He got the seafood platter. He said the scallops were awesome but the lobster was a little dry. It did look dry. That is why four instead of five stars. I had the lightly breaded veal with mushrooms and a marsala  wine sauce and loved it. Flavors were well balanced. The wait staff was very attentive.  Not too stuffy, nice sense of humor. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Omg what a great meal and great service. The desserts and spanish coffee were over the top - awesome .  We drove an hour and 10 min to get here and would definitely come back. My only complaint is that the restaurant is not closer to our house."}
{"text":"Always an incredible meal, great service, and warm atmosphere. The staff seems to work well together to keep customers happy, and service going promptly. Marco is an awesome bartender! He is extremely attentive and friendly! I can't wait to dine again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here.  They really take care of you.  Excellent quality food and happy hour.  Kind of an older crowd but I hear Saturdays has younger people.  Great customer service.  Maybe I will go here tonight."}
{"text":"Started with stuffed peppers and took us back to our childhood favorite dishes..
Paella off the chain!!! 
Almond liquor shots delicious after the being stuffed to death.
We give it a thumbs up and the service was amazing. Will most assuredly come back with the rest of the family.  :)"}
{"text":"We went there about 2-3 weeks after opening so maybe they need some time to adjust. There were sooo many employees on the floor, looking confused, running into each other. They were all very nice but didn't seem to have been trained.

Their sangria was not good which was a bummer because they should be known for it. The tuna avocado tower was awesome. The shrimp ceviche was awful. The fish tacos were average.


I don't think we will try it again."}
{"text":"SO good. Service was awesome, extremely attentive, and the food was so fresh and well prepared.  Tried wine flights, salads, a few tapas, and their sea bass special.  Nothing but good things to say..."}
{"text":"I have eaten there 3 times and have been disappointed all three times in their food. The fish which they are noted for was dry and tasteless and coated in what looked and tasted like beef gravy from a diner. I would only go back to enjoy their great sangria but forget the food"}
{"text":"Great food excellent service great atmosphere the Tapas are the best the wine excellent and all the times I have been there I never had a bad experience I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I wanted to give 4 stars since the food was so great. The Caesar was fresh and crisp, the mussels perfectly prepared. But the ladies empowerment meeting with the female mayor of Elyria was more than I needed at lunch. Don't misunderstand me, I'm in full support of women, their rights and equality...but must I hear an unexpected empowerment speech while dining? Put them in a private room next time. Did I mention the food was great? It is."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible.  For the money,  the food was very, very good. Actually great!
 The staff was very attentive and very friendly.  There were five of us there, for the first time, and they treated us like family.  We will bring out of the state family to this place.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What a find! First of all the service was impeccable. Guermo (Bill) offered a great wine suggestion followed by some fantastic tapas. Great place for a date, work dinner or family. The tapas were really really good..artichokes, potatoes, calamari(sauce was amazing). Wonderful dining experience..beautiful patio.
Guermo and Tony both were so warm. From A-Z fantastic! We will be back often!! Desserts were dangerous and awesome coffee!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch...amazing service.  The red snapper special was worth coming out to lunch on a rainy day.  Try the goat too!  To die for.  Can't wait to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"My husband and I made a spur of the moment stop here for dinner and, boy, are we happy we did!  While we were underdressed for such a nice atmosphere, we were made to feel completely acceptable and welcome. The staff was so incredibly attentive, friendly and kind. We had the spicy potatoes, grouper tacos, chorizo with olives and vegetable paella. Everything was exceptionally good, especially the sangria!  Service could not have been better. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the drinks were amazing. I heard it's the best sangria around. We went for my sisters 21st it was great. They also have virgin sangria witch was great!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch with my wife, who is vegetarian. She had a delicious salad, I had the  fettuccini with chicken and pesto sauce. Also had the chicken noodle soup which was some of the best I have ever had. Very friendly Maitre d. Ate indoors but the patio looks lovely."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Sangria tonight and it was fantastic!  My husband had the Delmonico steak and I had the sea bass special.  Both were delicious and cooked perfectly.  Our kids had the Mac and cheese and loved it.  The service was attentive without being obtrusive.  We will definitely return to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've ever had in my  life. We went on Valentine's Day so it was very crowded but service was still outstanding. I had a fillet mignon which was cooked to perfection, buttery, and melted in my mouth. My partner had the daily special of lobster tails which was amazing. We tried three warm tapas: sautéed octopus, Spanish spicy potatoes, and sea scallops with braised beef short ribs.  They were all fanrastic. The food was super fresh and the presentation beautiful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not much to add to the other reviews. The meal, the ambiance, the service, all top notch. Go!"}
{"text":"Best Spanish food in Cleveland. 
All the menu is great, but I die for octopus and paella. 
Very nice service. 
And the sangria is really good."}
{"text":"Amazing service, fantastic sangria and out of this world crusty bread. We were there to see a musician and the place was packed but the service never faltered. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Long overdue review, went here on Father's Day for a meal with my family and had a very enjoyable time.  As a group, we ate \"family style\" sharing a bunch of appetizers and a pitcher of sangria.

The service was top notch and our server guided us through the menu to ensure we had a nice variety of dishes.  I had a bowl of delicious soup, then we all had samples from a charcuteries plate, sausages with briny green olives (went well together), a salad, stuffed mushroom caps, warm spinach dip with pita chips, oxtail and capped it all off with a creamy smooth flan.

It was great to be able to sample so many dishes, and the sangria was fresh and tart filled with fruit.  A great way to finish off a wonrdeful day together as a family."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Service is top notch (someone put my napkin on my lap for me) food is incredible and thoughtfully prepared. The atmosphere created by the staff is warm and inviting and we really enjoyed our experience.  Definitely a great place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went her for a birthday dinner off of a co-workers recommendation. We got the patatas bravas, camarones al ajillo, mushroom risotto and the fried calamari as well as a half pitcher of sangria and a flan for desert. The food was pretty good and the service was excellent. My least favorite was the flan, it was less creamy and more like a firm jello. The patatas bravas were interesting, they were nicely prepared potatoes tossed in this sauce that tasted like buffalo sauce mixed with mayonnaise. The mushroom risotto was surprisingly my favorite! The flavors were really developed in this dish and I couldn't get enough. Will revisit this place and try more small dishes!"}
{"text":"Wow. We just finished our evening at Sangria and Tapas and it is definitely a must-try and a will-go-back again. We had early reservations on a Saturday night. Although we arrived 20 minutes early, we were seated immediately. The dining room is relatively spacious, larger parties can be accommodated but this is a great place for smaller, more intimate parties and tapas are a tremendous way for 2-3 couples to spend a fun evening trying different tastes. The wine list was extensive and featured flights of wine grouped by country of origin and also a dessert flight of Ports. We plan to return with one or two other couples when the patio is open to try a flight or two and a lot of small plates.

The service was outstanding throughout our dinner. We ordered two tapas and two of the dinner specials, along with Sangria. Their house recipe sangria ($25 pitcher) was very good, not overly sweet nor overly fruity. It was easy to drink and was a very good accompaniment to the Croquetas San Miguel ($7), which were fritters stuffed with Serrano ham and a honey and cheese filling, and the Codorniz Asadas Relleno con Chorizo, delicious bacon-wrapped, chorizo stuffed roasted quail on toast ($10). The quail was served on a spectacular red wine reduction.  Our entrees were non-menu specials, a terrific grouper in a white wine sauce with prosciutto and mushrooms, and a seafood platter that featured steamed clams and mussels, a broiled lobster tail, langostinos and squid. ($32 and $33). The seafood came with drawn butter and there was a garlicky, delicious sauce that I assume was based on the steaming broth for the shellfish. A beautiful and delicious plate.  The entrees were brought with a side of Spanish rice, saffron scented, with peas and peppers, house-made potato chips and steamed broccoli and cauliflower. The meals were preceded by salads as well. The tray of desserts was fairly standard, we opted for flan and almond cake (both $6) and both were very good. The flan came with a brandied (or rum?) caramel sauce...yum!  Our waiter brought us each a complimentary almond flavored after dinner liqueur that was a nice way to end the evening.

Service was outstanding. Staff was present but never hovering, plates were cleared unobtrusively and quickly, food came out quickly and at the perfect temperature. We never felt hurried nor did we ever feel like we were waiting. This was the evening you dream about in terms of service in a restaurant and the front and back managers are obviously very good at what they do....and the cooking was fantastic. Total bill for two was $160; that's two tapas, two entree specials, a pitcher of Sangria and desserts, plus tax and tip. Money well spent for a flawlessly executed night out."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner Tapas means small dish I think we had samples of 6 different dishes all very good, desserts were even better"}
{"text":"Having recently completed a chorizo tour in Europe, I feel my standards are legit. The Chorizo here was  off the chart.  The Octopus was of similar quality as well as the Manchego.  The service had that old school professionalism, manners, and charm you don't find often anymore. Jam packed late on a Friday night, you can tell the locals value the place (rightfully) over the sterile corporate chains down the road that rely on architecture and alcohol to draw a crowd. My thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"As far as the food and service goes... This place has it all when it comes to a foodie!  Absolutely transports your taste buds to Spain with such an assortment of tapas it's hard to resist. Almond portugese liqueur and wonderful full bodied Chilean wine. Much love, be back very soon."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly impressed by this place! I love tapas and stopped here once for lunch and am hooked now. Great food!! The ahi tuna was very fresh tasting, the croquettes were delicious. Great wine selection that is reasonably priced. Cool atmosphere. The crazy part though is the service. They are right up there with Pier W, Blue Point for level of service. They blow a place like Adega away. Honestly, I think the best service I've ever had. Always someone there to fill your wine glass or water, get more bread, etc. great place for a date or a girls night. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! The food is always fresh & tastes wonderful.
Never eaten in, always ordered take-out, but it's VERY reasonably priced, and if you have any dietary restrictions, they take great care of you! Tony is always a gentleman as well. Highly recommend for all to try!
The Bassa is incredible, love the sautéed calamari & the Chips are delightful!"}
{"text":"This has become our \"go to\" place to bring out of towners and for date night. Nice decor without feeling stuff. AMAZING service. We recently took some people from NYC here and they said it was one of the best restaurants they'd been to in a while. I've yet to have a bad dish. We typically get a bunch of plates and share for the table. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and of course food.  Tapas are the best!  Service was great too.  Seafood tapas are outstanding."}
{"text":"Still great service and great food come see Marco at the bar! Happy Hour is a must 
Try the bacon wrapped quail it's delicious!"}
{"text":"We have dined here twice in the last few months and enjoyed both meals a lot. Both times we ate exclusively from the hot and cold tapas menus. Every dish we had was excellent. Their Patatas Bravas and Serrano ham Croquettes are the closest we found to the ones we has in Madrid. Great staff (who patiently answered the questions of our surrounding patrons - and they had A LOT), good drinks. A definite do again."}
{"text":"I have not been to many tapas bars but I must say, I was impressed with this place.  The outside decor is about 20 years outdated however, the food and service more than makes up for it.  We had sampled 8 tapas and 2 types of sangria... Excellent!  We did not have a bad dish.  I saw someone comment on the fish tacos before and I have to say, if you don't like corn tortillas, ask flour ones and them the fish tacos would be perfect.  I will definitely be visiting again in the near future and hope to get the same quality of food and service.

Note:  I would personally not recommend the patio, it has a great view of I-90 and is loud from the traffic of cars going by."}
{"text":"Went with a large party and they were very accommodating.  Should have had more than 1 server for 18 people as the night would have gone smoother.  The server was very nice but in over his head, did not know who had what so some people missed a few plates.  Nobody ever even saw the check as they just split it between cards, which nobody wanted but since dinner took so long we opted to just leave.  Good place but learn seat numbers and how to split a check properly, it would go a long way."}
{"text":"I eat out a lot as part of my job at very fancy places all over DC. It's getting harder and harder for me to be impressed. This place really impressed me. Amazing food. Everything is fresh and tasty. Don't miss the Octopus ! Best I ever had."}
{"text":"Five stars, and I'm a pretty tough grader. The food was excellent - I had the special shellfish platter, which was both delicious and generous. The service was attentive and the wait staff was friendly and actually fun. And the prices were quite reasonable. All in all the best dining experience in some time!"}
{"text":"Great and fun staff! Delicious food - seafood is amazing :) yummy drinks and desserts too!"}
{"text":"Un-freakin-believable!  I can't remember the last time I had a top to bottom fantastic dining experience.  For a girls night out on a Friday evening we met at the bar for their happy hour half priced tasty martinis.  We had both amazing bar service and the other patrons at the bar were amusingly entertaining.  
When it was time for dinner we were seated by a large picture window that overlooked the beautifully gardened patio (closed for being 50 degrees).  Here we had the most outstanding, personable, knowledgeable, and over all fun server for the evening.  For the table we shared a pitcher of red sangria and it was delicious.  We also shared four delightful appetizers: Croquetas san Miguel - lovey honey finish on a ham fritter, Patatas Bravas - wonderfully spicy potatoes, Camarones A La Cancun - shrimp (cocktail) on a spicy salsa, and Alcachofas Tiera Del Fuego - *best of the apps* artichoke breaded and fried then topped with balsamic vinegar.   
For dinner we got: The evening special of wild boar - fall off the bone tender with rice and vegetables, Pimentos Banana Rellenos - perfectly spiced banana peppers stuffed with Italian sausage, Vieras A Cebon - delightful scallops stuffed with short ribs, and Solomillo A La Strogonoff - crazy delicious filet with mushroom sauce.  And to finish the meal they treated us to  the traditional shot of Almond liqueur.
To repeat, un-freakin-believable!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight, splitting a pitcher of amazing red sangria. It was so fruity and light, and went down easy in a hot day. We split a few tapas- including a scallop and short rib on a crostini which was delicious and prepared perfectly. The fish taco was so fresh, and the slaw have it the right balance. The Spanish spicy potatoes was a nice siracha tasting heat. Finally, we had a cheese and fruit plate that I would not get again. It needed a crunch element, it was simply some cheese triangles and melons. The only reason I gave the review a 4 star was because the wait staff seemed to linger around our tables pretty consistently, they not only lingered by our tables but close to where we were was where they hang out when waiting- we felt a little crammed, and they were  a little overbearing.  Everything else, food and drink- was fantastic."}
{"text":"We showed up with a party of 12 unannouced and they quickly accommodated us. Menu not too busy amd staff very attentive. Allowed to move at our own pace, never rushed. Food was good, but definitely leans to spanish influence. A number of choices involved seafood, with a good amount of fish choices."}
{"text":"This restaurant is VERY NOISY!!!!! I know there was music there but you couldn't even hear yourself think or try to talk to someone across the table. Their food is fair again nothing that I would want to go & choose to eat at again everything is written in Spanish & luckily the waiter/host was there to help us out with the foods & I ordered the wrong thing I thought I was getting a decent size piece of short rib & here I ended up with a darn small piece not enough to fill the teaspoon of short rib. I couldn't understand what the person was saying because of the noisy music & everything else. I do not like a place like that where it is so noisy & that you can't even make a decent conversation to someone unless you are screaming on top of your lungs to them"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks about a week ago. Overall, was an okay experience but nothing special. The place was very packed and seemed to be a little chaotic. We ordered this garlic shrimp, Sangria, and Nachos a la tino. The shrimp did not seem fresh but the garlic sauce was good. The nachos were horrible, the cheese may have been cheese whiz and there's was no Serrano Ham like the menu said it had on it. However, the Sangria was very good!  

I'll wait a couple months but will try it again because the menu is huge and lots of other things I want to try."}
{"text":"What a treat to have a Tapas bar on the west side of Cleveland!! Very good, authentic selection of tapas. Very good, fresh entree selections. Good wine selection. Service was very attentive - almost to the point of annoying. Lovely atmosphere. We've never been disappointed with our selections. Can get expensive - so choose wisely if you're on a budget. We will definitely be going back to try more tapas!"}
{"text":"An other enjoyable and delicious lunch at Sangria y Tapas Monday afternoon. This is the place to go when you want something good to eat that is not the usual burger, wrap or taco. Shareable small plates of Tapas or main dishes with a selection that includes unique ingredients such as octopus, goat and lamb are the norm at this Westlake restaurant.

We started our lunch with some midday refreshments, wine for my wife and a Peroni on tap for yours truly. The hard part of our visit was deciding on what to have for lunch. Almost went for the goat, something you do not find servered in too many restaurants, but ordered the Paella while my wife went with the Lobster Ravioli. Lunch included a cup of soup or salad and we split the difference - I tried the soup du jour - a tomato, rice and potato combination that was very good while the healthy half of the team had the side salad.

I'm assuming my wife lobster ravioli was good, she did not offer any as a taste but had positive comments on how good the dish tasted. I enjoyed the Paella, nice amount of shell fish (shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels) chicken and a spicy sausage mixed within the rice. 
The shellfish were cooked right, not over done a rubbery but complete. The accompanying side of potato chips and mixed veggies served family style to the table were a nice compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this 4 stars because of the potential if they switch up a few things and because the food was good and the service was great.
We went on a Tuesday night and it was very quiet and not quite what we were expecting from a restaurant that is filling the old Cleats. It was very formal with linens and waiters in suits that served our individual plates when they brought them out. 
When I think tapas I envision something more casual. So my recommendations to the owners is expand the tapas part of the menu, drop the stuffy entrees, linens and suits and in general just relax. I think it definitely has potential for success in Westlake but just needs to take a big chill.
I heard the bar on Saturday nights is hopping and I hope they take advantage of the patio now that the weather is good again."}
{"text":"We went here Friday night and had the best seafood dinner! My husband had the seafood paella and I had the seafood stew. Both were so flavorful, also lots of food. The dinner came with side of rice, vegetables, and homemade potato chips. It ended with a shot of lovely liquor. Staff was attentive but not obtrusive. The owner was friendly and humble. Loved it and can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING PORTUGUESE & SPANISH RESTAURANT

My wife and I had an absolutely fabulous lunch here. We started by ordering a flight of wine and it turned out to be 4 full glasses of Spanish red. Yikes!

Then we shared 2 tapas items: the Chorizo a la Riojana and the Gambas al Ajillo (shrimps with garlic sauce). Both were outstanding.

After that we shared the Paella Valenciana, which proved to be a very large helping, certainly suitable for 2 people. It was exquisite.

Everything about this place was 5 stars. The service was impeccable.

You may consider this a rave review!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Excellent wine selection. Love the outdoor patio in the summer."}
{"text":"A great gem on the corner of a busy intersection. Great patio despite the roar of I90 traffic! The meals are served with sides family style and large portions of main choice...recommend any of the seafood dishes! The sopa de marisco is absolutely fantastic and I could eat it everyday. The restaurant is family run and service is perfect with attention to detail. The bar is staffed with friendly bartender who knows what you will order before you are ready. Come in anytime and the bar is full of regulars which makes for a fun night of socializing. Recommend dining in this wonderful restaurant in Westlake conveniently located on Detroit road close to the free way"}
{"text":"I have been to this place at least 4 times, and every time the food and service were great. Love the paella, a must try!"}
{"text":"A place where I can snack my way through dinner on appetizer style dishes? Yes please! The food was delicious and the service was excellent. We really enjoyed being able to try several different small plates and order as we ate while never feeling rushed. There were many different things to choose from both hot and cold. Our server recommended a pitcher of the house sangria so we ordered a half pitcher since I wouldn't consider myself a sangria person, but I really enjoyed it and wished we had ordered a full! Their outdoor patio is nice in the summer and indoors has a cozy romantic vibe. I would like to go back and try their full size entree options as every one we saw looked delicious, but I am not sure I could pass up the Tapas!"}
{"text":"Sangria was amazing!!! The service was exceptional and the food was top of the line! We have been to Spain and had tapas in Barcelona and this experience was definitely comparable. The staff is authentic and definitely waits on you hand and foot. The fried calamari was to die for and the ensalada de aguacate y pera (mixed greens tossed with avocado and pear in a creamy Parmesan dressing with toasted pine nuts) was delightful. We will definitely be back. 

FYI the tables have white linen cloth and is definitely more on the upscale side so keep this in mind when considering your dress code."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go!  Everyone is very friendly. Reminds me of Cheers. Food is absolutely amazing. I always have a great meal. If you sit at the bar you will be entertained by Marco, the bartender. He is adorable."}
{"text":"Holy sangria!!!! Super refreshing and delish. Go with the pitcher! Everyone is super nice here and the menu is HUGE! We ordered:

spinach dip (eh)
spicy potatoes(outstanding)
garlic shrimp (yes)
risotto (decent) 

I love the concept of ordering a number of small plates and sharing. There are honestly so many options and all seemed great. I would try other things upon returning but those spicy potatoes will always be a staple!!!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant with exceptional food and very personal service.  I eat here whenever I am in Cleveland.  The paella is my favorite, but I am looking forward to the rest of the menu.  And the sangria is a must."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.  Food was wonderful. Seafood soup (more of a bisque with a few whole pieces  of seafood) was great...nice flavor, not too creamy like some bisques. Grilled octopus was excellent, some of the most tender I have ever had. Will be back for this over and over. Everyone around at the bar was raving about anything  they had. Quality food, well seasoned, well prepared. Great bartender, super nice staff. If Cleveland  is known as a culinary  destination,  this restaurant needs to be in that conversation."}
{"text":"Didn't believe the reviews but went and was very surprised. Very good food and drinks. Owner met and talked with us. Will go back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE a good sangria, so when I saw the name of this place, I knew I HAD to stop by. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed to find that despite being named after my favorite drink, the sangrias here did not live up to my expectations. The atmosphere is interesting though, and felt as though we had walked onto a Hispanic movie set. However, neither the food nor drinks lived up to my expectations, which was rather upsetting."}
{"text":"Love this place, they know a little some thing about customer service, went there on a Friday and was completely satisfied and the bartender Marco is so cool and fun."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Sangria is great. Tapas are delicious. And the staff is great. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place randomly on my lunch break, and now I go back at least once a week! Everything about this restaurant impresses me, and it's my new favorite place to eat!

The atmosphere is cute and cozy, and they have a great patio. I, however, always sit at the bar, and Marco (the bartender) is awesome! He's friendly, funny, attentive, and makes an awesome margarita! His service alone makes the place, but the food is spot on. 

The menu is extensive. I always have a hard time deciding on what to order. My favorites so far are the beef carpaccio, the filet stroganoff, and the side order of rice. But seriously, it's ALL amazing. From the soups, to the salads to the entrees, to even the sides. I've never been disappointed with anything here. 

For being a tapas place, the sizes of the dishes are decently sized and I always leave full. 

Love this place. Def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I come here with my dad when I'm in town visiting. This is his favorite restaurant. I've had a couple of the tapas. We mostly sit at the bar. I think this is his place to escape and relax. Everyone here knows his name, seriously. 

Last time I was in town, I drove him here and he introduced me to the owner who bought my drinks. The service here is excellent regardless. I've observed how friendly the staff are to patrons. And wow does it smell good in here. I even brought my son here once. I was impressed that they had a tapas on the menu that the incredible Mr. Picky actually ate. He enjoyed sitting at the bar and rearranging things. The employees were good sports. 

There's plenty of parking due its proximity to the nearby Drug Mart. There's also quite a bit of seating inside, I've only been here during happy hour, but it looks like they can easily accommodate large parties."}
{"text":"Just ok.  The food was good, but I didn't have anything that was overly impressive. The white sangria was good. I was not a fan of the service. There were 3 of us. We ordered a cold cheese plate & 5 tapas to share. The cheese plate & all of the tapas came out together. We were each given 1 small appetizer plate & the waiter disappeared. The table was small & I ended up putting the bread plates & empty bread baskets on the extra chair to make room for the food. No one offered to take them.  At any other Tapas restaurant I have been to cheese & cold plates come out 1st, followed by salads, and then hot food, so the hot food does not get cold. Typically additional plates are provided as well so that sauces aren't mixed. The shot of almond liquor at the end was nice.  Overall it wasn't awful, but not worthy the $140 bill."}
{"text":"Wow...I am really surprised by how many good reviews this place has gotten.  I have been there three times (yes, I'm a glutton for punishment) and have never been that impressed.  Firstly, the wine by the glass program is WAY overpriced...at least 2 bucks more than what they should be charging...particularly since the pours are sooo chintzy.  Bartenders are very nice though.  The ambience is nice.  It kind of reminds me of my grandparents living room, which I like.  It's much different than how it looked when it was Cleats.  Although the sauce that the mussels sat in was tasty, the mussels were awful.  The chef should not have ever served them.  The calamari was not fresh...pre breaded and frozen. The meat and cheese board was fine...but included 3 salamis.  It could have used some more variety.  I am looking forward to sitting on the patio this summer and giving it another try...maybe octopus next time."}
{"text":"We had dinner on April 27th. Two of our party self-identified with the waiter as needing gluten- free treatment. We ordered small plates: Roasted Grape Salad, Stuffed Banana Peppers, Fish Tacos, Spanish Spicy Potatoes, Gazpacho, Grilled Vegetables and Stuffed Quail. The food was DELICIOUS! However our waiter did not attend adequately to our need for gluten-free selections. The Stuffed Banana Peppers were initially presented with toast on the plate. The Fish Tacos were originally prepared/presented in flour tortillas. The Stuffed Quail was presented on top of toast slices. In each case we provided feedback to our waiter. Even after receiving feedback on the Stuffed Banana Peppers and the Fish Tacos he STILL did not ensure proper treatment of subsequent order of Stuffed Quail."}
{"text":"Went for an office dinner as a group of 10. Excellent service. Very attentive. Everyone loved their food. Regular dinners not a huge amount of food but all very good. 
Most of us has seafood and loved it."}
{"text":"My two friends & I went here to celebrate a birthday.  It was the first time for all 3 of us.  We decided to share a pitcher of sangria & a variety of  different tapas.  Everything was delicious and beautifully served.  I liked the white sangria we choose but my one friend found it too sweet.  However, she remedied it with adding a little pinot grigio that our waiter quickly brought to our table.  Some of the tapas we shared were the chicken shish kabob, Spanish omelet, sausage stuffed banana peppers, spicy potatoes, and toast points with caramelized onions, goat cheese & arugula.  Long story short, there was nothing left.  Everything was really flavorful and delicious.  The wait staff was attentive and accommodating.  They even brought out a serving of Spanish flan with a lit birthday candle in it so we can continue the celebration of our friend's special day.  I plan to return to work my way through many more of the offering of tapas and full size dinners available.  Please note that they offer a lot of seafood dishes but an allergy of one of our diners prevented us from sampling any at this visit."}
{"text":"Let's say we will go back. We tried a number of things some great, some okay and some we will pass on.  Started with black bean soup.  I'll pass on it next time. I don't remember the beer name but it was the only Spanish beer they had. It was good. Here is what I enjoyed, the octopus with olive oil and blue cheese. Loved it! The scallops with short ribs was also very good. The spicy Spanish potatoes were also very good, plus the mushroom filet. We will not order the quail again. Service was great."}
{"text":"Excellent Happy hour.  Calamari fried or sautéed was tender and lightly dusted-better than in many Italian restaurants.  Ambiance very pleasant for the discerning."}
{"text":"We previously loved this place for authentic Spanish tapas. We went tonight for dinner and were very disappointed.  The seafood and chicken in the paella was overcooked to the point it was all dry or rubbery and the rice was blah.  The seafood platter special had a strange taste and the homemade chips were soggy.  I'm sorry I ever suggested this place to friends. Also we ordered sangria that never came and they appear not to be doing the after dinner shots of liquor."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Scallop and rib was best tapa! Fish taco was great - really clean (must've gotten better, because I saw a bad yelp review for it).

Service was super nice, wifi worked well too!

{"text":"My wife and two elementary school boys went on a Monday for our wedding anniversary. Sangria was marvelous. She and older son opted for a selection of Tapas while the younger and I split the GIANT seafood platter. The wait staff was very attentive and thoughtful. We never had to think about asking for a refill or fresh plate. 
Each element was expertly prepared. Our favorites: ham and cheese croquettes, chorizo (the one with raisins and spinach is a real palette pleaser!), and calamari (no rubber bands here!).  My youngest now has a taste for octopus and mussels!
We were having such a delightful time we got a few more Tapas (quail wrapped in bacon, scallops stuffed with braised short rib, and more chorizos).
As we settled down, they brought out the desserts. Creme brûlée, flan and I had the cappuccino cake. Did I mention REAL espresso! 
I can't say enough about the service and professionalism. No wait for the check and out the door in about an hour and a half total."}
{"text":"I pass this restaurant every day and finally decided to give it a try with a friend. We walked in around 8:00 on a Saturday and were seated right away. It was crowded, but we still were met with great service. Being our first time here my friend and I decided to split 4 tapas items and got a dessert to split. We were stuffed! We also ordered the red sangria (it's in the name) and this was also excellent. I've heard they have a great happy hour and patio in the summer so I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I almost hate to post this as the bar is busy enough already but we love going to Sangrias during happy hour and experiencing great service, well-done drinks and delicious small plate options!"}
{"text":"This place has great sangria and the food on a whole is really good. But the price is kind of high for how little food you get."}
{"text":"I was looking of a place to go for my birthday and a co worker of mine suggested I check this place out. I'm a big fan of tapas, Spanish food and Sangria so i figured why not. This place looks a tad bit dated on the outside and inside for that matter ,but don't let that discourage you. The service was incredible and the selection of food to choose from is extremely varied. You can select from a list of cold or hot tapas. (I suggest you order a few different ones for the table and share them around the table. The fried calamari and spicy potatoes were my favorite tapas dishes. Followed very closely by the mushroom risotto. The Flan wasn't the best but since it was my birthday and I got it on the house, I couldn't complain. Lastly the Sangria wasn't. Ad as well. SeemedThis place gets my recommendation."}
{"text":"As usual, I sat at the bar. My bartender was busy, but attentive. A very friendly guy who was good at his job. My receipt said \"guy\" but who knows if that was actually his name.

The decor was dark but not pretentious. Lovely bar area. Nice dining area. Clients were definitely on the older side... being 28, I brought the average age down to about 61 from 61.2. That is to say it was crowded. With old people. They were nice.

Anyway, the drinks were small, but well made. My mojito was especially refreshing, and the mint essence hung around the bar for awhile.

As for the food, it was excellent. Well-plated, served all at once, hot, and frickin' delicious. I had the grilled octopus with a bleu (cabrela?) cheese, olive oil, and oregano. It was tender on the inside, crunchy and brown on the outside, served on small toast. It was delicious. Next I had the crab cakes, which were the best I've ever had outside of the DC/MD area. They weren't super crabby, they were perfectly cooked, and served with a sweet sauce dripped over them. Super good. Last I had the bacon-\"rapped\" quail, which was a little bit dry, but tasted wonderful. Crispy and delicious finger food.

I also had the almond cake which was fluffy and delicious, but not nearly as noteworthy as the rest of dinner. Guy finished my meal with a Portuguese almond liquor, on the house. It was incredibly sweet, but complimented the almond cake which was still fresh on my palate.

All in all, this place is awesome. Good food, huge menu, great service. They even had this Portuguese sausage they served a few people in the dining room that comes out ON FIRE. Not many other classy places serve FLAMING MEAT.

If you're in Cleveland west, go here. 4.8/5."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Authentic Portuguese and Spanish food! They have spicy potatoes that are amazing! Their specials are fantastic and the service is excellent!! Each entree is accompanied with a delicious salad or choice of soup (and their soups are to live for:) At the end of your meal, they give you an almond liquor to cleanse your palate, which is awesome! If you have yet to try this place, it's a must! So glad this place is one the west side!!"}
{"text":"I chose to give them four stars because the staff here are very personable and helpful. The tapas that my boyfriend and I ordered were outstanding! Their scallops are to die for. 

However, their octopus tapas that we ordered was gross to say the least. It was still a quality octopus that was served to us though - which is reason for the 4 stars. 

Also, I found a tiny hair in my food - I removed it and ate around the area. It was gross but I didn't make a big deal about out. We told our waiter and he apologized repeatedly. The manager offered free desserts (which we declined), so he offered us 2 shots on the house. That we accepted :) 

Overall an awesome restaurant, although pricey! Our lunch came out to be $60!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!  Food was spot on, service was outstanding!  All foodies must try this gem!"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place and have wanted to try it for awhile, so finally made the plunge last night.  I'm very glad that I did!  Up front I'll say it's a fairly pricey place, but for the service and good quality food it pretty much wasn't unexpected.  So the price isn't really playing into my rating one way or another.  

My date and I were the only non-bar customers in there, so we had about the best waiter service one could ask for.  For an appetizer we had the Gazpacho, and this was surprisingly off to just an average start.  My culinary skills aren't that great, but I make a decent Gazpacho, one better than this one.  While it wasn't bad, it wasn't magical either.  But that changed when our meals came...

We were in a sea-food kinda mood, so we ordered the crab-stuffed salmon and the lemon-butter with spinach sea bass nightly special.  Both were simply superb, soft, tasty and cooked just right.  The side dishes of rice and broccoli hit the spot and complimented the meals quite well... in addition to the surprising but still good light potato chips!  

We declined dessert and had leftovers with all the food, and the manager brought us two shots of port wine on the house to round off our meal.  

All around a good meal for sure, and if the opportunity arises, I will be back.  And next time will maybe try some actual Sangria y tapas!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Way way way over priced. Felt rushed at times and the place was empty so its not like they needed the table. Food was good, not great but not worth the price"}
{"text":"Nice environment and excellent service. Food is very authentic. Great environment for a date. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Exceptional good service, food was excellent, but you should be a seafood lover. I had paella, which was great, would feed two! My spouse does not eat seafood, he had steak. It was cooked to perfection with a delicious pepper/cognac sauce. A little on the higher price scale, but very well worth it."}
{"text":"Went last night with a friend to happy hour.  The staff was very attentive. The happy hour selections were good. I ordered sangria and bruschetta. Both of which, I would enjoy having again.  Will return with hubby for dinner next time."}
{"text":"The last time I had paella was a couple years ago at a Sunday market in London. There was a vendor cooking paella with open fire on the street, using the specialized shallow pan. Ever since then I have not been able to find paella in restaurants in CLE. Until now. As far as I know there is only another restaurant Mallorca that serves paella. it is located downtown with painful parking situation.

We came during lunch time. Here's what we ordered:

- Tapa: shrimps in garlic sauce: flavorful! Will order again. 

When we finished the shrimps (but with ample sauce left), the wait staff came to take away the empty plate; I looked at him longingly for 2 seconds, because in my mind I was planning \"when they refill the bread basket, I'm going to clean the sauce with the bread; but now this over-helpful dude takes away my sauce!\"

Good thing I didn't have to cry over lost sauce for too long, because my paella of heaven arrives!

- Paella: I dare say it is better than my \"London-Street-Vendor Paella\"! The short grain rice saturated in just right amount of seafood-saffron gravy. Not greasy. Not too salty. I have no word. It was perfect. The portion is big for lunch. I couldn't finish in one sitting (plus I had the tapa and bread).

I wonder how big it'd be for dinner, costing $26.

- Flan: It is firm, smooth, with a hint of anise and rum. It is great. Will order again. But I prefer the flan at El Arepazo Y Pupuseria in Fairview Park. The consistency of these two are very similar, but flavor at El Arepazo's is more classy, without anise. I'm a classy kind of gal.

- Mariscada on green sauce: I only had one spoon to taste, but my dining buddy, who claimed to be already full, couldn't stop eating it, so eventually overstuff herself and finished all of it. Her comment: \"Seafood is very fresh. It is very very good\".

- Veal Marsala wine sauce
Dining buddy said it was good, but he will order my paella next time instead. And he hates seafood!

With our orders come with a plate of saffron rice, green steamed garlicky vegetable and chips. With lots of food, we walked away happy. Worth 40 min drive to get here."}
{"text":"Tapas is the only way to go here! Small plates are the best and entrees are good not great! And yes the Sangria is a must! That is worth going to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is based on their takeout service. I ordered over phone for paella and roasted quail. I ordered the paella with only shrimp and lobster tail and to replace all the remaining seafood with that. However, when I opened the takeout box at home, I found that it was not customized as requested. Its the original plate of paella with all the seafoods on it. Since the plate looked good and I could anyways eat it; so instead of calling and letting them know I just decided to eat it. But yes my request was not fulfilled.

As many have reviewed, food here is very good. Their one order of paella is pretty large; two light eaters can share. Paella comes with salad/soup, side vegetables and potato chips. Their paella is very flavorful with a nice rich blend of clams, shrimps, lobster tails, chicken, etc. I also liked their bacon wrapped roasted quail. Roasted quail has a slight tinge of sweetness. Even though I don't like my meat sweet yet I liked this dish for its crispness and its well cooked.
They are good at time estimation. For not listening to my request I'd have given it a 2; however food here is good and believing that it was just a one time mistake, I'd give them a 4."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times since it has opened, and I have never been disappointed.  It is truly one of the least talked about, hidden gems in an area filled with so many trendy/chain establishments.  I am unclear on the ownership, though I tend to believe it may be in some relationship linked to the original Viva Barcelona and Mallorca.  I say this because many of the entrees are similar, and much like the before mentioned, the service is consistently 5 Star. They not only have wonderful seafood and other Spanish specialties, but their prime rib, filets and lamb is fabulous. ( I do not eat meat, so this is per my boyfriend) if you're ever in the Westlake area, and you find yourself not knowing where to go for dinner, and heading up to Crocker makes you cringe, try this place!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot,I live just down the street.
Everything on the menu is well prepared from the octopus to the braised short ribs.There are so many different types of food and cooking styles on the menu and all are executed amazingly well.
Tapas at the bar is a great way to try the place out,they have a nice happy hour.
Staff is beyond professional,friendly and helpful.

Oh and get the almond cake for dessert,it's one of a kind and the best!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend this restaurant.  We had ordered a delmonico and tasted like it was boiled, not seared like a steak should be.with what barely resembled blue cheese on top.  Also ordered a seafood dish which was not cooked well either."}
{"text":"My mom suggested I try this restaurant during my visit home. So, my parents and I came here for tapas for dinner. They definitely draw a crowd and the atmosphere was very lively including music from a talented musician.

I started with the signature sangria which was pretty good. For our meal we shared deviled eggs with ham, fried artichokes, chicken skewer, stuffed peppers, shrimp, and the cheese and meat plate. Every item had lots of flavor and was served at perfect temperatures as they were ready instead all at once. We could have probably gotten away with five tapas for three people as we had to take one to go because we were too full.

The deviled eggs- were tasty and the ham added a nice saltiness. 

The fried artichokes were good, but the bed of greens underneath with the walnut dressing was even better. 

The chicken skewer was flavorful and included a nice variety of vegetables in addition to the chicken.

The stuffed peppers were generously stuffed with the sausage on tender peppers and nicely layered with a delicious sauce. 

The shrimp was lightly marinated with garlic. It was good, but not the most exciting of the options. 

The cheese and meat plate was much larger than I expected. Every meat and cheese was delicious. I used the bread from the other dishes to enjoy this. 

We ended the meal with the almond cake which reminded me of an almond tiramisu. It wasn't lacking in yummy almond flavor and was very moist with the perfect amount of caramel drizzle and whipped cream on top. The waiter also brought out shot glasses with a really nice tasting drink for each of us which I think was a dessert wine. It was a nice finishing touch to the meal. I'd definitely recommend this place for a fun dinner out."}
{"text":"Wow, a great tapas place on the west side.
Good news is that if the weather is nice (like it is today) they have a really beautiful patio out back-- bad news is that they are only a hundred feet from the highway, so there is a lot of traffic noise. Ah, well, nothing's perfect.
This place is great for tapas (and I love good tapas) but I should point out that if you're not into small dishes, they do also have full size entrees, and don't forget to ask about the specials. If you're a seafood lover, this place is heaven, but even a landlubber like me can find some great tapas here.
Portions are quite big for tapas (which by tradition should be plates so small they fit atop your wine glass) but you'll still want to order several plates.
Deserts are typical Spanish, such as flan."}
{"text":"Ambiance is awesome the food is excellent and the employees are polite with great service. The 2 owners are the perfect Chiefs I would refer my family and friends and to anyone. This is the perfect place."}
{"text":"This place is right in my neck of the woods and I never thought to try it until a friend suggested it. I guess I'd associated the location with its past lives as a pizzeria and then a sports bar and not thought much about the potential of tapas next door to Drug Mart, but now I feel foolish for my location snobbery. Three of us had nine different dishes of mostly seafood, and they ranged from good to great. The menu has dozens of tapas options and a handful of entrees, and a nice range of prices. We also enjoyed some sangria and very attentive service on a slow night. I'll be back for more well-prepared seafood served in sharable smaller sizes. It's really good."}
{"text":"Went in with some apprehension due to the limited reviews. Left with an appreciation for the paella, bouillabaisse, lamb and prime rib special. The grilled octopus was done with perfection, tender and crispy--this alone will bring us back. The kitchen went out of its way to satisfy our prime rib orders to obtain baked potatoes not on the menu. The 1 1/2 inch cuts were done to order and flavorful. Having vacationed in Spain the flavors were right on, the saffron rice standing out. I enjoyed the portugese clam appetizer as well. The sangria suit my taste to a T. The service was attentive and considerate. Our table of six agreed to return to further sample the menu."}
{"text":"Cute place with generally good, if brusque, service. We have only been there once, so take this review as a point in time. The four of us had assorted tapas and the daily special seafood platter. The tapas were a bit pricey and generally Ok, but not very refined for the price point. I can get similar items like beef carpaccio as an appetizer at some chain restaurants (i.e. Brio) for a similar price and receive more food and far better presentation.

We got the seafood platter largely because they said it included a lobster tail, which is technically correct but it was not a Maine lobster tail, it was an overcooked half of a little rock lobster tail. The mussels were tried three times and all were bad; nothing like a bad mussel to ruin your tastebuds for a bit. The shrimp were all overcooked. The scallops were well done. We finished with the Spanish Coffee, a tasty drink with a fun table-side preparation, the creme brûlée, which was denser than the French version, and the tiramisu.  I love independent restaurants, but this one was expensive and just Ok."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in westlake hands down!!! The service is top notch and the food is amazing. They have a huge selection of cold and hot tapas and a good selection of regular dinners on top of that. Desserts are great and my personal fav is the dessert coffee which they make in front of you and light on fire!! It smells wonderful and instantly reminds me of winter. At the end of the meal they bring us each a little shot of port or sherry which is a little thing but makes us feel special like family or regulars. Some nights they even have a cute old man playing guitar. I absolutely love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great tapas place with the freshest sangria you'll find in town. The grilled octopus is a must try! Service is amazing with knowledgable wait staff. The patio is facing a major highway with a lot of traffic so ideally inside is better than outside."}
{"text":"Nice place and very friendly service! The paella is pretty good and just similar with what I have eaten in Spain!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for couples and singles. Extremely attentive staff. Atmosphere is super cozy, you can relax enjoy martinis while listening to Mediterranean music. Martinis made by Marco are exceptional and the food offers world tastes beyond your chain establishment and same old same old. Compliments to the chef and Marco for making my night exceptional in the Cleveland area. Bravo"}
{"text":"Nice venue! Very pleasant staff however the food was almost uneatable & not authentic in the least. Now 9 hours after eating 4 \"chips\" I'm still trying to digest them. They tasted like they were fried in motor oil. 

Also we were served a small dish of \"Olive\" oil w garlic & cheese & what ever the oil was , it most assuredly wasn't 1st or 2nd pressing of olive! It may have been something called olive oil pumace which I used to see in a Greek grocery store in Skokie, IL, that sold for 1/2 of what real olive sold for but can't say for sure because I never had the nerve to buy it to try it. All I can think of that it must have been bad because it was so cheap!

I had the seafood stew that came w 2 scampi, 5 mussels, 5 baby clams & a baby lobster tail. Out of the 5 small mussels, 3 were empty shells & the lobster was tasteless!

She had the Paella which really wasn't, as the rice was done w curry powder & Not Saffron!

Can't believe so many people give this place 5 stars but I guess most have never traveled to Portugal or Spain or even to Newark, NJ that has a tons of famous Spanish & Portuguese, quality restaurants??"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for my birthday with my family and friends. The paella is great and the seafood is fresh, juicy and perfect cooked. The service is prompt. One of yesterday's special is seafood plaza we ordered. Aw man, it's huge. I suggest to share together. I'd like to have dinner again."}
{"text":"Wow food was simply amazing! And the service superb!! Definitely coming back to try other items on their menu:)"}
{"text":"We went to \"happy hour \" not quite what we expected or seen on TV. But great service in bar. Calamari was good. Other 2 appetizers  not so great.... Pretty in main dinning room. A little run down outside and in bar. I would not drive 35min to go again."}
{"text":"Can't believe we haven't tried this place earlier. First off, the service was great; from the hostess to the waiter and everyone in between - they were all very attentive. Enjoyed the wine flight and all our food was great - seafood medley and the clams and broth were fantastic. Lots of flavor and spice - delicious! Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my friend for dinner and we loved it!  We split a bunch of the small hot plates (tapas) and one cold plate.  Sorry, I can't remember the names of what we had but EVERYTHING was delicious!  One plate had short ribs on top of scallops and they were incredible.  I could have eaten 10 more plates of them!  We wanted to get a real feel for what the food was like so we decided to split a bunch of small things and I do recommend that for your first time there simply because there is so much good stuff there to eat!  They did have seafood specials that night that sounded amazing but we already decided to do the small plates.  It worked out well for us because all the plates came with portions of either 2's or 4's so it was easy to split.  We finished the night with the flan dessert and it was also fabulous!  We each had a glass of the red sangria and it was superb!  I'm not a huge sangria person but I figured when in Rome.. (or Spain, in this case) but I really enjoyed it.  Next time I think I'd go with some wine from Spain (they have an excellent wine selection) but I wouldn't turn down a glass of their sangria, either.  Service was excellent.  Our waiter was attentive but didn't hover. He didn't mind that we were not in a hurry and just let us keep ordering things as we went.  He gave us a complimentary shot of some liquor that had an almond taste and was delicious!  All the staff seemed to be so friendly. They all said hello and chatted with the guests.  We peeked outside at their patio and it's so pretty - it has a pond with a cascading waterfall.  We both decided we'll be back when the weather is warmer to try out the patio."}
{"text":"No such thing as mediocre food or lousy service at Sangria y Tapas!   This place is awesome in every respect.  The menu selection is beyond compare.  Come and discover for yourself.  I guarantee your satisfaction!"}
{"text":"Quaint place, limited parking. Upon entry, it was a crowed area, no biggie. We were seated immediately by a very nice hostess.

The waiter, um, well, confused is all I can say. He must have been nervous or perhaps, overwhelmed. Another gentleman came over and took our cocktail order and the original waiter came back and ask for our cocktail order, communication fail. Whatever. It's just a drink. 
Being that it was our first time, we wanted to view the menu and felt very rushed to make a decision. Kind of as though they wanted to turn over the table quick. 
If I am paying 20 some bucks for an entree, I can take my time making the right option. Don't rush your customers!
The calamari was AMAZING!!!
The Sangria was subpar (was there alcohol in it)?
The strip steak was the 2nd best steak I've ever had. Wow! Made to perfection. A bit over priced for things in our opinion, but nonetheless, worth it. 
Hope to go back and not feel as rushed by the staff!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend; service & food were AMAZING!! Some of the best tapas we've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"The family was in Cleveland for a wedding and we were looking for a place to gather Saturday night. We originally reserved the patio but it turned out to be a windy rainy night. It was a very busy evening but Tony and the crew set up tables so that all 14 of us could be seated together. It was a great menu that offered many different items for different tastes. The cuisine was outstanding, some of the best tapas plates I've experienced in Los Angeles or Spain, for that matter. You can order a full entree plate of something but the tapas were so good. Service was excellent, even as busy as it was. We were all impressed and highly recommend this great find."}
{"text":"Went to this place because of all the great reviews.  I should have walked out. There on a Saturday at 3pm we were the only people there. The bread was stale. I ordered seafood and chicken with rice. The chicken was rough I split it out. And the seafood was over cooked! The service was great but we were the only ones there. I can't believe this place got so many 4 stars. Never going back."}
{"text":"A night that happens to start off as just exchanging and returning xmas presents turned into one of the most wonderful meals we have ever had. A typical disagreement on where to eat and what to have was going on when nothing seemed to sound good. Eventually as we were reaching 90 to go home I remembered seeing a restaurant that was called sangria. We both were like okay let's just go with that. 

Upon entering the restaurant it takes you to the bar area. We are bar people and we were tempted to sit in the bar but decided to ask for a table in the restaurant instead. We were sat at a 2 top. The table had white linen table cloth and was set for 2 with folded napkins and water glasses. Instantly a server came over and poured us Waters. We both looked at each other and was like - this is fancy. We weren't expecting this at all. 

We decided to order the small pitcher of sangria to start and we were served warm Italian bread with olive oil. We were quite thirsty and our water glasses or sangria for that matter were never empty and always replenished. This instantly made me impressed as wonderful service. 

We ordered 5 tapas entrees to try: mussels in marinara, spicy potatoes, fried artichokes, chicken skewer and short rib over Asian noodles. The
Mussels were some of the best that my boyfriend ever had.. I tried the marinara with bread and holy shit was it good. The short ribs were tender, tasteful and delicious.. literally melt in your mouth.. and the Asian noodles were long and addictive. I really enjoyed the fried artichokes as a palette cleanser in between bites of other food. It had a simple fried crust drizzled with balsamic. The chicken skewer was juicy as well. Now the dish that we couldn't stop eating was the spicy potato's. So easy and simple.. yet so damn good. You need to get those.

We saw a table next to us get some dessert and decided to not eat everything as hard as it was and to box it up so we can share a dessert. We got the triple chocolate and of course ordered a Spanish coffee. The table side presentation of the coffee was impressive, fun and blows an regular Irish coffee out of the water. 

Overall we have put this establishment in our top 5 and can't wait to bring family and friends here to have fun and try new things. Even though the restaurant looks fancy the servers are all down to earth and really want you to enjoy yourselves. This is By far the best service we have ever received. Bravo Sangria Y Tapas."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to check it out, so glad we finally did. Service is excellent, as you would expect in a fine Spanish restaurant. Food was amazing. Grilled octopus one if my all time favorite dishes. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Stopped in at this place on a Friday night with a girl friend. We called ahead to make reservations for 7:30 PM because we didn't know how busy they would be. When we walked in, we noticed the bar was full but there were only a few taken tables. So reservations may not be necessary. 

Our server was nice, he joked around with us and was in high spirits. The feel inside is a little old, I prefer more modern places but this place was ok as far as decor, but it could use some help. 

We ordered the spinach dip which was good, there were only 6 little triangles of pita bread and the rest where tortilla chips. I ordered the roasted grape salad which was different. It all tasted good together but the grapes were pickled not roasted. Also, there were onions on the salad which wasn't listed as an ingredient.

Overall, it was ok. I would return for their happy hour which is Monday-Friday from 5-7 at the bar, but I don't know if I would return for dinner."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good. Service was great- knowledgeable and quick. The sangria was outstanding.

The bad: My husband ordered the chorizo with olive plate. They used those canned black olives. Ew. I ordered sausage in banana peppers, which was fine. Nothing special, but fine.

I would go back for the sangria, but not the food."}
{"text":"Sangria ended up being a pleasant surprise. We stopped here for dinner and enjoyed a delightful meal.

We had the roasted grape salad. This was delicious but also super pungent. Loved the concept and ingredients- but maybe it was over dressed? It was definitely unique and I feel like I would order again to give it another try. 

We had the croquetas- nice touch with honey sauce. 

We also enjoyed the short rib with Asian noodles- this was good but not amazing. A bit pricey for the portion.

The highlight of the meal was the paella. This was a huge portion! Beautiful presentation. It came with soup, which was a nice chicken noodle. I commented that it was the soup you crave when you want good chicken noodle soup that isn't too heavy with ingredients. Went down smooth and very flavorful. 
Paella was full of meat and seafood and very balanced in flavor. 
We then shared the almond cake- wow- this was also a real winner. Made in house- treat yourself to this delicious cake! 

The waitstaff was very attentive and professional and we both felt like it made the dinner feel formal is a good way. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Sangria with the wife last weekend.  We weren't sure what we would find, but we saw that it got solid ratings on yelp. Once we arrived and looked at the menu, it became apparent that this is a Spanish restaurant, like Mallorca in Cleveland, only better.

We were immediately seated and water was poured. Then our server told us about many daily specials. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria, ceviche, and croquetas San Miguel. The Sangria and ceviche were very good, but the croquetas were the best we've ever had. They had ham and other sweet flavors. They were just awesome!

For dinner, I went with one of the daily specials - stuffed rainbow trout. My wife opted for stuffed chicken. Little did we know that salad was included with our dinners. It was a fresh and tasty salad and mine disappeared quickly. When our dinners were served, they were accompanied by rice, buttered vegetables, and fresh potato chips. The sides were very tasty, indeed. I found my fish, while fresh, kind of flavorless. The stuffing was pretty good, but I did not enjoy the dish that much. My wife's stuffed chicken tasted much better.

After our plates were collected, they brought a tray of deserts and plopped them on our table so we could see what the options were. They all looked good, but the meal was so plentiful that our bellies were already bursting. However, we did have room for the sweet liquor with lime and ice that they provide at the end of the meal.

Overall, the meal was of good quality, the service was excellent, and the ambience was romantic and quiet. We will return as this will be our go to Spanish restaurant, since we will no longer be frequenting Mallorca downtown. With drinks and tip, our bill came to $120."}
{"text":"Decided to drive down Detroit in search of something new to try.. So glad we turned around for lunch at this spot! Right when we walked through the door, we were greeted warmly. We were seated at a table with a lovely view of the patio lined with flowers and trees. Water came right away followed by our drink orders. The first two pages of the menu are filled with soups, salads, and cold and hot tapas!  My mom and I love to try as many dishes as we can, so we shared three hot tapas - very hard to narrow down! We chose the mussels, crab cakes, and Spanish omelet. The mussels were in the best red sauce we've ever had! They crab cakes were cooked to perfection with a drizzle of a blood orange honey sauce! The Spanish omelet is light and fluffy and tastes awesome with some of our mussel sauce :) My dad raved about the grouper tacos and enjoyed his coffee.  Our water and drink glasses were never empty. The owner is wonderful and very personable. The happy hour menu looks fantastic, with many tapas being between $3-5 and select half-price Martinis (originally $10-11) and $1 off beers on Monday-Friday 3-7PM. I cannot wait to go back and try more tapas!! Especially for happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Service is good, bread and oil are good unfortunately had one tapa and that was enough. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but ahi tuna is pretty standard and theirs left myself and who I was with sick to our stomachs. Not sure if it was old or sat out but after that we choose to not order anything else. Maybe it was just a bad experience because everyone seems to love this place but for me it was bad enough that I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is very good. I love the rice that comes with entrees. I've had a variety of plates here and they are all very good. I think my favorite tapa is the grouper tacos."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The paella Valencia was unbelievable! Lobster, scallops, shrimp, mussels, clams, chicken, and sausage with saffron rice. Comes with steamed broccoli and cauliflower."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very attentive service. This place is a treasure.  Ahi tuna with avocado and tomato, shrimp with garlic sauce, scallops with short ribs, grouper tacos and sangria style chicken wings.  All were perfect.  They serve you an after dinner shot of chilled Spanish Amaretto to top off an excellent meal.  Definitely worth returning."}
{"text":"Drove from Marysville looking for something unique and came across this. The service was fantastic, everyone was super polite and professional. The red sangria is delicious as is the food! Maybe a little more than I'd spend on a normal lunch but so worth that treat."}
{"text":"Paella was amazing. The lamb shank special was also delicious. If I find myself in the area again I would come back in a minute. The service was top notch as well."}
{"text":"I went here to see a performance by Justo Saborit, which was fabulous. Also fabulous was the food, drink and service. Gentleman friend was also impressed. The sauteed calamari was my fave but everything was delicious. We will be back, even if Justo isn't there! But that was a bonus."}
{"text":"This is a terrific restaurant. The food is amazing. If you've never experienced the Spanish practice of Tapas, this is the place to try it. It's a little like Dim Sum, you get a bunch of small dishes -- who in our two visits trying different things each time -- whose quality is uniformly excellent. Besides a nice restaurant area, there is also a bar and television area, perfect for watching the game, having a beer and enjoying some of the best appetizer plates you've ever had. Highly recommend the grouper tacos, the bacon wrapped quail and the flan. Great date kinda place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spanish resturant. The seafood is moderately priced yet cooked to perfection every time. The staff are excellent and the Sangria is magnificent. I literally come here and say \"take my money.\""}
{"text":"I love this place. An unpretentious exterior hides a jewel of an establishment. White table cloths and waiters in suits assure you have a wonderful dining experience at an affordable price. The cuisine and presentation are high quality, (we ordered and were thrilled with Bassa, Flounder, and flan).  I only wish I had visited years ago, but will be a regular from now on. Many more menu items to explore.  Did I mention I love this place ......"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you just want to tell everyone about because it's such an awesome all around experience!! I went here with a group of 18. First we met in the bar and had drinks. They have a great happy hour which goes until 7, and they even have free food for you to nibble on during that time!! The menu is super long and will have you wanting to return even before you order. I'd recommend the Paella, but it's hard to go wrong with any of it. The service for our group was AMAZING!!! They didn't falter once in keeping up with us or keeping our checks straight, which is typically difficult with a bigger group. Overall we were all so happy with the experience and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I could put no stars I would. We come from Pittsburgh and decided to go there because of the good reviews. We got there around 4:30 and the parking lot was almost empty which is a red flag but  it was still early so we decided to give it a try. Once seated we ordered white sangria to start and what we got was a pitcher full of Tropicana orange juice ice and a little bit of alcohol. I took one sip and it was disgusting I don't know how can a restaurant call that \"white sangria\" we left right away if that's what they served for drink I definitely don't want to try the rest"}
{"text":"A party of 5 went this past Sunday.  It had rained earlier in the day so I called ahead to see if they had patio seating available.  They said they would dry off a table for us and get it ready.  We all thought that was great service.  When we arrived, our table was ready and we had the patio to ourselves.

We ordered several tapas and a pitcher of red sangria.  The sangria was perfect.  Not one complaint on any of the tapas either---artichokes, fish tacos, tomato/cheese on toast points, a couple of wonderful salads and croquettes.

The service was exceptional and they even brought all of us a shot of a Portugese almond liquor which we devoured.  

There were not many people here, although it was around 6PM on a Sunday, but I desperately hope this restaurant stays open.  The food was great, the sangria very tasty and the service is probably the best I have encountered in months. 

All 5 of us swore we would return and I, for one, can't wait to go back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Boyfriend took me here last Friday after we were recommended this place by a friend. Wow! I only wish we came sooner! I'm obsessed with their tapas menu! We want to try everything!
I ordered the red Sangria (yummy!) And he got some kind of Spanish beer, I'm not sure. We shared the octopus with oregano, shrimp cancun, chicken kabobs, amd shrimp ceviche. Everything was delicious! The grilled octopus is the BEST, most tender and flavorful I've ever had! I've thought about the octopus every day since! Haha! I wanted to order more food but I was completely stuffed! We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like restaurant going royalty.  They gave us plenty of extras to make our dining experience extraordinary.  Free soup, after dinner drink.  Feels very ethnic and the staff just cares about all they do.  Food was very good, lots of seafood options, but just the perfect kind of date spot.  I'm a fan of foreign foods especially served by people of the culture.  Definitely on our short list of places to return to!"}
